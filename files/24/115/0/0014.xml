CM.9i:\9JM4ilr?. .M ^ho Postmaster-General.)(1)  A conference of Uinisters on the 21st July decidedthat &quot;man on foreign service under normal peace conditions should pay postage at the domestic rate (now 2d.)&quot;.(2)  The domestic (i.e. Inland) letter rate is at present2d. for letters not exceeding&apos; 3ozs. with an additionalfor each succeeding ounce.  The Imperial rate is 2d. forthe first ounce and Id. for each additional ounce.(3)  As regards letters not exceeding loz. which constitute the great bulk of the mail, no difficulty arises, as the domestic rate is identical with the Imperial rate, and whenthe Conference arrived at this conclusion I thins it wasonly ordinary letters which entered into the discussion.(4)  As regards men in the Army and the Air Force serving in British Dominions or Possessions, a special rate couldnot be granted without the consent of tho local Governmentin each case;  and if a special rate were granted it wouldbe necessary for each letter to bear on the cover the name and class of tho writer and the -signature of his commanding officer as a certificate.   This cumbrous procedure would clearly not be worth whilo for the sa.tce of the very small number of letters which exceed the minimum weight, especially as in many oarts of tho Empire the initial rate for letters to this Country is leas than 2d.  fior would it be worthwhile in India, whexe the rate of If annas for the first o.z..is now equivalent to abouit   d. in British currency.  On
practical grounds,  therefore, members  of  tho forces  inBritish Dominions and  Possessions must  nay  tho ordinarycivilian rate  for letters  to  this Country.(5)  In ths oase of sailors,  whoso letters  are usuallydespatched in  spocial  bags, it would not  bo impracticable to establish a different -rate for tho heavier lettare,and tho Admiralty dasiro that this should be done.(6)  But I think it is undesirable to introduce thocomplication of a special roto &quot;for those  letters, whichprobably do not exceed one or two per thousand, and inparticular to  establish a preferential rate for sailorswhich is not applicable to soldiers serving in the samelocality.
