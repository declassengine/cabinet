UNEMPLOYMENT.Memorandum for the Cabinet by Mr, Long.          I feel profoundly anxious about the questionof unemployment.          I see from the S.S. reports that reference ismade to the great Increase in numbers and it seems to bethe general opinion that , at this moment, it is by far the most serious cause of unrest among the industrialclasses,,           I venture to intervene because I have a verylively recollection of the situation we had to face in1900 to 1903 or 4,  I was then at tho L.G-.B. and 1 knowhow profound the feeling was, especially in London.           We passed an Unemployment Act setting up a body charged with power to deal with this particular problem. &quot; It was violently criticised, not aloner byMembers of my own Party including Members of theGovernment, but by Mr. Burns and those who sharedhis very orthodox vieWs.            I was not, and am not now, enamoured ofthe scheme, but it had this distinct advantage, itdisposed of the dangerous and wholly unsatisfactory cry1,that &quot;the only resort, fur the respectable unemployedis the workhouse, or outdoor relief with its accompanyingcivil disabilities&quot;.            I firmly believe that if the industrialclasses, who are now contemplating with horror anddismay long periods of unemployment, realise thatthere is in every big town a local authority, whollyremoved from the Guardians and the Poor Law , who candeal with unemployment as a temporary^evil that much ofthe discontent and unrest would disappear.            I have always regretted that Mr. Burns^ whenhe succeeded to the Local Government Board in 1906,carried his views on these questions so far that hewould not allow tho system, that we had set up, to begiven even a fair trial.   I never claimed for it thatit was more than an experiment but it was an experimentworthy of trial and I cannot help thinking that these committees ought to be set up without delay, or at all events, that a small Committee should be setup to report to the Cabinet.            As a London Member I can answer for It that unemployment is steadily growing and that there is a wide spread feeling, by no means confined to the wageearning classes, that Government ought to intervenebetween them and the impending disasters.(intld.)    W. H. L.17th November,1920.
