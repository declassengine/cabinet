I desire  to  offer oortain  observations with  regard  tp  theeraorandum  (C*P.  1932) circulated by the Secretary of State for india a the general  question of  the  position of tho Ministry  of  Labour inelation  to tho international labour organisation.    I wish to  make  it clear that at no time was  it contemplatod bya that the Ministry of labour  should in international labour mattersBsume the dominating position  suggested by the Secretary of State, aoaition  which  would not merely be  inconsistent with interdepartmentalourtesy, &quot;but which would, as  he points  out, be unconstitutional inlew of the recent changes in  the  status of India.   In connection with my memorandum to  the Cabinet, dated 1st October,)9p31939J the Secretary  of State  for  tho Colonies  has written to meaggs sting that while a formal co-operation with  the Dominions, such3 I had originally hoped for, is  not  for various reasons practicable,k British Government officials concerned in  the work of the International3bour Organisation should keep in touch, semi-officially, with the^responding officials in Canada,  Australia,  New Zealand% and the Unionf South Africa.   In Lord Milne^s view consultation should be kept toicse channels rather than by  the  matter being formally brought before39 Cabinet.   I prefer not to enter into controversy with  the Secretary of state3 to the action of the British Government Delegates at the Genoainference.   In justice to them,  however, I must state that I am satis-led. that they afforded the fullest possible assistance to the Indian      JNigERMIXONAL  LABOURMemorandum by the Minister of labour.legates.flnita.)  3J.
