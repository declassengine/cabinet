I LIU ir i M \JLII I mlIU.2133   i Ills Document K tho D.-^         CABINET.jffiESRIAl ROADS IN LONDON flOR THE   RELIEF OF THE UNEMPLOYED.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the       Minister of Transport.         I desire to inform my colleagues of the presentposition of this matter.  They will remember that the sohemoas originally put forward was one under which the government itself would have undertaken the full responsibility for themaking of the Arterial Roads in the London area* but later itwas found possible to make financial arrangements with theLondon County Council under which they agreed to contribute 50$of tho oost and the work was to be done through the borough councils.         The London County Oounoil are by statute theAuthority charged with  the improvement of roads and streetsin their area.  During  the negotiations with them they pointedout that it would.be necessary for the Government to obtain forthem  powers enabling them to get early possession of the landupon  which the new arterial roads would be constructed.  Thisview  had already boen anticipated by the parliamentary secretary  to the Ministry of (Transport at the CabinetUnemployment Committee  of which he is a member.   Shis committee agreed  that such powers were desirable,  and  it was arranged thatthe Ministry of  Transport should deal with the Bill departmentally.Accordingly a Bill wa3  drafted and settled by parliamentary counsel and presented to  the Home Affairs Committee.  This  Billwa3  of  a drastic  character.  It  enabled  immediate possession  tobe taken of any land subject to  the Local Authority  orappropriate Government  Department  taking such possession,giving  seven  days notice  to  the  occupier of  the  land,  if  any,
and if none by posting a notice in conspicuous places on thoproperty itself.          It will he realised that the powers sought wontboyond anything which Parliament had heretofore sanctioned,and the Home Affairs Committee on consideration of the Billcame to the conclusion that tho proposals wore not suoh as would he likely to commend themselves to either House,  lfteytherefore suggested that a more moderate measure should hedrafted following with as little modification as possible thelines of the Housing and Sown Planning Act of 1919, whiohoontains a power under which the local Authority having &quot;been authorised by an Order of the Minister of Health to takeland compulsorily can by serving notice to troat upon thoowner and giving 14 days1 notioe enter upon the land without waiting for the ascertainment of the amount of compensation payable; such compensation being subsequently determined bythe Official Arbitrates         Upon the issue of. this Bill as approved by the.Home Affairs Committee, objection was taken by the londonCounty council  that it did not provide a procedure of suchexpedition as they had boon led to expect.   !they pointed outthat their experience of this procedure insofar as it related to Housing Schemes had shown  it to be inappropriate  to  meetthe present emergency.         In the discussion on the second reading of  theBill, ^Sir Henry Harris, Member  for Paddington, read  thefollowing resolution from the County Counoil:-                &quot;On  the faith  of undertakings  given by         &quot;vthe  Government  to promote  legislation to secure         &quot;the  prompt  acquisition  of  the necessary  land,         &quot;the  Council undertake to assist  the Government          &quot;in  carrying out  its schemes  to provide  employment          &quot;by  the  construction of  arterial  ro;xds,  but the          &quot;Bill as  introduced  completely fails to  achieve          &quot;this  object, and unless altered  radically will          &quot;render  nugatory the Counoil!s  desire to  proceed          *with the work  in question&quot;.
I aooordingly requested tho Parliamentary Secretary to  get intouch with tho County Council with a view to removing any mis-understandings and arranging for their full and complete co-operation in pressing forward the necessary work.          Mr.Neal received the deputation to-day (22ndinstant) which included Sir Cyril Jackson, Chairman of theUnemployment Committee, London County Council, and Dr*5cott-Lidgett and other Members of the Council and their principaloffioials.  Mr.Keal was prossed very strongly as to the reasons why the Bill as  introduced had not been more drastic and itwas  stated that  the public utterances of prominent Members oftho  Government lod the unemployed in London to anticipatebeing put on to  employment within a few days after the passageof  the Bill or oven before th&amp;a25iey went so  far as tosuggest  that the Government had gone back upon the promiseswhich had been made to  them, and  that the  consequences whenthe  matter came  to be discussod before tho Council meeting to-morrow might  be serious.           2he Parliamentary Secretary endeavoured  to showthat tho Bill as it now stands, would, in  view of  theexperience gained by  the Minister of Health,  enable land tobe  acquired under tho procedure contemplated within a  very short  time after its passage through  the  House providedthat the  County Council on their  side opened negotiationsforthwith with  the  owners  of land to be  required and wereby the  time  the  Bill  received  royal  assent in a  position  toknow, in  what  oases  it would  be necessary to  exercise  thepowers.          He  explained  to  them the  course  of procedure and pointed  out  that when once they had arrived at a conclusion to
put into force provisions of the Act in respect of any particular land, they ought to be in a position to take possession of it within a period of loss than a month from the time of making their application. In the meantime, the existence of such powers to take possession of land speedily, if necessary very much facilitated nego&apos;lations and enabled them to see their way to the completion of a work from end to end without interruption and at once to commence work on such lands as they had or could acquire.

Certain criticisms of details of the Bill were raised, but the real difficulty is that the County Council do not consider the proposals of the present Bill sufficiently drastic to enable them to face the unemployed or to suggest that they can immediately find some relief work.

As above indicated, there is a meeting of the County Council to be hold to-morrow, and the deputation assured Mr.Neal that very strong things were likely to be said about the failure of the Government to bring in a sufficiently drastic measure, and that the result would probably be further demonstrations by the unemployed.

Mr.Neal strongly urged that there should be complete co-operation between the Government and the London County Council, and arranged for consultations to take place to-day between the legal advisers of the Ministry of  Transport and of the Council as to any amendments, desired within the scope of the Bill and between the Engineers, with a view to seeing what, if any, land was immediately available for work and in what state negotiations for acquiring land now stood and to ascertain how far procedure could be expedited.
