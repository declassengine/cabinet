Egyptian press reports state that it isthe intention of British Government $rant Egypt what amountsto independent government this done on the recommendationof LorcL Milnor&apos;s commission.   Last week further coblesreported CurKon denies that Government had decided thisquestion but that It was considering or going to considerLord Milner1s report,   In absence of any direct information                   is completelyCommonwealth Government/in darkness as to what facts arebut is much perturbed at suoh a policy as rooommendod bylord, Mllnor1 s Commission.
