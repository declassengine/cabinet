This  document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.THE  CABINET.WAY  CONCESSIONS  TO  TROOPS  IN  THE  UNITED                         KINGDOM.     MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR  WAR.    I  circulate herewith  a Memorandum,  supplementary to that  dated  30th  June  J[(CP.   1622), which  has  been  prepared  by  the Joint Secretary  and  Accounting &quot;GenOfficer  of the War Office  on the question of reintroducing railway concessions enjoyed   ^by the  Army before the war.                                                                  w. s. c.    THE WAR  OFFICE,         19th November, 1920. ,     I desire to call attention to the War Office Memorandum (CP. 1622) on the abovesubject dated 30th June.     Correspondence with the Treasury has  been proceeding since that date, and theposition reached is this:      All the concessions  detailed  in the  Memorandum, which  before the war  were granted to  the personnel  of the Army by the railway companies without any questionarising of charges to public funds, have been withdrawn by the railway companies.     The Treasury has agreed that the first three concessions, with certain restrictions,may be continued on the  condition that Army Funds pay the  difference between therate paid by the individual (single fare for return journey, &amp;c.) and the full rate whichthe companies are empowered to charge.   These concessions are  :-     1. To officers proceeding on leave, a return ticket on payment of single fare from           certain military stations to London.             The Treasury imposes the restriction  that this concession be limited to           periods of leave of seven days or over, with effect from 1st October, 1920.           This has the effect of defeating the main object of the  concession, which is not           to encourage the taking of a full week&apos;s leave but to enable officers to attend           military functions, lectures on subjects bearing on their profession, &amp;c.     2. To soldiers proceeding on leave, a return ticket, on payment of single fare, when           granted leave of seven days or over.     3. Nurses, soldiers&apos; wives and children, under 16, Army school mistresses and pupil           teachers can obtain return tickets on payment of single fare.     Soldiers&apos; wives and  children were entitled to one concession per annum, but theTreasury excludes soldiers&apos; wives and children entirely, with effect from 1st October.     The remaining pre-war  concessions took the form of cheap fares on  the followingoccasions:      4. Parties of troops  of 10  and upwards attending memorial services and military           funerals.      - .     5. Competitors, teams, working-parties, horses, guns, &amp;c,  proceeding annually to           the Royal Tournament.     6. Soldiers proceeding on leave, in  uniform, from Aldershot  and  Chatham to           London.     7. Soldiers in uniform proceeding to rifle ranges for practice.     8. Boys of the Duke of York&apos;s, Royal Hibernian and Queen Victorias Military Schools           when going on holiday.     All these have  been  withdrawn by  the railway companies, acting apparently on instructions  from  the  Ministry .of Transport.  In one case at least  there is reason to     (B20/460)  100 11/20 H&amp;S, Ltd  8709wo
suppose that the companies  if left to themselves  would continue the concession.  TheTreasury refuses to allow the railway companies to be pressed  to  restore them, though some (if not all) of them were reductions made on business grounds to attract  traffic,but stipulates that the  question  should be reconsidered when the railway  companiesreintroduce  cheap fares or bookings for the general public.  A small beginning in thisdirection was made this autumn, but  I understand it is  not considered sufficient  toauthorize the reopening of the question now.    I  feel that  the troops, in view of the  restrictions on their  personal liberty that military service  involves, have a strong claim to be  treated no worse in these respectsthan they were before the war, and I ask that the Treasury restrictions under 1  and  3may be withdrawn, and that I may be authorized to charge upon the estimates the costof restoring items 4, 5, 7 and 8 to the troops.   (Item 6, applying to two stations only,could not be charged upon the Estimates without giving rise to  claims to extension  toall stations, and  I  do  not therefore include it.)  The &quot; cost&quot; in question, in my opinion,should be interpreted as meaning such sum as will  make good to the companies whatthe traffic really costs them, and not the statute^ rates chargeable to the public.C.
