Draft Russian Trade Agreement.     Memorandum fry the President of the Board of Trade.     In the aooompanying redraft of the trade agreement Ihave attempted to give effect to the decisions of the Cabinet/:(C*fcLnet 62 ( 0))     Material . additions to the draft then considered are under-lined in the present draft.     From Clause 9, the words &quot;or of any allied Government&quot;have been emitted after &quot;the property of the British Government&quot;as Allied Governments would themselves initiate action if they made any claim.  Also the words &quot;on the ground of any claims .against Russian citizens or against the Russian Soviet Govern-ment or against the former Governments of Russia&quot; have beendeleted as they seemed unnecessary.     Certain small verbal alterations have been made to &apos;which attention need not be directed; for instance the wordsnv;bioh have been&quot; are inserted in four places in Clause VIIImerely to avoid the phrase &quot;servioes rendered&quot; whioh,.Iunderstand might bo construed in a limited technical sense.
