Copy l:Jo.  _    OoP.,-3144.                            . C A B  I l\ E  T,DISPUTE BET?rEEis LITHUANIA &amp; POLA1JD,Note by the Secretary General on tho organisation for the  taking of a popular expression of opinion in Lithuania provided forby the Resolution of the Council of October 28th,  1920,(Circulated for information).     At its meeting of October 28th 1920 at Brussels,  thoCouncil of the Lea6ue of nations adopted a Resolution  recommend-Ing to the Governments of Poland end Lithuania a settlement  oftheir territorial differences in the Vilna area by means of  a popular expression of opinion, .   In two  communications which reached Monsieur Leon Bourgeois  on November 7th,  the partiesaccepted this recommendation.  The Council has now to  decideupon the measures which may bo necessary to carry it intooffee to     With re6ari to -this matter, three questions arise:-     1*   What are the boundaries of the Territory which shall give this expression of opinion?     2U   In what way shall this opinion be expressed?     3.*   What are the practical means necessary for ensuring the execution of-these measures?              1,  PELIMITATION 0? THE TERRITORY,8.U__To the West.     The Resolution of October 28th shows that the popularopinion shall be e,,pressed in an area east of the line ofOctober 8th, 1919, sometimes oalled &quot;the Curzon Line&quot;*
     A corriLiurJ.communication.oii.from the&apos;Lithuanian Charge  e &apos;Affairesin London which 77a;:. received on November lot,  expresses thedesire that the popular opinion may be consulted in certain districts (scini and punsk)&apos; which lie west ef  this line.  this extension would obviously be contrary tc the intentions of theCouncil though the latter in no way wishes to  express an opinion on any definite frontier between Poland  and Lithuaniain the suwalki area as to which the Lithuanian Government has expressed certain reservations.(^b^^To^the souths     in the south, the Military Commission of  Control proposes that the popular opinion be consulted up to that line which  was recognised as the frontier of Lithuania by the Treaty of July12th, 192n, between the Lithuanian Government  and the SovietGovernment i     Such a delimitation does not seem to meet with any opposition from either Lithuania or Poland.ipLT 0 the JKfcr th -     No line exists which has been accepted by both parties.in his communication of. November 1st, the Lithuanian Charged&apos;Affaires in London proposes the line of demarcation traceden November 7th at suwalki.  But Vilna is north of this line,and  it ia  evident that it is the Council&apos;e intention to decide the  fate of Vilna and its area on a b.asi3 of a popular expression of opinion.  The line of demarcation between Lithuanian and poland traced by Marshal pooh in 1919, which runs parallel  tothe  railway from Groano to Dvinsk and passes 30 k.m. north  ofVilna, could be adoptea as, the northern boundary of  theterritory  subject to the popular consultation.
Another line, lying somewhat further north, is the boundary of these countries which were under the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian Tariba before the Bolshevik offensive of this year. It can be said that the whole Zone comprised between this frontier called that of the "Tariba" and that of the Treaty between Lithuania and the Soviets of July 12th last, has never regularly belonged to any constituted State since the dissolution  of the Russian Empire: in 1919 it was occupied by Polish Armies. For a part of this year it was occupied by the Soviet Armies. It was thereafter ? to Lithuania by the Treaty of July 12th, but this Treaty which was never recognised by any Power except Germany, is in contradiction with the provisions of the preliminaries of Peace of Riga between the Soviets and Poland. Moreover, a part of the territory delimited by this line, continued to be occupied by soviet troops, up to the moment when they were expelled by the polish Army.

In any case, the frontier called that "of the Tariba"on one side, and the frontier of July 12th on the other should be the extreme limits within which the popular expression of opinion should be taken.

In the north-east these two lines meet on the Dwina, above Dvinsk.

The parties could be invited to agree as to the northern limit of the Zone for the expression of opinion. If this agreement could not be reached, the Council might decide on the basis of the recommendations of its Commission.
     2,   METHOD &amp; ORGANISATION OF THE POPULAR EXPRESSION          OF&apos;&quot; oHfriwr      The words &quot;Consultation populaire&quot;  (popular expression ofopinion) used  in the resolution of October 28th, show that theCouncil has decided to preserve complete liberty of action in determining the method by which the opinion of the populationcan bo ascertained.  The Plebiscite, properly so-called, byregularly constituted vote under secret ballott has, in spiteof P11 possible guarantees, shown itself somewhat unsatisfactoryin many cases\ owing to the delays which it involves 0During the period preparatory to the consultation,  the  sdminis-tration of the debat vibie territory must first be assured;this entails considerable expenditure and difficulties,  and the longer this1 period lasts9 the more will the opposingparties be tempted to use various methods of propaganda whichhave the effect of influencing and of distorting the popularexpression of opiniono      The Military Commission sent to Lithuania for the purposeof ensuring the carrying out of the Council1s resolution,  has suggested a summary and rapid system for this consultation^The country should be divided into shout ten districts,  eachof which should bo surveyed by a.commission of three officersaccompanied by a Polish find by a Lithuanian assessor,  this commission should call together in each district a sort ofgeneral assembly of the population,  after which an official re-port, recording the views which have been ascertained.,  shouldbe drawn up,      Evidently this method should not be applied to the towns,particularly to the town of vilna which has more than 1-50,000inhabitants,  Moreover, precautions  should be taken that
the pressure which night falsify the result of a. plebiscitemay not be changed in this case to even more brutal methods of compulsion.      It would seem absolutely necessary that civil ccmnisjjixjners-j,taken preferably from among those who have worked on the organ-isation of other popular consultations? should be appointed to               make on tho spot a rapid survey of the particular conditionsin which this consultation might take place,  Thoy shouldf  atthe same time^ acquaint themselves with the feelings of thoPolish and Lithuanian Governments, with a view to finding asolution which would not provoke an opposition from either ofthe interested parties sufficient to compromise the result.      fuie of their f&amp;might duties, in view of an equitable solutionof the case, shall be to determine whether the result of the popular consultation shall decide the fate of the wholeterritory in dispute, or tho fate of  each particular district;the definite delimitation of the frontier being, in the latter case, reserved for the Gsu&amp;cil on the basis of the indicationsfurnished by its commission a              3 6   PRACTICAL MEAKS OF EXECUTION^      It is laid down in the resolution of 28th October thatthe troops at present occupying tho contested territory shouldbo removed or disarmed during the period of  consultation0      These troops fall into three categoriesj      1,   The regular troops of  the  Polish army      2o   General geligowsk^s troops  at  present occupying           Vilna and&apos; its neighbourhoods      3*   The Lithuanian troopsc                          -5-
     With regard to the PollBh.--and-I4ttamriian troops, the twoGovernments may be induced to agree to the temporary evacuation of the territories they occupy.   In view of the fact, however.,that the Treaty of Peace between Poland and Soviet Russia if, notyet definitely signed, the Military Oommissiou has pointed out thattho Polish troops might be allowed to occupy a small number of strategic points in order that the military situation should notbe compromised, in case hostilities should begin again.   Itappears possible fore this to be done &quot;without the presence of these troops at a few places seriously influencing the results of the consul tat ion,,     For the troops of General Ze.ligowK.ki the question iu moredelicate.   It is certain that they will not leave the territory which they occupy, and the Polish Government declares itsinability to drive the-&apos; out.    On^ could doubtless manage tohave them temporarily removed, so that they should not be presentin a district at the moment when the consultation was to be held.     Or again, in the case of soldiers who are natives of thedistrict and who consequently would be taking part in tho Con-sultation, it would be possible to request their disarmamentduring the operations of- the Commission.     The city,of Vilna offers the most difficult problem.For indeed the method of summary consultation is not applicableto this city, and, although in theory it would be possible toremove the troops at the time of voting, in practice any suchcourse of action would meet with the most determined opposition.     One might endeavour to overcome this difficulty by organ-ising a consultation by districts.     All these details, however, could only be determined afterstudying the question on the spot.   Such action appears to beindispensable.
     In tho Resolution of October 20th it is laid down that thetroops fur-nishod by the Members of the League represented on theOounoil, shall guard the roads and railway lines which cross orlead to the disputed territory.   The aim of this provision Is toprevent the transfer of armed forces or of war material belongingto Poland or Lithuania, as well as the leaking through of elementsfrom East Prussia.  &apos; To assure the provision of those troops,whose total number has been estimated at about 1,000, the Govern-ments of States Members of the Council of the League of nations have been approached.   The force thus constituted shall be under theorders of the-lillitary Commission of Control.   With regard to thearrangements relating to transport and commisssffsat, use  could bemade of tho facilities at the disposal of the inter-allied organi-sation,     A Special Note deals with the question of the financial settlement.2, Whitehall Gardens.
