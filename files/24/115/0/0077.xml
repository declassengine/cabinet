[This Document is  the Property of His  Britannic  Majestys Government,]SECRET.NAVAL POLICY AND CONSTRUCTION.emorandum for the Cabinet by the  First Lord of the Admiralty.: c. it                                            PART  I.            I BEG  that the Cabinet will give their early attention  to the question of  &quot; Naval        Policy and Construction.&quot;            Part II of this Memorandum expresses the fully considered and unanimous views        of the  Board of Admiralty on the necessity of providing for a moderate programme        of new construction in the Navy Estimates for 1921-22.            That this  would  be  necessary has  already  been  foreshadowed  in the various        Memoranda dealing with Naval Policy that 1 have circulated to the Cabinet.           . It will be remembered that just a year ago iiy the Admiralty Memorandum of the        24th October, 1919, on Naval  Policy and Expenditure, the minimum iSaval Force        necessary ia the then  existing circumstances  for  the security of  the Empire was set        forth.  It was pointed out that even with,  this  Force Great Britain would no longer be        supreme  upon  the sea, and further, that  a point would shortly be reached  when it        must be  finally decided whether we shall or shall  not accept the position of Second        Naval Power.            I quote  the words which were used:                  &quot; Our immediate position with the United States  will be one approximately            of equality, but it will rapidly become one of marked  inferiority if we undertake            no new  construction and the United States continue their 1916 Programme, which            consists  of capital ships much more powerful than any British  ships with the            exception of the &quot;Hood.&apos;   By the end of the year  1923 we shall  have passed to            the position of  being the  Second  N aval Power unless                &quot; either (a) the United States  can  be induced by diplomatic means (whether by                            use  of the machinery provided  by Article 8  of the Covenant of                            the  League of Nations or otherwise)  to abandon or modify their                            1916 Programme ;               &quot; or     (b)  the decision  to  start no  programme  of new  construction  is                            reconsidered, in the light of the United States&apos; action in twelve                            months&apos; time from now.&quot;            -  &apos;        / ^             -.                .    .  &apos;    .  .     ,  /          In a further Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet  dealing with  the Navy 9 /    Estimates on the 1.3th February, 1920, the foregoing argument was emphasised.  It../. bxfb&quot; was clearly pointed out that equality with the United States  in naval  strength is the        lowest position that should be accepted as compatible  with our vast maritime responsi-        bilities, and that  if such  equality cannot  be  secured by an understanding  with the        United States, it would ]De necessary to ensure it by adopting definitely a &quot; One-Power        Standard&quot; as  compared  with  the  strongest Naval  Power, and  by  taking action        accordingly.            The Admiralty views were considered and discussed very fully at  more than one        meeting  of the Cabinet and of the Finance Committee,  and in  introducing the Navy        Estimates on the 17th March  last I used the following words as indicating the policy        of the  Government:                  &quot; I believe it is a fact that the naval policies  of all past Governments, which-             ever Party they represented, have at least  included this common principle, that             our  Navy should not be inferior  in strength to the Navy of other Powers, and to             this principle the  present  Government  firmly  adheres. ....  That is the             foundation of  the Naval Policy of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,   This  is not  a             matter  for the Admiralty ;  this is a  matter for the  Government,  and this is the             policy which  we have deliberately adopted, and I,, at least, think it is  a policy             which will commend itself to the House of Commons and the country.&quot;            .   [4647]                                                           B
     I coupled with this statement an expression of hope that if there is any emulation between us  and the United States it would be in the direction of mutually reducing naval strength.     It is common knowledge that no response  whatever has been made by the United States to our known wishes in this matter. -  No curtailment of their 1916 Programme has been made; indeed, their policy has been precisely in the  opposite directiou.     Consequently, we have now reached the critical  time which  was  foreseen in the Admiralty Memoranda already  quoted, when we must either lay down  new  ships in order to maintain  approximate equality with the United States or must accept the fact that in three years from now our position will be one of marked inferiority.     It will be seen  from Appendix I to this Paper that Great Britain has one Capital Ship  and one only that embodies war experience in an important degree, namely, the &quot; Hood.&quot;  Unless we start building  now we still shall have only  the &quot; Hood &quot;  in 1925. The United  States by 1925 will  have 12 Capital  Ships of over  40,000 tons  of post- Jutland  design embodying war experience in an important degree, as well as 4 such ships  of over  30,000 tons.   Japan  will have  at least 8 such  ships, most of them of over 40,000 tons by 1925, and  by  1928 will have 16.     On the other hand, the number of Capital Ships that we must strike off our list in the immediate future as obsolete far exceeds the number of ships that must similarly drop  out of  the United States and Japanese Fleets.   It will be  seen from the Table attached to  Appendix I that we shall lose 18 ships, whilst the United States lose only 8, and Japan only 2.    These figures are so striking that I need scarcely  point out that a  decision not  to build would mean much more than relinquishing the position of first Naval Power.  It would mean resting content with an out-of-date Fleet.    It would damage the efficiency of the personnel as much as that of the materiel. .     It is impossible for the superb quality of our officers and men to be maintained with materiel no longer up-to-date as  compared with that of other great Fleets.    I am of course alive to the fact that there is  a very general  opinion that actual war between the United States and  ourselves  is impossible.  I  hold  this view  very strongly  myself, but  I venture to urge that it offers  no  justification  for adopting a policy here which  would deliberately sacrifice our sea supremacy.    I venture to urge also that it is folly to  suppose that we can sink to second, and it may  be to  third, place and yet retain  the prestige and  advantages  of first place, merely by insisting  on omitting the United States  from  our calculations.  The rest of the world will  not omit the United States, and will recognise easily  enough who is  first and who is second.    The improbability of war between the United States and ourselves is in  point of fact the sole justification for admitting &quot; approximate equality &quot; between us as consistent with the  security of the Empire.   If  any other Power say, Japan were in question, the Admiralty would press  for,  and  the Empire  would  demand, much more than &quot;approximate equality.&quot;    Consequent upon the late War  it is more  than  ever necessary  to  consider the feelings of  the Oversea Dominions and the Colonies in any shipbuilding programme, and if Japan is allowed to forge ahead in Capital  Ships, Australia and New Zealand may lose that sense of security which contributes to bind them to the Empire.    It is not, however, necessary  to lay stress in public on  the naval expansion of the United States or Japan, or to refer, except in the general terms that have already been used,  to the question of standard.    As regards the  remainder of the Admiralty proposals, the only item on  which I wish  to  comment separately is  the completion  of  the partly-built  vessels in the dockyards.   In addition to the primary consideration of naval  strength, it is importanton general  grounds that this should be done.    All  the  vessels  to  be completed are so far finished that to  leave them  in theirpresent state  involves serious deterioration,  and is  financially a most wasteful policy. Politically also the presence of these  partly-finished and deteriorating ships aifords a valuable  object-lesson to the agitator, and  is doing great harm to the  Government inthe dockyard towns.    I attach a Statement (Appendix II) showing the cost involved by the programme. The  amount that will  fall upon  the  Estimates  for  1921-22  is 14*7  millions approximately;  for 1922-23, 20&apos;0 millions; for 1923-24, 21*3  millions, after which the cost diminishes again.    I would  point out that  these  figures are based on present prices,  which are from 2-^ to 3 times as high as  pre-war  prices, and that if the  adjustment to pre-war prices
be  made, the expenditure  upon  new  construction proposed  for  1920-21  is  verymoderate as compared with  the  18^ millions included  in the Estimates for  1914-15.It is indeed necessary to go back more than 25 years long before the development ofthe German menace to find as low a figure.  This is a sufficient indication, 1 hope, ofthe fact that  the Board of  Admiralty are fully alive to the financial exigencies of thetime, and have refrained from pressing for any expenditure  save what is  absolutely essential for the  security of the Empire.                                    PART II     To carry out the Government policy and maintain a &quot; One-Power Naval Standard,&quot;an  examination  of  relative  strengths shows that the  commencement of a  building programme in the financial year  1921-22 will be required.     2. It should first be stated that in  any comparison between  the  strength of theBritish Navy and that of a foreign Power, it is not sufficient to consider total numbers.If comparison is to be  of  value, full  consideration must be given to the age of thevarious vessels  comprising  the  fleets, their displacement, armament and endurance.The reason for this  is that war experience resulted in  a rapid advance in the design of war vessels, introducing improvement not only in gun and torpedo power, but alsoin protection qualities and endurance.     These improvements, together with the lessened life of British Ships consequent on  the enormous strain of war,  caused  by continuous  steaming  at high speeds, sea-keeping  under  all  conditions of weather,  and refits of a shortened duration at longerintervals, have rendered  our earlier Capital Ships obsolete, and unable to  hold their positions in the  Line of Battle.     3. The relative position  of  strength as between Great Britain, the United Statesand Japan, assuming no  British  building programme, is  explained in  Appendix  I, inwhich due weight has been  given to  the improvements referred to in paragraph above.   From this it  will  be seen that  our  position  is serious, and  if we are tomaintain a &quot; One-Power  Standard &quot; it will  be necessary to lay  down 4 replace capital ships  in 1921 and a further  4  in 1922.   The  relative  position  at the  end of  1925,assuming  this  building  programme  is  canned out,  and  no  further construction programme is commenced by the  United States or Japan, is explained in Appendix I.     4. The  adoption  of this  building  programme will  place us in a more favourable position to follow  any policy of replacement of obsolescent ships adopted  by  otherMaritime Powers ; but apart from this it must be emphasised that this programme isthe minimum for  safety, and even with it there will  be a period (1923-25) when weshall have actually fallen below the &quot; One-Power Standard &quot; and be somewhat inferiorin  fighting strength to the United States.     5. In regard to Light Cruisers and  Destroyers,  our position is such that actual new construction will be unnecessary at present, and  it will  be sufficient  if in the financial year  1921-22 the  Light Cruisers and  Destroyers  already laid  down are completed and  replace older classes of  similar vessels.   This will involve the comple- tion of  the  &quot; Cape Town,&quot; 2 &quot;Effinghams,&quot; 3 &quot;D&quot; Class and 2  &quot;E &quot; Class Light Cruisers and certain Destroyers, progress on which  has  been suspended in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards.     6. A new programme of  submarine construction is not required to be  undertaken during 1921-22, but submarines now building should be completed.   The argument of gradual replacement  in the  case of  Capital  Ships does  not apply  so definitely  to submarines, which are  more rapidly  and comparatively  cheaply  built, and it  is an advantage  to  wait  and gain  the result  of  experience  in  a trial  submarine  of modifications in control and developments in  the internal  combustion engine, both of  which it  is believed will considerably  affect  present-day practice  in  submarine construction.     Money  for the  construction of such a trial submarine in which the whole of the experimental work, both as  regards hull and  engine  design, can be concentrated, is therefore required.   This will enable us to keep abreast of the latest scientific thought on this subject, and so be prepared to build a suitable type when required.      7.  There remains the question of special types of vessels required by the sea-going fleet  under  modern conditions, and the need  for which did not exist in the  same measure before the war.  These include Aeroplane Carriers and  Minelayers.      8.  On the vital importance of Air Power  in  all  naval  work in  the future it  is unnecessary to  insist in  this paper.  We are at present urgently in need of further data and experience.
     The efficiency of the Fleet depends now, and will depend still more in the future, upon its being equipped with a sufficiency of aircraft.     As a result of this development Aircraft Carriers have become an essential adjunct  Q in the organization of a Fleet.   At present we are confined to the possession of one ship only, the &quot;Argus,&quot; and this ship  is totally inadequate for the carrying of the number of reconnaissance, gunnery and torpedo aeroplanes required  by the sea-going fleets. We  therefore  need  to complete  the  &quot; Eagle&quot; and  &quot; Hermes,&quot; and  to  render the &quot;Furious&quot; capable  of meeting modern requirements in  1921-22, and to convert the &quot; Glorious &quot; into an Aircraft Carrier in the following year.     9. Similarly  as  regards  Minelayers, the sea-going  Fleet is without a modern Minelayer, and we require to  gain experience in the type of vessel, and  the special fittings necessary to carry out  this important operation  of modern naval strategy, an operation which, so far as can  be foreseen, is likely to  increase rather than decrease in importance.  The commencement of one experimental Minelayer 1921-22 is necessary.     10.  Further Dock accommodation will be required for  the four big ships when they are ready, and  it  is  thought  that this  can be  met by the expenditure of a comparatively small  amount on enlarging one  of the surrendered German Floating Docks.     11. The increase in personnel (Vote A) ultimately entailed by the new programme of Capital  Ships will be approximately 1,296.   The number  is based on  the under- standing that old ships will be disposed of  as they are replaced  by the new vessels.The increase entailed by the completion of the partly-built ships and the provision of.the Aircraft Carriers  will be 1,835.    12. Authority is therefore  necessary for a building programme 1921-22 of :          4  Capital Ships.         Completion  of Light Cruisers,  Destroyers and Submarines already  laid down.         Completion  of  &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; and alteration, of &quot;Furious&quot;  as             Aeroplane Carriers.         1  Minelayer.         1  Experimental Submarine.         Enlargement of German Floating Dock.                                                                    W. H.  L.    November 22, 1920.
APPENDIX  I.    In  the  tables attached are shown the capital  ships building  and completed in Great  Britain, theUnited  States and Japan.    2. In making use of those tables it is essential to understand that no comparative  estimate of strengthcan be arrived  at on  a basis  of  numbers alone.   To arrive at such comparative strength the following considerations must be given full weight:     (a)  War lessons have enabled ships designed  since the  Battle of Jutland to  outclass those designed           previous to that action.    (b)  The general fighting capacity of  Capital Ships designed at the same period and to meet the same           requirements  varies directly  as the  displacement,  assuming  national designing  talent  and           knowledge to be equal.    (c)  Provided protection is efficient, offensive righting power in action is proportional to the size of gun,,           assuming a sufficient number is carried.    (d)  Full weight must be given to the endurance factor, which becomes of the first importance  under           Atlantic and Pacific Ocean conditions, where the distances involved are great as compared with           those in the North Sea.    3.  Ships shown in the tables have therefore been divided into four Classes :          Class A. Post-Jutland design over 40,000 tons.         Class B. Post and pre-Jutland design of approximately 30,000 tons.  Armament 14&quot; and above.         Class C. Pre-Jutland design about 25,000 tons.  Armament 13*5&quot; and 14&quot;.         Class D. Pre-Jutlaud design about 21,000 tons.  Armament 12&quot; and 13*5&quot;.    For the purposes of  paper comparison  vessels shown  in the particular classes may  be generallyconsidered as approximately of equal fighting value.     4.  In three or four years&apos; time all  ships in Class D. must  be considered obsolete.   The main reason forthis is that their protection is entirely inadequate, and their magazines are hopelessly exposed to the gunfirethey  would have to meet.                                                     .......     In four  years&apos; time therefore  the position would be, assuming no British building programme                                                        Great Britain.  United States.     Japan.             Class A  --------   1             12            8f             Class B  --------  13             11            4             Class C  --------   4               4            4and the United States would be very greatly superior in Naval Strength.    5. If, however,  in the  years  1921-22  and  1922-23 we carry out the  building programme  proposed,the net effect in 1925 will be as follows :                                                       Great Britain.  United  States.    Japan.             Class A.-     -......9              12            8f             Class B.  ---------   13           .11            4             Class C.  -     -     -   &apos; -    -&apos;   -  .-  . 4-              4  &apos;    .L    4and assuming certain advantage  to ourselves  in  later design and increased experience, although in actualnumbers inferior, an approximate One-Power Standard will have been maintained, with the important proviso that the United States  do not commence any further programme.    6. Such a building programme represents ihe bare minimum  for  a One-Power Standard.  In fact, itactually falls short of such standard in that during the building period about 1923-1925, and before our new ships are completed, Great Britain will be inferior in  fighting strength to the United States.* Note.-Money for 8 others, to be completed in 1928, already provided in addition.a  [18.10.20]  (33) AS 8497-7 (AS 8424 12)  Pk 3610A  75  11/20  E&amp;S
