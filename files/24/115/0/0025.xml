PART   L-THE   LABOUR   SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The week under review has been notable, from the point of view of the general public,as containing the second anniversary of the Armistice.  Attention has been concentratedto a considerable extent upon the ceremonies that have taken place in connection with thatanniversary ; and consequently there are no new developments of importance to report withregard to the labour situation.    Apart altogether from what may be described as the more permanent effects of the coal strike, in reducing reserves of coal, and in affecting foreign commerce, many trades are stillsuffering  from  its immediate results,  in the unemployment or reduced  employment  oflarge  numbers  of workpeople.  The resumption of work in the coal mines, however, hasbeen attended  by remarkably little friction, and the only industrial trouble arising outof the strike,  in the  other occupations affected, has been  among tramway workers  inLancashire and the Potteries.  Here  the trouble  has arisen out  of the  question of the reinstatement of the guaranteed 48-hour week.*  Similar trouble on the railways has beenobviated by the fact that the guaranteed week was not suspended.    In the commercial transport industry, the position in the West Riding of Yorkshireis much clearer, but in some other centres a crisis is approaching.    The most important event of the near future is perhaps the full Congress of the  Inter-national Federation of Trade Unions, which is to meet in London on the 22nd November.This Congress is of interest for two reasons.  The choice of London as the meeting placeis an event of some significance, in view of the fact that the English trade union movement,as a whole, has shown itself in the last year somewhat indifferent to the policy and aspirations of the officials at  the headquarters of the Federation, particularly with regard to the boycott of Hungary.  Secondly, the agenda before  the Congress is ambitious, and dealswith  practical international  problems of  considerable  difficulty,  and   of   supreme importance.    The   Congress will  therefore afford  some test as to  the  value of theInternational Federation as an effective organisation of workers.  A  third matter is  ofsome  interest,  namely, the question at issue between the Trades Union Congress and theGeneral Federation of Trade  Unions, as to the claim of the former to the  sole right of representing the English trade union movement on the  international body.    There are indications that the attention of the Labour movement is again being drawn to the situation in Ireland and the question of trade with Russia.The Unemployment Position.    The  number of  H.M. Forces and rnerchant  seamen out-of-work donation policiescurrent for the United Kingdom, for the week ending the  5th November,  was 290,103,made up of 289,180 lodged by men and 923 by women ;  on the 28th October there were263,232 policies current, 262,369 for men and 863 for women.    On the 5th November, 223,568 unemployment books, 157,676 for males, and  65,892for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Compared withthe previous week,  when there were 141,962 books&quot; lodged by males, and 58,543 by females,the total increase is 23,063.  A detailed analysis of the unemployment  position will  befound on page  593 j                                             . ,    * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 20, 13th November, p. 557.    Erratum. On p. 552 of this Report, No. 20, for lines 11 to 14 read: &quot; An important agreement has been arrived at as to the position of railway shopmen.

57920.11.20FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK. General Topics.     Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The Executive Council of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain held a meeting on the 11th November, to consider the question of unem- ployment insurance, in preparation for a joint meeting with  representatives of the Mining Association of Great Britain on the following day.  At the joint meeting the application of the Act to the  mining industry was discussed.  The representatives both of the coal- owners and of the men were agreed that it was advisable for the industry itself to undertake the responsibility  for dealing with its own unemployment,  instead of coming within  the national scheme, the contention being that the incidence  of unemployment in the mining industry was exceptionally small.   The conference accordingly appointed a committee of six, three  representing the employers and three the Federation, to prepare a special scheme for submission to a future conference.    In the Railway Review  for the  12th November there appears a copy of the  circular issued to the branches explaining the position of railwaymen under the Act,* and giving an account of the procedure followed by the Executive  Council since the Bill was first introduced.  This  is intended to clear up the misunderstanding caused by a circular on  the subject recently issued by the Eailway Clerks&apos; Association, in which there was an implication that the National Union of Railwaymen had been negligent in the matter.    At a  meeting  of the Plymouth  branch of the National Amalgamated Union  of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, the following resolution was passed :            &quot; That this meeting strongly urges the Government to grant donation benefit of 15s.  per week       for men and 12s. per week for women, for a reasonable period, to those workers who are unfortunate       enough to be unemployed from the 8th November to the 6th December next, and so are unable to       secure benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act.&quot;    Agriculture Bill. Protests  are being made both by  the  workers&apos; and the  farmers&apos; organisations against the new clause added to the Agriculture Bill in the House of Commons on the 2nd November, by which provision is made for  the establishment of a separate Agricultural Wages Board for Wales.   The substance of the  objection is that, if  the amendment is embodied in the Act, the work of both employers and workers to bring about greater cohesion and consolidation in the industry will be  destroyed.   Petitions have been presented to the Minister of  Agriculture and to members of Parliament.    Women,  Young Persons  and Children (Employment) Bill. Particulars of a resolution protesting against  the reintroduction into the Bill of Clause 2, relative to the employment of women on the two day-shift system, passed  at a recent delegate conference  of  the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association, appear on page  582 below.    Relief of Unemployment. There is not much change  in the situation with regard to unemployment.  A further meeting of London  members  of Parliament was held, on  the 9th November, to  consider the position in London.  The Minister attended, both in  his capacity of Minister of Labour and as member for Camberwell.  The situation was dis- cussed, and it was agreed to hold similar meetings every fortnight.    At the meeting of the London County Council on the 9th November, schemes for the construction of arterial roads were submitted by the Improvements Committee,  and the Special Committee on Unemployment, and were approved.    A ballot of the members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in Coventry is being taken on the question of working short time to relieve unemployment.  It is expected that the result will be known this week, and a meeting of the district committee will be summoned to consider the matter and issue instructions.    *    Building Guilds. The London Building Guild, Ltd., have secured a  second contract, to build 200 houses for the Greenwich Borough Council.  They are already at work on their first undertaking, the  building of 400 houses for the Walthamstow District Council.  The Glasgow Corporation have agreed that, subject to the  approval  of the Scottish Board ofHealth, the housing scheme  at  Drumoyne,  comprising 264  houses, shall be  carried outby the Glasgow and West of  Scotland Building Guild.                * See this Report, Vol II, No. 20,13th November, p. 553.(B 16645)                                                            4 E 2
    Industrial Court:  General Considerations governing  Decisions. Attention may bedrawn to the terms of a recent award* of the Industrial Court, in which the Court indicate their  views on the question as to how far at the present time wages increases may be governed by reference to the fluctuations in the cost of living.  In this case, the representa-tives  of the workpeople had submitted that a further advance was due on account of thecontinued rise in the  cost of living, and  also on account of the increased productivity ofthe industry; while, on the other side, it was represented to the Court, though no document-tary evidence was produced, that the present condition and outlook of the trade was such that  any advance in  wages would have a  prejudicial  effect on employment,  the firms concerned being short of new orders, and in some cases having adopted short time.     In the opinion of the Court, the increase in the cost of living, which had taken place inthis instance since the date of the last advance in wages, justified the submission of a claim for a  further advance.  On  the other hand,  the  Court thought that it was  incumbentupon them to consider whether a claim submitted on such grounds was completely met by the statements made respecting the condition of the trade.     The Court understood the position  at the present  time generally to be that, whilst the abnormal activity of trade due directly to the war was becoming less, and whilst therewas a consequent tendency for wholesale prices to fall, retail prices were not yet affectedto any marked extent, and the cost of living showed no sign of immediate or early diminution-tion.   &apos;&apos; This disparity between the course of wholesale prices and the cost of living indicates &quot; that the connection between rates of wages and the cost of living is not so close or direct &quot; as is frequently contended, and that the present high cost of living cannot be  attributed &quot; wholly, or even mainly, to the present level of wages.&quot;     The Court were of the opinion that during the war, when competition both at home and abroad was of considerably less importance than at the present time, there were grounds for urging that changes in the cost of living, brought about largely by the financial policy of this and other countries,  should be followed step by  step by corresponding changes in wages. At the present time, however, it appeared to the Court to be clear that&quot; the task &quot; of restoring stable conditions of industry would be impeded, if not made impossible, if &quot; every advance in the cost of living was to be accompanied in competitive industries by&quot; a corresponding or proportionate increase in wages; such a policy might well prevent the&quot; necessary adjustment of cost of production to the new conditions of demand, and result in&quot; dislocation under which  the workers themselves would suffer through short time and&apos;&apos; unemployment.&apos;&apos;     The conclusion of the Court, therefore, was that, in the present time  of transition,some compromise was necessary between the mechanical regulation of wages on the basisof the cost of living,  and the regulation of  wages solely by reference to the state of themarket in the particular industry which might be under consideration.  Increases in the cost of living should  be allowed due weight as a factor in the  situation, but it would beagainstlthe interests of the workers and of the whole community that claims for increasesinfwages  on these grounds  alone  should be pressed or conceded to the full extent  thatmight be  proper  if normal economic processes had not again begun to operate.  Thedecision of the Court  on the particular case in  question was arrived at having regard both to thejgeneral considerations thus stated, and to the facts submitted at the hearing.    Labour and Russia. Some renewal of activity on the part of local Councils of  action is reported, and it is understood that the National Council are&apos;being pressed to  convene aNational Conference to discuss what policy shall be adopted in view of the Government^delay in making peace with Russia.  There is a strong tendency to connect the trade depression and the  unemployment  consequent upon it with the absence of trade  withRussia.  A general propaganda campaign  throughout the country in  support of  thisview  is also announced.     The Glasgow Council of Action are taking steps to have  an inquiry made into the allegation  that a Renfrew firm have received and  are working on a large contract  for gas shells.  The firm in question have refused to confirm or deny the statement.     Labour and  Ireland. The situation with  regard to the Irish railways  remains  very critical.  The conference of railwaymen summoned by the executive of the  Irish Labour Party and Trades lUnion Congress, and attended by the Irish secretaries of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, was held in Dublin  on the 9th November.   The conference endorsed a resolution adopted previously by the Labour Party executive,  calling for full  support to the  railwaymen, and summoning a  special    * Award No. 521 (Textile Workers, Hillfoots), dated the 8th November, 1920. See also p. 586 below.
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 20, 13th October, p. 554, conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress for the 16th Novembe to discuss the steps which should be taken to meet the future situation.     The British Parliamentary Labour Party also held a meeting on the 9th November to discuss the Irish situation.  It was decided that the Party should move the rejection of the third reading of the Government of Ireland Bill. . The Labour Party are understood to be considering the advisability of appointing a fully representative Labour Commission, to proceed to Ireland and investigate the origin, nature and extent of the alleged &quot; reprisals &quot; policy of the Government. Industrial and Other Organisations.     National Federation  of Building Trades Operatives. No conclusions have yet been reached in the negotiations between the Emergency Committee of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives and the Ministry of Health, on the question of guarantees to permit of the introduction of ex-Service men into the industry.*     The Emergency Committee arranged for a meeting to be held on the 10th November, at the House of Commons,  with the Parliamentary Committee  of the Trades Union Con- gress and the Parliamentary Labour Party, to discuss the Government proposals.   No report of this meeting has been issued.     The executive of the Federation will meet  on the 19 th November, to arrange for the election of a successor to the late Mr. W.  Bradshaw, general secretary  of the Federation, and also to discuss the question of dilution and  other matters.     The National Conciliation  Board for the Building Industry are to meet on the 17th and 18th November, to deal with matters affecting wages and conditions.  -     The executive of the Federation are  asking members for  a mandate vigorously to suppress overtime, except on housing schemes and in cases of extreme urgency.   Voting is fixed to take place next month.     The amalgamation of the  Operative  Bricklayers&apos; Society,  the Manchester  Unity of Operative Bricklayers&apos; Trade, Accident, Sick and Burial Society, and the Operative Society of Stonemasons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades of England and Wales, will shortly be ratified when the  organisers of each union meet the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives to issue instructions to branches as to the procedure to be adopted in the new organisation.  The new union will come into existence on the 1st January.     Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. At a meeting held on the 13th November, the Executive  Council of the South. Wales Miners&apos; Federation accepted the resignations of Mr. W. Brace, M.P., and Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P.;  and it was decided that Mr. James Winstone, agent to the  Eastern Valley,  Monmouthshire, District  of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, should be asked to act as president  of the Federation, and Mr. Enoch Morrell, agent to the TatT and Cynon District, as vice-president, until the annual conference in June, 1921.   .     The vacancies on the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were filled by the appointment of Mr.  T.  Richards, General Secretary of  the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and Mr. Noah Ablett, agent to  tire Merthyr District of this Federation.     The Secretary of Mines announced, on the 12th.  November, that Mr.  Brace  had accepted the post of  Chief Labour Adviser to the Mines Department.  As this involves Mr. Brace&apos;s retirement from his seat in Parliament,  the South Wales miners will meet at once to choose  a successor, whose name will  be  submitted to the  Divisional Labour Party.    An open letter written by Mr.  Frank Hodges, secretary of the  Miners&apos; Federation, to the South Wales miners is published in  the South Wales News of the 11th November. In this letter Mr. Hodges expresses his regret for the resignation of Mr. Vernon Hartshorn from  the executive of the national organisation, and states that his loss will be a  very heavy one.  He speaks very highly of the work done by Mr. Hartshorn, both in Parliament and on the  executive of the Federation, and states that his experience and capacity are most necessary at this juncture, when the Federation are about to engage on the greatest task which  they have yet undertaken.  Mr. Hartshorn has stated that his reason for resigning is a desire to give his critics  a  chance to experiment in  national leadership; and Mr. Hodges  warns the  miners that the  experiment is too dangerous, and ends byexpressing the hope that Mr. Hartshorn will be asked to revoke his decision.    It is stated that Mr. Herbert Smith,  vice-president of the Miners&apos; Federation, and
president of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, also contemplates resignation owing to the criticism of the extremists.     United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association. The special conference called to receivereports from the affiliated organisations on the question of forming a closer federation for political as well as  industrial purposes* was held at  Bury on the 13th November.  Mr.Walter Gee, president of the Association, presided over the meeting, which was attended by 242 delegates.  The proceedings were private, but an official report was issued at the close of the meeting.  In this report it was stated that five of the organisations had decided in favour of the scheme, and four against, and that it had been decided to refer the matter to the next annual  conference  for further  consideration.   This decision was expected in view of the attitude of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton  Spinnersand  Twiners, and the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives,who rejected the scheme by large majorities  at special meetings held during October.     The conference also discussed the question of working hours in the cotton mills.  Theexisting agreement  with the employers for a 48-hour week may be terminated at therequest of either side at the close of the year.   There has been an agitation in some quarters for the introduction of a 44-hour week, which would permit of work being started at 8 a.m.on each working  day, with eight hours a day for the first  five days, and four hours on saturday.   The conference decided to leave this matter in the hands of the LegislativeCouncil.     The delegates were informed  that  efforts to induce the employers  to  co-operate incontracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1920, by providing  a special schemefor the industry as a whole, had failed,  and  it wras agreed that each affiliated organisationbe advised to make an arrangement under Section 17 of the Act for the purpose of payingunemployment benefit to their own members.     In connection with the Women, Young Persons and  Children (Employment) Bill, theconference strongly protested against  the  reintroduction of  the two  day-shift clause, and declared that, if such a  provision became operative, the association  would  do  their utmost to induce members to refuse to take advantage of the Act.   It was recommendedthat local  meetings of textile workers  be held to pass resolutions protesting against theintroduction of the two day-shift system,  which should be forwarded to local  members of Parliament.     A proposal to  extend  the  political work of the association had also been placedon the agenda, but, after  discussion, it  was decided not to proceed with this-matter atpresent.     National  Union of Scientific  Workers. The annual meeting of the Council of theNational  Union of  Scientific Workers was  held on the 13th November.  The president,Dr.  J. W. Evans, F.R.S.,  moved resolutions, which were carried unanimously, that uni-university science courses should include  some training in research  methods, and that the universities should  be as closely associated with research as possible.     A resolution moved   by Professor  Soddy, F.R.S.,  and  carried  unanimously, is worth noting.   The union thereby  expressed their disapproval of &quot; the  policy of the. Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, in  establishing  and financing  research associations, which hands over to  the  private  use  of profit-seeking monopolies valuable knowledge obtained at the expense of the whole community, and places  the associations in a position  to exploit the scientific workers of the country for their own benefit.&quot;     Professor Soddy said that the request  of the War Office that the universities should undertake research work relating to chemical warfare had raised an  issue which the union would have to face, and that a  committee would be set up  to examine it.     Professor L.  Bairstow, Professor of Aero-Dynamics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, was elected president of the union for the coming year.     Co-operative Wholesale Society. A conference, representative  of the  whole of the Southern Section of the Society, was held on the 13th November, when the financial problems of the Society were discussed,  especially  the problem of raising capital for development purposes.   It was  urged that  the Co-operative Bank should  be developed   on Post Office lines, and that friendly societies should be encouraged to invest their money in it.     The co-operative societies began a campaign on  the 10th November, which is to last until the  25th November, with the object  of securing for the  movement a large increase in capital.         * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 201, and No. 19, 6th November, p. 530.
5&amp;320.11.20,Trade Union Topics.    Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation. In the scheme for the reconstruc-tion of this Federation* it is proposed to withdraw the general funds of the affiliated unionsfrom &quot; all concerns of capitalistic origin and control, and to reinvest them in Governmentstock, municipal securities and the co-operative movement.&quot;    National Transport Workers&apos;  Federation. Nineteen  unions  are  now reported to be interested in the amalgamation scheme which will bring all sections of transport workers,from dock labourers to vehicle workers, and  a large body of general workers into one large union, the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union.f  Copies of the scheme have beensent to each district, for the immediate consideration of the  district committee.   Beforeamalgamation can be effected, according to the provisions  of the  Trade Union (Amal-gamation) Act, 1917, at least 50 per cent, of each union must vote, and there  must be amajority of at least 20 per cent, of those voting.    The executive committee of the  Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Coal Trimmers&apos; Unionheld a meeting on the 10th November, when the proposed amalgamation was again con-sidered, and approved with one or two important amendments.   A ballot of the membersis to be taken.  The provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, were discussed ;and letters from the Minister of Labour were read, stating that  coal trimmers could notbe excluded.   A scheme under Section 18 of the Act is to be prepared in conjunction withthe employers, and is to be submitted to a future meeting of the  committee.    National Union of Textile Workers. It is reported that considerable progress hasbeen made with the  scheme set on foot by the General Union of Textile Workers for the amalgamation of the union and four other societies in the West Eiding of Yorkshire inone organisation, to  be known as the National Union of  Textile  Workers.  The scheme,which was outlined by Mr. Ben Turner at the half-yearly  delegate meeting of the GeneralUnion on the 28th August, provides for the future admission of numerous smaller societieswhich exist in various branches of the Yorkshire woollen textile industry, and it is believedthat many of these would be prepared to merge themselves immediately in the new union.The ultimate aim is the inclusion in one union of all the organisations in  the  various branches of the  woollen textile industry at present federated in the National Associationof Unions in the Textile Trades.   The proposed union will therefore cover the dyeing andfinishing as well as the spinning and manufacturing sections.    Scottish Council of Textile Trade  Unions. The Scottish  textile trade unions, which include workers in  the cotton,  the  woollen and worsted and other textile  trades,are also promoting  an amalgamation scheme.  The  Scottish Council of Textile  TradeUnions have 17 affiliated societies, and moreover several of the English textile unions havea considerable membership in Scotland.  A proposal to amalgamate the 17 associations,at present loosely linked together in the Council of Textile Trade Unions, has been approved,and it has also been suggested that, if the Yorkshire unions  succeed.in carrying through their  amalgamation  proposals,  the  Scottish amalgamation should eventually  become a party to the larger scheme.    Amalgamated Union, of Co-operative and commercial Employees and Allied Workers. On the 14th and 15th November, a conference  was held to draw up a constitution for thenew body created by the fusion of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and CommercialEmployees and Allied Workers and the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union.It was decided that its title should be the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.The first president is Mr. J. Jagger,  who was president of the  Amalgamated Union.  the amalgamation will take effect as from the 1st January, 1921.Ex-Service  Men.    National Federation of Discharged and Disabled Sailws and Soldiers. A special delegate conference was held at Leicester on the 6th November, to discuss a recommendation of theCouncil in favour of the draft scheme for the amalgamation of ex-Service men&apos;s organisa-tions.   The conference was attended by about 200 delegates.   On the motion of the presi-dent, Mr. Lister, a resolution was adopted in favour of a united organisation on democraticand independent lines.  A dinner was held in the evening, at which Field-Marshal EarlHaig addressed the delegates.                     * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 434.                     f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October,  p. 483.
NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.    Engineering and Shipbuilding Operatives (National). In connection with the nationalclaim already reported,* negotiations between the Engineering and the National Employers&apos;Federations and the Amalgamated Engineering Union were resumed at York on the 10thNovember, and between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the unions concerned on the  12th November, in London.    Commercial Road Transport Workers (Various Areas).,f Manchester members of theUnited Eoad Transport Workers&apos; Association, on the 14th November, decided to act independently of the other two unions concerned, and to meet the local employers separatelyon their wages demand.   At Bristol, the transport workers have decided to strike on the20th November failing acceptance of their demands.  The Bradford  carters returned towork on  the  15th November, on the increases given under the West Riding settlementof the 5th, but only pending further negotiations  between the Lord Mayors of  Bradfordand Leeds and representatives  of both parties concerned.    Tramwaymen (Ashton-under-Lyne). Ashton-under-Lyne  tramway  men struck  onthe 13th November, for payment for loss of time under the guaranteed week, from the dateof the  termination of the coal  strike.   Work was resumed on  the  following day,  onunderstanding that the claim should be  referred to the National Industrial Council forthe Tramways Industry,  and that, failing a satisfactory conclusion  within seven days,the authorities concerned should undertake to settle the matter themselves.    Insurance Officials (Royal London  Mutual Assurance  Society).-The National Amal-gamated  Union of Life Assurance Workers have handed in strike notices, to expire on the25th November,  on behalf of their members employed as agents by  the Royal LondonMutual Assurance Society,  in consequence of the delay in the consideration of a wagesclam.    Theatrical Employees (London). After three  days&apos; negotiations between  the society of West  End Theatre Managers and the National Association of Theatrical Employees,it was mutually agreed on the 15th November to refer the demands of  the latter organisa-tions, on  behalf of their London members, to the Conciliation Board of the Joint IndustrialCouncil for the Entertainments Industry.fStrikes and Lock-Outs.    Tramwaymen (Edinburgh).- In consequence of a number of  dismissals, Edinburghtramwaymen, from the 8th November, decided to enforce the &quot; no  standing &quot; regulation.The Corporation threatened, however, that if the  embargo on the carriage of excess pas-passengers was not withdrawn by the 11th November, they would retire from the national industrial Council for the Tramway Industry.  The Corporation, on the 15th, endeavoured to enforce their orders by the dismissal of men who refused to obey.   This action was thesignal for a strike, which began on the same date.Settlements and Agreements.    Coal Miners (National).

The draft constitution forthe proposed amalgamation of ex-Service men&apos;s organisations  was considered, and  anumber of alterations recommended, at a special conference of the East Anglian DivisionalAssociation on the 7th November.  A communication from the Newmarket and Districtbranch stated that they would have nothing to do with amalgamation.  It was decidedto urge them to reconsider this attitude, and, at the suggestion  of the chairman, it was further decided that a visit be paid to the branch in reference to the matter.
Negotiations  and Disputes-continued.    Shale Oil Workers (National). An agreement has been negotiated between ScottishOils, Ltd., and the various unions representing the men employed in the industry, by whichall employees are to receive the same advance as that granted to the miners.    Colliery Clerical Staffs  (South Wales). The Monmouthshire and  South  Wales CoalOwners&apos; Association have decided to give  the colliery  clerical stalls in South Wales an equivalent wage advance to that granted to the coal miners under the recent settlement.    Commercial Road Transport Workeis (Skipton). A settlement has  now been reachedcovering the Skipton district, where work was resumed on the 11th November, at the oldrate of pay, conditional upon  the employers&apos; recognition of the new West Riding scaleas from the 15th November.    Tramwaymen (Various Areas). The  men employed by the Potteries Electric TractionCompany  resumed work on the 13th November, on the understanding that the working ofa guaranteed 48-hour week should be restored,  and that  no discharges should take place before the 26th November, by which time the unions concerned estimate that services willbe normal.    In reply to the Burnley tramwaymen&apos;s demand for  the immediate reinstatement ofthe guaranteed 48-hour week from the 4th  November, the Tramway Committee offered a compromise, which was accepted by the  men on the 13th November.    At Bury the Tramway Committee replied to the demand for time-and-a-half for allhours worked  on the reduced service, by  an offer of time-and-a-half for heavy loads,amounting to 5 hours a day.  This was accepted by the tramwaymen,  providing that thewhole of the money is pooled and equally divided among the men affected.

PART   IL-THE   WORK   OF   THE  MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL   RELATIONS  DEPARTMENT.                 ARBITRATION  AND CONCILIATION.                                  AWARDS.    The number of awards received during the week was 15, of which 12 were under theIndustrial Courts Act, one under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, as amended bythe Industrial Courts Act, and two given by single arbitrators.    Textile Workers (Hillfoots). The Court, in granting advances of 3s. and 2s. to men andwomen time-workers concerned,  and  corresponding  advances  to piece-workers,  gavereasoned opinions with regard to the relations between the cost of living, the state of themarket in a particular industry, and wages in the industry.*  (Award No. 521.)    Admiralty N on-Industrial Establishments. As a result of two claims, one by the ScottishHorse and Motormen&apos;s Association, and the other by the Workers&apos; Union and the NationalUnion of  General Workers, the Court awarded advances of 5s. per week to the workers concerned, who  were not engaged in the engineering or shipbuilding or allied trades.(Awards Nos. 524 and 525.)    Electricity Workers (Colchester). The Court held  that it was  nob necessary to dealwith the question whether or not the Corporation were  bound by the decisions of the joint industrial Council, and that it was sufficient for the purpose of the present decision thatthe rates claimed were being paid generally throughout the area.  The rates set out in theclaim should be paid ; half the amount of the advances  due in respect of each workershould take effect as from the 1st  May, 1920, and the remainder as  from the 1st January,1921.   (Award No. 526.)                      AGREEMENTS AND  SETTLEMENTS.    Bone Cutters (Sheffield). In July, 1920, the Workers&apos; Union submitted a demand for increases in wages to time-workers from Is. 6hd. to 2s. id. an hour, and to piece-workers of 33-g- per cent, on an hourly basic rate of Is. Id.    Negotiations between the  Sheffield Bone Cutters&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Unionensued, with the assistance of the departments local Conciliation Officer, who was, how-ever, unable to prevent a strike on the 30th July. Finally, as a result of meetings arranged by the Conciliation Officer, an agreement was reached, which provided for an advance totime-workers and piece-workers of 20 per cent, on their present-earnings, in which was tobe merged a bonus  of 7s. per week previously granted.   Work was resumed on the 4thSeptember.    In October the  piece-workers brought  certain grievances forward, and it became apparent that the settlement, by which many time-workers had received an advance of id.an hour,  had upset  the ratio between time-workers&apos;  and piece-workers&apos; earnings.  Thepiece-workers accordingly claimed, in addition to a further 2\ per cent, which was granted,a further increase of 12f per cent, to restore the balance.  As a  result of negotiationsconducted by the Conciliation Officer, this advance was  granted as from the 4th September,or any later date on which work was resumed.   The piece-workers thus receive an advanceof 35 per cent.    Pottery Workers (Torquay). Work was resumed  at the Water combe  and AllervalePotteries  on the 4th November.  The  settlement, which was  reached by negotiation between the employers and the men direct, the union being ignored, provides for an increaseof 20 per cent., on condition that  piece-work shall be worked.  The guaranteed minimum rate is fixed at Is. 8d. per hour.  Day workers receive an advance of from Id. to 2d. an hour, making their rate Is. 5d. The lock-out at the works of the Longpark and TorquayCo. has been withdrawn.* See p. 580 above.

Dyers and Finishers (Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire). On the 10th November a deputation of the employers, headed by Sir Thomas Robinson, M.P., met Sir David Shackleton,  and a general discussion on the present  position of the wages claim ensued.   The chief point at issue in which the Ministry  are concerned still  appears to be the  form which arbitration proceedings shall take.   The employers  stipulate that the proceedings must be of a general character, covering the whole of the industry, while the unions demand the reverse.  The  employers wish the matter to  be dealt  with  by the Ministry under the Industrial Courts Act.  Up to the present the unions will not acquiesce in this.     The deputation stated that,  if it was thought that they should adopt some procedure other than that which they  had  been ready to accept, they wished to be advised in that sense by the Ministry.  Sir David Shackleton replied that he would prefer first to see the unions again, and make further efforts to get them to agree to his previous proposals regard- ing the selection of a chairman to preside at the arbitration proceedings.     Arrangements have now been made for a deputation of representatives of the unions to meet  the Chief  Labour Adviser on the 16th November.   In the meantime, the strike notices given  to the Yorkshire Dyers&apos; Federation by- the National  Society of Dyers  and Finishers, which were due to expire on the 13th November, will probably not be put into effect, and no strike is likely to take place before the interview.                   QUESTIONS PENDING  AND MISCELLANEOUS.     Woollen Workers (Scotland). The three  unions party  to Awards Nos.  403 and 404, relying on the clauses which provide that, in the event of unforeseen circumstances arising, the question of whether the rates  of wages fixed by those awards should be varied might be re-opened forthwith, made application to the employers for advances in wages on account of the unforeseen rise in the cost  of living. *  The employers refused to consider the claims, stating that the ground on which they were made was inadequate, nor would they agree to a joint reference to arbitration, as they considered this  would prejudice their attitude&apos;that no revision was necessary.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, has been in touch with the parties with a view to finding some way out of the difficulty.     The  Scottish Woollen and Worsted Joint Industrial Council held a special meeting, on the 11th  November, at which some misapprehensions regarding the attitude of the Ministry and the Industrial Court were cleared away, and it was agreed that the parties should meet in joint conference at an early date.     Insurance Officials. The strike of members of the Guild oi Insurance Officials employed by the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., continues.  It is not yet known how far the business of the company is affected, or whether the strike has caused an alteration in their attitude towards recognition.  The Guild claim that  about half of the company&apos;s employees are out, and have again sought the assistance of the department.                         INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS.

Following a preliminary conference on the 14th October, a drafting committee met on the 4th November, and prepared a draft constitution for circulation to constituent bodies. Reports.    Bobbin and Shuttle Making-The Council met on the 8th November to resume the discussion of the application for  advances in wages, consideration  of which had resultedin a  deadlock at the previous meeting on the 26th October.  An agreement was reachedto the effect that the wages ,of higher skilled workers be advanced by 5s. per week as fromthe next  ensuing pay-day, and by a  further 5s. per week on the first pay-day in January, 1921 ; those of less  skilled workers by 3s. 6d. and 4s., respectively ; those of labourers by
3s. and 3s., with a further advance of Is. Qd. on the first pay-day in April, 1921.   The wages of women workers are to be advanced in December, if the  cost-of-living index number is higher than 157 per cent.   All wages are to be reviewed in March, 1921, on the publicationof the Labour Gazette index number, with a view to a further increase, as from the; firstpay-day in April, if the cost of living  shows an increase over the December figure.  Theagreement is to be binding until the 30th June, 1921.    Building. The Resettlement Committee have  received a letter from the NationalFederation of Building Trades Employers  of Great  Britain and Ireland, referring to the circular recently issued by the Committee regarding the augmentation of labour for housing and the wet-time proposals.  The Federation state  that, at a representative meeting, itwas resolved unanimously that after  careful consideration of the Government wet-timeproposals, they are strongly opposed to them as detrimental  and costly, and they propose to protest to the Cabinet Committee against the Government^  decisions.   They  offer toco-operate with the operatives in reconsidering the matter.    Cement. The Council  met on the 4th  November.  The draft  working rules were considered, and  a drafting  committee was appointed to  review them further.  It  wasdecided that time-and-a-quarter should be paid to  shift-workers for ordinary shift-time between midnight on  Sunday and  6 a.m.  on Monday.   Retrospective payment is to bemade under this decision.    Electricity Supply. The District  Council for the South Coast area met on the 12thNovember.  The decision of the National Council as to the date of operation of the sche-dules of wages was reported and approved, and the schedules are to be circulated forthwith.The Council were in entire agreement with the suggestion of the National Council that aconference of representatives of each District Council and the National Council should beheld.    A special meeting of the National  Joint Board of Employers and  Staff Members  washeld on the 13th November, to consider the situation arising from the  notice given  bythe Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association that their members would be withdrawn on the30th November,  unless all undertakings had agreed, by the 27th, to put into operation theschedules  of pay and conditions agreed to by the Board.  At the request of the employers&apos;side, the Association agreed to postpone the operation of the notices for a fortnight, onthe assurance that the employers&apos; side  would, in the meantime, use their influence with the undertakings which have not yet adopted the schedules referred to.    A further conference between representatives of the National Joint Council for LocalAuthorities&apos;  Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales) and ofthe National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members (Electricity Supply Industry)was held on the 12th November, when the  consideration  was resumed of the overlappingof the interests of  the two bodies in questions  affecting the staffs of  municipal electricity supply undertakings.   The conference agreed to recommend that two representatives ofthe National Joint Council should be appointed to the National Joint Board, and vice versa,in order to ensure that matters of common interest be communicated to both bodies, andwith the object of arriving at joint decisions as to the rates and conditions of service formunicipal staff employees.    Flour Milling. A deputation from the Council waited upon the Chief Labour adviser on the 9th November, to put before him their resolution on the composition of the industrial court, when cases of non-federated firms  are being heard.  The Council suggested  thaton such occasions two members of the Industrial Council  should be added to the Court.The Chief Labour Adviser was unable  to agree to this suggestion, but thought it might bepossible for  the  Court to have two  members of the Industrial Council as assessors whencases affecting the industry  were heard.  He was, however, unable to give any pledge inthis matter, as it was one of general policy on which the Minister would have to be consulted.The deputation expressed satisfaction with this suggestion which, they thought, if generallyput into practice, would greatly strengthen the position of all Industrial Councils.    Glass. The first meetings of the  Bottles and Jars and the Domestic, Fancyware andIlluminating Sectional Councils were held on the 10th November.  Important amendments were  made to the constitutions previously adopted, and these were accepted by  the con-stituent associations, with the exception of the English  and Scottish Glass Bottle Manu-facturers.   Both  Councils decided to  take no  action with regard to the UnemploymentInsurance Act.    The National Council met later on the same day.   The constitutions of the SectionalCouncils as amended were ratified.  It was decided to take  no special action as an industry

General Department-continued.Board  for certain classes  of male  workers,  and has specified the 15th November as thedate from which these rates shall become effectived            The overtime rates are, for the first two hours of overtime on any day except Saturday, Sunday        and customary public  and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter; for overtime after the first two        hours on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, and for all overtime        on the weekly short day, time-and-a-half; and for all time worked on Sunday and customary public        and statutory holidays, double-time.  For all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-        quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable under the above provisions.  For the        purpose of these  overtime rates  the Board  have declared the normal number of  hours of work to        be 48 in any week, 9 on any week-day other than Saturday or the weekly short day, and 5 on the        weekly short day. Where it is  the established practice of an  employer  to require attendance on        Sunday instead of Saturday the  overtime rates described above apply as if the words &quot; Saturday &quot;        and &quot; Sunday &quot; had been interchanged.     Hair, Bass and Fibre Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has  made an Orderdated the 10th November, confirming minimum rates of wages for male and female workers as varied and fixed by the Board,  and has specified the loth November as the date fromwhich these rates shall become effective.            The general minimum time-rates as fixed and varied for male and female workers, except hand-        loom weavers other than damask-seating hand-loom weavers, have already been indicated.!            General minimum piece-rates have been fixed for hand-loom weavers, other than damask-seating        hand-loom weavers, for haircloth and for plain hair-seating weaving.            The overtime rates as varied for time-workers are, for the first four  hours of overtime in any        week, time-and-a-quarter ; after the first four hours,  time-and-a-half;  for all time worked on Sunday        and  customary public and statutory holidays, double time.  For piece-workers  the rates are, in        respect of each hour of overtime, a piece-rate which would yield in the circumstances of the case, to an        ordinary worker,  at least the equivalent of the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate  or general        minimum time-rate, as the case may be,  with the addition, respectively, of a sum equivalent to one-        quarter, one-half  or the whole of the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate or  general minimum        time-rate, as the case may be, in respect of each of the first four hours&apos; overtime in any week, or each        hour subsequently, or each hour of employment on  Sunday,  or  on customary public and statutory        holidays.            These overtime rates do not apply to hand-loom weavers other than damask-seating hand-loom        weavers, for whom, except in the case of homeworkers employed on piece-work, the rates are as follows :        in addition to not less than the appropriate general minimum piece-rates, for the first four hours&apos;        overtime in any week,  2d. per hour ; after the first four hours, id. per hour  ; for each hour of employ-        ment on Sunday or customary public and statutory holidays, 8d. per hour.            For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours        of work to be 48  in any week.     Machine-made Lace and Net Finishing Trade Board. The Board have issued a Noticeof Proposal,  dated the 8th  November,  to vary the minimum rates of wages at presenteffective, the period of operation of which expires on the 1st February, 1921, by continuingthem in  operation as  from the 2nd February, subject to  the undermentioned  variations;and to fix general minimum piece-rates  for cutting, and for cutting and scalloping lace,other than  cross-band lace.            An increase of 8 per cent., or Id. in the shilling, is proposed in the general minimum piece-rates        for drawing, roving, and ripping and roving ; for clipping other than frame clipping, scalloping, or        cutting and scalloping, or ripping and scalloping ; for cutting;  and for straight snicking or slotting        in the case of lace other than warp lace ;  for drawing and plain cutting in the case of lace produced on        warp machines ; and for threading and carding hair nets, whether produced on plain net machines or        not.            The Board also propose to vary the general minimum time-rates, for workers other than learners,        from Id. to l\d. per hour.* See this Report, Vol. IIKNO. 6, 7th August, p. 225.f^See this Report, Vol. II, No. 10, 4th September,^. 328.
EMPLOYMENT  AND  INSURANCE  DEPARTMENT.                           EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.     Owing to the strike in the coal mining industry the usual figures of registrations,placings and vacancies are not available.     For statistical information  as to payments of out-of-work donation and unemploy-ment insurance benefit, see p. 578 above.Men&apos;s Employment.     General Industrial Situation. Reports  indicate that the effects  of  the  coal strikeare being rapidly dissipated, but  that, in those industries which were depressed beforethe coal dispute, the conditions remain on the whole unaltered.     Local Reports. In the London and South-Eastern Division, Berniondsey, Shoreditch,Stepney and Woolwich report that the unemployment position is unchanged.  At Woolwich,125  men  have been absorbed on the arterial road  scheme.  Unemployment tends toincrease in Deptford, Hackney  and Poplar.  At Deptford several firms  are consideringthe  application of short-time arrangements.  The number  of men on the Poplar live register is approximately 3,000, the bulk of whom are of unskilled labouring types, for whom there is no prospect of absorption.     The  situation at Canning Town  has improved.   Workpeople discharged owing tothe strike are being re-engaged and the outlook for the immediate  future  is hopeful.While the recent rate of increase on the live register at Enfield has not been maintained,the unemployment problem remains somewhat  acute.  The  position  at  Hendon is lessacute than in recent weeks.  The Aircraft  Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,  have reinstated anumber of their discharged workpeople,  but the re-engagement of all those previouslyemployed is not immediately  anticipated.  The position  at Camberwell is  serious;supplies of cement are still inadequate.     Unemployment in the South Midlands and Eastern Division was  aggravated by therecent strike, the effects of which, however,  are now  rapidly diminishing.  factories which adopted short-time arrangements have, in most cases, now resumed normal working.Certain blastfurnaces still remain damped down, and ironstone quarries connected therewithare not yet working in all cases.     Depression continues  in  the  boot and  shoe, wholesale  clothing, elastic web andstraw industries, and there is little prospect of improvement.  There has  been a continuanceof the improvement  reported in the leather  industry as regards the  poorer qualities ofleather.  Increased activity in the hosiery trade is looked for towards Christmas.     The  South-Western Division  report  that the situation in the Basingstoke area hasbecome serious.  Some 600 of the present applicants for benefit have been discharged by messrs. J. I. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd.,  engineers.  There is, as yet, no  special  scheme forthe alleviation of unemployment.   The position is unchanged  in the Bournemouth area,but the arterial road scheme will, it is hoped, improve matters considerably  as  soon asoperations are commenced.  The scheme for the extension of the esplanade at Ports nouthis now in operation,  and 100 men have  been placed by the Exchange.   Work has been commenced  on the lay-out of the housing  scheme at Weymouth, some&apos; 50  men being employed.  It is expected that  a  further 100 men will shortly be engaged on the ship-breaking scheme at Plymouth, and the Corporation have undertaken a road scheme uponwhich 400 men will ultimately be employed.     In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division the settlement of  the dispute in thetransport industry at Leeds, Bradford,  and other centres, has considerably relieved thesituation in the West Riding.  In few instances, however, will the resumption  of businesssucceeding the  coal settlement bring  prosperity to industries which  had been sufferingfrom depression.  On the contrary, the position of a  number of industries appears to bemore serious.  The Kirkstall Forge Co., Leeds, who discharged  half their workpeople,give no hope of reinstatement before  January.  Business is still very slack in the ship-building yards at Grimsby, Hull and Selby, where the cancellation of orders, owing to thehigh cost of production, is stated to be the main causes of depression.  Short-time arrange-ments are still in general operation throughout the woollen and worsted textile industries,and  improvement is not looked for before January.   The textile finishing trades are alsoslack.  There is still much unemployment in the wholesale clothing trade, and in the bootand  shoe industry.   The lace and hosiery trades also are still slack.           ditoi-jJnji(B 16645)4 a
    The North-Western Division report that at Liverpool and Garston the unemploymentposition is less pronounced, and the effects of the coal strike are daily disappearing.   Thecotton warehousing trade is still unusually dull for this  season of the year,  but showssome  sign of improvement.  There has been an unfortunate hitch in the negotiations fora settlement of  the shipwrights&apos;  dispute,  but  constant efforts are  being made to bringabout a resumption of work.  There has been a considerable reduction in the unemployment figures at Birkenhead and Wallasey, mainly owing to an increased demand for labour atthe shipyards.   There has been rather more unemployment at Blackburn among cottonoperatives ;  43 mills are wholly and 16 partially closed down.  At Preston the depressionin the cotton trade has become more acute;  28 mills are now closed  or on  short-time working.  The position at Salford is unaltered, but at Chorley, Burnley and Darwen theposition appears to be improving. At Burnley, full-time working  has  been resumed inthe engineering works, and in a majority of the cotton mills.  The situation at Openshaw isstill serious  owing to the depression in the engineering and motor industries.    In the Wales Division the effects of the strike are rapidly disappearing.   All collieriesare now working, and there is every indication that industries affected by the coal shortagewill shortly  be fully employed.   At Swansea several establishments for the  manufactureof patent fuel have resumed working.  A gradual improvement is shown in the shipment of general cargoes, and, with the  re-opening of the fuel  works, additional  employment will be provided at the docks.1  There has been a  temporary scarcity of steel bars for tinplatemanufacture, but with the return of full activity in the trade the  shortage will be met.A partial resumption  is looked for at Llanelly, where the industry is at  present mostaffected.    In Scotland the iron and steel  industry  is  making rapid strides towards  normalconditions.   Generally speaking,  with  the exception of the blastfurnaces, firms compelledto suspend workpeople will resume normal working conditions during the next fortnight.    The  position in the flax  and jute industries at Arbroath and Brechin is becomingworse.  Short-time arrangements are in operation there, and are likely to be adopted atForfar, Montrose and Kirriemuir.  The  motor  industry is in a precarious position,  andit is feared that Messrs. Arrol-Johnston, Ltd.,  Dumfries, may have to close down.   the woollen and hosiery factories in the Galashiels district  are still working short time, but ifadequate supplies of  fuel are obtainable  full-time  working may be resumed.   Messrs.Paton &amp; Baldwins, Alloa, have resumed their normal working week in most departments.Women&apos;s Employment.    General  Situation. Eeports from the divisions  indicate  that unemployment  andunder-employment are generally on  the  increase.  Women&apos;s  unemployment insurancebooks lodged have increased by  11,000 in  a week.  It is clear that, in so far as the  coal strike was concerned, the textile industry was the most seriously affected of the women&apos;strades, but  slackness in this industry and increasing  short time were developing beforethe strike.   The North-Western, Yorkshire and East Midlands, and Scotland divisions are mainly affected.    London report that there is still  serious unemployment among women in Stepney,Deptford, Poplar, Bermondsey and Woolwich.   The Exchanges in these areas each haveregisters  of approximately 1,800  women, over 1,000 of whom are claiming unemploymentinsurance benefit. There are  no indications of improvement in the clothing industry,but with the approach of Christmas,  more activity  is apparent in  the food factories.    The  South Midlands and  Eastern Division report that serious depression continuesin the boot, hosiery, ready-make clothing and silk industries.   In the last case the situationis said to be mainly due to difficulties in connection with foreign markets,  but transportdelays are also affecting the position.   Other industrial enterprises, apart from the largestaple industries, are also affected by the general depression.  The flax production factory at  Peterborough is closed for the present, 100  women having been dismissed; Me srs.North &amp; Sons,  Ltd., Watford, speedometer manufacturers, are dismissing  a  number oftheir women workers ; and the works of the British Mirror Co., in the same town, are closed.                       LOCAL  EMPLOYMENT  COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.    Unemployment and Resettlement. The Trowbridge Committee raised the question ofthe functions and powers now  held  by  Courts of  Eeferees, and  suggested  that theseunctions should be transferred to the Local Employment Committees.Employment and Insurance Department-continued.
 Employment and  Insurance  Department-continued.     The  Lowestoft Committee have passed a resolution requesting that all agricultural workers unemployed  should be asked to apply through the Employn ent Exchange.   It was stated that the number of agricultural workers seeking employment was 500, but that as a general rule they did not register for employment at the Exchange.     The  Crewe Committee consider that a full discussion of the unemployment problem at a national conference of Local Employment Committees is desirable.  Wood  Green draw attention to  the large number of women at present employed by banks, and recom- mended the withdrawal  of this practice to facilitate  the resettlement of ex-Service men. Finchley  recommend  that all employers should be urged to dispense with the services  of married women whose husbands  are in a position to keep them.     Ex-Service Men. A letter was read at a meeting of the Barnstaplc Committee from the secretary of the local branch of the potters&apos; union, to the effect that all the members had voted against the  training  of disabled ex-Service men in the pottery trade.   A resolution was  passed  asking the local pottery  workers to reconsider their decision, and to try and do something to assist the disabled  ex-Service  men.     Miscellaneous. Strong  comment was made by the Birmingham Committee on the department^ decision to replace  by ex-Service men certain temporary assistants,  some having many years&apos;  service  in  the  Exchanges.  The  committee decided to leave the matter for the  present in the hands of the chairman.     OUT-OF-WORK  DONATION AND  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE  BENEFIT.     Out-of-Worlc Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 4th November, show 124,123 payments to policy holders involving an amount of  145,703 5s. Id.   These figures include some payments not reported last week.     Unemployment Insurance Benefit. The payments of unemployment insurance benefit made during the week ending the 29th October involved an amount of  38,132 16s. lOd.                               JUVENILE BRANCH. Juvenile Employment Committees.     Two-Shift System: Juvenile  Workers. The desirability of retaining Clause 2 of the Women,  Young Persons  and Children (Employment)  Bill,  in so far as concerns juvenile workers, has now been submitted to the majority of  Juvenile Employment Committees. Of the 107 committees passing resolutions on the subject, only nine did not object to the employment of those  between 14 and 18 years of age  on the two-shift system.   In 13 cases the committees only objected  to  such employment for  those under  16 years  of age.  In the remaining 86 cases, objection  was  taken to the employment of any juvenile worker as early as 6 a.m. or as late as 10 p.m.    The representative of the Juvenile Branch, who gave evidence before the committee appointed by the  Home Secretary, accordingly reported  that the weight of opinion  of Juvenile Employment Committees was against the retention of the  clause.   The reasons given were that home  life is adversely affected by restriction of the hours of sleep, the irregularity of meals,  and the disorganisation  of  family life; that  workers  on the late shift are debarred  from organised recreation, at which  attendance m alternate weeks is never found satisfactory; and that the system will conflict seriously with the institution of dav continuation classes.    Training for Agricultural  Work. A number of Juvenile Employment Committees, including  Carnarvon, Kent, Newport and Plymouth,  have been making preliminary in- quiries into the need for training  juveniles  for agricultural  work.   The  Carnarvon Committee passed a resolution in June, urging the Ministry of Agriculture to call a conference to discuss the possibility of instituting a system of training  or apprenticeship.  On the 5th October a  conference was held, attended  by representatives  of the Ministries of Agriculture and Labour   and  of the Board of Education, and of  the  farmers&apos;  and agricultural labourers&apos;  unions.   It became clear that the term &quot; apprenticeship &quot; wouldnot be viewed with favour either by farmers  or labourers, and that the word &quot; training &quot;would have to be used instead.  It was also evident that only  on  some  farms  coulduseful training in all the ordinary branches of agriculture be arranged ; and that farmers and labourers,  as  to  the advantages  of  the  system,  would prove equally  difficult ofconviction. It  was decided, however, that  the  whole question needed- investigation,    (B 16645)                                                            4 G 2
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.and it was agreed that the Ministry of Agriculture should prepare a memorandum  tobe submitted to  another conference.  The representative  of  the  Ministry of Labouragreed to  assist  in  the  preparation of  this memorandum.   The Kent,  Newport andPlymouth Committees are now inviting the local employers&apos; and workers&apos;  associations  toconsider the problem.    [References to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department willalso be found on pages 578 to 580, 582, 583, 588, 590, 598 and 599.]APPOINTMENTS  AND  TRAINING.    APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL  LIABILITIES  DEPARTMENT.                               APPOINTMENTS.    Statistics. During the week ending the 5th November the Appointments Departmentplaced 419 candidates for appointments,  bringing the total number of candidates knownto have been placed to 44,246.  Of these,  6,019 were placed through the agency  of thedepartments Interviewing Boards.  Applications were registered from 694 ex-Service menand 24  civilians.  The number  of candidates available for appointments on the 5thNovember was 11,772 ex-Service men and 1,558 civilians.  At the same date 1,237 &quot; live &quot;vacancies were at  the disposal of the department, 569 having been registered during theweek.   In connection with the local reorganisation of the department, dealt with lastweek, it should be noted that the title  &quot;  Directorate &quot; has been replaced in all cases by&quot;District.&quot;                  BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.    Maintenance and Training  Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 5th november the Appointments  Department received applications for training under this scheme from131 officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 68 were  for  training ofthe type provided  by the department.  Deducting cancellations and withdrawals,  28,251applications for training of this  latter type have been received in all, and 50,256 for trainingof the type provided by other  Government departments.  The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,367  applications, of which 22,972 have been recommended. The GrantsCommittee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,829 applications,and sanctioned grants in 18,006 cases.    The Grants Committee have noted  with  the greatest satisfaction that, out of 183candidates who  successfully passed the Final  Examination of the Law Society, held inOctober last, 76 were trained under the Training Grants Scheme of the Ministry of Labour.    Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Departmenthave dealt with a total  of 903 cases, in 430 of which the training sanctioned is provided bythe Appointments  Department and in the remainder by other Government departments.Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 221 cases,and abandoned training in 40 ;  142 are still in training, and 27 are awaiting training.                       TRAINING   DEPARTMENT.                           INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and other Ex-Service Men.    Statistics. On the 9th November  24,970 men were in training, as against 24,943 onthe 2nd November and  25,083 on the 13th October.  The number of men placed in trainingduring the week was 678.  There were 17,329 men  awaiting training, the correspondingtotals for the 2nd  November and the 13th  October being 17,262 and 17,219, respectively.&apos;The number of men whose  training had  been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was20,137, the totals  for the 2nd  November and  the 13th October being 19,486 and 18,085,respectively.    The figures for the week are decidedly more satisfactory than those  for  some little time past.  The large  number placed in training is probably  accounted  for largely by increased admissions to Government Instructional Factories.  A number of new factories
Appointments  and  Training-continued.have started within the last few weeks, and some of  them are developing rapidly.  Thevery large number of terminations during the week has been more  than counterbalancedby new admissions, and once again there lias been a slight rise in the number of men under instruction.   Men appear to be now passing out of training at the rate of 2,000 a month.On the other hand, the slight upward tendency in the waiting list is still maintained.    Approximately 30 per cent, of the men in training are in institutions of the factorytype.   Education authorities, now that there is increasing pressure  on accommodation forall forms of continued education, are glad  of the opportunity  of releasing space hithertoutilised for disabled, men.    Local Reports. Training work has clearly reached a distinctly critical stage in almost all divisions.  The position is thus summed up by the Divisional Director for Middlesex.&quot; The  problems of accommodation and, to some extent,  of equipment,  have now  beensolved. .   .  .  The main obstacle lies at  the other end of the scheme.  T3ie coal strikeaccentuated the difficulty of finding improvership vacancies, and its  effects in this directionare likely  to last for a considerable time.  The other  difficulty is one which has recentlybeen frequently referred to,  the  reluctance of many staple trades to accept  additionaltrainees.&quot;    Constant reference is made to the special difficulties with the building trade operatives.Apart, however, from such special difficulties,  there  is much  that is encouraging.  OneDivisional Director draws attention to the development of the social side of factory life inhis division.   &quot; Sports clubs have been organised in many centres, and regular concertsand socials are a feature of the welfare programme.  At least one factory has notified its intention of taking part  in the ceremony on Armistice Day, a fund  having been raised fora wreath to be placed on the Cenotaph.  The factories have undoubtedly become socialunits.&quot;    In the West Midlands Division good progress is being made with the erection of houses by men in  training under the  Birmingham Housing Scheme.   A  further site  has  been allocated,  for four houses, and a start has already been made.   The Birmingham Chamberof Commerce have offered the Divisional Director space in their monthly journal, to bring before the members of  the Chamber particulars of the work  of the department in thedistrict, and of its special requirements.    In the  London Division a  new form of training, namely, making artificial arms, isunder  consideration.   It is proposed that the entire limb shall be made by men who have lost an arm, and they will subsequently  be  trained to  use the limb.   The wearer can holda hammer, drive nails, and lift small articles from the bench, and can raise the arm withoutany assistance.    Government Instructional Factories. At the Bristol Factory,  the new  extension is rapidly nearing completion.   As far as possible the equipment is already being carried outby men in training.   The electrical engineering class  are installing a complete system ofelectric light and power in the new building, a big task for men in training.    A manager has been appointed for the Belfast Factory, the first  factory in Ireland, andit is hoped that training will start in a few weeks.    National Trade Advisory Committees:  Gold, Silver, Horological  and Allied Trades. Ameeting of the committee was held on the  10th November.   The  Committee desired to impress upon the Divisional Directors that only such numbers of men should be placed intraining as can be absorbed by the trade in  the locality in which the training is conducted.They were of opinion that no good purpose  could be served by a further extension of theperiod of training.    Local Technical Advisory Committees : Building. The inaugural meeting of the WestWiltshire  Local Technical Advisory Committee was held at  Trowbridge on  the  10thNovember.  The committee should materially assist in the reduction of  the waiting listof the  South-Western Division.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.    Statistics. Up to the 10th November,  agreements had been received  at headquarters in respect of 44,733 apprentices under the  41 schemes approved.   Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 42,779 apprentices, employed by 16,858 employers.  The total numberof agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of  training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 13,131.    Wages. The existence of five grades of workmen, in receipt of different rates of wages,is causing difficulty in the brass trade at Birmingham.  The union concerned claim that
Appoint iiients  and Training-continued.apprentices under the scheme should be paid on the basis of the highest rate.  Some firms,indeed, are reported to be paying on this basis.  Others, however, are taking the rate ofthe lowest grade, 80s. Qd. per week, as the prescribed rate, and the employers&apos; associationare supporting them. They maintain that if the men prove incompetent, de-grading willbe  difficult, and  they are not prepared  to  take apprentices under the scheme if thisarrangement is insisted upon.    Messrs.  Snawdon Bros., Ltd.,  Plymouth, furniture manufacturers,  attribute a strike of their journeymen to the influence of  the scheme.  The men discovered that the pro-portion of the prescribed rate paid  to the apprentice was more than their own piece-workearnings.  They struck  for an increase, and the strike has lasted four months.  Localheadquarters point  out that, as the apprentice is being paid  only Is. \\d. per hour, theworkmen&apos;s dissatisfaction is hardly surprising.    Applications. At Leith,  except for one or two plumbers, there appear to  be no morecases to deal with.  In Kirkcaldy, there are no outstanding cases.    Non-Observance of  Conditions. A  satisfactory  settlement  has been secured with messrs.  J. &amp; J.  M^Morland,  Glasgow,  electrical engineers, with whom there  have beenlong-standing difficulties.   They objected to  the conditions of the scheme,  and,  afteradopting it,  refused to carry out their agreements.General Training.    Supply  of Apprentices:  Ironfounding. Contrary to  general  experience  in various districts, a large Mansfield firm have no trouble in securing apprentices, notwithstanding the competition of neighbouring collieries.   This is apparently due to the increased wages paid locally to foundry  apprentices.   This firm&apos;s present  rates, for instance,  range from14s. per week at 14, to 45s. at 20, and they state that they are not losing by paying suchrates.    Supply  of Apprentices  : Building. At Barrow, no apprentices were forthcoming duringthe war, owing to the demands of munitions work.  They are  still difficult to secure  andto retain.  Moreover, the  journeymen do not appear anxious to teach them.   A shortageof well-trained men is already reported.   At  Oxford, on the other hand,  it is  difficult to induce builders to take apprentices.    Tinplate Works (Wales). The prospects  for boys are reported to have improved, asa result of a recent  agreement to provide mill men with helpers.   This will cause the coldroll department to absorb numerous youths, provided  that  they are physically  fit and prepared to undergo the necessary training.   There are further prospects of promotion toother work,  such as pickling and behinding, for which wages are excellent.    The employment of boys in washeries and coke-ovens, connected with blastfurnaces,is reported to be very largely a blind alley, as few can hope to become furnace-men.  More-over, the making of silica  and concrete bricks in connection with these works is described as &quot; cruel work for  boys,&quot; as the lime proves most injurious.  Throughout the works, it isstated that  promotion is generally by seniority, the unions being opposed to promotionby capacity.    A distinct shortage of recruits for unskilled and semi-skilled work is reported in the&quot; black &quot; branch of the industry.  Most  of  the boys are employed as heaters and pinstackers, having hitherto started as early as the age of 13.   The only prospect of promotionis to secure  a vacancy on a heading machine.  This hope of advancement is not bright atany time, and owing to the promotion of ex-Service  men from labouring  work  to the machines, the openings for the boys are now  even fewer than usual.  Most of them, evenin normal times, leave the trade after a few years.  One large firm tried the experiment offormally indenturing about 100 lads, and giving them facilities to attend technical classes.None of the lads remained with them.  Many had to be discharged for lack of industry,and some were discovered to be selling special drawings to other firms.  In the hand-forged branch, on the other hand, few boys are employed, and there is practically no blind-alley work.   Owing to the absence of heating, comparatively few are engaged in the brightnut and bolt branch, which is mainly dependent on female workers.  Here boys may riseto be toolsetters or moulders.

APPENDIX.                          QUESTIONS  IN  PARLIAMENT.     The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested. Unemployment Insurance.     Sir W. Damson asked the Minister of Labour for what reason an employer is liable to pay his share of the contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Act in the case of persons in receipt of a pension or income of the annual value  of at least  26, although such persons will not be entitled to receive unemployment benefit and are not themselves required to make any contribution.     Dr. Macnamara : The provision in the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, requiring the employer&apos;s share of the ordinary contribution to be paid in respect of an exempt person follows the precedent established by the National Health Insurance Acts.   The State also pays a contribution.  Exempt persons are not entitled to unemployment benefit so long as they remain exempt.   If, however, in any particular case the exemption lapses and the person concerned becomes entitled to benefit in the ordinary way, the contributions paid in respect  of him as an exempt person becomes available for increasing the amount of benefit to which he would otherwise have been entitled. (Sth November.) Business Training Scheme.     Viscount Curzon asked the Minister of Labour what steps he proposes to take to bring the business and commercial training scheme for officers, to which reference has been made in the Press, more directly before the heads of the firms from which he is seeking assistance.     Dr. Macnamara : I am much obliged to my noble friend for putting this question; and  I  am no less obliged to the Press for the wide publicity they have already given to this  scheme.   It is a scheme under which business firms are invited to take an ex-officer or man of similar educational qualifications for a period not exceeding twelve months in order to get  the  run of the concern the Government finding maintenance during that period. An honourable undertaking will be asked of the firms to guarantee a salaried post to the officer  concerned, if he shapes well, for at least a second twelve months. I am glad to say that I  have already received a number of offers from the heads of business firms to adopt this scheme.  We propose to canvass the business  firms of the country both personally and by written communication.  I take the opportunity to say that anybody  interested will be supplied with full details of the scheme on application to the Controller, Appointments Department, St. Ermin&apos;s Hotel, Caxton Street, Westminster, S.W., or by making local application for the same to the district director of the locality. (10th November.) Unemployment (Government Schemes).    Mr. R. Young asked the Prime Minister whether  he is  aware that in 1915 the then Postmaster-General  publicly enumerated prepared schemes  which the Government had ready to cope with dangerous social problems which might arise as a result of unemploy- ment after the war was over, and that among these  schemes wrere plans for dealing with afforestation, improvement of  harbours, and the building of light railways;  whether, seeing the anticipation of much unemployment is now being fulfilled, it is intended to put these prepared schemes into operation ; and, if so, to what extent will they be utilised and iii which parts of the country will they take effect.    Dr.  Macnamara:  I  have  been  asked  to  reply.  I  have  not  been able, in  the time at my disposal, to trace  the  announcement  referred to by my hon. friend, but  a  number  of  schemes  of the nature described  are  in fact in process  of  being carried out. The Forestry Commissioners propose planting 5,000 acres during the present winter, and this is expected to employ about 500 men.  In addition to a number of schemes for harbour development and  maintenance under consideration, a number of harbour schemes financed from the Development Fund are at present in progress in Scotland and Ireland.  In connection with light railways, the Ministry of Transport has established a development Committee, which is in course of considering various schemes which have beenput forward with a view to selecting those most required in  the national interest.  Withregard to the whole matter, the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment is considering furtheravenues which seem to afford an opportunity of providing employment. (9th November.)
