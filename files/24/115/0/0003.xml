Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.This Document  is the Property ofHis  Britannic tVinjss:.y*s government it n 1* o 1 n 3   I   I Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State,b,P*  Z  &apos;      Aco//     &apos;     &apos;         dated 8th November 1920.L        owing is the weeldy telegram:       on-co-operation movement not gaining many practical  adherents, and attemptto seduce schoolboys at Aligarh, Lahore, and Amritsar, condemned by great  body ofpublic especially parents who realise serious consequences.  Gandhi, however, thoughdefeated in first round will not give  up fight, and as he is  criticised for attackingSikh  and Muhammadan institutions  first, is said to  be about to tackle Benares andAllahabad.  Constant tours of Gandhi and Ali  brothers and  unceasing stream ofvirulent  attacks  on Government in Press and  on platform sustain atmosphere ofpermanent excitement,  creating  strong anti-Government  feeling  of a  dangerouscharacter amongst masses, and familiarising them with idea of  extremist  politiciansas to complete Swaraj and independence of Great Britain.   As advised by  BombayGovernment, we do not  contemplate  prosecution in single  case  of Central  KhilafatCommittee or executive  leaders of non-co-operation  movement,  as that has beennominally  endorsed by Congress, and  any, general  prosecution would be likely to consolidate against Government many shades of political opinion, and  would hindernatural development  of  disruptive  forces  now manifesting  themselves  amongextremists.  In many quarters,  strong feeling against Gandhi&apos;s vagaries, but not yetwrell organised.  Opinion still held by some that movement will kill itself by its  ownfolly and violence.  Vigorous stand taken against it in every province, and  signs of organised opposition in Bihar, United Provinces, Bombay and Bengal.  Our policy,therefore, will continue on existing lines.  We are about to issue resolution explainingpolicy hitherto adopted, i.e., non-interference as far as compatible with public safety,and our  intention to  continue this policy unless and  until compelled  to abandon it ininterests of law abiding citizens to whom strong appeal is made for concerted effort to stop any further  extension of mischievous  propaganda among students and  illiteratemasses.   Besides prosecutions for  definite  breaches of law,  we  are  consideringadoption of other means of impeding non-co-operation movement, e,g., under telegraphand postal codes to stop  objectionable telegraphy and postal  matter and  withholdGovernment  advertisements  from papers  advocating non-co-opera^on.   Volunteermovement has also our careful attention and will  be  subject  of later  communicationwhen we have received fuller information  and opinions  of  the  Local Governments.Provincial reports as follows :     United  Provinces. Latest developments  of Aligarh  College have  been fullyreported to you  by  Education Department.  Following appreciation of results of gandhi&apos;s and Ali brothers&apos; tour in province furnished by  Local Governments  :     &quot; At each place visited big meetings were  held.  Speeches delivered in almost all&quot; cases seditious in spirit  and  frequently  in letter.  Speeches under examination by  legal advisers to see whether they violate  law.   Result will be reported later.  Visit&quot; of party to each centre occasion  of local ebullition which died away  w;hen they  left.  Newspaper excitement maintained for propaganda, thing apart.   Result on public&quot; opinion neither wide nor permanent.,   Khilafat question and Punjab  incidents used&quot; only for inflammatory purposes.  Their  redress no longer main object.   Non-co-&quot; operation  sole  means to complete freedom  which will redress  all  grievances is&quot; common  line   taken.   Little  success   in  securing  proof  of  practical  non-co-&quot; operation.  Few honorary magistrates gave up  offices  and few legal practitioners&quot;withdrawn from  practice.  On the  other hand, all  loyal men  and-even many&quot; waverers shocked by violent language used and eyes opened to dangers being run.&quot; At  length  realise need of counter-propaganda and counter-organisation.&quot;   two persons convicted of sedition.   No dearth of candidates  for  election.  Kisan  Saghaappears divided, some favouring non-co-operation, others  anxious to have cultivatorsrepresented on  new  council.   Trustees  Kayastha,  Pathshala, Allahabad, protested against non-co-operation movement as applied to students.  Lieutenant-Governor hasbeen making useful tour visiting educational institutions and advising students while taking natural interest in political discussions and debates to avoid practical politicstill students&apos; days over, and  not sacrifice college  career to any  Will-of-the-Wispoutside college studies. &apos;   2710   100   11.20

District  officers being circularised as  to necessity for adequate though unobtrusive  police precautions in the event of disorders during theelections.  Widest possible publicity being given to terms of sections 171 C. and F.of the Indian Penal Code.  Leaders of non-co-operation movement carefully avoidedreference to penalties under these  provisions, attaching to undue pressure on votersor candidates for election, and  this knowledge now filtering  through to rank and  file.may have salutary effect.  Some resumption of  Hijrat movement talked of by CentralKhilafat  Committee, not  unchecked as  before,   but under  Central  Committee&apos;sguidance,  only  selected men  likely  to be  economic  gain to Afghanistan  beingpermitted to go.
