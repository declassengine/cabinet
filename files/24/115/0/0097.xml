The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of transport was asked by the Unemployment  Committee cf the Cabinet to send  amemorandum to the Cabinet on the above subject.          I cannot do better than refer the Cabinet to my memorandum, dated the 20th March, 1920, (CP.921), and taConclusion number 2 of Cabinet 16(20)of the 23rd March, 1920.          I have no materiaj. on which to change the opinionsthen expressed, and our experience of Woolwich locomotive and wagonconstruction and wagon repair  is as given in the attached memorandum which has been prepared by the Parliamentary Secretary.I have no knowledge whatsoever of the Gretna Factory.

433Locomotive and Wagon construction and Wagon repair at Woolwich.     LOOQMOTIvHS:   An order for building 100 2-6-0 type  locomotiveswas placed with Woolwich in November,  1919,  without apparently  anyprice for the ongines being quoted,  although at a subsequent date anestimato cf  10,000 per engine was put forward, and without any arrangements for the disposal of the engines when completed havingbeen arrived at.          Woolwich were, and are, unable to  manufacture the Boilers,and they were ordered elsewhere          It is now very nearly twelve months since the order was placed, but not a single engine has been completed, so far as weare aware, although it was anticipated that  delivery tf the firstengine would tak* place in September last.          It is possible that the estimated  cost of the ongineswill be very greatly exceeded.          In February last, Woolwich proposed to undertake thebuilding tf Locomotives for the Great Northern Railway Company; theidea being that the Company would place an experienced Inspectorat Woolwich, and that the experience thus gained would beinvaluable in carrying out the work on the 100 enginos now being built.   This proposal was, however, not proceeded with.          I am of opinion that Woolwich has  not the facilitiesfor the building of locomotives economically or rapidly.     WAGONS.          New Construction.          Orders woro placed as follows          The Groat Western Railway Company ordered 500 12-tonOpen Goods wagons on November 26th, 1919, at a price of  297por wagon, delivery to commence in January last, and to bo                                                       completed
434I)    completed next month.   So far it is understood that  throe wagons      hove been delivered, and Woolwich are now asking that the      contract price should be increased to  430 per wagon.                The North Eastern Railway Company placed  an order  for      2,000 similar wagons with Woolwich on August 1st, 1919,  at a      cost of  170 per wagon, subject to the rise or fall in the      cost of labour and material.   Up to the 27th ultimo  704 wagons      had. been delivered^                It should be borne in mind that the price above quoted      is based on the Railway Company supplying wheels, axles, springs,      etc,                The total number of wagons repaired by Woolwich up      to the 27th ultimo was 1,528, though as wo do not know the date      from which the figures were started, we cannot say  exactly what      the average number repaired per week is.   It appears, however,,      that this figure is something in the nature of 22 per week.      In any case the figure quoted by Sir James Stevenson,  iee. 30,      cannot be called excessive.                To enable wagons to be economically and rapidly      manufactured, the lay-out of the factory and sidings  has to      be very carefully considered and plenty of space with the      necessary lifting appliances provided.    Woolwich does not      appear to possess such facilities.M^iJoieinMr, .1920.
