PART  I-THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The most notable event of the Week from the point of view of the labour  situation has been the meeting in.Lond.on on the 22nd November of a special International Congressconvened under the auspices of the International Federation of Trade Unions.*  Atten-tion may also be called to the report of the acceptance by the International  ShippingFederation of the invitation of the International Seamen&apos;s Federation, conveyed throughthe International Labour Office, to hold a joint meeting in January, in order, if possible,to arrive at some agreement on the question of hours of labour on board ship.    Many trades continue to suffer to some extent from the immediate results of the coal strike, and with this fact perhaps maybe connected the quietness of the industrial situationin so far as disputes are concerned.    Public attention has to a considerable extent been drawn from the labour  situation to more political issues the Irish question and the first meeting of the Assembly of theLeague of Nations.  The Trades Union Congress is not directly concerned in the  proposedLabour mission of inquiry to Ireland.    The Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number for the [1st November was 176, ascompared with a figure of 164 for the 1st October. The increase was due mainly to the risein the retail prices of flour and bread, following a reduction of the subsidy, but partly alsoto increases in the prices of butter, milk and eggs.    In the House of Lords, the Shops (Early Closing) (No. 2) Bill was read a second time on the 16th November, and passed through Committee on the 18th, and the Report stageon the 22nd.  The Women and  Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) bill was read a second time in the same House on the 18th November, and passed through theCommittee stage on the 22nd, when some detailed amendments were made.  The secondreading of the Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill was taken in the House of commons on the 18th November.FEATURES  OF  THE WEEK.General Topics.    Women,  Young Persons  and Children (Employment) Bill. It  will be rememberedthat Clause 2 of this Bill, which permitted, subject to any conditions which the Secretaryof State might prescribe, double shifts for women and young persons between the hoursof 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., provoked  strenuous opposition,  particularly  from the textile industries, and the Standing Committee  of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, attachedto the Labour Party.  In Standing Committee A, of the House of Commons, this clausewas removed from the Bill.  A departmental committee was appointed by the Secretaryof State for Home Affairs on the 18th August &quot; to consider whether it was desirable thatthe Factory and Workshops Acts  should be so amended as to allow women and youngpersons to be employed on the system of  two day-shifts, and if so, what  should be thelength of the shifts,  and the time  for beginning and ceasing work.&quot;f The committeeadopted  their report on the  12th November. It Was presented to Parliament  on the16th November, and has now been published.                                * See p. 606 below.   f The composition of the Committee was given in this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 288,
    In the summary of their conclusions, the committee recognise that the experience ofthe two day-shift system is limited, and that the whole question has not yet passed out ofthe experimental  stage.   They believe, however, that  a case has been made out  for allowing, under certain conditions, the adoption of the shift system in continuous industries,seasonal trades, and in factories in which the plant and premises are temporarily insufficient.They are further of opinion that it is in the national interest, subject to proper safeguardsand supervision, that an  opportunity for  trying the system  should  be given to thoseemployers and trade union organisations who desire to introduce it as a regular part oftheir industrial system for the purpose of increasing production.    The committee, however, do not think that the experience of the system so far obtainedis sufficient to enable them to recommend its incorporation as a permanent part of factorylegislation.   It should be regarded as an experiment, and further inquiry should be made after a certain period into its working and effects.  If sanction, therefore, be given in theBill to the adoption of the system, the committee suggest that it should be for a limited period of, say, five  years.  They further recommend that the Home Office should retain the power, exercised at present, of deciding in what cases the adoption of the system shouldbe allowed,  and that, for this  purpose, its adoption in any works should be dependenton the issue of a Home Office Order, and subject to  such conditions to secure  the welfare of the workers  as may be attached to the Order.  These Orders would be liable to be withdrawn in the case of any abuse.     The  committee do not  recommend any alteration  in the hours  originally  proposedin the Bill,  that is, 6 a.m. to 10 p.ni.  They believe that the reduction of the period ofemployment to less than 8 hours would in most cases prevent the adoption of the system,while it would not remove the chief objections, which are the weekly turnover of shifts,and the evening work  in  alternate periods.  They think that the objections to the hoursproposed have  been exaggerated, and the Home Office will be able, by the conditionsthey attach to their Orders, to safeguard the interests of the workers.     The  specific recommendations of the committee  are therefore as follows :            1. The  Secretary of State should be given power to make Orders allowing the employment of        women and young persons of 16 years of age and over on a system of two day-shifts of not more than        eight hours&apos; average duration, between the hours of  6 a.m. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Friday,        and 6 am. and 2 p.m. on Saturday.  These Orders should be granted for individual factories, or for        a  class or group of factories, subject to such  conditions  as the Secretary of State may consider        necessary to safeguard the welfare and interests of the workers. The Orders should be liable to        withdrawal, in the event of non-compliance with the conditions or of any abuse arising, but, subject        to this, should be regarded as intended to be effective for the period hereinafter mentioned.            2. The  Orders should not extend to young persons under 16 years of age, but an exception        should be allowed for those young persons under 16 who are at the present time employed on the shift        system, so long as they remain in their present employment.            3. The  power to make the Orders should be given for a limited period of five years in the first        instance,  and at the end of, say, four years, inquiry should be made into the whole question in the        light of the  additional experience gained.            i. The  power of the Home Office to impose conditions should be made to extend to the employ-        ment of boys in the glass trade under the powers conferred by Section 55of the Factory and Workshops        Act,  1901.      The committee deal in their report with the suggestion that the  proposal to  employ women and young persons on a  two-shift system  is inconsistent with the spirit of the Conventions adopted  by the International Labour Conference at Washington.   This suggestion appears to them to be unfounded.   &quot; There is nothing in the Conventions which is inconsistent  in any way  with employment on a two-shift system during the day.  On the contrary, it was recognised in the debates on the Conventions that employment on a two-shift system during the day was admissible.&quot;      Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. A  joint committee of  the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Mining Association  were  received by Sir David Shackleton on the  19th November.  A  request was  put  forward for the exclusion  of the coal industry from the Act, on the ground that &quot; the average percentage of unemployment is less  than 15.&quot;  In reply, it was stated  that a certificate of  exception could not be granted.   The joint committee  decided  therefore to prepare a &quot;contracting out&quot; scheme, under which it is hoped to provide a benefit of 305.  per week.      The National Federation of General Workers have decided to recommend the organisa- tions in  the federation to undertake the working of the Act.   An endeavour will also be made to put on a more uniform basis  the unemployment benefit  schemes at present administered by the federated unions.      (B 16666)                                                               4 H 2
     The Cost of Living. It  will be remembered that the joint  committee appointed to investigate the increased cost of living by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Union  issued an interim report on the 8th September,* and that this report was followed a few weeks later by a manifesto from the Federation of British Industries enunciating the belief that the proper remedy for the present  high level of prices is increased production, f     The joint committee have now issued a reply to this manifesto, stating that the point of view  from which it is written &quot; is one which the committee cannot accept.&quot;  The reply deals, inter alia, with wages and prices, output and shorter hours, the regulation of prices, increased output and industrial efficiency, the &apos;* ca&apos; canny of modern business,&quot; the division of the product of industry, and world exhaustion.     As regards increases in wages, it is  contended that, although wage increases have been followed by a rise in prices, applications for the revision of wages, in general, have been made in order to meet a previous rise in the cost of living ;  and, with respect to reduced hours, the statement is made that &quot; organised  labour could certainly not accept the point  of view that every reduction of hours must be accompanied by redoubled efforts.  Rather does it look to  the  better  organisation and use of industrial capital to maintain and increase production.&quot;  The last report of the Chief Inspector of Factories is quoted as showing that reduction of  hours does not necessarily result in diminished output.j:   Similarly, in  dealing with the question of increased output,  it is argued that &quot; restricted production and high prices are  in large measure due to defective organisation, and the  enormous differences in efficiency which  now exist between  firm and firm &quot; ;  and it  is definitely  stated that &quot; deliberate  restriction of output, or &apos; ca&apos;. canny,&apos; is an accepted policy of modern business enterprise.&quot;   It is also  emphasised that the prices which the consumer pays  for com- modities are &quot; determined by the costs of production of  inefficient firms.&quot;     On  the  question of  the regulation  of prices, the committee assert that the  existence of control  &quot; prevented undue exploitation, and the withdrawal of control was followed by soaring  prices and soaring profits.&quot;  Finally,  the  Federation of British Industries are accused  of neglecting the international  aspects of the problem;  and the committee con- clude with the statement that&quot; however great our efforts may be,  their harvest will  depend upon the establishment  of international peace, the reform of continental currencies,  and the flotation of  an international loan  or its equivalent.&quot;     Labour and Russia. The attention of the Labour movement has again been drawn to the question  of trade  with Eussia,  by a manifesto  published in the Labour Press, on the 16th  November, by  the  National Council  of  Action, and addressed  to all local Councils of Action and trade union organisations.   In this manifesto it  was urged that &quot;  British Imperialism and reactionary influences in the Cabinet&quot; are preventing the resump- tion of  trading relations with  Russia,  on the  ground  that any agreement  arrived at between the two  countries would imply a recognition of the Soviet Government.   The manifesto states that it is of vital importance to this country that peace should be made with Russia, as  the demand for British manufactured goods would increase employment,  and the import of raw materials would cause prices to fall.  The manifesto ends with an appeal to all the local Councils to promote a &quot; Trade and Peace with Russia &quot;  campaign by organis- ing special meetings, sending resolutions to members  of Parliament, and by distributing the pamphlets  prepared by  the National  Council dealing  with trade  with Russia in relation to  unemployment and the cost  of living.    Labour and Ireland. On the 18th November, the Executive Committee of the Labour Party  issued  a  manifesto on the Irish question, calling attention to &quot; the  very grave situation which  has  arisen, menacing to life and property, destructive of order, and dis- crediting the British Government throughout the world.&quot;  It is argued that the  Parlia- mentary  Labour Party is powerless in the House of Commons to  effect any improvement, and that it therefore remains for the Labour Party publicly to dissociate itself from the &quot; maladministration exercised in the name of the British  people.&quot;    The  manifesto ends with the statement that, as the request made by the parliamentary labour Party that there should  be an inquiry into the allegations regarding reprisals hasbeen refused,  it has been decided that a joint commission representative of the Labour party should visit Ireland to make inquiries.  It has also been decided to conduct a great nationalcampaign to enlighten the public on the facts of the Irish situation.                    * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 12,18th September, p. 359.                    f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 16,16th October, p. 454.                    J See this Report, Vol. II, No. 16,16th October, p. 456.
     The joint commission of inquiry has now been appointed, and was to have sailed for Ireland on the 22nd November, but, owing to the events in Dublin during the last week-end, its departure has been postponed.   The commission consists of Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P.,  chairman;  Messrs. T. Lawson, M.P., and W. Lunn, M.P., representing the Parlia- mentary Labour Party;   Messrs. A. G. Cameron and F. J.  Jowett, chairman and vice- chairman of the Executive Council of the Labour Party, and Mr. T. Bromley, representing the Executive Council of the Labour Party.   The secretary is  Mr. Arthur Greenwood.     The conference  of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, which was determined upon by the conference of Irish railwaymen on the 9th November, was duly held in Dublin on the 16th.     A resolution was passed that, having regard to the gravity of the situation with which the country is faced, trade unions involved in strikes for improved conditions of labour should withdraw their demands,  without prejudice to future action.     With regard to the railway  crisis,* the question of the continuance of the &quot; strike &quot; was left to the railwaymen  themselves; and a resolution was  passed calling  on all sections of the community to support the railway  workers,  should they maintain their attitude.   It has been suggested that a ballot of the railwaymen should be taken on the 28th November.  There is at present nothing to indicate that any steps are being taken to secure an early settlement;  dismissals of railway officials are still proceeding, and further branch lines are being shut down. Industrial and other Organisations.    . South  Wales Miners&apos; Federation. On the 13th November, meetings were held  of  the various branches of the Federation to discuss problems arising from the recent settlement. Some resentment appears to have been aroused in certain districts by the decision  of  the National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation  of Great  Britain, following  the precedent of the strike of 1912, to terminate the recent strike because the ballot vote  did not show a two-thirds majority in favour of its continuance.     It Was held at many meetings that steps should be taken to prevent such a thing happening  again, and the Rhondda No. 1 District meeting, in particular, determined that a motion for the complete abolition of the two-thirds majority rule should be put before the Delegate Conference  of the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation.     The proposal to set  up a National Wages Board Was also criticised, and the Garw District passed a resolution calling upon the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain not to consider the question until the principle which Was to govern wages had been referred to the members of the Federation for their approval. Trade Union Topics.     Scottish National Operative Plasterers&apos; Federal Union. The Report of this union for October states that the executive committee have decided to recommend the affiliation of the  union to the National Federation of Building  Trades Operatives.  They have also recommended members to agree  to the adult apprenticeship  scheme for the training of ex-Service  men put  forward  by the Resettlement Committee of  the Industrial  Council together with the proposals of the Minister of Health as to payment  for &quot; wet time &quot; on housing schemes.     w     These  questions will be further considered at a  delegate meeting to be held on the 3rd January. . Ex-Service  Men.    Trade  Unions and Ex-Service Men. A joint committee of the Parliamentary LabourParty and  the Parliamentary Committee of  the Trades Union Congress has  been set upto inquire into the charges against trade unions of placing an embargo  on the admissioninto certain industries of unemployed ex-Service men.   Mr. George  Hicks, presidentof the National Federation of  Building Trades Operatives, has been called into consulta-tion, and it is possible that practical suggestions for dealing with unemployed ex-Servicemen will result.                   * See  this Keport, Vol. II, No. 20, 13th November, p. 553.
International Relations of Labour.    International Seamen&apos;s  Federation. The  General Conference  of  the InternationalLabour Organisation, held at Genoa in July last, failed to adopt by the requisite majoritya draft convention regulating hours of labour for seamen, and,  at the conference of theInternational Seamen&apos;s Federation at Brussels in August, * it was  decided to send a deputa-tion to the Director of the International Labour Office, requesting  him to arrange a meeting between representatives of the shipowners and of the seamen, with a view to arriving atan  agreement on this question.  Failing such a meeting, it was proposed to  arrange  a demonstration 48-hour strike of seamen  at all ports, and, if that were not successful, ageneral international strike of seamen.    The  deputation appointed  by the Brussels conference subsequently visited theDirector  of  the International  Labour  Office,  who  immediately  communicated  withMr.  Cuthbert Laws, the general manager of  the International Shipping iFederation.It has now been announced that the Federation have agreed  to meet  representatives ofthe International Seamen&apos;s Federation, with a view to considering further the  questionof hours of labour on board  ship, and the possibility of arriving  at an agreement.    This appears to be the first occasion on which the International Labour Office haveacted in a mediatory capacity.    International Federation  of Trade Unions.--The, special International Trades UnionCongress, under the auspices of  this body, opened  at the Holborn Restaurant on the92nd  November, and will  continue  until the 27th.f   The Congress comprises delegates from the national trade union organisations of some 18 countries.  There is no delegation from the United States, and the only extra-European delegate comes from Canada.  Thereare also present at  the Congress, representatives of some 18 sectional international tradeunion  federations, but,  though these delegates may take part in the  proceedings, theyhave no power to vote.  The English  trade unionists are represented by seven delegates from  the Parliamentary  Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and  three from theManagement Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions.  The former delega-tion is led by Mr. E. L. Poulton, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee,  and thelatter  delegation by Mr. T.  Mallalieu.  Among the  foreign  delegates present,  mentionmay be made  of  Messrs.  Carl  Legien and P.  Grassmann (Germany),  J.  Jouhauxand M. Bidegaray (France), C. Mertens (Belgium),  L. d&apos;Aragona (Italy)  and H. J. Halford(Canada).    Mr. W. A. Appleton communicated to the conference, by letter, his decision to resignfrom the Presidency of the International Federation of Trade  Unions.  For the purposesof the present  conference, the English delegation were  asked to nominate a successor,and chose Mr.  J.  H. Thomas.    An account of the proceedings of the Congress will be given in this Report next week,but attention may  be drawn to four important features which  have  already become clear.    Firstly, there are present at the Congress 12 representatives  of German trade unions,and, in marked  contrast to the proceedings of every previous general  international con-ference, either of trade unionists or of Socialists, since the war,  the conference immediatelysettled down to  the discussion of post-war problems, and did not spend any time on thequestion of responsibility for the war.    Secondly, this  conference differs  from the previous Congress of  the InternationalFederation, held  at Amsterdam  in  August, in  that  it contains no  representativesof the  American Federation of Labour.  It was stated at the conference that the  responseof the American Federation of Labour to communications from  the Bureau of the Inter-national during  the past year has been very inadequate.    Thirdly, the presence at this conference of representatives of 18 sectional international trade  unions, as, for example, the  International  Transport Workers&apos; Federation, show show very quickly and extensively the rebuilding of the  machinery of  the InternationalFederation of Trade Unions has progressed since the close of the war.    Fourthly, the difference between the British Trades Union Congress and the GeneralFederation of Trade Unions as to the representation of British workers on the InternationalFederation has  not been  allowed  to interfere  with  the  proceedings.  Mr. Appleton&apos;s                    * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 8, 21st August, p. 265.   I The agenda before this Congress was given in this Report, Vol. II, No. 19, 6th November, p. 532.
NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES. Demands and Negotiations.     Building Trades  Operatives  (Various Areas). On the 17th November the National Conciliation  Board for the Building Industry met in London and discussed applications by the Southern Counties building  trades operatives for an increase of Is.  an  hour over the existing rate of 2s.; by the Yorkshire operatives for a levelling up of certain towns, York, Scarborough and Beverley requesting to be raised from Grade  B to  Grade A, and Malton from Grade C to Grade B ;  and by the London building trades operatives for an increase of 8d. an hour for tradesmen and labourers,  the rate applied for being 3s. and 2s. 9d., respectively.   The Board continued their meeting on the 18th November.  The London and  the Yorkshire claims were rejected ; the Southern Counties application was deferred to a further meeting.     Electrical Workers: London County Council Tramways. The dispute has  come to a head this Week between the Electrical Trades Union and the Highways Committee of the London County Council over the demand of the union-for re-classification of some 900 electrical workers in the  employment  of the Tramways  Department, now classified as unskilled and semi-skilled, and their payment at the district rate for skilled operatives. The union have already taken a ballot which resulted in a majority in favour of strike action, and the consent of the executive committee of the union to such action has been forthcoming.  Negotiations, however, are proceeding.     Electrical Power Engineers (National).-T]ie Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, who cater for technical and supervisory engineers in electrical undertakings, have handed in strike notices, to expire on the 14th December, owing to the alleged failure of many of the employers to adopt the schedule  of wages and conditions recommended by the National Joint Board  for the electricity supply industry.  The employers&apos; side  of the Board have circularised all undertakings, urging them to avert the possibility of a national strike by adopting the recommendations.  A  further meeting of the Board will be held on the 4th December to receive  a report from the employers&apos; side as to undertakings which are prepared to  observe the  schedule in its entirety.    . Tramway Depot Workers (Manchester). In connection with the dispute between the semi-skilled men employed on night work at  the Manchester tramway depots, and the Tramway Committee, notices to cease work were handed  in, to  take  effect as from the 20th  November.   On the 19th November, however,  at a  conference between the two parties, the Workers&apos; Union, on behalf of the men involved, agreed that the claim should be. submitted to an ad hoc court.  The terms which the court will consider are :           &quot; That the men shall work a week of six nights of 1\ hours each, at the rate of time-and-a-third,       based upon day rates ; except in regard to overtime between Saturday midnight and Sunday mid-       night, when the rate shall be double time, overtime on week-days to be paid for at the rate of tiine-       and-two-thirds.&quot;    Brewery  Workers  (National). A national conference  of unions representing  general workers in the brewing, malting and  bottling trades met in London on the 18th November, and reaffirmed their decision to  apply for an increase of 10s. a week, with a  minimum weekly Wage  of  4.  The claim will be submitted before the end of January, and a further conference will be called before the end of February to discuss the employers&apos; reply. No agreements accepting wages below the above-mentioned minimum are to be entered intolocally pending another conference.resignation has solved the immediate difficulty, and Mr. J.  H. Thomas&apos;s  succession tohim as President of this conference means that the lead in the British delegation will nowbe taken by the Trades Union Congress.  The present  conference is a special meeting to discuss the particular questions of policy appearing on the agenda, and there is  no occasion for it to deal with constitutional matters.
 Negotiations and Disputes-continued.     Insurance Officials (Royal London Mutual Assurance Society). With reference to last week&apos;s report  that the National  Amalgamated Union of Life Assurance Workers  were handing in strike notices to expire on the 25th November, on behalf  of their members employed  as agents by the Royal London Mutual Assurance Society, it is now reported that the  notices have  been suspended.   The executive council of the Royal  London Mutual Assurance Society Staff Association passed a resolution on the 17th  November, instructing their members to refuse to participate in any strike action,  and to obey only the association^ orders. Settlements and Agreements.     Goal Miners (National). The  joint committee representing the Mining Association of  Great Britain and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, appointed to go into the details of questions arising  out of the recent settlement, including increased output and the setting up  of a National Wages Board, met on the 18th November  in London.  The following resolutions were unanimously adopted :            (1) That this committee be appointed as a Provisional National Committee under the terras of       settlement;           (2) That in each district a district committee should be forthwith set up where it does not       already exist, and at once take into consideration the best method of securing an increased output       of coal in their district, and for this purpose to secure the hearty co-operation of those engaged in       the  collieries.     Commercial Road  Transport  Workers (Yorkshire). As foreshadowed last  week,  a conference was held on the 16th November at Leeds, under the chairmanship of the Lord Mayor, to  consider the position which had arisen in Bradford owing to  the refusal of the men to accept the West  Riding  agreement of the 5th November.   Considerable  feeling was displayed over the non-attendance of Mr. A. Hilton, general secretary of the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association, formerly the United Carters&apos; and Motormen&apos;s associated - ation,  whose members were chiefly concerned in the  Bradford impasse.  The conference formally confirmed the terms of the West Riding agreement, and the  employers&apos; repre- sentatives  undertook to  investigate any cases of alleged victimisation.  As the carters at Bradford resumed work on the 15th November, the strike may now be considered at an  end.     Vehicle Builders (Glasgow). A conference between representatives of  the  Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association and the National Union of Vehicle  Builders, on the 13th November,  arrived at a  settlement  granting advances  of  2d. an hour to semi-skilled workmen, 2\d. an hour to skilled workmen employed on commercial work, and %\d. per hour to  skilled workmen employed on coach-work,  that is, passenger-carrying vehicles. The men resumed work on the 16th November.     Electricians (London). An  agreement has been  arrived  at  between  the  London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union and the National Federated Electrical Association, which gives  80 per  cent,  of  the journeymen&apos;s rate to  auxiliary workmen over 21 years  of age, other than apprentices, employed  in assisting journeymen.  The effect of  this agreement is to bring the rate of electricians&apos; mates in the London district up  to 25.. an hour.     Tramwaymen (Ashton-under-Lyne). It will be remembered  that, in connection with the demand of the tramwaymen at Ashton-under-Lyne for payment under the guaranteed week for loss of time from the date  of the termination of the coal strike,  work was resumed  on the understanding that the claim should be  referred to  the  National Joint Industrial Council for the  Tramways Industry, and that, failing a satisfactory  settlement within seven days, the matter should be settled locally.  As no  decision  was given by the Council within  the time specified, a local  settlement  was made, the  men accepting the employers&apos;  offer of compensatory  payment to cover 50 per cent, of the time lost sincethe 3rd November.

PART   II.-THE   WORK   OF   THE   MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  DEPARTMENT.                  ARBITRATION  AND  CONCILIATION.                                   AWARDS.     The number of awards received during the week was 14, of  which 10 were under the Industrial Courts Act, three under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, as amended by the Industrial Courts Act, and one by a single arbitrator.     Shipbuilders (Clyde). The Court fixed extras to be paid  for template work for shell or tank tops.   (Award No. 530.)     Railway Shopmen (Swindon). The semi-skilled and unskilled railway shopmen were graded in seven classes, with rates varying from 44s. to 30s. per week.   (Award No. 531.)     Organ Builders (Great Britain). An advance of lhd. per hour was awarded by the Court.  (Award No. 535.)     Farriers  (Lancashire,  Cheshire,  North Staffordshire,  West Riding, and  Hull). An advance of It?, per hour was granted by the Court.  (Award  No. 537.)                      AGREEMENTS  AND  SETTLEMENTS.     Sawmillers (Carlisle).. A strike  of sawyers and machinists in sawmills at Carlisle occurred on the 8th September,  the men having been refused  an advance of 2d. per hour on their rate of Is.  lOd. per hour.  From 50 to 60 sawmill labourers were thrown out of employment.   The Chief Conciliation Officer, Newcastle, assisted in the negotiations but no settlement was reached,  as the employers,  while agreeing with  the woodcutting machinists&apos; organiser that an advance of Id. per hour be given, objected to his condition that this should be only an interim advance, and that, at the end of a set period, the rate should be further advanced to  2s. per hour.     Most of the men found work in the building trade, but one employer induced  his men to return at the old rate.   The  men&apos;s organiser then blacklisted the firms where the men had struck.  The employer whose  men had returned retaliated by obtaining  the discharge of three members of the Society of Woodcutting Machinists, who had obtained work at a higher rate in the town.  The organiser then instructed the local representative of the Federation of  Building Trades Operatives, together with the local secretary of the woodcutting machinists&apos; society  and one other, to meet the employers and to make the best terms possible.  The employers granted an advance of Id. per hour on condition that all men on strike, except in one district, should return to work, and that no further strikes should  take place in Carlisle, or  any claims for advances be put forward, until in all the sawmills in Cumberland a uniform minimum rate of Is. 9d. per hour was paid.    As a number of the strikers are working  in the building trade at&apos; 2s. id. per hour it is unlikely that they will return ; and as in Cumberland rates generally are from Is. 3cZ. to Is. 6fdL per hour, it will be a  long time before a further advance can  be claimed if the agreement is observed.  The organiser of the machinists refused to sign the agreement.    Mersey Ship Repair Trade-M.  apprentices were reinstated, and work was generally resumed on the 15th November.*    Shipyard  Painters (Wivenhoe). The National Amalgamated Society of  Operative House and Ship Painters and Decorators made a claim for  increased  wages  on behalf of their  members employed in certain Wivenhoe shipyards. Negotiations with the firms concerned having failed, the  union  requested the department to  arrange  for arbi- tration.   After correspondence with  the  parties,  a further meeting took place at which the union accepted the employers&apos; offer of 3s. per week, to date from the 1st Septemberlast.             * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 19, 6th November, p. 538.(B 16666)
                        COMMITTEES AND CONFERENCES.     Dyers and Finishers (Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire). On the  16th November Sir David Shacldeton met representatives of the trade unions concerned in the present wages claim in the dyeing and bleaching trade.  Representatives of the employers were also in attendance.  After consultations with each party separately, a joint meeting was held, with the Chief Labour Adviser as chairman, at which it was  agreed that,  with certain exceptions, the application generally should be referred to a Court of  Arbitration, consisting of two arbitrators, one to be appointed  by each side, with a third person, to be agreed upon, as umpire.   The question of who should appoint the umpire was a source of trouble.   A list of possible persons was handed to the parties,  and from this a pro- visional selection was made.  The union representatives, however, wish, if their members think fit, to leave it to the arbitrators to select the umpire, and only in  the event of  their disagreement to call upon the Ministry for assistance.  These proposals are to be discussed at meetings of the operatives on the  20th November, with a view to a decision as to which course should be pursued.                      INTERPRETATIONS  AND  RULINGS.     Interpretations of Industrial Court Awards. The Industrial Court sat  to hear the parties regarding an interpretation of Award No. 422 and, although the employers&apos;  asso- ciation did not attend the sitting, an interpretation was issued.  The association protested against this procedure, on the ground that they had not consented as required by Rule 7 of the Industrial Court (Procedure)  Rules.   On this point the Court remarked :            &quot; The Association are under a misapprehension as to the true construction of Rule 7.  The       consent of the parties is required, under Rule 7, to proceed without hearing them, and not otherwise.       Under the rule it is open to any party to an award to apply for a decision on any question of inter-       pretation,  and it is the duty of the Court to decide the matter.  The rule provides two methods       of procedure.  One method is that the Court may decide the matter after hearing the parties; the       other is that the Court may decide the matter without hearing the parties, if the parties to the  award       consent to a hearing being dispensed with.  In the present case the Court  proposed to hear the       parties, and sat for the purpose of hearing them on  the 9th October, and the consent of the Asso-       ciation to the Court deciding the matter of interpretation is not required.&quot;                   QUESTIONS  PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.     Semi-skilled and  Unskilled  Workers in Railway Shops. The Workers&apos; Union and the National Union of  General Workers have made a claim for the application of the higher rates of pay for overtime and night work for semi-skilled and unskilled workers, provided in the agreement with  the  Engineering  and the  National  Employers&apos; Federations, on behalf of their members  employed by the Great Central Railway at  Gorton.  The matter was  taken up with the railway company and  the Negotiating Committee  of General Managers.   The latter intimated  that the question of rates  and conditions of railway shopmen is at present the subject of negotiation with the craft unions  and the National Union of Railwaymen, and that, pending a general  settlement of these negotiations,  it is impossible  to deal with  isolated cases.  The Chief Conciliation Officer,  Manchester, has accordingly been  instructed to communicate this  decision  to the local officials  of the unions.  As  the National Union of  General Workers appear to  be  affiliated to the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, it has been suggested that the union should take the matter  up  with the federation, who  are  a party to the national nego- tiations.     Glass Workers (Liverpool). A strike and lock-out  of glass workers, involving between 200  and 300 workpeople, is in progress in Liverpool.  The  cause  is the refusal of the employers to concede a  demand, made on the 30th June by the Liverpool and District Glass Workers&apos; Industrial Union, to which all the workpeople belong, for an increase of wages of 4d. an hour to all glass workers except embossers, the latter  to receive Id. an hour.  The employers refused on the ground  that,  as  recently as the 1st May, they had granted an increase of 3d. an hour, and that the concession of  such frequent advancesis impossible, as heavy losses are often sustained  on  contracts if they  are granted.  On the 29th October the men decided to strike, withdrawing their labour from one firm at a time, the remainder making a  levy to  support the strikers.   The employers decidedthat, if the strikers did  not  return to work at once, they would lock out the men  fromthe remaining firms,  and gave notices accordingly.  The  men refused to return and thelock-out was declared.   The Chief Conciliation Officer is in touch  with the parties) but so far the employers have refused all offers  of intervention.

The strike of employees of the General Accident, Fire and LifeAssurance Corporation, Ltd., continues. According to a statement issued by the corporationonly 131 out of 691 employees are out,  and business is being carried on as usual.  Thedepartment have again approached the corporation with a view to the  opening of nego-tiations, and the matter is to receive further consideration by the directors.     Pottery Workers (Barnstaple). The  strike of pottery workers at Barnstaple has beenpartially settled.*  Two firms were involved,  Messrs. C. H. Brannan, Ltd., and Mr. W.Baron.    The six labourers on strike from Mr. Baron&apos;s works have been permitted by the union to resume work on the concession of an advance of 5s. per week.   In the case of Messrs.Brannan negotiations  are proceeding, but no  settlement has been reached/although theunion  have considerably modified their original.demand for an all-round increase of 20per cent.                          INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS.                     JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS.Reports.     Cablemaking. The Council  met on the 17th  November, and  settled that the bonusrecently granted to  young girls was awarded to time-workers only, but that such firmsas have paid the bonus to piece-workers  should be asked to continue to do so.    The increased rate to jointers employed by the Cable  Makers&apos; Association in theHome  Counties area was ante-dated to the 1st October ; it was decided not to await thedecision of  the Electricity Supply Council on the same subject.    The &quot;firms outside the  Cable Makers&apos; Association have formed an association, andare resisting payment  of the rates agreed by the Council.  &apos; The members  of the associationhave urged the trade unions to enforce payment of the full rate.    Electricity Supply. The East Midlands District Council met on the 18th November.The chairman and vice-chairman for the ensuing year were appointed, as also  were repre-sentatives to the proposed national conference of representatives of the District Councilsconcerned in the industry.    The National  Council met on the 19th November.  A  recommendation was  madein respect of a difference  as to the adoption of a schedule of rates of pay, referred to theCouncil by the District Council  for the Eastern Counties.  It was decided  that a con-ference of  representatives of the District Councils for the industry be  held in london on the 20th January.   It was stated on behalf of the trade union side that the applicationfor an increase of wages, to which reference was made at  the last meeting, would be deferred pending the  result of negotiations in \he engineering and shipbuilding trades.    Flour Milling. The  secretary of the Council was interviewed on the 17th Novemberwith reference to a meeting on the 18th November of a sub-committee of  the Flour Millers&apos;Federation, appointed to consider the utility of a &quot; Whitley &quot;  Council to the trade.   Onthe 18th November the sub-committee  met, and invited an officer of the department tobe present, in order to state the department^ opinion of the work already done by theCouncil, and whether, in the event of  a number  of country millers resigning from theemployers&apos; federation, the department would consider that the Council no longer repre-sented the industry.   Apparently there is considerable dissatisfaction  among the  smallmillers of  the Midlands and East Anglia against  the wages settlement reached by theCouncil.  They consider  that they would be better placed by  withdrawing from thefederation, and paying their own rates of wages.   It was emphasised at the meeting thatthe only protection of these small millers lay in the possible  weakness of the  trade union organisation in some  areas,  &quot;and that, where organisation was  strong, they would be nobetter off.   As the unions are strongly in favour of continuing the Council, it was  to be presumed that they would do their best, by improving their organisation, to enforce the wage agreements reached in the Council.   It was intimated  that the  department held that the Council has worked in the most satisfactory manner, and that, unless the defectionof  the small millers made the Council  not really representative,  it was not consideredprobable that the question of withdrawing recognition would arise.    Glass. A meeting of the special sub-committee appointed to deal  with the questionof anti-dumping legislation was  held on the 18th  November.   It was decided, as regardsthe protection of key industries, to press upon  the Government the necessity for the
  inclusion of optical, scientific and essential illuminating glassware.  With regard to anti-  dumping, the sub-committee intend to define their attitude at a later meeting.      Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). The  executive committee of the District Council for the Northern Home Counties met on the  18th November.  The employers&apos; side reported that steps were  being taken, by means  of conferences of local authorities, to secure greater support  for the Council.  It  was  decided to  collect information,  in order that a scheme  of rates  of pay  for the various  grades of workpeople employed by local authorities in the area might be formulated.      The executive committee of the South Midlands District  Council met  on the  19th  November,  and considered the claim of the trade union side for an all-round increase of  20 per cent, on the  minimum rates fixed in May  last.   It was  decided to recommend  that an immediate advance of one-twelfth on present gross rates be granted, and that  a sliding scale be instituted providing  for periodic adjustments  as the cost of living rises  or falls.      Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle  and Allied Trades. The  Council met  on the  16th  November.   A committee was  appointed to  consider the possibility of formulating a  special scheme for contracting out of  the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  A dis-  cussion took place on the question of shop rents, the trade union representatives  con-  tending that the practice should be abolished, now that the custom of a workman taking  work from more than one employer was practically obsolete.  No decision was arrived at.  The executive committee are to consider the possibility  of preparing a monthly trade  report.      Printing. All the unions except the Typographical Association have now balloted  in favour of accepting the provisional  agreement made between the master printers and  the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation,  by which men receive an additional 5s.  per  week,  and women 2s. per week.   The ballot of the Typographical Association  is not  yet  completed, but it is  said that there will be a majority in favour of accepting the same  terms.  Employers  in London have been instructed by the London Master  Printers&apos;  Association  to pay the increase this week.      An  agreement  was  negotiated between  the master  printers&apos; association and the  Amalgamated Type Founders&apos; Trade Society  on the 29th October, respecting the wages  to be paid to journeymen in charge of monotype casters.  The  London Master Printers&apos;  Association  have also made  a new agreement with the  London  Printing and Kindred  Trades Federation, still further restricting overtime.      Tramway. A special meeting of the Council was held on the 17th November to  consider further the claim submitted by,the  trade union side  for immediate advances  of 12s. per week to all employees of 18 and over, and 6s. per week to youths  under  18.  On the employers&apos; side only the municipal  undertakings were represented.  A  report prepared by the  secretary of the Municipal  Tramways  Association and the  secretary of the trade union side was  received,  respecting the increased  cost of living  compared with the increased wages or  bonuses paid to the various classes  of employees, the  Wages paid to tramway employees and other classes of comparable occupation, and the financial position of the various undertakings.  The situation  was fully discussed.   It was decided that both sides should report the proceedings to their constituents, and should put before them the question of referring the claim to arbitration, and that  a further meeting should be held not  later than the 7th December.     Waterworks Undertakings. The first meeting of the South Midlands District Council was held on the 16th November..  A Grading and Rating Sub-Committee was formed, and a provisional notice of motion was given by the trade, union  side  for an immediate increase of 7s. Qd.  per week  for all waterworks employees in the district, pending  the grading and  rating of such employees by the District Council.     Silk. The President of the Board  of Trade received  a deputation from the Council on the 17th November, on the subject of the serious disabilities under which the industry is suffering owing to the unrestricted importation of silk fabrics.   Mr. F.  J. Farrell pointed out that  owing to the collapse of continental exchanges, and the closure of continental markets by tariffs and prohibition, silk  fabrics  were being marketed in this country at a price with which  the industry could not compete, while the industry was  excluded from foreign markets.   The result  was considerable under-employment  and  an increasing amount  of unemployment.  The  workpeople&apos;s representatives  emphasised the serious position in respect  of  short time  and unemployment.  The deputation suggested that,to assist the  industry  temporarily, there should be imposed  either a restriction of silk
 imports, or a sumptuary duty on imported silk fabrics as articles of luxury.  The President promised his careful consideration of their representations.     Wrought Hollow-ware. The Council met on the 17th November to consider further the application for an advance in wages, consolidation of war bonus and percentages, and an annual fortnightV holiday with pay, discussed without  result on the 19th October. The employers refused to grant any advance  in wages, but were willing to go into the matter of consolidation.  They required more time  to  consider the  holiday question. Thereupon the labour side announced that they wished to refer their whole claim to a Court of Arbitration, and the Council  adjourned to allow the employers to consider the proposal.     Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales).  A further joint conference was held on the 16th November to consider the establishment of a  District Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire.  The constitution drawn up by the Drafting committee was adopted.

Local Authorities&apos; Administrative,  Technical  and Clerical Services  (Scotland). The Council met  on the 16th November.  It was announced  that early decisions Would be taken by the County Councils  Associations, the Association of Education Authorities, and the Glasgow Corporation, as to whether they would support the Joint Council.  Con- sideration was given to proposals to set up District or Provincial Councils and local com- mittees, which will be further considered at the next meeting. Miscellaneous.     Loch, Latches  and  Keys. At a special meeting of  the Midland Lock  and Latch Manufacturers&apos; Association,  on the 17th November, it was decided to resolve the existing Wages Board into a Joint Industrial Council.  The first meeting of the Council will be held early in December.     Brewing. The District Council for the North Midland Area met on the 3rd November. The sub-committee&apos;s report on  classification of  district and. minimum wages was read It was agreed that Beeston and Daybrook should be transferred to Grade A, and that Newark should remain Grade B.    The Council also decided the following grades : Grade A, minimum 64s., increase 6s., total  70s.; Grade B, minimum  60s., increase 6s., total 66s.;  Grade C,  minimum, 57s.,  increase 6s., total 63s.   It was  further agreed that the increased wage should not prejudice any employee now receiving more than the total on the hour&apos;s work.  These  rates will be retrospective from the 1st October, except where an agreement is  in force to a later date. Works Committees.     Flour M.illing.-r ]ie works committee delegates&apos; meeting for  the  North-Western District have decided to  call for reports from the individual works committees, to  review the whole position, and  in the light of the experience gained, to determine the attitude of the employees&apos; side towards this portion  of the Whitley Report.     Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. The Sheffield master silversmiths have decided that the question of works committees is  a  purely domestic concern, and the chairman of the association has suggested to the Ministry that an  officer should call on the leading manufacturers and explain the  scheme.     Paper Making. The Employers&apos; Federation of Paper Makers have adopted  a new constitution,  which gives greater power to the three divisions into which the Federation is divided.  Each division Can negotiate wages  separately.  This fact adds importance to the opposition of the Southern Division to a Joint Industrial Council on which the general unions are represented.

The Special Rates Committee considered questions as to the minimum rates appro-priate to hemp rollers and hemp breakers, and of the units of work appropriate to femaleweavers, and agreed that the former question be referred to the Board, and the latter question be again considered by the committee.  It was further agreed to recommend theBoard not to fix general minimum piece-rates for female canvas weavers.    Ready-Made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great  ntam).-The Boardagreed to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-workbasis time-rates and overtime rates for male and female Workers, and at the same time towithdraw the Notice of Proposal, dated the 2nd October, to vary minimum rates in theapplication to certain classes of male workers, as the proposed variation is merged in thepresent proposals.

Rates for male workers, 21 years       of age and over, employed as hydraulic pressers, slitters, stock-keepers, packers and despatchers,       range from Is. i\d.  to Is. b\d. per hour,  according to the length of service.   For all other male       workers, other than learners between 14  and 21, for whom the rates are lower according to age,       the rate is Is. i\d. per hour; for female  workers, other than  learners, 9 cZ. per hour, with lower       rates for female learners.   The piece-work basis time-rate  for all female workers is  9fcL per hour.           The overtime rates as varied for male and female workers  are, for time-workers,  for overtime       on any day  except Sunday and  customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter for       the first two hours and time-and-a-half for the second two hours;  for all time worked on Sunday       and customary public and statutory holidays, and for all overtime after 4  hours&apos; overtime on any       other day, double time ; for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except       where higher overtime rates are payable.           For piece-workers, the overtime rates are made up of the sum  of piece-rates, each of which       would yield to an  ordinary worker not  less than the general minimum time-rate in the case of male       workers, including learners, or not less than the piece-work basis time-rate in the case of female       workers, including learners, and the whole of, one-half of,  or one-quarter of, the following amounts,       according  as the overtime rates payable if the worker had been employed on time-work would have       been double time, time-and-a-half or time-and-a-quarter;  (a) an amount equal to the appropriate       general minimum  time-rate, in the case of all male workers, including learners, and in the case of       female learners;   (6) an amount equal to the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate, in the case       of female  workers, other than learners.                      * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 7,  14th August, p. 256.

The general minimum time-rates, as varied, are Is. Id. per hour for male cutters, 22 years of        age and over, employed wholly or mainly in cutting, and of not less than 5 years&apos; experience in cutting        in the wholesale dressmaking and women&apos;s light clothing trade, and lOfdl. per hour for female workers,        22 years of age and over, of not less than 3 years&apos; experience in the retail bespoke dressmaking trade        as fully qualified bodice, skirt, gown or blouse  hands.  The piece-work basis time-rates for these        classes of male and female workers are Is. %\d. and llfd. per hour, respectively.            The overtime rates as varied are calculated on the above minimum rates for hours worked in        excess of the declared normal number of hours of work, in the same manner as the overtime rates        at present in  operation.     Grocery and Provisions Trade  Board (England  and Wales). The  Board have issued a notice of  Proposal, dated  the 16th November, to fix  general  minimum time-rates  forcertain classes of female workers.

General Outlook &quot;While  reports from  the Divisional Controllers indicate a  quickrecovery in those industries  where  activity had been suspended  owing to the  failureof coal supplies, there is little evidence of  reaction in those industries which, for some considerable time past, have been reported  as suffering from acute trade depression.    Shipbuilding  and other  Industries. It is reported from Scotland that the principalcauses of unemployment among shipbuilders are  a shortage  of  material  and the can-cancellation of orders.  On the Tyne the position is regarded as improving, a  large numberof workmen having been engaged during the week.  Work in  the ship-repairing trade isalso fairly brisk, and there is sufficient work  on hand to last for  some weeks.   The position on the Wear and the Tees is not so  favourable, as the firms who carried on during thecoal strike are now feeling the effect of the break in the continuity of supplies of material.In the South Wales district employment on ship-repairing  work at Barry, Bute Docks,Newport and Swansea is fairly good, and the position is likely to remain firm for some little time.  The  situation in the Liverpool district is regarded as more promising now that a settlement  has been arrived at in the shipwrights&apos; trade  dispute, and  it is expectedthat the general resumption of work which is expected to follow, even  if operations are on a restricted scale,  will greatly ease the  serious unemployment in this district.    In the  North-Western Division employment  in  the engineering  industry  is fairgenerally, but varies in its various branches ;  the textile machinery branch, for instance,is very busy, but  the motor branch is seriously depressed.  There is as yet no evidence  ofan improvement in the cotton industry, but a more  hopeful  tone is discernible  in thereports from such important centres  as Blackburn and Burnley.  Systematic short time is still being worked in the textile and lace trades,  and there appears to be little prospectat present of the  return of normal conditions.  The report from Leicester indicates thata more hopeful tone obtains in the hosiery trade, although short time is still the rule ratherthan the exception.   Northampton report a slight improvement in the position  of thelarge boot and shoe manufacturers, but the smaller manufacturers are working less timeper week, or suspending operations entirely.  In the pottery trade the outlook is favour-able, and it is anticipated that the good conditions prevailing  before the coal strike willbe restored during the  next  week or two.   With  the approach  of Christmas, and the resumption of normal conditions following on the strike, there is a prospect of a fair demandfor industrial workers in the City of London.    Industrial Developments. At Tintagel  the Trevellet Slate Quarries,  which  closedsome months ago, have re-opened.  Norwich report that  there are definite prospects of200 unskilled workers being required for a new jam factory.  At  Berwick-on-Tweed anew steel factory is to be built in the near future.    (B 16666)                                                             4K
      Labour Reductions. Woking report that Messrs. Martinsyde, Ltd., who have been  standing off about 800 men, have now definitely decided to discharge  500 workpeople.  About 80 clerks at present employed in the Army Pay Office are under notice.  They are  mostly ex-Service men, but will not be suitable for submission to the Joint Substitution  Board, as  they have not served  overseas.    Messrs. J. I. Thornycroft &amp; Sons, Ltd.,  Basingstoke, have effected considerable reductions in their staff, and some fifty men from  these works have registered at the Reading  Exchange.  At Worcester 50 men employed  as solderers by a local firm have been dismissed owing to trade depression.  It is probable  that, when trade  revives, this work  will be performed by female labour. Messrs. .D.  Colville &amp; Sons, Ltd., Glengarnock, who  have large stocks of iron and steel on hand, have  discharged 100 steel workers.      Shortage of Labour. The situation in regard to the  building trade has not altered to  any  appreciable extent.   Both in  London and in the provinces the scarcity  of  skilled  building operatives is as acute as ever, and  orders for bricklayers, plasterers and joiners  are practically impossible to fill.  There is also an unsatisfied demand for ironmoulders.  Not  less than  100 workmen of this trade are  required by Messrs. Hardie  and Gordon, Dumbarton, and, until they are procured, no further addition can be made to the number  of unskilled workers.     Shortage of Material. Considerable unemployment  is reported in Johnstone owing to the shortage of castings.  At Glasgow, Messrs. D. Bennie &amp; Sons, Ltd., have been com- pelled to close down one of their hoop mills owing&apos;to the shortage of raw materials. Women&apos;s Employment.     General Situation. The reports from the divisions still appear generally to suggest that  the effect  of the coal strike, as far as women are concerned, has been very  much less  marked than might have  been  expected.  Trade depression continues,  and  a marked increase in the  number of unemployment books lodged is shown, but this  is felt to be due to causes already in operation before the strike.     Local Reports. A more hopeful note is struck in the North-Western Division, although short time is still being worked to a great extent in the textile industry:  A number of mills are re-starting, and in the Blackburn area, for example, there is an improvement in trade all round.   Improvement  is also reported in  the Burnley  and Glossop districts.  At Middleton, Pendlebury, Radcliffe, Royton and Shaw the spinning mills  are all working full time.  At Bolton, however, mills are now working shorter hours or are limiting their workers to two or three  looms instead of four.  The tailoring and sewing trades at Black- pool are slack, and continued depression in the wholesale clothing, shirt and underclothing industries is reported from Crewe.    The depression in the  staple industries of the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division continues, more especially in the textile, woollen, hosiery, lace, clothing and boot and shoe trades.  General short time is being worked.    At Sutton-in-Ashfield  the  hosiery trade  is almost at a standstill.  At  Beeston 500 lace workers are either under-employed or unemployed.  At Mansfield short time is being worked in all factories and mills, some working only half a day a week.    From Hebden Bridge it is reported that the local cotton manufacturers have decided to work 30  hours per week for the remainder  of November.  Another  economy  has been to reduce a number of six-loom  weavers to four looms.  At Halifax it is stated that  manytextile factories are discharging married women in order to keep the single women employed at least 24 hours per week.    The South  Midlands and Eastern Division also  report slackness in the majority ofthe staple industries. At  Northampton the  number of boot operatives  out of work is increasing ;  at Wellingborough the majority of boot firms are on short time.  At Leicester,while one or two firms  have resumed full-time work,  most  are  only working  half-time. The position in the clothing trade is very serious at Kettering, and depression continuesmarked at  Colchester.    In Leicester the hosiery trade, in the athletic departments, are  working full time,but the plain hosiery and underwear sections are on half-time or three-quarter  time. The silk industry is depressed both at Braintree and Norwich.   The Spirella Corset Co.,Letchworth, are on short time.    Although trade depression continues  to be reported from the West Midlands Divisionreports are slightly more satisfactory.   The pottery trade appears to be reviving rapidly
 after the strike.  At Burton-on-Trent the situation is said to  be fairly normal and the tailoring trade is brisker.   At Cannock and Tipton, brick workers suspended during the strike are now returning.  There is still marked unemployment in Coventry, where 1,100 women are claiming unemployment insurance  benefit.  General depression in the tin goods, leather and other trades is reported from Worcester, Dudley and Oldbury.     The depression in the London area continues, and very high live registers are reported from many Exchanges.  At Shepherds Bush the live register is 1,000, and more than half this number are claiming unemployment insurance benefit;  at Bermondsey over 2,000  women  are  registered ;  at  Shoreditch the  live  register is over  1,000. The depression in  the clothing trade remains very marked.     Shepherds Bush report that Messrs. Buszards  have  engaged 117 women for the catering trade ab the White City.  Leyton state a large corrugated paper factory is being erected near to the Exchange.  The firm have agreed to engage all workers through the Exchange.   At Sheerness a number of women are  registered  for the new  glass  works at Queenborough.     General depression is reported from the South-Western Division.   The clothing trade remains slack at Bristol and Swindon.  The gloving industry is showing signs of slackness at Yeovil and Barnstaple.   At Barnstaple, however,  the shirt and collar trade is brisk. The lace industry in this town is slack ;  a firm employing over 400  workers are closing down.  Over 150 fresh  women have registered at Gloucester during  the week, many of whom are married women whose husbands are out of employment.     In the Northern Division the few Women&apos;s industries appear to be slack.  At New- castle the register increased by 300  during the week.  The ropery works continue slack at Sunderland and at Willington Quay, but those at Hebburn-on-Tyne have resumed a five-day week.     Slackness in the staple women&apos;s  industries is reported from Scotland.  Bridgeton report slackness in the textile trades,  which is ascribed to the conditions of the money market in the countries to  which goods are normally exported.  At Galashiels, trade in the woollen mills is slack, but there is little unemployment.   At Dunfermline, work in the linen factories is very quiet.  At Dumfries the expected decrease of the price of woollen goods is said to be leading  to greater  slackness in the weaving and glove  factories than would otherwise be the case at this season.  At Irvine the hosiery  trade is still fairly slack, and at Kilmarnock there is said to be serious depression in all the textile factories. The  hosiery and lace factories  are also  on short time.  At  Kirkcaldy several spinning mills are working short  time.  At Leven the Boase Spinning Co.,  Ltd., and  a large firm of linen manufacturers,  are on short time, 800 women and girls being affected.   At Dundee the jute mills  are only working three days a week.  The rubber trade is said to be slack in Glasgow, and general industrial depression is reported from this district.     The situation in Wales now appears to be normal.      OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE BENEFIT.     Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 11th November, show 76,238 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  93,406 12s. 4d.     Unemployment Insurance Benefit. The payments of unemployment insurance benefit made during the week ending the  5th November  was 86,831, involving an amount of  45,160 19s. lid.                               JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.     Employment of Boys in the Mercantile Marine, A useful system of co-operation is maintained between the Newport Juvenile Advisory Committee and the  local superin-tendent of the Board of Trade, whereby boys waiting for ships-are referred to the committee. The  committee place the boys in temporary work, so far as possible, but those not placedhave to report daily to  the  office of the Board of Trade.   There are sometimes as many as 20 boys waiting for ships, and in one case four months elapsed before the boy securedanother berth.    Apprenticeship (Building).-As the result  of the activities of the Hereford JuvenileAdvisory Committee, a  scheme of apprenticeship has been adopted by the local buildingtrades.  The scheme is almost identical with that recommended by the Industrial Council.    (B 16666)                                                            4 K 2
APPOINTMENTS   AND  TRAINING.    APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL  LIABILITIES  DEPARTMENT.                                   GENERAL.    Business Training Scheme. Authority has been received for  a business training scheme designed to provide for ex-Service applicants training which will fit them for busi-ness appointments.  Ex-officers and men  who served in the late war &quot;will be eligible ifthey are unemployed and  have little  prospect  of  employment.  These conditions  ofeligibility are irrespective of age, length of war service, or date of demobilisation.    Grants for  maintenance will be at a &quot;flat rate, with allowances for men living away from home  and for those who  are married.   The last date of application will be the 30thApril, 1921, unconditionally and finally.  The length of training will be limited  to oneyear.  The essence of the scheme is that an employer  who accepts  a trainee will give an honourable undertaking to employ him on the completion of his training for at least one year, and at a salary of not less than  4 per week.   The trainee, at the same time,will also give an honourable  undertaking to  stay  with the  firm, should  he be foundsuitable.  Efforts are  being made to direct public attention to this scheme by every means possible, and applications are now being received.    Obligation Week.-During Obligation Week special efforts were made in all districts to bring the needs of the department to the notice of employers generally.  Special posterswere exhibited in theatres and in prominent positions in towns.   Letters and articles wereinserted in the  Press.   Pamphlets were enclosed in, programmes, or  were placed on alltables in hotels, restaurants and clubs.   In many towns the managers of cinemas gave their assistance, and had special slides made for the occasion.  In Wolverhampton the managerof the principal cinema gave nightly on the screen the qualifications of at least one officer or man, and asked the audience whether they could place him.                                APPOINTMENTS.    Statistics.-During the week ending the 12th November, the Appointments Depart-ment placed 455 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidatesknown to have been placed to  44,701.   Of these, 6,083 were placed through the agency ofThe  wages laid  down for Hereford vary,  according to age, from 15 per cent,  of  thejourneyman&apos;s rate for apprentices  of 14 years,  to 65  per  cent, for  those of 20 years.Several boys have already been apprenticed in accordance with the scheme.    Juvenile Delinquents.-^^ Deptford Juvenile Advisory Committee have  arranged with the local newspapers that the names of juvenile delinquents should not be published in their reports.  This question came up for discussion at a recent meeting of the chairmen and secretaries of the London  committees.  Several other committees are endeavouringto make similar arrangements.    Vacancies [London).-k report  presented to the London (Central) Juvenile AdvisoryCommittee shows that, though,  considering the difficulties of the time, the type of vacancyfilled has been satisfactory, there has been a general decrease in the number offering definiteprospects  of apprenticeship.  The  lack of vacancies in the staple occupations  in  thecentral areas is being severely felt in the outlying and residential districts.  The increased cost of travel makes application for employment at a distance from home, when the chanceof success  is doubtful, a very serious consideration.    Club for Boys in Hotels. A long-felt want has been supplied by the opening of a clubfor boys engaged in the West End hotel service.  The  club, which is open to  all boys,between 14 and  18, working in clubs or hotels, is called the  Westminster Boys&apos; Club.The club premises are in Trafalgar  Square, and are open every week-day from 2.30 p.m.to 6 p.m.   The  Great Marlborough Street  Juvenile Advisory Committee have  arranged to send to the Rev. E.  M. Guilford, the superintendent  of the  club,  the names andaddresses of all boys placed in clubs and hotels, and to urge the boys to join the club.

The Director at Perth reports that there has recently beena great demand for information regarding vacancies abroad.  A large number of theseinquiries are from men who have been unemployed for some time.    The  Director at Manchester  reports that the Liverpool Rotary  Club have nowsucceeded in  finding  employment for 50 candidates.  Arrangements have been made forthe display of a short list of candidates on the notice  boards at the Liverpool Corn and produce Exchange, and members have promised to make personal efforts on behalf ofthe men.    The Director at Cambridge reports that the members of the Luton Panel have com-menced the collection of a fund of  100, for the purpose of refunding travelling and other expenses, to candidates for whom it would be a hardship  to pay their own fares.  At thelast meeting three of the candidates were paid immediately after the interview.    At the general meeting of district members of the Federation of British Industiresheld in Leicester on the  3rd November, it was stated that the staple industries  in thedistrict were in a worse state at the moment than for many years past.    The Controller of the Appointments and Training  Branch, Ireland, reports that thedepression in the linen trade  is still  marked,  and that to assist the  smaller firms it isproposed to form a corporation.  The committee concerned with this matter have askedfor the assistance of the  department in finding a general manager, whose salary, if theright man can be obtained, will be fixed at a minimum of  2,000 per annum.  The Sealof Honour is being increasingly adopted  by Northern firms, particularly since  it hasbecome understood that  registration  under  the Scheme  is taken into account, in the.allocation of Government contracts.                  BUSINESS  AND  PROFESSIONAL  TRAINING.    Maintenance  and  Training Grants  Scheme. During the week  ending  the 12thNovember the Appointments Department received 90 applications for  training  underthis  scheme,  of  which 50 were  for training of the type provided by the department.Deducting  cancellations and withdrawals,  28,245 applications for training of this typehave been received in all, and 50,180 for training of the types provided by other Govern-ment departments.

The weekly statistics  are again fairly satisfactory, though the number of men placed.in training shows a slight falling off.  During the past four weeks, however,  the waiting.

  Appointments  and  Training-continued..  list has been reduced by 99 names only;  for the past six months the average for a similar  period has been in the neighbourhood of 1,200.  In round numbers, the waiting list stood  on the  1st January at 27,000, on the 1st March at 28,000, on the 1st  May at 24,000, on  the 1st  July at 22,500, on the 1st September at 20,500, and on the 1st November at 17,500.  In the  8 months since March a  steady reduction  has been made, amounting to about  36 per  cent., but since  the middle of October there has been a slight tendency towards  an increase.      The  number of  fresh candidates  added to the  waiting  list during October  was  considerably in excess of that for September, and  this fact may indicate an increase of  unemployment among disabled men.  The number of men on the waiting list accepted  by Local Technical  Advisory Committees, or approved for admission to a non-special  trade, was considerably lower than the corresponding figure  at the  end of September.  This may be due in part to the fact that the Local Technical Advisory Committees for  certain trades have already closed their lists, or are beginning to close them.     Influence of Divisional Directors. A conference of Divisional Directors was held at  Montagu House on the 16th November, under the presidency of the Minister.     On the question of  the length of courses, the general opinion was  expressed that,  from  the technical  point of view, it  is  undesirable to continue  a man&apos;s  stay in a  Government Instructional Factory longer than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of instructional training, though immediate conditions might render it necessary in certain cases  to  modify this rule was discussed in detail.  In a good many cases extensions were recommended of the length of the courses for the special trades.     The opinion Was expressed that the present waiting lists may in a general sense be accepted as of  a &quot; live &quot; character.  It was suggested that the  present labourers wage, which appears  high  when contrasted  with the  training  allowance, tends  to  diminish applications, which are likely, however, to increase as it is discovered that the occupations taken up are of a blind-alley nature.  The question of the adequacy of the training allow- ances arose, and a proposal for an increased bonus was very generally approved.     In connection with the arrangements for local purchase,  the Minister promised to appoint  a committee consisting of representatives of the  Training and Finance Depart- ments, and the Office of Works, including a representative Divisional Director,  to report upon the present practice, and to consider suggestions made at the conference.     The  conference were of opinion that, with the exception of engineering, in regard to which special conditions  obtain, and of the building trade, there is in general little ground for complaint as to the action of Local Technical Advisory Committees in regard to  the number  of men admitted.  Present difficulties with regard to  the finding of improvers&apos; vacancies were  very fully discussed, and it Was agreed  that, to  deal effectively with this matter, some strengthening of local staffs was necessary.    The  conference Was  supplemented two days later by a conference of managers ofGovernment Instructional Factories,  at which  the Minister again presided.   Most of  the questions raised at the previous meeting were further discussed.from the factory point of view.    Hostels,  Canteens  and Welfare. In  Sarisbury  Court  and-Claydon,  the  two resi- dential  factories, more  than half the  accommodation  is filled.  The department  are responsible for 11 hostels, including the Birtley group.   Over 60 per cent, of the available accommodation has been taken up.    Seven canteens are directly administered by  the department, and three canteens at government Instructional Factories are carried on without responsibility to the Ministry. Fourteen mess-room schemes are now in working order, or will shortly be started, and.16 schemes for hostels, residential factories and  canteens are under consideration.    The United Services Fund have made a grant of  150 to the Spring Bank  Factory,Hull, for additional recreative facilities.    Government Instructional Factories. There are  now over 8,000 men in training in Government Instructional Factories, and 11,500 places will in due course be available fortraining.  Of these only about one-third can be said to be live vacancies at the moment;the remainder  will become available as  factory  schemes  develop and equipment  andconstructional Work is completed.    The manager of  the Chiswick Factory has  tendered  for building eight houses  for disabled  soldiers, in connection with the Chiswick War Memorial Scheme, and the LocalTechnical Advisory Committee have agreed that this  Work be  carried out by men intraining.
    At Birtley the manager has received, from a local firm, a trial order for the manufactureof window frames, and hopes to secure further orders of a similar nature.    Equipment  and Supplies. Financial sanction has been received for the expenditureof  19,000 on the purchase of tailors&apos; materials, and an order has been placed with H.M.Office of Works.    National Trade  Advisory  Committees:  Wholesale Tailoring. A meeting  of  theAdministrative  Committee of the Trade Board, sitting as the National Trade AdvisoryCommittee, was held on the 17th November, to reconsider  the adequacy of  employers&apos;payments, the classification of processes, and the periods of training allowed in the Report.Consideration was  adjourned for a period not exceeding 6 months, within which  periodit was confidently expected that some forecast as to the future of the industry could bemade.    Local Technical Advisory Committees :  Bespoke Tailoring. At the inaugural meetingof the Coventry Local Technical Advisory Committee on the 12th November, the schemeof training was  well received, and it was agreed to train up to 50 men.    Local  Technical  Advisory  Committees:   EngineeringTechnical  AdvisoryCommittees are being set  up  for Barrow, Warrington, Preston, Liverpool, Peterborough,Grantham, Nottingham, Chesterfield, Burton and Slough.    Local Technical  Advisory  Committees:   Gold, Silver  and Allied Trades. At  theinaugural  meeting of the  Reading Local Technical Advisory Committee  for watch  andclock repairing, on the 12th November, both the employers and the operatives welcomed the training scheme, and unanimously decided to commence  at once with  a  class for tenmen.Apprenticeships Interrupted by  Service.    Statistics. Up to the  17th November, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect  of 44,827 apprentices under  the 41 schemes  approved.   Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 42,868 apprentices,  employed by  16,962  employers.  The totalnumber of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, orby mutual agreement between the parties, is now 13,477.    Wages. Attention has been drawn from time to time to the objections raised to the wage rates under the Scheme.   Their numbers are  large;  but caution is  necessary in estimating their importance.  The objections, in many cases, have  resulted from puremisunderstanding, though in not a few cases employers have adopted  the scheme withoutinforming themselves as to the conditions,  and have then refused to carry them  out.Bearing this qualification in mind, it is now possible  to analyse the nature and causes ofthe objections.    First, they are sometimes found to possess a local character.  Cases in  which  this istrue of the whole of a district or of an important town are not common.  Perhaps the mostdefinite instance is afforded by the opposition in Scotland to certain schemes, particularly the building, the electrical contracting, and, to a less degree, the engineering schemes.Opposition of this kind seems to have been less marked in England, the nearest approach to it being in certain town of the extreme South-West;  and there have also been one ortwo instances of objections by individual industries in particular places.     The opposition of  country towns and  rural  districts to the wage  provisions  hasperhaps been even more marked in the west and south-west of England than in otherparts of the United Kingdom, though it has been present in all.  It is especially noticeableamong the smaller firms, but is by no means confined to  them.   Apprentices&apos; wages inthese areas are  generally low, and the smaller employers often have real difficulty in paying the required rates.     These difficulties are also influenced by the weakness of industrial  organisation.This has a double effect.   By keeping down the normal level of wages, it increases the additions to be made under the scheme, and renders employers still more unwilling topay them. Moreover, the weakness of the trade unions, and the fact that the employersconcerned are not members of an association, make it even harder to bring the employersinto line.     There are  indications that objections  are most numerous  under  schemes  which provide for higher wage rates than the minima necessary to qualify for State grant.  Theyseem specially  frequent, for instance, in engineering,  building, and electrical contracting,though exceptions to this tendency are  found, among others, in the two  ironfoundingschemes.
     Certain special influences may be referred to, such as  difficulties in fixing the pre- scribed rate, which especially affects firms employing non-union labour, in proportion asthey are paying below the standard rates.  Sometimes they become liable to pay theapprentices as  much, or more than, the journeymen, and in one or two  instances thisappears to have resulted in increasing the wages of the latter.     Training in Operation. The Chief Local Officer for  the West Midlands  area has beenco-opted a member of the appropriate committee of the  National Joint Industrial council for the Pottery  Industry.  Difficult  questions  arose regarding the  application of thearrangements for apprentices on piece-work to the scheme for this industry.  These arebeing dealt with, on behalf of the industry, by the committee in question, in conjunctionwith the Chief Local Officer.General Training.    Apprenticeship (Building). Consideration of  the national  scheme is  proceeding atCroydon, where efforts are being made to secure a joint conference of employers and work-people.   The local Federation of Master Builders at Penrith have held a special meeting to discuss it.  At Hull both masters and men are considering the scheme, but difficulties have arisen in regard to wages.  Master builders are refusing to pay the lower scale agreedupon by the Yorkshire  Building Trade Centre Joint Council, and the trade unions con-cerned are threatening a strike  where  this attitude  is adopted.   At Brighton,  theformation of a joint committee is being considered.  Many  boys are prepared to enter the industry, but as the local housing scheme has been contracted for by firms outside thedistrict, local builders are short of employment.    Training of Boys  in Ironmoulding (Wales). At Cardiff, where there is  a shortage  of skilled moulders, the boys entering the industry are said to be generally of a low order.Unlike engineers&apos; and patternmakers&apos; apprentices, who  are  of a better class and attendtechnical schools regularly,  they  have no wish for instruction,  and are not encouraged by the foremen.  Moreover,  there is no agreed rate of apprentices&apos; wages, and no definitesystem of training.  The moulders will not be bothered to teach boys their trade.   Manyof them, have to find other employment after a few weeks.   A prominent local employer,in consequence, advocated a revival of indentured apprenticeship, the boys to enter thetrade at 14; and a proposal has been put forward to establish  a small foundry in con-nection with the Cardiff Technical College, for purposes of instruction.   A local firm havealready promised financial support to this latter proposal.    Tinplate Works (Wales).-In this Eeport of last week, on p. 598, the second and thirdparagraphs under the heading Tinplate Works (Wales) refer to steel works in Wales and tothe nut and bolt industry, respectively.

Appendix.                         QUESTIONS IN  PARLIAMENT.  The following  extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House ofCommons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Building  Trade Dilution.    Sir William Davison asked the Minister of Labour if he will inform the House for how many  months he has been in negotiation with the trade unions concerned  with thebuilding trade in order to secure dilution, whereby 50,000 unemployed men, mostly ex-Service men, may obtain immediate employment;  whether there are,  approximately,this number fewer men employed in the building trade than before the war ; and whether,having regard to  the urgency of the problem of unemployment at the present time, he will see that the negotiations are completed without further delay.    Dr. Addison:  I would refer my hon.  and learned friend to the reply given on the8th instant to the hon. and gallant member for Henley.  The number of skilled men now employed in the building trade is, approximately, 60,000 less than before the war.    Sir W. Davison :  Is the right hon. gentleman aware that these negotiations have been going on for nearly a year, and that members of this House are daily receiving deputationsfrom  their  constituents with  regard  to the unemployment  of  ex-Service  men.   Doeshe not think that the time has now arrived when these 50,000 men for whom employment is available in the building trade should be employed without further delay.    Dr. Addison: I entirely agree,   (nth November.)Trade Boards Acts.    Mr. Kiley asked the Minister of Labour what qualifications are necessary for appoint-ment as investigator under the Trade Boards Acts.    Dr. Macnamara :  As my hon. friend is perhaps aware, I  have  decided, as a measureof economy, to amalgamate the inspectors appointed under the  Trade Boards Acts andthe inspectors appointed under the  Unemployment Insurance Act. This process is not complete, but a  number of inspectors of the latter class are already engaged in trade board inspection.  Trade Board inspectors have,  since the passing of the original act of 1909, been appointed by selection, on the basis of general educational qualifications.The Unemployment Insurance Inspectors are recruited by promotion from the  generalEmployment Exchange  service.  The  future method of recruitment  of both classes isunder consideration. (17^ November.)Unemployment Insurance Act.    Captain Terrell  asked the Minister of  Labour whether the Association of approved societies  has not agreed to work the Unemployment  Insurance Act;  and what, in that case, is the number of societies which are represented in that organisation.    Dr. Macnamara: Provisional approval has been given, subject  to the prescribedconditions,  to an arrangement under Section  17  of the Unemployment Insurance Act,1920, with the National Association for Unemployment Insurance, which has been consti-tuted by  a  combination of the National Conference of Friendly Societies, the Associationof Approved Societies, and the Joint  Committee of Approved Societies.  information in regard to the constituent societies which have decided to undertake the administrationof the Act through  the  National Association for Unemployment Insurance has not yetbeen received.  (18th November.)
