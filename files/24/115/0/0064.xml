    4 --^^J34TS.   In view  of  delay in ratification of Turkish Peace  Treaty, we venture,;^J^..;:0ven at eleventh hour,  to represent changes, both in external and internal situation of       India,  since announcement of treaty, which make it desirable (?, in  omitted)  our       opinion to consider whether it would not be in our interest to modify terms with view       to conciliation  of Moslem opinion.   We understand  that  one  of  the  main pre-       occupations of His Majesty&apos;s  Government has been, and is, to obtain through those       terms greater security than before for British position in Asia.   We feel that develop-       ment and progressive  embitterment of Moslem opinion regarding terms as they now     ,  stand has  rendered  that  position much less secure than before war.  Outstanding       feature of situation seems .to  us to be that, before war,  British were, in spite of their       acquiescence in  result of Italian  and  Balkan victories over Turkey,  regarded by bulk       of Moslem opinion as  friends of Islam, while Russians were considered its enemies;       but since announcement of terms Britain has,  in eyes of  Asia, become arch (? enemy) of       Islam, and future of  Islam is in danger through British action.  This impression  has       been  deepened  by attitude, if not  of French Government, of French Press, and of       Italians, which has been exploited in  India by Khilafat agitators, who represent that       Britain alone has insisted, against wishes  of her allies,  on dismemberment.of Turkey.       In Syria, Emir Faisal has been suspected of intriguing  with Turks;  In  Mesopotamia,       even  Shiah  centres of  Kerbala  and Najaf have been  antagonised by Turkish       Nationalist  agitators.  In Arabia proper,  King Hussein has  drifted  into  more&apos;  and       more anti-British  attitude, while his Government has been  further discredited by       reports  of   maladministration  brought  by returning  pilgrims.  In Afghanistan,       Turkish peace  terms  and question of Khilafat have been openly announced as chief       obstacle in the way of friendly relations between Afghans and British.  Simultaneously       proposals have  been mooted for election of  new Khalifa, who will be less subject to       European pressure,  and  there has  been definite  suggestion that Amir  should be     - invited to become Khalifa, which would have an  obviously revolutionary effect upon       whole frontier position.            In India itself, feeling against Turkish peace terms has steadily intensified  under       pressure of  religious  leaders and  great personal influence of  Gandhi,  and  has       penetrated to lower strata of Moslem population, which were, before announcement of       terms, apparently insensitive.  Party of non-coroperation have  found in it one of their       most dangerous and effective weapons, using  it as a religious  grievance to  foster       political excitement.   There  is obviously danger  that sepoys and their recruit(ing)       (? corrupt  group), and  environment are being  inoculated.  &quot;Loyal  and  moderate       Moslem(? s in some)  parts of country are boycotted and rendered impotent  to help us       by accusations  of being  Kaffij.   All these  circumstances  constitute a real  and       growing danger to  administration.   We  had hoped lapse of time would gradually4       reduce (? this) feeling, but we regret&apos;we see no sign of  this, rather the contrary.. - We       think, however, it  may  yet he possible to  retrieve the  situation.  Loyal  Indian       Moslems are groping for solution which will enable them to reconcile loyalty with       religion.  Thus a  deputation of Moslems of unquestioned loyalty, headed by President       of Bahawalpur  State Council and  (? Pali tana) Chief, have been  to see Maclagan to       press  for (? alteration of)  peace terms,  (?-  especially  by)  recognition  of  nominal       suzerainty of Turkey in countries previously under her rule.   Similar suggestion for       nominal suzerainty,  but  more restricted in area,  has been  secretly made  to local       authorities  by Maulana Mahmud Hassan, the  very influential Maulvi of Deoband,       whom  we  interned at  Malta,   He  stated that  essential grievance centred  round     - Hedjaz, where Moslems believed Sharif to be puppet in the hands of English, and       holy  places  to  he therefore under English control, and  that, if  this obstacle were       removed, all life would be taken out of agitation.  As (? solution)  he advocated  that       Sharif should be induced by some means pecuniary or otherwise, preferably through       ex Sheikh-Ul-Islam,  interned at Malta, to  accept Turkish suzerainty.  If this could be       arranged, his own influence, both in India and across the Frontier, would be on the       side of Government.   It is significant that restitution  of Turkish suzerainty, however       nominal, over former  Turkish  dominions,  was  solution put forward by-Afghan       delegates at (? Mussoorie). &quot;.            This (? repromulgation of) Moslem opinion, together with steady deterioration in       political situation so far as Moslems  are concerned, impels us to repeat suggestion,       which we have  urged  since beginning of discussion  of Turkish terms, namely, that       Turkish suzerainty in  some form be recognised  at least over Hedjaz, and if possible,       over  other  sacred places.  We  do  not  think  this proposal in any way infringes       principle that the  question of Khalifat is one for Moslems- alone.  We are conscious       that you have throughout shared our  forebodings  and misgivings  regarding Turkish       peace terms, and it  is the generous support you have given  to  India in matter that.       encourages us to press oil His Majesty&apos;s Government again &quot;our views oi^ a  question of       gravest moment to India and the East generally.(P 8413)         From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,            6096  \ * \\                        23rcZ November 1920.
