4hThis  document is the property of His Britannic Majestys  Government.   270SECRET.THE CABINET.CONDITIONS  IN THRACE.     MEMORANDUM&apos; BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR WAR.    1 circulate to my colleagues a report  by one of our  intelligence officers on theconditions in Thrace.   The interest of this report lies in the  fact that it was written on10th November, four days before the elections in Greece took place.                                                                     W. S. C.01451087THE WAR OFFICE,  25th November, 1920.    The following  information has  been supplied by a former Intelligence Officer whohas recently been travelling through this district.  His report is dated 10th November,i.e., before the elections in Greece which took place on  14th November.    Military. The number of Greek troops in the  Adrianople district is now verysmall,   There has been no disorder and at present none appears likely.    The sympathies of the troops, officers and men, are by no means  enthusiasticallypro-Entente.    Political. For some weeks the political situation has not been good, and on the death of King Alexander matters became worse.    No section  of the population is  in favour of Greek rule; all  are  antagonistic to compulsory military service.    Thousands of inhabitants, mainly Armenians, adopted Greek nationality, but havenow found that no Greek subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 are allowed to leavethe country.    The Bulgars of the Kirk Kilisse district have either become naturalized Greeks or have  left for Bulgaria.  The  Bulgar  community of Adrianople is not recognized  andtheir churches and schools have been banded over to the Greeks.    There is considerable royalist feeling and propaganda; the majority of the army officers are royalist and say so  openly.  The royalist sympathisers in the ranks probablynumber about  30 per cent.   The whole of the army is opposed  to military service,  andwould vote for any Government which would abolish conscription.    A large number of officers and non-commissioned officers are taking lessons inGerman.  This is the only foreign language in which instruction is being sought.    Administration. The Greek fee for a transit visa from Bulgaria to Constantinopleis 18 drachmae, which is an exorbitant charge.  Most travellers now go by sea.    By order  of the Supreme Council the Turkish and Bulgar customs duties are  stillin force.  The Greeks have  asked for permission to substitute Greek duties.    Economic. The cost  of  living is incredibly high.  The  spending power of thedrachma in Thrace is  equal to a fraction more than 2 levas in Bulgaria, while  theexchange rate is 8 levas to one drachma.    The future. All sections of the population  and the army express the opinion thatGreece  cannot hold  Thrace;  firstly,  because  they  cannot afford to administer it;secondly, because they do not  know how to; thirdly, because they cannot afford a bigenough army to garrison it.  The  opinions as  to the  length of the Greek  occupationvary between 6 months and 3  years.    The report states that there were  indications  that the population  of  Thraceexpected a re-actionary movement in Greece which would re-establish Constantine, andthat this would be quickly followed by a renunciation of Greek claims to  Thrace, the fate of which might then be settled by a plebiscite.(B20/471)  100 11/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8726wo
