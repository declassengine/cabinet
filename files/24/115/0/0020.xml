This Document is the Property of34His Britannic  Majesty&apos;3 Government...SECRET.G,g.-aiE0.               0 A h X IT 3 T.                   .   .(Revised)            THB  CASE  OP  EGYPT, &apos;         Memorandum by the President, Board  of Education.       &amp;s my duties at Geneva will prevent me from participating  in tho concluding deliberations of the Cabinet upon the  Egyptian question, I ta^e this opportunity of expressing such  views as I have been able to form on the basis of the two  Conferences whioh I have attended.    (1)  Although it has been explained to us that the  Cabinet  is In no wise committed to the recommendations of the Milner  Mission we should, I thinx,  encounter serious ris^s if we  were altogether to reject the conclusions  of a body se  influential in composition and presided over by a Minister  of the Crown who,  of all living Englishmen, is best quall-  fied by reason of his experience to speai  with authority  upon Egyptian questions*   Technically, we are well within  our rights in discarding the miner Report,  practically,  we should be confronted with great difficulties if we were  to adopt such a course and upon this Lord  Allenby, who does  not li:-:e every feature in the Report, spo.ce with no uncertain  voice.  Egyptian opinion would be inflamed;  the Arab-speaking  world would accuse us of yot another broken pledge.  Jfor  could the case for a refusal of the policy be stated to the  British public without affronting a 6r^et  body of opinion  upon which the Government relies for its support.    (2)  Quito apart from this and jud^inb the case, purely on  merits I should li/ie the Cabinet to accept the governing  principle of the Report.   Wist is that governing principle?  It is tint our position in Egypt should be regularised by a &quot;bi-laterca agreement between the British government on the,  one hand and by those who are qualified to speai: for  the  Egyptian nation on the other, and that It  should be thus  founded upon the expressed and fonn/il consent of the                             -1-              Egyptian
Egyptian people.  I will not elaborate the arguments which&quot;Lord Milner has adduced in support of tho conclusion that weshould endeavour to secure a willing acceptance by theEgyptian nationalists of our privileged position in Egypt.Those arguments are, in my ^:low, very strong.  Palling suchacceptance our predominance in Egypt will always be contestedfrom within and challenged from without.  If, on the otherhand, wo can arrive at an agreement which satisfies Egyptiannational pride - and political self-respect is after all, a good and not a bad element in human nature and one for the develop-ment of which among the Egyptians wo ourselves ar* mainly res-ponsible,- without sacrificing conditions essential to themilitary security of the Empire, our position in the world willbe greatly improved0       (3)   It is true that the agreement Involves the abandon^ment of the Protectorate which was assumed during the War.We shall be asked to haul down the British flag and I appreciateand to some extent share, the repugnance which most Englishmenfeel when they are asked to retreat from a forward position.which they have once taken up.  I think, however, that in thecircumstances of this case that repugnance Is reduced to aminimum.  -;&apos;e assumed the Protectorate of Egypt as a Warmeasure.  It was just as much a war measure as the establishmentof the Central Control Board.  It was useful to us In anemergency but now that the emergency is passed we can review the situation without prejudice and reverse our decision if wethink it politic to do so, without any damage to nationalprestige.  The Milner Report offers us all the essentialsof a Protectorate without the name.  T/e are in fact to bethe sole protectors of Egypt.  We  are to ratify all her foreigntreaties.  Though our Army of Occupation is to be withdrawnthe overwhelming pressure of the British Empire will bethe predominant fact which will colour and shape all
tho relations of Egypt with the outside world,       (4)   The two principal points of difficulty are thoconcession of foreign relations and the military controlsUnder the scheme of the Milner HissIon* Egypt will be repro-sentod by accredited envoys in foreign countries and theforeign countries will have their accredited envoys in Cairo *Tho Egyptian Ministers abroad will be charged with the dutyof looking after the interests of Egyptian traders andtravellers and of negotiating arrangements which will haveto be submitted to us fb-&apos;  spproval and then presumablyregistered by the League of Nations.  So long as Great .Britain has the right of controlling the treaty-makingpower I can see only good In this proposal.  Let us assume that we refuse such a concession to the Egyptians, do wein any way diminish the opportunities for intrigue opento Egypt in foreign capitals, or the opportunities forintrigue open to foreign Powers in Cairo?  I do not thinkso*  Intrigues will go on whether or not the intriguersare duly accredited, but it is reasonable to suppose that ifthe spirit of Egyptian nationalism can be enlisted on behalfof the British Empire instead of against it, our diplomaticposition in foreign capitals will be so much the easier9      (5)   It is admitted that Egypt is vital to the securityof our military communications with the East.  It is athousand times more valuable to us than Mesopotamia orPersia.  Lord Milner seems to have been successful in securing the assent of Egyptian nationalism to the proposi-tion that we must take precautions for socuring our military position in Egypt.  On the other hand, it is part of the agreement thftt there is to be no Army ofOccupation   This raises a difficulty, for Lord Allenbygave, it as his opinion that if there were to be troopsanywhere in Egypt, that they should be placed in Cairo,
 the  centre of  all vital ncmmunieetions.    I  do  net  kn*w  i how  far the Egyptians  would accept  as  an integral part of the   proposal,  an arrangement under whioh a  small body of troops  should  he  retained in Cairo, mainly for  the  police purpose of securing the personal safety  of the  High Commissioner and  of the Foreign Legations.    This seems to me  to he a  proposal which might  bo  worth  rnaicing, especially in  view of  the faot that it is desirable that foreign Powers  should  make their representations  to us and  not directly  to the Egyptian Government  in  tho  event of a disturbance  in  Cairo  affecting the safety  of  their own nationals.   I  would not,  however,  insist on this condition if it were  liicely to prove fatal to en agreement.   After all  Lord Cromer got cn well enough  without troops.   So does our  Political  Officer  at Hyderabad.  I should have  thought also  that it wae  quite  possible  to  give  to the  Suez  Canal zone an Interpretation sufficiently liberal  to  enable British troops, and more particularly  British aerodromes, to be stationed in no  immediate  proximity to the Canal. With oomplete naval control,  with an established system cf aerial  communications,  with our  military grip on the Sudan, and  on  the  Canal  zone  in peace  time, and  with the right to complete an effective  use of the whole country  for military purposes in time of war, with Palestine under British influence,  and  with the  German Navy  at  the  bottom of the  seas,  with  Malta and Cyprus  at  no  great  distance, I should  imagine  that wo  might snap our  fingers at any military risks  to our  position in Egypt  for  the next generation. &apos; (6)   Meanwhile  Egyptian nationalism  is  a fcrce which we cannot permanently  affront without  increasing our diffi- culties  all through the  East as  well as  in Europe.   I do not know Egypt, but I  have met a considerable number of young Egyptian  nationalists during  the last  fifteen  years. They are capable  of,stirring up  a good deal  of  trouble.  I^now of  an epic in  Arabic  on the rise  of  Japan  written a few
                                                              tr% *t **-^before the War by an Egyptian Copt which had a aonsidorablc circulation all over Arabia.   The Arab speaking world does net look with indifference on the rise and progress of this Egyptian movement and as wo are not likely to have friendship with the Russian for some time to come,  and have encountered the deep enmity of the Turk,  it appears  to be a plain counsel of common sense to stretch a point if tho acceptance of this Report can be so  described,  with a view to showing the Arab-speaking world that we  are honestly studious of their interests and  susceptibilities. 7.    It is suggested that we should hold out to  Egypt the prospect - and  if we were to  speak our true mind it would be a very distant prospect - of  becoming a Dominion of the British Empire,    To this I am opposed,    Egypt has  never,  save during the wholly exceptional period  of the war,  been part of the  British Empire,  nor does she- desire to be part of the British Empire,    There are few  regions of the world more alien to  us in history,  national temperament or institutions.    Egypt  is  a thoroughly  foreign country.    If  she  is    allowed  the  symbols  of Nationality,  she will acquiesce  in the  substance of  a  Protectorate.
