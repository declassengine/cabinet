Telegram from Viceroy, Finance Department, dated 18th November 1920.             Priority A.             Secret.  An examination made a month ago of our probable revenue  position        during current year and  next year pointed to necessity for  increasing our revenue        resources  in  coming  budget, not  only in order to  meet  existing commitments,        particularly with regard to gradual reduction of provincial contributions, but also to        provide  from revenue an  annual (? sum) for  rehabilitation of our general financial        position in respect  more especially of floating debt and of  loss on exchange.   Exact        amount  of additional  resources necessary can only  be determined  after  further        examination of our position based on six months&apos; estimates, and after your approval        has been taken to amount which should be set aside from revenue towards general        purposes of rehabilitation.  In any case there can be no doubt  that some  additional        taxation will be necessary.             2. We have  therefore already started a  preliminary examination of  possible        sources of increased revenue.  Our attention has naturally been first directed towards        import duties both because these seem susceptible of further increases without injury        to  trade and also because additional taxation of  this nature  is  likely to  provoke        minimum  of  opposition.   To increase  our customs  revenue  first  natural step is to        make some all-round enhancement  of present act valorem duty of 1\ per cent., accom-        panied by a corresponding enhancement  of  the  existing special rates  on certain        articles, thus preserving the present essentially revenue character of our tariff.   Any        such general enhancement of present ad valorem duties involves, however, enhance-        ment of duty on cotton manufactures, and it would  be useless for us to proceed  with        formulation of our  proposals in this matter if  enhancement of duty on cotton manu-         factures is likely to  be  (? rule)ed out in limine  for political  reasons.   It  would        obviously  be  impossible  to  obtain consent of Legislative  Assembly  either (a) to         enhancement of general ad valorem duty in respect of  all remaining articles, leaving        that on cotton manufactures unchanged, or (b) to enhancement of general ad valorem         duty, including that on cotton manufactures, accompanied by  countervailing enhance-         ment in cotton excise duty.              3. If, therefore, you find it impossible to agree to enhancement of duty on cotton         manufactures, it will then be necessary for us to  confine  our  increases of  Customs         revenue to taxes on certain articles such as liquor, tobacco, and possibly petroleum,         though so far as we can see at  present,  any practicable additional  taxation on  such         articles will not  yield  us anything approaching  amount  necessary to provide the         additional revenue required, which, on the assumption that military  expenditure will         in future not exceed the  60 crores entered in this year&apos;s Budget, is likely to amount         to at least five crores.  In the event of enhancement of general ad valorem duty being         impossible,  we shall, therefore,  be very reluctantly obliged  to consider substantial         increases in direct taxation.              4. We shall  be grateful, therefore, for indication from you of line which you are         prepared to  adopt in matter of  enhancement of import duty on cotton manufactures.         Our general taxation  proposals will require very careful consideration by us before         submission to you, and you will, no  doubt, agree that it is undesirable that time should         be wasted in preparing a scheme of new taxation, an important portion of which  must         fall to the ground  on  a preliminary question of principle.  We have  considered  it         proper to make  this  reference to you, though we  assume that  in view  of the recoin-         mendation of  the Joint Select Committee on  clause  33 of  Government of India Bill,         you would not desire to oppose a formal recommendation for tariff changes in question         should  it represent the  combined view of  Government  of India and  Legislative         Assembly.              2. I  do not propose to trouble my colleagues  with any  justification  for the         imposition of additional taxation.  I am satisfied that this is necessary.               280S    100  11.20                    A
    3. The Indian cotton dlilies were last, altered in .1917,  To provide  a portion ofthe  additional taxation  required in  connection, with India&apos;s  war contribution  of100,000,000/., the import duty on cotton manufactures was raised from 3i- to 1\ percent,  ad valorem, the cotton excise (3k per cent.) remaining unchanged.     This  was fiercely resented by Lancashire, as  a violation of the political truce, anddeputations to the Secretary, of State for India and the Prime Minister were followedby a  debate  in  the  Mouse of Commons in  March 1017 on the Motion relating to thecontributions.  An  amendment expressing regret that &quot; the provision for meeting the&quot;  charges of the contribution should.include an alteration in the established system of&quot;  duties on cotton goods, thereby throwing an unnecessary  burden upon the  people&quot;  of  India, and inevitably  causing a  controversy between  different  parts  of  the&quot;  Empire, which it  was most inexpedient to  raise during the war&quot; was rejected by265 votes to .125, but  on -the suggestion  of Mr. Asquith the following  addition wasmade to the Motion :      &quot;This House  at  the same time declares its opinion  that such changes  as are       proposed in the Indian Budget in the system of Indian cotton duties should he       considered  afresh when the  fiscal  relationship of  the  various  parts of the       Empire to one another, and to the rest of  the world, come  to be reviewed at       the close of the war.&quot;     The  Resolution as agreed  to  by  the  House of  Commons  is reproduced  inAppendix II.    4. Since that date the question of India&apos;s responsibility for the determination ofher fiscal policy has received consideration in connection with  constitutional reforms,and   I  include  in  Appendix  I. to  this note  certain recent  statements made  inParliament  and Parliamentary papers on the subject, which recognise the importanceof avoiding, so far as may be, any interference from this side with the  shaping ofIndian fiscal policy.    Having regard  to the views expressed in  these authoritative pronouncements,I propose  (unless any of my colleagues  represent to me  that they would  wish, todiscuss the matter),  to  inform the Government of India that  I  do not intend to  rule out on the point of  principle any recommendations that they  may think fit  to  putforward, for raising the general rate of  import duties in  India,  including that on cotton manufactures without imposing any  corresponding increase in the  cottonexcise.                                                                      E. S. M.   . 25th November 1920.APPENDIX I.       (A) EXTRACT FROM  REPORT ON  INDIAN  CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS,  1918.                                 Fiscal Policy.    341. Connected ultimately with the matter of industries is  the question of theIndian tariff.   This subject  was excluded from the deliberations  of the  IndustrialCommission now sitting, because it  was not desirable  at  that juncture to raise  anyquestion of the modification of India&apos;s fiscal policy; but its  exclusion was none theless the object of some legitimate criticism in India.  The  changes which we proposein&apos;the-Government of India will still leave the settlement of lnd;a&apos;s tariff in  the handsof a Government amenable to  Parliament  and the Secretary  of State; but inasmuch as the tariff reacts on many matters which will henceforth come more and more underIndian control, we think it well that we  should put forward for the information of HisMajesty&apos;s Government the views of educated Indians upon  this subject.   We have no immediate proposals to make ; we are anxious merely that any decisions which mayhereafter be taken,  should  be taken  with  full appreciation of  educated Indian.opinion.                          Desire for a Protective Tariff.    342. The theoretical free trader,  we believe, hardly exists in India at present.As was shown  by the  debates in the Indian  Legislative Council in  March  1913,
educated Indian opinion  ardently desires a tariff.  It rightly  wishes to find anothersubstantial base than that of the land for Indian revenues, and  it turns to a tariff toprovide one.   Desiring industries which will give him Indian-made clothes to wear and indian-made articles to use, the educated Indian looks to the example of other countrieswhich have relied on tariffs, and seizes on the admission of even free traders that forthe nourishment of  nascent  industries a  tariff  is permissible.   We do not knowwhether he pauses to reflect that these industries  will be largely financed by foreign capital attracted by the tariff, although  we have evidence that he  has not learned to appreciate the advantages of foreign capital.  But whatever economic fallacy underlieshis reasoning, these are  his firm beliefs; and though he may be willing to concede the possibility that he is  wrong, he will  not  readily concede that it is our business todecide the matter for him. He believes that as long as we continue  to decide for him.we shall decide in the interests of England  and not according to his wishes ; and hepoints to the debate in the House of Commons on the differentiation of the cottonexcise in support of his contention.   So long as the people who refuse India protectionare interested in manufactures with which India might compete, Indian opinion cannotbring itself to believe that the refusal is  disinterested or dictated by care for the best interests of India.   This  real and keen desire for fiscal autonomy does not mean thateducated opinion in India is unmindful of Imperial obligations.   On the contrary,  itfeels  proud of,  and  assured by, India&apos;s connection with the Empire, and does not desire a severance that  would mean cutting  the ties of loyalty to the Crown, theassumption of new  and very heavy responsibilities, and a  loss  of  standing  in theworld&apos;s affairs.   Educated Indians  recognise  that  they are great gainers by theImperial connection, and they are willing to accept its drawbacks.  They recognisethat the  question of a  tariff may be mainly, but  is not wholly, a matter of domesticpolitics.                         Method of deciding the Question.     343.  We could not  conclude  our  discussion  of India&apos;s industrial developmentwithout some statement of what we believe to be the opinion of educated Indians upon this subject.   But our enquiry has not  been concerned  with fiscal questions ;  and theviews expressed upon them have come before us  only as the main reason which thosewho asked for popular control over India&apos;s  finances gave in  support of their request.It is obvious that any tariff that might be framed for India must take account not only of the  views  of educated Indians but  of the probable  incidence  of  the  burden oftaxation upon the masses of the population.  It has been decided by Parliament thatthe fiscal relations of all parts of the Empire and the  rest  of the world  should  beconsidered after the war, and we assume that this consideration will be by an ImperialConference on which India will be adequately represented.   (B) EXTRACT FROM REPORT OF JOINT SELECT  COMMITTEE ON THE  GOVERNMENT                              OF INDIA BILL (1919).     Clause 33. The Committee have given most careful consideration to the relations of the Secretary  of State with  the  Government of India,  and through it with theprovincial Governments.   In the relations of the Secretary of State with the Governor-General in Council the Committee are not of opinion that any statutory change can bemade,  so long as the Governor-General remains responsible  to Parliament, but inpractice the conventions which now govern these relations may wisely be modified tomeet fresh circumstances caused by the creation  of  a Legislative  Assembly with alarge elected  majority.  In the exercise of his responsibility to Parliament, which he cannot delegate to anyone else,  the Secretary of State may reasonably consider that only in exceptional circumstances should he be called  upon to intervene in matters of purely Indian interest where the Government  and the Legislature of  India are inagreement.     This examination of the  general proposition leads  inevitably to  the considerationof one special case of non-intervention.  Nothing is more likely to endanger the good relations between India  and Great Britain than a  belief  that  India&apos;s fiscal policy isdictated from Whitehall in the interests of the  trade  of Great Britain.  That such abelief exists at the moment there can be no doubt.   That there ought to be no  room for it  in the  future  is  equally clear.   India&apos;s  position in the Imperial, Conferenceopened the door to  negotiation between  India and  the  rest of the Empire, but      2808                             A 2
negotiation without power to legislate is likely to remain ineffective.   A satisfactory solution  of  the  question  can only  be  guaranteed by  the  grant of liberty  to  theGovernment  of India to devise those tariff arrangements which  seem best fitted toIndia&apos;s needs as  an integral portion of the British Empire.  It cannot be guaranteed by Statute without limiting the ultimate power of Parliament to control the adminis-tration of India,  and without limiting the  power of veto which rests in the Crown;;and neither of these limitations  finds a  place in any of the Statutes in  the BritishEmpire.   It can only therefore be  assured by an acknowledgment of a convention.Whatever be the right fiscal policy for India,  for the needs of  her consumers as wellas for her manufacturers, it is quite clear that she should  have the same liberty to-consider her interests as  Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and SouthAfrica.   In the opinion of the Committee, therefore, the Secretary of  otate should, asfar as possible, avoid interference on this subject when the Government of  India andits Legislature are  in agreement, and they think that  his intervention, when it  doestake place, should  be limited to  safeguarding the international obligations  of theEmpire  or any  fiscal  arrangements within  the Empire to  which  His  Majesty&apos;s.Government is a party.  (o) EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES BY MR.  MONTAGU ON GOVERNMENT  OF INDIA BILL IN                 HOUSE OF  COMMONS,  DATED  4TH DECEMBER 1919.     MR. MONTA-GU :  I hope I shall be able to convince the hon. and gallant Member (Colonel Wedgwood) that what, he seeks to do is quite unnecessary.   The proper plan of  Parliamentary  procedure is that fiscal proposals should  be proposed by  the Government.  I am quite in agreement with  the hon. Member with regard to fiscal autonomy for India, and I would point out that it is not  the Government of India which has been in disagreement  on  this point.  It has  been the Secretary of  State. There has been no controversy between the officials and the non-officials.  Most of the officials have been Protectionists.   I myself, as  the hon. and gallant Member knows,, am a convinced Free Trader, but I hope the example  afforded by Protection in India will make more Free Traders.     MR.  MONTAGU : I clo not  think fiscal autonomy comes into this clause at all; it is. merely concerned with such matters as  allowing  the Government of India to  act in administrative matters  when it is in agreement with the Legislative Councils.   All measures  connected with fiscal questions  will  be Bills,  and all Bills will have to receive  the  sanction of  the  Crown.  The  King has  a veto over all legislation, and thereforefnothing that can be done under section 33 will, I think, be likely to  affect that matter.   I  wish, it  were otherwise,  because if there  is  anybody in this Plouse who thinks we ought still to manipulate the tariffs of India in the interests  of any part of Great Britain I should like to test that by a division.   My hon. friend says,  &quot; How are &quot; we to guarantee  that India will not manipulate her  affairs to the advantage of &quot; somebody  else &quot; ?  What guarantee  have we  that Australia will not  do the same ?There is nothing which would do us so much harm as the  slightest suspicion that we want to  alter  the  tariffs of  India in the interests of British  trade.  We have the solidarity of the Empire to depend upon, and the  Imperial  goodwill, which has always been developed by mutual  trust, and I think my hon. friend (Mr. Stewart) isperfectly right to have raised this question,  which ought  to  be  decided, but I do  not.think it can  be decided under this Bill.  (D) EXTRACT  FROM SPEECH OF EARL  CURZON OF  KEDLESTON  IN HOUSE OF LORDS ON             GOVERNMENT OF INDIA BILL, DATED  12TH DECEMBER 1919.     And  I  must allude to one more of the Committee&apos;s findings, to which I amastonished that no reference has  been made in this House that is, the question ofthe fiscal policy.  For  the  first  time  a responsible and representative British Com-mittee, charged with shaping a Government for India, have conceded  to India almostabsolute freedom of fiscal policy.  They have laid down the proposition and theprinciple that she ought to be free  to exercise, in  respect of her tariffs and so  on, thesame degree of liberty  as is enjoyed by the great Dominions  of the Crown.  That isa change so fundamental and fraught  with  such stupendous  consequences that I amamazed at the little attention which it has attracted  in this country.  It will be, I do-mot say one of  the  main sources  of  possible difference in the future between  certain.
sections of the community here and in India, but it  is a  starting point to a futurecareer in the growth of self-governing institutions in India, the importance of whichcannot be exaggerated.  I am the last  to complain of  it, because  in all  the  con-troversies about cotton duties and so on I have always fought the battles of India.Some of your Lordships may have heard  me more  than once  do so  in this House;therefore I am delighted to see my views and my theories prevail.  But  do not letyour Lordships lose sight of the fact  that among the changes that have  been created in this Bill, and among the powers that you are handing to India, this  particular one is in many respects the most important of all.                                APPENDIX II.       RESOLUTION AGREED TO  IN HOUSE OF COMMONS ON  14TH MARCH 1917.Resolved-    &quot;That, whereas the Government  of  India, deeming the well-being and  interestsof the Indian Empire to be vitally concerned in the successful prosecution of thewar, have recommended that a  contribution charged on the revenues  of India shouldbe made towards the expenses of the  same, such  contribution  to  consist  of  the sumof 100,000,OOOZ. to be  provided  in part from the proceeds of a loan to be raised inIndia  and the  remainder by assuming liability for interest on British War Loan ofthe required amount, and whereas this contribution has been offered to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and gratefully accepted by them, and the Government of India have now made  provision by legislation  and in their Revenue and Expenditure Estimates  for meeting, by  means of increased taxation and otherwise, the annual charge for interestand sinking  fund in respect of the contribution as aforesaid, this House consents that a contribution of  100,000,000L charged on the revenues of India shall be made towardsthe cost of  the war.   This House at the same time  declares its  opinion that such changes as  are proposed in the Indian Budget in the system of Indian Cotton duties should be considered afresh when the fiscal relationships of the various parts of  theEmpire to one another and to the rest of the world come to be  reviewed at the close of the War.&quot;
