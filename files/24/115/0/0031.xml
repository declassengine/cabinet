The exceptional unemployment caused by the coal strike is again reduced, butthe general position remains worse than before the strike.  The trade depression of textile,  clothing, boot and shoe and leather trades remains practically unchanged,and there are no signs of  any improvement  at present, although in one or twoLancashire towns some of the cotton mills previously  closed have been re-started.In certain places some improvement is noticeable in regard  to ship repairing, and increased orders are  reported in  one area in  connection with  the motor industry,but, generally speaking, considerable slackness still exists in the engineering and ship-building trades.   The general falling off of trade is also  causing unemployment among transport workers.                         II. EMERGENCY WORK.
