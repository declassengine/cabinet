 THIS gOCUMgjg IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC           MA JESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. .      CABINET MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOIJR.             INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION,                part XITI.  Treaty of Versailles.  1.   Ariiole 405 of the Treaty of Versailles  ( abour clauseprovides that when a draft convention is adopted by  the requisite majority at a General conference  ofrepresentatives of  Members of the international LabourOrganisation (i.e. Members of the League of Nations  andcertain other States)(  each member,  irrespective of whether its delegates1 Voted against the  draft convention or whether it was represented at  the conference^ must,normally within a period of one year from the closing ofthe session,  &quot;bring the...draft oonvention before  theauthority or authorities within whose competence thematter lies,  for the enactment of legislation of otheraotion&quot;.2.  In the case of the yjashington International LabourConference (the first held by the Organisation) the  periodof IE months within which each State must take  the actionabove specified,  expires on the 27th January next.   It istherefore necessary to establish a procedure for ratifying(or declining to ratify) the several draft conventions adopted at&apos;Washington,  particularly the  MaternityConvention.  This latter, which secured  the necessary two-thirds majority, was opposed by the  British government delegates, and on the 26th October last, the Home  AffairsCommittee, at the suggestion of Dr, Addison, decided thatit should not be ratified,  questions are being asked                                                /in
in the House by Mr. G.N.Barnes and Major  Hills,as to the intentions of the Government, vis-a-vis theInternational Labour organisation and  parliament withregard to this draft convention.   So far,  temporisinganswers haVe been given.     The question for urgent decision  is,  what, in thecase of Great Britain,  is the competent Authority; isit Parliament, or is it the exeoiitive; or is it sometimesone ana sometimes the other?  The words &quot;or ether action&quot;suggest that the competent authority may  vary according as legislation is or is not required.3.  There are three main  cases; -     (a) 7here the British Government  decides to ratify       a donvention and lepislation is necessary to carry       it Out - here no substantial difficulty arises.       Technically the  Crown as ihe1 Treaty making       Authority till j  on the advide of Ministers, decide       to ratify, and will put the neoessary legislative       measures through parliament at  the  same time.     (b) vhere the British Government  decides to ratify a       Draft convention,  and there is  already legislation       sufficient to enable the Government to oarry out       its obligation under the Draft  convention by       departmental action without further reference to       parliament - here  a^ain no difficulty is likely to       arise.  It is reasonable to regard the British       Government in such a case  as the competent author-       ity,     (o) The really difficult alternative arises when, as       in the case of the jfciternity Draft  convention,       the British Government is  opposed  to a Draft        Convention and  decide net to ratify it.  Do the       words of the Treaty entitle the Government to       refn.se to ratify,  (  as in  the oase of an ordinary       Treaty); or do they require the Government to       bring the Draft  convention before  parliament for       disoussion, leaving it to  parliament to deoide the       question of ratification or non-ratification ?       The former appears to accord r ith  the ordinary       British practice and the constitutional law as       to the prerogative of the  Crown.   The latter in-       terpretation id  adopted by the  International       Labour Office - an interpretation  to vhioh colour       is perhaps given by the report  of  the Commission on       International Labour Legislation which drafted       the Labour Clauses of the  Treaty.  (Appended hereto       is an extract from a letter recently addressed to       the Swiss Press  by m. Thomas, the  Director of the       International Labour Office.)     It must be borne in  mind that the International Labour                                               /Offices
Office&apos;s view is probably supported by working class organi-sations throughout Europe.  The intention of the  Treatyprobably vas, in the case of retrograde or laggardGovernments who raic:ht be disposed to reject Conventions,to supply machinery ^hereby in the national parliamentsthose interested in labour could bring pressure to  bearon their Governments and stimulate public opinion in caseof non-ratification.  On the other hand it is a somewhatserious matter if, in all cases ^here the Government decidesnot to ratify a Draft convention, the decision must beleft to Parliament who might come to a contrary decision.There is the further point that parliament must includethe Lords as well as tne Commons  and the two Housesmight come to different decisions.4,  The Cabinet is accordingly ^sked to decide:-     1. TThether, as a matter of policy,  the interpretation        of the International Labour office shall  be        accepted, and conventions rhich the Government        decides not to uatify must be brought before        parliament by Resolution or otherwise even if it        involves a limitation of the treaty-making        prerogative - such limitation being held  to have        been sanctioned by the Treaty of peace let,  1919.     S* Aether the  above intornrrtati )n  shall  DO resisted,        at  any rato  until tho  law Officers have given        their opinion on the  truo interpretation  of        Artiole 405*(Signed)        T, J.  MACEA.MARA.Minister of Labour.17th November 192t.
