i&quot;            This Dooi:n ;r:: !o Mid Property of             ,, . .  .9 j -I            His -Or:: Maj33 y&apos;s Government.IIQPPR OOTOROt (MgQRAHY PROVISIONS) Bill.   9347a/202154&quot; ^eJfort of a Special Committee of the Central Control                   Boarfl (Liquor Traffic)..    Tho Committee appointed by the Board to consider the liquor control (Temporary Provisions) Bill,  introduced by theGovernment and read a first time on the 11th of November, begto report to the Board that they have held two meetings, and now submit to tho Board the rosult of their deliberations.    The Committee assume that the intention of theGovernment in introducing this Bill is to set up some formof temporary administration, which, with the freshParliamentary authority thus givon to it, and with propersecurities for Parliamentary control over its actions,will bridge over the interval which must still elapse before permanent legislation can be passed, and will maintain that system of regulation which under the Boardhas been of such great national benefit.    The Committee are in complete agreement with this intention, and so far as the Bill expresses that intentionthey would strongly support it.  They wish however to record their disagreement with the particular form ofadministration which the Bill proposes to set up as themeans of attaining the object whioh is understood to be                                                  in/
                                                1.242in view,     Ihilo under permanent legislation the Committeereoognise that a separate Bill will he necessary forScotland, they are of opinion that until such enactment,practical difficulties and no good results will accrue from setting up distinct authorities for the different parts of Great Britain.     Reviewing the history of the Control Board&apos;activities, the Committee are convinced that the large measure of public support which was accorded during thewar to the Board1s administration of the very wide powerscommitted to them by Parliament, has been largely dueto the representation on the Board of so many varietiesof experience and shades of public opinion,   Theyventure to doubt whether the same public support willbo forthcoming for the exercise of similarly wide powers by a Government Department as sot out in the Bill.     The Committee respectfully suggest that the situation would be met by the appointment of an authority as widely representative as is the present 3oard.     The work in view includes the formulation and                                          variation/
variation as oircumstances may require of the generalregulations governing the sale and supply of intoxicatingliquor in licensed premises and clubs, the considerationof the exemptions, etcM v/hioh may be allowed, and theadministration on behalf of tho State :f the direct controlareas.    his work appears to the Committee to require that men of varied and practical experience should take part in itmerely as an Advisory Gommittee to a departmentaladministration, but as part of an exocutive authority andin direct personal touch with the Minister responsible toParliament for the work of the Authority,     This Minister should, in the opinion of the Committee,be the chairman or President of the now Authority, andshould be a member of the Government whoso other duties should not be of such a nature as to prevent him from being in-constant touch with the current work of theAuthority and from presiding regularly over its deliberations                                            i     The Committee are strongly of opinion that tho longerpermanent legislation is delayed the greater will be therisk of a total loss of the advantages gained during thewar.   They believe that tho large moasuro of agreementexisting between the various elements of the Board has its                                   counterpart/
                 -4-                                   244counterpart in public opinion generally.  The committee recommend that a measure to place on a permanent basisthose regulations which secured greatly increased sobiiotyduring the war, should be brought before Parliament withthe least possible delay..   They consider that theAuthority suggested in this Report might be of servicetc the Government in the framing of such a measure ofpermanent legislation.
