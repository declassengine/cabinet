SECRET.            &apos;&apos;\                     THE CABINET.U.P.   21285CQMOENTRATION OF  GOVERNMENT  LAND VALUATION.MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR WAR AND AIR,                  AND THE  MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.    1.  There is, at the present moment, a very large amount of work  outstanding in Gen connection with : -                                                               1     (a.) Compensation payable  to  owners  and others in respect of land and buildings           occupied by the Government for war purposes.     (b.)  The disposal of factories and other  buildings erected at the public  expense for           war purposes, and the purchase  (where  necessary)  of  the  sites of  such           factories and buildings with a  view to their  disposal.  The interests  at           stake amount  to many million sterling.     2. Among the  causes  which  have mainly contributed to this large amount  of outstanding work are :      As to 1 (a)          The doubts existing as to the legal position while the final decision in the             de Keyser Hotel  case was pending;  the  unavoidable suspensions  of             compensation work between  the date  of that decision and the passing             of the Indemnity Act, and tho re-adjustment of machinery and procedure             necessitated by the provisions of the Act.     As to 1 (&amp;)-         The complicated nature  of the transactions themselves and certain defects             which experience  has shown to exist  in  the Defence of the Realm             (Acquisition of  Land) Act, 1916, to remedy which a Bill has recently             been introduced  in the House  of Lords.     3. The work is at present being carried out by the following  Departments : &apos;     As to 1 (a)           (i.) The Lands  Directorate acting  on behalf of the War  Department, Air               Ministry,  Ministry of Munitions and Ministry of  Labour.         (ii.)  The Inland  Revenue Valuation Department acting  on behalf of the               Admiralty.        (iii.) The Office of Works acting in cases where premises have been taken for .               accommodating the staffs of Government Departments.     Subject, of course, in  all  cases where  Defence  of the Realm powers have  been exercised and the compensation exceeds a certain amount, to the final determination  ofthe War  Compensation Court,         As to 1 (&amp;.) The Lands Directorate, acting on behalf of  the Disposal Board of             the Ministry of Munitions.     4. The bulk of the work,  therefore, is being carried out by the Lands Directorateunder Sir Howard Frank,  Bt.,  K.C.B., with  the assistance of an expert  staff consistingof gentlemen of high standing in  their profession, many of whom  are anxious to returnto their own business as soon as possible, and are continuing to give their  services tothe Government from a sense of  duty and a  desire  to  carry, through  the variouscomplicated transactions on which they  are engaged.     5. It is estimated that a period&apos; of 3  years or  more will  be  required for  the .completion of the work in  question and in these circumstances  it  is most  desirablethat some definite arrangements should be made which will render it possible to retain the, services of the staff required for the  completion of the work in hand.     6. A suggestion  has  been made by the  Chancellor  of the  Exchequer, based ona report of the Banbury Committee, that the work in question might be transferred to    (B20/456) 100 11/20  H&amp;S,  Ltd.  8704wo
 the Inland Kevenue Valuation Department, and that the  latter Department should become a  Central  Valuation Department  responsible for  all  purchases,  sales and valuations on behalf of all other Government Departments.      7. To these proposals we are convinced, after full and. careful consideration, that there are the following very grave objections :       (a.)  The Inland  Revenue Valuation Department, as at present organized, would            be quite incapable of carrying, out the work,  because they have little or no            experience of the extremely difficult and complicated  negotiations involved            in transactions  of the magnitude of many of those which are being dealt            with by the Lands Directorate.      (b.)  It would be impossible to carry out satisfactorily much of the work  on which            the Lands Directorate is engaged, unless  the  services  of the present  staff            or the better part of it can  be retained, a  result which, we are satisfied            after careful enquiry, could not be attained if  the work is to  be transferred            to the Inland Revenue Valuation Department.      (c.)  Whilst appreciating the work which the Inland Revenue Valuation Department            have carried out in the past, we feel bound to  point  out that their work            has been  almost entirely connected with  the valuation of property.  The            work of the Lands Directorate, however, both  on  behalf of the Departments            it represents and for the Disposal Board, is of an administrative kind, and            includes negotiating the purchase and sale of every  class of property, as            well as  the disposal and valuation of machinery,  camps, aerodromes, huts            and buildings of every description, &amp;c.      8. We are fully alive to the desirability of concentrating  in  one Department  all the Government Valuation work.   We  think that the principle should be carried  even further and that the same Department should be responsible for managing the bulk of the property owned by Government Departments with certain  exceptions set out more fully below.   We further think that it would be advisable to  dissociate the Department as far as possible from the controversies that have grown up around the Inland Revenue Valuation Department.     If such a Department were formed we think  there would be no  great difficulty in transferring to  it the work performed  by  the Lands Directorate  and described  in paragraph 1 (a) and (6), as it would  probably, in  that case,  be possible  to retain the services of many of the best men in the Directorate.     9. The scheme which we should suggest as  the  most  satisfactory  solution, both of the problem of providing for the  permanent concentration of valuation  and other work  connected with  Government lands  in our  Department  and of that of ensuring the satisfactory completion of  the  emergency  work  described  in  paragraph  1, is  the  absorption  of  the  Lands   Directorate,  the  work in  connection  with offices  in  the  Office of  Works,  the  Office   of   Woods  and  Forests  and  the Inland Revenue Valuation Department, in one of the. existing  Government Departments, e.g., the Office of Works or the Board of trade^lwould be  responsible for carrying&quot;out all work on behalf of the Government  in  connection with the  sale, purchase, management  and  valuation of  lands  and buildings with  the  exception  of the management of lands held by the Admiralty, War Department or Air  Ministry which, being subject to &quot; military&quot; user, can  only be conveniently  administered  by  those Departments.     We think that such a scheme would result in increased efficiency and considerable economy and the scheme being one of concentration and  absorption would not  be open to objection on the ground that it  involved the creation of a new Department.     There  is reason to believe that the Government might  continue  to  have the advantage of the unique  experience and great influence with the civil profession  of Sir Howard Frank in the formulation of a scheme  on the above lines.                                                                     w.  s. c.                                                                     I.     November, 1920.
