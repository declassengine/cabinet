I o r - ^CM 21 06         &quot;Memorandum by the Shipping OontrOller\-&quot;&quot;^&quot;&quot;W^.         WHAM&quot;ii.......      ........... .... ..... &apos;             ^.  ,    f k*\\      Si P i Ei I I 0 H..-^*Ti           Under paragraph 5  of Annex  ill  of Part VIII  of  the peace tfrea^y* Germany agrees as an additional part  of Reparation,  to  cause Merchant ships to be built in German  yards for the account  of the Allied and Associated Governments up  to a maximum of 200,000 tons gross- in each of the first live years after the ooming in force of the Treaty.           The British share of the first yearTs building  (the total of which has been reduced by agreement between the Germans and  the Reparation Commission to 186,000 tons) would be about  100,000 tons gross,  and it is necessary to decide now whether Great Britain will take  up her share  and have this tonnage built.           It is reparation in kind and, therefore,  reparation in its most valuable  form and ought  to bring in about  a million and a  half pounds to the Exchequer.    Moreover,  if we  do not have this  tonnage  built  for  British account there  is a  strong probability that  the French  and  Italians  would  have it built for French and Italian account, so  that  our  withdrawal would  not benefit Germany.           QJhe possible  objections  are  that we  might  have to credit Germany with  more than  the  tonnage  will sell for when delivered, and that Labour may  say  that  it is  a wrong thing for the  Government  to get tonnage built for the  British Mercantile Marine  in German Yards at  a  time when British Shipyards are threatened with unemployment.          On  the first point,  it is  thought  it would  be very difficult for  Germany to  claim  orecit  for  more than  the fair market price of the  ships at the  time  of delivery just as they are  gettingno?/ and the ^chequer will in any case  get a large sum  in hard oash.          Of  course,  if Britain would  really receive  oash from Germany if she did not take the ships  the position would  be  different,  Kbut it is here assumed that ultimately  Britain  is not  likely  to                                                         get
.-;et anything like a full share of her indemnity and so it seemswise to take everything obtainable in !!rindf *          On the second appointed, it is to be remembered that theships will be built in any case whatever we do,, and the only question is whether they should.form part of the British MercantileMarine and so $ive employment to&apos; a certain number of Officers andseamen or be used against us by oar compel:], tors ft 1          On the whole the Shipping Controller recommends&apos; that weshould have- this tonnage built for British account:  but if it isnecessary for the Allies as a whole to make any concession toGermany in the matter of shipping reparation,., he would suggestthat the Allies should forego the right to have ships built inGermany, iy, I/, u
