AIR MINISTRY,372283/20/3.6.                                    London,  Y/.C2.                                           20th November,  1920.Sir,      I am commanded by the Air Couaoil to acknowledge thereceipt of Sir Maurice Ha.n^ey!s letter of November 9th relativet.a.&apos;.t.He. furbishing of a report for the information of the.,..,.representatives of the United Kingdom at the forthcoming Assemblyof the League of Nations as to the extent to whioh Germany &apos;hascarried out her obligations, under the Treaty of. Versailles.   2.  With the exception of hydrogen plant and hangers, thodelivery and destruction of which,- in accordance with anarrangement made at the Spa Conference on July 9th, 1926, is notrequired before the 15th February, 1921, Germany may be said, tohave fulfilled tie obligations whioh she, in the view of tho  air council, undertooJc in the Treaty of Versailles, in so ,far as theair clauses are concerned, inasmuch as all the personnel of themilitary and naval Air li&apos;orce have been demobilised, and praotioallyall -the war machines have been destroyed or surrendered.   Thefollowing figures show.the position of .the delivery and destructionof Ge rraan a i rc r aft up to the 30th Octo be r:-             Delivery:477 aeroplanes.                           58 seaplanes.                            4 airships.                         2886 engines.
          Destroyed;-   14255  aeroplanes  and  seaplanes.                           2  airships.                        3276  engines *        Considerable delay has  been  noticeable on  the part of the  Garment Government  in  delivering  lists of  the.  Kite Balloon material  which  is  in thoir possession;   a commencement has, however,  now  been  made  with  its destruction.   3.   Spoflucing  generally, the President of the Inter-Allied Aeronautical  OommioSion of Control has  expressed  himself as satisfied that the German Government are showing  a real desire  to carry  out tho provisions of the Treaty  of Versailles in so far as  the question of aerial  disarmament is concerned.   4.   Owing  to  their mobility, it is easy for ovilly dis- posed individuals  to remove and export  aircraft and thus esca e  the  vigilance of the authorities.  On arrival in Germany,  the  German Government provided the Inter-Allied Aeronautical  Commission of Control with a list of aeroplanes, seaplanes  and other aeronautical material in the possession of German  nationals.  Later,  the Commission frequently found, on arrival  at an aerodrome, that machines were actually at that moment being flown away to an unknown destination -machines  the  presence of which had been previously confirmed by Allied  officers.       From this it is  clear that a number of machines vere flown to  foreign countries, Horvwy,  Sweden,  Denmark, Holland, :.otc., without the  approval or consent of the Berlin Govern-ment.  In  January  last  the Council of iimbassadors  passed a resolution enacting that the  German Government *ould becalled upon to recompense the Allied Governments for any military or naval aire.aft exported abroad.   At the end ofAugust last the German  Government paid the sum of  50 millionmar^s in lieu of the 1,000 -  1,500 machines which  were alleged to nave been tjent abroad.
The Secretary to the Cabinet,      2 Whitehall Gardens,               q  &apos;&apos;  i       Tho Gorman Government have further draftedlegislation forbidding tho export of war material andenforcing fines for all who should be found guilty of having omitted, to deliver arras, aircraft and other warmaterial.   5.  Tho Gorman Government have on several occasionsclaimed tnat the destract ion of all the hangars stipulatedin the Treaty of Peace would involve groat hardship falling on Jordan industry.  The Council of -ambassadors agreedthat tho Commission oi? Control should decide what hangarsmight bo purchased by German nationals.   6.  A small proportion of concealed material is believedstill to exist, and that and otnor minor questions are stillengaging tho attention of tho Commission of Control w. ichis continuing its labours in Geroany.   7.  At tho time of the ratifioation of the Peace Treaty,it was estimated that tnero were in Germany 15.000 aeroplanes.and seaplanes and 8 airships.  Of these 85$ of the aero-planes and. seaplanes have been surrendered or destroyedunder Allie- supervision, while 6 airships have beonsurrendered, one is awaiting destruction by the Alliesand one is being prepared for flight to Italy.                            I am,                               Sir,     &apos;                      Your obedient Servant,                    ( Signed)   17* MIC HOLS ON.
