Jtomoranfdurn^ by^ the Chancellor  of  tho^ Exchequer.              (Reference  Cabinot 2(20)  Conclusion  (3)),                         t f ( M M I I I      Shortly  before  the  meeting of the Supreme Economic Council  in &quot;Paris  in  January  1920 and  in  view of its being the  turn of the British  Government  to  invite the  Council to meet  afterwards in  -London,  I drew  the attention of my  - colleagues to the necessity  for defining tho British policy in regard to  the  continuance of the Supreme  Economic Council, The  Cabinet at its meeting  on  the  7th  January approved the proposal which, inter  alia,  I  then  put forward that the British  Delegate  should  submit to  the  Council in  Paris a proposal that &quot;the Supreme Economic Council  should not be formally abolished but that  no further plenary meetings should be held pending a decision  &quot;by  the League of Nations as to the formation  of an Economic  section  of tho League&quot;,      Since the meeting of the  Council  in Paris in January and  February  its  work  has been carried on by a Permanent Committee of  the  Council, the  Council  itself having thus virtually ceased  to  exist.   Thy oullc  of  the  work  of the Permanent Committee  consists in the consideration of trade relations with Russia, whilst  the  other  questions with which it deals can  quite woll  be dealt with  by the appropriated departments of the Governments represented  on the Committee.-      The Council  of  the  League of  nations has now taken up the  question  of its  economic and financial  organisation, and has  decided to appoint immediately  a provisional  Financial and  Economic  Consultative Committee.   The British Government has  nominated Sir Hubert Llewellyn  Smith as  the British                                          representative
representative on tho Economic Section oi this Committeeand IvdrB,P.

The Permanent Committee of the Supreme economic council is an Inter-Allied body.   The question of itsdiscontinuance should therefore be taken up with the Allies^I sugrvest that Lord Derby should be instructed formally to propose its dissolution at a meeting of tho Ambassadors&apos;Conference,     I have consulted tho President of the Board of Tradewho fully concurs in this proposal,                       (Intd.J A.C,Treasury Chambers,November 17th, 1920,
