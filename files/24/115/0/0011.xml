GENERAL.     The  exceptional unemployment  produced by  the coal strike  is  gradually subsiding, but in many  cases employers will be unable to resume work for another week.  Apart from the effects of the  strike, unemployment continues on a serious scale in London, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and  in a few towns in the south-west of England and Scotland.   The serious  depression in  the cotton,  woollen,  wholesale clothing,  and leather industries remains unchanged.  Some improvement in cheap boot  trade is reported.     Considerable slackness still prevails in ship-building, engineering, and iron and steel trades, but some slight revival in the motor industry is expected shortly.  Apart from this there are at present no signs of any  revival in these industries. Several engineering firms report difficulty in securing loans from banks.     Work on the Arterial Road Schemes has now commenced in a few areas.                         II. EMERGENCY  WORK.     The Prime Minister made a statement in the  House  of   Commons on  the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes  for  employing a large number  of  fit ex-Service men  in connection with  the  Housing Programme,  on  which negotiations with the  trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for arterial roads in  London and in the provinces; whilst  at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports  programme  of road  classification andmaintenance grants.                       ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.              (Information supplied by the Ministry of Transport.)                       I. London Arterial New Roads.    Negotiations for the following  arterial road schemes in the London area are inprogress:     (1.)

Unemployment continues serious  in London, and settlement of coal strike has produced little improvement as yet.

No definite agreement hasbeen reached in shipwrights&apos; dispute but improved demand  for labour in local ship-building  yards reported  at  Birkenhead.   Increasing unemployment among cotton  joperatives at  Blackburn: partly due to coal strike and partly to shortage of cottonsupplies.   Slight  revival in cotton  industry  at Darwen &quot;but this improvementexpected  to be temporary.   Cotton trade generally  still affected  by difficulties  offoreign exchange.  Short-time working  still general  in engineering; shortage  of
oelectrical supply partly responsible for this.
