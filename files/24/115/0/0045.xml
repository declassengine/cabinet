(gfltgJlQngfiL- First Interim Report (Paper CP,-1907) ) .IIG LABOUR.,   (1)  Negotiations  for the admission of ex-Service men         into the Building Trade were begun as far bash as July, 1919,         and have proceeded intermittently  ever since.   On June 16,         1920,  the Cabinet appointed a Housing Committee,  with the         President of the Board of Trade as Chairman,  and its Report         (Paper  CP,-159 3) was  circulated on July 14,  and approved         by  the  Cabinet  on July 29.   This Report,  inter aiiaT maete         proposals for increasing the supply o^ labour  for house         building by  grading up unskilled men,  increasing  the number         of  apprentices  and training ex-Service men between the ages         of  22 and 26 inclusive,  together with proposals  for payment         by  results.   These proposals wer*  presented to the Building         Resettlement Committee,  and their  acceptance pressed for         in  return for a guarantee  or some  payment  in respect of time         lost by  stress  of weather.   The  Building Resettlement Com-         mittee were  unwilling  to accept  these  proposals.   Payment by         results  was  summarily  rejected.  The  Committee submitted         counter-proposals  for  augmentation, which  were limited to the         resumption of ordinary apprenticeship and  the  admission .of         adult apprentices up to  the age  of 26,   They proposed that         arrangements for payment for time  lost due to  stress of         weather  should  be left to  be settled  between the  employers B 0,11 E T -0.P.--3145.
 and the employed,  These counters-proposals were accepted by the Housing Committee,  with the distinct statement that they were regarded an inadequate and that it was to be open to the Government to press for further proposals  if these proved ineffective,    The  employers and  employed  on the Resettlement Committee endeavoured to otme to  an  agreement  on  &quot;wet time&quot;;   the em-              i ployers *v*ra  willing  to  concede  payment  for 50  per cent,  of time lost;   the  operatives  pressed for  75  per  cent,, and  a deadlock ensued.  The Minister of Health called the Resettle-ment Committee together in  trder to  try to  secure  some  agree-ment;  this attempt failed, but Dr Addison  announced that hewould be prepared to put into operation on Houcing Schemes a compromise with regard to wet time if the other proposals of the Resettlement Committee were adopted, by accepting    percent, for the  first 22 hours lost in a week, with 75 per cent.for hours lost beyond that number.  It was understood thatthe employers would acquiesce in this decision of the Minister--of Health,   On October 6, 1920, the Unions were invited to submit thewhole of the proposals to their members, and this is beingdene.   The general body of building employers have since held aspecial meeting of their Federation,  and have protestedstrongly against any arrangement for payment for wet time.^he Minister of Health proposes to tell the employers that hewill feel bound,i^  the Unions accept  the whole scheme of the resettlement Committee, to  put in force his wet time compromise-mise on Housing  Schemes,   Cn August 13, the Ou-binet appointed a Committee on Uneiu-ployruont, which  presented its First Report  on October 1, 1320 (Paper CP.-190?),  It deal4&quot; mainly with schemes  for the construction of  arterial roads in Greater  London,  and sometf these schemes are now being put into operation. Arrange-ments have also been i.*ade by tho Vinister  of Health to                            - *-
 anticipate road and newer work &apos;or housing schemes &quot;all r2A9 London.   The Co-mitt^ has subsequently examine closely  the possibility of absorbing 50,000 ivx-Sorvice men on skilled work on  housing Schemes  which  should be specially  earmarked rnT pr^different^l treatment for ox-S-rvico  men.   This&quot; number, which would be  inclusive of the  adult apprentices  admitted under the  Building  Resettlement  Scheme,  would  leao/to the employment of  thft retire&amp;Live unskilled men to the  extent  of 75,000.    The Minister of  Health wrote  to the  Unions  on October  83, 1920,  stating  that  the vi*w of the Government was  that  tho number of  skilled men in,the building trades should be  aug*- merited by  50,000, with preference for ex-Service men.   He then 3aw the Unions on November 3,  and was informed by  them that their  acceptance of the proposal would depend on the conditions which could be  obtained by their existing members as  a sa^rmard  aaalnst future unemployment arising out of the proposed augmentation.    In  securing  the acceptance hj the Unions of this proposalit  is necessary to overcome&apos; their objection to dilution and the deep-rooted&apos; and widespread fear of unemploy ent.   TheCommittee have examined a  large number of alternative schemes in  consultation with the Government Actuary.  A majority ofthe Committee consider it to be expedient that, directly or indirectly, the Government should accept some  responsibilityfor the increase of unemployment attributable  to the  dilutionof building labour which it U proposed to impose upon theUnions.  It is difficult to ariivo  at satisfactory figureso**  the average rate of unemployment in the various branchesof  the industry, and in some sections the amount of dilutionwill be so  small as to be negligible.  It is therefore pro-posed, in the first of the  alternatives mentioned below, to restrict the Governments responsibility to three groups,namely, Bricklayers,Plasterers, and Slaters.and Tilers.In  these cases  the percentage cfdilution will  be substantial,   The alternative proposals which  the Committee submit to the Cabinet are as follows:-
(1)  (a)  For tho purpose of protecting  th**ir    funds  the  Building  Trade  smilled&quot;Unions    above-mentioned  are entitled  to oo- pensa-    tion to  the extent  to  whioh,  an a  result    of the  introduction of ex-Service  man  the    average  rate of  unemployment  for any of    the  ten  years beginning 1st January, 1921    is in excess of  tho  &quot;standard rate&quot; in    each section of  the building industry    to which the offer applies:&quot;    (b)  That this offer of compensation shall   be confined to  the bricklayers,  plasterers,   slaters and tilers:   that the maximum   payment should  be 10/- per week over and   above the 15/-  a week drawn under  the  Unemployment Insurance Act,  and  should  be   Paid  only in respect of those  members of   the Trade Unions  who are In receipt of  benefit  under the Insurance  Act  and who  claim it  through  the Trade Unions:   (c) The  &quot;standard rate  of  unemployment&quot;  should be arrived at by taking one-half  of the average gross  rates of unemployment  of the Unions concerned for  the  five years&quot;  1909-1913.   The resulting  standard  rates  are:-     for Bricklayers, one-half  of 1Z%  *- &amp;h%     &quot;  Plasterers,    &quot;    &quot;    &quot;  19$  * 9%%  &apos;     w  Slaters and   &quot;    &quot;    M  15%        Tilers  On two alternative assur -ptions as to the  total unemployment rat-s Sir Alfred  Watson  estimates that the total cost of the Scheme  for any year, und&apos;.r  the above conditions,  will  be as follows&apos;.-Total unemployment rate-Bricklayers.  ]  Plasterers.Slaters andTilers,_____^Total cost bothe State in ayear.12-J; per cent, i   16 per cent   14 per cent15    ............ i   m    . JL___12_L-JL -  The second alternative is as follows   (II) In order to induce the Unions  to accept       dilution, the Unions  affected shall  be       asked to&apos;create a reserve fund  to meet       the burden of additional  unemployment,       whether of existing members or  dilutees,       such reserve fund for three years to be       provided by the contributions of ex-       Service dilutees.   These  dilutees on       becoming  members of the Unions  will       pay not&apos;only the ordinary membership       contribution,  but an  additional 50 per       cent,,  which 50 per cent,  they  will  receive       from the  State, over  and  above  their weekly       wage.      (The initial wage it is proposed to pay       these  ex-Service men  is 55 per  cent,  of       the skilled wage,  but  some members of       the Committee think this  figure too  low       to be- attractive,.and that it may be       necessary to go up to 75  per cent,)                       -4- 105,100
        In the opinion of tho Committee  it  should bo  a part of the  agr*m&quot;*nt  with the Trades  Unions  that  some body shall be constituted, or  the  existing machinery  improved,  for set- tling demarcation disputes  rapidly  as they arise.  There are at present  a  numb&apos;;...  of  arbitrary  restrictions, which are causing  delay  in  the progress  of  housing schemes, which should be suspended.       If the  Cabinet approve  either of these offers beingmade by  the Ministry  of Labour to the men&apos;a representatives, the offer will be made,   and,  if  refused,  it is&apos; proposed tomake public the refusal and make  an appeal  to skilled men to volunteer to  teach the dilutees upon the special Ring-fencebuilding schemes which a:-e ready  to be put  in operation by the Ministry of Health,   If the offer is accepted,  no trouble with the Trade Unions is  anticipated, but a strike  would pro-bably follow an endeavour to force the schemes without agree-ment, or the men may slow down their pace,  or leave thehousing  schemes, and in these  eventualities the activeassistance of the Local Authorities cannot  be counted on by th&quot; Gov^rnm^nt,
IMBNOB       (2) Th6 attention of th0 Committee has been drawn to theOffiS.      fact that, in the event of the Building Programme being           accelerated for the purpose of providing relief for unem-           plorent,  Local Authorities will require money for housing           in anticipation of their borrowing  arrangements,  which have           been  made  on  the basis  of the  building  programme  being  spread           over  a  much long-., r period.                  In  the  case of th London County  Council and other           Authorities, a  further 4j millions  sterling may be required           over  and above  existing  commitments of 5 millions.  It  is           understood  that  the London  County Council would have no           difficulty  in raising the necessary money, provided the           Treasury are willing to  finance  them in  the interval.                 Attention has also been called to the special-^irrrum-*\           stances of  Edmonton District Council, whose housing programme&quot;&quot;          has been financed out of an allotment from the Houoing Bond          Issue of the Middlesex County Council.   It is  unlikely that          the G-oschen Committee will sanction another issue of the          Middlesex County Council for some months, and in consequence          protracted negotiation will bo necessary to induce the latter          body to undertake a fresh liability even if financed in the           Interval by the Treasury,  In the meantime both unemployment          and the shortage of houses is very serious&quot; in Edmonton,  but           the Edmonton Local Authorities cannot proceed with an accel-          erated housing scheme until they are assured that the money          required will  be forthcoming.                 The CoiUnittee accordingly record end                   (a) That  the Treasury should undertake to                   finance the London County Council and                   other Authorities in anticipation of                   their bee:-owing the additional  4                    millions  required,  which it was esti-                   msted would &quot;bo spent within IS  months                   after the convene em nt of the work:               (b) That  an assurance be given to the Edmonton                   Local District Council that the money re-                   quired for the acceleration of their build-                   ing programme would be  forthcoming either                   through a special  issue of the Middlesex                   County Council Housing  Stock or otherwise,                   the Treasury advancing the money in the                   meanwhile.
)0OKY&quot;ARD                                                      &quot;...213    (S)  The Committee have considnred certain proposals put forward by tho Admiralty for alleviating unemployment in Dockyard towns.   The Admiralty., since the Armistice, have been  reducing numbers at varying rates, which, reached 80 per week  at the  end  of October,  since when it is proposed that the reductions shall continue at th? ordinary  rate of wastage, i.e., about  40 per week.   The Admiral   state  that they could usefully  employ up to  a  maximum of 2,000 men scraping andpainting  ships, at -an  estimated cost of  200,000 for labouralone during the present  financial  year,  but that this  sumcannot be  found out  of the Naval Estimates.  Paint can  beprovided out  of stock.

At  present Overseas  Settlers  are assisted by the  Kxohe-              ouer with free passages for ex-Service men and wtaien, and by              grants from the National Relief  Fund  to those who have  suffer-              ed direct hardship as a result of the  /ar.  As at present             arranged.applications for  free passages must be sent inftefore              uece-ber Slot next, and the whole of the National Relief Fund             has been allocated.  The funds in the hands  of the Overseas             Settlement Committee will  probably last till the end  of  this             calendar year, and  no funds are available  after that  date.                   The Committee reeoiumend -                  (a) That  the time  for  receiving applications                     from  ex-Service men and  women for free                     passages should be extended for one  year?                  (b) Tiab  grants  in  aid of settlement within  the                     Empire should be placed  at  the disposal  of                     the Overseas Settlement  Committee insofar                     as they may  prove  to  be  required, at  a rate                     not exceeding  50,000 a  month from January 1,                     1931, to March SI,  1921,  with preference to                     ex-Service men:                  (o) That  the Colonial  Office, after negotiation                     with  the Dominions, should  formulate  a scheme                     o^ assisted  emigration on s large scale,  for                     submission to the  Cabinet.fATItNAL         (5) The Committee have reviewed the position- of the1/10 TORIES,             National Paotorles  at Woolwich, Rnfield and Gretna^ in relive             tion  to the problem of unemployment  and to the possible             manufacture of housing equipment,  railway wagons  and, other             articles of which there is  a eerious shortage  at  the present             time*  ^heir views, with special  reference to Woolwich,  have            been  circulated to  the Cabinet in a  Pa^oer prepared by the             Chairman of the Committee (C.P.-2095).  They  wish, in addi-             tion, to make  the following recommendations  to the Cabinet:-                  (a) That  the Cabinet decision on May  19,  19                      (Cabinet 29  [20) Conclusion 2), that finan-                     cial  loss  on engineering orders is  to be                     a^ded, should&apos; be amended  to the effect                     that  the war Office may  be  authorised to                                        -ft-
