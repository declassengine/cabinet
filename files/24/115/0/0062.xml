(TfTIS. DOqUlBMT  IS TK3 PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY18 GOWRlOTfT&apos;.)SBCHST,C P, 2162,CA3I3SJ5T.Amended.       SECOND gTJRjg .3SP0RT OP UBgLOYlCTT  CO&amp;aTTaB.                Memorandums the  Pirst Commissioner  of..Works *                       (Reference CP.&apos; 214j?).        I wish to draw the Cabinet&apos;3 attention to the followingpoints arising out of the llajority Report of the UntmploymentCommittee.        If the Cabinet accept either of the alternatives,  ofwhich I strongly favour the first, I feel very doubtful as towhether it will, be found sufficiently attractive for the Unions^to accept/       . Having been present at the first negotiations on thisquestion with the Trade Union Representatives, I was much impressed by this point Q .: view of theirs, that their existing members demanded to be protected from being unemployed, and werenot anxious to receive Unemployment Benefit at all.        This benefit must be so small in comparison with thenormal wage they receive while employed as barely to reacn&quot; thesustenation level.                                               that        A very strong point was therefore ma de/In returnfor greater unemployment risks incurred by the present membersof the Unions under the. proposed dilution, a Grant-in-Aid of asubstantial Increase to the ordinary Unemployment Benefit shouldbe given to existing members in some form to be worked out.        I therefore&apos;think that the ^ommittee^s proposals wouldhave to be supplemented if agreement is to be reached, possibly tcombination of the two proposals would tend towards this object.        As my Department will&apos;be  mailed in to carry out theCabinet1s decision on the proposed &quot;Ring Pence&quot; Schemes, either with agreement or without, I feel I&apos;must fully place the probableresults of these two alternatives before my colleagues.
     If agreement with the Unions  is reached  the followingresults will he obtained:-     (A) exist in&quot;-Housing Schemes  will  proceed  normally    - (B). All Government work of  importance  will continue.     (C) Local Authorities  and Contractors  are  fairly            certain to attempt to  operate the scheme.     (D) it must be under-toed that  the proposed dilutees            are all unskilled men,  and  it is  only  bp- agree-            toent that it i s at all likely that  the necessary            number cf qualified instructors will be obtained            by means cf Trace Union  co-operation.   I am            advised that the minimum number of  Instructors            is one to four in the  best  case,  but in some trade            practically one to one.   That, a large  number of           : instructors are required for 50,000 men becomes,            therefore, self-evident.     (?) The Trainees will become  member- of  the respective            Craft Unions and so will  have a much greater            prospect of permanent  employment  in. their           - industry than if they  remained  outside the Unions.         If no agreement is reached the following  resuits.arelikely  :--(a) - A  general strike may occur in the  whole  Building     industry.   (This is the least cf the possible     di eadvantages,)(b)  The Rousing schemes now in course  of  erection may be     boycotted,  the skilled men engaged upon them  finding     employment  in other building and construction works     where sufficient demand to absorb  the  large majority     of the skilled tradesmen exists unless drastic pro-     visions are. made to restrict  other forms of building.(c)  No actual withholding of Labour mi ht  arise,  but  a     consistent  &quot;ca1canny&quot; policy on all Government     Housing work  would be followed,  resulting in     vastly increased cost te the Government.( d)  Few,  if any, local Authorities .or Contractors are     at. all likely, to attempt to operate, the scheme with     unskilled ex-service men, and so lose  the  skilled     men which they have at work-en their present  scheme.     A  &quot;fin-.: fenced&quot;  scheme was discussed based on the  sup--position that Local Authorities will allow the office  ofWorks to build&apos; for them&apos;as their Contractors.  If  the LocalAuthorities do not agree, and one  important Authority  fromthis point of  view namely Woolwich, has already declinedu ni e s s
unless Trade Union assent is secured,  the whole &quot;burden must therefore fall upon my Department.    The Government  then wouldhave to undertake the whole financial &quot;burden and introduce the principle of direct, Government  House-building and owner-ship, unless the Houses when built  could be forced upon theLocal Authoritiesc        I am advised that it would prove impossible  toprovide all the Instructors necessary to train the $0,000 menunder the Scheme, although a certain number of Instructorsmight be obtained b  a popular appeal.        I would point out that in any case so far as thetraining of unskilled ex-Serviee men is concerned the processof abesrption must  necessarily be 3low and gradual^        Intensely difficult if we obtain the co-operation ofLocal Authorities,  Contractors, and the Building TradeUnions, it becomes very doubtful whether it is worth tryingwithout this.        I have no wish to ask my Officers to undertake a task which I fear would not in these circumstances reflect crediteither on my Department or on the Government0                     (Signed)    ALOTSD MOIID.Office of Works,        24th November,  1920.
