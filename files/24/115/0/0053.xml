This Document is  the Property o1y//[.y  jt&amp;ii&amp;/u&amp;           His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government             4Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.O.P.^ 2 15 3   )  ))              THE  EAST.^^&apos;;J-^CTllure to  draw the attention of  my  colleagues to the very serious situation in the East arising out of the Treaty of Peace.     As my colleagues will remember, I did my best to persuade the Govern- ment to advocate a different Treaty, and  I foresaw most of what  I feel to be the consequences of the Treaty as it was signed.  Since then I have done my best to regard the Treaty as unalterable,  and  I have told the Government of India, and  through them, Indians, that  they must accept it as  a decision arrived at, as  I admit, with  a full  consideration of their views.  But the situation in the East looks like prolonged warfare of the kind  that  Lord Allenby  predicted.  Armenia  is  helpless unless the  Bolsheviks help  her. Turkey has practically ceased to  exist, and  the combination of  Islam with Bolshevism is an increasing menace and peril to  British interests.  We have decided to conclude an agreement with the Bolsheviks for many reasons, but one of them being, I understand, a belief  that  a prosperous Russia will throw off Bolshevism.  Surely that principle can be further applied. Bolshevism, it is argued, cannot succeed unless it has something to batten on.  Remove the causes of  discontent, not  only inside Russia, but outside Russia, and Bolshevism will lose its influence.   So little will help the  situation.  We are all hopeful that if we conclude an agreement with the Bolsheviks their propaganda will cease.  Surely it is  even more hopeful to  make countries which they are attacking with their propaganda, impervious to it.  Cannot we do it in the case of Islam and Turkey  herself ?     I would not have suggested this if it were not that the Greece for whose benefit the Treaty was made,  has disappeared,  and I  should have thought that we had to some  extent a free hand to reconsider its decisions.  I know this is the view taken in Italy where all the information I get shows me that Mustafa  Kernel is receiving much  support, and  I have reason to believe it may  be the attitude in France.     22nd  November 1920.
