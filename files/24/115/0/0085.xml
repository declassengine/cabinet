LICENCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES*               Memorandum by the Secretary of State for, the Colonies.           Following on the meeting of the Conference of Ministers       in Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Room 6n Tuesuayf November 9th, at which I       was requested to see Mr. Godfrey Isaacs and give him a general       indication of the intentions of the Government.  I had. an&apos;- &apos;       interview with that gentleman at the Colonial Office on tht       afternoon of Thursday, November llih.           I then told Mr. Isaacs that my reason for ,asking to see him       was that I understood he was leaving for America,, where he waa       going to have important negotiations with regard to wirelesis  s    \ communications with South i*mericat  and that it might be important       for him to know in this connection what.the views of His Majesty-3       Government were.  He replied &quot;that ii was very important, and       that the difficulty which his Company had always had was ^beir       uncertainty as to the policy of the Government,  and what       facilities they might expect in this Country for carrying out       a system of wireless communications on a large scale with the &apos;       outside world.           I then reminded Mr, Isaacs that at the conversation which      Mr. Bonar Law and I had had  with him and Sir Charles Jtewart       some weeks before at 11, Downing Street, which led to no      definite results,  the point  at which we had then broken off was      that,  while Mr.Bonar Law and I. were prepared on  the part of the      Government to promise to givo the Marconi Company licences for      stations to communicate with distant foreign countries, such as&apos;      Argentina and possibly the more remote parts oi  Europe/we Were      not prepared to give a similar undertaking with regard to all      European countries,  inasmuch as in this case the Marconj. Company                                                   would
would be competing with services already established by thePost Offioe.  Mr. Isaacs, on the other hand,  had contended that such an arrangement was unfair to the Marconi Company,inasmuch as we wanted therh to undertake the more distant and expensive services while Reserving1 others, where the expensewas less and the prospect of profit greater,  for the Government.Moreover, there was, as he stated, a danger of waste and confusionin having an excessive number of different stations.  If thewhole thing&quot; wad in a single hand a better general plan could beadopted which would make both for efficiency and economy..     I went on to say, that the Government had appointed aCommittee of Ministers with authority to deal with the whole matter, and that this Committee was now disposed to go further than Mr. Bonar Law and I felt able to go on the occasion justreferred to-  The, Committee were favourable to granting licences  tothe Marconi Company for communication with foreign countriesgenerally,  and not limiting- them to long distanoe communications.i/e had indeed no intention of granting a monopoly,  which Mr.Isaaos said at once that the Marconi Company did not ask for.All they wanted was to be allowed to erect stations for communi^cation with foreign countries generally, and  not to be limitedto certain countries-  I said that this was the point, on whichthe Government were now prepared to moot them, provided we could come to an understanding both (i) as to the terms on which licenceswere to be granted - about which I&quot; thought that in our previousconversation we had gone a long way towards agreement, and (ii) n amore diffioult matter - as to the1 various  outstanding claims ofthe Marconi Company against Government b apartments,. and the useof Marconi patents in the future..  I said.it was an impossible position for the Government to go on granting licences to the marconi Company and enabling them to extend their enterprise inevery direction, while the Company was at the same time constantlybringing actions against the Government, one of which was even now pending.  I said that we must have an absolutely clean slate                              -  2 -
in this matter, and a clear agreement as to the terms,  on whichall outstanding claims were to be settled,  to the completeexclusion of further litigation.  Mr. Isaacs said that  it wasa mistake to suppose that the Marconi 3ompany wore alwaysfighting Government Departments.  They were not at issue  with government Departments generally with regard to the use of theirpatents.  In most cases it was merely a question of ascertaining the facts, the rato at which the Company was to be compensated for tho use of its patents not being in dispute.   He admitted,however, that the Company was at issue with the Post Office, andthat a case was about to be brought into tho Courts. I repliedthat,  whether the differences between the Company and GovernmentDepartments were few or many, there must be an end of them, andthat a good understanding in that respect was a condition precedent to our undertaking to grant the Company the lioencesit might require for communication with foreign countriesgenerally.     Finally I told Mr.  Isaacs that,  with regard to wirelesscommunication with oertain foreign countries,  arrangements hadbeen made with the Governments of those countries which prevented/us from granting licences to private Companies,  without prior consultation with those Governments.   I said that I did&apos;not at the moment know exactly the extent of our obligation toforeign Governments in this respect,  but, whatever it was,  itwould  have to be respected,  and any undertaking we might  give to. the Company with regard to the granting of licences  must besubject to the limitation placed upon our freedom of action inthe matter by these agreements with foreign Governments-   Mr. .Isaacs said that he was aware of the arrangements referred to,but personally he did not think that the foreign Governmentsconcerned would raise any objection to our  granting lioences for communication with their countries to the Marconi Company.     I then asked Mr.  Isaacs whether&apos; the communication  I  had just made to him would, make any difference  to him in hisimpending negotiations in America  and in his plans for the
Colonial Office.    B7th November,  1920,future.  He said it would make a very groat difference.  He also said that his stay in America would be short.  He did not expect to be absent from this country more than three weeks,and he was very anxious, to bo allowed to enter into negotiationswith the Government on the lines I had indicated as soon as hegot back.     This, to the best of my recollection, is all that passedexcept that,  just before leaving,  Mr. Isaacs asked me whetherthe Government adhered to the policy of the &apos;Government-construnted-and-controlled Imperial Wireless system.  I replied in the &apos;affirmative.   Mr. Isaacs was evidently not very pleased withthis answer/er,  but he made no remark about it.                             (Intd.)   M.
