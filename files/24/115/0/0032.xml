We  have now considered  theinformation placed before  us  by Sir Benjamin  Robertson, who was deputed by us,with  the  consent  of the  Colonial Office,  to  visit East Africa and discuss Indianquestions with the authorities there.     2. We are constrained to say at the outset that it seems to us regrettable that decisions so far-reaching  in their effect, not  only on the Indian community in EastAfrica, but also on  the relations of India with the Empire generally, should have been arrived  at  before our representative had had an  opportunity of conferring with  thelocal authorities.  In your telegram  dated the  28th January 1920 you informed us that the Colonial Office considered that such a conference would be premature pendingthe proposed discussion in London between  Lord  Milner  and His Excellency  theGovernor of the East Africa Protectorate. His Excellency returned  to  Nairobi inJuly, and  Sir  Benjamin Robertson arrived there on the 10th August.   On the 9thAugust, however, Lord Milner&apos;s decisions were publicly announced by the Governor.Sir  Benjamin  Robertson  was  thus  confronted  with an  accomplished fact.   TheGovernor had  no authority to discuss with him the  main points in issue.   From theinformation which Sir Benjamin Robertson  has  placed before us we are forced to conclude that some, at any rate, of these decisions were reached without full realisation of the facts or of the  views of the Government of India.     3. In  our  Despatch No. 13, dated the 4th  June 1919, we recalled the principle which your predecessor pressed upon  the Colonial  Office  in 1914, that there  is no justification in a Crown Colony or Protectorate for assigning to  British Indians a status in any way inferior  to that of any other  class of His Majesty&apos;s subjects.  HisExcellency the  Viceroy, in  his  opening speech to the Indian Legislative Council onthe  30th January  last, and  again on  the  20th August, reiterated that this is,  and always will be, the position of the Government  of India.   We  observed with satis-faction that Lord Milner, in his speech in  the House of Lords on the 14th July last,appeared to accept this principle.   &quot;In East Africa,&quot; he said,  &quot; as in other  countries&quot; under the administration of  the Colonial Office, it has been the  avowed principle,&quot; and it is the definite intention  of the British authorities  to mete out even-handed&quot; justice between the different races inhabiting those territories.&quot;  But this does notappear  always  to  have  been the policy which has  been  followed.  In  reply  to adeputation  from the Nairobi  Indian  Association,  on the  24th March 1919,  HisExcellency the Governor  is reported to have said that  &quot; the principle  had been&quot; accepted at home that this country (British East Africa) was primarily ior European&quot; development, and whereas the interests of the Indians would not be.lost sight of,&quot; in all respects the European must  predominate.&quot;  This  was confirmed in letterNo. 15528-41, dated the 6th June 1919, from  the  Chief Secretary to the Governmentof the East Africa Protectorate to the  Indian  Association : &quot;His Excellency believes&quot; that though Indian interests should not be lost sight of, European interests must be&quot; paramount throughout the Protectorate.&quot;     4. At a mass meeting of Indians held  at Nairobi on the 22ncl August  to considerthe  announcement of Lord Milner Is decisions, a resolution was  passed  protesting against  assigning  an inferior  status to British  Indians  in  the East  african territories      (a)  by not granting them due and  effective representation on the Legislative  and           Municipal Councils;     (b)  by insisting  upon  the application of the principle of  segregation of races ;     (c)  by putting restrictions on ownership of land by them.     We propose in this Despatch to confine ourselves to consideration of these threevital issues.      2745    100+100  11.20             A
                                 The Franchise.     5. In para. 3 of the Despatch of  the  21st May,  Lord Milner states  that he hasdecided that arrangements shall be made for the election of  two Indian members  ofthe Legislative Council on a special franchise.  It is understood that the  LegislativeCouncil will then be composed as follows :      18 nominated officials, including the Arab Lawali of Mombasa;     11 elected Europeans;      2 elected Indians.     No authentic figures appear to be available  to show the comparative numbers ofthe European  and Indian population, their financial interests  in the country, and theamount of taxation  contributed by each community.  But it is understood  that it isnot in dispute that  by any of these tests the number of seats  allotted to  the Indiancommunity is  not proportionate to their importance.  In  his  speech in the House ofLords on the 14th July, Lord Milner laid stress on the fact that the majority remainsofficial, and  that the final decision, therefore, in  all  important matters of legislationreally rests with the Imperial authorities at home.  In these circumstances it seemedto him that the question of the number of elected representatives, and the method oftheir election, was  not of the first importance.  This  argument, however,  wouldappear to  apply  equally  to  European  representation.   We fully recognise thenecessity of  maintaining an official majority in order to safeguard the interests of the natives, who, as Lord Milner remarked in  his reply to Lord lslington&apos;s deputation onthe 3.9th April, are sometimes forgotten  in this  controversy.  But we would stronglyurge that  even-handed justice requires  that the representation of the European and indian communities, and the method of  election,  should be assimilated.   &quot; What is of vital importance,&quot;  said Lord  Milner,  &quot;is that the view of  every  section of  thecommunity should be adequately voiced in the Assembly.&quot;  It is not clear  to us whythe European  community should  require 11 members to voice its views, while two members are considered to be sufficient for the Indian community.     6. Further, where Indian interests  are  concerned, the official  majority does notappear always to be  a reliable safeguard.  Our attention has been called to the reportof the proceedings of the Legislative Council in the Nairobi Leader  of 10th July last.It is stated there that Lord Delamere, an elected  European member, moved an amend-ment to the  Income Tax Bill to the effect that English should be the only permissiblelanguage  for  book-keeping.   It  was objected  that  many Indian traders  would  be unable to keep books in English, and that small  outpost  traders would be  driven fromthe  country;   but  Lord  Delamere  insisted  that it  was an  English  colony.  HisExcellency the Governor  intervened in the debate, and  pointed out that the matter was one for the  home authorities to  decide.   Nevertheless, Lord De]a mere&apos;s amend-ment was carried, His Excellency voting in the minority.     7. We  are  convinced  that  the  only reliable safeguard  for Indian interests is adequate representation on the Legislative Council.   At  the same time, we desire  toreiterate our opinion that there should be a common electoral roll and a commonfranchise on  a  reasonable  property  basis plus an  educational  test, without  racial discrimination, for all British subjects.  We believe that this  is the true  solution ofthe East  African problem.   We fear that separate representation  for the differentcommunities will perpetuate and intensify racial antagonism.    On the other hand,  acommon electorate, whereby a member of one community would represent constituentsof another community, would tend to moderate  and compose racial differences.   Inno other  way, we believe, will the diverse races in East Africa  become  a  unitedpeople.     8. We  recognise that practical objections will be urged against such  a solution.In the first place, the Legislative Council Ordinance of 1919 conferred adult suffrage onthe European population ; and it may be admitted at once that the Indian community is not ripe for adult suffrage.  On the other hand; the adoption of a common franchiseon the basis  which we have suggested, would  mean a narrower  franchise for  theEuropean community than that which they now  enjoy.   It is not within our provinceto  question whether it  was wise at once to confer adult suffrage on  the shiftingEuropean population of a new  country  like Kenya Colony.   It  is probable, at  any&quot;rate, that the  great majority would satisfy the property and educational qualificationswhich we would suggest. We recognise that it  would not be possible to  disfranchiseanyone who already has the vote ;  but for the future we  would urge that there  should&quot;be a common  qualification for  everyone, of whatever race,  who  is admitted to  the
electoral roll.   The composition of the Legislative Council is admittedly experimental,and we would submit, with respect, that its revision should not be prejudiced  by  the ordinance of 1919, which was passed without consideration  of our views, and indeedwithout our knowledge.    9. Secondly,  it may be  objected  that  as  the  Indians  in East Africa are more numerous  than the Europeans and are  likely to increase  more rapidly, a commonelectorate  would mean that the Indian  members  would dominate the  LegislativeCouncil, and that this would be  incompatible with the responsibilities of the  BritishGovernment for the welfare of the Colony as a whole, and of the native population inparticular.  The objection is admittedly not immediate, for it is stated  in para. 3 ofthe Despatch of the 21st  May that there  is only a  very small  number of the Indiancommunity who can be regarded as qualified to  exercise the  franchise.  Hence, if  the qualification for a  common franchise is properly defined, it follows that the number ofIndian voters will be far less than the number  of European voters.   In the future itis true that with better educational  facilities and increased  wealth the Indian votersmight outnumber the European.   But the Indian voters would still, it is believed, toa  large extent  be  concentrated in  the urban constituencies.   The  country districtswould continue to return  European  members.   Finally, it is common  cause that  theinterests of the native population require that  the  official  majority  should remain.The fear of Indian  domination is, we submit, unfounded.     10.  In para. 4 of the Despatch of the 21st May, Lord Milner directs that the samearrangements should be made for the elective representation of Indians on MunicipalCouncils.  We  understand that the Nairobi Municipal Council, which  is the mostimportant in  the Colony, now consists  of one nominated official and 12  electedEuropeans, and that it is proposed to add three elected Indians.  We have no exactfigures to show the relative positions of the different communities, but we are informedthat the population and the incidence of municipal taxation are roughly as follows :                                                Population.  Municipal Taxation.                                                                KB.              Europeans   -         -         -   2,000         70,000              Indians  -                         5,000       1,20,000  -             Africans    -         -         -  12,000         10,000              Government grant       -      -               50,000     Here, again,  we  would  urge  most strongly  that Indian  interests should be adequately represented.  In the Municipal Councils there is not even the  safeguard-of an official majority.  And  it is believed that the  insanitary  conditions in whichIndians are frequently living are due, in part, at any rate, to the neglect of the municipal authorities.     11.  Here again also, we would press for a  common electoral  roll  and a commonfranchise.  The ward system of election would secure adequate representation , foreach  community;  and an increase in the number of  official members, which  theinterests  of the large native population would appear to require, would be  a  safe-guard against  the predominance of any single community.                               Segregation of  races.     12. In para.  7 of the Despatch  of the  21st  May, Lord Milner  has  directed that  the  principle of race segregation should  be adhered  to in the residential areasof townships and, whenever practicable,  in commercial areas also.  We noted with satisfaction Lord   Milner&apos;s assurance  to  Lord Islington&apos;s deputation  that  in  any decision  which, might be come to he would certainly  not  be  actuated  either byracial prejudice or allow considerations of trade  jealously  to prevail.   And weobserve  that  there   is no intention to  discriminate  against Indians, or to  sacrificeIndian to European interests.  It appears from Lord M.milner&apos;s speech in the House-of Lords  on the  14th  July  that  the  policy   of  race segregation  emanates  from Professor W.  J.  Simpson, whose  principles  are  enunciated in para.   (16)  of his:report  on Sanitary Matters in the East Africa Protectorate,  Uganda, and Zanzibar, as.follows :         &apos;; Lack of control over buildings, sbreets and lanes, and over the  general growth and development      of  towns and trade centres in East Africa and Uganda, combined with the  intermingling, in the      same quarters of town and trade centres,  of races with different  customs and habits, accounts for      many of the insanitary conditions in them and for the extension of disease from one race to      another.  It is necessary that this  haphazard method should be  ended and that town planning      schemes embodying separate  quarters for Europeans,  Asiatics  and  Africans, together with      regulations for and control of buildings, should be adopted. In forming such  schemes, it is requisite
       to bear in mind the differences which obtain between towns in East Africa and Uganda and  those-       of Europe.  In the latter, where the xace is practically  the same, town planning resolves  itself       into arranging for residential, commercial and manufacturing areas, which are further governed in       character by rental and class, and in such a way as to secure convenience, good transit, pleasing       amenities and healthiness for all. In the former, something more than this is required where the       races are diverse, and their habits  and customs different from one another.  Though the  same       objects have to be aimed at in both, it&apos;has to be recognised that the standard and mode of life of       the Asiatic do not ordinarily consort with the European,  whilst the customs of Europeans are at       times not acceptable to the Asiatics, and that those of the African unfamiliar with and not adapted       to the new conditions of town life will not blend with either.  Also that the diseases to which  these       different races are respectively liable are readily transferable to the European and vice versa, a result       specially liable to occur when their dwellings are near each other.         &quot; In the interests of each community, and of the healthiness of the locality and country, it is       absolutely essential that in every town and trade centre the town planning should provide well       defined and separate quarters or wards for Europeans, Asiatics and Africans, as well as those divi-       sions which are necessary in  a town  of one nationality and race, find that there should be a neutral       belt of open unoccupied country of at least 300  yards in width between the European  residences       and those of the Asiatic and African.  This neutral or protective zone definitely prevents European       houses approaching or encroaching on the Asiatic or African quarter and vice versa ; it is also a       useful open  space which can he used for recreation purposes by all races.&quot;      Professor Simpson&apos;s object  is  thus sanitary.   Lord Milner is also influenced by social reasons.  To quote again his  speech of the 14th July:         &quot;My own conviction is that in the interests of social comfort, social convenience and social       peace, the residence of different races in different areas I am speaking now of the populous city       areas is desirable,  and so far from stimulating it is calculated to mitigate hostility and       ill-feeling.&apos;&quot;     Nevertheless, Lord  Milner&apos;s decision is bitterly resented not only by Indians in East  Africa,  but  by  educated  opinion throughout  India.   The  reasons  for  this resentment require careful consideration.     13.  We  will  first consider segregation  in commercial areas.   The first objection is that it is  irrational.   If the end in view  is to prevent &quot; the intermingling, in  the same  quarters of town  and trade centres, of  races with different customs  and  habits,&quot; the  nationality of a business  firm  would appear  to  be  of  less importance than  the nationality of its employees and  customers.   It seems irrational, for  instance, that a European  and  an  Indian  firm, which are alike  dealing mainly  with  European customers  and  are alike employing Indian  clerks and  assistants, should be made to trade  in different quarters.   Or again, sanitation and  social convenience do not appear to require that  a European firm  with  a large native  retail trade should  carry on its business in the  European quarter.   The distinction would  break clown altogether in the case of companies.     Secondly, from the  strictly commercial point of view it  is inconvenient that firms doing the same  class of business  should be separated by an  artificial barrier.  In  the Uganda Protectorate, which is less affected by racial prejudice, the recently appointed Development  Commission,  in para.  209 of their  report, stated  that  they would be strongly  opposed  to any segregation in the business  areas.  And  we are  informed that the  Uganda  Chamber  of Commerce  has  expressed similar views.  Again, in Mombasa, the most important commercial town in East Africa, which is free from  the racial bitterness of the uplands, we  understand  that European  opinion  generally favours a joint business  area.     Thirdly,  it is feared that  the  condition of segregation  which Lord  Milner postulates, namely, that Indians should be fairly dealt with  in the selection  of sites, will not be fulfilled.  And it must  be  admitted that the  plans  of Nairobi,  Mombasa and Kisumu, facing pages 24, 45 and 59 of Professor Simpson&apos;s report, are sufficient cause for  anxiety.  In  Nairobi, Professor Simpson proposed  that the whole of  the present business quarter between the railway station and the river should be  reserved for  Europeans :  Indians were to be relegated to the  other  side of the river.  In Mombasa, again, the whole of  the area adjoining the harbour of Kilindini was to be the European business area : Indians were to be kept on the other side of the island. And in Kisumu, where practically the whole  of the  trade is  in the hands of Indians, one  short street was allotted for the Indian &quot; bazaar,&quot; wdiile an extensive block was to- &quot;be laid out as European business quarters.     Fourthly, it is  objected that segregation in commercial areas  is  impracticable.In Nairobi a considerable part of  the land which Professor Simpson had  included inthe European  commercial area, is already occupied by Indians, who, it is recognised,cannot .be expropriated.  We are   indebted  to  Sir  Edward  Northey  for  the planattached to this  Despatch, showing the lay-out  which is now proposed.  Comparisonwith the map facing  page 24  of   Professor Simpson&apos;s report  will  show  that  his.
 recommendations have been substantially modified.   We gratefully acknowledge the liberal spirit  in  which  Sir  Edward Northey  has interpreted Lord Milner&apos;s  orders. At the same  time, it is apparent that his proposals,  which are based  on practical considerations, are not consistent with Professor Simpson&apos;s theories.   The European and Asiatic areas are now separated only by the width of a street; and the  Indian bazaar, which, in  Professor Simpson&apos;s  opinion,, is  the centre  of infection, remains where it is, running out like a promontory into the European area.  Moreover, a large number of plots in the revised European  area, and more especially in the important Government  Road, are still  occupied by Indians, whom it is not intended to disturb. In fact, it would appear that commercial segregation  in Nairobi is now practically narrowed down  to the  question whether Indians shall be allowed  to bid for  certain unoccupied plots in the best business streets, in which Indians are already established, but which it is now desired to reserve for European  occupation.     14. If, then, the  object in view is sanitation and social convenience, we  submit that the criterion should be the class of business, and  not nationality.   We suggest that there should be a joint commercial area, regulated  by strict sanitary and building- laws, which  would ensure  that  only businesses of good class, whatever may be their nationality,  should be  established in the best streets,  and that businesses of inferior class, whatever may be their nationalty, should be confined to less  important streets. Further, it  has  frequently been noticed  that the  practice  of  &quot; living-in &quot; leads to insanitary habits and. overcrowding; and we would suggest that  &quot;living-in&quot;  should be prohibited, at  any rate in the best  streets.   In other words, to use the  phrase which,  we understand,  is current  in Nairobi, there should be  a joint &quot; lock-up &quot; commercial area.     15. We have  next  to consider the question of  segregation in  residential areas. It is admitted that the Indians in East Africa naturally  prefer to live together in their own quarter, and have no desire to live in  the  European residential  area.  They have only asked  that  they should  be  allowed to  acquire suitable residential  sites, which hitherto have  generally  been denied  to  them.  The  only  exceptions are the few Indians who  have been brought up to live in  European style; and it  is understood that the  Government  of  the Colony would  not  desire to enforce  the  policy  of segregation rigidly in such cases.    16. The Indian objection to residential segregation  is primarily  a question of principle.   It is  felt, not only by Indians in East Africa, but also throughout India, that compulsory segregation implies a racial stigma.  In theory, it may be that there is no question of racial  discrimination against Indians.  It  is unfortunate, however, that the policy of segregation as advocated by Europeans  in  East Africa  is animated by the racial feeling which marred the Economic Commission^ report.  And it is  not easy for Indians to appreciate that the reasons  for which  Lord  Milner has accepted this policy are wholly different.   Nor is  it a matter of mere sentiment.   They  fear that in practice the policy of segregation will be administered in a spirit  of racialism rather  than of even-handed justice.  In his speech of the 14th July, Lord. Milner  said that the condition on which he was  prepared to  defend segregation was that there should be fair treatment of both races in the matter of sites.   &quot; 1  mean to say,&quot; he added, &quot; that you should not give all the best sites to Europeans and cram the Indiansinto inferior localities.&quot;  This, however,  they consider, is precisely what has happened in the  past,  when the principle  of  segregation  was not formally recognised.  Andthey see no reason to expect that  the formal recognition of the principle will  bettertheir condition.    17. These fears do not  appear to us to be  groundless.  In the projected plans ofNairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in Professor Simpson&apos;s  report, the areas  demarcatedfor European and Asiatic  residence  respectively,  apart  from  any  question  of convenience,  are  wholly disproportionate  to the  numbers of the two communities.And it is understood that in the case of residential areas no  substantial modificationof  Professor  Simpson&apos;s  proposals  is intended.   It seems to  us, indeed,   almostinevitable  that compulsory segregation will mean that the  best sites will be allotted tothe race which is politically most powerful.   Further,  it. can  he taken as almost certain  that the  race  which  controls the Municipal Council  will  spend an  unfairproportion of the  revenue of the municipality on its own quarter, and will neglect theareas occupied by other races.  The practical effect of compidsory segregation on the race which is politically weaker can be seen in the Asiatic  ghettos in the Transvaal.     2745                                B
     18. We deeply regret that Lord Milner should  now have considered it advisable to  adopt the principle of race-segregation.  It seems to us to be a reversal of the principle for which His Majesty&apos;s Government have always contended in the  parallel case of  South Africa.   We  may perhaps be  permitted  to quote the words in which the late  Mr. Alfred Lyttelton, in his  Despatch dated the  20th July  1.901,  rejected the proposals which the Governor of the Transvaal had submitted for the segregation of Indians in the Transvaal:          &quot; His &apos;Majesty&apos;s Government hold  that it is derogatory to the national honour to  impose on      resident British subjects disabilities against which we had remonstrated, and to which even the      law of the late South African Republic rightly interpreted did not subject them, and they do not      doubt that when this is perceived the public opinion of the Colony will not any longer support tho      demand which has been put forward.&quot;     We  believe that sanitation and  social convenience could be adequately secured by mutual consent, by strict enforcement of sanitary and building laws, and by a just administration  of  municipal revenues.   In  this way the end  which Lord Milner has in  view, to promote social  comfort, social  convenience and  social  peace, might be attained. But legislation on racial lines, so far from mitigating, will stimulate  hostility and ill-feeling.  It will, we fear, gratuitously  provoke a conflict which  may  have grave political consequences in this country and throughout the Empire.                         Restrictions on Ownership of Land.     19. We will consider first the restriction on the  ownership of land in townships. In para. 8 of the Despatch of the 21st May, Lord Milner says that it seems necessarily to follow from the adoption of the  principle  of race-segregation that as a general rule no transfer  of land either  by way  of  ownership or mortgage  between Europeans and Asiatics should  be  allowed;  and similarly, when township plots are put up to  auction, Europeans should  not be allowed to bid for plots in  the Asiatic quarter or  Asiatics to bid for plots in the European quarter.     20.  Even  if the  principle  of race-segregation is admitted, the necessity of  this consequence does not seem  to us to be obvious.  Professor Simpson himself, at the end of para,  (16) of his report, says:        &quot; The town planning and division into  separate zones and reservations would not prevent any     European, Asiatic or  African owning land, or buildings in any zone, except the neutral  zone,     provided they conform to the provisions of the Ordinance relating to these zonfis.&quot;    We would also invite attention to para. 212 of the report of the Uganda Develop-ment Commission :        &quot; We have said that we advocate segregation  in residential areas, but we consider that a person     should  be able  to acquire  land in any area in a township, even though he may not be able  to     occupy it himself.  Any restriction on acquisition would prevent a plot holder from obtaining the     full market price for his land and we do not think that this is justifiable or necessary.&quot;    It may  be added that  the restriction  would close a legitimate field for investmentboth to  Indians and to Europeans, and in the  case  of sales of new plots would belikely to prevent the State also from obtaining the full  market price for Crown lands.It is understood that Indians already own many  plots  in the  areas  now  occupied by Europeans,  and vice versa.   It would  appear to us to be inequitable to restrict the right of  transfer of  plots  already  alienated,&apos; and  unnecessary  to impose any such restriction in the sale of new plots which  may be alienated hereafter.     21.  There  remains the  restriction on the acquisition by  Indians of agricultural land in  the  uplands..  It  is  suggested in para. 6 of the Despatch  of the 21st  May that this merely re-affirms  Lord  Elgin&apos;s decision, contained  in his Despatch of the 19th March 1908, that as a matter of  administrative convenience grants of land in the upland area should not  be made to Indians.  We understand, however, that practically no land which is now capable of development, remains to be alienated in the  uplands. In  the course  of  his address  to  the Convention of Associations  at Nairobi on the 9th August last, His  Excellency the  Governor is reported, in  the  East  African Standard of the 14th August, to have said:         &quot; By the time this whole settlement scheme (the Soldier Settlement scheme) had been readjusted,      i.e., that farms Avhich had not turned out to be  what it Avas hoped they would be were replaced by      something better, there should not be  a farm left worth having.&quot;     It would thus appear that  there is  now practically  no  land  left to which Lord Elgin&apos;s decision could be applied.  It is  understood, however, that the restriction has now been extended so  as to  prohibit  the transfer  of land  to Indians.   We  would point out that this goes far  beyond Lord Elgin&apos;s decision, and is incompatible  with his own  pronouncement that  it is  not  consonant with the  views of His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose legal restrictions on any particular section of the community in regard to the acquisition  of land.
     22,  Lord Milner has justified  the exclusion of Indians  from the uplands on theground that Europeans are by nature physically excluded  from  other areas.   Henceif the limited area which is suitable for European settlement were thrown open to thecompetition  of  Asiatics,  there would be, taking the  Colony as  a whole, a virtualdiscrimination  in  favour of  Asiatic as  against  European  settlement,  lie  cannot,therefore,  regard  the Indian claim  to   be  admitted to  the  uplands as  just  orreasonable.     23.  It has been argued with force that there are vast areas in the Empire suitablefor European settlement  from which Indians  are  excluded  either  by law or climate conditions, and  that it is, therefore,  unjust that Indians should  be prohibited fromacquiring  agricultural land in  a  colony which has  been, to a  considerable, extent,developed  by Indian  enterprise.  Apart  from this, however, it is not clear that the admission  of Indians to the uplands  would  be a  virtual discrimination  againstEuropeans.  First, it is necessary to determine what exactly is meant by the &quot; uplands.&quot;This term  is defined in the Despatch of  the  17th July 1906, in  which  the colonial secretary approved of the principle &quot; that the land  outside  municipal limits roughlylying  between  Kiu and Fort  Ternan should be  granted only to European settlers.&quot;It might be inferred  from the Despatch of  the  21st May and  from  Lord Milner&apos;flspeech of the 14th July that the  European settlers were confined to a comparatively small  area, while Indians enjoyed a monopoly elsewhere.   But reference to the  mapappended to this Despatch, for which we are  again indebted to Sir Edward Northey,will show that by far the larger part  of the area coloured red, which is alienated landor land surveyed for alienation,  lies between  Kiu and Fort  Ternan.  Further, almost the  whole of the alienated land  outside  these limits, that is in the lowlands, whichex hypotliesi are unsuitable for European  settlement, has been alienated to Europeans.The total area alienated to Europeans or available for alienation is given as 11,859 square miles.  The total area held by  Indians, we are informed, is only 32 square miles, outof which 21 square  miles have  been purchased from Europeans  and  only 11 square miles  have been  obtained from the Government.   In  addition, Indians hold a smallarea of agricultural land in the coastal belt; but here again, we understand, Europeansown large  plantations.     24. The  attitude  of the Government towards  the  acquisition  by  Indians ofagricultural land, even in the  lowlands, can be judged from the following case, whichhas been brought to our notice.     On the 11th February 1918  an estate, area  35 square  miles, situated at Voi inthe  lowlands, lying about .150  miles east of Kiu, the eastern boundary  of the uplands,which belonged to  the Deutsche  Englische  Ost-Africa Kompagnie Gesellschaft, anenemy firm, was  sold by  the Liquidator, together  with the  machinery standingthereon, to  Mr. William;  Stirling  of Nairobi for Rs. 1,700.  By an agreement datedthe  22nd June 1918, Mr. Stirling agreed  to sell an area of 10,000 acres, being part ofthis estate,  to  Messrs. Jiwa  Walji  and  Habib Nanji, British  Indian subjects,  forRs.  82,500.  The Honourable the  Land Officer, however, refused to sanction transfer.At an interview with Mr. Allen of  the firm of Messrs. Allen and  Hamilton, Solicitorsfor  Messrs.  Jiwa Walji  and  Habib  Nanji, on the 13th  September 1918, the LandOfficer was unable to suggest  any  reason  why consent to  transfer had been  refused,beyond the fact that it had not been the practice of the Government to grant farms toAsiatics exceeding  100  acres in  area.    This  was confirmed  in  a letter  dated the.14th September 1918, addressed by  Messrs. Allen and Hamilton to the  Land Officer,which continued as follows :         &quot; The concession which it  is  desired to  transfer from Mr. Stirling to our clients is situate at      Voi, a part of  the Protectorate which  it has never been suggested should be retained exclusively      for exploitation by Europeans.        &quot; It is the inherent right of a British subject such as Mr. Stirling is, to sell his property to the      best advantage and to  anyone whom  he pleases, and it is  the inherent right of our clients as      British subjects to purchase any property they think fit, provided only, in the case  of land, that      the proposed transaction does not infringe any law or regulation in force at the time.        &quot; We are aware that transfer requires the consent of Government, but such consent should not      and may not be arbitrarily withheld to the prejudice of individuals.        &quot; Our clients have two or three other Indians associated with them in the proposed purchase,      and they have undertaken to  pay Mr.  Stirling Rs. 82,500 purchase money, so  it is  obvious that      they are substantial persons.        &quot; We would ask you to be  good enough to have the application for transfer referred back to      His Excellency in Council with  the request that  the matter may be reconsidered in the light of      the faots set forth in this letter. If the refusal of consent cannot be withdrawn, we request that      we may be informed as soon as possible of the exact reasons for the refusal.&quot;      2745                                C
    In his letter No. 730.4 II L.A. J., dated the 17th October 1918, the Land  Officerreplied to Messrs.  Allen and Hamilton as follows :        &quot; In reply to your letter No. 478-3 of the 14th instant, I beg to inform you that His Excellency      has given the matter long and careful consideration, but does not consider the present an opportune      time to introduce such an important innovation in the land  policy of the  Protectorate as would      be constituted by the registration of this proposed transfer, to which therefore His Excellency      regrets that he is unable to consent.&quot;    We submit  that it is not easy to reconcile the land policy of the East african government  with Lord Milner&apos;s  assurance that &quot;it  has  been the  avowed principle,&quot; and it is the  definite  intention, of  the British authorities to mete out even-handed&quot; justice between  the different races inhabiting those territories.&quot;    25.  In the circumstances which we have set  forth, we are unable to  agree thatthe Indian claim to be allowed  to acquire agricultural land anywhere in the Colony is neither just  nor reasonable.  We do not consider  that the proposal in the latter partof para, b&apos; of  the  Despatch of the 21st May is adequate compensation for the exclusion of Indians from the uplands.  And we hold most strongly that there is no justification for the extension  of Lord Elgin&apos;s  decision so as  to prohibit the transfer of land to indians, which, in  our  view,  is incompatible with his own  pronouncement.   Wewould add that it is the opinion of Sir Benjamin Robertson  that climatic disabilitiesin the Colony as a whole tend  to operate against the Indian rather than against theEuropean settler.  The  European, who works on the plantation system with native-labour,  can  and   does cultivate the lowlands.  The European planter is no moreexcluded by  climatic considerations from the lowlands than  he is excluded from othertropical  countries. - On  the other hand,  it is doubtful  whether  the Indian  farmerwould prosper  in  the cold climate  of the uplands.  We understand that this opinion is supported  by experience in Natal.  The acquisition of  agricultural land by indians in Natal is not restricted.   There are many wealthy Indians, and there are more than100,000  Indians  of  the  agricultural class.   There is a keen demand  for land in thecoast  belt, which  has not been  satisfied.   But, very few farms have been acquired  by indians  in the uplands; and  the  evidence before the recent Commission was that where Indians have attempted  to farm in the uplands, they have generally failed.  Ifthen,  as Lord  Milner  suggests,  the issue in  Kenya Colony is  merely  a  question ofclimate, we would urge that it be left for the climate to decide.    26.  The  Despatch of  the 21st May purports  to  deal  only  with the various questions affecting the Indian  community in  British East Africa.   We are informed,however, by  Sir  Benjamin Robertson that under the orders of the Colonial office lord  Milner&apos;s decisions were announced simultaneously in Nairobi  and Entebbe, andare understood to  apply mutatis mutandis to  the Uganda Protectorate.  We were not previously aware  that the  position of the Indians  in  Uganda was even under theconsideration of  the Colonial Office.  Here again, we must  protest most strongly thatwe  were  not  given  a  proper opportunity to  represent  our  views.   Moreover,from  the information before us it would appear that the East African decisions aregenerally inapplicable to conditions in Uganda.    27.  In the first place, we understand that  in Uganda  there is no  LegislativeCouncil1 nor any  elected Municipal  Council.   On  the  contrary,  in the importantBuganda Province the native Lukiko already enjoys a  substantial measure of autonomy,and it is likely that similar forms of native government will eventually be  established in the other Provinces.    Secondly, as  has already been stated, the Uganda Development  Commission, in para.  209 of  their report, have  rejected the principle of segregation in business areas as impracticable.    Thirdly, the  Development  Commission  in  the same paragraph  of their report,which was signed by two Asiatic members,  accepted  generally the principle of separate residential areas for different races;  and  it  would appear that if no orders had been issued, this question  would have been settled amicably by mutual consent.    Fourthly,  as  already  stated, the Development Commission  in para. 212 of  theirreport have rejected restrictions  on the  acquisition of land  in  townships as  neitherjustifiable nor necessary.    Finally,  there are no &quot; uplands &quot; in Uganda.    28. In short, the racial issue would seem to have been raised  unnecessarily in uganda.   We  are informed by Sir Benjamin Robertson  that  the relations  of theIndian  community in Uganda  with  the Government and  with unofficial Europeans    1 [It is now proposed to establish such a Council, consisting of the  Governor, certain ex-officiomembers, and official  and non-official nominated members. India Office,  16th November 1920.]
have always been cordial; and this is borne out by the friendly spirit  of  the  reportof the Development Commission, on which all classes  were represented.   We may,perhaps, be permitted  to quote para.  43 of their  report, in contrast  to  the racialbitterness which animated the report of the East Africa  Economic Commission :        &quot; The country owes much to the Indian trader and we consider that a broad policy of toleration      should be adopted  towards him.  He has shown, jjnergy and enterprise, and has assisted in the      opening up of the more remote districts.  He is also of value as an agriculturist and  his activities      in this direction might well be encouraged.&quot;    It seems  to us regrettable  that Uganda should have been  drawn  into the east african  controversy.   As  things  now  stand,  the Indians  in Uganda   fear thatdisabilities to  which they have not hitherto been subjected, will now  be imposed upon them.   It will relieve anxiety if they are  assured as early as possible that this is notthe intention, of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    29.  To conclude, we are unable to  accept Lord  Milners decisions  as a final settlement.  It is  our duty to impress on you that public opinion  throughout Indiaregards the case of the Indians in East Africa as a test  of the  position of India in  theBritish Empire.   At  the Imperial Conference of 1918, for the sake of Imperial unitywe accepted  the reciprocity resolution, which practically excludes  Indians from :the self-governing dominions.   We  cannot agree  to inequality of treatment in a Crowncolony, more especially  in a colony in  which India has  always had a peculiar interest.We have shown in this  Despatch that, whatever  may be the intention of Lord Milner&apos;decisions, there is  in practice an unfair discrimination against  Indians in East Africa.If further  proof is needed, we  may  point to the fact  that in Tanganyika territory,where Indians are protected by the Covenant of  the League of rNations, Lord Milner&apos;decisions cannot be applied.  It seems to us  to be an impossible position that. BritishIndians in a British Colony should be  subjected to disabilities to which they cannotbe subjected in an adjoining mandated territory.     30.  It  has been suggested that a Royal  Commission  should  be appointed toconsider the whole question of the administration of the East  African territories ;  andit appears from  his  reply  to  Lord  Islington&apos;s deputation  on  the 19th  April that lord  Milner himself is not averse to the proposal.   We would urge  the appointmentof  such a Commission and the  inclusion  of the  Indian question in the terms ofreference.  In no  other way, we believe, will it  be  possible to assemble the facts onwhich a just decision can be  based.   We would also urge that the Government ofIndia should  be represented on the Commission.   We cannot admit that  we are not directly concerned.   To quote  once more Lord Milners reply to  Lord  Islington&apos;sdeputation, *&apos; we will cease to be an Empire if any portion of the Empire  is entirelyrelieved from responsibility for  what happens in another.&quot;  The Government of Indiacannot and will not disclaim responsibility  for the welfare of  the Indians who are settled in East Africa.
