       1.   The movement towr^ds union of the two great Scottish Churches - the Church of Scotland and  theUnited Free  Church of Scotland - has in recent times increased in volume and in strength.   Both Churches are now pressingme, as representing the Government,  for the Introduction or aBill to-render that union possible^   A draft Bill has beenprepared by the Church authorities and is scheduled to thismemorandum^         2*   One ofthe principal leaders of tho movementin tho Churoh of Scotland ID Lord Balfour of Burleigh. whohas boon in frequent communication with tho Prime Minister,the Lord Privy Seal, and myself, upon the subject.    There canbe no doubt that his influence with  regard to a Scottishquestion would he vory great In tho  House of Lords.    He is,however, of opinion - and I agree with him - that the Billshould be introduced in the House of Commons rather than inthe House of Lords *          3*   As regards the House  of Commons) fortyScottish iieittbers, and a number of Scotsmen who representEnglish constituencies, have signed  a memorial to the primeMinister, requesting that the Goyornnent should introduce,at as early a date as po s s lb ie, a me a sure r c c ogjiis ing&quot;&quot;*fchdapproved articles, prepared by the Church of Scotland and agreed to by the United Freo Church, as a possible basis  .of union.   Seven Scottish ; embers who have not signed the memorial will not oppose It.   One is abroad, and twelve are members of the Governments   There remain fourteen ScottishMembers who, owing either to absence or somo other reason,have not been asked to sign the memorials          4*   As regards the Churches themselves., while there is no doubt a minority in each which is opposed tounion, nevertheless, the reports by  the committees of therespective Churches In favour of union were approved  by over-whelming majosdt^os in the Assembly of the Church of  Scotlandand in the Assembly of tho United Free Church this year.Both Assemblies are in favour of legislation noon tho lineaproposed in the draft Bill.           5*   As regards fooling In Scotland outside the churches, so far as I am able to judge, it Is overwhelminglyin favour of union *   Tho sane sentiment has found frequentand forcible expression in England during recent months,          6*   Tho practical question for decision is whethertho measure to be introduced should be a Government measureor should he introduced upon the responsibility of a  private member., I am clearly of opinion that the former course should be adopted*   There will be bitter disappointmentthroughout both dhurches and throughout Scotland generally   the Government were merely to offer facilities to  a orivatomember to introduce a measure -of such national interest and importance.   The matter is urgent,  and I ask for the favourof an early decision.Scottish Office-,  25th November, 1920*ROBIVRT JftJHRO..&apos; falllS DOOUJtfJT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS DRITAHNXO majesty*S Government!.ffiNT)OOHP IDE l^IAL                                                     ^ &apos;^                               BINET.CP.2172,((1                   PROPOSED CHURCH Qg SCOTUMP B3XLte                 HBHOIiANDmi BY .TKE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.
