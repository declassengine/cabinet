The bad feeling existing between the Czechs and theGermans came to a head at Toplitz and various other townswhere serious disturbances occurred.                    SOUTH  RUSSIA.,         Ukraine.     The Bolsheviks are attacking Petlura,and the lihe now held by the Ukrainians is East and Southof Proskurov and thence Y/est to Sbrucznahusiatyn.

GREECE.         Contrary to all expectations, the Greek elections have resulted in an overwhelming defeat for Venizclos.  The latterhas resigned and M*Riallis has formed a ministry.  After takingthe oath before the Regent, Admiral Coundouriotis, the newPresident of the Council called upon Coundouriotis to resign,and dueen Olga, Constantine&apos;s mother, has been proclaimedRegent.        Venizelos1 dovmfall is attributed largely to the inability of the country to tolerate any longer the strain involved by thoprotracted mobilisation (the Greek army has been mobilised con-tinuously since the outbreak of the first Balkan war in 1912).M. Venizelos  long absence from Greece, necessitated by theprotracted peace treaty negotiations, during which period theinternal  government of the country appears to have been veryindifferently administered, and the complete confidence o&quot; his party in the result of the elections v/nich led to an entireneglect of tho political campaign, are also largely accountablefor the disaster.         M. Venizelos, after an interview with M.Riallis, duringwhich he urgently appealed to the  latter to advise Constantinoto vdthdraw in favour of the crown Prince, sailed from thePiraeus  on &quot;Wednesday 17th November.         The whole country has turned enthusiastically Constan-tinist and it is  gsnerally accepted that the plebiscite on thequestion of the succession, which is to be held  on Sunday 28thNovember j. will show an almost unanimous vote in  favour of tielatter&apos;s return.         The new Government have expressed their intention of continuing MtVenizelos1 foreign policy, but since the vote seemsH;o have turned largely on the question of demobilisation thepossibility of a reduction o.f the  Greek forces in the occupied territories has been discussed.         Gere ral Harrington, the new Allied C-in^-C atConstantinople reports that the Greek Manissa division which isunder his orders in the Ismid district has announced its unswerv-ing loyalty to the Allies, and that there are so far no  signs  ofany loss of moral on the part of the  Greek troops in the  Smyrna   ca.          General Paraskevopoulos has  been relieved  of his  command.         Admiral  Kelly, the head  of  the  British  Naval Ms si on toGroooe has had an interview with M.Riallis. who  received him withgreat  politeness  and requested him to continue his  good  work.  -
