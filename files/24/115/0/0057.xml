(2)  THP  CONDITION  OP AUSTRIAi        &quot;  .                                                  i           The following note of  a  conversation between the Chancellor      af  the Exchequer,  sir Hugh  Leviok and sir William Goode is                   circulated for information.                            ........           The Chancellor saw sir Hugh Levick yesterday.  He gave      instructions for a letter formally appointing Sir John Bradbury      as  His lajesty^s Government&apos;a Representative  fir the forthcoming      Brussels conference.  sir Hugh  Levick raised  the question of the      chairmanship.   The chancellor thought it was undesirable in      view of our position vis-a-vis  the prench that the British      Representative shluld be  in the chair and thought the suggestion      that the Belgian Representative, Colonel Theunis, should be      Chairman,  would be the  right  solution.  Sir Hugh,Levick raised      the question of the resumption of social relations with Dr.      Bergman,  possibly the  beat procedure w:uld be for Colonel      Theunis to give a dinner  to all the delegates including the      German at Brussels.  If Colonel Theunis thought of giving such      a dinner it would be well that  he should find out in advance      whether the French wciila  attend.  The Chancellor said he      would see Lord curzon and the prime Minister  as to this.           Sir Hugh xe^ick wanted to  make sure that the Chanoellor      understood that it &apos;Would  be impossible for  the Reparation      Commission to put in any  claim before Kay 1st, 1921 which could      not be criticised by the  Germans.  The chancellor said he      appreciated this,  but he  though it was desirable for Sir John      Bradbury to make a statement  to this  effect in his Report to      the Brussels conference,  sir Hu$i Levick raised the question                               - 1 -
of &apos;instructions * .  The Chancellor pointed out that thNy must &quot; &quot; &quot;follow the. terms of the Agreement.  The French mivht press  forterms of reference but, as far as we are concerned,  it was  better to do without them.     Si r tTu $h z e vi c k ref err e d t o the Repar at i one ommi 3 si on&apos; Bresolution as regards Austria.  The Chancellor pointed outthat if it was competent to the Reparation commission to declare that Austria could not pay reparation it must be equally within their competence to declare how much germany could pay.  This might be useful for Sir John Bradbury.     The general question of the position of Austria was thendiscussed and sir William Goode introduced.  The ChancellorreFXd out Mr. 131.ackett&apos; s Minute which he said expressed his views,  sir William Goode explained.that the real question was the trouble which mi^ht be expected in the adjoiningcountries.  Nothing but cosh assistance would prevent dissolution-tion.  With suoh assistance he thought that in ten or fifteen years Austria might be self-supporting and be able to payinterest. . The surrender of all charges on Austrian assetswould not meet the situation.     The Chancellor decided that the documents should be printedand circulated to the cabinet.  He was prepared to allot thewhole of the remaining  1,100/000 of the  10,000; 000 ReliefVote to Austria, but there would be a question whether partcf it ought not to go to Poland,     The Chancellor authorised Sir William Goode to place himself in communication with the Foreign office and the WarOffice and to supply them with any information that they desired.          Copies will be circulated in due course, as          C.P. 2139.\teasury chambers,  24th November,  19So.
