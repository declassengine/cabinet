ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BILL.             3            Memorandum for tho Cabinet by the  Minister of Transport.                The opposition which has manifested  itself in the      House to the Electricity Supply Bill has  induced me to  reconsider      the whole position in conjunction with  the Electricity      Commissioners, more particularly as we  have now had some      experience of the working of the Act of 1919.                It will be remembered that the  Bill  for the original      Act evoked considerable opposition In the House of lords uponj-            (a)  the proposal to vest compulsorily In the new                bodies to be constituted under  the Act all                generating stations and plant in their areasJ  and            (b)  the power to the Electricity Commissioners to Issue                electricity stook to the amount of  25,000,000                carrying a Treasury guarantee of interest.                On the consideration of the lords  amendments to  the      Bill for the Act of 1919 the House was  Informed that the      proposals which had been struck out of the Bill in the  House of      Lords would be put forward again with a view to their passage      pro forma through the House for resubmission to the House of      Lords and the Bill now before the House was accordingly      Introduced on 13th April,                Since then it has become quite  clear that the Bill must      be regarded as highly controversial and its passage in the      limited time available this Session will  be impossible.                I believe that the controversy mainly centres on  the      provision for vesting compulsorily in the new  bodies all tho                                                          existing/
existing undertakings In the areas for which they are to be constituted^          It will also be in the recollection of my colleagues that objection on financial grounds was taken to the inclusionof the provision relating to the Issue of an electricity stockwith the Treasury guarantee.   Moreover this provision willprovoke opposition in the House of Lords.          I have therefore prepared a new Bill to confer those powers contained in the existing Bill which I have reason tothink will be non-controversial, and certain other powers whichexperience has shewn to be necessary none of which are in myopinion likely to raise any serious controversy.          A more general tendency among the owners of electricity undertakings to put forward schemes on an agreed basis has beenmanifested than I had anticipated and much progress has beenmade towards arriving by mutual understanding and agreement atthe objects with which the Act of 1919 was passed.          The existence however of tho compulsory provisions  inthe Bill now before the House and the lack.of the powers which  I now propose are producing a disruptive effect in some of theoases where agreement would otherwise be arrived at and is seriously impeding the further progress with the schemes nowIn course of preparation.          While I propose to withdraw the compulsory powerscontained in the present Bill I desire to make it clear that  inmy opinion the time will soon come whofc there will be a residuumof areas for which it will not be possible by mutual agreement among those concerned, to constitute satisfactory bodies to administer the- supply of electricity.                                                       I am/
          I am also of opinion that there will be cases  inwhich joint electricity authorities will not be able to  raisofor themselves at a sufficiently cheap rate the money requiredto give an effective supply of eloctrioity within their  areas,          I therefore wish to reserve for the future considera-tlon of my colleagues further legislative proposals to compel the constitution of Joint electricity authorities in areas where agreement cannot be attained and to provide financialassistance in appropriate cases by means of a stock to beissued by the Electricity Commissioners under a Treasuryguarantee of Interest or by such method of state aid as  the then conditions may indicate*          I have attached to this memorandum a detailed  note of the powers proposed by the Bill now before the Houseindicating those which I suggest for retention and those whichI propose for omission together with a. note of the new proposalI make.          I ask leave to withdraw the present Bill and tointroduce as a matter of urgency for passage this session thenew Bill submitted with this memorandum.10th November,  1920.(Signed)  Eric  Geddes.
NEW POWERS.Tho new powers proposed are as follows.-Clause^, provides machinery for the postponement in proper casesof annual payments to Sinking Fund which a Joint electricity authority would otherwise be required to make until the worksupon which the monoy has been expended are brought intoremunerative operation.Clause  .amends Section 29 of the Act ef 1919 with respectto the provision to be made for the expenses of the Commisslonereduring the earlier years.   It extends by arrangement with theTreasury the period for repayment of moneys advanced by theTreasury for payment of these expenses- and provides mere detail&amp;iand effective machinery for the levying and c^JlIe^riian from t&amp;e  .ele-ctrioity industry of the annualexpenses of the O^iimls^doners-which by the Act of 1919, are made payable by that industry.Clause 10 applies the power which Is conferred by Section 22of the Act of 1919 for the acquisition of wayleaves for carryirgtransmission lines overhead so as to enable the continuanceof lines which are now carried overhead under arrangements with land-owners concerned.   The existing provision applies only to new lines and there are many lines in situ which it Is desiredto maintain permanently.   The Act of 1919 contains the necessary provision for appeals and settlement of terms.Clause ,14 proposes the reduction of the period within whichthe maximum prices chargeable for electricity can be rovisedfrom five years, as now fixed by the Electric Lighting Acts, to three years and extonds the power, which is at present applicableonly to Companies, to Local Authorities who have electric lighting undertakings.
Clause 15 is designed to simplify the procedure as t.$local inquiries which is laid down in the Act of 1919.   under that Act it is necessary for the Commissioners to holdthree local inquiries before finally deciding upon a scheme.     It is proposed to make this procedure more elastic and enable the Commissioners to hold one local inquiry at whichall the subject matters connected with the scheme can beconsidered together.   As the Act of 1919 is. framed theCommissioners have to hold an inquiry first as regards thearea to be included in an electricity district, and, havingdecided the district, to hold another inquiry as to thenecessity for improving the existing organisation in theDistrict and finally to hold an inquiry on any scheme thatmay be submitted for that district.   It win save time and make for efficiency if the area to be included in a district and the necessity for a scheme for the supply of that districtJLXTQ considered together at one inquiry.Clause 16 extends the provisions of Section 18 of the act of 1919.   Under that Act the Minister may construct generating stations and transmission lines.   It is now proposed that heshould have a power to purchase appropriate stations and lines.Clause 17 enables supply to be given from Railway orTramway Generating Stations either in bulk to&apos;authoriseddistributors or direct to consumers subject to approval by the Electricity Commissioners and to the condition thatit is not competitive supply.          The remaining Clauses are of a formal or incidentalcharacter.
