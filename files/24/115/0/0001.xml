Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.T.This Document is the  fProperty of refugees  in Mesopotamia.Isssaly  colleagues  will have noticed  that the information contained in the memo-randum circulated by the Secretary of State for War on the 9fch November (CP. 2082)is, in some  respects, supplemented  by that  contained in  my memorandum of  the4th November (CP. 2073).     It may not  be  out  of  place  to  remind the Cabinet  that the harbouring and disposal  of  these refugees  were nothing less than a debt of honour which it wasimpossible for  His  Majesty&apos;s Government to repudiate.   The actual operation  of repatriation was undertaken  by the  Civil Authorities  in  Mesopotamia as a matter of convenience.  I do not think  it can be  implied  that  my department, or any depart-ment,  has been  lagging behind  the  instructions of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  incarrying  out repatriation.  As  a  matter of fact, Sir Arnold Wilson only succeeded in bringing the  process to the stage  which it has now  reached by  anticipatinginstructions before His  Majesty&apos;s Government had finally decided  what instructionsto send.     As regards &quot; the indefinite continuance of heavy expenditure,&quot; I would pointout  that  one  of  the main  reasons which is now hindering  the  repatriation  ofArmenians to Erivan has  been the capitulation of Armenia to the Turks; and thatthat capitulation  was in part, at  any rate, due to delay (for which  my department was not responsible) in sending  munitions to the Armenian Government.16th November 1920.E.
