416ofi               THE  SHREK  POSITION.                  (Note., &quot;by x,ord Curzon.Ju      The decision as  to  the  policy  to be adopted in the event of  the  ex-King Constantine being recalled &quot;by ^ the Greek people to  the  throne  of Greece, depends to some eatent on our estimate of  the  chanoos  of his  desistence, Bhould the Powers die- couragg cr  oppose the act.  M* V*eni3el.0B think3 that in such a case  he would not dare to  act in opposition to the Allies,. and would abandon/candidature for the throne.  But M. Venezelos is  influenced  in this opinion &quot;by his desire to get Prince George  as King; and the  view taken by the French Ministers yesterday afternoon was  that, whatever the powers might decide to  do,  the  Greek plebiscite would end in an invitation to Cinstaxitine, and that he could accept it, it is upon this hypothesis  that this paper is written.     M* Leygues suggested five possible methods of dealing with  the  situation thus  created. (1)  That the Great Powers (we cannot a peak for the moment of Italy)  or alternatively the Guaranteeing powers, should decline to   .recof3nise him as King.  This is not likely of itself to be  a very effective weapon, for a country can get on very well  for  sometime without recognition; and the ban is one which in  practice cannot be indefinitely maintained. (2)  That the Powers Bhould break off diplomatic relations with Greece or  replace their Ministers by Charges d&apos;Affaires. This again  is not a very effective form ef punishment, for Greece *nd$it-say that she could get on perfeotly with a representative of inferior diplomatic rank,  and meanwhile a German Minister would appear upon the scene,  and might very likely become master of the Situation. (3)   That all financial support should be withdrawn from orrefused to Greece.
417     There aro, it appears two pri&amp;aipal forms in which fi$mm&amp;Lpressure mi^ht be applied.   The International FinancialCommission might veto the issue of fiduciary currencythe National Baa: of Greece.   Tho British Government had recently imposed such a veto on a lar^e paper issue whichthe Government of LI.  Venizelos desired to float but had withdrawn it on the rjorsonal intervention of IvI. Venizelos.On the other hand the French Government who had started by giving their consent have since withdrawn it.  - The two &apos;Governments by maintaining a joint veto might seriouslyembarrass the Greek Government..     The second respect in which action ni-ght be possiblewould be in connection with the Anglo-j?ranco-GreaJ  financial agreement of 1918, under which a book credit of  10,000,000  .in  &quot;London, and the franc equivalent of another  10,000,000in Paris were given to the Gr.ee it. Government.   The latterhave drawn about  6,500,000. on the British half of this credit.The F-ench half is believed to be still intact.    , It might be possible to argue that this Agreement, whichwas made with iM. Venisolos1 Government is no longer validwith a letter Government that is diametrically  opposed to  itspredeoessor.  It would however be unusual to adopt such acourso.  Its immediate effect  would  be&apos; a collapse  of  thedrachma exchange.  The ultimate effect would be  that  the greeks would have  no credit for purchase abroad.
(4)   That the Powers sLoukT decline t.o leave the&apos; Greeks ontho northern side of the Straits, on the ground that the               belatter could not/safely entrusted bo an enemy State.  Itwas suggested that the Military Control of the ^traits mightbe vested in the Straits Oommission and that the expensesoould be found out of Turkish   funds by the financial  Commissionsitting at Constantinople.     This proposal would appear to have been made in iorgetfulnessof the terms of the Turkish Treaty.   The Straits Commissioncomposed of representatives of the interested Maritime  Powershas nothing to do with the Military Protection or controlof the Straits.  It is concerned with such matters as  Channels,Harbours and Anchorages, pilotage, lighterage and so on.  inother words with freedom of navigation in the narrow andtechnical sense of the term*     The Greeks aro not at the present moment,  nor if  theTreaty is oarried out, are they capable of becoming the Mastersof the Straits.   When the Treaty has been ratified all  fortsand batteries in tho Gallipoli Peninsula and  the northern shore of the Marmora will be destroyed, the only troops will beAllied troops under the Allied Commander-in-Chief atConstantinople and the only other forces permitted will  beTurkish  or  Greeks Gendarmerie,  under the command and  thereforeas regards numbers,  under the  control of the  same officer.     In these circumstances it is not understood how it  ispossible ftr the Greeks, either now  or in the future tobecome a menace to the Allied. Powers or to control the entranceof the straits.  So lon^ as there are Allied, forces atConstantinople this is impossible.  If , however,  the  allied forces were withdrawn the Treaty would then have been  brokenby its own authors and a new situation would  arise.
419 (5)    (Either in conjunction -with- 6r-asHan..alterrjative to (4).)  -That Smyrna should not be given, as provided for in the Treaty, to the Greeks.     The practical difficulties in the way of executing this threat are oonsidorable.   Tho Greek Army is alroady  in occupation cf tho town and district,  the Greeks aro already administering the town, their administration is said  to be incomparably superior to that of the Turks,  and&apos;unless thoy retire voluntary from the place,  there is no one (except possibly Mustapha Hemal) to exrel them.   It may be that the Greek Army, in its desire for demobilisation,  may be  willing even to Abandon Smyrna.  But it seems to be  more likely that the Greek people and tho Greek troops will on no account agree to its surrender,  arid that Oonstantine,. if he were threatened with its loss, would  proceed there hires elf,  appeal to  his troops,and defy the Powers to eject him.    Both  these suggestions,however,  (i.e. (4)  and (5))  involve a complete revision of theTreaty and raise the  question whether it  is  either the d.esire or the interest  of the Powers that it should  be so revised.    .$he question has to some extent  been prejudged by the fact that the  Italian Government  has  already,  for  political reasons,  ratified  the Treaty b^&apos; Hoyal Decree,  and  is  pressingTurkey to ratify also.    In  the circumstances  it would appearto be impossible for  the Italian  Government  to consent to ageneral revision.     Let it also be realised what  a general  revision at  thisstage would mean..     (a)   It will  involve the continuance of a state  of war          with Turkey and the indefinite  postponement          of peace.     (b)   It will  entail  mother  meeting of  an Inter          Allied Conferfmce,  and  later  or the  supreme        &apos;  Council,  to consider and agree  upon  the  revision.          At these meetings  Japan  as  well as the  three          Great  European Powers will  have to be present
(c) If a revised Treaty be prepared and agreed to by them, it will have to be presented for signature and subsequent ratification to Turkish Government:

(d) But it is perfectly certain that revision cannot in such conditions be confined to Smyrna or the Straits alone. The same argument will be applied to Thrace, and the claim of Turkey and Bulgaria will again be heard. Turkey will herself revive the question of Constantinople, the Tripartite Agreement will come under review if only because the Italians will want to succeed to the Greek heritage in the Smyrna district, and we shall be plunged once more in the morass of the Eastern question.

(e) Such a revision may at any moment be complicated and prejudiced by the appearance of Mustafa Kemal as a military factor of some importance. He may even, instead of accepting terms be in a position to dictate them:

(f) The Treaty if revised will required the assent of oil the signatories of the exisitng Treaty, viz: Armenia, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Serbia and Czecho-Slovakia;   

In these circumstances it seems doubtful whether the great Powers would be wise on their own initiative to destroy the Treaty which they have so recently made. Will it not be better to stand by the Treaty for the present and to press for its ratification, but if owing to the failure of Greece to fulfil her obligations as to maintain her troops, the Treaty is broken or crumbles at any point, to seize the occasion to make better terms with the Turk at the point concerned. For instance if Greece were voluntarily to withdraw from Smyrna, she would then have broken the Treaty herself, and we could repair the damage with the Turks. In this way, if the Greeks be as feeble, or treacherous or war weary as is supposed by some








the Treaty will he almost automatically  revised step bystep,  without the prolonged delay and  convulsion of acomplete reconstruction now.   In these circumstances thebest policy may well be to adhere for  the present  to theTreaty,  and even to make adherence to  it the  test  ofacquiescence by the Great Powers in this or that nominationto the Greek Throne.     If it be thought difficult  to prevent Constantino fromreturning as King,  the Powers might conceivably say thatthey will only recognise any new King  (and this could apply equally to father and son) if he accepts certain con-ditions which might be as follows :-     (1) Full and complete adherence to  all the peace         Treaties signed by the  late Greek Government,         and unqualified and loyal acceptance of their         policy and obligations.  This would  apply to         the Turkish, as well as to all  the other  post-         war Treaties.    ( )  An absolute undertaking to refrain from persecu-         tion or prosecution of  VenizclJ^ts,  and an         amnesty for all political prisoners.    (3)  It might be possible to add a condition that         Greek officials or military officers who  had         acquired an unenviable  notoriety in  the war         for their Anti-Ally attitude  or action, should         be debarred from all official employment.    (4)  Refusal to allow any of the crowned  heads or         leading figures who fought against the Allied         Cause in the recent war to enter Greek territory.     (5) An undertaking on the part of Greece to enter         into no alliance and to make  no agreement with         other states or Governments without  the consent
422         of the Great Allied powers (or alternatively         of the council of the League of Nations).         Such a provision might prevent the Greek         Government from making a private and corrupt         bargain with,e.g. Mustapha Kemal over         Smyrna or elsewhere.     (6)  isro loan to be contracted by the King or         Greek Government without the approval of         the Allied Financial Commission at Athens.     Such conditions would be an effective check eitherupon the father or the son.  If they were subsequentlybroken by whichever of the two was king, recognitioncould be withdrawn, and any penalties that were thought                                               *desirable could be inflicted.     It would be a matter for discussion whether suchan intimation if agreed upon should be made to the  GreekGovernment or the Greek people and at what stage.     The policy of choosing,  or requiring the GreekGovernment to chose the son,  which is favoured by M.Ver-izelos, is attended by the following difficulties  -that the Greek electors may decline to vote for anyonebut  constantine, that the Greek Government may&quot; not  be strong enough to impose the son,  that the latter, evenif invited may decline the nomination,, and that if  .nominated and chosen he may be either a phantom or  apuppet in the hands of his father.     The question really turns in the last resort uponthe policy of adherence to the Treaty; and if thisquestion be  Answered in the  affirmative, upon theacceptance of the candidate for the Greek Throne who  is most likely to be true to it.
