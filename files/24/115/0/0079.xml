This Document  is theiperty ofvern merit                 From. Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,             613&amp;                             ; 24th November 1920.                             (Received 25th, 10 a.m.)     Clear the line.     1349  S.   Our  telegram  dated  1st  November, 1266  S.  Reply  dated 16thNovember received yesterday.     Summary : &quot; Amir expresses pleasure at my agreeing to despatch of envoy toKabul to conclude a treaty.   Sole object of his Government is to live on good terms with neighbouring Governments and  secure Afghanistan&apos;s prosperity.   No one  canobject to Afghanistan being independent, entering into relations with her neighbours.Afghanistan wanted at an early date to enter into relations with Russian Government,which has been strengthening herself for last (? three years)  and has now enteredinto commercial  and even  political relations  and discussions  with Great Britain.It was, moreover, vital to settle up violation of  territory by old Tsarist  Government(take LF.O.C.C. 1906), but the discussions and agreements entered into with Russia(? continue) on such foundations  as will in no  way disturb lawful rights of your government.  (Take original cypher.)   Amir ridicules the  idea of  Consulates beingever established  in  return  for subsidy.  As result of discussions with Russia (moreexhaustive than Mussoorie  discussions) Russian,Ambassador is  now at Kabul,, whileAfghan Envoys and Consuls are  located at various places in Russia.   Any Govern-ment which seeks to locate  Consulate in Afghanistan will have to conform with international usage, which does not permit of Consulates extending their scope fromtrade to politics, and its Consulate therefore will have to  abstain  from  meddling in politics of Afghanistan and neighbouring. Governments.  (Take  LF.O&apos;.C.C.  1906.)I confidentially assure you  that;  just  as  matter  of Russian Consulates at Kandaharand Ghazni has  (? not omitted) yet  been formally and finally arranged, so they  will never be established for the purpose of causing harm to and creating mischief in yourdominions.  (Take orignal cypher.)  Amir therefore believes he  (? we) will expeditedespatch of envoy.  As nothing has happened  to disturb indications of  friendshipgiven on his behalf at Mussoorie, I am  to entertain no doubt that even greater proof of real amity will be given in future discussions at Kabul.     &quot; He expresses the hope that early completion of peace between (sic) discussionswill prove beneficial in matter of Waziristan, long a cause of misunderstanding.  Ifoperations against Wazirs are suspended until coming of envoy, Amir is sure matterscan be settled without injury to us or Afghanistan or oppression of Waziristan.     &quot; He concludes by declining to share  my regret at prospect of leaving India withtreaty unconcluded, as he has strong hope of its prior  conclusion,&quot;     Tarsi addressed letter to Foreign Secretary on same date.          -     Summary : &quot; He is  confident that Amir&apos;s replies are  &apos; reasonable  to same extent as Yiceroy&apos;s enquiries are,&apos; and that, after  they have been  carefully weighed, therecan be no difficulty over despatch of envoy.   &apos; My Government consider it injurious to its interests to become the means of harm from the  Russian  Government reachingyour borders.&apos;  (? As regards) Waziristan, Mussoorie memoranda solved all questions,and &apos; there will be no necessity, for any difficulty which may cause delay.&apos;   Still therewill be no harm in taking action after consultation on arrival of envov, who he hopeswill be Dobbs.&quot;       .
