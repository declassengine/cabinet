PROPOSED IMPERIAL POWER CONFERENCE.

Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.

It has been proposed by responsible officials in different parts of the Empire that the Board of Trade should convene an Imperial Conference to discuss Water and Fuel Power questions.

Broadly, the suggestion is that the problem of economically developing and utilising vegetable and minoral fuels and the Empire&apos;s Water Power Resources might, with considerable advantage, be discussed from the scientific, technical and trading aspects, by representatives of the various Colonies and other parts of the Empire.

The idea was considered in some detail at an informal meeting of representatives of the Departments who would mainly be concerned, (India Office, Colonial Office, Petroleum Department, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, and the Electricity Commission), and was generally approved.

I think it is clear that an interchange of details of the experience gained in the production and transmission of power, especially in modern large scale plant, and the application of electricity to particular uses (electro-chemical, electrometallurgical, and to farming) would facilitate a more speedy development of places less advanced; and that undoubted benefit would result from the attention that would inevitably be drawn to the water power resources of the Empire, and the desirability of investigating and utilising the very large proportion of them as yet undeveloped. A discussion of the potentialities of various parts of the Empire as sources of alcohol to be used for power purposes in the place of petrol might also be productive of very beneficial results. Incidentally, such a Conference might, by providing an opportunity for the various Colonies, etc. to explain to British manufacturers their special requirements, lead to the retention within the Empire of orders for power plant which now go elsewhere. Moreover, in addition to those specific advantages, the intangible benefits that are likely to result from concentrating in the United Kingdom the discussion of problems more or less common to the Empire must not be lost sight of.

If the suggestion be approved, I propose to take immediate steps to call a Conference for the summer of 1921. The procedure in connection with the conduct of the highly successful Imperial Forestry Conference held in July of this year might well be adopted in the present case.                                                                                                          R.S.H.                                                                                           23.11.20
