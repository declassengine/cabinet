MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    I circulate herewith a memorandum on the subject of a proposed Amendment of Gen. No.the Fair  Wages  Resolution in  reference to Government Contracts.                   6359                                                                   W. S. C.  THE WAK OFFICE,    25th November, 1920.     1. The  Army Council have had  under  their consideration  the recommendation contained in paragraph 2 of the Draft Conclusions of the Conference of Ministers of the 4th instant that firms who do not observe the principles of the Fair Wages Resolution in their  private trades should be excluded from  the approved  list  of Government contractors.     2. The  Conference  of Ministers  were  no doubt  influenced in  making their recommendation by the opinion arrived at  by the Fair Wages Advisory Committee at their meeting on 15th January, 1920, that &quot;the argument previously advanced against the  proposed   amendment had  now  diminished  in  force  and  that  the  suggested amendment  to  the Fair Wages Resolution should be proceeded  with.&quot;  The Council are not aware of the  reasons which led the Committee to adopt  this resolution as the minutes of the meeting give no indication of them, but in any case, as the War Office was not responsible for Army Contract business  in January last, it was not represented on the Committee, and cannot be held to have agreed to the conclusions then arrived at.     3. The Council desire  to call  the attention of the Cabinet to  the objections to the proposed amendment  set forth by  the then Secretary of State for War in Memorandum G.T. 4998, dated  29th June,  1918 (printed in  the Appendix), when it was previously considered by the Committee on Home Affairs on 1st August, 1918.     4. As  far  as the War Office  is concerned  the objections  raised in  1918 by Lord  Milner still hold  good and the Council  desire  specially to  emphasize  the importance  of the considerations set forth in paragraph 4 of  the Memorandum.  They view with serious misgiving the risk which  would be incurred  under the  amended resolution, of firms with a large private trade refusing to compete for Government orders (which might be relatively unimportant to  them), if they are  thereby  made liable to be called on to justify the conduct of their private business to the  Departmental authorities,  and also the danger and inconvenience which may arise from endeavours on the part of Trades  Unions to  make  use of   the  machinery  of the  Government Contracting Departments for enforcing their views as to the conduct of the private trade of firms on the approved lists.    5. Attention  is also drawn to the observations in paragraph 6 of Lord Milners Memorandum as to the ambiguity of  the amended resolution.    6. In these circumstances, before effect is given to the decision  of the Conference uf Ministers of the 4th instant, it is suggested that  the proposal of the Ministry of Labour should be referred to a Special Committee under Cabinet authority, before which  theWar Office should be  heard.(B20/466) 100  11/20 H&amp;S, Ltd.  8721wo
FAIR  WAGES CLAUSE AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.                MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WAR.   (G.T. 4998.)Contracts      1.  The proposal of the Minister of Labour  in G.T. 4805  is that the  Fair Wages labour  Resolution of the House of Commons should be amended so as to impose on Government  4092   Departments the  duty of  securing that  firms included on their lists  of approved        contractors shall observe the principles of that Resolution  in regard to  their private as        well as  their Government work.  This would  be a definite extension of the policy        hitherto followed by the  War Department,  which has  not  gone further as  regards        private  work than (a) to  ascertain, as far  as  possible, before placing a firm on  the list,        that its labour conditions were generally  satisfactory and (b) in  the  case of a  firm        already on  the list, to take disciplinary  action, by removal  or suspension, where it        appeared that the wages paid or hours worked on private work were such as to amount        practically  to &quot; sweating &quot; or to constitute the firm a &quot; notoriously bad employer.&quot;             It may be noted that in the course  of the  debate  in the House of Commons on        10th March, 1909, when the present Fair Wages Resolution was passed the  Government        were pressed to extend its operation to the Contractors private work, but they  resisted        such an extension, and  Mr. (now Lord) Buxton said : &quot; I do not think  it is within the        power of the Government to insist that the wages shall be on  the  same level.....        The Fair Wages Resolution applies, as a legal obligation, only to workers  engaged on        the Government Contract in question.&quot;             2.  As  the Minister of Labour mentions in his  memorandum, the Resolution of  the        Parliamentary Committee  of the Trades  Union Congress was referred  to the Fair        Wages Advisory Committee, but it should be  noted that  that Committee in its Report        makes  no recommendation in favour of the  proposed change  of  policy,  but  merely        describes the existing practice of Contracting Departments.             3. The memorandum  states that &quot;it appears desirable that  the position  of  the        Contracting Departments should be strengthened in this respect,&quot; but there is no evidence        that there  is any general desire on the part  of Contracting  Departments for such        extension of the  scope of the Fair Wages Resolution.  Certainly,  so far as the War        Office is concerned, nothing  has  occurred to  suggest that  the proposed change is        necessary or desirable, or that the present practice has encouraged the existence of any        serious or widespread abuses.            4.  On  the other hand,  there is serious danger that the proposed  change would        prejudicially affect  the execution of Government contracts,  since  it  would tend to        restrict the field of competition by preventing many reputable firms from undertaking        Government work, not  because  the labour conditions on  their private  work will not        bear examination, but because they  prefer not to expose  themselves to  the liability of        having their whole  business and factory arrangements investigated by a Government        enquiry, whenever  a disaffected workman  chooses to lodge a complaint.  It may be        argued that this liability already exists, to some extent, under the present system;  but        it is one thing for a Department to have  a  policy of striking off  its list, at its own        -discretion, a firm which is shown to be definitely  &quot;bad&quot; on its private work; it is quite        another  for  the  Department  to place all the firms on its  lists in the  position of being        liable1 to be arraigned  at  any moment  on  the  charge of failing,  in some particular        respect,  to observe the standard district  conditions on their private work, and to bind!        itself to black-list any  firm against whom such  a charge  is held to have been proved.        Firms whose Government work is limited to a particular department of their business,.        or  is relatively unimportant in comparison with their  private trade, are  particularly        likely to be deterred from  undertaking  Government contracts by these  considerations,.        but these are the firms which it is sound  policy to encourage, in  preference to firms        which exist wholly or mainly on. Government work.            5.  Such a wide extension of the field  of  possible complaints must  add greatly to        the labour  involved in the  administration of the Fair Wages Clause by Contracting        Departments, especially where  a  firm serves more  than  one  Department, and may        possibly  involve  the institution of a special  tribunal  (either under the Ministry of        Labour,  or  independent of any Government  Department) to  adjudicate  upon cases        arising  under the  clause.  Such a  tribunal  may easily  be a  source of considerableAPPENDIX.
29th June, 1918.embarrassment to Contracting Departments, if its decisions are liable to entail the black-listing  of, and immediate termination of all contracts held by important, and perhaps indispensable, contractors.     6. The wording of the amendment to the Fair Wages resolution  proposed by theMinister of  Labour, which  requires contractors  to &quot; observe  the  principles  of theresolution,  as regards rates  of wages or hours of labour,&quot; in respect of their privatework, is ambiguous,  and is likely to give  rise to difficulties  in administration.   Underthe Fair Wages Clause contractors undertake, as regards their  Government contracts,to &quot;observe  and fulfill the  obligations&quot;  specified  in the resolution.   Is &quot;principles&quot;intended to  mean something less  than &quot; obligations,&quot; and, if so, what  is the  precisesignificance of the distinction ?  In  particular, would all awards made,  e.g., by theCommittee on Production, and all rates fixed by Order of the  Minister of Munitions,automatically become payable under the terms of the amendment on private as well as government  work ?   I  think any such  course requires  the fullest consideration before it is entered upon.                                                                        MILNER.
