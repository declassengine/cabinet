[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1920.secret.P.-2139.CABINET.FINANCIAL POSITION OF AUSTRIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.     1  CIRCULATE herewith (1) a report dated the 1st November, to the Repara-tion Commission by its Austrian Section on the financial and economic position ofAustria  containing recommendations  as  to the  measures  immediately necessary;(2) a resolution passed by the Reparation Commission thereon on the 13th November;(3) a note prepared by Sir William Goode, at my request, on the consequences of a refusal of direct aid to German Austria;  (4) a  statement of the credits granted bythe Lending Countries under the International Relief Scheme for which  10,000,000was voted by Great Britain in 1920-21.     Out of the vote  5,545,000 has been&apos;allocated to Austria.  The French contri-bution to the scheme consists in the loan of a flat on the sixth floor of an annex to theFrench Foreign Office.  Italy has made no contribution.     In addition,  this  country  spent for Austrian  relief, out  of the vote for 12,500,000  for reconstruction  in  1920-21,  $16,000,000  and   1,400,000,  say 4,750,000 in all.     I  feel strongly that the time has come to take a definite stand on the ground thatthe British Government cannot  place further burdens on the British taxpayer forthe  benefit  of  Austria.  There is a sum of  about   1,100,000  still remainingunallocated out of the  10,000.000 Relief Loan voted this year.  In my view, unlessthe Cabinet think it essential to reserve some part of this sum for Poland, it shouldbe finally earmarked for Austria with an intimation that no further direct assistance will be provided and that indirect assistance in  the form of a British guarantee foran Austrian loan will not be granted.     But I think we should express our readiness to consider  sympathetically any proposals, however drastic, that may be recommended by any of the Allied countries who have claims upon  Austria for Reparation or Relief  Loans,  with a view topermitting Austria&apos;s  available assets to be utilised to her best  advantage, and thatfor this purpose we should be ready to postpone to any extent reasonably possible ourprior charges on those assets.  Sir William Goode, however,  to whom I have put thepoint in conversation, states that the surrender  of the whole of the Austrian assetswould  not alter the situation.  In his opinion a  central government cannot be main-tained and there is no possibility of the continued existence of Austria without a loan.(Initialled.)A.

                                     .(1.)FINANCIAL  AND  ECONOMIC POSITION  OF  AUSTRIA  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  AS TO                      MEASURES IMMEDIATELY NECESSARY.         Report by the Austrian Section of  the Reparation Commission.To the Reparation Commission, Paris. .Sirs,                                                        November 1, 1920.    SINCE the first meeting of the Austrian  Section held in Vienna on the  1st July,exhaustive enquiries have been carried out as to the financial and economic positionof Austria.  The result  of these enquiries may be summarised as follows, all the values mentioned being in kronen :     The Austrian National Debt, as estimated  by the Finance Minister, is  approxi-mately 70 milliards.   The note issues  now exceed 23 milliards, as compared with 9-2milliards when  the  Treaty was signed in September 1919.    The State revenues,according to  the Budget  for  the year  ending the 30th June, 1921, are estimated atover 20^ milliards,  as compared with only 6^ milliards for the preceding year, theestimated revenue from direct taxation being calculated at six times that  of 1920.The exports for 1919-20 amount to 9,700,000 quintals, but during the same period the imports of coal and food alone amounted to 42 million and 9^ million quintalsrespectively.   The Finance Minister, Dr. Reisch, has confidentially communicated tothe Section the statement that the deficit for the fiscal year ending: the 30th June,1921, will amount to 32 milliards or more.  This relatively enormous deficit--morethan one and a half times the total revenue can, in large measure, be attributed tothe depreciation of the krone, which  has  fallen over 100 per cent, during  the  four months that the Section has been in Vienna.  This depreciation, in a country mainlydependent upon  imports for its food and coal, has more than doubled the deficit sincethe Finance Minister first drafted his current Budget.  This is due to the increased cost of food supplies purchased by the Government and otherwise not available forthe majority  of the population; to the increased loss on the sale of such supplies tothe public; and to the additional cost  of the Service of the Foreign Debt.  The onlynormal.resource  at the disposal of the Austrian Government to meet this deficit andto procure food supplies, which will be exhausted in December, is to: issue more notes.The inevitable result of such procedure would be further depreciation of the kroneand an increase of the current deficit to 50 milliards, or possibly much&apos; more.    In the opinion of the Section the  position&apos;of Austria, unless speedily remedied,is such as  to prohibit the administration of the State by any Government * and toimperil  the continued existence  of1 the country as a political entity:  It naturallyfollows that,  in many respects, it is1 impossible at present to enforce the ReparationClauses of the Treaty, and  that-the  ultimate ^execution  of  the Treaty  of SaintGermain as a whole must be  dependent upon remedial action of the most urgent anddrastic character;  Unless this- is  taken  the  dissolution of all  social and economic life in Austria will be automatic and inevitable, and even if this is not accompaniedby violence, the consequent suffering and distress would&apos;compel the intervention ofthe civilised world. -      &quot;     *     &apos;   - ;  ;    The Section therefore, after prolonged examination, unanimously  agree uponthe attached  proposals.  In  their  opinion it is impossible for Austria to  continueto exist without  external assistance.   If this is  forthcoming to an extent that wouldenable a financial programme for Austria to be formulated for the next five or six years, and if simultaneously a comprehensive scheme of internal reconstruction undereffectual  control  was put  into execution, there is reason to think that Austria might eventually  become self-supporting and cease to be  a menace to the political andeconomic stability of Central and  Eastern Europe.  Temporary  palliatives or anyattempt at half-way measures will, in the opinion of the Section,  only involve a loss to those undertaking them and will fail to assist towards the ultimate solution.  There-establishment  of Austria  must  necessarily be slow and relatively costly, but  ifincreased production and development of potential resources,  such as water  power,are assiduously  pursued, combined with  economies  in expenditure and the gradualrecovery  of the krone, Austria should regain the power to expoTt, and the possibilityto exist.
The proposals of the Section may be briefly summarised as follows :-(A.) A foreign money loan of 250  million dollars to be issued in instalments      over five years. The loan to be contingent upon  control of Austrian      public finance.(B.) The foundation of a Privileged Bank of Issue.(C.) The funding of the Services of  the Austrian Foreign Debt and the Debt of      the City of Vienna.(D.) An internal loan guaranteed by the Entente Powers, with the proceeds of      the Austrian Capital Levy as security.(E.) The assurance of an  additional 200,000 tons of coal and coke monthly.(F.) The development of Austria&apos;s water power by foreign capital, primarily for      industrial purposes, and the  provision  of  subsidies   and concessions      therefor.(G.)  A suggested transitory Customs tariff.(H.)  Increased production of potatoes by means  of a productive credit, and(      increased production of cereals, milk and sugar, coupled with the substitu-      tion of minimum for maximum prices and the enforcement  of  food      restrictions.(I.) A non-Partisan Budget Commission to effect State, Provincial and municipal      economies and to rearrange the revenues of State Services in order to meet      the costs involved.(J.) Reduction of the Army to a force not to  exceed 5,000.(K.)  Management of State monopolies and State-owned enterprises  by private      capital.(L.)  Co-operation of labour towards increased production.                  We are, etc.,           (Signed)      WILLIAM GOODE.        KLOBUKOWSKI.                                       Two Representatives.                                     (2.)    RESOLUTION OF THE REPARATION COMMISSION, DATED NOVEMBER 13, 1920.    THE  Reparation  Commission,  without  pronouncing  upon  the  proposals contained in the unanimous report of  the  Representatives of the nine  Powersconstituting the Austrian Section, considers that that report gives an accurate presen-tation of the present economic and financial position of Austria.    This statement of facts not only demonstrates the impossibility of at presentenforcing adequately the Reparation Clauses of the Treaty of Saint Germain, butindeed, raises the most serious doubts as to the possibility of ensuring the continued existence of the present  Republic of  Austria as a political entity, unless further financial aid can be provided from external sources.    As  the  Reparation Commission has no funds at its disposal out of which such assistance could be  provided, the issue raised is one  which exceeds  the competence of the Commission.   The  Commission therefore  decides  that  the  report of theAustrian Section be  forwarded  to the  Allied  and  Associated Powers for their immediate consideration.                                     (3.)        CONSEQUENCES OF A REFUSAL OF DIRECT AID TO GERM AN-AUSTRIA.                          Note by Sir William Goode.The  Chancellor of the Exchequer,     IN accordance with your directions I submit a forecast of what may reasonablyhappen in Austria if the external financial assistance, which the Reparation Commis-sion  and the Austrian Section report as necessary, is not forthcoming.     It is evident than no  Central Government can continue to exist on a deficitnearly twice the amount  of the total revenue, or continue to purchase from abroad75 per cent, of the fundamental food supplies by pawning, as they are at present,State-owned objects of Art.   Opinions vary as to when the krone will cease to have      [4932]                                                        B 2
any real purchasing power and when the collapse of Central Government will occur,some placing it at three months  hence, others at  six months.  Personally,  I am inclined to think the latter estimate the more probable.  I do not share the general public  opinion  that before  or  at the time of such  collapse Austria would joinGermany en bloc.  The leaders of the Pan-German Party in Austria have privatelyadmitted to me that they are well aware that Germany at present can neither feednor support Austria.   The likelihood of the  whole  of Austria joining Germany is neither a danger nor  a remedy.    It seems to me most probable that each of the seven provinces, finding themselveswithout Central Government, will attempt to choose their own destiny. Vorarlbergwould  undoubtedly throw herself into the arms of Switzerland, whether or not she were wanted.  Tyrol, Salzburg and Upper Austria would probably declare themselvesto be part of Bavaria.   It would be politically embarrassing for Bavaria to disengageherself&apos;from these impecunious next-door neighbours.  Lower Austria, Styria andCarinthia might share the desire to join Bavaria,  but their  geographical positionwould  make it more difficult for them  to force themselves on a country that might be unwilling to adopt them.    I have no special  information as to  the foreign policy of Italy, Czecho-Slovakiaand  Jugo-Slavia,  but I  should  think  it highly  probable. that Italy would  thenendeavour  to occupy  Tyrol  and  Salzburg  by force and thereby obtain  a common frontier with  Germany.   Jugo-Slavia would almost certainly endeavour to secureStyria and part of Lower Austria for  herself, while  Czecho-Slovakia would take similar steps to occupy another part of Lower and  Upper  Austria.  The AustrianDanube might then become a common frontier for  Czecho-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia.The destiny of  Carinthia would remain  to be settled between Italy and Jugo-Slavia.The. probability of serious international disputes during the pTocess of this  disintegration-tegration is too apparent to  require more than passing mention.    As regards Vienna herself.  If the Christian  Socialists are still in power on the eve of the debacle it is  not improbable that they would appeal to their political friends in Hungary to  protect Vienna from  anticipated occupation by the Czechs.  In any event,  one  must be prepared to see both  Czech  and  Hungarian armies marchingagainst Vienna in order  to protect it from each other. Under the recent defensivealliance  between  Czecho-Slovakia  and Jugo-Slavia, the  latter  country  would undoubtedly regard the action of Hungary in relation to Vienna as an unprovokedattack.on Czecho-Slovakia and would therefore consider herself justified in invadingHungary.   ......  .;.  ,   j,....... t    At the moment, Austria is, perhaps, one of the least Bolshevik of all her neigh-bours.  Without,wishing to be alarmist, she could, not be expected to remain so in caseof disintegration or occupation.   Her small army, the Wehrmacht, in the event of govermental collapse would undoubtedly  be. inclined to. support any  Bolshevikmovement and  to ally itself with the, Bolshevik element in. Czecho-Slovakia, whichis already sufficiently  dangerous.  The, Bolsheviks  would naturally spare no pains^Ormoney to  profit, by. the unrest in Austria and to  utilise her excellent geographicalsituation as.a centre for propaganda and action in order to create a solid BolshevikWoe from the Baltic to the Danube.    There.naturally must be many possible variants of this forecast as to what mayhappen politically if  financial assistance for Austria is not. forthcoming.  It doesseem certain, however, that  the alternative to such assistance involves the breaking up of  what is now a &quot;buffer State &quot; between Germany  and the Adriatic and the raising of territorial issues, any one  of which  may lead to  another  war or to a recrudescence  of European  Bolshevism.  I have  not touched upon the widespreadhuman suffering, or the economic consequences on  Europe itself and upon our efforts to re-establish British trade  with Central Europe,  which are likely to result from the dissolution of Austria.  I know  from your personal interest in the previous BritishRelief Credits that you are fully informed on these points.                               *         WILLIAM.
