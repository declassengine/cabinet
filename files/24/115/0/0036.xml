Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.                     MESOPOTAMIAN  AFFAIRS.     When Sir Percy Cox was in this country and was present at discussions in theCabinet on  the  future of Mesopotamia,  lie stipulated, as one of the conditions  onwhich he would  accept the position of High Commissioner, that the abolition of the dual or triparti control of  Mesopotatnian affairs  should be abolished and that middle eastern matters  should be collected in one Department.  Sir P. Cox, in the telegramsattached, has  now reminded His Majesty&apos;s Government of their obligation  in thismatter.     There have  been cases in which Ministers have been reluctant to part with theirreponsibilities, but I am in cordial agreement with the High Commissioner in Mesopo-tamia that the India Office should no longer be responsible for Mesopotamia.  Indeed,that proposition has  received  almost  universal  asseut.  and  1 only expressed myagreement accompanied by a tribute to the work which my Office  and our  officers  inMesopotamia have performed.     But the India Office is not staffed for  this  work, and the duality of  function forthe Secretary  of State for India  in Council as  regards India and also as regardsMesopotamia is anomalous.     The question was last raised by Lord Curzon  on 17th August, just before the adjournment for  the summer holidays.  The Prime Minister then said that in Octoberhe would have proposals to make to the Cabinet.  I plead that those proposals  shouldbe considered and a decision reached.  This is essential, in my view, not only becauseof our pledge to Sir  Percy Cox, but in  the interests of policy, economy and  properadministration.  There is the question of organising a civil  administrative  service which the Arab  State will require  when  it comes into being ; and in fairness to theBritish officers who have been serving in Mesopotamia for the last five  years, and ofwhom 50  per cent, are shortly to  be turned adrift, Sir P. Cox  must be  put in aposition to say  something very soon to them about their future.  Again, it is onlyto-day that  I  have before me  a  file concerning  so  small  a matter as the cost  ofrepatriating to Mesopotamia  the Mesopotamian  officers who fought for us in the war against the Turks and who are now in Syria.   Correspondence has been going  oilbetween the India Office, the Foreign Office, the War  Office and the Treasury for twomonths,  and we are only now abie to reach a decision on  a small administrativematter, yet one  of  some political  importance, which  ought to have been decided in afew  days between  the Treasury and the  Middle  Eastern Department.  Meanwhile,these men,  who have been  ejected from  Syria by the  French, are  waiting, anddoubtless growing more discontented, in Egypt.                                                                    E. S. M.  &apos;     18th November 1920.         Telegram from High Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State,                            dated 3rd November 1920.    The visible development of principle of  national Government for Irak, involvingas it does the (? gradual) reduction and dispersal of British personnel now serving inCivil Administration, inevitably creates in the minds of every individual a feeling of uncertainty as to the  safety of his  future career.  This is  natural and temporarilyunavoidable, but. His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree that it is very important thatin the case of those who will be wanted permanently, and who are willing to remain,their  positions  should be regulated with least  possible delay by the  creation ofrecognised Civil Service.  In this connection it will be  remembered that one of thestipulations I ventured to make, when accepting this appointment, was that principleof creation of Ministry or Sub-Ministry and  Civil Service for  the block of countriesincluded in Middle East having been accepted, project should be carried to a solutionwithout delay.   In  enquiring to  what extent  it has developed  since I left London.I beg  at the same time to urge that it be pressed to early conclusion,   3770   100 11.20
       Telegram from the High Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State,                           dated 10th November 1920.    Supposing that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to endorse terms thereof,more especially first two paragraphs, I propose send following  message to Mesopo-mesopotamian Agents in Bombay and London for communication to all officers on leave:     &quot; Following applies to executive officers,  i,e., Political Officers  and AssistantPolitical Officers (sic) only.    &quot; Proposals are under consideration of  His Majesty&apos;s Government for formationof permanent Middle  Eastern  Civil  Service.   Officers  selected for retention  inMesopotamian service will automatically become members of this, if and when it takes shape.    &quot; No information available at present as to pay and pension proposed for service,nor can it be stated whether permanent service in Mesopotamia can be guaranteed.    &quot; Inasmuch  as  National  Government  will involve considerable  reduction  ofBritish executive  staff,  I contemplate  reduction  of  about  50 per  cent,  to begin with.   Please therefore state whether you desire your name put forward for retentionor not.    &quot;Those  not selected for  retention will receive same treatment in respect  of gatuities as if their contracts had been terminated by Government on three months&apos;notice.  Every effort will be made to release those who are not selected for retentionat time most convenient for them.&quot;    Kindly telegraph confirmation, and, if text  approved,  instruct;  MesopotamianAgent at  India Office (? accordingly).
