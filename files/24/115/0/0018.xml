      Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.^^tIS^^          Th&apos;3  Document is tho  Property of                        His B-114 ; ( ...O.Pf^2 1l8            y^Mlegram from Viceroy, Home- Department, lUh November 1920.A-/./ ^ j r Q^l^\&apos;ing is weekly telegram :      .....-.....&quot;Speech of Viceroy on 4th November,  replying to address of Sylhet Moliamedans,    * and issue on Cth November of Home  Department resolution  on the subject on non-     co-operation, appear to have met to some extent general demand for further public     declaration  of  Governments  attitude towards  that movement.   Viceroy thanked     Mohamedans for recognition of Governments  efforts to secure favourable terms  for     Turkeyy and assured them that  in every thing affecting welfare of Turkey and status     of Khilafat, influence of India would always be thrown in direction desired by India&apos;s     Moslems.   Territories  inhabited by Turkish  race is (? are) intact,, and her finances     free from any share of  the  burden of reparation debt.  She would  soon  have round     her ring of (? independent) but friendly Moslem States.  Need of moment was  to     assist her  to rebuild  on  good  foundations.  His Excellency added  few  words  on     non-co-operation, from which  he  said  people themselves  were chief  sufferers,     instancing Hijrat disaster and  attack  on Aligarh College.  Poor Moslem boys, whose     education disturbed, and  perhaps wrecked, were chief  sufferers  from latter.   He     therefore appealed to  Mohamedans, who were more  keen about educational advance-     ment than anything else, to rally round their  educational institutions and repudiate     policy  of  non-co-operation.   Speech   has  produced  good  impression  and  been     favourably  received by Press.   Press  notices of Home Department resolution have     also been on the  whole  distinctly favourable.  While certain papers like EnglisJiman     criticise resolution as throwing on moderates  burden of organising counter propaganda     which  ought to be undertaken by  Government itself,  majority  of  Knglish and     moderate papers such  as  Pioneer, Statesman, Civil and  Military Gazette, Times of     India,  New India,  Bengali and Leader welcome resolution as timely exposition  of     Governments policy, which has been on the whole successful and should be continued.     Bengali and Leader  strongly deprecate resort  to repressive action, latter adding that     only real remedy for the present unrest is redress of Khilafat and Punjab wrongs.     Even extremist papers  admit temperate tone of  resolution, though they deny that  it     affords any solution to present  difficulties, which  can only be cured  by repentance of     Government.  Sir 0. Setalvad, who lias  returned to public  life, made  noteworthy     contribution to  discussion  in  recent  Press  interview.  He  condemned stronglv     exhibition made  by non-co-operators, who broke up recent lecture of Mrs. Besant,     dwelt on dangers of  stirring up class and  racial hatred, emphasised folly of spurning     opportunities afforded by Reforms Act,  denounced the mischievous boycott of schools,     and concluded with  appeal  to Government  to heal wounds  inflicted on India&apos;s self-     respect by  doings in Punjab,  mishandling  of Khilafat question and  treatment  of     Indians in British dominions.        Pandit Madan  Mohan  Malaviya made  important speech  to  students of Hindu     University on 1st November. While agreeing (? that) attainment of full responsibility     of Government under British Crown is only certain remedy for  India&apos;s  wrongs, lie     did not think  that  this  would  be  secured by  non-co-operation.  He was  wholly     opposed to withdrawing of boys and girls from schools and colleges and abandonment     of Government grants, which in case  of Hindu University would  probably  result  in     loss of much lucrative aid [i.e., support of Chiefs and Zamindars).  Press  telegram     yesterday states that non-co-operators are active in Hindu  University, but professors     and students fully appreciate situation.   Next meeting  (?  of) Court fixed for  30th     November.   From Aligarh, Mohamed Ali, College  Secretary, and Mohamed Ali,     politician, maintain wordy controversy in Press, but  there  is growing  evidence that     sober Mohamedan opinion is disgusted by efforts of latter to wreck Aligarh and other    Mohamedan institutions, and counter-propaganda is being organised both in Northern    India and elsewhere.        Madras reports that useful speech was made by Mr. Justice Abdul Rahim  before    Mohamedan Education Association, condemning methods of Gandhi and Ali brothers.        Mr. Andrews lias just offered  his services to new National University founded by    Mohamed Ali.        Calcutta branch of the European  Association, at  annual  meeting  on 8th    November, passed resolution approving  action  of  General Dyer in going beyond         2742    100   11.20
immediate  needs of moment at Jallianwala Bagli.  Resolution most inopportune;result can only be further  irritation of Indian feeling at time when we are calling upon all moderate Indians to take united action against non-co-operation.     Punjab.-On account of increased violence of public speech, Local Governmenthas  cancelled exemption  Amritsar  City from scope of  Seditious Meetings Act, and asked us to sanction extension of the Act to whole of Punjab with a view of immediate introduction in districts of Jullundur and Hoshyarpur.  Orders have been postponedon this request, pending consideration in Council on 17th November, full statement of reasons being  called for.  Mangal Singh, editor of Akali, has  been arrested undersection 12-1 (a), and suspension of sentence  granted under amnesty to Singhara Singh &quot;has been cancelled.   These acts have been  condemned  at public meeting  of Sikhsheld in Lahore  on 12th November as proving inauguration  of  policy of repression.Meantime non-co-operation seems to have had little success so far as council electionsare concerned.   Returns up to 9th November show  182 candidates for 55 seats.   Itis significant that co-operation meeting recently held at  Rohtak  was broken up bycounter efforts of co-operators.     According to Press reports, Colonel Wedgwood had  great reception at Lahore on 7th &quot;November.   He  said  that  he had not made up his mind about non-co-operation.What  was necessary was destruction  of present  bureaucratic  Imperialism,  india would never get  her  freedom  from present  Coalition Government, but first LabourParliament would place her in  same  position as Canada.  He assured  Mohamedonsthat, when  this came about,   India  would  be  greatest  Moslem power in world.Wedgwood proceeds  shortly to Peshawar, where Chief Commissioner has invited  Himto be guest.     Bombay. Non-co-operator  clique  endeavoured  in vain to get Indian Merchants&apos;Chamber to pass resolution pledging themselves not to elect representative to Council.Proceedings were dissolved on point of order after they  had  shown large majority  ofspeakers against non-co-operation.  Significant that All-India Trades Union  Congress,under  presidency of  Lajpat  Rai, unanimously adopted  resolution pressing claims ofLabour to have  elected representatives on  Legislative  Councils.   Reports  of  lateOctober showed  campaign of non-co-operation making headway  in  certain districts of Bombay, particularly Broach  and Ahmadabad, but present position unknown.   Itis announced that  Gujerat  National  College  will  be  opened  at  Alimadabad on.15th October (sic).   On  the other hand,  it is reported that much indignation feltamong parents in Ahmadabad  at nationalisation of certain schools.  Many students.withdrawn from  these and entertained in. Government schools, which have temporarilyrelaxed rules of admission.     Delhi. Position  as  regards school boycott believed to be  improved.   ChiefCommissioner, however,  apprehensive regarding  possible  effects  of conference  ofUlema  to be held on 21st and 22nd instant   Has suggested prohibition of  meetings.Proposal will be  considered in Council on 17th November.     Madras. Local Government reports that trouble at Buckingham Mills largely dueto intrigues of disappointed European Assistants  (compare case  of recent KhargpurRailway strike).  Lock-out continues, and Press message states that mill-owners have applied in High  Court for injunction against Wadia and eight others, restraining them from addressing  workmen, and claiming Rs. 75,000 damages.     Burma. Local Government has asked leave to deport  Swami Sardanand, who isalleged to be causing dangerous excitement  by his speeches to  Burman priests and workmen.  We have suggested action under  section 144,  Code of Criminal Procedure,.as preliminary to more  drastic measure of deportation.     Bengal. Local Government reported on 9th November, that situation with regardto police serious, and many districts announced intention of striking on morning of15th November.   Cause, economic, though discontent fanned by agitators.   Danger of force being stampeded  by action of few units.  To  avoid trouble, Local Governmenthas announced further  concession, which we have confirmed  with retrospective  effect from 1st October.     General. Esher Report  has received considerable  attention  in Press. Indian.critics being almost unanimously hostile.     Wheat export continues to be condemned by Indian  Press.
