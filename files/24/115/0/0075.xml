It was not expected then that iftfy heavy expenses consequent upon the removal of the Secretariat to permanent seat and its establishment there would be Incurred during the secondi&amp;fccal period.The Council has now decided that the. transfer should t ake place thisyear and the greater part  0$&apos; the&quot;sum allocated for the creation ofworking capi+al will be absorbed for other gurposes during 1220,        It if, therefore, necessary to include a similar appropriationin the third Budget, in order that the League may always have at its disposal sufficient funds to carry on its work.  This arrangement isvery necessary, owing to the delays which frequently take place inthe voting of credits by Parliaments and the fact that certain Membersof the League, for this reason/ find it impossible to pay their con-tributions as soon as they become due.
