Tho following extract  from tho report of tho Belgian Ropreccn-tativo which was adopted by the Council, contains the provisional agreement, which was reached.1.   The Mandates  Commission provided for by Article  22  of  thoCovenant shall bo  competed of fifteen members.

The British representative requested that the Council should give him l-imo to discuss this provisional agree- ment with the representatives cf the Dominions, who arc to act as Mandatory Powers on behalf of the League, before they wore finally decided upon.   He informed the Council that he hoped to bo  able to hold these discussions at an early date, and that ho v/orrld be able to agree to final decisions at tho present meeting.    III.  If tho Council at the present meeting adopts the plan sot forth in tho report of the Belgian Representative at Brussels it will be desirable that a letter should bo imrmodiatoly addressed to the Govorrmicnto of the non-IJanuatory Members of tho League, through the medium of their delegations at the Assembly, In  case tho Council agrees to this procedure, a draft letter is attached,    IV.  The Secretary-General ventures to suggest to tho Council that, if thoy agree on any plan for tho constitution of the Mandates Commission, thoy should invite the Commission  . to make to the Council any recommendations it may think desirable on the subject of its own organisation and effectiveworking. 12th November, 1920,
