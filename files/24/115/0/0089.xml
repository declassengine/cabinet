[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]             Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.C.P.-2188.                                                                     9                            CABINET.PERMANENT  COURT  OF  INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE.Report presented by the French Representative, M.  Leon Bourgeois, and adopted    by the  Council  of the League  of Nations at  its Meeting  at Brussels  on    October 27, 1920.(Previous Papers :  Nos. B.E.D. 9, 10, 23, 32, 33, 34;  CPs.-1902,1905, 1956, 1962,                               1974 and 2010.)Gentlemen,    AT the last meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at San Sebastianyou were good  enough to approve the terms of the  Report which I presented  onthe subject of the draft scheme  for  the  establishment  of  a  Permanent Court  ofInternational Justice, prepared by the  Committee of Jurists  which you appointed for this purpose.    In order to mark the starting-point of our deliberations to-day, I will read yousome lines of my San Sebastian Report:    &quot; I have indicated, apart from these  provisions  in respect of which no serious difficulty seems to  arise, the points which have specially arrested the attention ofthe) Jurists at The Hague, and which will have to be thoroughly discussed.   Sucha discussion cannot take place to.-day.   We must postpone till one of our forthcomingmeetings the final consideration of the draft, but in the meantime:    &quot; 1. We could circulate to all the  Members of the League,  for their information,a copy of the draft Statutes of The  Hague and  of the Report which explains  its provisions.    &quot; 2.  We could charge one from among ourselves,  who should keep in touch withhis colleagues, to prepare a preliminary Report  as a basis for our final decision,    &quot; We cannot forget that the  provisions of Article  14  of the Covenant impose upon us the formal duty of preparing a plan for the establishment of a PermanentCourt of International Justice and of submitting it  to the Members of the League.It is essential  that before  the General Assembly meets,  the Council should have adopted a definite  position.&quot;    You decided, in agreement with what  I proposed, to  forward to the Governmentsof  the  States  Members of  the League  of Nations tho  scheme prepared by  theAdvisory Committee and the Report presented to this Committee by its Rapporteurtogether with a covering letter, the text of which is  reproduced in the Annex; and you instructed me to prepare, in collaboration with the other members of the Council,a preliminary report on the scheme of the Committee to serve as a basis for the finalopinion of the Council.    Sir Eric Drummond signed these covering  letters, in which he pointed out thatthe Jurisconsults of The Hague had adopted their report unanimously, and added :    &quot; Doubtless the  agreement was not arrived at without difficulty.   Variety of opinions,  even among the  most  competent experts,  is  inevitable on a subject soperplexing and complicated.   Some  mutual  concessions are  therefore necessary ifthe failure of thirteen years ago is not to be repeated.  The  Council would regardan irreconcilable difference of opinion on the merits of the scheme as an internationalmisfortune  of  the gravest  kind.   It would mean  that  the League was  publicly       [5006]                                                       B
compelled to  admit its incapacity to  carry out one of the most important of the tasks which it was invited to perform.  The failure would be great, and probablyirreparable;  for  if agreement  proves impossible under  circumstances apparentlyso favourable, it is hard to see  how and when the task of securing it will be successfully resumed.     &quot; It is in the spirit  indicated by these observations  that the Council on their part propose  to examine the project submitted to them by the Committee of Jurists;and  they trust that in the same spirit the Members of the League will deal with thisall-important subject when the  Council  brings the recommendations before theAssembly.&quot;     The draft scheme and the Report were forwarded to the various governments in order that you might have the benefit  in  your  deliberations of the suggestions which might  seem of interest to you in this purely unofficial discussion.     A certain number of Governments have  already forwarded us their remarks:the Swedish  and Norwegian Governments among those Powers not represented onthe  Council;   and among  the  others, the Belgian, British,  French and italian governments.   Some of these  replies were drawn up in writing, others, such asthose of the Belgian and British  Governments, were presented orally or in a note which was communicated to you during the present Meeting.     The observations which we have received are of very varying importance.   first of all there are  a great number of observations on  points of detail concerning theactual wording of the Articles; I am  of the opinion that this question is not reallythe object of  the Councils deliberations.  We are not an Assembly  of Jurisconsults,and in  the opinion of the public  our  views could not, in  purely technical matters,be of equal weight with those of the eminent  jurists who  have come to a unanimous agreement at  The Hague.  Our task is to examine from the point of view of principle the scheme prepared at  The Hague, and to limit our questions or our objections tothe fundamental points of the system proposed.     The following are the points  which I propose that you should consider :     1.   The obligatory character of the jurisdiction.     2.   The retrospective competence of the Court when the interpretation of Treaties           concluded prior to the establishment of the Court is in question.     3.   Can the Court be considered as competent to deal with Prize Court matters ?     4.   The question of National Judges :  when a country is not represented on the           Tribunal, should a Judge of this country be called upon to sit  on the           Tribunal in order to establish equilibrium between the parties in dispute,           or, on the contrary, should a National Judge be eliminated ?     5.  Relations between the new Court which  we are establishing and the supreme           organisation that the General Assembly and its Council constitute under           the terms of the Covenant  itself.     6.  Position of  the  Judges:  their salaries and  allowances,  the  inconsistencies           which may exist between the office of Judge of the International Court           and other  national and international duties.     7.  Appointment of the candidates.     8.  The  right of intervention in its various  aspects,  and in  particular the           question whether the fact  that the principle implied in a judgment may           affect the  development of international law  in a way which appears           undesirable to any particular State may constitute for it a sufficient  basis           for any kind of intervention in order to impose the contrary views held           by it with regard to this principle.     9.  Choice of the language which  shall be the official language of the Court.     These, Gentlemen, are the essential points.  I will now deal with them in  turn,taking  into  account the observations which have  been  drawn  up by the various1Governments.     ...   -      1. Obligatory character  of  the Jurisdiction.     This is  a question  of  the interpretation of Article  34  of  the  scheme  of TheHague  Jurisconsults.  This Article runs as  follows :     Between States Members of the League of  Nations, the Court will, without special Convention, decide disputes of a Judicial nature which concern:     (a.) The interpretation of  a  Treaty.     (b.) Any point in International  Law.
    (c.) Any fact,  which if it  were established  would constitute a  violation of           international  agreement.    (d.) The nature or extent of the reparations due for the violation of an inter-           national agreement.    (e.) The interpretation of a sentence pronounced by the Court.    The Court  will  also deal with  all disputes of whatever  nature which are submitted to it as the result of a Convention, whether general or special, between theParties.    In case of doubt as to whether a dispute comes within the categories mentionedabove, the Court shall decide.    No difficulty arises when there exists between the parties a general or specialConvention declaring the Court to be competent.   But it remains to be decided whether we can set up a Court  of Justice entitled to consider itself competent togive a decision where no special Convention  exists.   The Jurists at The Haguedecided in the  affirmative.    They considered, in fact,  that  if the Court is madecompetent by agreement  between the Parties a fact which  is incontestible it isdifficult to see why this agreement should not be established by a general Conventionafter discussion by the League of Nations, instead of by a special Convention arrivedat by two or more Parties.    If the Assembly of the League of Nations approves of provisions which establish a Court of Justice  and which imply that tho competence of this  Court in certain matters is binding on all, would not the ratification by the different States of these provisions adopted by the League of Nations be equivalent to a Convention giving to the Court of Justice a  compulsory jurisdiction in matters mentioned in Article 34of the draft scheme?    If this view advanced by the Jurisconsults at The Hague is  adopted without modification, a  considerable  advance has certainly been  made, in view  of  the termsof Article 34.  What must  be understood, then, by the expression &quot; any point rofinternational law &quot;?  Even if the States admitted the compulsory jurisdiction inthe cases definitely laid  down in the Article,  will they consent  to go  so  far as to admit  that  any question of international  law may be submitted to  the  Court?Objections of this  nature have  been raised by several Governments, which have &apos;forwarded us their remarks  on the draft scheme.    The innovation involved in The Hague scheme may be summed up  as  follows :    The decision of the Permanent Court is being substituted for the decision whichthe Council should  take  on the question whether diplomatic  methods of settlementhave or have not been exhausted between the two Parties before their dispute comesbefore the Council, and  a decision of the Permanent Court is substituted for thefree choice allowed to the  Parties by the Covenant with regard to the question whetherthey shall lay their dispute before the Court, before another international Tribunal,or before the Council of  the League of Nations.    This  freedom of choice is  given to Members of  the League of Nations by article 12 of the Covenant.    We do not  think it necessary to discuss  here the advantages which would result from the system of compulsory jurisdiction proposed by the Committee of Juristswith regard to the good administration of international  justice and the developmentof the Court&apos;s authority.  But as in reality a  modification in Articles  12  and 13 ofthe Covenant is here involved, the Council will, no doubt,  consider that.it is not itsduty,  at the moment when the General Assembly of the League of Nations is about to meet for the first time, to take the initiative with regard to proposed alterations in the Covenant, whose observance and safe keeping have been entrusted to it.  If, ona particular  point, whose importance is clear to everyone, it were to  propose  suchalterations, it would also be obliged to express its views with regard to many otheralterations in the Covenant, which certain Governments  have already stated  thatthey intend to lay before the Assembly.          .    At the present  moment  it is most important in the interests of the authorityof the League  of Nations that differences of opinion should not-arise at &quot;the veryoutset with regard to the essential  rules laid down in the Covenant of the  28thApril, 1919.    I  propose, therefore, that we should adopt as the starting-point of,,our sub-sequent deliberations the following resolutions:    Whereas the text proposed by The Hague Jurists tends to modify the principle which gives to the parties the right to choose between the two alternatives of judicial .&apos;   &apos;  [5006J    -                                               : .7B 2,
procedure or appeal to the Council for the settlement of a dispute which has arisen between them:    Whereas this would constitute a modification of Article 12 of the Covenant:    Whereas.at the present time there should bo no question of considering modifica-tions to this Covenant, but rather of applying it:    The Council proposes  to substitute in the draft scheme of The Hague in placeof Articles 33 and 34, the  following Articles-:                                 ARTICLE  33.    The jurisdiction of the Courts is defined by Articles 12,  13 and  14  of theCovenant.                                 ARTICLE  34.    Without prejudice to the  right of the parties according to Articles 12 of theCovenant to submit disputes between them either to judicial settlement or arbitration,or to  enquiry by the  Council,  the Court shall  have jurisdiction (and this withoutany special agreement giving  it  jurisdiction)  to hear  and determine disputes, thesettlement of which is by Treaties in force entrusted to it or to the tribunal instituted by the League of Nations.    It is to be clearly understood that the Secretariat shall be entrusted if need beto bring the terms of the remainder of the draft scheme into harmony with this newwording of Articles 33 and 34.    By adopting this wording  the Council does not in any way wish to declare  itselfopposed to the actual idea of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in questionsof a judicial nature.  This is a development of the authority of the Court of Justicewhich may be extremely useful  in effecting the general settlement of disputes between nations, and the Council would  certainly have no objection to the consideration ofthe problem at some future date.  In upholding the wording which  we have the honour to submit to it, it will  confine itself to declaring that at the present  time itcannot undertake to  propose any modification in  the  provisions of the Covenant,since  such  modifications,  whatever may  be their  particular value,  can  only beintroduced  without danger when they receive the  entirely unanimous approval ofthe members of the League of Nations.                    2. Retrospective competency of the Court.     Certain Governments have  raised  in their observations the question  of theretrospective competence of the  Court.  This retrospective action may shortly be defined  as  the. application  of the organisation and  methods laid  down  in theprovisions  of  the Draft Scheme to  disputes  which are already pending between States at the time of  the  entry into  force of the Convention.     If we  are to establish the principle of  non-retrospection  we should be  obligedto  introduce  a  distinction  between Treaties concluded  prior  to the Court and subsequently to this  document, between  events which  occurred before or after itsentry  into force.  We should be obliged to establish a criterion  to determine whether any particular dispute was already  pending or not  at  the  moment in question. Neither the Convention nor the Draft Scheme of The Hague draws such a distinction nor do- they establish  such a criterion.     But if we adopt the principle contained  in the resolution which I have submitted to  you,  the,whole question  of retrospective action  loses  its  importance since  the jurisdiction is no longer compulsory.     3. Can the Court be considered competent to deal with  prize questions?    The same applies to the  question  whether the Court  can be considered com- petent to deal with matters of prize.  If the compulsory jurisdiction of the  Court were  maintained, a full discussion of this point would be necessary.   The question of prize is, in fact, of a very  special nature.  It has raised very serioUs difficulties and it will be remembered that the Governments have not been  able to agree as to the ratification of the London negotiation.   It would  therefore  be necessary to come to a  decision and to  exclude questions of prize from the compulsory jurisdiction pf
the Court.  But if you have adopted the principle which I had the honour to proposeat the beginning of this Report, and if the Court  is only competent under the condi-tions laid down by Articles 12 and 13 of the Covenant, one may say that the questionceases to arise.  Each party  is naturally free to submit to the Court of Justice aprize dispute, if both parties consider this Court to be suitable.                     4. The Question of National Judges.    It is clearly  essential to put the contending Parties before the PermanentCourt of International Justice on a footing of complete equality.  If only one of the,two parties is represented, one may, as has been pointed out by one of our colleagues,proceed either by  means of addition  or by means  of  subtraction.  The method ofaddition resembles more closely that of arbitration, the method of subtraction thatof national jurisdiction.    It may be held that before  a Court of common  law, the Parties are not  part ofthe Court, that  the judges are in another category, that they  have  been chosen by virtue of special consideration for their own personality, their authority and theircompetence.   But  the Committee of Jurists  considered that it might be useful tokeep in the tribunal someone well acquainted with certain of the exceptional features of the national constitution  of which the non-national judges might not be awareand that there might exist certain national susceptibilities  which from the point ofview of the judged authority  it might be important to take into account, that publicopinion might be mistrustful if it knew that a dispute  in which it was&quot; interestedwas being decided exclusively by judges belonging  to  foreign nations.    The conditions of  equality and  of  justice being  attained equally in the twosystems, it appeared to us unnecessary to substitute, for purely theoretical reasons,a new system for  that proposed unanimously by  The Hague Jurists.            5. Relations between the  Court and the League of Nations.    The question  has been raised  whether the League  of Nations as such or itsorganisations should be allowed to plead before the Court in order  to present con-elusions or to lay  stress upon certain points of view which  might appear to themto be  in  conformity with the general interest.    The essential principle which must  be  safeguarded is  that of the respectiveindependence of the judicial powers  represented  by  the  Court and of the inter-national power represented by the Council of the  League of Nations.  Each of thesetwo powers has  its own domain.  The powers of the Council and of the Assemblyare such that they extend to the transformation of the composition of the Courtitself, but when they have fully exercised their rights  by establishing internationaljurisdiction under, conditions determined  by them it is important for them to allow the latter independence in its judgments.  We will thus answer in the negative thequestion which was put to us on this point.                           6. Position of the Judges.    Article 29 leaves to the  Council  the task of fixing  the salaries of the  Judges.Two systems have been proposed to the Council.  On the one hand it has been held that it was necessary to ensure high salaries to the Judges not only so as to guaranteetheir absolute independence and to give them a particular authority in the eyes ofther world but also to allow the  choice of Judges to be made from among the  mosteminent men holding  doubtless in their own  country either very important posts orposts which are highly paid.  Certain incompatibilities with regard to this matterare foreseen  in The Hague Scheme.   If a Judge  is obliged to re&apos;sign these duties orthese  posts, the recruiting of these Magistrates would  naturally be more  limited,and it will only be possible to obtain the services of  persons of secondary importance,who will not give the necessary dignity to the Court.    On the other hand, it has  been  pointed out that certain  Judges will  only becalled upon to sit for a very short period, thus allowing  them in certain,  cases tohold their position as Judges of the  Court at the  same time as certain other postswhich are not inconsistent with Article 16.    In any case it appears that a distinction should be made between the president and the Clerk of the Court and the rest of the Judges.  The President and the clerk of the Court are,  by Article  22, obliged to reside on the spot, and it will be under-
stood that the President, even apart from the meetings of the Court, should direct the general  work of this Court, the preparation of cases  which may come up  forjudgment before him, and the supervision of the carrying out of his judgments    An annual salary for the President.and for the Clerk of the  Court thus appears in any case  indispensable,.and the salary of the President must be extremely high,for it is essential that the head of &quot;the international  magistracy should be in aposition of quite indisputable eminence in the world&apos;s  eyes.    As to the Judges,  if attention is to be  given to the  criticisms to which we have just referred it would be possible to divide their salaries into two distinct oarts; togrant them a moderate fixed salary,  and to supplement this by large daily allowancesduring the time when the meetings will nesessitate their presence at The Hague.                                                                             i     .  .     .......        7.. Nomination of Candidates.    In the draft scheme of The Hague Jurists this nomination is to be made by thenational groups of the members of the permanent Court of Arbitration.   CertainGovernments have, however, in the observations which they have  submitted proposedthat the nomination should be made directly by the Governments themselves. ^ It hasin fact been alleged that the appointment by the members of the Court of Arbitrationwould only  be a veiled form  of appointment by  the Government, and that if thenew Court were established, the duties of the old Court would be reduced solely tothe making of these nominations.     These objections can hardly be brought against the system unanimously proposedby The Hague Jurists after detailed study  and very long discussions.   The essentialobject of The Hague Jurists has been to free the nomination of the judges from thepolitical interests of the different countries.  Moreover, it must not be forgotten that,as a general rule, each  country has the right to nominate not only its own subjects,but also judges belonging  to  other countries.  Thus, as Mr. Root has observed, itwould be difficult in  certain cases  for a Government to make sure of an  election.The special competence of  members of the Court of Arbitration,  on the contrary,makes possible a solution genuinely in conformity with the essential idea of  thislofty iurisdiction.     These remarks appear to allow  the  system presented. by  the  Committee ofJurists to be  maintained  in its entirety.                         8. The Right of Intervention.     The observations in the draft  project of The Hague  by one of our  Colleaguesdraw  attention to the following  case: it might happen that a case  appearingunimportant in itself might be submitted to the jurisdiction of  the Court, and  thatthe.Court might  take  a  decision on  this case laying down certain principles ofinternational law:, which, if they were applied to other countries, would  completelymodify  the principles  of  the traditional  law  of this  country, and which  might therefore have serious consequences.  The question has been raised whether in viewof such an  alternative, the States  not involved in the dispute  should not  be giventhe right of intervening in the case in the interest of  the harmonious developmentof the law, and otherwise  after the  closure  of the  case, to  exercise, in the sameinterest, influence on the  future development  of law.  Such action on the part  of anon-litigant State would moreover have the advantage of drawing attention to thedifficulty oif making certain  States accept such and  such a  new development ofjurisprudence,                                                          -     These considerations undoubtedly contain elements of great value.  The HagueJurists have not moreover  disregarded the necessity of bearing in mind considera-tions which, if not exactly  identical, are at least in the same order of ideas.   Theyhave,  indeed, given to non-litigant  States the  right to intervene in a case where any interest of a judicial nature which may concern them is involved.     Moreover, Article 61 of the Draft lays down that:  &apos;&apos; Whenever the constructionof a convention in which States other than those concerned in the case are parties,is in question, the Registrar shall notify all. such States forthwith.  Every State sonotified has the right to. intervene  in the proceedings:  but if it uses this right, theconstruction given by the judgment will be as binding  upon it as upon the originalparties to the dispute.&quot; This last  stipulation establishes, in the contrary case,-thatif a State  has not intervened in  the case the interpretation cannot be  enforcedagainst it.                                                        , ,     .  ,; ;
o    No possible disadvantage could ensue from  stating directly what Article  61indirectly admits.   The addition of an Article drawn up as follows  can thus  be proposed to the Assembly ;    The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties andin respect of that particular case.    The observation presented had,  however, a much wider bearing:  the questionof giving to the various legal systems represented by the various States the possibilityof collaborating with the Court  in the development of international law.   It must first of all be noted that the Court  will contain representatives of the  differentjudicial systems into which the world is divided and that the judgments of theCourt will therefore be the result of  the co-operation  of entirely different thought and systems.    Need we go further ?    The draft scheme of The Hague gives dissenting judges the right to state their opposition or their reservation without recording their reasons.   If these judgeswere permitted to  state their opinions together with their reasons, the play of thedifferent judicial lines of thought would appear  clearly.    If the assent of the Council were obtained for this view, it would be  sufficientto alter the text of Article  56  as follows:    &quot; Judges who  do not concur in all or part of the judgment of the Court maydeliver a separate opinion.&quot;    The question of the language of the Court, which has been also raised will bedealt with in a separate report.    Such, Gentlemen,  are  the observations which  had  to be presented  for your consideration on the genuinely important questions which have been raised by thevarious Governments with  regard to The Hague  draft.  Your Rapporteur has notbeen able to append the detailed discussion of the modifications in drafting  proposedin various quarters for certain Articles of this draft.  As I said at the beginning ofmy Report, we are not an Assembly of jurists competent to correct in detail thework  of the most  eminent jurisconsults  who  composed your Hague  Committee.These are only the general views of  the Council of the League of Nations whichshould be made known and considered in connection with the proposed text.  Buttaking the text as a whole,  I think that we have a duty to fulfil towards the Juristsof The  Hague, which is to adopt it as our own, and  to propose it  in its entiretysubject to certain modifications which I have already noted, for the consideration ofthe General Assembly of Geneva.  The last word will be left for the  States thererepresented, but it is our  duty  not  to weaken the lofty significance of the draftdrawn up with so much competence and  care by our  Committee of  Jurists,  byhesitating to  adopt this important and maturely considered work.    It will be the duty of the  General Assembly to draw up the terms of the future international Convention which is to be submitted for the signature of the  Membersof the League of Nations.
