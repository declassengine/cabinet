All classes appear to havebeen profoundly touched and some of the spirit that animatedthe people in the early years of the war has been re-born.As usual, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; misread its readers, and, inridiculing the commemoration, committed a blunder which itwill take some time to live down.     At the instigation of Moscow, through the TradingDelegation, the Labour Press is trying to infuse life intothe moribund Councils of Action to force the hands of theGovernment,   Wording men in North London expect that there-ope:oixg of trade will bring a large number of Bolshevikagitators,  camouflaged as traders.  Some deprecate this, butthe majorxty Icojfc forward to it.     The effect cf the recent arrests is becoming apparent.Extremist speakers arc more guarded and there is a declinein attendances at ievolutionary meetings.     There  are signs that moderate Labour leaders may bereplaced one by one by extremists.
STIPE DAY;      The extraordinary manifestation of public sentiment in connection with the interment of the unknown soldier on Armistice Day has&apos; surprised everyone.  Though traffic has been readmitted to Whitehall the queue is nearly as large as ever.  The, result has been the re-birth of national solidarity which has not been, apparent -since the early crises of the War.      The people have been profoundly touched by the  homage paid by the Royal Family to;an unknown subject and the absence of class distinction in the distribution of  seats,&apos; and this feeling was strikingly illustrated when the Queen visited the New Theatre on November 12th.   It was quite obvious to onlookers that the people were  taking that opportunity of expressing their gratitude.  Many thousands of people have come from all parts of the  country end havewaited hours to pay reverence to the Cenotaph and to the Tomb.      It was left to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,, with its extraordinary obtuseness to the real feelings of the public,, for whom it pretends to cater, to pour ridicule upon the ceremonial.  It provoked so many angry protests from its readers that on the following day it had entirely to change its tone.  Even Major Gillespie revolted agsinst the soandalous letter written by Francis Meynell.  The staff of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, which tried to brea  the solemn Silenoe, was raided by an angry crowd from Pleet Street,  which used them rather roughly.   All the efforts of the extremists  to represent the commemoration as &quot;dope&quot;,&quot;exploitation  of the dead&quot;,  and &quot;Government propaganda&quot; have recoiled upon thepersons who were mean enough to coin the phrases.                                                 THE/
1TO COUNCILS OF ACTION     Owing to pressure from Moscow in connection with the  (latest Bolshevik &quot;ultimatum&quot;, the &quot;full text&quot; of which appealin the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of November 16th, and to the march ofevents in the Crimea, the councils of action are being stirreup by that paper.  The National Council, according to thesame source, is being pressed to convene a national conference     A manifosto issued by the National Council on November16th declares that:          &quot;The National Council of Action, after a necessary     suspension of activities due to the miners&apos; strike and     other causes, has decided to re-open the fight with the     Government to secure Peace and Trade with Russia ...          &quot;British Imperialism dominates the position and     the reactionary influences inside the Cabinet are     preventing the resumption of trading relations with     itussia.  We not only want trade with Russia, we want     Peace ...          &quot;Peace with Russia would increase employment and     bring down prices ...          &quot;We cannot allow political Imperialism or the     interests of our international financiers to stand     in our way.  The workers should not starve to promote     inflated prices or to perpetuate artificial bank rates.          &quot;Work for the workless:          &quot;Peace for the people:          &quot;Pree trade with Russia.          &quot;To promote these three objects local councils     of action should get busy.          &quot;Organise Spocial Meetings.          &quot;Bombard your members of Parliament with             resolutions.          &quot;Distribute literature.          &quot;The National Council is prepared to supply     local councils with quantities of leaflets for free     distribution dealing with trade with Russia in     relation to unemployment and the cost of living.          &quot;Promote a trade and Peace with Russia&apos;  campaign     in your district,  and send for quantities of free     literature to the above address.  Supplies free and     postage paid.&quot;     It seems clear that the extremists would not welcome                                                   the/
     the departure of the Russian Trade Delegation, which hasm   meant so much financial support for them.   The &quot;Dailyt     Herald&quot; has waxed emphatic in its anxiety;  the Labour     Press campaign is known to be inspired by Moscow,    Robert3     Williams, whose relations with the Bolshevik regime are     apparently closer than those of any other Labour leader, is       taking an active part in the campaign.          The Cardiff Trades and Labour Council is requesting     the National Council of Action, through the Trades Union     Congress, to move on behalf of Ireland.   It has also proposed     that the Labour Party should set up a new council to deal     solely with the question of Ireland; the local council of action     is being urged to prevent the export of iron and steel from     South wales to Belfast.          It is stated that the Glasgow council of action is     enquiring into an allegation that a Renfrew firm is working on     a larre contract for gee shells.PEE C01MJNISTS     On November 14th the Liverpool Communist and iSinn Feinparties held a. meeting which was attended by about 800 people.The speakers included Deckle of Glasgow, Sean D. Cairns and the rev. Gibson of Belfast;  Cathal 0&apos;Shannon and Gallagher wereunaole to be present.   The most inflammatory remarks weremade by Leckie who said:          &quot;Parliamentary action is no good at all.  The     Government believes in force.    It believes it can   -  subdue the Irish nation by force.  The murder gang is     being broken up. by force, saysDloyd George.  Then how     can it be wrong for the Irish to use force?  How can it     be wrong for you to use force?  In Greenock we have     prevented munitions of war being shipped to Ireland.  If     munitions can be made we ought to take care that instead     of them being used to put down revolution in Ireland,     they are kept for another kind of revolution - when the     time comes.   If you don&apos;t force your Government to     stop this murder the same methods that are. being applied     to Ireland will be applied to you sooner or later.&quot;   Sinn     Fein and Communism will smash up the British limp ire, so, I     say, &apos;Up Irishmen; Up the Irish&apos;Republic&apos;  and in conclusion     &apos;Workers of the World unite&apos;.&quot;  ;Generally/
          Generally speaking, comnranist speeches have &quot;been     pitched in a minor key sinoe the recent arrests; there seems     little prospect, at present, of a united party and the     existing English groups do not appear to increase their     strength.   In Cardiff, for instance, there are only about     30 active members and their classes are attended by not more     than a doaen men and youths.   In Scotland the communist     group seems to be making some headway at the expense of the     Independent Labour Party.LONGUSTIS VISIT TO ENGLAND          It is reported that one of the principal objects of     Longuet&apos;s recent visit to England was to induce the Council     of Aotion to persuade Krassin and Riazwioff to use their     influence to obtain, through the Executive Committee of the     Third International, a modification of Moscow&apos;s attitude to     England and Prance.   Longuet met only Xrassin who stated that     although his economic policy had been eventually recognised by     Moscow, he was powerless to influence the external politics     of the Soviet Government.    He advised Longuet to get the     motions he considered necessary voted by socialist congresses.              now          It is/announced that modifications are to be made in     Articles 7, 20 and 21 of the famous 21 conditions of the     Third International, specially to meet Longuefs views,     provided that he and his followers are admitted to the Party. IELIi-INATION OP MODERATE LEADERS          The extremist onslaught on moderate trade union leaders 1     appears to be bearing fruit and there are indications that     &apos; *                        -                       1 &apos; &apos;. &apos;         &apos; \     the  saner men are weary of being baited:  the immediate     examples are Messrs. Brace and Hartshorn.   James Winstone is I     to be offered the presidency of the South Wales Miners1     Federation, while Noah Ablett will represent Merthyr on the     executive council.   Both  these men are pronounced extremists     Hartshorn has been violently attacked by A.J. Cook,and     Edwin Jenkins,  president of the Nantymoel Lodge,  has only                                                           been/
     been allowed to retain his position until the end of the year     when a ballot will be taken.          Herbert Smith, of the Yorkshire Hiners1  Association, is     considering his resignation, as are some of his lieutenants.          There is a risk that the machinery of trade unionism     will pass more and more into the hands of the Reds.TH5 INTERNATIONAL UNION Off EX-SSHVIOS W,.t..............*....... i i mmm.......in........  mm..........n i..... -p.. i.............n. n.................,          In common with other extremists, members of the International     Union of Ss-Service Hen are much perturbed by the arrest of     their speakers.    Jack Tanner wrote recently  to James 0ox;&quot;The     authorities are  going to be much more active  in regard to the     Reds,  they have  a new method...They are going to arrest persons     on  the ground that their speeches are likely  to incite the     crowd, probably  they will have  some chaps in  the crowd to shout     out that they will do some desperate act...The Magistrate,..     will bind the speaker over in a very heavy sum, make him find     sureties and if  he cannot or will not, then he goes  to jail,     not for the seeech, but for not finding surety.   The thing is     not what you say but how the audience receives it.    I hope     you will out your chaps quietly on  their guard.&quot;          Activity among ex-service  men  in the London area continues     and Macdonald is working hard at Tottenham to organise another     demonstration &quot;to get their own back&quot; on the  police  for the     last &quot;attack on  the workers&quot;.   He  intends that such a     demonstration shall not be a peaceable procession but an     organised body,  able and disciplined to hold  its own.         Ten ex-soldiers with their families are  reported to have     occupied empty houses at Southampton and have so f$,r maintained     possession.          In spite of strenuous propaganda to put  the Tyneside     branohes of the  National Union  of 2x-Service  Men on  a firm     basis  the campaign has,  as yet,  met with little success  and                                                               the/
      the  meetings  are  poorly  attended. C.  L.  I.UL0NE,  M..J?.           On November  12th  Llalone was charged  at  Bow  Street  under      Regulation 42  of  the Defence of  the  Realm Act, with attempting      to cause  sedition and  disaffection among  the  civilian populate     Be was remanded until  November 19th.           It has now been ascertained that the Red Army manual     attached  to Report Ho. 79 was  typed  on an Underwood machine     which was  found in ilalone&apos;s locked office, of which he  only     had  the key; and  that  therefore  he committed  perjury when he     said at the Police Court that  he had never seen  the document     before.    Further, a number of copies of  the  document were     deposited  in cloak-rooms by a  woman, believed to be Miss     Gilbertson, and the tickets were posted without  covering     letter to  l-ialone  himself.   The  typewriter itself is the     property  of the Ministry of Munitions and he  has no title to i!     There is also  evidence to show that Malone \;-as constantly in t)     company of Veltheim, the Bolshevik courier, whom he swore he     did not know.   Re was in possession of loaded revolvers for     which he has no permit.   There  are, however, difficulties in     procuring  sufficient evidence to charge him with perjury, but     it is hoped that these matters can be mentioned at the trial     and that he can be charged with  illegal possession of loaded     firearms.TOM QU5L0H          It is resorted that Tom Queloh, who has been in Russia     for some months on behalf of British communist organisations,!     has received instruction from the  Third International in regel     to the promotion of disturbances and of &apos;&apos;terror f informs suil     to British conditions.   The National Onion of Railwayman and     Transport  Workers&apos; federation are said to have refused a     request from Moscow to pledge themselves to a political striJj     whenever this is demanded of them.                                             THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;/
*&quot;149        Strenuous efforts are being raad.e by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to   whip  up  Trade  Union support for the  Northern edition;   there is   as  yet,  however, no evidence of financial as distinct  from verbal   support.   It  was  stated at a recent London  meeting of the   Railway  clerks  Association that not 50$ of  the  members read the   paper and that as  the  union opposed  the  acceptance  of  Bolshevik   money, it was  logically bound to help in the provision of some   alternative.    The meeting was specially convened to pass a vote   of  censure on  the  executive committee for investing in the   &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.  &quot;        Wholesale newsagents doubt the  accuracy of  the &quot;Daily   Herald&quot;  &quot;net sale&quot; figures.   They say that  the  returns are very   heavy and estimate that the drop in  circulation,  since the   price of the paper was,raised, is 40$.        The incessant attacks on the &quot;capitalist&apos;&apos; Press by   extremist speakers and Labour papers are beginning  to  take   effect and a great many workers distrust almost  anything they   read.. -It is.,said  that they merely read  the  racing  news and then ..  throw, away their papers.  :[ ,        As  indicated  in a former report,  further evidence has been \. received, that  Sdgar Lansbury is disposing, of die&amp;ends  Valued at r many  hundred.thousands of pounds in  deals of from  20,000 to ,;^ 30,000  at .,a:time.  It is&apos;believed that  evidence, will  shortly be, forthcoming.;showing, that this money;  is ,going.to  the &quot;Daily   Herald&quot;y;and it  is on  t-hie-^ no,doubt,  that,the. proposal to found   a Manchester. edition..of;the paper is -based.,&apos; * ,pig .EBIJ9  III ;CrR^AT Ij RITA III .-   &apos;,.7          Qn November (14th the  Vvomen&apos;s  International  League held a    mee^ing^in  the Ilirgsway Hall  at which lantern slides intended to    refute  the  assertion that  there had been no  reprisals were shown.m  &quot;DAILY  HERALD&quot;
A  resolution was passed -calling upon the Government to convene a  representative and unfettered Irish Assembly and the sum of 57 was  collected from an audience of about 500.              (     Dr. Mannix was staying at Harrogate last week and received a number of visitors.   He addressed a large meetingat Deeds on November 18th; some 5,000 people assembled to greethim on arrival.   He spoke to an audience of about 4,000 at,Bradford on November 14th, but on neither occasion were his remarks worth repetition.  His visits were apparently ignored  Iby all but the Irish element.    On November 14th Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington delivered herusual speech at Rebburn-on-Tyne to about 1,200 of theconverted, and at Newcastle to some 2,000.   These meetingswere hell under the auspices of the Women&apos;s InternationalLeague which seems temporarily to have adopted Ireland as the \chief plank in its platform.                                   j                                                             i I     The following interesting account  of drilling in the     ISinn Fein Hall at Bridgton,  Glasgow,  on November 7th,  has keen!received:          &quot;The Hall was opened at  1 p.m. j several men     entered and shortly afterwards the officer in oharge     gave the order to fall  in.    The men were called to     attention and then told  to  stand at ease.    The roll    [     was called, and about 30 non-oommissioned officers  and     men answered to their names.   The  following orders  were  I     given:                                                   [        No.l section would parade  on  Monday nights.           t        No.8 section would parade  on  Tuesday nights.          [        Engineering section and  all N.C.0&apos;s would parade     I                                     on Wednesday nights.    (        No.3 section would parade  on  Thursday nights.         i        No.4 section would parade  on  Friday nights at        I                                     7-30 each night.        I        The  whole parade to muster here on Sunday, 14th  inst.I     Any men failing to attend would  be fined,  and all men    I     present were to inform abBent  members  to attend parades.I     They were  asked if  any man  had not  a card  to prove,      I     meaning to hold out  their hand,  also that  if any man or  1     men was apprehended  there would  be  so  many sent to      flff     swear that he  or  they were  not there at the  time.    All  j     N.C.0&apos;8 were told  to  remain after  the  parade.  The parade!     was  then dismissed at 5.15  p.m.  and told to  salute.&quot;    IIRELAND/
     There  is again  practically no  chenge to record, in thedisturbed state  of Ireland.    In the majority of cases wherethe police  have  been ambushed. and-ettaolced they have beatenoff the attacks, inflicted casualties onrtbe enemy -end capturedprisoners.    19  arrests have been made in connection withthese  outrages.     A very important seizure of documents was made onNovember 16th.   It comprised, among many Staff Orders, completeplans  for the  blowing up of Liverpool Docks and a power station in  Manchester, and also a scheme for infecting Britishtroops with the  bacillus of typhoid through their milk andinfecting Army horses with glanders through the oats.    the possession  of  these  documents by the Government may prove to bethe death blow to the murder gang in Ireland.  .     The total number of outrages recorded, 200, again shows a slight decrease especially under the heading &quot;attacks onpolice1&apos;; this  fact is no doubt due to reaction after the campaign of revenge  for the deaths of McSwiney and Kavin Barryand to the pressure  maintained by the Crown forces.     Of the total number of outrages 131 were directlyattributable to  Sinn Pein, 3 were agrarian in origin and 60were of a serious nature without political or agrarian motivebut indicative of grave disorder throughout the country.   5police were murdered, 11 civilians &quot;arrested&quot; by Sinn Pein, 1police barrack was attacked, and 3 vacated barracks and 1courthouse destroyed.     &quot;young Ireland&quot; appeared &quot;in 4 page dress instead of an page one&quot; as a consequence of the dismantling of the printing works of Mr. Patrick Mahon of Yarnhall Street, Dublin,which was raided by armed English forces.   This paper has a leading article on &quot;Ireland^ victory&apos; hailing the election                                                         of/
 of Senator Harding to the Presidency of the United States of America, as the destruction of the &quot;fraudulent&quot; League of Katie]&apos; It also contains an article on &quot;Prance and Ireland&quot; by M..M. (presumably Mo White) consisting of extracts from the French Pre eulogising Lord Mayor HoSwiney.   A reference is also made to the impending stoppage of the railways in Ireland in which it i stated &apos;!The people of Ireland must realise at once the fact the it is now the considered plan of English policy to blockade the country and endeavour by starving the women and children to bre the men1s morale...The directorates of the Irish Railways owe a debt to the: community...If they fail to discharge that duty - if they align themselves with the Government in its efforts to starve the people of Ireland - they will share in the guilt of England as her accessory.&quot;      ,             .      There.is no change in the Labour situation beyond the fact that there are signs of nervousness on tho part of the leaders as to the results of the railway stoppage. -  Railway employees continue to be discharged for refusing to work trains conveying Crown forces.    There has been a brisk increase of orders from Provincial merchants on wholesale firms in Lublin in anticipati of the railway trouble.    &apos;&apos; On the whole the outlook is growing brighter and it. is thought &apos;that the back of the Sinn Fein movement is being bent and it only requires continued pressure and firmness to break it altogether.    That this fact is becoming apparent to the people is evidenced by the large increase in reliable information v/hich is being supplied.      The  police and military continue, their activity with excellent results in the capture of irsoort&amp;nt documents, and thej arrests of important  members of the Irish Republican Army.,
