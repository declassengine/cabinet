and by&apos;deceiving  the army as to the true reason of the mobilisation^Zo   Bulgaria, as  soon as it had the means of so doing, severedall the  ties binding it  to the past; at the present hour it hasa firm  and stable  Government that has been able to strengthen the Bulgarian State and  to repress any signs of anarchy in thecountry.  Since the armistice, Bulgaria has given many proofsof the  perfect correction of its attitude and of its loyaltytowards  the Powers of the Entente,     Bulgaria will observe the same loyal attitude in regard tiithe obligations it has assumed.  It is ready to give effectiveguarantees of its  intention of fulfilling its international obligations and of accepting such regulations as may be prescribed by the  jeague, concerning its military, naval and air forces and armaments*           .3o   Having obliterated  all memories of the past, the Bulgariaof today will endeavour  to realise a state of perfect friendship with its neighbours; its policy being definitely directed towardsthat of the Powers of the Entente, the Bulgarian Government isfirmly  resolved to give  them all its assistance, however slightit may  be, so as to enable them to restore order and trancjuilityin all  countries^  -     In view of those considerations, Bulgaria hopes that inregard  to its admission  to the League, it will not ba^compared to other defeated nations; but that it will.be allowed to prove the sincerity of its intentions in contributing by its work tothe re-establishment of peace in EuropeB                      ,     Trusting that in this matter of vital importance for my country I may rely upon the precious support of Your 1&apos;xcellency,I have the honour of requesting lour Excellency to accept the assurance of my very high consideration^,                    A^STAKBCLUSILI,                            ,                       Prime Minister of  Bulgaria.
