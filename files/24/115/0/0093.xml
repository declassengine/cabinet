                       SUMMARY.RUSSIA.   The Supreme Soviet Industrial bodies realise that foreign capital and management are essential to the existence of the Soviet Government, andthe whole feeling in Government circles in Moscow is that a Communisticstate cannot exist alone.  The re-opening of trade with foreign countries was considered by high Soviet officials as equivalent  to  the  opening ofavenues for Communist propaganda.  The  Delegation  in  England isreliably reported to have received instructions that negotiations regardingcontracts are to be politely spun out as long as possible to no conclusion.The annihilation of the army of General  Wrangel and the junction of theBolshevik and Turkish forces  across Armenia  are factors of  the  utmost importance to the Communists.   Among leaders in Moscow it is  a serious question whether the SovietGovernment will he able to maintain its hold over the country throughoutthe winter.  The policy of &quot; collecting &quot; gold and jewels  continues.   There appears to be  no immediate prospect of a  serious revolt againstthe present regime, and  even persons strongly opposed to it are reportedto have lost all hope of violent intervention.   Siberian peasants have left untilled all hut one-third of  the land theyused to cultivate, and of the mines formerly working only a  few  coalmines are now operating, and  that  on a  very small scale.  In european russia the peasants say  that the revolution must  be saved, meaning thatthey.have got the land and are going to hold it.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.   President Masaryk and his allies  and associates  generally considerthat Republicanism requires a spiritual stronghold, and that  the allianceknown as the little Entente would be its refuge should it be driven outof Russia.   The receut  visit  to Prague  of Mr. J. H. Thomas is believed to have been connected with President Masaryk&apos;s endeavour  to get  into touch  with Labour  Parties  in  Monarchist  countries and obtain  their support for his policy.ITALY.   The  wind has been taken  out of the sails of  the extremists in theSocialist Party, who now realise that a revolution implying the  establish-ment  of a Soviet  Government in Italy is impossible.  A coup cPetat,either by the Duke of Aosta, Garibaldi, or d&apos;Annunzio,  has  been openlydiscussed, but the likelihood of their schemes  materialising seems remote.   The Italian authorities&apos;  desire to trade with Russia has been dampedby the condition of the barley and  wheat received  from that country,from which they conclude that if this is  all the Bolshevists can do whenthey  put their best  foot foremost, the  advantage  of  relations, eitherdiplomatic or commercial, is likely to be  one-sided.   The second chief of Signor GiolittFs Cabinet is reported to haveconfided to  General   Wrangel&apos;s representative in  Paris that Italy had committed an imprudence in entering into relations  with  Soviet Russia,PRANCE.    French sentiment  displays a distinct  tendency  to move to the Right,coupled with the growth of what might also be denoted as Imperialism in french foreign policy both in Central Europe and further East.                                                             A I
  SPAIN.     Extremists in Spain have, been watching the Italian situation closely,  and consider  that  Italy  supplies  a precedent  more suitable  to  their  situation than Soviet Russia.  There is still great uneasiness in labour  circles.  PORTUGAL.     The  situation in Portugal  is more stable.   The Government  have  arrested a number of agitators, and  have called  up the  reserves of two  divisions.  Much of the discontent was due to the bad distribution of  foodstuffs.  NORWAY.     The question of the acceptance of the Moscow conditions for affiliation  to the Third International has  caused a split in the Norwegian Labour  Party, and the Moderate Socialists took the opportunity of attacking the  extremists and beating them.  SWEDEN.     The Swedish extremists appear to stand nearer acceptance of Lenin&apos;s 21 points than those of any other  country except  Italy. DENMARK.    A committee formed of representatives of Danish industry and finance is  to  draw  up a Dano-Russian  commercial  treaty to be submitted  to Krassin. HOLLAND.    The  country  as  a whole remains phlegmatic towards revolutionary propaganda. GERMANY.    There is a marked reaction against iBolshevisrn in Germany.  In the Ruhr district the difference between  the mental and political  atmosphere now and in the spring of the year  is remarkable. SWITZERLAND.    Switzerland is in future to be the south-west  European centre for communist propaganda.                      .    The government  has taken up  a position of extreme firmness towards Soviet Russia.  Leniu&apos;s 21 points  are dividing extremists. AUSTRIA.    The Communists have sustained a crushing defeat at  the election for the Austrian National Council, despite frenzied efforts on  the part of the Third International and  a  lavish  expenditure of Russian money.  The reported collaboration of the Hungarian Monarchists with  Monarchists in Bavaria to establish a Monarchy in Austria is confirmed by the Austrian policq. FINLAND,   While the conclusion  of peace is welcomed by large traders  the population as a whole fears that  the wholesale clearance of stocks of provisions to  Russia,  entails  a shortage of supplies and a further rise inprices......:.........     .   -                         .  . :-i.r.\
                               ;4ABALTIC  STATES.       Esthonia.   Bankruptcy appears inevitable, and many Esthonians fear that a return of some sort or other to Russia is called for.POLAND.   The financial  situation is lamentable.  The creation of a  Galiciaindependent of Poland appeals to Germany for reasons  connected with what she regards  as the irredentism of that province, and to Russia onaccount of the  weakening of Poland itself.GREECE.,  M.  Venizelos&apos;8 defeat has  created a situation of  the  utmost gravityboth for Greece herself and for Entente policy in the near East. Thereis no indication of important Bolshevik agitation in Greece.BULGARIA.   M.  Stambolisky&apos;s agrarian government, while increasing its hold uponthe villages, has earned the distrust of business men.  The result of  his visit to England is awaited with much  interest.   Only a  successful issueof his  negotiations there can, it  is thought, lighten  the  many afflictionsunder which Bulgaria is labouring.ROUMANIA.   The general strike declared on 21st October ended in complete failure,due partly to the precipitation of  the railwaymen, who came out beforeother unions, and gave  the  Government an opportunity  of dealing withthem separately.TURKEY.    Italy is reported to be prepared to  give Turkey all the assistance sherequires  for her  material  reinstatement.   The  situation is still full ofperplexity.ARMENIA.    Though the last material obstacle between Turkey  and  Russia  hasbeen swept away, the mutual distrust of the  two parties may  still haveconsequences. AZERBAIJAN.    The  Government is really  controlled by the  local Extraordinary Commission, composed entirely of Russian Bolsheviks. SIBERIA.    The  Japanese have  issued a strongly  worded  note stating  that they cannot recognise the validity of concessions made on behalf of the Far Eastern Republic  to Mr.  Washington  Baker  Vanderlip, whether as representative of a private syndicate or as an emissary of the  American Government. CANADA.     The situation as a whole is steadily improving, and extremists  of the One Big Union are losing heart.
SOUTH AFRICA.   The  spread of  Bolshevik sentiment and  thought among  the nativeshas created  a situation of great menace.   Serious  riots  have beenreported.UNITED  STATES OF  AMERICA.   Labour disturbances  during the month have been officially reported as practically negligible.  Of the 73 disputes recently handled  by theConciliation Board only 11 were strikes and most of the rest ended inagreements between the employers and employed.   The United Communist, an amalgamation of the Communist Party ofAmerica and  the Communist Labour Party,  has secured only one-fourthof the old Communist Party.   A  campaign against all things British is being vigorously prosecuted.
i ^M      ...........  .....*      **- - ......CONFIDENTIAL.  A  Review  of Revolutionary  Movements in                   Foreign Countries.                           PART I.                    1. LATIN COUNTRIES.                            FRANCE.General.   French sentiment displays a distinct tendency to move to the Right.&apos;This  is visible in  the growth of what might almost  be  denoted asImperialism in French foreign policy, both in Central Europe and furtherEast; in M. Millerand&apos;s apparent intention to strengthen and make more,intimate  the  liaison betAveen himself as  chief of  the  State  and thePrefects of the Departments ;  and  in their independence  of  Moscow,proclaimed by the overwhelming majority  of the extremists, to whom1that city was  once little less than a Mecca.The French Socialist Party at Moscow.  &apos; Reports from all quarters confirm previous advices of divided counsels,and of growing hostility  to the  Moscow International  among  FrenchSocialists  of  the extreme Left.  Even M.  Marcel  Cachin&apos;s articles; in&quot;LTIumanite&quot; are  becoming more  tolerant.  He practically disclaimsthe use of force in bringing into being the  Communist International j andsuggests  that  adhesion: to it should depend on temperament, time, andcircumstance.   Both principles  of  action are in flagrant contradiction, tothe policy of Lenin.   To attribute this mildness  to  a change of  heart would,  however, be over-simple.   Its motives are at once shallower and more complex.   the truth  is that  MM. Cachin and  Frossard, AVIIO are  on the spot, see  thatwith  bare hands it  is vain  endeavour  to stem the anti-Bolshevik  tide.Lenin&apos;s21 points and his order to stand  firm may seem simple and feasiblein Moscow.   On the French front they seem  otherwise.  MM. Cachinand Frossard are afraid of being left &quot; in the air.&quot;   To stand stubbornly atthe extreme point of advance is, in a retreat of the whole line, ineffectual-especially  when none will rally to you.   MM.  Cachin and Frossard have  done their  utmost.   They  had returned from Russia with their pockets full of precious stones and their minds of  corresponding enthusiasm  for the cause.  Money had beencoming to  them through Switzerland.   Before the Orleans Congress,theygot into contact with the leaders of the  Anarchist elements, Mayoux andGriraud, whom they induced to endeavour  to  compromise the majorityleaders, especially Jouhaux and Dumoulin, and, of course, Albert Thomas,by  pretending that  these  leaders were doing their best to make thevarious classes work together  in opposition to the principle of direct action, which  had been approved at the Congress of Lyons.   These  tactics failed because  Jouhaux had been informed of the nego-tiations with the Extremists, and was  thus  able to take up a fightingattitude at the Congress towards the detestable spirit that had crept into
 the labour organisations,  by which the adherents of Bolshevism  were demoralising the proletariat  through a  campaign  of  lies and calumnies about labour leaders.  Cachin and Frossard further  state that Merrheim played  a decisive part in the check to Bolshevik ideas at the Congress by producing documents which  he had brought from Scandinavia.  Their report to Moscow finishes with tho statement that the group in the C.G.T. which  is favourably inclined towards Bolshevism is  insignificant.   All the great labour leaders are hostile to Bolshevism, and the minority  have not a single leader of the same standing.    All  this is of unhappy augury for the outcome of the^ French Socialist Congress which is to be held at Tours on December 25th to 31st, and which will  decide  the question of  the  acceptance or  rejection  of  Lenin&apos;s 21 points.    Bolshevik circles in France  apparently  realise that the  fulfilment of their hopes has  again been relegated to a more distant future. They  have fallen back therefore upon  a programme of  Communist education  for the peasants and the proletariat which Sadoul,  Lefebvre,  and  Guilbeaux, acting  on the  instructions  of  the Executive Committee  of the Third International, have prepared for France, and to whose furtherance large sums have been devoted by the  Soviet Authorities. The New Imperialism.    The sense of security in official circles is indicated  by their venturing to  make vital alterations in  the Constitution; in an evident resolve to maintain an active opposition  against  Soviet Russia through Poland, Hungary, and Roumania, even at the risk of a recrudescence of monarchism in Bavaria and Austria ;  and lastly in the endeavours apparently prevalent to make the Islamic world look to Paris as a centre,  and  to impinge upon the prestige of Great Britain in the East.   As regards the first there are indications that, in the forthcoming sitting of Parliament, the  Government will introduce certain alterations in the Constitution which will allow the President of the Republic to take a more important  part  in internal politics.  Rumours are  even current that M. Millerand  intends  for the future to nominate the Prefects himself, and to alter their title to that of Governor of their Departments a measure which would initiate all  over France   an irradiation of the Presidential influence milder, but not   less direct, than that of the Roi Soleil.    It is reported that the Bureau dTnformation Islamique in Paris  is of opinion  that the election of M. Millerand to  the Presidency may result in a rapprochement between France and the Turkish Government or  even the party of Mustapha Kemal.  The founding in Paris of a Mosque and Muslim College  is contemplated, and the  impression seems to be gaining ground  that, so  far as the  Near East is  concerned, the French are more tactfully adopting a policy in its  essence not altogether dissimilar  from that of  Germany before the War.   French  diplomats have  never  under- estimated  the hold of Paris,  and  especially of Montmartre, upon the Europeanised OrientalsThe Confederation Generate du Travail.    There are indications that the C.G.T. is  now inclined  to mould  its policy rather on  that of Milan and Turin than  upon that of Moscow and    *  Count Jean de Lubersac, a Frenchman long employed by the French  Foreign Office in   matters of unofficial politics, has been communicating rather mysteriously with M.  Krassin, with a view to  paying a visit to  Lenin in Moscow.   It is not clear whether he is going on hia own behalf or on behalf of the French Government.  There are  indications  that Count Jean de Lubersac is somewhat  intimately known to M, Krasuin,
                                 TPetrograd.  Though  the seizure  of  tho Italian factories  has hithertoevoked no active imitation in Franco,  it has not been without effect uponthe policy of  the C.G.T.  That body  intends  in future to claim a  share in the control of factories, and to  advocate the creation of distributionoffices for raw material, as demanded by tho Economic Council of Labour.It is also  taking up tho  question of  unemployment.  Trade Unions areto be sent a  questionnaire  concerning the conditions and prospects intheir particular trade,  and the question will  be considered at  the meetingof the National Committee of the&apos; C.G.T. early in November, as will alsothe question of its  attitude concerning Russia, war in general, and  theapplication of the eight-hour day.   The  minority  Congress of  the  C.G-.T. have  organised a  CentralCommission in Paris  from  which departmental committees will receivetheir orders as regards propagation of  revolutionary ideas.   Their efforts,however, are  uulikely to meet with much successful Jouhaux&apos;s position at the head  of  the C.G.T. appears  unshaken.  It  has been  rumouredlately in  political circles that he may  be  nominated  Minister of  Labour.                             BELGIUM.Political and  Economic.    The Cabinet is expected to tender its  resignation shortly on  accountof  the  withdrawal  of the Liberal  Ministers  from the  Government.Pending.the general election it will probably be replaced  by a temporaryMinistry  under M.  Delacroix.  The  result of  the elections  is  very uncertain.  In Flanders at least  there  will be substantial gains for  theSocialists, whose programme for  the. reduction of  military service; to sixmonths, the  control  of prices to reduce  the cost of  living, and  the socialisation of certain industries  is pretty sure to find acceptance.   Theindustrial situation has  improved slightly, though  employers are  veryuneasy at the  continued demands for increased wages occasioned by therise in the cost of living.  Belgian business men have gathered from theInternational Financial Conference in Brussels that  their lot is certainlyno  worse than that of  most Western  European  States.  The clarity,-precision, and  straightforwardness  of  the  statements   of  the british delegates  at the International Financial Conference are reported to  havemade a most  favourable  impression.  The conference, however,  broughtno panacea for the regulation  of rates of  exchange,  which it regarded asimpossible except  according  to the  trade  and  work  of  individual countries.                                                         :. &apos;)The Socialist Party and Extremists.    Despite certain transactions with  the parties of the extreme Left and,through them,  with  the  Third  International, on  the  part of certainprominent International  Socialists, the Socialist Party as a whole appearsfirm in its resolve to maintain its independence of Moscow.   The Partycongress held  in Brussels  at  the beginning of November decided by alarge majority to adhere to tho Second International, and to continue itsparticipation in the government.                               .&quot; -    - -    The  19th  Congress  of  Belgian Trade  Unions which , opened at brussels on the 17th November, while  passing  a  resolution in favour ofthe socialisation of essential industries and services, expressed&apos; its belief in  evolutionary methods,  though  urged  by  Jacquemotte  and  otherextremists that such socialisation could only be brought about by violentrevolution.                                ..      .       &apos;.;. -  ,  ,, . &quot;
    The recrudescence of Bolshevik  propaganda in Belgium, obviouslyintended to prepare the way for economic  understanding  with Russia,appears to have official tolerance if  not inspiration, and  the  intervention of M. Vandevolde, the Minister of Justice, in favour of a Russian foundin possession of Bolshevik literature intended  for propaganda purposes,seems to  indicate that  Belgian policy, presumably influenced by thatof England, is tending to such an understanding.    A branch of the Communist Party is reported to have been founded inGhent, to have a considerable number of members, and to be on the eveof publishing its own organ, the &quot; Internationale.&quot;    Further efforts are being made to  promote  revolutionary ideas amongthe  members  of the  Socialist  Federation of ex-Combatants,  whosepresident,  TilJmans,  is  an ardent  Bolshevik.  The annual congress ofthe Federation  at Brussels on 5th October 1920 announced its preference of revolution to war, and said that on the day of mobilisation they would join as conscientious workers in the overthrow of the capitalist regime ;after  which the  question of national defence would  begin to  interestthem.Russian Propaganda.    Basil ChelgounofF, one of the Bolshevik representatives in Belgium,recently returned to Russia in  charge of a  batch of Russian  prisionerswho were to be repatriated ; on his return  to Belgium he was found tobe in possession of a considerable quantity of Bolshevik literature whichwas undoubtedly intended for  propaganda  purposes.  The whole matter has, however, been kept secret at the  special request of  the Minister ofJustice,  M.  Vandevolde, who  is  himself  a  prominent  InternationalSocialist.    There are indications that the Belgian authorities are becoming some-what alarmed by the number of Russian  refugees at present residing inthe  country.   Many  of these  individuals  are  frankly Bolshevik  in sympathy, and  have organised  meetings  in various large towns, such asBrussels, Liege, and Antwerp,  where they propagate their revolutionaryideas.                               ITALY.General.    The  wind  has been taken out  of the sails  of the extremists inthe Socialist Party,  who now  realise that a revolution implying theestablishment of  a  Soviet Government in Italy is impossible.  They cannot  longer  count  on the organisations or the masses.  Vodovosov, theSoviet representative  in  Italy, has  himself lost all hope  of  bolshevisingthat  country.  The  arrest of  Malatesta  and  other  leading anarchistshas1 averted  the possibility of  explosive disorders for the time  being.Vodosovov is  in  close touch  with Giulietti,  the  prime mover  of theItalian  Red  Merchant  Marine at  Genoa and  president of the Sailors&apos;Federation in Italy, through whom  he has been able to get several ships with  war  material  for  Wrangel  held up.   On  the  other hand, theeconomic  policy  of Giolitti has failed, and his Cabinet is likely to beRhort-li^ed.  Though the menace of  Bolshevism is  no longer imminenteconomic  conditions  have grown  worse.   An attempt to proclaim  arepubKe is not impossible, in which  case Nationalists and Reactionariesimf try to step in to save  the monarchy.  A coup oVetat, either by theBtfke of Aostat, Garibaldi,- or d&apos;Annunzio, has  been openly discussed, butthe likelihood of their schemes materialising seems remote.    -     -
The Seizure o! the Factories.   The  situation during the  last  few  weeks  may  be described asabounding  in  elements  both grotesque  and tragic, so  nicely balancedthat it  is not  possible  to discriminate which will preponderate,  thoughpossibly counsels of moderation  will  prevail.   While  in  Russia theGovernment calls the tune  and the  masses dance, in  Italy the reverseis the case the unions call tho  tune  and the Government retire grace-fully into the background and take no steps to protect either their owner even private property.   The  workers sewed  the factories,  beginning with the metal  works,and, extending  their activities  later to other concerns, claimed  to becarrying on production at a  normal  rate, even  working overtime.  Bythreats  they retained a number of technical employes, but by no meansenough of these essential members of the  community.   Hence, in spiteof the  apparent activity of  the  factories, the  clanging of tools, thebuzzing  of machinery, and the lavish  display of electric light, all thatresults is a tremendous waste of raw material, stores, and coal, which is,incidentally, extraordinarily scarce.   The behaviour of the would-be anti-militarist Communists is  weirdin the extreme.   During  the war the majority of workers in industrial centres were bitterly anti-militarist.  Now, however,  they have createdamongst themselves  a more  complicated military machine than even theGovernments during the war.   Arms,  ammunition,  bombs,  aeroplanes   they possess- all  these.Machine guns have been mounted  on the roofs of factories, searchlightsplay in the sky, and of  course  red  flags are  flying from all chimneys.Sentinels are  regularly drilled, and, armed  to the teeth, smartly presentarms to the labour &quot; brass hats,&quot; and, in  a word,  the workers are  in themidst of &quot; the pomp and  circumstance of glorious  war &quot; which they latelyso bitterly condemned.   Regular troops are powerless.  Two companies of the Guardia Regiawere surrounded by rioters, who tried to disarm them, and some  of thesoldiers who, in self-defence, fired  their rifles, were punished by imprison-ment.   The economic loss to the country, already financially in extremis,is, of course, enormous.   Italy, of  all countries, is the  last which shouldhave   attempted the  Communist experiment,   and  should  have beendeterred by the example of Russia.  There  can be no question that thesescenes are the result of  years of political pandering  to  the subversives,and  are also partially due to the wholesale washing of dirty  linen  in public when the inquiry into the conduct of the war took place.   At the same time no real revolution is to be feared.   This occupationOf the factories, with its accompanying paraphernalia of pseudo-military organisation, may be considered merely theatrical manifestation, on a parwith that national love of display which appeals to the Italian soul.   Meanwhile a bill is to be announced to reform the  Supreme LabourCouncil and create  a Technical Council, appointed equally by employersand workers.   One section  of the Council  will  deal with commerce andindustry  and  the  other with agriculture.   The new  body,  besidesadjudicating  on  questions  involving the relations  of employer andemployed, will have both legislative and consultative powers regardingdisciplinary measures and working conditions in factories.   S. G-iolitti&apos;policy has  not received universal  acceptance.   It  is  true  that by itrevolutionary tendencies  have  been made to  fight the air, and that theyare from the  social  standpoint no  longer popular, but the economicsituation is  extremely serious  and  gives  the extremists many  oppofr
 tunities, which  they exploit by aid of considerable funds received from Moscow. Relations  with Soviet Russia.    It was  the  intention  of the Italians during September to come  to terms with the Bolsheviks.   Contrary influences have  now  been brought to  bear  upon the country,  however,  by France and  America, and the modifications  of British policy have acted  in the same  sense.  At the Aix  Conference Giolitti is reported to have given  au  assurance, not included in the  official  minutes of  the Conference, that his Government would not recognise the Government of Soviet  Russia.   The Italian authorities&apos; desire to trade  with Russia  has no doubt been damped by the condition of the wheat and barley  which they have received from that country.   They doubtless  conclude that if this is  all  the  Bolsheviks can do when they put their  best foot foremost, the advantage of relations, either diplomatic or  commercial, is likely to  be one-sided.  .  There  are, in fact,  signs that  the Italian  Government has realised that  it has gone too  far in its policy  of  rapprochement with Russia&apos;. Count  Sfonta,  the  Italian  Minister  for Foreign  Affairs,  who was so forward  to greet Krassin on his arrival in England, has refused to permit Litvinoff to enter Italy, and  has stated that Vorovski is no longer persona grata.   In  doing  so he  also  announced that LitvinofTs  intermeddling with internal Bolsheviks in  Scandinavia  and attempts to foment revolu- tionary troubles were now of public notoriety, and  that Vorovski&apos;s extra territorial  privileges  must be limited  in  consequence.    The Italian change of mind  had  unpleasant consequences  for Losovsky, the head of the Russian Soviet Trade  Union  Delegation, whose progress through Europe  appears to be  none  of  the  smoothest.    Refused entry to England, he  subsequently  went to Germany, and  now, following his expulsion from Germany,  comes the refusal  of his entry into Italy.  The Soviet authorities have  been forced  to take refuge in threats of  reprisals against Italian  Consular  agents or representatives  who  may apply to come to  Russia.    Cavalier  Gaspardi, the  second  chief of  Signor  Giolitti&apos;s  Cabinet, recently visited  General Wraugel&apos;s representative in Paris, to whom he explained  that  ill-informed Italy had  committed an  imprudence  in entering into relations with  Soviet Russia, but that the political intrigues of England had forced  her  into that false  position.  He went on  to say that  they now wished   to obtain information  regarding the situation of General wrangel&apos;s  government, and  that  Italy, although  its  Socialist elements favoured a union  with Soviet  Russia, was  not  Bolshevik at heart.  Referring to recent events he said, &quot; We  will let the working &quot; classes have their  owu way in  order to demonstrate  to them that they &quot; cannot do without the bourgeoisie.&quot; j  At the Trieste Congress  Signors Serrati and Daragona gave a woeful account of conditions in Russia, stating that  the destruction of  capitalism-there had been succeeded  by nothing answering to the.most elementary needs of a civilised nation.The Socialist Party.                                              &apos;.-    The Executive Committee  of the Italian Socialist Party decided, by-seven votes to five, to accept Leuin&apos;s 21 points for adherence to the Third International.  Should  this  resolution be ratified by the National Congress of the Party in December its moderate members, like Turati and Daragona, will have to go.  At a  meeting of  the Party at Reggio nell&apos;  Emelia on the 10th October many  of the speeches condemned violent revolution and-the Russian system.
Oriental Intrigues.    The changed attitude of Italy to Soviet Russia lias had its counterpartin a diminution of her  connivance with anti-British  movements in theEast.  The Italian  Government is now on its  guard against complica-tions which might result from its  support of the Turkish Nationalists,more especially on  account of their  connection with the  Bolsheviks.Italian influences at Angora now discourage the whole-hearted acceptanceof  Bolshevism,  and Mustapha  Kemal is asking for  advice as regardslabour matters from the more  moderate section of the Socialist Party in italy.    How far the same effect may be produced upon d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s advocacyof the frocdom of Oppressed People is  not yet clear.   Dr. Said&apos;s Leagueof the Oppressed Nations of the East has  been  working in  close  touchwith the  Italian Government, and  was reported  towards the middle ofSeptember as about to form a branch of d&apos;Aniiunzio&apos;s more comprehensiveLeague of Oppressed Peoples in Fiume.   Under the auspices of Dr. Said&apos;sLeague, a secret treaty drawn up between  Italy and  Albania embodiedan offensive and defensive  alliance between the two countries, the pro-vision  of  arms and  munitions to  enable Albania  to fight  Serbia  and greece, a  secret and  adequate loan on  the part of Italy for raising anarmy of 30,000  Albanians  to fight Greece, and towards the cost  of  avolunteer army of the Malisori tribe for use against Serbia and Montenegro,and  the fostering of revolution  in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It is probablethat the treaty of Rafallo will seriously compromise  d&apos;Annunzio in  this as well as in his other activities.Sicily.    Sicily, Sardinia, and the southern  provinces of Italy have for sometime past, to a certain extent, shared in the neglect on the part of italy of which her former irrondentiyt populations have so bitterly complained.Movements for  regional  self-government,  and  separatist at least  intendency, have been taking place in the  Island of Sicily, as well as lesspronouncedly in  Sardinia and Calabria.   Here as elsewhere Socialists andRepublicans are fanning the flame.  A commission of two Sicilian Mem-bers of Parliament has been formed to bring  pressure to bear upon theGovernment for the improvement of the  Island,  especially as regards theexpediting of  public works, the encouragement of  education, and the strengthening of the criminal law.  One of the conditions put forward isthat money raised by taxation from the Island should be expended on the spot.  Signor Nasi, the ex-Minister and  president for Trapani, is taking a leading part in the  secession movement, doubtless hoping to becomefirst president in the event of a Republic in the Island.    The peasants of Catania and in  the districts near Etna have occupiedlands belonging to the municipality. In no case was opposition offered.                              SPAIN.General.    Extremists in  Spain, as elsewhere in  Western  Europe, have  beenwatching the Italian situation closely,  and  consider that Italy supplies a precedent more  suitable to their  situation than Soviet  Russia.   The&quot; Sindicato Unico&quot; has addressed a communication to the Association of engineers,  asking them, if they are prepared to take over factories, to sendiii the names and special qualifications of the supporters of such action.   There is still great uneasiness in  labour  circles.  Not that  thereis animosity against the monarchy, though the King appears  to have
lost his  power of  mediation  between  the  Right and Left.   He  hastho support of tho  army-, but,  despite  the amount of  work  he getsthrough and his political ability,  the publicity given to the social engage-ments  of the  Court reacts  unfavourably on  his  popularity  with theworkers.  Competent observers  calculate that  if the  Government taketho matter seriously in hand and show unequivocally that they stand for law and ortler the industrial unrest now  prevalent would diminish con-siderably.  Soilor Graupera is convinced that 90 per cent, of the industrial workers in Spain are  conteut, and that the whole Syndicalist movement iabeing organised with  funds received from Moscow a statement confirmed by advices that money for tho  movement in  Barcelona is coming throughfrom Italy.    The union of the two great Labour organisations, the Union general de  Trabajadores  and the Confedcracion  JNacional  de Trabajo,  has not proved so perfect a weapon in  the hands of  the workers as their leadershad hoped, and much co-ordination is still required  before the  branchescan be  at one as regards revolutionary action.  The new Governor ispursuing a policy of lenieucy towards the Syndicalists  and  allows themto meet quite openly.  His restraint, severely criticised by the employers,was probably due to Senor Dato&apos;s desire to  keep things quiet  till  afterthe elections.    The Syndicalist movement is being  run on lines of terrorism, and themen are obliged to  strike and pay  subscriptions  to Syndicalist bodieswhen they want to  do neither.   The Syndicalists,  under Segui, are inclose touch with  the Communist Party  under Layret, and their  common policy results  in lightning strikes all over  the country.  There is eventalk of a revolutionary movement in which the miners are to be concerned,and which is based on the hope that the  military forces will be so dividedup in dealing with sporadic  strikes that when it comes  to  a  head theauthorities will find it difficult to concentrate their  troops in the miningdistricts.  Funds for  this movement are said to have been brought  from moscow by the well-known Syndicalist,  Pestana.  No action on the partof the extremists is contemplated before  the  end of December.Communists.    Fernando  de Los Rios  and Francisco Largo Cabellero have reportedto  the  Central Bolshevik  Committee   at  Stockholm  the  successfulformation of  illegal Communist  organisations in Madrid and Barcelona,which have been placed under the leadership of  convinced and thoroughlytrustworthy comrades.  Negotiations are in progress  for obtaining the adherence of  Spanish anarchists to the  Third  International.  Touch isbeing maintained  with Bolsheviks  in Paris, and Cabellero intends  to visit Cachin in order  to discuss with him certain  points  regarding theconditions of entry into  the Third International.    Cabellero  is being used as a post  box for Bolshevik literature coming to Spain via Stockholm, as it  is believed that  his position as  secretaryto the Spanish Nationalist Party makes him immune from  police inter-ference.   Bolshevik  newspapers  are  being   received  in  Spain  from holland, Russia, and  Scandinavia.  Barcelona  Communists, directed byMarcelino Domingo,  Pestana, and Segui, are reported to be in touch withCommunists in the United Kingdom and  to  have contemplated action inconnection with the miners&apos; strike.Barcelona.    Senor Graupera,  the  president  of  the Employers&apos; Federation inBarcelona, reports that  the  situation in  that town is quieter  than  it has ever been before.   The Governor has avoided any provocation in the way
 of  posting  troops  about the town.   In the event of disturbances  he proposes  to  take strong action, and believes he can rely upon the troops at his disposal to carry out his orders. The Juntas  and the Army.    Uneasiness at the Governments handling of the Labour question and the prevalence of anti-militarism have  renewed activity on the part of the military Juntas, which have  been  holding meetings at  Saragossa and Barcelona.   The  Government  have,  however, persuaded them  to  do nothing  until after  the elections.  Their  anxiety is  justified by  the organised incitements to rebellion among  troops in Saragossa and  the provinces.  A recent raid by the military authorities led to  the discovery of quantities  of seditious printed matter and of correspondence between propaganda agents. Strike in the Rio Tinto.    Some  1,200 workers  in the Rio Tinto had by the end  of October returned to work, and it was thought  probable that more  would  follow their example.  The Spanish members of the staff, who had made common cause with  the strikers, had also expressed their  readiness to  return. Successful or unsuccessful, however, the strike is reported to have been morally damaging to Great Britain, and as likely to entail commercial losses later on.  The manager of  the Rio Tinto Mining Company  is reported to be  exceedingly able,  but harsh and  unscrupulous  in  his  methods, and reports  leave little  doubt  that the men  have been working  under conditions which give them considerable cause for complaint, German Underground Activities.    The arrival of the new German Ambassador in Madrid  is reported to have been the signal for an increase in German Secret  Service activities. In  Barcelona alone  the  annual  sum  of 600,000 to 800,000 pesetas is reported to have been placed at  the disposal of  the Service for agitation. Berlin has given  instructions that  money  should be spent freely  to provoke  dissention between  France  and   Spain  over the  Moroccan question.                            PORTUGAL.    The situation in Portugal is more stable.  The  strike at the port of Lisbon ended on 12th October, and although the revoluntary strike still continues  the Government have been able to increase the  train services, and men  appear  to  be returning to work.   A railway strike and dock strike have broken out, but,  so far, no serious disturbances have occurred. The Government  have arrested a number of agitators and have called  up the reserves of two divisions.    Much of the discontent in Portugal is due to bad distribution of food-- stuffs.   Efforts have  been made by  the Government  to  improve this situation and to lower prices generally, but, so far, without much success.Except perhaps in Lisbon, the new orders and restrictions of the Goyern,-ment with regard  to food prices are invariably evaded.    It is rumoured in Holland that, in addition to the Sub-Bureaux of theThird International which have  been established in Berlin and Amster-dam, another Bureau is to be formed at Lisbon, which is to deal withBolshevik affairs in Portugal, Spain, and Italy.
              2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES.                            NORWAY.The Split in the Norwegian Labour Party.    The  question  of  tho acceptance  of  the  Moscow conditions  foraffiliation to the Third International has caused a split in tho NorwegianLabour Party.   It  was  the Moderate Socialists who took action ;  the extremists, who felt themselves  beaten, being in favour of evading  theissue until the present movement  of  revolt  from Moscow had workeditself out.    Lenin&apos;s 21 points are  a  cause of  great division  in  Socialist circles.The extremist Scheflo  is for accepting them; Ole Lian  opposes him,while Martin Tranmel is working hard for a  reconciliation between thetwo.  Jacob  Friis supports Scheflo, and there  were  indications towardsthe middle of the month  that the only way to  steer clear of the seriousjeopardy to the Norwegian Labour Party and the revolutionary movementin  Norway  which  a split  would  cause was  for Extremists  to  grantconcessions to the Right Wing.    So  sorely circumstanced, a deputation consisting of  Ole Lian, KyreGfepp, and Olaf  Scheflo went to  Halle to meet Zinovieff, who was thenattending the Congress of the German  Independent  Socialists, and from whom they hoped that some dispensations from  or interpretations of  the21  points might be obtained to soothe Ole  Lian and the trade unions.Zinovieff, however, was  unable to give the  necessary assurances, and  thesplit occurred.    Lenin&apos;s 21 points have, in fact,  caused a general  reaction in Norwayamong extremists  against the Bolshevik  Government.   They had animmediate effect  upon  the  Scandinavian  Young  Socialist  week,  heldsimultaneously at  Christiania, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, which wasfinanced  and organised  from Moscow with a  view to  making YoungSocialists the  leaders  of the  Scandinavian Communists&apos; movement.Scandinavian Communists  perforce  fell back  upon a  scheme for  theeducation of Young Socialists and Communists, so relegating the matter to  a more  distant future.  The  Central  Revoluntary  Committee  atChristiania, however, embarked upon  the establishment of a Central Com-mittee of Workers&apos;  and Soldiers&apos; Councils.    Among the instructionsreceived  by this  Committee  from Moscow,  stress was  laid upon  thenecessity of  concentrating all  efforts against  Great Britain, vulnerableespecially through her Eastern dependencies.

which it excluded them seem even  more brilliant.   He  admitted to Olal&apos;Scheflo,  the Norwegian  extremist, that  be  did  this  to further the diplomatic recognition of Soviet Russia.    Nowhere do his proceedings in this regard  appear to have been moreflagrant  than in  his dealings with the firm of  Niels, Juul &amp; Co., whichhas been recognised as the Norwegian representative organisation for theRussian  co-operative  societies  under Soviet control.   This firm has abad war  record  from the Allied  point of view.  It was intimately eoii-cerned with M.  Litvinoff before  ho left Norway, more apparently to thatslippery  gentleman&apos;?  satisfaction than  to  its  own. - M.  Juul  is nownegotiating with M. Krassin.   Several  big  gold  transactions  have beencarried through, and  the firm appears  to  have been  concerned in the transmission  from  lleval of the 90 boxes of  gold  recently  landed atBoulogne, and  forwarded  thence by train  to  Lyons.  Juul  himself  is merely a business man. politically  amoral.   It  is  believed that he  isnow in great fear of  M. Krassin following  the  example of M. Litvinoffand leaving him in the lurch.Socialists&apos; and  Extremists&apos; Educational Schemes.    With Alfred Madsen&apos;s return from Moscow the Socialist educationalscheme  outlined at the congress of  tho  Norwegian Labour Party began to be put into practice.  Labour  is to  be educated both for confidentialpositions in  the labour movement and for propaganda purposes.  Onlyworkers  belonging to trade unions and  political organisations  are to beadmitted under  the scheme.  A school  for  propaganda has been opened in Christiania.   Trygve&apos; Lie and other Norwegian  extremists are amongthe  professors, and  the  curriculum  includes the  secret organisation  of schools ;  propaganda in towns, factories, and schools : a Red intelligence service; the organisation of courier and liaison  services; methods  for avoiding police  and customs cordons and visas.   Litvinoff has subscribed*10,000 kroner to this school, and subsidies  have also been received fromthe Norwegian and Scandinavian Bolshevik authorities.Syndicalists.    Norwegian  Syndicalists are unardrrious  in  opposing the dictatorshipof  the Communist International, and may start a  movement against  th-iNorwegian Labour Party, which would &quot;result in  its breaking  up.  the sections  into which  it would  dissolve would be a  Christian Socialist, aRight Wing Socialist, and a Communist or Syndicalist. Party.   Bolshevikleaders in Russia are much concerned with the attitude  of NorwegianSyndicalism, which they regard as a serious menace.    The  Norwegian labour disputes Party, through the extremists Olaf Schefloand Kyrre Grepp, now control  the whole Socialist press of Norway, amithe correspondents of that press bureau  also act as  agents for the party and transmit information to it from abroad.  A special  section of  thepress  bureau is in charge of the so-called &quot; indirect&quot; propaganda in  thebourgeois  press, which aims at financial defeatism and at  exaggerationsregarding the importance of action taken by Labour and the influence ofsocialist organisations.  The ultimate object is to frighten  employers andshareholders, and through  them to compel  governments to recogniseSoviet Russia.Transport Workers.    The  Norwegian Labour Party mis received  instructions from moscow to  organise  the transport workers  into the nucleus of an InternationalTransport Workers&apos; organisation to be affiliated  to Moscow.   This is on      O  AS 8480                                               .  Ti
. all fours  with  what  is pending  in  other countries.  Swedish  transport workers who have  received the same directions  have handed  in  their notices  and  have  been guaranteed  support  in case of a  strike by the Norwegian   transport workers.  The  Norwegian  Transport  Workers&apos; Federation  is negotiating  with railway  and Irani way workers, sailors, stokers, and dockers&apos; organisations, ostensibly  to stop the  transit  of Russians to  light against  the Russian  Red Army.  Once  it is  complete the liaison will no doubt be used for other purposes. The Norwegian Labour  Party&apos;s   Protection Corps  and Guards  of        Action.     A working nien\s Protection Corps  was founded  at the end of August by the Norwegian  Labour Party to  protect labourers against injustice in cases  where  neither  law  nor  the  labour organisations  can help.   It is proposed to form similar organisations  in Denmark  and Sweden.   Coui- munist Guards of Action  have  been started by Olaf Scheflo and Alfred Madsen.   These bands are to be used in a more offensive manner for the terrorising of moderate labour, for strike breaking, and even  for organised hooliganism  should an opportunity occur.                             SWEDEN. The Extremists  and  the  Third International.    The Swedish  extremists appear to stand nearer acceptance of  LeniVs 21  points  than those  of any country except Italy.   At a meeting of the Executive Committee  of the Communist Parly it was decided, by 13 votes to 2, to  accept them  in principle,  emphasis  being  laid  on the passage implying the elasticity of the programme of the Communist International, and the  allowances  to be  made for the  situation in different countries. A general vote of the  party on  this resolution  will be taken in February. In  the  meantime the party reserves  the right  to propose amendments at the next International Congress. Trade Relations with Russia  and  Turkey.    In the  first  half  of October, a  Russian  delegation  under  George Lomonosoff met Palmstierna and informed that minister that the status of the Russian commercial representatives in Stockholm&apos; was to bo raised. This course was  taken after an exchange of views with Krassin, who,  it is  rumoured, may  settle  down  in Stockholm  should he not. prosper in London.   LomonosofF  laid stress on  the benefits  to Sweden of  the large                                                                 &quot;TV business transactions she had had  with  Russia, adducing  as  evidence the orders placed with  the firm of Axel  Christen sen.   Litvinoff,  while in Christiania, had gone  further and had  vainly endeavoured, through the Central Bolshevik Committee at Stockholm, to get  a resolution passed, recommending the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sweden and  Russia.    The  25  million  crowns deposited  in a  Stockholm bank  as  cash security for goods sent  to Russia in  accordance  with the contract made with Krassin  and Gunnar  Anderssen having  been  absorbed by Swedish deliveries  of  goods,  Anderssen&apos;s syndicate  warned LomonosofF,  the Bolshevik  trade  representative,  that  unless a  further supply of gold  was? deposited in  Stockholm further  contracts would cease.   Seventy-eight boxes of gold, value 60 million roubles, were accordingly despatched fromReval to Stockholm.   Swedish Communists  at  Constantinople  have concluded trade  agreements  with the  Ottoman Government,  whereby
Gothenburg will become the centre of Swedish-Turkish commerce and of swedish  trade  in the Levant.   The Norwegian Government has been invited to participate in this scheme.Russian  Intrigues.   Dr. Alexandroff, a worker for the Rosta News Agency expelled from sweden in the  second half of  September, proceeded to Reval for work with the Delegation there, despite a warning from Gulcovsky that thoEsthoniau authorities were likely to give him  a warm reception.   On Madsen&apos;s arrest  the Swedish  Young Socialist Party receivedfunds from  Soviet Russia to contiuue the  publication of the Roda Fanor(Red  Flag) for propaganda in  Scandinavia.  Jewellery to  the valueof 12,000,000 kroner is said to  have been recently insured on behalf ofthe Bolsheviks  in Sweden and  the Swedish police have information  that large  amounts of Bolshevik gold are being  smuggled into  the  country from Germany in sailing vessels.Aaland Islands.   The Swedes appear confident that the League of Nations will support their claims and their commercial, military, and administrative plans for taking over the Islands  are said to be well on their way  to completion.They intend to  construct a powerful naval base with coal and oil  stationson the Islands.   If  Sweden takes over the Aaland Islands it is intended to  appoint a certain Schwartz as governor.   Schwartz, who is a University councillorand a member of the  Upper House, is reported to be one of the most pro-German of  Swedish politicians.                           DENMARK.Trade with Russia.   There is a  general similarity of procedure  between  the  Bolshevikapproaches in the matter of trade in Denmark and in England.   In  eachcase they have induced  the Government  to  open  tentative  negotiations and have endeavoured to persuade them  that a  commercial agreementmust  be reached before money  owed by the Bolsheviks for propertystolen in Russia can be  paid.   In Denmark the Government  have  beenin touch with  Furstenberg-Ganetski,. the Bolshevik  representative  atRiga.  He has stated that the Danes must give credit until Russo-Danishcommercial operations are  in full swing.   A committee has been formedof representatives of Danish industry and finance, under the presidency of Max  Ballin.  They will draw up a Dano-Russian treaty, which is then to be submitted to Krassin.   Financial and  industrial   magnates in  Denmark  have decided  to address a note to the Government urging the  re-establishment of relationswith  Soviet Russia, alleging  that good  business was  being done byEngland, France, Sweden, and Holland  and that unless Denmark takes asimilar  course  the country -would be faced with bankruptcy.   How fartheir  satisfaction with  the business being transacted  between  thesecountries and Soviet  Russia was based upon  precise knowledge does notappear.  From information received much  of the good business  transactedin this country by the Russian Delegation seems rather in the nature ofa mirage.   The Danish Government has, however, yielded to the extent that a soviet commercial delegation will be allowed to  go to Denmark provided a  Danish  commercial  delegation  is allowed to  go  to  Russia.   The    0 AS 8486                                                  g
 Government maintains  the right  to  keep a watch  on members of any Russian delegation entering Denmark. Syndicalists.    The Danish Syndicalist, Marie Nielsen, who Avas reported in our last issue as having attended  the  Third International Congress at Moscow and having  declared in favour of strict  adherence  to the Third Inter- national, has now become the paid agent of the  Soviet Government at a salary of 500  crowns   a  mouth.  Friction  between  the  Danish Syndicalists and  the Central  Communist Committee  in  Stockholm on the  question  of adherence to the Third  International on  the  basis  of Lenin&apos;s 21 points is still going  on and Aage Jorgenson has had to go to Stockholm to try to smooth it down.  Danish Syndicalists still repudiate their  adherence  to the  Third International to which  Marie  Nielsen pledged them.           3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.                            HOLLAND. Negligible  Effect  of Propaganda.    The country as  a whole remains phlegmatic towards  revolutionary propaganda.   Despite  the  urgent  instructions  the Executive Council of the Third  International that the work must bo prosecuted with fervour among farmers and agricultural  labourers the actual performance does not seem to have got beyond the inauguration of professional councils and a system of correspondence.  Only in the eastern part of the province of Groningen has there been the  slightest  response among labourers.   The meeting on the 27th September at  Rotterdam under  the  auspices of the Dutch Communist Party, where the delegates of the Third  International at Moscow were to render  account  of their doings, fell very flat.   Only two out of three delegates turned up and  these  in their  speeches failed to carry conviction or to disguise the disastrous  state of affairs in Russia and the ineptitude of the Soviet Government in  coping  with it. Extremists.   The fact that revolutionary propaganda directed by Moscow is having small effect upon the  populace does not, however, imply a cessation of intrigue.  Impassivity on the part of the people, and hostility on the  part of the  Government, makes it the more urgent for extremists to maintain their systems of intelligence and of communication.  At a conference to this end between an emissary of Moscow and Dutch Communists  at the Hague the  former laid  stress on the  vital importance  that Communists should obtain posts in the Foreign and War Offices of every country, and should endeavour to get copies  of important  documents passing  through these Offices  passed to the local  Communist  Intelligence Service for transmission to Moscow.   The  Dutch Socialist Intellectuals are being employed to  carry on propaganda in the Army and Navy, and  a new organ, entitled &quot; Soldaten Tribune,&quot; is  to be published for the purpose.   As its name indicates, it will deal with grievances in the  ranks, and will  use them for subversionof discipline and incitements to mutiny.   The Revolutionary Red  Cross at Amsterdam has  a  two-fold object;it  shelters revolutionary propagandists and foreign revolutionaries, and it also  serves . all  revolutionary  international  purposes aud  maintains  a
391courier service of its  own.  It is  in  touch with bureaux established in sweden, Vienna, and Geneva. -   The visit to Holland of  Rabindranath Tagore has not come up to the expectations of  the  Dutch  Socialist  Party.  Moscow had particularlyinstructed Sneevliet  to sound  the poet as  to  the  possibility  of histhrowing in his lot with the  Third International.  What actually passed between them is unknown, but the  Dutch Commuuist Party has reportedto Moscow unfavourably on Tagore&apos;s attitude.Revolutionary Socialist Intellectuals.   At a meeting of the Socialist Revolutionary Intellectuals in Hollandit  was reported that the party had  been instructed by Wynkoop that  allprospective members must agree to  accept Lenin&apos;s  21 points.   The party is  much divided on the  subject.  It explains Leuin&apos;s attitude, and hispreference for few but  strong fighters, to an unfaithful multitude by hisdisgust at the conduct of the Amsterdam Bureau  and  of the CommunistLabour Party in  Germany.   Nevertheless,  it  is  thought  that  theIntellectuals will not  consider these sufficient reasons for  a dumb sub-mission to dictation from Moscow.   Wynkoop has given instructions thata commission of four or five members of the Intellectual group in Hollandare to be put at his disposal for the purposes of handling political  affairs.   The meeting of the Dutch Socialist Intellectuals  was much concerned about  the impression made on the British  revolutionary proletariat  byMr. Lloyd George&apos;s charges  against Kameneff.  The meeting was alsoexercised  by  the  lack of  revelations  about Mr.  Krassin,  of  whoseextensive relations they could  not  conceive that the British Governmentcould be ignorant.  KemenefFs discomfiture  was  generally attributed tocarelessness  on  his part in his  dealings with the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; andtrades unions and Krassin&apos;s exemption from  blame  to England&apos;s desireto make use of him in the future.   At a meeting  on the 29th September  it was stated  that arms andfunds were available in Sweden for use in France, and that arrangements were  being  made  by the extremist leaders of the Transport WorkersFederation in Holland for smuggling them into that  country.   Ravensteyn,  Wynkoop&apos;s  co-editor  on the &quot; Tribune,&quot;  was asked toaccept the leadership of the Revolutionary Socialist Intellectuals  in viewof the Moscow decision that these  posts should  be held in every  country by a leading member of the Communist Party.Sinn  Fein and  Bolshevism.   At the  meeting   of  Revolutionary  Socialist Intellectuals  held inAugust in Amsterdam there were interesting indications of the channelsthrough  which  Soviet  Russia conducts its  intrigues with  Sinn  FeinIreland.  The importance of the Sinn Fein movement as a weapon againstImperialism was emphasised by one of the  speakers.  In itself national,it had at least one characteristic  iu common with Communism,  namely,that it was a work for freedom.  Hence  it was argued that it had earnedthe support of all revolutionaries.    Groups in Germany, Belgium, and Holland have already supplied the sinn Feiners with money  and arms,  the Dutch comrades  in  particularsupporting the movement by smuggling arms from Germany into Belgiumfor transmission to  Ireland.  It  was reported at the meeting that  the correspondence formerly carried on direct with Irelaud  was now donethrough  English comrades;  that  Holland had hitherto been the mainlink between Russia and Ireland, but that French Communists were now taking a  share  in the work.  Arms and munitions  formerly sent  viaBelgium may now be sent through Scandinavia.
Christian  Socialist Party.   The Christian Socialist Party, whose representative  in  the  second chamber  is  the  llev.  Dr.  Kruyt,  and which adheres to  the  ThirdInternational, is the upholder of  a sort  of Christian Communism.  It isnow in process  of disintegration.  Two  important  groups have split off from  the  parent  body-the Religious  Anarchist   Communistic group,which preaches revolution  without  violence,  and  the Union of RightThinking  Christian Socialists, which  emphasises tho Christian characterof its beliefs.The  Burgerwacht.   The Minister  of  the Interior in Holland  is  endeavouring to obtain agrant of between  700,000 and 800,000  florins for the Burgerwacht andthe  Landsturm.  It  would  seem, therefore, that  the Burgerwacht  idgradually  becoming a Government organisation.                            GERMANY.The  Reaction against Bolshevism.   Extremists in  Germany are depressed.  Strike meetings are resolvingthemselves into  sound  and  fury, signifying  nothing.   Daeumig, therepresentative of German Extremists at  the Third International, is bitterin his complaints of the readiness with  which  workers hand over their arms.   Bolshevism, in short, appears to be  on  the  wane.  In the  Ruhrdistrict the difference between the mental and  political  atmosphere now and in the spring  of  the year is remarkable.   Irritation has  given  place to the absorption  of  the workmen in schemes for  their own immediatebetterment, and ideas regarding  world revolution will uot appear unlessthe situation  becomes really desperate or a Putsch  is organised by theRight, both of them contingencies improbable at the moment.   German workmen who have  returned from Soviet Russia say that ifthey had  been  asked&apos; to attend  the  recent Independent  Socialist PartyCongress at Halle they could have given first-hand evidence both  as  tothe Bolsheviks&apos; treatment  of them and as to conditions in the CommunistArmy, which would have been of more use than the long-winded speechesof Zinovieff and Bukharin  about the  friendship  of the Reds  for theGerman workers.   The  Sub-Bureau  of  the Third  International, despite the arrival of 300 trained agitators from Moscow, makes no headway inits desperate  strivings  for  a general  strike.   Meantime  a  policy  oflightning strikes is being continued until the time  for a more ambitiousmovement shall arrive.   Losovski, head of the Russian Trade Union Delegation,  took a handin organising local strikes at Neukoeln.   His efforts were abortive,  and a repetition of  them eventually led to his expulsion, along-with Zinovieff,by the German authorities.  Kopp&apos;s protest to  the Government regardingthis  expulsion led Von Simons  to tell him  that he himself was only inGermany  on sufferance.   The expulsion of Zinovieff and Losovski appears to have marked theturning point in  German policy  at home and  abroad.  Dr.  Fehrenbachstated in  the Reichstag  that there was no intention of impairing thetight of free political activity,  but  that this  right stops short at thebarriers of the law.  As the Communist Party professes the Moscowprinciples of  violence and of communistic despotism anyone taking the oath to Moscow places himself outside the pale of  the law, since by this
oath he assumes  an obligation to overthrow the state by violence&apos;and civil war.Zinovieff and the  Secret German General Staff.    During his stay in Berlin,  Zinovieff was  in  close touch With the secret General Staff, with  whom  he  discussed the question of  military support which&apos;Russia was to  render Germany.  Zinovieff stated that hehad no authority to give  guarantees  of  military assistance, but  that  liecould affirm that  in the case of social revolution breaking out in Germany,and this  revolution helping  the Soviet Government to beat their worstenemy, France,  the Bolshevik  authorities would  guarantee the futureGerman Soviet Republic complete territorial restoration.The Orgesch Organisation.    The Orgesch organisation in Germany has approached the Dutch G-overnmeut for support.   The  latter, however, is chary of helping the organisation,  which, though  ostensibly  anti-Bolshevik, is entirely con- trolled by anarchist elements which would  not hesitate  to  join up with Bolshevik forces should  an  alliance  between the German Monarchists and Soviet Russia  become possible.   Both the German Extreme Left and the Orgesch are reported to  be  trying to repurchase arms recently exported to neutral countries  from Germany.   The presumed strength of the Red Army in various districts of Germany  is stated to be Berlin.....  16,000 (10,000 workmen andExtremists.   Russian money and  jewellery  continues to  flow  into  Germany.Towards the end  of  February  Kopp was  reported to have received5,000,000  marks through  a  firm of  jewellers  in  Berlin, in  addition to4,000,000 marks received on 17th August  from Reval.  On 7th Octobera Bolshevik courier is said  to have arrived in Berlin carrying 3,500,000marks and foreign money and jewellery.The Spartacus-Bund in Germany.    The Spartacus-Bund in  Germany has  established  connection  with the  Dutch Socialist  Intellectuals.   There  are  German  Socialist  Intel- lectuals at Dantzig working as harbour  workers  for the  purpose of controlling the traffic and preventing the despatch of arms and ammuui- tion.  Others said to be  working in the occupied areas are there to infect the  troops with their doctriue and also maintaining observation upon any military forces which might be sent to East Prussia via Germany against the  Bolsheviks. Syndicalists.    German Syndicalists are violently opposed to Lenin&apos;s  21 points for admission to  the  Third  International, and have  characterised them as a declaration  of war, not  only against the bourgeoisie and the  Social Democrats, but also against the  revolutionaries who are not pronounced party  Communists.  The Syndicalists have refused  to join the elections for labour Soviets.6,000 unemployed).LeipzigRuhrHamburgStettin-  10,000.-  30,000.
 Economic.    The Government, in  order  to  improve the fiduciary situation,  has decided to diminish  the large quantities of  paper money at present in circulation, and to admit no further currency issues for some time.   Tt is further intended to socialise the coal mines  and to bring a scheme into operation which comprises forced labour for all men between the ages of 18 and 25.    Herr Hugo Stinnes is reported to be doing all he can  to bring France and Germany together, both politically and economically.   He is on good terms with Polish workers in  the Ruhr Gebiet, and with leaders of  the Polish Berufsverband, as well as with the  Polish Vice-Cousul in Essen, although some of his organs appear to be anti-Polish. A Syndicate for Trade with Russia.    A syndicate for  trade with Eastern Europe is being  promoted by an astute Amsterdam Jew named Barmat.   Its capital of 500 million marks will be increased  to 1,000  million if  necessary.  The  manager of  the Deutsche Bank, as well as important business men from the Ukraine, the Baltika Bank in Copenhagen, and the greatest German industrial houses are taking  part in the Syndicate,  which has  received important offers from Lomonosoff, the Soviet Commercial agent, who has offered to deposit gold  in a Scandinavian bank as security.   The Lithuanian Minister of Trade, now in  Berlin,  has also made  trade  proposals.   Whether this commercial scheme  is a cover for something of  political significance is unknown.   The foreign minister, Simons, and the chief of  the Berlin police are frequent guests of Barmat&apos;s at the Hotel Bristol.   A contract to supply the Soviet Government with military  equipment to the value of 24 million marks recently completed by a group of Germans may or  may not have to do with the matter. Oriental Intrigue,    A  Hindoo  and a  Brahmin, named Gill  and Mansur, are  reported  as organisers of an Indian  National movement in Berlin.  Subversive matter is printed in Berlin and forwarded by air to Russia, and  thence again to India.  Victor  Kopp organised the air service  with the technical advice of one Werner von Heeringen, who by  a  curious coincidence,  was previously reported to have despatched Monarchist  propaganda  by air to Russia.    Talaat Pasha, who lives at Hardenbergerstrasse  5 or  6 Berlin, is said recently to have  been  very active.   He  presides over  the  Turkish Egyptian  organisation,  which has 10 prominent members, one of them a cousin of  Enver Pasha.  The German Foreign  office is indirectly sub-.sidising Egyptian students  in Berlin.   The  money passes through  the hands  of a certain Herr von Kardoff and Sheikh Shawish, and  is finally distributed by Talaat in order that the Egyptians and everyone  else may believe that the money comes  from Pan-Islamic sources. &apos;The students in this way are induced to carry  out Pan-Islamic propaganda.                          SWITZERLAND. The Attitude  of the Government towards Russia.    The Government has taken up a position of  extreme firmness towards Soviet Russia.   The  Swiss Federal Council early in the  month declined the proposal of the  Social  Democrats, who  were  urging  upon  it  the resumption  of  commercial  relations  with that  country.   The  Swiss
Government has  also refused  to allow Russian delegates  to the SwissTrade Union Congress to enter the country.    The authorities appear to have made careful arrangements to preventthe spread  of revolution  to  Switzerland  from  adjacent countries audelsewhere.  The peasants are  now  stated  to be relatively unaffected byextremist propaganda.  Though Zurich is apparently a  danger spotowing to the vacillation of the authorities in dealing with the Communist-movement,  the vast majority  of Swiss citizens can, it is thought, bedepended  upon to support all  measures taken to ensure the sanctity ofprivate liberty and property.Communism.    Among extremists, Lenin&apos;s 21 points have been  a cause of dissension.Grimm, Charles Nanin,  and Paul Graber will have none of them, whileWelti aud Cesar Graber recommend  their acceptance.   Those, like Nobsand Schneider, anxious for  the unity  of the  Party, are endeavouring tofind a compromise in order  to  avoid a definite split.  Even these, how-ever, are opposed to the Moscow conditions.  At a meeting of the SwissCentral Socialist party at Olten on October 11th, a proposal to adhere tothe Moscow International was rejected by 4.7 votes  to 27.    Reports of meetings  elsewhere give indications of the usual plans forthe distribution of Bolshevik  literature and   propaganda  among SwissSocialists, y    The Communist Party iu Switzerland appears to be concentrating its main  efforts on  the corruption of  the rising generation,  a task nowengaging  the energies of the notorious  Rosa Grimm in Basle.   A &quot; work-meu&apos;s  children.&apos;s  week &quot; was  held at  the end of September, when the&quot; Basler Vorwiirts &quot; was  particularly active  in its propaganda,  which attacked  the prevailing system of  education  and described patriotism,reverence, and obedience  to  the law as  vain  images maintained  bycavalry charges and machine guns.                             AUSTRIA.The Elections.    The Communists have sustained  a crushing defeat in  the electionfor the Austrian National Council.  No Communist was elected and notmore than 25,000 votes were given for the  party.  The Social Democratshave  lost  their  dominating  position.   The   Christian  Socialists  have gained 15 seats at  their and  the Pan-Germans&apos; expense, and have now become the strongest party in the Chamber.  At  Vienna more womenappeared at the polls than men.  The former Foreign Minister, CountCzernin, was elected by the middle class party.    The Communist debacle must be more galling  to Moscow in that itlias befallen the Extremists despite frenzied efforts on the part of theThird International and  a lavish expenditure of Russian money.  several members of the Berlin Communist Bureau were sent to Vienna  to assist in the electoral campaign.   Moscow sent two agitators for the occasion,with 8,000,000 Austriau crowns.  With the  assistance  of  Bronski, theSoviet agent  in  Vienna,  propaganda schools,  recruiting  offices,  and secret Communist printing  works were established. Bronski  now  findshimself bereft  of funds  and is applying for  3,000,000 crowns  to Koppin Berlin, who has  duly guaranteed  that  all Bronski&apos;s debts  shall bepaid by the Third International and  has ordered the Western Secretariatto subsidise him further.
     The  result of the  elections  will  have  satisfied the  head of the Austrian  police,  who has  been  laying  great stress on tho growth  of Communism in the Wehrmsicht especially in Styria, into which he stated money has been flowing from Russia through Vienna,  The disbanding of  this  force, according  to him  not  less  dangerous than  the old Volkswehr, he regards among  the most  pressing  duties  of  the  new Government. The Monarchists.     The  reported collaboration  of the  Hungarian Monarchists with Monarchists in Bavaria1 to establish  a monarchy in Austria of a Hapsburg rule is confirmed by the Austrian police.  These activities are apparently known and approved  by the Bavarian Government, but their scope and aim are still somewhat indefinite.  The project accords with the general lines of French policy.  It would have the effect for one thing of shifting the  Germanic  centre  of gravity  eastwards, and its  achievement would also fulfil the  three conditions of French  policy, since it  would be  in effect anti-Bolshevik, anti-Anschluss, and,  at the  outset at least, anti- Germanic.  As regards French policy in the southern regions of  Central Europe, a situation both  curious in itself  and historically  bewildering would appear to have arisen Avhereby the French Republic  is displayed as the most Monarchist of the victorious European powers.    A conference of  arch-dukes recently held at Alteu aud presided over by the Emperor Charles upheld the restoration of Charles to  the throne of Hungary.   French  policy  thus  comes into direct conflict with the policy of tho little  Entente, which  makes the re-establishment of the Hapsburgs a casus belli against  Hungary.  As  stated elsewhere (see under Czecho-Slovakia) the  little Entente appears to  have been brought about largely by the fears of  the States composing  it lest their essentially democratic constitutions should suffer between the pressure of a possible restoration  of  the Monarchy in Austria  and Hungary and  the Czarist Russia which  they  fear may follow a possible  collapse of the Soviet regime. Miscellaneous.    A commercial  agreement has  been  arrived at  between  Austria and Roumania, whereby exports  to the extent of  12 billions of  kronen may be sent into Roumania free of duty.                             HUNGARY.    Recent  statements  in  the Hungarian Diet indicate  the imminent restoration of the monarchy.  The  ex-Emperor Charles  is reported  to have been  receiving many visits from the Princes Sixte and Xavier, of Bourbon,  and  from  Bela  Henry,  former  Deputy of  the, Hungarian Parliament.  The  latter, after his interview  with the ex-Emperor, stated that  the people of Hungary, led by the  population  of Budapest, insis- tently demanded the re-establishment of the monarchy.  The ex-Emperor^ entourage is reported  to go even further and to  have aspirations for a  reconstitution of  Austria-Hungary as an Empire with Charles as Emperor.                       CZECHOSLOVAKIA. General.    Fears  of Monarchist restorations in  Austria, Bavaria, and possibly also in Galicia on  the  one hand, and of  the eventual  overthrow of the
Soviet regime on the other, are causing President Masaryk aud Moderatesgenerally to veer  towards a Republican alliance based upon the strengthof the Jittle Entente,  as well as  more widely  to  the formation of  anInternational Republican  League of the Democratic Powers to support them in maintaining the  Republican form of  government.   It is fearedin responsible  circles  that,  should the  Soviet Regime  founder,  theMonarchist  powers would  endeavour to replace it by a form of govern-ment, democratic perhaps in intention, but formally and even dangerouslyMonarchist.  In tho view of President  Masaryk,  M. Benez and theirassociates,  Republicanism  requires a spiritual stronghold  of some kind,which, failing Russia, France  now all but Imperialist, and a de-WilsouisedAmerica, the little Entente might provide.   Information received  from a reliable source indicates that  the recent visit to Prague of Mr. J.  H. Thomas, of the National Union of Railway-men, was not unconnected with President Masaryk&apos;s  endeavour to get into  touch with Labour  parties in Monarchist countries and to obtain their support for his policy.   That visit was undoubtedly also contrived  to strengthen the hands ofthe Social Democrats in their opposition to the Communists.  It appearsto have been  a great success.  Mr.  Thomas appears to  have left  an impression of genuine Socialism combined with moderation which shouldbe of effect in  a country where the left hand of the Socialists is frequentlyextended towards the Communists.Russian Intrigues.   Further evidence places it beyond  question  that  Dr. Gillerson,ostensibly head of the Russian Red Cross Mission,  is really directing theBolshevik movement on  behalf of  the Moscow Government, with whichhe is  said to be able to  communicate twice daily by wireless.   His dis-appointment at the failure of his attempt to  persuade  the  Intelligentsiato pay attention to Bolshevik ideas is said to be great.  He has turnedhis attention, therefore, to minds more immature, and is trying to influence the rising generation  through the university students,  whose chronicimpeouniousness  will, he  believes, render them specially liable to argu-ments  from Moscow.  He has  also succeeded in establishing  groups ofSocialist  Intellectuals in  Czecho-Slovakia and in putting them in touchwith similar organisations in  France, Switzerland, and Holland.   Dr. Gillerson  has  reported  to  Moscow that WrangeFs agents  have created recruiting  centres iu Czecho-Slovakia, Jugo-Slavia,  and Hungary,and  that Russian Socialist  revolutionaries  who  have emigrated  from paris  to   Prague  are   becoming a  serious  menace  to   the  SovietGovernment.   Lomonosoff, on a recent visit to Prague, gave considerable  financialassistance to the Russian  Communist group there to carry on propaganda in opposition to the Russian Reactionary groups in that city.The Communists and the Social  Democratic Party.   In official circles the  Bolshevist danger is  scouted.  The CommunistParty  is described as lacking in leaders.  The intelligence  of Dr. Smeralis greater than either his physical or  his moral courage.  He is  also stated to  be  seriously compromised  by his  relations  with the  policedepartment of the  former Austrian  Empire.  From the  governmentalpoint of view he is therefore  an ideal revolutionary leader.    As regards adherence to the   Third  International, the CommunistCongress held at Prague at the end of September  came to no decision.It advocated the expropriation without compensation of factories, banks,
 mines, and insurance societies, the establishment of Workmen&apos;s Councils, and compulsory work for all persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years, but its demand for the resignation of the committee of the Social Democratic Party was ineffectual  and was bluntly refused  on the ground that the Communists  did not represent the majority of the party.    In the Tescheu-Bodenbach  district Communist agitation is  said  to have increased of late and in Warnsdorf the results of  the recent election for the Workmen&apos;s Councils show an increase of radicalism.   Warnsdorf is dangerous  ; the Communist centre there is supported from Saxony, where arms are collected in Eberbach, Sebnitz, and Nixdorf.  Eger and Pilsen are also  revolutionary, but  from  Kladno, generally the  most revolutionary centre in Czecho-Slovakia, comparative quiet is reported. The Social Democratic Party.    Acting on instructions from Moscow, the Czecho-Slovak Communists recently attempted to capture the whole organisation of the Czech Social Democratic Party, together with its printing offices, newspapers, funds, &amp;c.   The Bight Wing of the party, which has the inestimable advantage of President  Masaryk&apos;s counsel and sympathy, effectually resisted.  The rejected Communists have been  obliged  to  form a group of  their own. Despite their despairing efforts to maintain a foothold for themselves and for the Moscow programme, a meeting of the party on  21st September decided that  there was  no &quot; Right&quot; or &quot; Left&quot;  Wing  of the  Social Democratic Party, but only a Communist or  a Social   Democratic  Party. The split is, therefore, a  definite  one.  For the  present certain legal difficulties maintain the Communists in possession of the  party  offices and printing  establishment.   But they are  in a bad way.   The  Social Democrats and  the Government  have managed  to  deprive, them  of all deliveries  of paper and all  newspaper subscriptions.  Altogether the recent disputes within the Czecho-Slovak Social Democratic  Party have led to considerable gains  by the  Right at the expense of the extreme Left.  Even  at Kladuo, one  of the  most revolutionary centres  in the country,  there  has been  a two-thirds majority  of the Right Wing at almost all conferences.  The  split  has now extended to  the provincial organisations  of the party.   At a meeting of the German Social Democratic Party held at Karlsbad on 4th October a resolution was passed, by 244 votes to  144, declaring the willingness of the party to make  concessions to  the Communist wing in order to preserve the unity of the party as a whole,  but insisting on inde- pendence of the  German Social  Democrats  for the Third International or any international socialist organisation.         4. RUSSIA  AND THE BORDER STATES.                             RUSSIA.General.   The annihilation of the army  of General Wrangel and the junction ofthe Bolshevik and  Turkish forces across  Armenia are factors  of theutmost importance to the situation of the Communists.  Their effect onthe remaining opponents of the Soviet regime upon Russian soil  cannot but be very  great, if not conclusive.  They will profoundly affect, forinstance,  an  adventure  such  as that of General  Balakhovitch,  basedrather upon the  idea of arousing the sympathy of the  peasantry thanupon man power, which would appear now to be in imminent danger of being overwhelmed.  It remains to be seen which of the two possible alternative policies,  western  or  eastern,  will now be adopted  by the
Soviet Government.  There are indications that they will pursue  theirpolicy of frightening England in the East whilst soothing her in theWest, a policy directed to the recognition of the  Soviet Government  bythe Western Powers, whose countries  would then be permeated  withCommunist propaganda.   In the East the Turkish advance on Armeniahas led to the latter requesting the mediation of the  Soviet  authorities,who even before the absolute collapse  of Wrangel were strengtheningtheir position in the Caucasus.  The Russians do not trust the Turks,who,  they  think, are also  negotiating  with  the Entente.  They will doubtless undertake  the  mediation  which  Armenia  requires,   uponconditions.  It is  equally sure  that the  conditions they impose will  be such  as  to  make  of Armenia a  second Azerbaijan.   The way of theBolsheviks  with  small  and helpless  peoples  is  remarkable  in  itsuniformity.Prospects oi Revolt.   It was anticipated that risings of a more or less serious nature would occur in  many districts, during  aud after harvest.  Those which  have occurred are therefore  not  regarded  very seriously, although  they fre-queutly  result  in destruction of supplies  and communications.  there appears to be no  prospect of a serious revolt being organised against thepresent regime.   The elaborate precautions  of  the   Soviet authoritiescoupled with difficulties of communication, have, it is  believed, disposedof all  the plaus  which bad been made.   Djerzhinsky, the head of theChresvichaika, in  September demanded unlimited powers for his  Com-mission and all its branches to push the Terror to the extremest limits,in suppressing insurrection.   It  is understood, however, that  the SovietGovernment, dissatisfied with the activities of  the Extraordinary  Corn-mission,  has founded another body, the &quot; Committee  for the protectionof the Inner Security of the Soviet Republic,&quot;  whose powers are  evenmore  extended, and include  that of the arrest and trial of the members ofthe once all powerful Chresvichaika itself.    Even persons  strongly opposed&apos;to the present regime are reportednow to have lost all hope  of foreign  intervention, and, in the absence ofany  capable men  to replace the  present  Government to say that theexistiug  government, bad  as it is, is just preferable to anarchy.    The  town  population is apathetic.   It is improbable that townsfolkwould co-operate in a  counter-revolutionary movement until its  successseemed assured.   The bourgeoisie and poorer classes  exist from day today, absorbed in their struggle to live.   The lucky families are those whohaying some representative  in a government office, can obtain extra food,and help their relatives.   It is only in the country districts that risingsseem probable, but even,  then, owing to the difficulties of organisation,they  could not be on a large scale.    The  following  information regarding  conditions in  Siberia and european  Russia  and  the policy of the Soviet Government has beenobtained from two exceedingly  reliable witnesses.   One, an  Americanlately consulting engineer for the Siberian Government, has been able to observe  conditions very closely in the course of journeys by train, steamer,and drosky.  The other, also an engineer has long lived in  Russia, and since his return to this country in April last, has been working in close and intimate touch with the Russian Delegation here.Siberia: Agricultural Districts.    According to  the former of these informants, the  Siberian peasants,realising that they would be obliged to give up  their grain and to receivenothing for  it in  return have left unfilled  all but one-third of the laud
 which they used to cultivate.  The direct responsibility for this lies with the Reds.  In the first weeks after the Reds occupied Siberia they started buying grain from the peasants, paying them in Koltehak&apos;s money, which they then suddenly wiped out of  the currency.  This gave a blow to Red credit and currency in  Siberia from which they have never recovered. The Bolsheviks further compelled the peasants to bring their grain to the railway stations, rivers, and  other  accessible points  for removal in  the spring.   In  Siberia they preserve  beef in the  most primitive  kind of cold-storage ; they bury it aud allow it to  freeze.  The Reds obliged the peasants  to dig up the  beef aud place it, with the corn, near the railways and  rivers for removal.  Then came  the breakdown of  all transport; corn and  beef placed along the railway  lines for removal rotted.  When the rivers opened the  Rods  started to ship beef, but tho congestion of river traffic consequent on the breakdown of the railways made it possible to ship it only in very small quantities, so  that&apos;about 75 per cent, of it decayed on the spot, where it had  been lyiug  for days.  Of course  the peasants  drew their own supplies and  the townspeople suffered in con- sequence.  Both  peasants and townspeople were  very  much  agitated about it and in May of  this year there were local riots.    There is bitter feeling among  the  city peasants against the Central Government, but no organised reaction.  The Omsk  Soviet Government is lending its active support to this  ill-feeling in opposition  to the Central Government at Moscow.   The people themselves are hostile to  Moscow, and a split between the two Governments would, our informant thinks, lead to modifications in the Soviet system  at Omsk.  Our  informant was of opinion that there would be a disruption between Omsk and Moscow at the first opportunity.   When the food  crisis  arose Omsk sent some Very sharp wires to Moscow descriptive  of  the prevailing state of affairs&apos; and commenting  with  especial sharpness  upon the wipiug out of  the Koltcbak  money  after  the peasants had received  it in return for their produce.   The  Omsk  authorities  also  informed Petrograde  that  the supplies  had been  requisitioned  in far  greater  quantities  than  Avas warranted by the  transport available, and  that  in consequence they had deprived the townspeople in Siberia of what they might otherwise have received,  while at the  same time irritating the peasantry.   The division between  the two  governments developed,  and there was  more  fighting. Soldiei&apos;3,  chiefly European Russians,  with  some Czechs  and Austrian troops, were sent to Siberia.   The Siberian soldiers would not keep order among their own people.   When our informant  left  at the end  of May things were thoroughly bad.    After  the spring the peasants refused to plant.  Handicapped though they were by the lack of labour and machinery they  could still have put a much larger area under tillage this year than  they did.  As soon as  the Central Government occupied Siberia they promised, by proclamation, to give the peasautry their clothing and other commodities for  their supplies, The breakdown of their own industrial system prevented their honouring their promises, which was another  cause of Siberian ill-feeling towards them. Siberbia:  Industrial Position.    Of the mines formerly working in Siberia only a few coal mines were going on.   Neither iron  nor zinc mines  were working nor the platinum mines  in the Urals.  In  a few cases a  few individuals  may have been washing Some, but there was no serious work, and of course  no gold. On the Siberian  side of the  Urals  only  coal mines were  operating on a very small scale.   In one place there was  considerable  output, but even
here only  three  mines were  working out of  more  than twenty, and machinery had  been taken from  the others to keep  these  three going.All was done by forced labour.European Russia.    In  the  agricultural districts south of Moscow  the  same conditionsprevail.  The peasants  are  not  doing  what  they could,  though  theopposition  to the Central Government is not  so  acute  hero as it  is in siberia.  Generally the feeling among the peasantry is that the revolutionmust be saved, though  it has gone astray and has got into the hands of people who  are  not making  it  a revolution.  There  is no organisedopposition.  When  the peasants say that the  revolution must  continue,what they really mean is that they have got the land and are going tohold it.  Their complaint of  the  Bolsheviks is principally that they areunable to get anything in exchange for their grain.   Anyone who wouldgive them  something for  it they  would support.   They want clothes towear, and boots and other necessaries and conveniences.  They find thattheir land, now they have it, is  an unmarketable commodity, becausethey can do nothing with it,The Foreign Policy  of  the  Soviet Government: Commercial  and       Political.    It was  at once apparent in Moscow,  both to  those who had officialrelations and those  who bad not, that the Soviet Government was keenlyand increasingly interested in fostering foreign interests.  The  proposalsthey submit to  foreign commercial interests  are  unusually attractive.The Supreme Industrial  Council in Moscow, the Mining  Soviet,  andother economic branches realise that the  state  of affairs is so deplorablethat unaided they cannot bring it back  to what it was.  The Presidentof the Supreme  Economic Council, the President  of  the  Mining Soviet,and other members  of  the Supreme Industrial bodies realise that foreign capital and foreign management are essential to the  existence of theSoviet  Government.  Without them they simply  cannot  continue to exist.   They must have foreign  capital, and they realise that there isonly one way to get it, and that is to admit foreign  management, foreignengineers,  and to a certain extent the acceptance of foreign methods.    Below  these protestations  and this eagerness, however, our  informantcould  from  the  first  feel  that  there was a  deeper  aim,  to wit, theopportunity  for  opening  up  avenues   to the  outside  for  propaganda purposes afforded  by the resumption  of  trade  relations  with  othercountries.   The  whole feeling in Government circles  in Moscow  was that a communistic state could not exist alone, that it was vital to it thata part at least  of the  outside world should be converted to its way ofthinking and dealing.    At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the  Soviet Government at  Moscow  one  of the  members  said  to Krassin, who had  then just returned from London  to get in touch with his authorities before returning with Kameneff, that he  could not reconcile  the grant  of concessions to foreigners  with  the Communist  theory  of which  they were the incar- nation and which they preached  to  the  rest  of the world.   He went on to  say :  &quot; I do  not understand how we can possibly grant concessions to &quot; foreign capitalists and governments.   It is  defeating our own purpose. &quot; They will get such a  hold on our country that they will overthrow &quot; us.   It is better for us to  struggle alone  in  some  way than to give &quot; them  such an opportunity.&quot;  Krassin replied :  &quot; Our position  is so &quot; very desperate  that we must  have outside help; but even that is not
&quot; tbe most important reason.   Our avenues for  extending propaganda&quot; are being closed to us, and it is of first importance that we  should&quot; be  able  to  carry on this propaganda, for alone we  cannot live.  By&quot; opening  up negotiations we increase the  avenues  through which we&quot; can work.   That is our real object.  Foreigners will  not obtain  a hold&quot; upon Russia.  We  will let them  come and settle, but before they are&quot; too strong we will simply confiscate everything.&quot;   This, our informant  states,  depicts quite accurately what the peoplethere intend to do and  what is uppermost in their minus.   That is their real  policy.  In openiug up  relations  with foreigners  they have not anatom of  sincerity.  They do not  care  what they sign their names to.They have not the remotest idea of  honouring their boud once it ceases to be  to their advantage.   Their  true  aim  in trading  is  to  spreadpropaganda.   It is very literally their view  that the  mere fact  that  a contract  is entered into with a capitalist absolves them  from keeping it.The  Russian  Trade Delegation in  London  and  the   All-Russian       Co-operative Society.   It is interesting to observe  that  this view  of Russian policy is con-firmed by a British engineer  with  40 years&apos; experience of Russia, who,since his return to England  in April last, has  been the agent, in touchwith the  Russian Trade  Delegation  aud its  annexe, the  Ail-RussianCo-operative Society, of an engineering firm of  some standing in London.To obtain the utmost possible for  his employers, this informant has beenliving with Bagdatian,  an Armenian, who  serves on M. Krassin&apos;s dele-gation in the quality of an engineering expert.  After four months&apos; workhe has told his firm that he  can  no  longer act as their agent with theRussian  Delegation, and has preferred  to  sacrifice.his part  in the largecontracts which he has  been negotiating.  In his opinion the Delegationis in London simply to inquire into and influence labour conditions in thiscountry.  It is not really anxious  to do business.  For four months hehas  put  up contract  after contract  to  the Delegation ; all  have fallenthrough  at the last moment either  because the Delegation said they could get  the articles cheaper elsewhere  (and then  did  not go elsewhere) or byreason of some change in the specification when  the  contract was ready for signature.  It has been  learnt from  a reliable  quarter  that  a gooddeal of  similar play acting  is now going on between the Delegation,Messrs. Vickers, and Messrs. Armstrong.   On the strength of telephonemessages from time to time Messrs. Vickers have been  led to believe thatthey can get business from the Trade Delegation. The fact is, however,that Klishko only telephones  to  Vickers  when Armstrong^  people arein the room, using Vickers as  a bait to draw Armstrong on.  The Dele-gation have  no intention whatever  of  dealing with Vickers, whom they regard   as  suspect.   Bagdatian  confided  in  our  informant that the delegation had received instructions that this was to be their policy, andthat negotiations  regarding  contracts were to be  politely spun  out as long as possible  to no conclusion.  On one occasiou our informant,accompanied  by  Bagdatian,  went  to  Birmingham,  ostensibly  to  dobusiness.  All the  Armenian did  in  the different engineering  works which they visited was to find out  how many men were employed,  how many were out of work, how much they were  paid,  the feeling  among the labourers, &amp;c.  Six or seven young men  at the Delegation who came over with  Kameneff as  experts are, our informant states, simply here for the purpose of finding  out  labour conditions and mixing  with the men. These men have the entry to Krassin&apos;s  room  at auy time, aud enter without  knocking.  They  have  no  qualifications  as experts.   Our
informant comments on the quaint simplicity and uniformity of their modesof thought.   They recently had an offer to build a pipe line from Tiflis tothe Sea of d&apos;azof, which, it was  estimated,  would cost about 10,000,000/.Asked whether they thought that any Englishmen would  be prepared toput down such a large&apos;sum of money, they replied that as England would soon  be Bolshevik  the Englishmen might as well give their money nowas have it taken from  them later on.   As regards the  AU-ltussian Co-operative Society,  who sign  the contracts in this  country, all correspondence with them  is through  theTrade Delegation.  They are in no sense  a separate concern, aud  are there to maintain  tho  flimsy  pretence that the  old llussian Co-operative societies  which the Government has absorbed still  exist independently of it.MM.  Krassin and Kameneff.   Speaking of MM. Krassin and  Kameneff the  first of the informantsmentioned  stated  that  Krassin was  certainly not  a Communist,  butthat he was anxious  to let  his own Government think that he was anultra-Communist.  How far his trade policy as described above is devisedsimply to satisfy the extremists and  strengthen his own position it isdifficult to say.  Krassin is  doing  very well for himself in Russia,  andcares for nothing  else.  Our  informant believes  Krassin  to be  thecleverest politician in Russia, but says that he is not trusted in Moscow a statement of the truth of which there  is much independent confirmation.Moscow trusts Kameneff, in  ability  the lesser man of the  two.Prospects:  Commercial and Political.   Among leaders in  Moscow  it was  a  serious  question whether theywould be able to  maintain themselves  over the winter.   Not that therewas any organised opposition.   That did not  exist.  It was  a questionsimply of  the ability of  the Soviet Government to maintain its hold  overthe country.  In the sense that where the Soviet Government had failedeveryone else was likely to fail too, our  informant  thought  it was truethat the Soviet Government was as good as any other.   But only in thatsense.  A Red Army officer or forceful person might start an organisedforce in opposition from  Siberia or  the Ukraine, but this was a prospectexceedingly remote.   Religion  has  lost all power.  Only a  person  in aposition  to  make  a definite  statement  that  he had got  supplies would obtain support.  Provided such  a person  were forthcoming most people would not  care  what cause they  were supporting.  As regards  pay-ment, Russia has  not  the  raw material to pay  for  anything.   the tremendous reserves of which  people speak  simply do not exist.  Thereis no grain ; no manganese.   They could mine  the latter rapidly,  butthere is none in reserve.  They have oil in reserve, but it is  all requiredto keep the few  trains  they  still  have running.  No coal is available.That is consumed locally, because oil is easier to transport.  Timber theyhave, and of course they have  gold in reserve, but not their own.  Theirpolicy of  &quot; collecting&quot;  gold  and jewels  continues.   They surroundpeople  at  theatres, lead them off, deprive them  of their  gold rings,watches, and so forth.   Nearly all the valuables from  some of the conventshave been removed by  the local Commissars, who have received orders,as a result of a secret decree of the  Commissariat of Finance,  to seize theprecious stones decorating religious objects in the churches and convents.The stones are taken out of  their settings on pretence of restoring themand  replaced by artificial ones.    The  prospect  of  their holding the country  through the  winter is calculated at one in two.  Should  they fail  there will probably be, first,
n pogrom on a scale never known in Russia before, and afterwards a speciesof  anarchy which would change the face  of Russia to a tessellated pave-ment  of  small  independent peasant states, which  might gradually begathered up into some large confederation of provinces.  The Commissarsthemselves fear the pogrom, and  our informant could feel the possibilityof  it everywhere.  In Moscow he happened to be dressed in a whipcordworking  suit,  very ordinary, but apparently  better than that worn byother  people.  He was pointed  out everywhere as  a Jew.  As soon aspeople recognised that he was a  foreigner  their mauner changed.   Thopeasants in the small industrial towns outside Moscow appreciate foreignersas  they have never done, and say that the only  salvation  lies  in foreign capital and enterprise.   At the informant^ own works in  the Urals theyused to have 10,000 workmen.   They have now about 3,000 men.   Thisspring these men drew up  a  petition to  the effect that  it  would beimpossible to carry on the work  without first gettiug machinery  fromabroad.  They  continued : &quot; It is also our opinion that without foreign&quot; managers and foreign engineers it is very foolish to attempt to open up&quot; these mines.&quot;   This was signed by 3,000 workmen.  A copy of it was sent to Moscow, as the  mine was  under  the  Siberian department of theSoviet Government.   The peasants and  labourers are bitter against theintelligentsia and  the Jews, aud our  informant  fears that  should theSoviet Government fall the result would be disastrous for  both classes.Economic.   All efforts  to  restore the metal  industry and  coal production in theUkraine  and the  basin  of the Donetz  have  failed.  Where formerly400,000 workmen were  employed there are barely 100,000, aud in spiteof  the mobilisation of all workmen over 48  years,  as well as  engineers and technical workers,  which prevents their leaving  their  mines orfactories, production is very low.  A workman who now earns 360 roublesa day iu addition to his food and clothes only  produces about 200 poods*of  coal, in place of the average  of  500  or 600 produced  before the war.The workmen have become thieves, and are  lazy and demoralised.   Theirfood is wretched.  The mines  are in  a bad  condition.  Difficulties oftransport are increasing.   The nationalisation of  the mines and  factories, while stimulating thegrowth of the  number of functionaries, has  iu  no way  increased  pro-duction.    In  fact,   some of  the  smaller   undertakings  have  beendenationalised in order to obtain a better output.   Lack of transport has reduced the amount of coal sent to the interiorto  20,000,000 poods.  13,500,000 poods  were mined in April; this rose to  25,000,000  in  June, but  fell to 22,000,000  in August, when theworkmen left the mines and returned to their villages, where  they  could get more to eat.   Nor is the metal industry in better case ;  only about half of the 30 large factories are working, and these  with reduced staffs.    According  to the  report of  the German Export  Department, all that russia can export at present is the following :        Bristles     -     -    -     -     -     -     13,970 poods.

In accordance with the decision  of  the Executive Council of  the moscow Third International, Switzerland is in future to be the South-Western European centre  for propaganda ;  connection with France is  tobe established through the Zurich Bureau  instead of Amsterdam.  AHpropaganda material  is to enter by the  German-Swiss frontier stationof Singen, near Schaffhausen.  Propaganda for Italy will be made fromTrieste and Milan, Austria also being served from the latter,town.    The following message, which was transmitted from Moscow on 26thOctober, is a typical  example of  Bolshevik propaganda directed againstthe British :          &quot; In consequence of  the British coal  miners&apos; strike, over 1,000       factories  have ceased  working.   The  number  of  strikers have       increased to 1^ millions.  The Independent  Labour Party calls       upon all trade unions  to form extraordinary commissions  for  the       purpose  of taking swift decisions  in  the  struggle against  the       Government.   In the expectation of a general strike the Govern-       ment  is  making preparations to leave London for the country,       under the  protection of military forces.  The British coal miners       are not only demanding an increase  in  wages, but  also participa-       tion in the control of the mines.  The French and German miners       have  declared that they will  support their British  comrades with       all the means at their disposal.&quot;    After  this message had  been despatched the  Soviet Governmentappear to  have realised that this was going  a little too far,  and instructedM. Krassin to demand a denial from the Marconi Press that this messagewas ever  received by them.  On investigation it  was found that  the message had  been received at 3 p.m. on 26th October by an operator whowas in no way  conversant with the  Russian language&apos;,  and  had beensubsequently translated at Marconi&apos;s offices.  As further proof that  the message emanated from the  Soviet authorities the  Marconi Press were able to state that  it was radiated at  3 p.m. on  the following day in even greater detail in  a serial  issued  by the  Rosta Press Bureau, which isknown to  be under the control of Moscow. !    A copy of the Russian text received has  been forwarded toM. Krassinwith a request that he will inform Marconi  whether he will not prefer tohave an opportunity of reconsidering his desire that  the inquiries shouldbe communicated  to the press.Enver Pasha.    Enver  Pasha was  reliably reported to  be in Moscow on 24th August.He had just returned  from Berlin and reported to the Supreme Revolu-tionary and Military Council in Russia that  there was a great  difference of opinion between the officers of the Secret  Staff,  some of  whom wishto unite with the Bolsheviks, whilst  the more moderate  section are  in    0  AS 848?                                                  J)
favour of a revolution first, and thou, after the phase of terrorism had passed, an alliance with Soviet Russia.   Hindenburg and LudeudorfF adopted a more or less neutral attitude,but Generals Hoffman aud Luttwitu aud the National-League of officers were in favour of an immediate alliance with  the Bolsheviks.  In returnfor this alliance the League demands that Russia should immediately put at the disposal  of Germany  &quot; human material&quot;  for the war against france and Poland.   The National League of Gorman Officers, which has plenty of money and  ammunition at its  disposal,  is  working in close  touch with theGerman  Communists  (presumably  the K.A.P.D.), and a joint committeehas been formed.   Enver succeeded in obtaining the services of  28 officers belonging  tothis league, and  he intends to  employ them in the cast.  He was  muchstruck by the fact that not all  the  German officers were inclined to fight against England.                             FINLAND.Peace with Russia.   The signature of  the Peace Treaty between Finland and Russia  atDorpat on 15th October was, it is  hinted, to some extent due to the factthat members of  the Finnish Peace Delegation either  originally were  orhad more recently  become commercially interested in the  conclusion  ofpeace with the  Bolsheviks.   Walden had purchased two large paperfactories  of Yamsenkoski and  Simpeli, and it  is  reported that theBolsheviks promised  to  buy  their  paper  from  him  first  of all.MM. Paasikivi and  Frey had bought goods  in Germany and were acting as agents for German firms, who intended to  despatch the commodities to Soviet Russia via Finland.   While, however, the conclusion of peace  is  welcomed  by the largetraders, the population as a  whole  is much  worried about what willhappen to the stocks of provisions,  and fears that the wholesale clearance of these stocks to Russia, which will almost certainly  take  place, entailsfor Finland a shortage of supplies and a  further rise in  prices.  Theterritorial concessions are also criticised, and it is thought that directly a stable  government  is  formed  the   clause embodying  them  will  berepudiated.   The parislies of  Repola aud Porajarvi, which the Peace Treaty givesto the Bolsheviks, cry out that they have been betrayed by the Finns,aud are  doing their utmost to obtain  arms and  ammunition to enable alocal militia to defend them against Russia.Extremists.   Finnish extremists now in Petrograd are reported  to be intenselydissatisfied with  the Bolshevik regime  and to be eager to return to Fin-laud.   Koponen, one  of  the leading men of this  body, recently visitedViborg and commented on the  immeasurable superiority  of life there  tolife in Soviet Russia.   Finnish refugees who have returned to their own country from Soviet  Russia are very discontented with their treatment.Many are unable to speak the language of their native  land or to find employment.   The Government has, so far, not done anything to alleviatetheir difficulties.   Finnish Red  Comrades are reported to be acting a intermediaries forthe Bureau of the Third International at Berlin and Vienna, and to haverecently  sent 5,000 gulden to the Dutch Socialist Intellectuals in aid  oftheir movement.  The Government, who have.had knowledge of the Red
 tendencies  of  the Vihorg regiments  for some  time, have now given the matter full publicity in tho hope that open discussion  and comment may heal the sore.    The murder by armed Finns of  the  members of  tho Central  Com- mittee of the Finnish  Communist Party in  Petrograd is accounted for from very different standpoints.  On  the one hand it  is said that it was planned and carried out by Finnish Red officers to prevent  the despatch by  the Finnish Communist  Committee in Potrograd of  Finnish Red detachments to the Polish Front.   On the other it  is reported as a result of provocation on DjerzinskyV part, and to  have  been done in  order to terrorise  Finnish Communists  into acquiescence  in  the conclusion  of peace.&apos; Aaland Islands.    It is reliably reported that the Finnish Government intend  to defend the Aaland Islands if the decision of the League of Nations goes against them.  It is  not thought, however, that the League  will come  to any definite decision, but that it will temporise till Russia becomes settled,                           Baltic States.                             ESTHONIA. Political and Economic.    The position of Esthonia is depressing.   Bankruptcy appears inevit- able, and many Esthonians fear  that a return of one  sort or another to Russia is equally so.   Recent attacks  on that country by the  extreme Chauvinists  in Esthonia  must be taken as desperate  measures for  self- defence.  Discontent,  especially  in the  towns,  is attributable to high prices and the shortage of material, but  the Bolshevik  movement as such holds  few attractions for the  Estlionians, who are too close to Russian communism  to wish to  adopt  it.  Ministers, the  majority of whom are the  sons of small farmers, have unfortunately neither  experience of nor capacity for the posts they hold, and the delay in organising the resources of the country is due  in part  to  their  inexperience and in  part  to the propensity for procrastination which is inherent in the Slav temperament. With sufficient credits  Esthonia might  recover and might even become the  agricultural  equal  of  Denmark.  Flax  and timber she has in con- siderable quantities, but the industrial life of  the country is in its infancy, and she needs  machinery for factories  and works.  Germany is reported to be doing well in Esthonia, and has resumed I he underbidding of other countries made  possible for her  by the frugality of her population and the low price of the mark.   On October 8th the  Esthonian Ministry resigned, gracefully conceding to the probability of losses at the coming elections,  where it  was thought probable that the Social  Democrats  would lose   several  seats  to the Independent Socialists  on  the one hand and  the Nationalists on the other.   Mr. Tennison&apos;s succession as Premier of the new Ministry was thought secure. The  Soviet  Trade Delegation.   The Soviet Delegation  in Reval was reported in April to have made very large purchases, but to have so abased their trust  (it is said  that it even rendered fictitious accounts to Moscow) that Gukovsky was urgently called  home to justify its dealings.  He was later  allowed  to return to his post on the ground that his  dismissal would everywhere have shakenthe authority of foreign  representatives  of the Soviet Government.   All
transactions wore through intermediaries.  Not one was made direct witha well-known firm; and members of the delegation only purchased thingswhen thoy could earn something by the transaction.   Erlanger, Gukovsky&apos;s secretary, who was the chief culprit, attemptedwithout success, after his forced retirement from the delegation, to obtain a passport from Stockholm, whither ho had made his escape for England.An informant  in  close touch with Gukovsky states  tha&apos;he  changed asum of 20,000,000 roubles weekly, and sent the money abroad, to Irelandamong other places, for agitation purposes.  One of G ukovsky&apos;s principalproblems was to change Tsar roubles into foreign values for this purpose.Another of his  proved occupations  was  smuggling into Esthouia. fromRussia  Bolshevik agents  on their way further afield.  The  EsthonianMinister of the Interior stated in  the House that the 61  Communistsrecently deported  to Soviet Russia had participated in or connived at the subsidies to Esthonian Communists,  who received their instructions fromAuvelt,  Chief  of the Esthonian Communist Party  in Soviet Russia,through the couriers  of the Bolshevik  Delegation.   There Avas  alsodocumentary proof of the Delegation^ intentions  to establish communistorganisations  in  Esthonia  and supply them with  arms,  and to payEsthonian  workmen Avages, during  the  recent  strike, from  a fund  inPetrograd.  The statement  was doubtless intended to  be  striking,  butthere appears to be little doubt that the Soviet Delegation engaged in thepreparation of a revolutionary movement Avhich was to have taken placein connection Avith a general strike.                             LATVIA.   It  is  reliably  reported  that  Finland  AVill shortly  recognise Latviade jure.  The  discovery of  an important Bolshevik  organisation with many outlying branches led  to a considerable number of arrests at Rigaand elsewhere, and  33 stamps  of all the local institutions  were found,excellently carved in  wood, as  well as  copies  of  signatories,  Avhichenabled the organisation to  provide  its  agents with papers  giving themfree access everywhere.   A Ukrainian Red Cross Delegation, under the direction of  a Jewess,Rayevskaia, Avho  was in touch with the Soviet Peace Delegation at Riga,Avas found, Avhen making its  Avay to Latvia from Russia, to be carrying15,000,000 kroner from Dzerzhinsky  and sent for propaganda abroad.   The mission of Fuerstenberg-Ganetzki, the recently appointed SovietMinister in Riga, is to organise the commercial exchange of  the western european Bureau, and  also  a &quot; valuta bureau,&quot;  to secure for the SovietGovernment the foreign securities of  which they stand in such need.   On  a  protest to the Latvian Government  by  the Bolsheviks  theformer  have been obliged to  expel Count Palleu, who has been organisingWhite forces in Latvia to operate against Soviet Russia.                           LITHUANIA.   The precarious situation  of  Lithuania as regards  Poland has led toa general tendency toAvards  a rapprochement  with Germany, especially on the  commercial side.  The economic situation of the  country is  not good.  Lithuania is  almost  entirely  dependent on markets  abroad, andthe number of industrial  workers within her borders is  small.  these workers  appear dissatisfied  Avith their  wages,  but not  yet prone  toBolshevism,
                               POLAND.  Popular Opinion  and the Bolsheviks.     Polish opinion, elated by successes, appears to be in favour of handing  on  the torch  to  tho associates  of  General Wrangel, and of giving  all  &apos;  support to anti-Bolshevik activities from whatever quarter.  The news  of  the armistice  was everywhere  received with  satisfaction  largely  mingled with distrust of  its validity and that of  any undertakings on the  part of Soviet Russia.  It has been known since early in September that  the French and American Missions  in Poland have been in  close  touch  with  General  Wrangefs representative,  aud  have  been  using their  influence with the Poles  to induce them to enter into an agreement with  General Wrangcl&apos;s South Russian  Government.   As the armistice has  intervened  the only  way for the  Poles  is  through U.  Savinkoif and  General Balakovitch.     Meanwhile the economic  situation grows  steadily worse.   Wages have  been raised three times  within  the month.   The Entente, and especially France,  are  blamed for.  the  high prices  and the fall in the Polish currency a circumstance which, however,  does not appear likely for  the present to  attain to political significance.   The temper of the Poles  manifests itself also in  their preferential treatment  of  anti-Bol- shevik Russian prisoners  as compared with Communists, who are described as  living  in   conditions  of filth and privation.  Repressive  measures against the agricultural labourers reported to have assisted the Bolsheviks during their brief period of occupation are the  cause of  considerable trouble, and have even led to threats of a general strike.    In  contrast to this severity is the report  that the armistice  negotia- tions at Riga  culminated in  a secret treaty between the  Poles and the Russians, whereby the Poles were to obtain  large timber concessions  in return for waiving  their  claim upon Bolshevik  gold. Whether, if true, this would really  be inconsistent  with the trend  of Polish  policy  is difficult to discern.   It would  leave  Russians more gold for propaganda elsewhere, and would also be a sign of Polish belief in the^continuance  of the  Bolshevik  regime.  On the  other hand,  supposing  the Poles to be entirely sceptical  as  regards  the reliance  to be  placed  upon  Russian promises, the understanding might be merely a mask to  cover the reality of their anti-Bolshevik dealings with Generals Balakovitch and Wrangel.    A reliable informant who has  recently returned from Poland describes the financial situation  as  lamentable.  The police  have lately taken to making levies  on landowners.  In one case our informant was  present when the local surveyor of taxes, formerly a postman, came  and demanded a contribution of 150,000  marks.   The landowner  had promissory notes for far more than this sum, and tendered these notes  in payment.  The man would not accept them, and took eight cows and six horses instead. Our informant  thinks  that Poland will not go Red, and relies upon the Polish inertia to keep them safe.   Plebiscites, he thinks,  are a farce.  He  saw one of these Plebiscites in Czecho-Slovakia.   When a  peasant was asked whom  he wished to be under, he said &quot; England  and France.&quot;  He was  told the Allies did not come into it, and that he had to choose between  Czecho-Slovakia and Poland.  He said : &quot; We do not want to be either.  We will just  beourselves.&quot;   Speaking of the military prowess   of these people, our informant saidthat he knew for a  fact that when the Germans  found the Roumanianswere afraid of  machine guns  they equipped the whole of the front-linetrenches with police rattles, and, at  a given moment, all  the rattles were
turned on and the Roumanians ran away.  Ho said it was much tho samebetween  the  licds and the Poles.  During  tho  great Russian  advancethere were no  hostilities which  could  ho called more  than skirmishes.At one place  there was reported  to bo  stubborn  fighting  for three days.Our  informant was  present  for two  of them.   He  saw  three deadBolsheviks and two  dead  Poles.  The Poles were  so  proud  of theircasualties that they left the bodies lying on tho road for a week.   Duringthe hottest of the lighting a good many ladies drove out to tho front line in cars.   The Poles did a certain amount of damage with a battery, whichfired on the town for a good  many hours, but the battery was posted in front of the infantry, within 600  yards of  the enemy, and yet sustained no casualties.  Our  informant, who was in  British  uniform, saw thousands of Bolshevik prisoners.  They were, in fact, a great nuisance, becausethey would come  and surrender to him.   They went about asking people to take  them  prisoner and  give  them  a  meal.  Two units,  of  about1,000 men  each, composed entirely of Communists, did really fight.  Thoregimental Commissars he  described as rather fine-looking men.   Theywore a red star and two red  pom-poms over  the ears of  a conical cap.The Poles  killed  them whenever they fouud  them, aud  some were killedby the  men  of  their regiment.  Apparently their  duty was, besidespropaganda,  to provide food, and Avhen this was not forthcoming theCommissars became  unpopular.  On the whole, however, our informantsaid the fighting was a farce.   If a Pole  happened  to get up to stretchhimself the Beds  disappeared in  a  flash, and  vice versa.  Our informantcould never  understand why the Poles  retreated to within  8  miles ofWarsaw.   If they had stood  their ground and  fired  once  or twice theReds would have vanished.Galicia.    In their Polish policy Germany and Russia  occupy common ground,though facing different ways.  The creation  of a Galicia &quot; independent &quot;of Poland  appeals to them  for different reasons : to Germany for reasons connected  with what she regards as the irredentism of that province, andto Russia both on account  of the weakening of  Poland and because allsmall &quot;independent&quot;  countries offer an excellent field for communist propaganda.    It  is  a striking testimony  to the present  standing ofEngland in European  policy that  both Germany and Russia  are  agreedthat nothing can  be done for  Galicia without English consent.    During a recent interview  with a Galician envoy named  Nazaruk,Litvinoff  promised  the  support of  Soviet  Russia  to an  independentGalicia, provided this consent  were obtained.  With Germany, on the other hand, the younger generation of Galicians are engaged in conversa- tions, apparently initiated by  the  German Foreign  Office, regarding German support to a Galician  rising  against the Poles.   A subsidy of 900,000 marks monthly for a period  of several months  has been hinted at as necessary for the preparation of a rising, aud  the secular  hatred of the Galician for the Pole  is receiving German  encouragement.   Funds for  the  purpose are also  being raised  among  Galiciau immigrants  in America and  among the Czechs, who  strongly sympathise with Galician aspirations and are offering to  supply arms  and munitions  on  payment. Young men who are making  their way hope to break with the Poles and to establish Galician independence without foreign assistance,    The whole movement  is  indefinably  monarchist.   In this connection the name  of the Archduke William of Hapsburg, who naturalised himself as the  Ukrainian,  Vassil  Vyshyvany,  and is now  a  colonel in the Ukrainian army, is mentioned.
      5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.                             GREECE.   M. Venizelos&apos;s defeat lias created a situation of the utmost gravityboth for Greece herself and for  the Entente policy in the Near East.Reactionary papers in Germany are. openly  exultant, and  the  blow toliberal institutions  and influences in the Balkans will in Moscow  bowelcomed exceedingly.  The  most direct  of  the  political consequenceswill - probably be  traceable  in  Asia  Minor, where  the   Nationalists,relieved from the possibility of pressure,  will feel  themselves more  than ever justified in stretching forth their bauds to the Bolsheviks.The Royalists.   The  death of  King  Alexander  created  a situation of considerabledifficulty for M. Venizelos.  Prince  Paul&apos;s reception of the offer of the succession clearly showed that young man to be entirely under the influence of the ex-King Constantine and Prince George.  His reply to the offer ofthe crown,  though  probably foreseen by M. Venizelos, was intended to cause the latter the maximum.of embarrassment.    In the country  M. Venizelos&apos;s  position  was believed to be very strong,and a large majority for his Party  at the coming elections Was generallyanticipated.    Violent propaganda was being  carried  on  before the King&apos;s death by both Royalists and Venizelists.  The Communist  Party was also  busywith  meetings and  demonstrations, for  which they were being supplied with  funds both by the  Greek  Royalists  and Italian Socialists.  to ex-King  Constantine himself extremely contradictory  policies  wereattributed.  On the one hand, it was said that if the Greek people choseVenizelos he would not hesitate to collaborate with him, because as  Kinghe must forget the past.   On the  other hand,  it was reported that ifRoyalist propaganda, which he had  been  financing, was unsuccessful he might urge the Constantinists to withdraw from the elections at the last moment and  organise  a  coup  cfetat  involving the  assassination ofM. Venizelos,  Moderate politicians had  long  been  working for an understanding between the Venizelists and the  Constantinists, and insuch  quarters the belief was expressed  that  the  coming elections mightbe followed by  the return of the ex-King.  It was  strongly rumouredthat  M. Venizelos&apos;s sympathy  with the Republicanism  of the LittleEntente was on the point of leading Greece to join it a policy for whichhis possible collaboration in the near future with King Constantine mightsupply  an  additional motive.    There is no indication of Bolshevik agitation in Greece.                           YUGOSLAVIA.    The hope which was  entertained by Croatia, when she joined  theSerbs in 1918, that her commercial and economic prosperity would ensurefor her the position of prima  inter pares in  the new triune kingdom hasnot been  realised.  Dislike  and  fear of  the Serbs seem to be  the maincharacteristics of  Croatia to-day.   As may be imagined, no opportunitiesare lost by Hungary aud  Italy to fan this flame by means of  agents audpropaganda.
    The Communist  Party in  Croatia has made rapid strides in the last two years, though it is perhaps  true  that they havo been considerably helped  by the votes of  those who, while  not Communists, are  disgusted with all other parties and the continued high cost of living.    At  the municipal elections  in  Zagreb (Agram) last March  tho Com- munists secured  20 out of 50 seats on  tho council.  The Government party only secured   15 seats, and  the Communists  promptly claimed the right to  appoint  the representative  to  the burgomasters  chair.  The Croatian  Provincial Government  intervened,  declaring  all the  Com- munist  mandates null and void, aud hold afresh  election in July, with the result that  13  of  the Communist  seats  were recovered by  the Government no Communist, of course, being allowed to stand.    Subsequently, the Communist Party suffered a split within  its ranks, aud now consists of  a moderate and extremist section, whose strongholds are the  towns.    Although  the   Croatian  Communists  stand   for  an  independent Croatian  Soviet  Republic,  they  stress the Nationalist rather  than the Internationalist phase of their programme.  Iu  this they are at one with the Croatian Peasants&apos; Party, which, though at present neither very large nor important, aims  at an independent Croatian peasant republic.    The Government express confidence in their ability to deal with both Communists  and revolting peasants, but  are at the same time anxious about Bolshevik propaganda among the troops.   Though Yugo-Slavia is as little Jikely as any country to fall a victim to Bolshevism it has always felt sympathy with Russia, and is unlikely ever to fight  against the Bolsheviks.   Its  prosperous peasantry, unless swept  off its  feet by propaganda, an  eventuality which must always be taken into  account, cares little for  Bolshevism.  The uncertain condition of  the country is aggravated by the delay in settling the frontiers,  which renders it easy for Hungarian  and  Italian agitators, aud Bolshevik  agents  to gain an entry.                            BULGARIA. Democrats and  Agrarians.    The stability of  M. Stambolisky&apos;s agrarian  government is described as very uncertain.   While it has increased its hold upon the  villages its drastically radical measures in appropriating property without sufficient reason or  excuse have  earned  for it the distrust of business men, and have caused great uneasiness and discontent in commercial and propertied circles.  Many  Bulgarians are reported  to  be  endeavouring to protect their property under cover of British ownership.    The result of M. Stambolisky&apos;s  visit to England is  being  awaited with great interest.  Should the outcome be disappointing his prestige and influence will, it is believed, decline still more.  Only a successful issue of  his negotiations in London can, it is thought, lighten the many afflictions  under which Bulgaria is labouring.    The lev, normally an equivalent  of the franc, uow  stands  at about 300 to  the  , and lack of  currency, due  to  hoarding by the peasants,remains  a serious obstacle to the  resumption of normal  enterprise.Economic  instability has  been emphasised  by  the manipulation  of  themoney market by Jews, and considerable  purchases in Constantinople byBulgarian  merchants.    Meanwhile  the   Democratic  Party  is  taking advantage,  of   theGovernments dilemma, the sensible decline in  Stambolisky&apos;s  prestige,
arid  the  uneasiness  in  commercial circles to drive a wedge into theAgrarian  Party.   Should  it   succeed  and  a  Democratic  NationalAmalgamation  come  into  power, problems  of  finance  and commercemight  be  better handled,  but  the productive  elements of the country,represented politically by the Agrarians  and Communists, would  be sotup against the traders of the bureaucracy, so forming a liue of cleavage,dangerous both to  the  country itself and  to  the interests of the AlliedPowers.   Recent bye-elections of municipal  and communal  councillors,hotly contested as  they were by the Communists, have, however, on thewhole strengthened the position of the Agrarians throughout  the country districts,Communists.   A Congress of  the General Workers&apos; Syndicalist Alliance was  heldin Sofia on 26th to 28th September.  It  was stated at this meeting thatall the Left  Section of the Broad Socialist Party in Bulgaria were nowjoining the Narrow  Socialists, aud  that the  Broad  Socialists were not expected to survive the split in  their party.   The Sub-Bureau  of the Third International in Amsterdam has been invited to send delegates to a  Congress of Communist Teachers, whichis to be held  in Sofia towards  the end of  October next.  Wynkoop hasdecided to send two Dutch representatives whose  names have not yetbeen ascertained.                           ROUMANIA.   Even by the persons who favour social revolution most of  the chances of it in Roumania are described as very small,  and as having diminishedsince the check of  the Red Armies in  Poland.  The agrarian populationof small landowners have everything  to lose by adopting  the Sovietsystem.  The army,  further, is  believed to be both  loyal and well  paid.Extremists in Roumania have lost confidence in Moscow and are turningto the west for guidance.  They have  fallen back  upon the policy of trying to set up the small  landholders against the  owners of the  largeestates, whom they say the Government is protecting, and take refuge incriticisms of Government firmness in  suppressing strikes in the essentialtrades and industries pending compulsory arbitration.   The general strike  declared  on 21st  October   ended in  complete failure.  It was preceded  by an  ultimatum by the  labour syndicates tothe Prime Minister, demanding (1) Abrogation of the new Labour Bill,whose purpose is above indicated ; (2) Discontinuance of military controlill factories aud workshops ; (3) Abolition of censorship ;  (4)  Recognitionof labour committees;  (5) Discontinuance of deportations of foreignworkmen from the new provinces ; and  (6)  The fulfilment  of Govern-ment promises for the revision of the scale of wages.   The failure was partly due  to the precipitation  of the  raihvaymen,who came out before the  other unions  and thus gave the  government an opportunity of dealing with them separately.  But the movement washalf-hearted in all  industries and State services.  By 27th October it hadcompletely collapsed.  The Roumanian Government  holds documentaryevidence,  which it believes to  be conclusive, that  the  strike had the encouragement  and  connivance  of  the  Soviet authorities.  GeneralAverescu is, however, reported to have carried firmness too far and nowto be compromised in the eyes of public opinion on account of the drasticmilitary measures which closed, and even to a certain extent (as is shown by the ultimatum of  the labour syndicates) provoked, the strike.
                 6.  NEAR EASTERN STATES.                             TURKEY.   . The Crown.    Before their recent success in Armenia and the fall of M. Vonizelos the  Nationalist Government was  in  a  bad way.  Practically its only source of revenue was 200,000 pounds Turkish from the Eregli coalfield. In despair at its embarrassments its members fell a ready prey to assiduous hints that Bolshevism was  the  only thing to  save the country from the &quot; rapacious and predatory &quot; Entente.  Differences of opinion among the Nationalist leaders in Anatolia were  acute.  There were  three  distinct parties :  the Unionist  wing, which favoured the integral  acceptance of Bolshevism ; the anti-Bolsheviks,  animated by the traditional Turkish fear and  detestation of Russia ;  and the Nationalists of Mustapha RemaPs personal  following, who feared complete surrender would become necessary unless they obtained outside help, and who wrere unwillingly inclining to get into  line with the Unionists in negotiating an agreement with the Soviet Government.  The possibility of Talaafs return to Anatolia was mooted, but his presence  in Europe  is considered very important, aud Kiazim   Karabekir,  now the victor of Alexandropol, was regarded as Mustapha Kemal&apos;s possible  successor, though  the name of Euver Pasha was also suggested.    Bolshevik relations  with the Young Turks were not entirely without points of  difficulty.   Negotiations  between  the  Bolsheviks  and the Turkish  Delegation  at Moscow wore complicated by proposals on the part of the Bolsheviks that  the Khalif aud the  Sheikh-ul-Islam should be chosen by popular election ; that the principle of Evkaf property should be extended in its application ; and that other administrative departments should profit from Evkaf revenues ; that  women should be put upon an equal footing with men, and the wearing of the  veil left to individual choice; and  that  the  ownership  of  property should be limited.  An agreement  was finally signed, and there  appears now to be no doubt that the promised Moscow forces will arrive sooner  or later through Armenia to strengthen Mustapha Kemal in his-resistance to the application of the Treaty of Sevres, although the  Bolsljeviks  may distrust him on account of his real though carefully suppressed antipathy to Bolshevik principles.    Early  in September a  Bolshevik Committee consisting of Victor Schlegel, Arthur Nuschke, and a Russian named Rudnieski, together with a number of Turks, was formed  iu Constantinorjle.   The Committee was reported  to maintain correspondents in Anatolia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia.    The effect of the Greek elections upon Greek military policy in; Asia Minor is  not calculable from the  information at our disposal.  It  has been  reported that the Greek  troops as a whole may  be withdrawn. Reports from Brusa have been indicating  that  those in that district are well disciplined,  and  that  the  Greek  occupation   is  not  altogether unpopular  with  the inhabitants.   The Greeks are  said to  have been treating the natives well.   It was reported, on the authority of Reshid Pasha, that Italy, convinced that the balanceof power in the Near East depends on the existence of an independent Turkey within  its national frontiers, is prepared to give Turkey all  the assistance she requires for her material reinstatement.                             EGYPT.   The dominating interest in Egypt during October  was the discussionof the Milner-Zaghloul  agreement,  which, while it satisfies the moderates
and the landowning  classes, as persons who, on the whole, would stand to benefit  by the arrangement,  has  failed  to  conciliate the  Watanistextremists.  The latter have  been  busy filling the minds of  the nativeswith suspicion that they are being morally &quot;dragooned &quot; into submission to the old leaven of the Turkish pashas in  Egypt aud  on  the Continent.The  extremists have, in  fact, been very active since the departure from egypt of the members of the Zaghloul  Delegation, and members of theWatanist  Party, both  in Berlin, in Paris, and  in  the entourage of theex-Khedive are bent on creating trouble in  Egypt if  complete indepen-dcnce is not granted.   Under these  influences Zaghloul and certain ofhis companions are afraid  to  sign.   They now contend that the agree-meiit  does not really  involve  any change from  the  Protectorate,  and demand its formal abolition by the  British Government.  Pressure fromwithout emphasises  their  demand for  explicit  assurances regarding theagreement, which  Great Britain, for strategical and other  reasons, is notin a position  to give.  The Delegation desire to limit  very precisely thefunctions, both actual and consultative, of the Financial and  JudicialAdvisers, and to reduce these functions to the spheres of activity of each,thus making aWay, with a  stroke of the pen, with the informal influencesand advice of which the British Government in Egypt has  hitherto solargely  consisted.  The Delegation has also objected  to  the ratificationand coming into force of the Treaty being deferred until foreign Powersshall  have  transferred  their  rights  under the capitulations to  GreatBritain.   The situation is,  in fact, full of perplexity.  It is possible that thehands of Lord Milner would  have beeu  strengthened if there had notbeen such entire reasonableness in this country as  regards the  necessityof meeting the Delegation half way.   The door for negotiation is not yetclosed.   Should the London  discussions come to  an end, however,  a recrudescence  of  nationalist activity  and  intrigues  in  Egypt  and in countries harbouring Egyptians is almost certain.   The present situation is, indeed, due  in  no small measure  to  such activities in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Asia  Minor.  ImBerlina section of the Egyptian Nationalists, under the notorious Sheikh AbdulAziz Shawish, have been doing all in their power to upset the negotiations,and early  in October  were sending comminatory telegrams to Zaghloulaccusing him of squandering time and money, and  asking him what hehad to say in his defence.   In Paris the Nationalists  have been takingthe advice of experts in  International Law, of whom one, M. CharlesDupuis,  professor of  that subject  in the University   of  Paris, has expressed the opinion that  the Milner scheme limits Egypfs sovereigntyat every point where a protectorate  limits the sovereignty  of a  protectedState,  and contradicts the aim to establish Egypt as an  independentcountry.  The  quite un-Egyptian clarity  of the objections raised  is in keeping with the  analytical qualities  of  the French  mind, and it is not impossible  that France, which  is coming to regard its interests in theEast as  in many  ways opposed to those of Great Britain, may not beindisposed  rather  to  augment than to diminish British  embarrassmentsin Egypt.   Dissatisfaction with  the  terms  also  predominates amongEgyptian extremists  in  Switzerland.   Here, it is true,  there  is  semeconflict of opinion.   Some  say that  it  will  be  the best policy to acceptwhat has been granted, gradually to consolidate the Nationalist position,and ultimately to expel  the  English  from the Canal zone altogether.The more extreme element, however, argues that to allow the English anystanding will ouly result  sooner or later in their finding some excuse fora inoccupation.  In Turkey the Sultan, despite pressure  to the contraryfrom Egyptian Nationalists, has definitely dissociated himself from the
  Egyptian  movement.   Tho ex-Khedive, on the other hand, favours tho  policy of tho Watanists, and is reported to be bent on  creating trouble  in Egypt  in default of complete independence.   Abbas II. is reported  to bo at present iu high fettle, aud  it is thought that he would &quot;not  be  unwilling  to return to Egypt as Sultan, even if the modified autonomy  suggested  in the London discussions were accepted.  The whole question  will be discussed during November  at a Pan-Islamic Congress  to be held  in Asia Minor, delegates to  which, almost  certainly  of tho extreme  Nationalist complexion, are to be chosen at a  meeting shortly  to be held  at Diekirch, in Luxemburg.  One Egyptian  Nationalist  meeting has  already been held at Diekirch on 5th October, and, on receiving the news  of the  agreement of the  Sultan of Turkey  to  ZaghlouPs  acceptance  of Lord Milner&apos;s  terms, passed a motion of confidence in ZaghlouFs  Delegation, and despatched telegrams embodying that motion to Cairo,  Paris, Berne,  Lucerne, and  Berlin.   This meeting also  decided  that  Nationalist propaganda should cease, and that the Nationalist Party should  Avithdraw its support from  strike  movements  in Egypt.   Attention was  called by  Ahined-Ali-Reshid-Bey to the  poverty of Nationalist funds  as compared with the  huge British  capital invested  in Egypt.   The  presence of British capital in Egypt was the main reason, he contended,  why  the majority of the  rank  and file could not  be  made  to adhere  whole-heartedly to  the movement,  as  it  depended  largely on  British  commercial activity for its subsistence.     There has been a  renewed epidemic of strikes in Cairo and Alex-  andria,  due to  the  activities of agitators rather  than to any acute  grievance.     Abdel Rahman Bey Fahmy has been found guilty of both offences with,  which he was charged in the Vengeance Society conspiracy case.  Only four out  of  the  29  persons accused, were  acquitted. The verdict  was received in profound silence, which, as shortly appeared, denoted anything but acquiescence.  The  sentences have not yet been pronounced.  The counsel for the defence is  contending that  the papers of the trial should be sent to the Judge Advocate-General  in London, while the authorities, it is alleged, desire to hand the papers  to  the Deputy Judge Advoeafe- General  in  Cairo.   The Military Authorities  are  reported to be con- sidering further prosecutions, and  to be in possession of sufficient evidence of  another  conspiracy.   Those likely to be accused are  not prominent persons, and the charges,  if laid, will  be  in  the nature of publishing seditious and threatening circulars.   It is improbable that any decision to prosecute will be taken before the  announcement of the sentences on the original gang.               7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.                          THE CAUCASUS.    Turkish  Bolshevik domination of the  Caucasus  has  been  obtained in face of the increasing hostility to  the Soviet regime on  the one hand and of sturdy resistance to Pan-Islamic influences on the other.    In general auy anti-Bolshevik movement appears for  the present  to be  impossible.  The  Independence  of  the Caucasian  Tribesmen  was contingent  upon the success, or  at least  the  avoidance of defeat, by General  Wrangel.  Their  ardent  desire for an Independent  Northern Caucasian Republic is not likely to die, however.    Numerous anti-Bolshevik disorders  were taking place  as  early as August of this year, and had by that time necessitated the  despatch oftwo divisions to quell them ; while Turkish attempts to stir up enthusiasmfor  the Kaliphate were reported to be unsuccessful.
404                           ARMENIA.   Red Russian and Young Turk  collusion  has  struck what appears tohe a final blow at the liberty of Armenia.   On 17th October the Soviet Government presented an  ultimatum tothe Armenian Government, of which the clauses were :    (1) The Armenian Government is  to allow free  use  of its railways         by  tho  troops of the Russian Soviet, Azerbaijan Soviet, and         the Turkish Nationalist Government.   (2) The Armenian Government is  to deuounce the treaty of Sevres         and break off diplomatic relations  with the Entente powers.   (3) Armenia is to submit her  territorial  dispute with Turkey to the         arbitration of the Russian Soviet Government.   This ultimatum  the  Armenian Government rejected.  immediately thereafter  the Turks fell upon them, and  attacks delivered by a  force under Kiazim Kara Bekir in  the early part of  October  reached the outskirts  of Kars, Kacizman, and  Igdir, and were  then brought to a stand.  Turkish  reinforcements, however, came up, and on 28th october the advance was  resumed.  Kars fell  on 30th October.   Armenia was brought to her knees aud forced  to ask the Turks for terms, which will.doubtless include  the  right of passage along  her  railways for  bothBolshevik and Nationalist  troops as required.   Thus will  be swept away the  last material obstacle between turkey and Russia.  An obstacle of a spiritual kind still  remains,  however, andthe mutual distrust of the two parties  may still have consequences.   Itwould be idle, however, not to fear the results of  the conjunction of thesinister forces of  Bolshevism,  and the  Young  Turkish  Nationalists,coupled with  the  withdrawal of  Greek pressure upon  the  latter, which m. Venizelos&apos;s defeat  seems likely to entail, or to attempt  to deny thata situation of the utmost gravity has arisen in Near and Central Asia.                          AZERBAIJAN.   Bad organisation and damage by floods has impoverished the harvestsin the  Baku  area.  Ostensibly  under  the  leadership of NarimanofF, theGovernment is really controlled by the Extraordinary Commission com-posed entirely of Russian Bolsheviks.   Relations  between the MoslemCommunists and the Russians are gradually becoming  more strained a fact  which the  Russians are  beginning  to  realise.   Zinovieff,  whoattended the conference  at Baku, is reported to have told Moscow thatthe position in Azerbaijan is far from sound.  He advocated the dismissal of the Moslem Communists and  an increase of terrorism.                            GEORGIA.   The Bolshevik authorities have  established  their own Consulate inBatum, where they have opened a political  department, which works  inclose touch with the KirofF  Mission in Tiflis.  Although this Consulateis  ostensibly for the  purposes of  issuing passes for those who wish toproceed to Soviet Russia, its main activities  consist  in Bolshevik propa-ganda and the  sending in of reports on military questions, such as thestrength of the Georgian forces, &amp;c.   Various Communist centres have
been founded in Georgia, and these are being liberally supplied with funds and literature by tho Soviet Consulate at Batum.   In  spite of the  efforts of tho Bolshevik representatives to spreaddissatisfaction throughout the  country, there is reason to believe thattheir propaganda, at any rate in the  Batum  Province, is  meeting with little or no success.                 8. FAR EASTERN STATES.                              CHINA.   The Communists are reported  to  be carrying on a strong propaganda campaign among  the Chinese, and are training 600 Chinamen for thispurpose.   They are  reliably stated  to be sending  enormous quantitiesof literature iuto China.&apos;  The  agitation appears  to  make most progressin the south.   The Bolsheviks  are at present&apos;negotiating  with Sun-Yat-Sen.   a doctor Li, described as a very  important Chinaman  in  Peking, is  amember of the Central  Soviet Executive Committee, and Volodin, of  theMaximalists, has been sent.to Canton as Bolshevik representative.  OneMinsker,  a  Communist, plays an important role as regards Bolshevikagitation amongst Mussulmans.   A Chinese Military Diplomatic Delegation headed by  General TsanSi Lin  has arrived at Moscow.   Though without official status  theopening of normal political and trade relations between Russia and china is reported to be its  object.   A memorandum  setting forth  the  conditions for the conclusion of  apolitical  treaty between the two  countries has  been  presented  to  theChinese  Government through  General assistant  Si  Lin   by the  SovietGovernment.                            SIBERIA.   Before his reported departure from Chita with what was  left  of theKolchak  gold, Semenoff, having offended the reactionaries, the democrats,and the Japanese, had  broken with  them all,   It seems, therefore, thathis part  in Siberian politics was likely to be  restricted,  aud  in some quarters it was said  that he might even not be  disinclined to offer  his services to the Bolsheviks.   From  a  reliable  source it was  reported,  late in  August, that theJapanese had come  to an  agreement with the Verchnie-Udinsk Govern-ment, accordiug to.which they were  to  have Saghalien iu return for thewithdrawal of their troops from  the Far East.   This was confirmed byadvices  from an American source, which added  that concessions  to theJapanese  in Kamchatka were  also imminent.   This report  stated  thatthe Americans were jealous of  Japan  and  England, and  believed  that japan was pursuing, on the advice of Great Britain, a  course of actionwhich  is  likely to be successful in  establishing her influence in the far east.   The situation has been carried  one step  further by the concessionsgranted by  the Soviet  Government  on. the  part  of  the. Far EasternGovernment  to  Mr.   Washington  Baker  Vanderlip,  the  Americanmerchant  adventurer.  The  Japanese  have issued  a stronglv  wordednote  stating that they  cannot  recognise the validity  of  the  reportedconcessions, whether made to the representative  of a private syndicate orto  an emissary of the American Government,
                             JAPAN.   Retired military officers are to be appointed as teachers in elementary schools, as the War Minister urges the necessity of military training as abase for children&apos;s education.   The newly founded Japanese Socialist Federation  combines  everyshade of  socialism  in  Japan.  So  far its ringleaders have not beenmolested by the police.  The meeting of a small Socialist group,  theJizn-jin Renmei (Freemen&apos;s League) was dispersed by the police before any business had been concluded.                   9. BRITISH COLONIES.                             CANADA.General.   The situation  as a whole  is steadily improving.   The Extremists ofthe One Big Union are losing heart.   They recognise that Canada is aland of plenty, when  employers can  afford to be  humane, and  whenBolshevik ideas have had little influence upon  the public mind.   Theirhopes are, therefore, mainly fixed upon the effect of labour trouble  in theUnited  States, in Great Britain, and in Europe  generally.   Recentreports indicate the gradual disintegration of the One Big Union underthe growing activities of the I.W.W.   At the Miners&apos; Convention of the One Big Union at Calgary the useof sabotage urged by  the  agitator Christopher  in  the fight  with  theUnited  Mine Workers of America was definitely negatived.  The leadersof the One Big Union clearly intend to provoke  a strike in the westerncoalfields a measure of despair, as they are too weak for a long struggle.It is regarded as not unlikely that they may fail in their endeavour toorganise a sympathetic  strike of railwaymen.  It also appears improbable that the Socialist Party of  Canada would  accept  the invitation to  join the Third International, as the majority of its members consider  such a movement inopportune  at present.Labour.                                       .    The change in the  market has had a steadying  effect on labour, and employers are  in a  stronger position  than formerly ; the men are notnearly so  ready to provoke  conflicts.   The Lumber Workers&apos; IndustrialUnion,  too,  is experiencing  some  decline  in  power  and  possibly inmembership.    The outcome of the Annual Convention of the Dominion Trades andLabour Congress  held at Windsor, Ontario, was a decided victory for theconservative element.  The  Socialistic and Revolutionary discussion of late years was not nearly so prevalent, and the Prime Ministers speechgave the milder type of Radicals much food for thought.  Outside theConvention the &quot;Red&quot; element was active among the delegates, but two men who  bad crossed  over  from Detroit,  U.S.A., in order  to  distributeI.W.W. literature were arrested by the local Immigration Inspector andturned over to the city police.    A  serious attempt is being  made  by the  Associated  Federation ofLabour to  combat the extremist element in the Trades  and LabourCouncil in Toronto.  The first overt move will probably be  made in theBricklayers&apos; Union, the leading labour organisation in the city.
   Only one new strike  has been notified  during  the  past  month  inBritish Columbia.   The United Mine Workers claim a considerable increase of wages audother concessions, but every effort to avert a coal strike is being made bythe Government through the Department of Labour.   The strike of shipping men on the Great Lakes has been successfullybrought to an  end.   The companies  brought in strike breakers, whoeluded the pickets.  Three boats were  able to leave the port, and as thecompany granted a 10 per cent, increase, the men returned to work.Extremists.   Prohibition is being supported by a number of the leading agitatorson the ground that it increases discontent.   It is even reported that the extremists are  trying to induce the Internationals to  take  part in themovement.   The speeches at  a recent public meeting  in Montreal were intenselyrevolutionary, although the ostensible reason  for the meeting was merely to collect money for medical aid for Soviet Russia.  An amusing feature of the meeting was the command of one of  the speakers, on  the groundthat &quot; soldiers of the Revolutionary Army are well disciplined,&quot; that nomembers of his audience  should leave  until the end  of the meeting, oreven speak to his neighbours.   A  small  society, &quot; Plebs  League,&quot; has beeu  started in Toronto  inorder to spread revolutionary  propaganda under the direction of  the ThirdInternational, and is said to be in direct communication with  Moscow.   Charles Lester, a Socialist agitator of Vancouver and a British subject,is reported to have secured about $500,000  by subscription for  a journeyto Moscow, and has  left for  England  en  route for Russia.   Steps arebeing taken to impound his passport when  he arrives.Sinn Fein.   A large, angry crowd gathered outside  the hall in  which the nationalconvention of the Self-Determination for Ireland League was being  heldin Ottawa.   The delegates, numbering 900, from Canada aud Newfound-land, had to be protected by the police from the crowd, who sang &quot; Rule,Britannia,&quot; waved Union Jacks, and  hissed  the delegates  as  they left the hall. A  few stones were thrown.Chinese Activities.   The Chinese Empire  Reform Association,  described  as  an ultra-democratic body, with branches in  the  United. States, Mexico,  Australia,Japan, and Hawaii, is connected with the &quot; Chinese Times,&quot; of Vancouver,where a Chinese  Esperanto school has   also been  established by theChinese  Labour Association.   There are about  100 members.   Theschool is avowedly revolutionary, the text-book  being the CommunistManifesto.   Efforts are being made by the One Big  Union to organise the Chineseat Cumberland, many  of whom  are coal  miners,  but no success  isanticipated,  as  the leaders  are fast  becoming  wealthy through their commercial enterprises.  About $10,000 has  recently been subscribed inBritish Columbia and sent to  China  through the  Chinese NationalistLeague,
Finnish Immigration.   About two-thirds of the Finnish Colony at Fort William are socialists and it is reported  that tho emigration of  revolutionaries from Finland to canada is being actively promoted.  A number of these immigrants havealready arrived in Fort William.                      LEEWARD ISLANDS.   Interest in Marcus  Grarvey&apos;s &quot; Universal Negro Improvement Society &quot;is confined to . young people.  Despite all efforts to attract  investors, noone of any standing has  attended its meetings, or taken shares in  hisBlack Star Line.                         SOUTH AFRICA.The South African Party.   The spread of Bolshevik sentiment and thought among the nativeshas created a situation of  great menace.  In a speech at the opening ofthe Congress of the South African Party, General Smuts discussed theformation  of a United  Moderate Party of all sections of the South Africanpeople in support of the Constitution, and against the Nationalist policy of secession.   He pointed to the  existence  of  a stroug  party  workingdeliberately for political severance, and also of a small but growing partystraining under the  guidance of  Revolutionary  Communism for a social and economic revolution.   He called upon moderate citizens, of whateverrace or party, to return and maintain a strong Government, and to create a true South African nation.The Nationalist  Party.   At a  Free  State Nationalist  Congress held  at  Cape Town  onOctober 22nd the following resolutions were moved by General Hertzog,and adopted as a supplement to the principles of the Nationalist party :    (1) Nationalists acknowledge and will  safeguard  the sovereign will          of the people of the  Union.   (2) They acknowledge the  right of the  people of  the Union to self-          determination.   (3) Also the  right of  the  people to  secede from  Great Britain and          break  any  existing bond  between  the  Union  and  Great          Britain.   (4) Nationalists declare against  and  will oppose  any attempt at a          closer Imperial Union.   General Hertzog declared that  the Nationalists did not necessarilywant to break away from the Empire, but they wished to emphasise their right to secede.  No decisive step should be taken unless a majority ofthe people legally entitled  to vote declared, by means of a referendum orotherwise, in favour of secession.Bolshevik Propaganda and the Native  Population.   Bolshevik  propaganda is  rife among the  natives, and  has recentlybroken out in several rather serious riots.   According to  the  organ of theCommunist Party in South Africa, one of the objects of the  movement isthe organisation of the native and coloured races to co-operate with thewhite workers, seize the powers  of government, and  defend their con-quests by force.  Responsible native opinion,  which  is understood  to mean  the opinion of natives holding offices of emolument connected with    0^AS8486                                                  E
whites, is  reported,  not  unnaturally, (o ho  entirely opposed  to this movement.  One of  the  most serious  of  the  riots followed  the recentarrest  of  the President  of the Native  Workers&apos; organisation  at PortElizabeth,  when a  large  crowd  of  natives,  incited  by revolutionaryspeeches, made a determined effort to roach the police  station and releasetheir leader.   Soldiers reinforced tho police and dispersed the  crowd, but14 persons, including two Europeans, were killed.   The  conduct of thepolice, and their patience  and steadiness, are said to have been exemplary,and  on  the  following day  the  situation  appeared  normal.  The nativeshave, however, been threatening to strike again.                           AUSTRALIA.   The dockers&apos; dispute  with  the overseas  shipping  companies  hasassumed grave  proportions.   The  leaders  still refuse  to accept  theowners&apos; offer unless  they abandon the Loyalist  Workers&apos; Bureau.   Theowners  on  their part refuse to abandon men, chiefly  loyal ex-soldiers,who stood by them in the strike of 1917.  The attitude of  the Dockers&apos;Federation is  likely soon  to lead to serious trouble.   Owners fear thatthey may be compelled to lay up ships engaged in the Australian trade.   The rise of the Farmers&apos; Union Party has been a  notable feature ofthe Victorian  elections.  These farmers&apos;  organisations are becoming a formidable factor in Australian politics.   They have already secured  thebalance of power in Victoria by depriving the Nationalist Governmentof its majority.   In reply to a  question in the House  of Representatives, Mr.  Hughesdeclared emphatically against  any resumption  of trade with  Germany,at any rate for another year,  when he suggests  the matter can  perhaps be reviewed.            10.  UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.General.   Labour disturbances  during  the month havo been  officially reported as practically negligible.  Of the  73  disputes recently  handled  by theConciliation Board, only  11 were strikes; and in most instances definiteagreements were  arrived at between  employers and employed to settle the questions at issue without interference with production.   Political agitation concerning  Great Britain, and the  agitation of theIndustrial Workers  of the World,  together with Sinn Fein, Bolshevik,and German propaganda  are centring in  one set in  New York, which istrying  to make  trouble  between England and the  United States forsubversive ends at home.   Even  by Eugene Debs, the Socialist candidate for the Presidency,now in prison, the Third International  has been sharply criticised.  Hestates unequivocally that his  party are Socialists, not Communists, andthat if the  Third  International  is exclusively  Communist they cannotjoin it.   The Federal Court has confirmed the sentences of from 5 to 20 yearspassed  on William  Heywood, and  93 other  members of the industrial workers of the World.  A number of anti-Bolshevik campaigns organised.by civic organisations are due after the Presidential election.   The Department of Commerce is reported to have under considerationplans for opening trade relations between Soviet Russia and  the  United,States, with an international clearing house at Copenhagen.  The plans
are not yet  complete,  but  an  official  report,  has been made of themachinery established in Denmark for the conduct of  world trade withRussia,The Moscow Conference  of  the Third International  and America.    At the meeting of the International held in July in  Moscow, instruc-tions  were given to  establish  an American branch of the Third Inter-national, having for its object the unification  of the  activities of therevolutionary organisations in the two American continents and further the spread of Bolshevism in the Western hemisphere.  The Internationalpledged itself to afford both moral and material support to strikes, eithereconomic or political.  The money is to be paid  to the  strikers by theAmerican branch of the International, and  every effort is to be made to inaugurate a general strike of workers, particularly the railroad men and miners.  The spread of Bolshevik doctrines to the United States is to be part of a world-wide campaign, which  is not to be limited to the terri-tories of Europe, but  extended to India, Afghanistan, Turkey, Persia,Korea, China, and the Latin-American countries.  It is, in fact, a part ofthe more general campaign against  Anglo-Saxondom.  These activities are to continue in  spite of any  treaties of peace  which  may be signedbetween Soviet Russia and the  principal powers, and without regard tothe re-establishment of economic and diplomatic relations  which may result from these treaties.    On  the  occasion of the  arrest of  White  Schachman,  the formersecretary of Nikolai Lenin, originals of  orders from the  Russian SovietGovernment of Moscow  were  found among his papers.  The arrest tookplace in Chicago during  a raid on Communist headquarters.   Some of theorders are said to have been dated as late as 1st  September 1920, and tohave threatened  death to  any representative of  the Soviet government who revealed its plans, or failed  to  destroy copies of orders  received.One of the documents among those seized  is said to have been a plan to tie up industry through a general railroad strike, in order that the entirenation should fall an easy prey to a revolution.The United Communist and old Communist Parties.    The United  Communist Party, an amalgamation of the CommunistParty of America  and the Communist  Labour  Party,  has secured onlyone-fourth  of the  old  Communist Party, which is  reported to  haveapproached  8,000, including  500 English.   The leaders are alleged tobe  Andrew Stocklitsky (Comrade  Andrew), Nicholas  Hourwich, andBittleman.    The difference between the two  parties lies in their views  upon theform of the class struggle  and the tactics to be employed.  According tothe United Communist party the use of force may or may not be necessaryin order to accomplish  the overthrow of the capitalist state, and  theymaintain that circumstances should be allowed  to dictate the  course ofaction with regard to it.  The old Communist Party, on the  other hand,regard the use of force to  conquer the power of  the State as inevitable,and immediately necessary, and desire to propagate this doctrine amongthe workers.   To this Party the idea of Mass Action connotes an alreadyexistent state of war between the Communist minority and the Capitalistmajority, so that the  Communist minority  must prepare  to seize every opportunity for violent action.    Despite the campaign against him, Comrade Fraina,  of the CommunistParty,  who was receutly present at the second congress at  the ThirdInternational at Moscow, still appears to have the confidence of the Soviet                                                             E 2
 Authorities, and the delegates at the convention of tho Communist Party acquitted  Frairia, Nosowitsky, and  Stocklitsky&apos;  of  tho  charge recently preferred against them of being agents provocateurs.    A  section  of  the Party consider Santeri  Nuorteva is not playing straight, and  cites specific  instances  in his career in which it is alleged he opposed the cause he  now pretends to represent.    There  is  considerable friction  between  the I.W.W. and  the United Communist Party.  Tho former editors of  the I.W.W. newspaper, Eobert Minor and Isaac McBride, have cast in their  lot with the United Com- munist Party, aud  many former anarchists aro showing a tendency towards communism.  A Jewish paper will be financed by  the Party. Labour Troubles.    Strikes are  reported to  be most  frequently called by the &quot; outlaw &quot; organisations of the  Textile Industry, which  are not affiliated with the American Federation of Labour.  These organisations have no member- ship duos, aud are  yet able to employ  a large staff of organisers and even to bribe organisers  of the  Federation  to desert  to  their  ranks.   The source of their funds  is at present unknown.  A struggle of some intensity is probable between alien  clothing  manufacturers  and the   Garment Workers&apos; Union, the  most radical in  the United States.   Employers and employed in this trade are foreigners.  The  slump in the clothing trades has given  manufacturers a  chance to cancel  their contracts  with the Unions  and to  demand new terms, including  piece-work payment, theright  to  &quot;hire  aud fire&quot; without  accounting  to  the  Union, and  scale reduction  of  from 15 to 25  per cent, of  the former  schedule.  the employees  are  summoning  leaders from abroad, in view of the comingfight. Martens&apos; Bureau.   The Department of Justice is reported to be still  anxious  to deport Martens&apos;, but the Department of Labour is said to  oppose sucn action. It is said that important letters bearing on the Martens case, which would have been  invaluable to  the Lusk  Committee, had they been  received in time,  and which  afford  proof of  collusion  between- the Bolsheviks, the Communist Party, and the I.W.W., have only  recently been  shown to the President.  Their concealment  from him  may  have serious official consequences.  The  Soviet authorities, on their side, are said  not to be over-content  with  Martens&apos;  management of  their  affairs, and  to be thinking of  sending  an important   representative  to  investigate1 his activities  in  the   United States  and  possibly even to  supersede him. Martens&apos; agents were reported to be  responsible for the I.W.W. troubles in Philadelphia and the consequent expulsion of a number of members of that organisation.  Martens&apos; Bureau  is further responsible for the escape to Moscow of Fedotov, one  of the American  delegates to the Congress of the Third  International,  who was  convicted of criminal anarchy in the State of  New Jersey, but appealed to the Supreme Court,  and, pending appeal, was released  on bond and employed in Martens&apos; Bureau.-    Two million roubles in  gold, consigned by a firm in  Copenhagen to two firms in New York aud recently  discovered under  a false declaration on board the  S.S. &quot; Hellig Olaf,&quot; are believed  to have been intended for use by the Bureau for Bolshevik propaganda in the United States. Anti-British  Intrigue and  Propaganda.   Mr. Colby, Secretary of State, is reported to have agreed to receive a delegation  which  seeks  to  obtain  American  recognition  of the  irish republic.
    The general meeting  of  tho  National  Executive Council  of Irish Freedom, convened  by de  Valera  to co-ordinate the work of the various Irish  factions in America, completely failed in its purpose.  De Valera did not even succeed in addressing it, and left the meeting in high  dudgeon with his staff.  -    A new organisation, called  the &quot; Friends of the Irish Republic,&quot;  has been formed to support de Valera.  The hopes of  the promoters of  the Irish  Loan  have been somewhat daslfed ;   the  subscriptions to it are reported to have reached only $5,000,000.    The campaign against all things British  is, however, being vigorously prosecuted.   Cardinal  Logue  has been invited to send a  committee of bishops  to  give evidence  or  Irish conditions  before the  committee of One  Hundred on  Ireland, created at  the suggestion of the New York &quot;Nation.&quot;   Mayors of Irish  cities will likewise be invited  to testify before the Committee at Washington.  Interference with British trade is being organised by  the All-American  Brokers, with Albert S.  Feeley, ex-general  manager of  the New York  Life  Insurance Company,  as President.  The programme of this body is to issue lists of big firms handling  English-made goods, in  order that they may be  boycotted by Irishmen and &quot; 100 per cent.&quot; Americans.  British shipping everywhere, and American shipping where it is in touch with British, are to be interfered with.  American-British industries are to be disturbed,  and the wilder spirits  have  even   suggested   that every  British  Embassy should  be destroyed.  Mr. Feeley says that,  though it  is dangerous, bis agents find it effective  to insinuate that the  American  Government is behind this movement.   An Irish Arsenal, directed by one James Magee, exists in the vicinity of West Street, New York, and receives regular remittances of explosives and  firearms from  Krupp&apos;s.   Plans for blowing  up the Consulate and destroying British property after McSwiney&apos;s death were under discussion. It appears, from certain facts which have recently come to light, that there were Irish concerned in the  Wall Street  explosion.   In connection with the arsenal, rifles and ammunition are being bought  by various longshoremen for Mr. Quirk, of the Longshoreinen&apos;s Union, for shipment to Ireland.   Various  anti-British elements in America appear to be joining forces in the Farmer  Labour  Party.   One  of its candidates  for  Congress, Jeremiah  0&apos;Leary, made a  special  bid for the German-Armerican as well as the Irish  vote.  The Party has  formally recognised the Irish Republic and the Union of Russian Workers.   Hindus,  including  Tarak  Nath Das  and  Surendra  Nath  Ghose, notorious  Indian agitators,  have been engaged in organising branches of this Party throughout the States. German-Americans.   German-Americans  and Irish-Americans, although  they  appear  at present to have no general organisation, are upholding a campaign against English interests through the intermediary of  the German Roman Catholic unions and the &quot; Friends of Irish Freedom.&quot;   German Freemasons, intent on winning a real American Government &quot; not receiving and obeying orders from London,&quot; appear  to be organising masonic sympathisers with their fight against English influence.   The German-American  Citizens&apos; alliance for a good government, whoseobject, besides the maintenance of  the German lauguage, culture,  art, and science, is to fight British influences and aid German-speaking emigrants, appears to be spreading rapidly.   The United  Plays Company, latelyorganised, is to swamp  the country with German photo-plays to counteractGerman and English propaganda.
           Former soldiers of  the  German Army havo  at  least one society in        every large American city.  These  societies are centralised in the Nord-        amerikanische Krioger  Bund, which is preparing quietly for the influx        of ex-German soldiers expected after the official signature of  peace with        Germany.  The Krieger Bund sees the advisability of making no overt        demonstrations of German solidarity for the present.  German-Americans        have organised the American Dairy  Cattle  Company  in Chicago,  to        collect cows for shipment to Germany  under  the  auspices of  the United        Society for the Relief  of the Distressed in Germany and Austria.  It is        reported that they expect to send 10,000 heads of cattle during the next        few months.        American Relations with Japan.           The United States alien restrictions are seriously regarded in Japan.           The coal  and  oil concessions granted by the  Far Eastern Republic        to  the   Pacific Coast   Syndicate  representative at  Moscow through\       Mr. Washington Baker Vanderlip, have been the  occasion of  a Japanese        warning to America ; the Japanese stating that, in the absence of official        trade relations between Japan and the  United States, they regarded  the        concessions granted as not worth the paper upon which they are written,        and proceeding to say  that  in  any event they could never  consent  to        concessions of the nature reported.           That  Mr. Vauderlip  visited  Moscow  really  in  the  capacity of  an        American  adventurer  is  confirmed   by the   intense   annoyance   of        Mr. Harding&apos;s party with the  use made by the Democrats  at  the poll of        Mr.. Harding&apos;s letter of recommendation  to  Vanderlip.  Mr. Vanderlip        has just  arrived in this country.   Great  interest is  taken  in  his move-        ments by  the American  authorities, both in this country and in the United        States.           The report that Mr. Vauderlip had  obtained the lease from Lenin of        a 200,000-mile tract of land in  Siberia was  confirmed by Mr. Ludwig        Martens, Lenhrs  representative  in the United  States.   According to        Martens, a telegram from Tchitcherin informed him that Mr. Vanderlip&apos;s        syndicate intends  to lease a portion of the Seattle water-front owned by        the late Czar&apos;s government, and that negotiations  are  proceeding whereby        the syndicate would act as fiscal agents for the Soviet Government in  the        United States, and would be empowered  to finance purchases  up  to         1,000,000.                     11.  CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES.                                    MEXICO.           President Huerta&apos;s treatment  of  revolutionaries and  revolutionary        movements is reported  to be lacking  in firmness.  The  Mexican  head-        quarters  of the Industrial Workers of the World were raided by the police        during August, as were  also the offices  of  &quot; Gale&apos;s Magazine,&quot; which        print for the I.W.W.  and  Communist Party of Mexico.    Samples of        literature Avere taken  aAvay.   The  raid  Avas headed by  one Gabriel        Sanchez  Celi, reported to have been an American  agent in Mexico during        the war.  No arrests Avere made.  President de la JIuerta  aftenvards        summoned members of the tAvo organisations,  and  denied all responsibility        for the raid or intention  of  meddling with  working-class organisations,        Bolshevik or otherwise.  It is not astonishing that, folloAving such  an        exequatur, the activities of the I.W.W. should have been resumed more        vigorously than before.                                          .  ,
    At a Bolshevik demonstration, which took place at the beginning ofOctober, the mob forced their way into  tho National Palace and  thepopulace were harangued  by extremist leaders from the balcony.  Thisagitation is reported  to have been  fomented by foreign  anarchists, buttwo Deputies of Congress also took part.  The speeches consisted largelyof incitation to blow up the  public oifices, to erect barriers in the streets,and to hang newspaper editors.  The reception of  the proposals, however,is reported  to have  been more  encouraging  to  the latter than to the speakers.              12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES.                           ARGENTINE.Political.    A political revolution which  was  to  have matured at  the  end  ofAugust, was  discovered  on  the eve of its outbreak.  Great reticence  isshown by  the  authorities regarding it, but it is known that  the plot wasgiven away by a radical from  the province of Eutre  Rios.   German agents,always willing to do anything  in  support  of  the  President, also laidinformation.   The movement originated among  leaders of the RadicalParty, opposed to the President, Who consider that his departure from the true ideals of that party have brought it to the verge of  bankruptcy, bothmoral and material.   Originally mooted in 1918, the plot was  delayed,among other reasons, because a reaction favourable to the country on thepart of the President was expected.   At last, however, both dissentingradicals and conservatives found the situation unbearable, and resolved toput their plan into execution.    The revolutionaries are now watching the results of the negotiationsfor a better understanding between  the President and Governor  Crotto.The maintenance of  an uncompromising  attitude by the former wouldmean a complete rupture of the  negotiations into which he has  beenfrightened, and will lead  to  a fight to the finish between himself and theopposition, who  have  the  troops  on their side.    The  reactionarytendencies of  the  President are  the cause of  complaint.  He  is  said toput every  possible  obstacle in the way of foreign enterprise, and to  do nothing to assist the economic progress of the country.Strikes and Lockouts.   In order to safeguard  the property of the Forestal Lane, Timber and railways  Co., Ltd., a donation was offered  the  Santa Fe  ProvisionalGovernment for the purpose  of raising and maintaining a flying squadron of mounted  police.   The offer was  accepted and the force  dispatched.Its members, however, were  boycotted by the strikers, and it was feared that, should a general strike  be declared, it would be necessary to  employaeroplanes to keep up communications with the Company&apos;s factories.  Asstores will have to be  kept open to prevent workmen commandeering theCompany&apos;s produce, the strikers will, in fact, get free rations at the expenseof the Company.  Discharged workmen of the Company have asked thePresident  to keep the works open, aud to  take  them  over  should thecompany  refuse,  in  default of which the  men say  they  will  takepossession.   The Mihanovitch  lockout (see report No. 23, page 40) has  crippledthe river service between Paraguay  and the Argentine.  The Presidentof Paraguay has made a personal appeal to the former President of theArgentine to negotiate a  settlement.  The  Presidents tolerance of the
Federation  Obrera Maritima has  led  to  the  sale, by the MibanovitchCompany to a Uruguayan Company, of nine of  the largest  steamers  inthe Argentine  and of  ftvo tug-boats,  thus transferring to Uruguay the supremacy as regards the Mercantile Marine of the  two countries  .    A  stirring  appeal  has been  made by  the  President of La  LigaPatriotica Argentina for aid in combating the anarchist agitators of the cities,  who are  invading  the rural  districts, and are planning an uprisingnext spring.   1,200 brigades  of  the Liga Patriotica Argentina  havealready been formed.    A ship, called &quot;Belluno,&quot; flying the Red International flag, belongingto the Co-operative  Maritima  Garibaldi, is  reported  to  be  the &quot; porte-parole&quot;of the Third  International.   She was  at Montevideo in themiddle of August, and  was  making  a tour  of Bolshevik propaganda,leaving leaflets, &amp;c, aud serving as a meeting place for Bolsheviks where-ever she  called.                            URUGUAY.   The Maximalists have accepted &quot; direct action &quot; of the masses as theonly form of struggle towards a social revolution.  At their meeting  inSeptember immediate  and unconditional  adhesion to the Third  Inter-national was carried by a vote of  1,297 against 175, with 275 abstainers.A public manifestation  of  sympathy with the Soviet  of Russia was prohibited by the police.
PART II.                1. THE SITUATION IN  FRANCE.    A correspondent who recently discussed industrial and social conditionsin France with a number of leading French  and British  bankers therefound a general concensus of opinion that the French working man is now working well and that the  output of  the  country is steadily increasing.That the lethargy aud unrest, due to reaction after tho war and common toall the belligerent nations, have not been of  such long duration in France as elsewhere may be in some measure attributable to  the greater suffering ofFrance in the war and the ever visible  scars which it has  left  upon  thecountry.  But the chief reason for the marked improvement in the situa-tion is  undoubtedly the  firm manner in  which the attempted railway strike last May was  handled by the Government.  French commercialmen viewed  the situation at the beginning  of this year with  considerable anxiety, not to say alarm, as they were doubtful of the manner in whichthe  Government was  prepared  to tackle the  Syndicalist  problem.  the collapse of the railway strike cleared the air.   The Government had theupper hand.   Confidence was re-established, and the industrial situation to-day is far healthier than it was six months ago.  A coal strike at themoment would no doubt be highly inconvenient, but it would be quicklydisposed of by the dispatch of troops and mobilisation  of the  miners.Doubtless local  strikes and  disputes for higher wages will occur fromtime to time,  but  the  workers are earning  good  wages and  makingmoney,  and are consequently contented.    As a set  off to co-operative shops run by the &quot; Syndicats,&quot; the profits of which go  to swell  their  funds, the Creusot works  have establishedwhat is  known as a &quot; Co-operatif Patronal,&quot; that is to say, a co-operativeshop run by the management in which the workmen are the only share-holders.  Cards, however, can be issued to  workmen  from other factories,enabling them to purchase  stores, provided these workmen are  of goodcharacter.  This system is being adopted by other large factories, and ismeeting with a considerable degree of success.    The country as a whole appears to be  going ahead ; working condi-tions in the mines are  good.   In the metallurgical  trades a  certainnumber of hands  are  being  dismissed owing to lack of Avork.   In somebranches of industry there  is over-production owing  to  buyers holdingoff in anticipation of an early lowering of  prices, and this is producing acertain amount of unemployment due to curtailment of output.    The wheat harvest is slightly below the normal, but this is compensated for by the oats, which  are above the  average.  The vintage is  also upto the average in  some districts very good though the recent heavystorms in the south-east and south may have done some damage.    Men in  a position to  judge feel that  the French Government is ready and able to deal with any  revolutionary movement which  may occur.   That this  opinion  is  also reflected in- Labour  circles  can bededuced from the fact that the recent  happenings in Italy do not appearto have had  the slightest effect  on  the French working man.  Moreover,the breaking away of the moderate Socialists from the extreme elements,and the consequent complete control of  the situation by the Government,have enabled  the management in many districts to dismiss agitators a measure which they have  not dared  to  take  for  the past thirty-fiveyears.
    The French Socialist Leaders do not really play a very important partin  French affairs.  It is rumoured, and  this opinion is very generallyshared, that all, without exception, can bo bribed.  There is  no country inthe world where  there is more noise.   There is also  none  where lessnotice is taken of it.  Socialism with a Frenchman is au &quot; expression ofopinion.&quot;  There it remains.   No class in the State intends to translateit into action, as nearly everyone has something to lose.   Bolshevism andSyndicalism, in short, notwithstanding the money expended upon them,are making no headway.  Bolshevism a la Itusse in France is moribundif not dead.    M. Millerand&apos;s election is  regarded with satisfaction by all sectionsof the business community.  He is a strong man, who  knows what hewants, and  his handling  of the railway strike has inspired confidence.M. Milleraud has become the &quot; bugbear&quot;  of the  extremists since his election  to the Presidency of  the Republic, for they fear  that he  will endeavour to dissolve  the party, its federations and sections.    To be fair, it must be said  that M. Milleraud has not yet given anydistinct  idea  of  his  intentions with  regard to internal politics in thefuture, but among Socialists it  is feared that he will initiate a regime  inwhich they would not be able  to pursue their actions freely, and that thePresident will try to suppress the liberty of holding meetings.   It  isreported  that in the course of  intimate conversation with  departmentalprefects he has several times expressed such intentions.    These alleged intentions of the President are partly the reason  whythe Radical  and Radical-Socialist groups  at  the   recent Congress  atStrassburg decided upon following  politics distiuctly  hostile  to  theGovernment  and  to the  National Block  (Centre)  and  tending to  join the Left.    The Badical and  Radical-Socialist groups have  89  members in theChamber of  Deputies and 106 in the Senate.  If these  groups were  toform &quot; Bloc &quot; with the Left the new Bloc would include the RepublicanSocialists, the Federation of the Left, and the dissident  members of theParti Socialiste  Francais.  This  would mean some 260 members  in opposition to the Government, without counting the  69 Unified Socialistmembers, who are systematically opposed to the Governments politics,whether  good or bad, = 329.    The forthcoming session will see  a very big fight between this  newopposition and the Bloc National now in power, which is the representa-tive of  all the big commercial and  industrial concerns and the real estateholders.      2. THE  BAKU  CONGRESS OP ORIENTAL  PEOPLES,                   AUGUST-SEPTEMBER  1920.   In  August  and September a Congress  was held at Baku to rallyOriental peoples to the  Third International against the great Powers,and  especially  England.   There  were  three  meetings at  intervals  ofabout a fortnight.   About 1,800 delegates, including 55  Communists and1,273 representatives of  37 Oriental peoples, are reported to have been present.  The &quot; mediasvalism &quot; of the Eastern delegates and their quaintignorances   contrasted  curiously with  the  cocksure   pseudo-scientificclarity of the western extremists.   According to the Swiss Communist,Jules Humbert-Droz, British ships watched the  Black S.ea coast  to arrest  the  Turkish Communist  comrades,  and Persian  delegates were bombed by  British aircraft at Enzeli, while  the  Indian frontiers werehermetically sealed.             ,                               ...
   The main discussion was the eastern  policy of  the Entente and  theassistance Soviet Russia could  give towards freeing  the colonies of  theEntente Powers.  The principal  Russian delegates were Zinovieff andCarl Radek.  Bela Kun attended for Hungary, Khalil and Jemal Pashafor the Turkish Soviets, Sneevliet for the Netherlands East Indies, andTom Quelch for the  Communist Party of  Great Britain.  During  thefirst  meeting the Russian  delegates,  on behalf of Lenin,  assured  theCongress of the true sympathy of the Soviet Government for Islam, audas proof he cited the restoration of the copy of the Koran which belonged to Khalif Osinau to the Hoja Abdullah Ulajrar Mosque at  Samarkand,whence General Kauffman had removed it in 1819.   There were  pan-Islamic speeches  of the usual type.   The Afghandelegate declared for a state which  would be a protector of Islam to takethe place of the Ottoman Empire, now exhausted by war.  The inferencewas  that Russia should become protector of Islam.   The Russians appear to have handled with some skill the questionof equality, for it was agreed  that the Koran  was addressed  to  everyMoslem without distinction. In short, the principles of internationalismand universal fraternity Avere acclaimed as common to both Islamism  andBolshevism.   In the end it was decided that confederations under  the protection ofTurkey should  be  formed, provided  that  Turkey renounced all pan-Turkish policy, and Russia would co-operate.   There was bitter opposition to England  in particular as regards  thestatus of  native officers in the Tartar Indian army, Avhich was  contrastedunfavourably with  the treatment  of officers  hi the  Russian  army.   Agreat point was made of conciliating the &quot; fanatical and ignorant&quot; Hindus.Once a  real alliance was  achieved and Moslem and Hindu soldiers beatthe British troops  in  India the fate of the British  Empire Avas  sealed.For  this purpose propaganda Avas to go forward.  /It the second meeting,after an impassioned  speech by Zinovieff, the  formation of an Islamicconfederation under a  khalif Avas confirmed.  The khalif&apos;s powers Avereto be  defined by  holy Avrit,  but apparently it was to be  a  limitedmonarchy rather than  an  autocracy.  No sacred qualification was to beattached  to his  person, and it  was the evident intention to replace thepresent khalif by a  nominee of the  Turco-Bolsheviks.    There was one discordant note, and that Avas struck by the delegates of Turkestan, Avho had something to say about the behaviour  of  thecolonists of their own  &quot; Red North.&quot;   One of these delegates  intimated that, having learnt courage from  the  Bolsheviks, the  first enemy theywould take  on would  be Soviet  Russia  itself, for  their  creed was self-determination and freedom for  Turkestan. 3. THE FEDERATED PRESS OF AMERICA:  A PROJECT FOR             AN ANTI-CAPITALIST NEWS AGENCY.   The Federated Press of  America  is  described by its own officials asa co-operative, non-profit-making association of the Socialist, Communist,aud working-class editors of the country.  It aims at a world federationof labour organs varying from those of proclivities extreme Communist andrevolutionary to those of moderate Socialism.   In America the FederatedPress maintains general offices in Chicago at 156, West Washington Street,and has bureaux in New York at 31, Union Square, as well as in Washing-ton and in all the large  industrial cities of the United States, Canada, andMexico. .It claims to control in ali 106 daily and weekly newspapers inthe United  States aud Canada, and two in Mexico.   In Europe the
Federated Press  has bureaux in London,  Paris, Rome, Vienna, Copen-hagen, Christiania, and Stockholm, and will, it avers, within a short timehave bureaux in Amsterdam,  Moscow, and Warsaw.  A  bureau is beingopened in Shanghai, and plans are being made for the opening of offices in South America, India, and Africa.   In Australia, the Federated Press of Australia is being organised, and quite recently  Mr.  E.  J.  Costello,  its managing editor,  came from theUnited States, of which he is a citizen, to England, Norway, Germany,and France, for  the purpose of organising  the revolutionary press  ofEurope in collaboration with the arch-organisers of revolutionary propa-ganda in Western Europe, MM. Litvinoff and  KamenefF.   As regards Mr. Costello\s journey, a word  will suffice.   Early in September he was found to be in  close  touch with Kameneffin London  and Litvinoff in Christiania.   The former described him  as&quot; one of us.&quot;  He  was then  arranging  an agreement with  the &quot; daily herald &quot; whereby  news  selected and  &quot; dressed &quot; to the taste  of  eachcontinent should be exchanged.   In Christiania he made similar arrange-ments with &quot; Del. Socialdeinokratiske Pressekonter,&quot; of Norway, and theRosta Agency, of  Russia,  under  the general  direction of  Mr. Ewer, theForeign Editor of  the  &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;  An American Socialist was tomake  a similar arrangement in Italy with the  &quot;Avanti.&quot;   As it was clear that under the cover of apparently legitimate journalismhe was going as  a  propagandist agent for  Kameneff, a deportation order was served upon him, but he was  not arrested.  He complained bitterlyof this through the pages  of  the &quot; Daily  Herald,&quot;  and a demonstrationwas organised  in New York by his sympathisers when he landed there.        4. THE ASSOCIATES OP  GENERAL WRANGEL.   The signature at Riga of  the peace terms  between Soviet Russia and poland  has created a  situation  for General  Wrangel against  which itwould  have been obvious  folly on  his  part  not to insure.  As far  asacquisitions of  territory are concerned Poland  is now saturated.  Hernationals have been redeemed.  On her own  behalf she can  advance nomotive for further aggression.   .And  yet Polish statesmen  know that under  the  present  RussianGovernment the danger  to their  east  has  scarcely diminished.   TheSoviet Government as  a  government has  been  brought  to  terms.  TheSoviet Government disguised  as  the Third  International  has  not.The distinction  between the two organisations is  more discernible in theory than in fact.  Their directorate is in common.  The International,with  its branches  and organisations  in  all countries,  European andextra-European, is  in  truth the instrument of the foreign policy of theRussian Republic.  The  Poles,  relatively free  from the conspiracy ofcircumstance  which  constrains  President   Mazaryk to  a  policy  of conciliation, have every motive to  keep alight and extend  the  blaze inSouth  Russia, and  to treat at  least with benevolence their successorsupon  General  wrangel&apos;s  left, the future bearers of the anti-Bolsheviktorch.  At  the  same  time they must secure  themselves  against anyregime in Russia which would look askance at their newly-won territories and liberties.   Marshal Pilsudski is not, in this respect, too sure of General Wrangel.In  extending  courtesies  and, perhaps, something  more,  to M.  BorisSavinkoff and  General Bulak-Balahovitch  he  hopes to  balance andcorrect  the  tendency to Tsarism with which, despite all  his democraticassurances, General Wrangel is sometimes  credited.
   The Russian Political Committee under SavinkofTs presidency had its headquarters at  Warsaw  until the  signature  of tho peace terms  atRiga.  SavinkofPs  first corps  is  commanded  by  General Balahovitchand  his  second  hy General  Permikin.   Pilsudski, early this  month,invited  Saviukoff and the Russian  forces, in  view of the signature ofthe armistice  on October 13th, to quit Polish  territory within six days.He offered Savinkoff the choice of facilities and to transfer the Russiansimmediately  either  through   Roumania  to  Wrangel  or,  across  thedemarcation line, into White  Russia.   SaviDkoff decided  on the  lajttercourse,  and left with his staff  for  Pinsk,  where he  was  joined  byBalahovitch, whose army was in  Mozyr.   Savinkoffs  second  corpsunder Permikin  was,  it was  decided, to operate on his right flank, asdesired  by  Wrangel.   Balahovitch  and  Saviukoff would  operate  inWhite Russia,  working north  in  the  direction of Minsk and Vitebsk,and possibly moving further east  into  the  interior of Russia  to districtsAvhere the line of peasant revolts is most distinctly marked.    Pilsudski&apos;s manner towards Savinkoff is said  to have been courteous,and the Russians have no complaint to make against the Polish attitude,which corresponds  with  previous Polish declarations.   Pilsudski offeredSavinkoff all transport facilities in case  he  should elect to move to  south russia.    Savinkoff himself  is not very sure of Wrangel, who, he thinks, afterstarting on the right track, has swerved to the old trodden path.    He issure that unless Wrangel can carry with, him the  sympathy and supportof the peasants and  various nationals  residing in Russia he has  smallhope of success.  He distrusts WrangeFs Council, upon which there are so many adherents to the old regime that  it cannot in his opinion instilfaith into the minds of the peasants.   He has put Permikin in  directtouch with Wrangel  in preference to Balahovitcb, because Balahovitchis,  partly on account  of his peasant origin, democratic, stands  for theretention  of their  land by the peasants, and is strongly in favour of  a federal Russia with  autonomous states.    Balahovitch is therefore incomplete  harmony  with Savinkoff and  the Ukrainian  representatives ofPetlura.    Savinkoffs idea for his advance  is  to  form  a force  of 20,000 to40,000  strong;  to advance  with  this force  into Russia  behind  theBolshevik lines, before the frosts  set in, and organise the  inhabitants ofone district at  a time to  revolt against the Bolsheviks.  There  is no sense, he  thinks, in having a large army and trying to fight the Bolsheviksaccording to  the modern  idea of  war and strategy.  War with  theBolsheviks, in  fact, is not modern, but mediaeval.   A clever report by a french officer  described Koltchak&apos;s retreat on the  Siberian Railway as&quot; tine arrnee fantome poursuivie d&apos;une fantome d&apos;armee.&quot;    Savinkoff holds that a small  force would  be  able  to live  on  thecountry without despoiling it.   He considers that the Russian peasantryare  ready to revolt,  but require  organising.    He has great  faith  inGeneral Balahovitch, not because he is clever, but because of  the naturalintuition  which  seems to  lead him along the right political  lines  to guarantee military success.    Balahovitch has  managed to make himself very popular with  the peasant class, who  look upon him as a general from amongst themselves.Instead of mobilising as he advances, he proposes to demobilise.  Oue ofthe conditions of service with  him is that when a man reaches his nativetown or village he is allowed  to  go  to his home and  family.  The planseems to  work.   Captured Soviet soldiers join  his  forces  and fightexceedingly well, sometimes declining  to be  dismissed ou reaching theirnative place.  During the Polish retreat Balahovitch took the town of
Ovroutch, which was held by 10,000 Bolsheviks.  He sent against thema force of 300 men.  Asked how  ho did it, be said that since half theBolshevik garrison joined his force of 300 and forced the remaining 5,000to surrender, he really had 5,300 men to tako 5,000.    Balahovitch  is so far unbeaten, although his activities  during thePolish retreat were considerably hampered by the necessity of conformingto the movements of the Polish army.   One of the forms  of  propagandahe  adopts  is  the  issue of demobilisation  certificates to  captured Sovietsoldiers,  whom he then releases aud tells they may go back  to  theirnative villages and towns.  The plans of both  SavinkofF and Balahovitchare, in fact, thoroughly democratic.   SavinkofF is prepared to recogniseall  aud sundry so long as they do  not  thwart his plans for Bolshevikoverthrow.  His,  he proclaims, is a purely Russian fight against Bol-bolshevism.   He will allow the peasantry to do as  they please as regardsthe form  of  their local government  until by a general revolt the over-throw of the Bolsheviks has  been achieved.   Then, but not sooner, he proposes  that a Constituent Assembly  should be called  in  Moscow todecide the form of  government  to be adopted.   He has  decided notto join Wrangel at the present  moment, but this decision is due less tohis difFerences with Wrangel than to  his  desire to act as  a link betweenWrangel  and  Balahovitch,  whose  attitude towards Wrangel is  openlynegative.  SavinkofF believes  that Balahovitch&apos;s  enterprise stands  a chance of developing into a wide peasant movement which will materiallyassist Wrangel by  taking the place of the late Polish front.    Immediately  in contact  with  Wrangel  are the  Cossack forces under General  Permikin.  These are now  being reorganised   by the French,General Tronieu having left Warsaw for Rovno.  The reorganisation isexpected to be  complete by the  ratification  of the Riga Armistice  onNovember 10th.   Until then the Cossacks will remain on  the Polish sideof the Armistice line.  The questions  of the continuance of  French aid and the possible leadership after that date are being considered.    Reports from  the  Ukrainian  front state  that  Petlura&apos;s position isimproving, both in  the military  and political sense.  His forces  nownumber about 25,000.   No  difficulties in the way of collaboration withPermikin are foreseen.   The  Ukraine is covered  with a  network ofpartisan  committees ready to rise at a signal  from the  Ukrainian high command.  These partisan  committees, of which  a full  description wasgiven in our  Report No. 18 of April 1920, are naturally supporters of federation in  the  widest  sense of  the word.  Their aspirations in thisdirection have, however,  hitherto  met with little response  in Russiancircles.   The attitude of Deuikin&apos;s volunteer army towards the Ukraine lastyear can  only  be characterised  as one of hostility, and had the effect ofturning a large  proportion  of  Denikin&apos;s  rear against him.  This, it ishoped, the new popular policy of SavinkofF and its influence in steadyingGeneral  Wrangel may overcome.   The Ukrainians  apparently want toget two  points quite clear  before they start.  The first is that they arenot treating with the Russian Volunteer Army, and  the second, that theyare recognised and  accepted  as  supporters  of a  Federative  Ukraine.Should these points be conceded it is believed  that the Ukrainian Army,which has recently sent a mission to General Wrangel at Sevastopol, willconclude  a  purely military  agreement with the Government of south russia, and bind itself to combine with that Government in  joint actionagainst the Bolsheviks  with  a view  to  regulating the question  of  a future political union or federation.  It  is notewortby that  the  missionhas - been despatched to Wrangel  by the  Ukrainian Army, which  is atpresent directed by  the so-called  Central Ukrainian Insurgent  Com-mittee, the representative of the  network of partisan  committees, and
not by General Petlura, tho weight  of whose government in the Ukraineit.is at present exceedingly difficult  to estimate.    Of some interest are the relations of the German Government withWi angel on the one hand and the Ukraine on tho other.
