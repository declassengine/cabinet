All questions placed before the Commission whether by the Councilof the Leatue or by one of the Members of the Commission shall becommunicated by the Secretariat to the Presidents of the Sub-Commissions,The latter, after consultation, will decide according to the natureof the question to refer it either to one Sub-Commission, or two Sub-Commissions whether united or sitting separately, or to the threeSub-Commissions or to the plenary Commission.                         RESOLUTION V.     VJhen the President of a Sub-Commission considers it necessaryto summon his Sub-Commission, he shall fix the date of the meeting and request the Secretariat to summon the members of the Sub-Commissionin question.

                       RESOLUTION VII.   &apos;     The Commission decides that, as a  general principle  the placeof meeting for its future meetings shall be at Geneva,                        RESOLUTION VIII.     The date of future meetings shall he fixed by the  Presidentsafter the- Secretariat has informed them that it has been able  to collect all the necessary information,and when the national Dele-gations have declared themselves ready to discuss usefully thequestions on the Agenda.                        X; ASPHYXIATING GASES *     The questionnaire communicated to the Commission was as follows:     1, Does the experience of the last l/ar, and the Increase in theemployment of gases,author!so us to go back upon the opinion so faruniversally admitted, that the use of this weapon Is fundamentallycruel? mm     2. In cases thoro its employment is permitted,should a limi-tation of the quantity to be used bo imposed in the same way as theproposed limitation for the armies,armamenta and navies authorisedf-or each country?     3* In cases where its employment is prohibited, are there measures-ures in existence to render this prohibition effective&apos;? Vfould Itbe possible,for example, to prohibit experiments in the laboratories &apos;o^ to tako measures whereby, ink a so of war commercial factoriescould be prevented from immediately adapting their manufactures to military purposes?     4. In a general way what opinion would the Permanent Commissionbe able to give the Council concerning international regulationson this matter?                      Opinion of the Commission.     1. The employment of gases is a fundamentally cruel method ofcarrying on warj though not more,no than certain other methodscommonly  employed, provided that they are only employed againstcombatants,   Their employment against non-combatants, however,  mustbe regarded as barbarous and inexcusable,     2.  It would bo useless to sock to restrict tho use of gases inwar time by prohibiting or limiting their manufacture in peace time,     3, The prohibition of laboratory experiments is out ot the question,     4, The throe preceding replies represent tho opinion of thePermanent Advisory Commission on Military and Naval&apos;Technical Questions.     The question as to whether the preparation of an international regulation with regard to tho use of prohibition of asphyxiatinggases should be undertaken is moreover a question of-internationallaw and a problem for humanity,     This question, consequently, is.not within tho competence of a purely technical Commission, which therefore considers that it is not&apos;its duty to supply an answer on this point,     5. If, however,,the Loague of Nations should decide to maintain this prohibition, as drawn up in previous agreements, the Commissionconsiders that an examination into the employment of gases shouldbe authorised so as always to bo in a position to provide against their eventual   illicit employment,

The Report cf Captain Seagrave as to the Naval armaments ofthe states;     3. The ecport of the Air Sub-Commission concerning those states the Commission considers that it -must first of all state clearly that the armaments proposed should onlybe ragarded as provisional.     The unsettled condition of certain, countries and of their neighbours both from the point of view of their domestic organ!-sation and even of their frontiers, makes it impossible for theCommission to express a definite opinion as to the exact size ofthe armaments which they should be&apos;permitted to retain.     The States regarding which the following opinion is givenshould therefore ap:.reo co a possible subsequent revision on theunderstanding that&quot;they can themselves request such a revision by bringing forward the new conditions on which the request shouldbe based,     The Commission ha3 received from the Governments of thedifferent countries mentioned below the following summarisedinformation; -                             ARMENIA 6ARMY.

In his opinion,on account of the present uncertainconditions,the possession of submarines tends to  facilitateacts of hostility which It is the duty of the Lergue of nations to prevent,     &quot;Ho considers that the case woyld be  different, if,either by the limitation of tonnage,or by some other means,guarantees couldbe obtained that submarines would be exclusively employed for thepurpose of defence,which seems impossible in view of the close proximity of the ports of the various countries Interested,                                   --Of

The military forces of this country consist to-day of 55,000men and of a Nati&apos;.nal Guard of 60,000 Volunteers.     At a later date,and when the independance of the Republicis no longer threatened froa outside,this country hopes  to create a militia based on the example of the Swiss hilitia.

LITHUANIA.      At the tiuo of tho Brussels meeting the  Government of the Lith-uanian Republic has not replied to the questionnaire  addressed to it on the subject of its military,naval  and air  status.                            LUXEMBURG.      The Government of Luxemburg asks permission to establish a  mili- tary force of 2,40^ to 3,000 men,this force being intended solely for the maintenance of order within the country,it  being assumed thai,the request of Luxemburg Is based on  the maintenance  of the system of open neutrality resulting from previous Conventions.      Under theso circumstancea,the Commission,not considering itselfqualified to deal with the question of the  open  neutrality of luxembourg -burg is of tho opinion that the  roquest for military  forces made bythe Government of Luxemburg may be accepted.      The Government cf Luxemburg has  no naval  or air  forces,                            MONACO-SAN MARINO.      As these  States  have  no military,naval or air  forces,the  questionof  their military,naval or air status  has not been  considered,    Note.- Generally speaking the  Commission permitted  the  Powersmentioned above tc  possess motor boats armed with machine  guns only,and not to exceed 20  in number.

It  does not consider that  at the  present moment the  establishment  cf -a  central  international office would bo  of any value,until  the  Convention of  Saint Germain is-in force,                        rV,  CONSTITUTION AND COL-POSITION,.f  the  organisation to be  placed at the  disposal  of the  Council ofthe  League  of  Nations for  exercising the right of investigation author-ised by Article  213 of  the  Treaty  of  Peace of Versailles,Article  159of  the  Treaty  of  Peace  of  Saint Germain,Article 104 of  the Treaty ofPeace of Neuilly,Article 143 of the Treaty of Peace of Trianon^                           Opinion of the Commission.

Further,as regards all enquiries on the subject  of Air Forces.       In view of the fact that the states members of the League of  Nations will have no air attacks of a military nature in cx-oneiay  countries, owing to the ciuppression by the Treaties of  Peace of all  military or naval aviation in these countries       In view of the fact that on the other hand  it will be  necessary  to keep a very special watch o^rer any possible transformation of  commercial aircraft Into war aircraft;       It is necessary, in every case where the right of  investigation  is exercised, and whatever be the method selected, to entrust such  enquiries to technical air experts and in no case to  persons lacking  special qualifications.                         V. PRELIMINARY ENQUIRIES.     To servo as a basis for proposals for the carrying out ofArticle VIII of the Covenant.                             Opinion of the Commission.     The Commission decides to consider the practical methods Yihichmay be employed for rapidly obtaining, when the Council shall sodecide, all 5.nfsrmation with regard to armaments, and also theprinciples on which future plans  for the reduction of armamentsmay be based.2,Fhitehall Gardena,S.rr,       1st December,1920,
