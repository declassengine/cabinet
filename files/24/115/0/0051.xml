The LithuanianGovernment would be greatly obliged by the League givingdetails concerning the areas and modus operandi of the suggested plebiscite.  It considers it most important that this question should be decided.  The Lithuaniangovernment considers that the plebiscite should be heldin Seiny and Punsk as well as eastwards of the curzon line, but the Lithuanian government is also of opinionthat r^ plebiscite is required outside of the demarcationline, the agreement to which was signed by Poland onOctober 7th in Suvalki, the Poles having thereby agreedthat the territories North of that line were Lithuanianand having emphasised.&apos;cally denounced the unauthorised andillegal action o  General Zeligowski in crossing this line.  The Lithuanian Government also draws the attentionof the League to the fact that the Lithuanian positionin the proposed plebiscite Is prejudiced by the non-recognition de jure of Lithuanian independence which mayput Lithuania in an unfavourable position In comparisonwith that of Polando                           (Signed)  Tyszkiewicz*w
         (b)    The following letter dated October 29th was               received from the Polish Minister at Brussels               to I-hHymans,  Acting President of the Council:-       &quot;I hasten to inform you Excellency, unofficially,  that     I have received a telegram from Prince Sajf^ioha announce     ing that tho Polish Government accepts the popular     consultation under the control of the League of Nations     which is proposed by the Council and asks to express     Poland&apos;s deep gratitude for the Council&apos;s most impartial     decision;.       &quot;This  decision, which my Government has taken, as  well     as the request for certain information with regard to    .the method of procedure, will be officially brought  to     the knowledge of H.Leon Bourgeois by our Delegateso                               (Signed)  H7HANS.      On November 5th M,Leon Bourgeois In agreement withMuQuinones de Leon and Viscount Ishii, wrote to MMcVoldemanand Askenazy, reminding them that the Council of the Leagueof Nations could only accept, as official, replies addressedto it on behalf of the Lithuanian and Polish Governments  bytheir regular representatives before the council a      On November 7th McLeon Bourgeois received, withinthe time specified, the answers of the Lithuanian and PolishGovernments:-     (a)   Lithuanian reply,   &quot;I have the honour to notify you           that my&quot;Government informs me by telegram that           it accepts the resolutions adopted &quot;by the Council           of the League of Nations on October 28th. I will           communicate to Your Excellency at a later date the           considerations which my Government thinks it           advisable to present together with the ratifications&quot;     (b)   &quot;The undersigned delegates hasten to inform the           League of Nations that the Polish Government is           happy to accept the recommendations made by the           Council of the League in 3the meeting held at           Brussels on the 28th October, to the effect that a           popular expression of opinion under the auspices           and control of the League should be held on the           territories in dispute between Poland and the           Lithuanian State of KovnGo  They have the honour to           submit at the same time certain proposals andl           suggestions which, in the opinion of the Polish           Government; would alone be calculated to  assure  the           proper  carrying out of the proposed plebiscite,-,
 It-WviUld noom that tho  popular expression of opinion in  tho rontcrn Area in  to be also applied to certain partn of tho  district  of Kovno which has in places a mixed population, predominatingly Polish.   If this is the case,  and  on the principle of reciprocity, it  would bo possible to extend tho popular expression of  opinion to the  territories occupied at present by the regular Polish troops;   evidently, however,  the territory in  the East  recently allotted to Poland by tho Treaty of Riga, could in no case be submitted to  a popular  expression of opinion beyond tho line of  demarcation which served as a basis for the claims of tho &quot;Lithuanian Government at Kovno by  virtue of  tho treaty concluded on the 12th of July,  1920.&apos;It  is desirable that tho procedure to bo applied should bo  as simple  and as rapid as possible,  the most effective method of obtaining this would bo/for a considerable number of&apos; /*jumiXDt3xonyx&apos;ti,  asbis uju 1&apos;ubjjuuuj.vOly oy a mo-L^xi tuuu. y. Lithuanian Delegate, to visit the disputed territories.* These Commissioners could summon popular meetings in . the  large and small towns  and in the villages, which could then, spontaneously  and immediately,  give  their rotes in favour of Poland  or of tho Lithuanian State cf  Kovno;  . in.this way  one  could avoid fvo difficul- ties,  abuses,  and&apos;displays  of race antagonism, which unfortunately occur toe often in such circumstances. The  question  of tho evacuation of territories whore popular expression of opinion is  being taken could bo solved in a satisfactory manner by arranging that the troops occupying a district should evacuate it as the popular expression of opinion is  taken:   a3 soon as the  expression  of  opinion has boon given,  the district should be occupied, by the  forces  of one- or- other party, In  conformity with the  decision which shall be taken by the Commission of the  League of Nations.    Tho most  difficult uuostion concerns  the demobilisation of the troops of General Zcligowskl.   Tho Polish Government cannot take upon itself the responsibility of carrying  out this task by  force.   -  It would so em,  however&apos;, that the  best solution  of this  problem would bo.the transformation  of  these troops into local militias.      In tho hope that the League&apos; will bo, able in this way  tc take the most effective neasurec and those best adapted  to the circumstances,  the Polish Government feels it both a  duty and an honour to offer its full  moral support.

M.Leon Bourgeoiswas informed by the French Pr.ime Minister that his Government wouldbe able to furnish 200 or 300 men for this purpose.  This informa-tion was communicated by him to M,Hymans.   M.Hymans replied inthe name of the Belgian Government that Belgium would be disposed to help in the formation of a body of troops,to assist in  the taking.of the popular expression of opinion, provided that this force was genuinely international in character, and that the expenseswere charged either to the States affected, or to the Leagues        In agreement wit) MiLeon Bourgeois and M,Hymons,the Secretary General^ on November 5th, addressed a note toall the Members of  the Council, with the exception of Brazil .and Japan, asking their co-operation in tho  formation of  aninternational force to ensure the  taking of the popularexpression of opinion.  For this  curpose it would be sufficientIf each State Member of the Council  supplied two companies of infantry, and a machine gun section, together with a few officerschosen for their knowledge of  the Russian or  the Polish  language,or for their administrative experience.                                 -5-
        There seems no doubt that the expenses  should becharged In the final event to the country or countriesbenefiting by the expression of opinion.   It will be  for  theCouncil to decide on the provisional administration of  the funds required for tho occupation.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.T/.1.      November 25th, 1920.
