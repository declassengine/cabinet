Although there has been some improvement in the supplyof bacon from places other than North America, it is now obviousthat the alternative source of supply will not be available at as early a date as was expected, the date now given is October,1921.          By carefully regulating the price paid to the Danishproducers in order to encourage them to make the maximum possible output of bacon, the supply from that source has beenbrought up from nil this time last year to nearly 50$ of thenormal.  On the other hand the decontrol of home-produced baconhas not resulted in any increased supplies, and the Irishdemand for their own product has, if anything decreased the exportable surplus available from that oountry.  Moreover, thehigh price of corn in Canada and the keen competition for the limited supplies of hogs amongst the very large number of canadian paoklng houses has resulted in a deorease of Canadiansupplies, and makes the future outlook for bacon from thatcountry very serious.  Supplies from Sweden, Holland and SouthAfrica are at present quite negligible.          The attached chart may be of interest as indicating the course of bacon prices since re-control in August 1919,  Itwill be seen that the shortage of &quot;best&quot; bacon has resulted in very high prices for such bacon of this quality as is decontrolled,Irish bacon which in April, 1920, was 198s. per cwt, rose ondecontrol to 280s. per cwt,, and although the seasonal flush hasnow reduced the price to 250s, per cwt., it is extremely unlikelythat it will go any lower, andkn all probability it will risesteadily again throughout the spring and summer of next year.If bacon were decontrolled on January 1st, 1921, the officials ofthe Ministry and all traders of experience agree that the priceof Danish and Canadian bacon would at once approximate to theIrish price,  The consumer would therefore have to pay consider-ably more for this baaon and would get no corresponding advantage in the form of inoreased production, since It is agreed that thepurchase price which the Ministry of Pood is paying to the Danishproducers is sufficiently liberal to ensure as rapid an increasein supplies as is physically possible.
          The position in America is that the hog population is from I2\i to 15$ below that of last year.  The record corncrop in America will result in farmers holding back theirhogs so that the run which is usually available at this timeof&quot;the year will not really be in full swing until January orFebruary, 1921,  Eogs will be fatter in consequence and there-fore less suitable for the English markete  On the other hand the fall In hog prices which will take place during the runwill result in lower prices for American bacon during the first three months of next year whether or not Government purchasingis continued.  During the summer of next year higher prices are inevitable and this applies specially to hams which willbe the only really lean meat available from the excessivelyfat hogs.          In these circumstances the decision is a matter ofsome difficulty.  If it were practicable the wise policy wouldbe to buy a good stock of American hams for forward deliveryand to continue purchases of Danish and. Canadian bacon until theautumn in order to avoid the considerable rise in price whichwill obtain directly private importation starts.  The trouble is that the Canadians have always resented the freeing of Irishbacon while their own remained controlled,  and that the Danes,in making any contract, insist on a cancellation clause in casegeneral control is removed.  While I am anxious to discontinuepurchases of American bacon largely unsuitable for consumption in this country, at the earliest possible  moment, I object tothe British consumer having to pay the Danes and Canadians30/- to 40/- a cwtc more for bacon without any correspondingbenefit.  In suggesting a policy I am finally influenced by theIndex number, and I think it would be wise to defer the risein price which de-control of bacon will involve until it can be compensated for by the seasonal fall in the price of otherfoodstuffs.          I ask, therefore, that I may be at liberty to contract with the Danes for thoir exportable surplus of bacon for thefirst three months of 1921 and to continue purchases from north american, Canada and other sources down to 31st.
