It was estimated that the deficit for a full year at rates of expenditure current in July would amount to  54,500,000 for the United Kingdom and it was subsequently calculated that to recoup the deficiency from the date when any Increaoos could become operative by the 51st July, 1921, would involve a total increase in revenue at the annual rate of  73,500,000.   The Rates advisory Committee framed their recommendations on this basis and made proposals estimated to yield the whole sum required.            Gioy assumod that the increase in all passenger fares would take effect as from the 1st August, but it was decided to defer the increase on Ordinary fares and on Season tickets until the 6th August.    The result was a substantial loss of receipts in the early days of August, and a very large number of people proceeding on their holidays were able to take return tickets at the old rates.   The operation of the new worteme^s fares was deferred, owing to practical difficulties, until the 1st September, and the Cabinet approved a limitation under which the maximum increase was restricted to 2/- a week.           Since the estimate of expenditure was framed, there has been a further serious rise in the Index Number of retail prices upon which the Sliding Scale for Railwaymenfs wages ia based.           From the 1st October additional allowances of 2/. a week to the Conciliation Grades, and a proportionate bonus to other Railway Grades have involved payments in Great Britain alone at the                                                               rate/
rate of  3,800,000 a year, and in view  of  the  rise  in rents  and1the&apos;reduction in the Bread Subsidy a further increase  as  from thi1st January next, is probable.  The index number was  164 on 1stOctober as against 161 on the 1st September on which the  last adment: of Railway wa&amp;es was made.  The downward  trend  in the prioeiof materials is not yet reflected in Railway Expenditure.

           The  cumulative  effect o; all  these  factors would,  I think,  have  been that while  we  mi $it have  secured  equilibrium  on current operation in Great Britain&apos; over the period 1st August, 1920 to  31st July,  1921, with  a loss of  3,000,000 in Ireland, we should probably not have succeeded  in  making good the aoprued loss (some  13,500,000  in all) for the  four months April to July 1920, end-&quot; any serious  trade depression would have made  even  current equilibrium doubtful.          The  Coal Strike has upset all previous estimates and made a loss  on railway working over  the remaining  period of control in- ovitable, unless  there is a  substantial fall  in prices or a substantial  increase in traffio;   neither  of which can be reasonably anticipated.   The  actual loss of revenue due  to the Strike cannot be accurately  measured or even  closely  estimated at this date;   but a -provisional  figure to cover the  whole -period of  the strike and its consequential  effects  in general  dislocation of trade is  0,000,000.          If it were held that  no  loss  in Railway Working must fall upon the taxpayer  after 31st March, 1920, it would be necessary to raise,  before  the  15th August next  a sum of at least  24,000,000, of which there is  attributable          To the Coal Strike    ... &apos; ...    8,000,000          To Ireland   ...    ...    ...    3,000,000          and  to  other factors,  say, ...   13.,000,000          Even if  increases  could  be made operative from the 1st January next,  this would be  an  addition to Rates and Pares at therate of  38,000,000 per annum or a  further increase of approximately25$ over 1913  rates and fares.         pit will  be borne in mind  that in the recent revisionit was necessary to consider very  carefully the extent to whichtraffio would  bear further charges  and  on this point both, theRailway &quot;witnesses  and the Committee itself laid stress.
                         ** 4r **Suoh indications as are presentod by the August and Septemberfigures and the general state of trade at the moment, seem tome to point to the inadviaability of any increase in railway raand charges.  It is doubtful whether additional revenue oouldin fact be secured and it is certain that if the oharges were imposed thero would be general irritation and groat opposition from Radars who arc already feeling the decline in Trade.         Moreover, it would, I submit, be difficult to justifyimposing upon the users of railways a loss due to a temporarydisturbanoo suoh as the Coal Strike, whioh would normally beborne by the Shareholders and is only a liability of theGovernment through the aooident of control as it has beeninterpreted by the Agreements made with the railways.         As regards Ireland, it would bo impossible to raisethe deficit by increasing charges on the Irish railways andit would be equally impossible to justify imposing it upon theusers of the Railways in Great Britain.         The monoy already provided by Parliament in theBailway Agreements Vote, together with certain sums whioh i hope to recover from the Railway Companies in the adjustmontof past accounts, should suffice to meet the liabilities tothe Companies apart from the loss on tho Coal Strike and thatincurred in Ireland.  To meet tho latter it will be necessary if my recommendation is approved, to take a supplementary estimate and I submit that I may be authorised to prepare suchan estimate for  10,000,000 - the figure to be subject :to revisif any data onabling a more accurate estimate to be made oomesto hand in the meantime., ,         23ia  10,000,000 allows for the whole of the loss on thCoal Strike  ( 8,000,000) and  2,000,000 representing the estimaIrish deficit for the seven months  ending 28th February. 1921.whioh will roquire to bo made good  in  ch3 current  finanoial yo&amp;j                                    BRIO  GSDSSS.Ministry of  Transport.-  19th November,  1920.
