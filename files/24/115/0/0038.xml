                                            4&quot;i65IS DOCUMENT IS THE PBOPEKTC 0? HIS BRITANBIG MAJESTY&apos;S (JOYMfflT),;JU^----------------------------------------------------.....                             0 A B n u,                     ).P.-2138.                                                     5          Beport of tho Cabinet Committee,  consisting of the          Secretaries of State for Foreign  Affairb,  V7ar, and India, &apos;                  (Hefere noo Cabinet 68 (20),  Conclusion  4 (4)*         It was decided at the meeting of the  Cabinet whioh approved    in principle of the Russian Trodo Agreement s-    (l)  that tho actual terms of the Agreement of  June 30 (accepted    by the Soviet)  should a3 far as-possible ba reproduced in    Paragraph 8 of the Draft Traie Agreement,  where  they are at present    somewhat unduly condensed^    (2)   that a specific referenoe should  bo  inserted to  Soviet    activities in Asia Minor,  Persia, Afghanistan,  and India;  or    (3)   alternatively that a covering letter should be sent  with    the Agreement to the Soviet Representatives elaborating the above    points;  and we  were appointed a Committee  to  prepare tho requisite    drafts.    We came to the conclusion that it would be decirable    as  far as possible, to combine the advantages of (2) and (3);  i.o*    to  insert in the Agreement itself, where they would have a more    binding  value,  the references desired;  but to amplify  them in  a    letter indicating with greater precision the  manner in which we shall    expect the Russian assurances to be fulfilled.         Wo  append  accordingly    (A)   Our proposed amendment of Paragraph  2 of  the  Draft Agreement,    from the  words  &quot;with regard to&apos;7 In the  last line but two (tho    words that we substitute being the exact words used in the    Agreement of June 30).       &quot;with  regard to the mutual cessation of hostile  action  or    undertakings and of official propaganda, direct  or  indirect, against    the other party; and more  particularly  to  Ae3istenoe by the So\let    Government f/om any attempt by military action  or propaganda to \    encourage any of tho peoples of Asia in any form of hostile action
 against  British interests  or  the  British Empiro. Tho most conapiou- ous  forms  of  this  activity from which  tho Soviet Government now undertake  to  desist  are  tho following  - (1) assistance given by- Soviet agents,  forces, arms,  and money to tho Turkish Nationalist movement in the  Caucasus and  Asia Minor; (Z) hostilities in and against Persia;  (3)  negotiations and agreements with tho Afghan Government directed  against tho British Empire and interests in India; (4) revolutionary propaganda in India itself,  Further information as  to  the manner  in which tho British Government will expect these  assurances to be fulfilled is contained in an accompanying  letter&quot;, (B-).  In this letter, which will be addressed to the Soviet G-government, we propose tie following more detailed reference to the four points above referred to.        I,  Turkish  Nationalist Movement,     With regard to  the sIlianoe between Bolshevik and Turkish forces in Asia Minor His Majesty1s Government have avidenco of the following activities on the part of the Soviet Government or its agents, from which they now call upon the latter to desist.     They a re aware  :   (1);   That a Bolshevik-Islamic  Treaty was concluded at moscow in May 1920, between Messrs Lenin,  Chicherin andother Russian Commissars, on tho one hand,  and representatives of Mustapha Vernal and other Revolutionary bodies in the Easton the other,   In this Agreement,  which was published in the&quot;Pravda&quot;  of June 29th, the  Russians promised to provideofficers,  troops, arms 3nd  money to the Turkish nationalist forces,  who undertook &quot;inter alia&quot; to drive the British outof Persia,  to put no hindrance in  tho way of Bolshevik &apos;propaganda, and to encourage and assist the national Movementin India  In every way.                               -* Jj t*
(2). That conferences have been held in the course of 1920 at Mentroux, St. Moritz, Moscow, Berlin and Munich with the same object.

(3). That money, military supplies, and troops have been sent by the Soviet Government to Mustapha Kemal at Angora, and that a Soviet Delegation headed by Eliava has only recently been negotiating with him there.

(4). That letters, which have been published in the Turkish press, have passed between Mustapha Kemal and the Russian Commissary for Foreign Affairs (M. Chicherin), regarding the conditions of the Turco-Bolshevik Alliance.

(5). That a Nationalist Assembly was held at Angora in July 1920, attended by Soviet delegates, at which the President, Mustapha Kemal Pasha, made a speech in the course of which he said:

"We have sought out the Bolsheviks; we have exchanged official correspondence with the Soviet Government, the tenour of which you know, and the Soviet Government has promised us all manner of material help, arms, guns and money. Of late, the conflicts which arose in the Caucasus prevented the arrival of this help. We are on the point of eliminating such obstacles"; and that on August 5th he issued a Proclamation announcing the alliance and assistance of the Bolsheviks.

(6). Much further evidence, including the proceedings and resolutions of the Baku Congress held in September last, could be adduced as to the close co-operation of the Bolshevik and Turkish forces, culminating in the recent attack upon the Armenian Republic.
                  II.   PERSIA,       It was in May last that tho Bolshevik fleetbombarded Enzeli, and landed a force there whence theymarched inland and occupied Reshto   Other landings fromBolshevik gunboats were made at Lenkoran, Astara, Keshed- i-Sar and Bcnd&amp;tf-i-G-az.   The prisoners  taken in theseengagements, including  a Staff Officer, were Russians andbelonged to the 11th Bolshevik Amy,       These proceedings were preceded and accompanied byan intense Bolshevik propaganda,  designed to set up a bolshevik  -Republic in Persia.       The Soviet Government has  more than once declaredthat it had no hostile intention  against Persia and thatits forces would be immediately withdrawn-,   Neverthelessthey remain and the Persian coast of the Caspian is stillin their armed occupationo   Too  efforts made by successivePersian delegates to procure their withdrawal by negotiation with the Soviet Government of Azerbaijan, by whom they hadbeen ostensibly despatched, have  uniformly failed, becausethe Azerbaijan Government has invariably represented thatthe Russian Soviet Government would not consent toevacuation, and that the matter must he settled at Moscow,       It is clear that in the last resort the responsibilities ^ity for these attacks upon Persia rests with the SovietGovernment *       H,   Government, who have  special relations with Persia and the Persian Government, desire to point out thatthese actions are wholly inconsistent with the assurancesnow given by the Soviet Government in concluding the Trade                                                    Agreement

The attention or H,M.

(6)   Despatch of revolutionary  agents  to  the above-namedcountries and  conduct of revolutionary propaganda there.
                            6   ^  &apos;                   IV, INDIA      Tho evidence already given under the heading Afghanistanshows conclusively that the Soviet  authorities  are using  thatcountry as a platform from which to launch an intensive Bolshevik propaganda in India, and that  this  policy is  directed not byirresponsible local Soviets, but by the Central Government in moscow.      The Instructions given by the Soviet Government to  Suriitz,tho principal Soviet emissary  in Afghanistan,, with regard to Indianpropaganda, are known to His Majesty &apos;a Government *   It has  never been concealed either by Suritz or  by his masters  that  India is thereal object of the Afghan mission,  and a well-known  Indian Communisthas been selected as the head  of the Indian base and instructionalcentre at TashkencU   It has been in contemplation to move thisbase to Kabul as soon as this  can be arranged,  in  order to establishcloser connection with India,  and to foment unrest among  the tribes-.It has also been in contemplation to establish another agency  onthe Pamir-Chitral frontier of  India.      All these activities as  well  as the employment of  Indianrevolutionaries and the export, of anti-British literature fromRussia to India, are clearly precluded by the assurances  given by theSoviet Government, and His Majestyfs Government must insist as aconcomitant of the Trade Agreement  that they  be henceforwardobserved.
