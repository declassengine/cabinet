(THIS DOC0H2HT IS TIP:, PROPERTY OF HIS ^RITAIIPIC IIAJT^TY^ GOVIIRNISIIT)^S E 0 R E T.C.P.2109.                   0 A 15 I H E T.                    Proposal to supersede the Supremo                    Council by the Council of the League                    of Wations,                     (lienoranduiii by the Foreign Office.)           There is reason to supposo that during the forthcoming      meeting of the Assembly of the League of Hations at Geneva,      Lord Kobert Cecil, the second representative of the Union of      South Africa, intends to propose the abolition of the Supreme      Council and its supersession by the League,      2,   Lord Robert has already advocated this course in the House      of Commons, whore, on April 29th, he expressed the opinion      that tho Council of the league must be made the so/O organ of      international action, and that the whole existing International      apparatus including the Supreme Council should be&apos;definitely     -dispensed with at the earliest possible date.   His attitude      may bo summed up by two quonaUonsfrom his speech:-           &quot;The Supreme Council was brought into existence for the      purpose of war, and for the purpose of conducting the Peace      negotiations,  and so long as it is there we have not definitely      passed out of  the condition of war&quot;.      And again:-           &quot;Unless the Supreme Counoil  die, the League  of Hations      cannot be born; the power of the  former annihilates the authority      of the latter&quot;.      3,   That the  League of $relations will eventually  discharge  some      of the functions which are  at present wielded by the Supreme      Council is not questioned,  but neither can  the League take over&apos;      all  the functions of the Supreme  Council, nor has the time come      for  transferring  some  of those which will undoubtedly be trans-      ferrod ultimately,   Not all  the  peace treaties  have as  yet                                                               been/
beyond/ b.en  ratified,  and  the provisions of others are still awaiting execution..   It is  accordingly impossible -to say with justice that  the  conditions  of war have entirely passed,   moreover, the abstention  of the United States from the League, the present eclipse of Russia,  the unavoidable delay in the admission of Germany and  other ex-enemy States create a situation quite different from  that  contemplated as normanl, and the outstand- ing fact, as  pointed out by the Prime Minister in tho debate last  April, is  that  &quot;the whole fabric of Europe&quot; depends to-day upon the  oEe body which at present has the &quot;strength, force, organisation and will to direct the affairs of Europe&quot; - namely, the Supreme Council.,   It is earnestly hoped that the entry of  some of tho ex-enemy Powers into the League will not be indefinitely delayed; but their entry would only aecen- tuate the difficulty   of entrusting to.the League the enormous task  of seeing  to the execution of the treaties of peace. 4,-    Apart fro;/  this, there are still a number of questions which call, and will continue for some time to call, for co-operation between the allied Governments of Great Britain, Prance, Italy and. Japan, and so long as this is the case, there could- be no sense in wishing to prevent the Heads of those Governments from.meeting together, as and when required, to discuss matters  of common interest and to take decisions with a view to concerted actiona 5.   There is no substance in the allegation that the Supreme Council is stifling the League; on the contrary, it pa^es the way for its entry into full activity.   The Supreme Council at present embodies the spirit of co-operation between themembers in the interest of general peace, and this is also the essence of the League of Lationsd   The Supreme Council is carrying on the work for which it was created.    It is to-dayassuming the burden of many tasks which are as  yet obviously
beyond the strength of the Infant League, and it is shieldingthe League fro:.1, the odium involved in a possible non-success     unor in/popular decisions,6.,   That tho co-existence of tho Supreme Council and theLeague Is not an impracticable arrangement, is evidenced bythe beneficiont work already accomplished by the Lea^e in such questions as those of the Aaland Islands  the dispute between poland and Lithuania:; the repatriation of war prisoners, andthe campaign against starvation and typhus in Central Europe.As the strength of the League grows, it will gradually attainits true position as the recognised supreme organ for inter-national action^   There is no ground for any apprehension .that in the path of ouch development the Supreme Council willeither create, or itself constitute, an obstacle or a barrier.Foreign Office, S.V;.l.      November 17th, 1920*
