[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government^]   435Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1920.   ,000! .U I IMANDATES A.       &apos; MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    A FINAL decision about Mandates A is  required.  The Assembly  of the Leagueof Nations is concerned about their submission to the Council, and will probably not allow  the gathering at Geneva to come to an end without a decision being taken on thepoint.    It is understood that the Council  of the League is likely to hold a  meeting while at Geneva to consider  the.se  Mandates, and  it has beun informed that they will besubmitted without  further delay.  The  Mandates concerned are those   for  Syria,Mesopotamia and Palestine.    The French Mandate for Syria is drawn on the same lines as ours for Mesopotamia,though not actually identical  with it.  There is nothing in  it to which we desire to object.    The Mandate for Mesopotamia has passed through several, stages, tending in eachcase to further simplification.  It has  been shown to, and approved by, the French andItalian Governments, to whom we were under a pledge at San  Remo to submit it   Inits last printed form this Mandate was approved by the Cabinet a few weeks ago.  Itwas then, however, decided to  introduce into it  two  fresh  clauses.   The first ofthese  was to admit of the employment of local forces outside the Mandated territorywith the consent of the Mesopotamian Government.  The War  Office entertained  some doubts as to the wisdom of such a clause, since the French would be much more likelyto take advantage of it with native forces raised in Syria than we  should be with nativeforces raised in Mesopotamia.  It has, however, been inserted, in a form approved bySir Percy Cox, and runs as follows (vide article 2, italicised in the draft):     The  said local forces  shall thereafter  be responsible to the local authorities,subject always to the control to be  exercised  over  these forces  by the MandatoryPower, who shall not employ them  for other than  the  above-mentioned purposes,except with the consent of  the Mesopotamian Government,    The  second  addition was  a  clause providing  for reimbursement of expenses incurred   by the  Mandatory  in  organising  the administration  and developing theresources of the country.  The form in which it has been approved by Sir Percy Coxis the following (vide article 15, italicised in the draft):     Upon the coming into  force of the  Organic Law an arrangement shall be made between  the Mandatory and the Mesopotamian Government for settling the terms onwhich the latter will take over Public  Works  find pther services of a permanentcharacter, the benefit of which will  pass to the Mesopotamian Government.   Suckarrangement shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations.    As regards the Palestine Mandate, this Mandate  also has  passed through severalrevises.  When it was first shown  to  the  French Government it at once excited theirvehement criticisms on the ground of  its almost exclusively Zionist  complexion and ofthe manner in. which  the  interests and  rights of the Arab  majority (amounting toabout nine-tenths of the population) were ignored.  The Italian Government expressedsimilar apprehensions.   It  was felt  that this  would constitute a very serious, andpossibly a fatal, objection when the  Maudate came  ultimately before the  Council ofthe League.  The Mandate, therefore, was largely rewritten, and finally received theirassent.  It was also considered by an Inter-Departmental Conference here, in whichthe Foreign  Office, Board of Trade, War Office and India Office were represented, andwhich passed the final draft.    In the  course of  these discussions  strong objection  was  taken  to a statement which had been inserted in the Preamble of the first draft to the  following effect:          &quot; Recognising the historical connection of the Jewish  people with Palestine    and  the claim which this gives  them to reconstitute Palestine as their  National    Home.&quot;       367  [4996]
      It was pointed out (1) that, while  the Powers had unquestionably recognised the historical connection  of  the Jews  with Palestine by  their formal acceptance of  the Balfour Declaration and their  textual incorporation of it in the Turkish Peace Treaty drafted at San Remo,  this was far from  constituting  anything in the nature of a legal claim, and that the use of such words might be, and  was, indeed, certain to be, used as the basis of  all sorts of  political claims by the Zionists for the control of Palestinian administration in the future, and \ 2) that, while Mr. .Balfour&apos;s Declaration had provided for the  establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine, this was not the same thing as the  reconstitution of Palestine as a Jewish National Home--an  extension of the phrase for which there  was  no justification, and which was certain  to be employed in the future  as the basis for claims of the character to  which I have referred.     On the other hand, the Zionists pleaded for  the insertion of some such phrase in the preamble, on the ground that it would  make  all the difference to  the money that they aspired to raise in foreign countries for the development of Palestine.     Mr. Balfour, who  interested himself keenly in  their case,  admitted, however, the force of the  above contentions, and, on  the eve of  leaving  for  Geneva, suggested an alternative form of words which I am prepared to  recommend.     Paragraph  3 of the Preamble  would  then conclude as follows  (vide  the words italicised in the Draft):      &quot; and whereas recognition has thereby (i.e., by the  Treaty of Sevres) been given to     the  historical connection of the Jewish  people with Palestine, and to  the grounds     for reconstituting  their National Home in that country.&quot;     Simultaneously the Zionists pressed for  the concession of preferential rights  for themselves in respect of public works,  &amp;c, in Article  11.     It was felt unanimously, and was agreed by Mr.  Balfour, that there was no ground for making this concession,  which ought to be refused.     There remain the two additions  made to the Mesopotamian Mandate in respect of (a) employment of local forces outside Palestine, (b) repayment of expenses.     As regards  the former, the French raised no objection, and the  requisite words have been inserted in Article 17 (they are given in italics in the Draft)     As regards repayment,  it was felt  very undesirable to emphasise this demand in the case  of Palestine, because the Administration, from  which they will be recovered, will not he a Native Administration as  in Mesopotamia, set up under an Organic Law,but  will really be the administration of the Mandatory Power,  i.e.,  ourselves, and-very invidious comment  might be excited in the  League  of  Nations  if we provided expressly in the Covenant for asking our own consent to recoup ourselves.     As a matter  of fact these  reimbursements will be made automatically, as the opportunity occurs, and we are already arranging  for the  cost of the   railways which the Civil Administration has taken over from the Army.     During the last few hours a telegram has been received from Sir H. Samuel, urging that, in order to facilitate the raising of  loans by the Palestine Administration, whichwill otherwise be impossible, words should be added  to Article 27, providing that  onthe termination of the  Mandate,  the future Government  of Palestine shall fully honourthe financial obligations incurred by  the  Palestinian Administration during the periodof the Mandate.  This appears to be a quite reasonable demand, and I have accordinglyadded words (italicised at the end of Article 27) in order to meet it.     With  this explanation, therefore, I hope  that  the  Mandates in  the  form now submitted may be formally passed and  forwarded to the  Council of the League.
