      This Bill consolidates the law relating to Police Pensions in England andWales and in Scotland and amends that law so as to give effect, in allessentials, to the recommendations of the Committee on the Police Servicepresided over by. Lord Desborough.      The main recommendation of the Desborough Committee was that standardpension scales should be fixed for all forces in Great Britain in lieu of thevariety of scales adopted by Police Authorities in England and Wales under theexisting law and the different and less favourable scale prescribed by statute for the Scottish Police.      Under the scale recommended by the Committee for ordinary pensions, theperiod of service to qualify for retirement without medical certificate is fixed at 30 years as against 26 years, the period which now applies in mostforces in England and Wales and as against 3fj/ years in the Scottish forces.The Committee also recommended a new scale of pensions for men injured on duty and a slight increase of widows&apos; pensions.      As regards the financial effect  of the bill there will be some increasein cost in respect of the new scheme of disablement pensions and widowspensions, but in the long run, when the new scale of ordinary pensions takeseffect, there will be a considerable saving because the adoption of 30 years inEngland as the&apos; period to qualify for a full pension will more than counterbalancethe increased cost of the disablement and widows pensions and of the ordinarypenaions in Scotland^      The Bill is regarded as a matter of urgency because of the agitation inthe Scottish Police who are pressing for the immediate adoption of the pensionscales recommended by the Deaborough Committee.   There is every sign that ifthe Bill cannot be passed this year feeling among the Scotch Police willbecome aoute.   At the same time any delay postpones the saving on the costof ordinary pensions in England and Wales.                                        E .S.23rd November, 1920.7Q24,
