The following Kotos have been prepared in the Ministry        of Labour in view of a oonolusion recorded at the Cabinet        Meeting of Uth November, 1920, /(&quot;Cabinet 60)(20jf.  The terms of        the oonolusion require that the Ministry of Labour and the        Ministry of Transport should obtain information &quot;in relation to        sohemee whioh were being&apos;put forward in franco and Italy for        giving worlanen a share in the management of Industry&quot;, x               In view of seme noteworthy developments in the application        of this principle in Germany, Norway and the United States in the        course of the present year, it has been thought well to add a few        remarks concerning those three countries.                               I.   JBANCB.        (a) Industries in General.               In general industry the Works Counoil system has made        little headway in France.   The employers, however, - as shown        by the report of a number of large manufacturers to the national        Association for Labour Legislation - are prepared to establish        voluntary (not statutory) joint councils with the limited powers        indicated below               Consultation as to -                 got to discuss -           Methods of work.                      finance           Encouragement of inventions.

Hygiene and safety.           Execution of collective agreementsi Notes dealing with certain aspects of the same subject are being pre-  pared in the Ministry of Transport, and the Intelligence officers of  the two Departments have been in consultation to avoid overlap and to  ensure so far as practicable, that the two documents shall oanplemaait  each other.
      (b)  Railways.I           Under a decree of the Ministry of Public Works, dated     15th October, 1919 x, there were established for  Tench railways  *          (a) A provisional Committee of Management; and          (b) a provisional Teohnioal Committee for Material                and Traffio.            Bach Committee consisted of 13 members; on each the     workers had 3 representatives and the six great railway systems     one each.   On the Management Committet three members were  to     represent commerce, industry and agriculture - say,  consumers.     On the Materials Committee, three were to represent  manufacturers     of rolling stock, etc.-say, producers.  jHChe former com-     mittee stands for the Kail ways as &quot;produoers&quot;; the latter,  for     the Railways as &quot;consumers^ *   Ehe president of the Management     Committee was to be appointed by the railway managers;  it is     not clear by whom the president of the Materials committee  was     to be appointed.            The question of railway re-organisation has been tinder     consideration since the early spring of this year.   In  the     ocurse  of their campaign for nationalisation, conferences of     railwaymen repeatedly voted against continuing to co-operate on     the Management and Materials Committees unless such  collaboration     involved a real share in management and control.  It was alleged,     too, that oollaboration with concessionary companies conflicted     with the ideal of nationalisation and might delay its attainment.     The extremists precipitated a strike in May in order to speed     up plans for &quot;industrialised nationalisation&quot;.  The strike was     a complete failure and served only to discredit the  more radical  &quot;     section among the railwaymen.   On 7th September the National     federation of Railway Workers voted by 894 votes to  118 for the     immediate resumption of oollaboration with the Government and the     Companies on joint committees.\Thelie main  object of the decree was to secure co-operation between thserent  systems in providing for the needs of the devastated areas.
              The Government Commission on Public Works  and  Com-       munioations has just issued its report on the re-organisation       of the railways.   She Commission had under consideration       three draft Bills, prepared respectively by the Economic Labour       Council (representing trade unionists, 00-operators,  &amp;c), by       the Minister of ^ublio Works (M. Le Iroeauer), and by a private       member of the chamber, M Loucheur, (apparently in the interests       of railway shareholders. &amp;              Under the Economio Labour Council1s Bill,  national       oontrol would be exeroised by a Central Council,  which would       also arrange the demarcation of regional systems.   The term       of appointment would be six years, half of the council being       re-elected every three years.   The counoil would consist  of       48 members  -            16 chosen by the National ^deration of Rail my Workers,             8 to represent technical and 8 to represent mscu&amp;l  workers;            16 representatives of the &quot;consumers&quot; or users of the               railways;            16 representing the nation as a whole - e.g.9 members of               the public  services, persons of technioal ability, etc.       in executive committee of IS members of the Central council       would be appointed, 4 from eaoh group.  . Special directive       bodies would be appointed for development, traffic, and main-       tenanoe.   Wage agreements would bo subject to the approval       of the Central council.              In  each^egion&quot;, there would be three general directors       and  an Advisory Counoil of 24 members -             8 chosen by the railwayme:a*s unions;             8 by  industrial organisations - employers1 associations,                trade unions, and agricultural  societies;             8 by  the Minister of Publio Works,  representing the                publio services.              The  Commission, however, has reported in favour of       Me le Trooauer!s plan, whioh involves the retention of separato-       ly managed systems, administration being co-ordinated by a                                                               Higher x In an administrative council of 30 members,   4 would represent share-holders and  6 the  personnel; the  Government might appoint three assessorswho oould demand the  reconsideration of any proposed measure. The railwaywore to &quot;belong  to the  State&quot;  and to come under a &quot;single command&quot; (theafcainistrative  council), but  dlreotlon  should be entrusted to interestsstimulated to take risks  for the  possibility  of profits.
    Higher Council of Railways, representing in eguil numbers (a)     railway workers and managements, and (b) &quot;the public&quot;.            1x1 J^Sf LT Human it e oritioised the provisions of M.  Le     Troequerfs Bill as regards &quot;control&quot; by the Higher Railway     Council, on the grounds that *          1. The members would all be nominated by the Minister;          8. Its decisions would require the approval of the  Minister,               and their execution would be entrusted to the               Companies; x ,          3. The members would be chosen as fellows:-               The director and two administrative officials of  each             of the six great Companies (16),               Six persons nominated to represent the workers,               Twelve representatives of employers,               Kine public officials.               Three &quot;representantB professionels&quot;,               One member ef the Council of State;     giving at least 30 members out of 49 to the employers.   This     account of the proposed method of distributing veting power is     o on firmed by a summary of the Bill in the journal Of fie iel  of     6th October,            The preamble to the Bill states that  -               &quot;The hour has now ccme to achieve the unity whioh                 is to be desired in the working of the railways,                 to ensure their financial stability, te connect their                 development with the daily life of the people (realis-                 ing the Identity of the interests of the systems  with                 those of the public) and to allow the staff and the                 users of the railways to ee-operate in ensuring the                 proper performance of the services in which they  are                 alike interested&quot;.     (c) Saar Coal Mines.            At the beginning of 1980 a Bill was prepared for the     creation of an offioe to operate the State mines of the Saar     distriot.   The office was to be administered by a Board of 15                                                      Directors, s It was alleged that  the last word would always remain with theonrcanios, although the  authority of the Minister would leave  roomor&quot; favouritism and other faults of state control.
mm-   **Directors, including nine representatives of the MinisterialDepartments ooncerned, and six members appointed by the Minibt-erof Mines, chosen as follows :**   two from ooal consumers.,two from mine owners, and two from french workers in ooalmines.   The office was to enjoy the utmost administrative andfinanoial freedom, in order that production might be increased and satisfactory living conditions ensured for the workers.The power of the Directors was to be limited only with regardto the issue of loans and the division of dividends,                     II.  ITATiY,                  (a) Industries in General.       Unofficial shop stewards and works councils movementsmade some headway in Italy in 1919, as they did in theUnited Kingdom during the war.   As in this country, themovement found support from many local trade union leaders.The Turin &quot;Chamber of Labour&quot; (quasi - Trades Council, butmuch more powerful) sought to direct the rank and file move-ment and played much the same part as the District committees on the Clyde and elsewhere.  But the Italian workers lookedon the whole rather to the Russian Soviets than to any other foreign source of inspiration.       In January a cotton factory at Turin whose owners werenot affiliated to the employers1 association and refused toaccept the recognised district standards, was oocupled bythe workers.   The Government intervened by taking over thefactory - as the British Government commandeered the AllianceAeroplane work during the war.   When the firm agreed to conform with the recognised standards it was allowed to resume control.   The workers had been supported by theirown National federation (textile workers), by the localChamber of Labour and by the National General confederation
Of Labour (compare Trades Union Congress)*    The  action  ofthe Turin Workers was Imitated  in a few isolated oases  andwithout striking effect  in the next few months.    It  formed,however, a precedent for the very general movement in September.       Luring the intervening period there  had been constantdiscussion in advanced Labour and Socialist circles as tothe machinery and methods of &quot;workers1  control&quot;.    Therelations between the new councils, the old trade unions and the Socialist party, were canvassed, just as  they havebeen in Germany.   More  important for present purposes isthe question of the constitution and functions of the WorksCouncils themselves.   In the spring it was proposed  bythe Turin Chamber of Labour that all the workers  shouldelect shops stewards who must be trade  union members, andthat those constituting  the Works Council,  should electfrom their own members an. Executive Committee.   The  mem-bers of the Council would negotiate with the employers on questions arising in the establishment, would secure  the observance of agreements etc., and would study the methodsof production and the technique of the  business.       A scheme on the same lines was approved in principle by the General Confereration of Labour  on 155th May, butaction was postponed till the return of the Italian delega-tion from russia.   It was proposed to include in the council&apos;s, wherever possible, representatives of  teohnicaland administrative workers, and socialised.production forthe benefit of the community was indioated to be the  objectof the movement.       The extent of the &quot;&quot;lock-in&quot; movement in September andthe neutral attitude of  the Government  brought the projectvery suddenly into the realm of praotioal politics.The prime Minister asked a joint committee  to assist  theGovernment in drafting a Bill tc give the workers a share in                                                      /the
 tne  control  of industry.   What &quot;control&quot; mean is dis--puted;  it may mean a right to inspect the books; it maymean more x,   In any oase the workers1 representatives on the  joint committee prepared two memoranda, one dealing with &quot;oontrol&quot; committees and the other with the engagement  and dismissal of workers,        (1)  &quot;Control  committees&quot;. -  Representatives of the workers,  it  was  claimed,  should have the right  to attend meetings  of  the  directorate of publio  companies f  and to have a share in the&quot;oontrol&quot; of administration, management, technical prooesees, oontraots, and finanoial operations. They should  have the right to make all enquiries necessary for  a  full understanding  of administration and to make pro- posals for the improvement of production or increase of output.  In their reports to the trade unions, reference must not  be made to secret proce s ses.        i?rom the  trade union representatives sharing in the. control of particular establishments &quot;control committees&quot; should be eleoted for each branch of industry.   These oommittees should report annually to the Minister of Industry and  commerce, to the Higher Council of Labour (which is being  converted  into an Industrial Parliament), and to the trade  unions represented on the following subjeots;-        (a) sources of capital of joint stock companies;        (b) Development of Italian industry - possibility of            conversion of capitalist into co-operative under-            takings carried on by all persons engaged in the            business; x Signor Giolitti himself declares that &quot;control&quot; in English means  &quot;participation in decisions&quot; (as to policy, etc.), while in Italian it means inspection, audit, examination forHnformation, not  a  share  in direction.  The Italian Prime Minister seeks to convince  employers that it would be well for them that the work- ers  should make  their claims in th3 light of full knowledge of the  position of  the undertaking,&apos;and that such enlightenment would  tend to remove their distrust and suspicion of the employers.   The  proposals  in the case of private firms are almost identical.
       (o) Defects  in methods of production;       (d) Wage conditions;       (e) Statistics of output and cost of production:           comparison of conditions with those of foreign           competitors;       (f) Statistics as to raw materials obtained from           abroad and the possibility of replacing them           by Italian products.      After two years any proposal to establish a new indus-try in Italy should be referred to the control committee forconsideration and report.       As will be seen below,  this project was not consideredby the Joint committee,       (2) Engagement and dismissal of workers,-  The JointCommittee met on 21st october  at Milan.   The employersasked for time to consider the &quot;control&quot; memorandum sub-mitted by the workers, and discussions began on the memorandaof the two parties as to the engagement and dismissal ofworkers.   A deadlock was reached on the question whethera worker who had appealed against dismissal should or shouldnot be allowed to remain in the works, pending a finaldecision.   The Committee met  for the last time on 9thNovember, concluding with a resolution that further dlsous-sion was useless, while eaoh side reserved the right to makea separate report presenting its own conclusions.   It  isclear that the question mentioned above was only the occasionand not the real cause of the  breakdown of the joint Committee;the parties had realised that  their respective views of themeaning of control and the method of its application wereirreconcilable.       The memoranda submitted as to the engagement and dis-missal of workers wore as follows                                               WORKERS&apos; PLAN
WORKERS1   PLAN       1. Workers  of all grades (manual, technical, clerical, etc,)  shall  be engaged  solely through Employment Exchanges managed by workers11 organisations or, where these do not exist, through Joint Exchanges; [managed jointly by employers and workers); where  no  such exohange  exists, workers shall be engaged by the managers  or  their  representatives in agreement with the workers1  representatives.          In every establishment a register shall be kept with a  record  of  the  technical  qualifications of all workers.          Workers  shall be engaged according to date of regis- tration and  technical qualifications, to the exclusion of all political and trade union  considerations,          The workers1  representatives shall be entitled to inspect the  register and to demand an explanation as to why a  worker  has been  engaged  or refused,        , In case  of shortage of work, before any workers are dismissed, hours of work shall be reduced temporarily to a minimum of 3 6 hours a week.   If this is not enough, transfers shall  be  made from one  section of the establishment to another. These  arrangements shall be made by agreement between the management and the workers1 representatives,          A  register of dismissals and of.disciplinary measures shall  be  kept and  shall be submitted weekly to the workers1 representatives  who shall  have the right to protest against any of the measures taken.          In  case of disagreement  between the management  and  theworkers1  representatives the  question  shall  be  referred  to  the organisations to which  the  parties belong.   In the meantime the measures  which have  been  disputed  shall  not come  into forco,except in  the oase of thefts  and  similar  offences.    In  seriousoases a worker may be  suspended pending the  final  deoision.
       3. The Works Committee or Council  may be  a  jointbody (i.e. composed of representatives of the three  groups;manual workers, non-manual workers and technicians)  oreach group may be represented separately.          The management shall place  an office at  their disposal.          During working hours one ox more  members  of theWorks Committee shall have the right  to remain in  thisoffice for a certain time daily to interview workers.   jforthis period each of such members shall be paid his normalaverage wage.   All other members of  the  WorksCommittee shall remain at work unless summoned to  a  special meeting or to confer with the management.   Except in specialoaseB conferences between the management  and the workers1representatives shall be held weekly  on a fixed  day  duringworking hours.       The forks Committee shall be composed in  accordancewith Section 27 of the Regulations now in force  in the metalindustry (three members for 100 workers,  5 members up t o 500,seven members up to 1,000, nine for over 1,000 workers).          The aothod  of nomination of the workers1  representa-tives shall be decided by the workers* organisations,          If at least 20 per cent, of the workers  demand itor  if there is any doubt as to which  organisation  the majorityof  the workers belong to, the elections may be held  by secretballot.                         MPLQYSfcS1 PLAS)       Joint Employment Exchanges shall be established locallyor  regionally for each industry and managed by a committeeoomposed of equal numbers of employers and workers.   Anydisputes shall be decided by arbitration.       The employers  shall engage workers solely through these                                                        exchanges
exchanges, except in the case of workers new  to thetrade and those formerly employed in the seme factory,       The. workers registered shall he placed inemployment, whether  they are members of trade unions  or not;the employers shall,be free to engage workers elsewhere ifthe exohanga oannot supply his needs.   The exchanges  shallnot register auxiliary workers or specialists (ogesaiausili&amp;ri o specialist1) nor workers employed where  there  isa strike or  A look-out.  An employer may  refuse  to  engageworkers who were formerly in their employment and weredismissed or left of their own accord.       Employers who oannot avail themselves of an employment Exchange shall engage workers directly inaooordanoe with the same rules as those laid down for  theExchanges.       Before any workers are dismissed beoause  of shortage of work, normal working hours shall be reduced to36 weekly and, if this measure is not adequate, transfersshall be made from one seotion to another.       The Works Committee shall havo the right to intervene in the oase of dismissals on disciplinary grounds,the right of the worker to notice and compensation beingforfeited.   But the employer and worker may agree to choosea contract with regular notice and compensation.    disputes between the employer and the Works Committee shall bereferred to the organisations.   Ponding the final decision,the worker  concerned may be retained  or suspended at,the discretion of the employer.        The employer shall provide offide  accommodation for the Works Committee.    The Committee  shall exercise its functions outside working hours.                     (b) Railways.        The terms of settlement of an Italian Railway  strike
in January, 1920, included  the following previsions  forworkers1 representation        (a) JPive members of the Board of Administration  of           the State Railways (Railway Beard)  will  be           elected by the workers.           The Board is tp submit rates of wages for           approval by parliament.        (b) In determining regulations for the  application  ef           the eight hour day, the Board will  consult with           three elected members for each of the three  classes           of railwaymen.        (c) In preparing new regulations, it will provide for           the establishment of lecal (presumably s joint&quot; )           commissions.       No information is yet available as to the progress made in giving effect to the above provisions.                     Ill  GEBMAflY (a) The Works Oounoil Law.        Under the German Law of 18th January,  1920, Works Councils must be set up in all establishments (including Railway Undertakings) regularly employing at least 20 workers.   (Che elections are by proportional representation; workers of 18 may vote;  and workers of 24 may be eleoted, if they have been in the industry three years and in their present employment six months.  Where                                       a the Council has more than nine members,  it must  elect from its own members a oommittee of 5 members.  Separate group Counoilsare also to be formed for manual and for non- manual workers.  Disputes in connection  with  the organisation of Works Councils or with the Assembly of all the workers are to be settled by a District  Industrial Council,        The functions of the Works Councils are as follows:-      1. TO assist in promoting efficiency;      2. To appeal, if necessary, to a Conciliation         Committee or Arbitration Board;                    tnl.e. in establishments employing 800 or more workers.                          - 12 -
     3, To negotiate as to conditions of employment;     4, To promote a good understanding between        employers and workers and to maintain  the        workers1  right of forming associations;     5, To take measures to safeguard health and        prevent acoidents;     6. To co-operate in the administration of housing,        pensions and other welfare schemes;     7, To secure from the employers information on        all matters affecting the contract  of  service  and        the activity of the workers (including the        inspection of, wages books and of quarterly        reports on production and demand for labour),     8. To be consulted on the methods to be adopted when        the engagement or dismissal of a considerable        number of workers becomes necessary.  (The        separate Councils of manual and of  n on-manual        workers are to co-operate inlaying  down  guiding        rules for the engagement of workers and  in        carrying out regulations as to the  discharge of        workers.)(b) The Coal Industry.       A Commission was appointed in January,  1919, toreport on the socialisation of coal-mines,  and another inthe spring of this year.   Two reports were issued by  thelatter at the beginning of September,   A bare majority  ofeleven members favoured a cautious and gradual procedure;a minority of ten advocated immediate and completesocialisation.
