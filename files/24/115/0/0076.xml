CAB  I II B  T.LEAGUE     OF    . NATIONS.teUW OP IKE SECRETARIAT.Report presented by fcho British Representative, Mr. A.J;Balfour, and a/ioptoa by the Council of the League  ofNations, neciinsr in Homo, on 19th Hay, 19 0.           fOirculatod for information)*    In dealing with the subject wLici: has  been entrusted  to me,namely, tho course to be adopted by tho Council as regards the secretariat oi the  -oa&amp;ue, it -will probably bo convenient ifI begin with a briox historical explanation.     Tho 3ecrotary-Genoral oi the Loaguo was appointee by theTreaty of Versailles, and not only was tho oiiiee then establish-od, but its first occupant was mentioned by name; ho is thepresent holder of the post.   His fiutios are not only of  immenseimportance, but he is tho servant 01 two masters.  He serves theCouncil of the .*ea?ue of Nations; he also  serves the Assemblyof the League of Nations    tho two Representative Bodies whoare entrusted with tho general guidance of the policy of  theLeaguo.     $hen I remind you that on his  shoulders has fallenthe chief burden of organising tho Secretariat in tho first days of our still infant institution, you will  be able to measure the importance of the responsibilities which he has to bear.     Soon after t e appointment was thus made by Treaty,  thePeace Conference, acting in plenary session, appointed aCommittee to deal with tho first Stages oi organisation.   TheCowmiv.tes represented the Mine Towers who  send representatives to the Council; Konsiour piohon, then foreign Minister of france , prosi&amp;od.   The;&apos; gave authority to the Secretary-General to make the necessary arrangements for the appointmentof a staff, and thoy also fixed the amount oi his remuneration.This remuneration, therefore, is the only  one which so fax has
been made by the full authority&apos; of the vowers assembledin Paris.     is soon as these preliminary steps were accomplishedtho 3eoretary-CJonoral set to work to collect the nucleus ofhis staff*  At tho- moment,&apos; this appeared to be a matter of pressing necessity, for the &apos; goneral anticipation was that theTreat,; of Versailles would be ratified soon after its  signa tu:and as- soon as t;.e ratification &quot;took place, the responsibilit-ies of the . .h a c ;uo and of its Secretariat would immediatelybegin.     As you are ail aware,, -these sanguine hopes weredisappointed, and while tho Treaty was signed on 28th  June,1919, it was not ratified until 10th January, 1920.  Forthis reason, the iorefcx^ht and energy of tho Secretary-General led to the creation of a staff somewhat in antici-nation of the duties which it had to -lerform.  The blame,if blame there be, for this result falls evidently notupon him, but upon the complex conditions which produced amost regrettable delay.     By the terms of the Treaty, the duty of selecting thestaff falls upon tho Secretary-General,  just as the duty ofapproving it falls upon the Council,   In making hisappointments-, he had primarily., to secure the best availablemen and women for the particular duties which had to be performed; but, in doing so, it was necessary to have  regardto the great    importance of  selecting  the officials from various nations,   Evidently, no one nation or  ?:roup ofnations ought to have a monopoly in providing the material for this  international institution,   I  emphasise the  word&quot;international&quot;, because  the members of  the Secretariatonce appointed are no longer the servants of the country ofwhich they are citizens,*but become for  the time being the servants  only  of tho League  of  Nations,-  Their duties arenot national but international,-
     One further point of importance in this connections has    4bo noted.  The International Labour Office is intimatelyconnected by its constitution and origin with tho League ofNations.   Its Director and the Secretary-General are bothalive to tho immense importance of maintaining tho closestco-operation between those two international organs and anagreement Las been reached between them by which certain of thecentral services shall be common to both institutions, .     I need iiardly p:o into details as to the constitution of the secretariat,   So far, it has not beer; found necessary tocreate more than 10 separate Sections, dealing with the variousduties entrusts-.&apos; to the League by tho Covenant, which forms part of the Treaty oi Versailles; but there can be no doubt that,-as our work increases, so the number ox those Sections will under-go corresponding augmentation.     The question of remuneration is one of considerabledifficulty.   This arise3 in part from the problems of exchangevvhich are so deeply exercising the- minds ox all those who areconcerned with International  inaneo, but it partly depends upon more permanent causes..   The problem is to find a scale of pay appropriate to the members ox an organisation who aredram from different countries, between which there prevails agreat difference in.the ordinary scale of remuneration.     It is clear on the one side that objection may be felt topaying any member of the staff a much higher salary than he would receive for work of equal difficulty and responsibility in his  -own country, and, on the other hand, it would bo most unfortunate if the scale of salaries were fired at a rate which made itimpossible to obtain first-class talent from those countries whe^ethe ordinary rata of remuneration is above  the general average. -&quot;while the final solution of this problem is not yet decided upon,.and must receive further examination, I Propose that  the council should approve  the  scale ox salaries provisionally arranged.by&apos;tho Secretary-General until the  confirmation of the Budget bytrie -assembly, ,  One or two points of  importance, still remain to
     I  surest,  that  tho Council  should  fronilrm  the apj^B*tej [j Fjment of  the members  of the  staff for  fivo years*  At  the ondof  this  period, a considerable number of thorn.will probablyhe  re-appointed, and  in many  c*ses. no  doubt, be promoted  to higher posts.   This  seems  to bo necessary,  if  only to securesmoothness and  continuity of  administration,  but at the sametime it.  is most desirable that at the end of  tho quinquennialperiod a certain Infusion of  now blood  should &quot;be secured.This will obviate .ny danger  of  the staff of  tho League ofnations  becoming as  it were a separate  bureaucratic caste.,divided  by their duties from  the. life of any  particularcommunity.  It will til so give room for  the citizens of nationsnot at present represented  on the staff to obtain in  their turn the intimate knowledge of the working of the ^eague whichwould be invaluable not only  to  the League as a whole, but tothe various nations which compose  it.,     I shall presently propose Resolutions covering,  so far asis necess...ry, these various points, but I shall also  proposetwo other lie solutions dealing with temporary  or subsidiarymatters  which have a  certain  interest or importance.  In thefirst of these Resolutions, I shall ask tho Council to approve&quot;that the provisional  seat of  tho Secretariat  shall remain  inLondon until the assembly of  tho League comes to a decision as to the date  of transfer.   It  soems quite clear that toremove the League from its provisional  seat before theAssombly meets would  be very  detrimental to its efficiency.The amount of preliminary work which the Meeting of theAssembly will throw  upon it is very great, and  it woulr] &quot;be neither  wise nor fair to add  to  these necessary labours thequite unnecessary exertions Involved in a change of residence.This requires in itself a considerable  organising effort,  andif confusion is to be wholly  avoided it would certainly be wise to await the seating  of the Assembly, and its decision as  tothe dwtes on which the movement  of the  Secretariat shouldt it-Co &apos;la c e,     lij  l^st I(osolution touches  what might at first&apos; sight  seem                              -  4 -                        to
to be only a personal issuo, but I think it is of sonieimportanoc.  I shall propose that no member of tho Secretariat,uuriug his or her term of office, shall accept any honouror decoration except for services rendered prior to theappointment.  The reasons for this proposal are fairly clear;they commend themselves, I know, to my colleagues, and I hopethe,, will commend themselves to the public.   The members ofthe staff carry out, as I have explained, not national butinternational duties,  iicthin;?&apos; should be  -one to weaken the sense of their international allegiance; the acceptance ofspecial marks of distinction or favour, either from their owner from any other country, militates, in our view, against thegeneral spirit of the Covenajit.     In accordance with these preliminary observations, I nowbeg to propose the four Hosolutions whose general character and intentions I have endeavoured to explain (See Annex),
         A O E X.                            m     307STAPF  OF  THE  SECRETARIAT.Be solutions adopted by the Council of the League of Nations,meeting in Eomo, on 19th May. 1920,I,     That in accordance with Article VI of the Covenant, bywhich the Secretaries and staff of the Secretariat shallbe appointed by the Secretary-General with the approval of theCouncil, the Council approve the provisional appointments made bythe Secretary-General acting under the authority of theOrganisation Committee of the League of Nations.   Thisapproval is given for a period of five years, dating from theday of appointment if made after the coming into force of theTreaty, and for other appointments from the date of the cominginto force of the Treaty,11*    That the salaries provisionally allotted by theSecretary-General be approved by the Council until the budgethas been confirmed by tho Assembly,,III,    That the continuance Eif the Secretariat in London,where is the present provisional seat, be authorised, and thatthe date of a transfer to the permanent seat be decided by theCouncil after the Assembly has had the opportunity ofdiscussion,IT*     That no member of the International Secretariat duringthe term of his or her appointment accept any honour ordecoration $except for services rendered prior to suchappointment).
