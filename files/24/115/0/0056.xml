CABIira.RAILWAY CONCESSIONS TO TROOPS IN THE         UKtTED KINGDOM.            (Reference, -&apos;ar Office Memo, CP,  2121)      As the War Office memorandum points ant, the RailwayConcessions In question were made before the war by the RailwayCompanies at the expense Of the Companies&apos; revenues.      The Railway Companies have definitely refused to  continuethe concessions, with the result that they have either  to ceasealtogether or to be paid for by the Exchequer, on whioh they constitute an entirely new charge.      The latter alternative means that the general taxpayer,already paying largely increased sums for his  own travelling,  hasalso to bear a part of the cost of the travelling, on leave not  on duty, of officers snd men in the Forces, frequently much betterpaid than himself,      Nevertheless the Treasury have agreed to the bulk of  thepre-war concessions io officers and men, but have declined  toextend them as i^he Service Departments asked, and hove reducedthem in the following particulars,      1*   Officers,         The concession by which officers proceeding on leaveare allowed.a return ticket on payment of single fare from certain military stations to London is limited to officers on 7 days leave.         If officers at these stations desire to run up to  townfor week-ends,  there seems no reason why they should not pay thefull railway fare.   The main object of the concession may be, asthe War Office memorandum states,  to enable officers to attendlectures on military subjects, but  I may be permitted to doubt whether that is the main use to which the concession is put.

This  concession v. as withdrawn by the Admiralty after the war,  and there seems no sufficient reason for allowing it for the wives  and children of soldiers,      Family  allowance  is now paid at liberal rates to married soldierSo      111*    As regards the minor concessions numbered 4 to 8 in the War Office memorandum&apos;,  it is not explained from what scdroe the cheap  railway tickets were paid before the war - eg. whether competitors, cr Regimental I&apos;unds,  or Royal Tournament Funds paid  in concessicn 5 - but there seems no reason why whoever paid  the cheap fare before should  not now pay the fall fare. The suggestion that &quot;actual cost&quot;  only should  be refunded to the Railway Companies&quot; appears quite impracticable, involving as it would el8.borft.te costing inquiries o      It should be s &amp;ed that the War Office have suggested (see C.P.1622) that the Railway Companies should be compelled under the Ministry of Transport Act to continue the pre-war concessions.  This might have  involved claims  for compensation to the Companies  under Section 8 (l)  of the Act on the termination of control, and the Treasury could certainly not support compulsion on the Companies, but have no objection to  any concessions which Railway Companies may voluntarily make  to theForces.
