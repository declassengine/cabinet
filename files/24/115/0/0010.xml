I             30          JSf              CABINET.       .  /The Anglo-French Petroleum Agreement and ifesopotamjLa.     ^Memorandum by the Minister in Charge of Petroleum Department.          The serious v/orld shortage of oil and the almost completedependence of this country on supplies under foreign control compelme to press the Cabinet for an immediate decision in regard to themethod of operation of the oil deposits of Mesopotamia,  I woulddirect attention to the Cabinet papers numbers CP.903, CP. 1085,CP.1118, CP.1524 and CP,1554 by the First Lord of the Admiralty,the&apos; President of the Board of -Trade and myself.   whilst no actualdevelopment can take place until the future administration ofMesopotamia is decided, it is of great importance to h*ve our policydetermined beforehand, so that valuable time may not be lost later on in discussion when prospecting and drilling sh/ruld be in fullsaving.   As I have previously pointed out, tho alternative methodsef development are:    (1)  direct Government action4    (2)  the employment of a commercial company -s the agent            of the Government:    (3)  private enterprise, the Government taking a substantial            share of the production by way of royalties.         I have already given in detail in earlier papers thereasons why it appears to the Petroleum Department that alternatives(1) and  (2) are open to serious objection.  I ask, therefore, forapproval of the method of development by private enterprise.       -  If development by private enterprise is approved, it shouldbe possible for the operating company or companies to make terms withthe Arab tribes for the protection of the oil-fields, as has beendone very successfullv in Persia.  Garrisons of Kuropean  and indian troops would, therefore, not be required for this purpose.  under such an  arrangement the Mesopotamia!! Government would, without riskor cost, obtain a substantial revenue from the fields if oil in commercial quantities were found.  The fixing of royalties on asliding  scale would also prevent excessive profits being secured bythe companies.  The right to prospect for and win oil in Mesopotamiawas granted by the Turkish Government to the Turkish petroleum company before the War, but owing to the outbreak of hostilities these rights were not exercised.  They should be recognised and confirmed.The interests in the Turkish Petroleum Company are at present held bythe Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Royal Butch Shell, and the BritishGovernment, which acquired the interest of the Deutsche Bank, thelatter having been a participant under the 1914 agreement.          If the policy of working the oil deposits in Mesopotamiathrough the Turkish Petroleum Company is approved, it is hoped thatit will be possible by a re-arrangement of the interests to bringthe Royal Dut,ch-.She 11 group under permanent British control, and Iwould ask that a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet be appointed to workout the  details of the arrangement. ..F f EF.LLAr&apos;AY.petroleum Department.      15th November, 1920.\
