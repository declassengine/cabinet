ALLOCATION OF THE EXPANSES OF THE LEAGUE OE NATIONS.                (Circulated for information.)     The Council of the League of Nations at its Brussels Meetingconsidered the Report of the Commission on the allocation of  theexpenses of the League of Nations appointed as the result of  theResolution taken at the Rome session of the Council and passed the following Resolution:        &quot;The Council having examined the Report of the  Commission         of the international Financial  conference appointed  to         consider the principles to be adopted in apportioning         the expenses of the League of Nations,  recommends  the         Assembly to appoint a Commission,  to prepare detailed,         proposals which may be used as a new basis for the         allocation of the expenses of the League&quot;.     The Assembly is invited to appoint a Committee for thispurpose at an early date.                 Report presented by the Spanish Representative                       HL Exc*  Sgnor Quinonesjie jjeonL        at the public meeting held in Brussels on the 27th  October,                                                         1980.     The Council of the Lea,?ue of Nations at its Rome Meeting,decided that the international Financial Conference of Brusselsbe asked to appoint a committee to consider the principles  onwhich the expenses of the League should be distributed among its members.     This Committee, composed of nine Members, held several  meetings in paris and Brussels.     The Committee did not find it possible to decide upon  adefinite and general basis for the final apportionment of Members1contributions.  They therefore, as a provisional measure,  for
dealing with current expenses, proposed to estimate the &quot;ability to pay&quot; of the various Members of the basis of their variouspublic revenue receipts (1913 being considered as the last normalfinancial year) and their population^  schedules of apportionmentbased on these principles vri.ll be prepared for presentation to theAssembly.     I therefore propose the following recommendation :     &quot;The Council having examined the Report of the Commission ofthe international Financial conference appointed to consider  theprinciples to be adopted in apportioning the expenses    the  Leagueof Nations,  recommends the Assembly to appoint a Commission toprepare detailed proposals, which may be used as a new baais--&apos;far\the allocation of the expenses of the League cf nations.&quot;                 INTERNATION  FINANCIAL  CONFERENCE                        BRUSSELS  1920.                      RESOLUTIONS.            OF TEE COMMITTEE!  OlS ALLOCATION OF THE EXPENSES OF                   THE LEAGUE OF  NATIONS.&apos;.&apos;V:i . .i    &apos;        -&apos;&apos;&apos;                                      &apos;/?  &quot;&quot;&apos;    &apos;&apos;&quot;      According to Article  6,  last paragraph of the  Covenant  0^ the  league  of Nations,   the  expenses of  the secretariat shall&apos; be borne by the  members  of the  league  in  aocordanoe with  the appor- tionment of the  expenses of  the  International Bureau of the Universal postal union.      in the. budget of the  Postal union a small amorlnt  only is involved,  and the  classification followed has been  readily &apos;,j-c*jpted.  with  the much larger  sums which are or may  be required by the secretariat of the  League of Nations the  classification naturally needs  closer  scrutiny  and it has indeed already formed the  subject of representations from certain of the  members.      The Council of the League,  accordingly at its  Meeting in Rome adopted  a resolution  inviting  the International Financial
Conference at Brussels to name a small  Committee  to  consider theprinciples on which the expenses of the league  should be dis-tributed among its members and to make  recommendations  for e. new basis of apportionment.     Owing to the postponement of the international  financial conference, the Council of the League at  its meeting held on the5th of August, 192oi  at San Sebastian,  requested  M.  Ador.president of that conference,  to proceed  to the appointment ofthe committee.     M. Ador accordingly appointed a committee with  the followingmembership:-     This Committee held its first meeting on September  18th  cin paris, and has since then met on several occasions both  inparis and Brussels.  According to the Resolutions  passed by theCouncil of the League of Nations at its meeting held in  Rome  towhich reference has already been made, the committee,  while mthe one hand definitely asked to prepare recommendations as tothe principles on which the new apportionment should be  made, wason the sther hand,  definitely informed that no &quot;schedules ofapportionment&quot; should be prepared based on the principles it  laiddown.     The resolution adopted by the council of the  League ofNations held at Rome assumed that an amendment to  the Covenantwould be necessary to permit of the adoption of any new  classifi-cation for the distribution of the expenses.  As,  however,  it seemed possible that an alteration in the covenant might presentcertain difficulties, the committee prior to any final decision in the matter thought it advisable through the Swiss DelegateM.

on the committee-, - unofficially to ask the sv/iss&quot; Federal.. Council,...which exercises the supervision over the postal Union,  whethera revision of the existing classification of the members of thesaid union would be possible were a request officially put before the Federal Council. 1 In reply to this enquiry the Corn-mi ttee has received the following telegram:                                                 to     &quot;I am authorised by the s^lss Federal Council/inform        &quot;you that in the event of the Financial conference        &quot;requesting the bureau of the International Universal        &quot;Postal Union to investigate the possibility of        &quot;revising the present apportionment of the expenses        &quot;of this Bureau amongst the adhering countries in        &quot;such a manner as to conform more exactly to the        &quot;capacity of each country to pay, the Federal Council        &quot;exercising its right.of supervision r.ver the Bureau        &quot;rail be happy to lend their good offices for this        &quot;purpose.  The Federal Council do net doubt that it        &quot;will prove possible after a short space of time to        &quot;obtain a more equitable system of apportionment        &quot;which may serve as a. has:&apos;.s for the allocation of        &quot;the expenses of the League of $rations in conformity        &quot;with Article 6 of the covenant.  This apportloiimeirt        &quot;would be based on the indices proposed by the        MCommit tee of experts appointed by the League of        &quot;Nations to examine the question.&quot;     It will thus be noted that it seems possible to obtain a revision of the existing classification employed by the postalUnion in accordance with proposals that may be put forward bythe financial conference.     After some discussion-rf alternative principles including-equality of contributions and assessment proportioned to expendi-ture on armaments,  the committee came to the conclusion that thebasis of apportionment which could most equitably be followedis that of ability to pay.  As the most accurate criterion ofability to pay they would have preferred to adopt the national income of each member state.  Unfortunately statistics ofnational income are at present available only in the case of somesix member states, and even in these cases the statistics arehardly comparable.  In the same way the estimates of national wealth, the next best index of capacity to pay. are availableonly for very few member - states and are subject to the sa.meobjections as in the case of national income.  The Committee hasalso ne hope that comparable figures of national income or ef
national&apos; wealth will &quot;be. available for many years to come.   TheCommittee, therefore,  examined various criteria which were suggested for this purpose,. i.e.     National revenue,, population,  &quot;budget receipts, area,  trade-external as well as internal - the postal statistics,  etc     None of the criteria for which data were available for allcountries met with general acceptance.  Moreover,  apart the factthat statistics are in many cases not prepared on a. uniformbasis,  the present economic condition of most countries is at thepresent time abnormal, and&apos;- it is in the circumstances a taskcf great difficulty to devise any. formula which will not havean inequitable result for one or more.members of the League.     It would be easy to show,&apos; that in-the&apos;case of certainoountrie-:;, such as India and china, the adoption of populationalone as a basis would be unfair.  Area alone as a criterionwould be unjust, for example to those states of south Americawhich have large uncultivated territories.  Foreign trade  wouldbe unjust to members,  not in themselves wealthy,- having a  largeturnover with foreign countries.  As regards the national  budget,certain functions in some oases.ffoiin a charge to the central Goverh-ment, while elsewhere similar&apos; functions are paid for from    federalor municipal revenue.  There is in faot no subsidiary criterionagainst which legitimate&apos; criticism has not been directed.   Allthese considerations,- and more particularly the abnormal&apos; situa-tion of most countries at the: present, time,, point  to the conclusionthat any  revised apportionment.now made should be  strictlytemporary.     For  such a provisional. allocation the Committee recommends:     (a) That net public revenue receipts  for 1913, the lastnormal financial year, and population should be taken intoaccount as indices of ability&apos;  to pay.  This general formula-would,however, be subject to the  qualification&apos; that the  populationindex should in no case exceed that .of the&apos;E^european member ofthe League possessing&apos; the largest population,&apos;- and  that allowance
should similarly he made for any other  exceptional  circumstances&quot;by the council of the League of Nations either  on its  own initiative or on the special application of the country  concerned.     ^fte&apos; committee had -not had time  to  explore  fully the relative importance to be assigned to population and net revenue  butconsiders that suitable index numbers would be  obtained  by takingthe percentage of each country&apos;s population and net revenue  tothe aggregate population and net revenue respectively  for all members of the League.     (b) That the system in use by the  postal Union Of groupingcountries into classes under which each Nation  is charged withcertain units and the number of units assigned  to each classremain unchanged, but that in place  of  the  present  method of assessment the indices referred to above be combined for thepurpose of this grouping,  such classification  into a  seriesof groups would in any case be desirable owing  to the  factthat the available statistics can at best only  afford  a  very rough measure of relative ability to pay.  Where political.boundaries have changed since 1913 revenue  figures  would beroughly distributed on a population  basis.     The committee does not consider that the above scheme should remain in force for more than a  very limited periodwithout further examination, and it  recommends  that, if  apermanent financial commission is appointed, one of the  tasksshould be the elaboration of a more  scientific  basis of assessment.
