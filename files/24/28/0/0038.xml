E233li A E     CAB I HE I.2238.       AJJJHIAL OPERATIONS (WAR PRIORITIES) COMMITTEE.Proposal that the Minister of national Service be appointed a menbgjN *(i) Copy of letter from Secretary, national Servioe Ministry to Secretary, War Cabinet.(ii) Note by General Smuts.(i)Copy of letter dated 29th September 1917, from Secretary, National Service Ministry to Secretary, VJar Cabinet,Sir,I am directed by the Minister of National Service to refer to the Minutes of the War Cabinet (No. 237, Minute 6), of the 21st September, directing the formation of a Committee to enquire into the conditions prevailing in the manufacture of aircraft, and to report on the whole situation, giving their recommendations as to priority and the effect that any priority, dif granted, would have on the output for the Army and Navy, and in what direction.Although the request for priority is apparently limited to priority for materials, it is clear that this cannot be considered apart from the question of priority for labour; and, indeed, the question of the quantity and quality of the labour engaged in aero-plane engine works appears, according to the Minutes, to have been discussed by the Cabinet.As the proceedings of the Committee may involve important rocommendations affecting the allocation of man-po?/er and the prior-ity to be given to aircraft requirements, and in view of this, and the large demands which are being, and are likely to be made on man-power in this connection, the Minister considers that the question is one which vitalljr affects the Ministry of National Service.&amp;     In these circumstances. the Minister desires you to submit to the^Var Cabinet that it is eminently desirable that he should be appointed a Member of the Committee.I am. etc., (Sd) E.A. Sandford Fawcett.(ii)Note by General Smuts,I consider the addition of the Minister of National Service to the VJar Priorities Committee would be unnecessary and lead to confusion.   He is a leading member of the Man-Power Committee whose functions are distinct from the War Priorities Committee.   I am afraic5 his appointment to both would tend to confuse the functions of the two.   At present I am a member of both Gommittees and I consider that sufficient in the way of a connecting link.8th October 1917.(Sd) J.C. Smuts.
