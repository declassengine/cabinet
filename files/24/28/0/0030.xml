zCISECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. DGW/012.WEEKLY REPORT ON GREECE, XII.(5 October, 1917).The Greek Chamber was adjourned on September 3 and was to re-assemble on October 1.   The debates at the end of August were dealt with in the last Report.   They were wound up by Mr Venizelos, v;ho spoke for a great part of the sittings cf August 26 end 27. It is to be hoped that his speech will be published in full in an English translation, for it contains a mass of interesting first-hand information - at times perhaps coloured - on international politics and diplomatic negotiations during the last five years.     As was mentioned in the last Report, as a conse-quence of Mr Venizelos&apos; brilliant statement of the consistency of his own policy and the disasters in Ttfhich his opponents had involved Greece, a large number of deputies, in the Chamber have now joined the party.     TheBe include not merely such time-servers as the Turkish and Jewish Macedonian deputies, but also a certain number of Independents who have hitherto been anti-Venizelist. Mr Stratos, the new leader of the Opposition, would seem to have made a tactical mistake in refusing to recognise the legitimacy and moral justifications for the Revolution.     He would perhaps have been acting more wisely had he founded his new party on the basis of some other programme.      At least, however, like every politician and newspaper In.Greece at the present moment, he is necessarily emphatically in favour of supporting the Government in all such measures as they will be forced to take in defence of the international interests of Greece and in furtherance of the war, on vnich Greece has entered in alliance with the Entente Powers.     Possibly,now that the preliminary debates on the policy
of King Constantine and that cf Mr Vendselos have been finished, the Chamber on re-assembling will be able to turn its attention to other matters, especially of internal politics, on which the Opposition may be able to find a better issue between themselves and the Government.Enquiries into Abuses.The Commissions appointed to try those responsible for the outrages committed under the various anti-Venizelist Governments are all sitting and proceeding with the work of investigation. The ecclesiastical tribunal of bishops, under the presidency of the Metropolitan of Saloniki, is dealing with the case of the Metropolitan of Athens and the other ecclesiastics implicated in the anathema ceremony and other political offences.       Two Commissions are at work investigating the charges against the Slfcouloudhis and Lambros Governments, and a third will probably be appointed to try the members of the Ghounaris Government with the exception of Mr Zoghraphos, former Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was suggested that measures should be taken to bring Mr Ghounaris and other anti-Venizelist Ministers accused of unconstitutional practices back to Greece from Corsica, but this has now been decided against.       A further Commission is sitting to investigate the applications for indemnification made by Venizelists who suffered personal and pecuniary damage from the agents of the old regime, especially during the progroms of December last. The press announces that some 4,000 applications have already been made.     The money to indemnify these victims will probably be raised by an internal loan.
The Financial Situation.When the Chamber meets the Minister of Finance, Mr Negro-pondis, will lay before it the 1916 and 1917 Budgets, in the latter of which will be incorporated the financial statement of the former Provisional Government at Saloniki.     The 1918 Bud^get is also being prepared and will before long be laid before the Chamber.     The financial embarrassments in whioh the old regime involved Greece have naturally caused the Government considerable anxiety.   A warm welcome was extended to M. Sergeant, Director-General of the Bank of France, who during September paid a visit to Athens to investigate the financial situation.     Great satisfaction is expressed with the loan of 100,000,000 francs to the Greek Government made jointly by the British and French Governments.     On the basis of the 50,000,000 francs lent by the British Government the National Bank will be empowered to issue notes up to 100,000,000 dhrakhme.   An internal loan of 25,000,000 francs has already been floated and covered.The economic situation is still serious, but considerable alleviation is hoped in consequence of the readiness expressed by the British Government to take as much of   the currant crop as can be transported.   The press wae delighted to report the news that the Allies&apos; Central Provisioning Bureau had promised to do everything possible in the way of victualling Greece. In order to deal with the urgent food question Mr Venizelos has temporarily abandoned the portfolio of Minister of War to General Dhanghlis in order personally to supervise the Ministry of Supplies.     The Greek Government is determined to do everything possible for the relief of the poorer citizens and has promised
to proceed to drastic taxation of the wealthier classes and especially of all war profiteers.Martial Law.Martial law, which at first was only proclaimed in the nomes of Attica and Boeotia, was extended on September 8 to that of Messinia, and a few days later (as from September 21) to those .of Lakonia and Arcadia (in the Pelopcnnese) and Larissa in Thessaly, and (as from September 29) to Argolis and Corinthia. At the same time the press is subjected to official supervision with regard to the reporting of debates in the Chamber, which are only to be given in the words of the official r sum&amp; of the debates passed by the President of the Chamber.Administrative Reforms.When once the urgent question of purifying the Church andthe judicial and civil administration of untrustworthy andtraitorous elements has been concluded, for which object theLaw of the Immovability of Public Servants has been provisionallysuspended, the Government has promised to proceed to the electionof a National Revisionist Assembly.     In spite of the strongRepublican currents prevalent in the rank and file of theVenizelist party, Mr Venizelos himself has several times statedthat he is determined, if possible, to preserve the Monarchyso long as the King will clearly recognise that he is but thecrowned President of a Republic.     Meanwhile, two reforms ofsome political importance will shortly be introduced:(1) The deputies of the Aegean Islands have signed a petition in favour of administrative decentralisation. They wish the institution of administrative councils for the Islands which will meet twice a week and settle all questions of merely local importance
b owithout the necessity of submit ting them to the central authorities.     Macedonian, Epirote and Cretan deputies are also in favour of these plans of decentralisation.(2) The Provisional Government at Saloniki had already decided in favour of agrarian reform in New Greece and the substitution for the system of large holdings by a system of peasant proprietorships.     The same question now arises with regard to Thessaly.       So long ago as . 1911 Mr Venizelos had taken up the idea of expropriating the landlords in Thessaly and dividing up the land into small peasant holdings.     This promise was the main reason for the support accorded to the Venizelist cause by the bulk of the population in Thessaly, and Mr Mikhalakopoulos (Minister of Agriculture) has now promised to proceed as soon as possible with the carrying out of this reform.Relations with the Entente Powers.Official telegrams show that the French Military Commission, consisting of about 80 French officers, is expected to begin work on the training of the Greek Army in October, and General Braquet hopes that he will have ten divisions of the Greek Army ready early next year.    The British Rear-Admiral who is in command of the British Mission for training the Greek Navy has been assured of the executive control of the Navy under the Greek Minister of Marine, Admiral Koundouriotis.     Italian officers will once again take charge of the training and reorganisation of the gendarmerie, of which till 18 months ago they were at the head.Epirus.During the first weeks of September the Italian evacuation of Epirus continued.   On September 10 the Greeks re-occupied Pargha; on September 12 Metsovon;   on September 15 Philiatas;   and on September 22 Yannina.     The Italians, however, Insist on maintaining their occupation of Konitsa and some villages to the north of it as well as certain posts above the Santi Quaranta Road.     The Greek Government is prepared to acquiesce in the arrangement provided that
the proper exercise of Greek civil authority is not interfered with. It is, however, suspicious cf the appointment of Italian Vice-Consulates in Northern Epirus, as (apparently) it is thought that these are likely to &quot;become centres of anti-Greek propaganda among the Albanian and Koutso-Vlakh population.     On the whole, however, the language of the Greek press on the subject of Italij, is very much more friendly, and the moderate and impartial tone always adopted by Mr Venizelos himself with regard to Greco-Italian relations is fortunately being imitated by the press of all parties.The Greeks in Bulgaria and Turkey.The revelations of the Greek White -Book [which has already been the subject of a detailed Report by this Bureau, September 17] show that the Bulgarian authorities have been systematically eliminating the Greek element from Eastern Macedonia.   Up till April 28, 6,000 persons had died cf starvation in Kavalla, and the situation in Dhrama and Serres was similar.     By refusing the Greek population food and employment the Bulgarian authorities have succeeded in forcing them to migrate into the centre of Bulgaria and Dobrcgea.Far worse has been the lot of the Greeks of the Turkish Empire. On August 20 Mr Politis, Minister of Foreign Affairs, laid before the Chamber four documents shewing that since January 1915 the Turkish authorities, at the instigation of the Germans, had proceeded with the systematic massacre and deportation of the Greeks of Asia Minor, beginning with those on the Aegean   coast, and subsequently extending their work of destruction to other parts.     Their procedure in the case of the Greeks is absolutely parallel to that in the case of the Armenians,     The Messager d&apos;Athenes on September 15 calculates that 1,000,000 Greeks in the Turkish Empire
11 sX JL tjhave been wiped out:   that is to say half the Greek population of Turkey.   This certainly reads as a gross exaggeration, but it would be impossible to deny that after all it may be true.     What is certain is that the Greek population of certain towns has been almost entirely removed and nothing is known about the fate of the wretched people who have been deported.   Further evidence on the point is being given by Messrs Naoum and Kalleryis, the Ministers in Constantinople who have just returned to Greece, and the Greek Government has promised to publish at least part of their reports on the fate of the Greek population of Bulgaria and Turkey. It is interesting that as In the case of the Armenians, the instigators of this work of wholesale destruction appear to have been the Germans, and especially Marshal Liman von Sanders.5.10.17. . - AWAL.
