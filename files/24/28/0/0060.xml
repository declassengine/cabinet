Their services were equally energetic end equally valuable throughout the SOMME fighting last year and in all the fighting which has taken place this year.I desire to take this opportunity of conveying my opinion on another question relating to the good work, of the Royal Flying Corps, regarding which General Trenchard informs me that you spoke to him on his recent visit to London - i.e.,, the question of publishing in the.newspapers the names of pilots who do specially good work.The matter has had careful consideration in France for a long time, as a result of which the General Officer Commanding Royal Flying Corps, with my full approval, is entirely averse to any such publication.&quot;;hen a member of the Royal Flying Corps performs specially brilliant feats his name is brought to notice for reward, as in the. case of all other branches of the Service, and the grant of the reward or honour granted to him by the King is duly published, together with a statement of the deeds for which it has been granted.General Headquarters,British Army in the Field. 7th October, 1917,
I am strongly of opinion that it would he &quot;froth unwise policy and unfair to other branches of the Service to differentiate the treatment of the Royal Plying Corps in this.manner from that which applies to the Army generally. Any such special treatment would be invidious and likely to cause justifiable jealousy,  both inside and outside the Plying Corps.   The fact that it is done in the case of certain other Armies would not justify a departure   from the well established customs of the British Army,  and I feel sure that the best opinion in the Royal Plying Corps itself would not be in favour of a syst-u which is not in accordanoe with the traditions of the British Army &quot;but. on the contrary,  that the Officers of the Royal Plying Corps are proud cf being anonymous like their comrades in other branches of the Service.I may add that the work of the Royal Plying Corps is now carried out so much in formationsrather than individually that it would frequently be impossible  to select special individuals for particular mention.    I would also add that, while the gallantry and the sple&amp;Md w,ork cone by the members of the Royal Plying Corps are worthy of the highest praise,  the members of various ether branches of the Service display no less gallantry and fre-quo ntly endure even greater hardships and heavier losses.I request that the report on the work of the Royal Plying Corps enclosed herewith may not. be published,  at any rate without careful censorship,  especially the secret information and figures relating to the German Plying CorpShould it be considered advisable,  however,  to forestall airr press agitation an regards the publication 6f names of individual members of the Royal Plying Corps, I have no objection to my opinion being made known.(Sd.)

MEMORANDUM OJ THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE ROYAL FLYING CORPS LURING SEPTEMBER WITH SOME NOTES ON THE WORK OF THE GERMAN FLYINGCORPS oLuring the month of September an intense and unceasing battle in the air has heon going on day and night intimately connected with the operations on tho ground, out unlike them in this respect, that they knew no lull nor respite except those caused when the weather made flying quite impossible.   And even when the weather was such as is generally regarded as impossible for flying, if operations were taking place on the ground flying was carried cut all the same.When the SOMME offensive came to an end     documents were captured from the Germans written by the German Higher Command in which it was said that.the only way to defeat the English in the air was to fellow their example and to take the offensive and to fight the enemy over his-linesvTho Germans adopted this principle.   They imitated our offensive methods and went even as far as to translate and to use our orders for contact patrols between aircraft and the infantrjT- without making a change in them,:When operations began again this year at ARRAS our machines co-operated with the infantry by flying&apos; lew and taking part in the battle with tho infantry.    The Germans followed suit and did the same thing latereBut there was still one element of air-warfare in which they were far behindhand, and this was bombing-.,   Until this summer they did little night bombing and still less d.ay bombing.   But it was foreseen as far back as last year that they were bound to follow our example in this as in othor branches of air-warfare because it was clear that if we bombed the German forces and their oeali-ks and billets behind the lines that the German Army would some day or other compel their Flying Corps to retaliate,-    It would be useless for instance, for the German Flying Corps to say that they regarded night, bombing as useless or the advantage gained too slight corn-pared with the losses incurred and the expense in machines, if the German Army had before them the object lessen of our machines bombing day and night end inflicting damage on them and losing hardly any ma chines by so doing-,   &quot;They ended by following our exampleThe recent bombing raids during September carried out by the Germans in England and in the North of France, on our front and behind our lines was the inevitable answer, and the retaliation for what we ha-ve been doing to the Germans during the last 12 months.Luring the last month the German bombing on our front has been severe,,   It is an easy task for the GerEan machines to fly down the Coast and bombard DUNKIRK and any of our units near the Coastc    The result is they have bombed DUNKIRK and the neighbouring places occupied by English troops on every possible opportunity^
elThey inflicted considerable damage on the Headquarters of the R.N.A.S. and destroyed the whole of the engine shed and workshops, wiping out many spare engines, by a lucky bomb.^ In addition they have done considerable damage at CALAIS, in-flicted many casualties at AODRlCQ,,. killed six R.F.C. officers and many men at different Flying Corps Stations, bombed several hospitals causing casualties to nurses and patients, and they also did considerable damage and caused many casualties at POPERIKGHE,     In fact, the bombing by the enemy last month was the severest we have yet been subjected to, and the total casual-ties including soldiers and civilians is large while the material damage was fairly great.The Germans have done this during September, only when the weather has been fine, but our Naval and Military aircraft have &quot;bombed the Germans day and night,  in moonlight and darkness and in fine weather   and bad weather,  and the amount of damage caused by the Germans is small compared with what has been done by us.Bare figures tell more plainly than anything elseDuring the month of September226 bomb raids were carried out by the R.F.C., eachraid of 6 to 12 machines, and 572 - 112 lb. bombs 347 - 230 lb. bombs 6342 -    25 lb. bombs and32 - Phosphorous bombs were dropped besides other small bombs making a total of 7886 bonrfoe dropped daring the -month and 135 tons of explosive.As far as we know from the reports from places behind our lines the Germans have dropped 969 bombs on us, but sometimes places merely report bombs dropped without being able to specify the number.The figures with regard to the other branches of fighting in the air are no less eloquent :-During the month of September :-7964 hostile batteries have been engaged with aerial observation.l8l3 hostile batteries were successfully disposed of. 628 other targets were engaged for effect. 947 othertargets were ranged on.Making a total of 9539 targets ranged with aerial observation.It is interesting to note that the number of German batteries ranged during September was only 743, with aerial and wireless observation.In.connection with this workI4678 plates were exposed most of which were satisfactory and 346999 photographs were distributed.
During the month:-9209 offensive patrols, 1945 artillery patrols, 113 contract patrols with the infantry on the ground during battles, and 60 oounter attach patrol a were carried out. 583 night flights were carried out and 1330 special-missions.- Work. of.such intensity and of so relentless and unremitting a nature is necessarily a heavy drain on the supply of machines and tho repair of machines.In Prance there are two large Depots which feed the Squadrons at the front.During the month of September:-930 machines were standardised and issued te Squadrons from the two ;;J)epots and116 machines were completely reconstructed. (Reconstructionon an average takes from a fortnight to a month).113 machines were erected.This often entailed the mechanics at these Depots working day and night.The result of this fighting and this work, the value of the offensive in the air, has been proved by the following facts: -- At the beginning of September the Germans concentrated in great forces on our front and wereactive over our lines,  and their low flying machines were fairly numerous.   But, towards the end o$/the month the majority of the German machines were found miich further back behind their lines, although a number came over the line.Most important of all, thanks to the offensive action of the fighting patrols, the artillery machines were able to   carry out their work of ranging unmolested by the enemy during the, battles of the 20th.and 26th. September,With regard to the bombing, we do not as a rule hear details of the results obtained until some time afterwards. Photography, however,  enables us to check some of the results immediately and very often the damage revealed by the camera does not dicolose all the damage done.For instance, a large Hangar at RAMEGIJIES OHIU Aerodrome was hit&apos;by a 230 lb, bomb on a day in July and destroyed.    The aerodrome was photographed afterwards, and the hangar was no longer- there.   Sometime afterwards information reached us from other sources to the effect that twenty machines were completely burnt.
On clear days the work Is carried out by fast machines which bomb in the daytime the targets which have already been bombed the night before by the night flying squadronsDuring the month of September 139 German machines were claimed to have been brought down and destroyed by the Flying Corps In the Field and 13 by gun fire and infantry,, and 122 were driven down out of control, making a total of 274 machines, This includes the valuable work done by the Naval Squadrons attached to the R.F.C.I-IQTE. When a pilot reports that a machine is driven down outof control it means not merely that he has driven off the hos-tile machine, but that he considers it is hors de combat, only he has not been able to see it destroyed on the ground or con-firmed .     The number of machines claimed to have been driven down out of control is cut down ever 50/c.      (The Germans make no   such distinction in their claims between those machines brought down and those driven down out of control).In this short summary nothing has been said about indl-vidual fights.     In order to realise the frequency and the intensity of these during a period when battles are being either fought on the ground or prepared for, it is necessary to read the records of the Squadrons themselves .,Attached to this paper is a copy of .the weekly Flying Corps Communique s&quot;*&apos;during the last month which are issued for the purpose of keeping- pilots in the Flying Corps informed as to what their comrades are doing.       These give in an abridged form a slight idea of the epic battles which take place In the air every day and all day during such operations .* Not reproduced .   Will be circulated separately .5th October, 1917
