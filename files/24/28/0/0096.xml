A fow weeks after the United States entered the ?;ar a long series of telegrams coming through a large number of different channels reached the Air Board on different matters connected with aviation.     Further, a series of visitors from the United States, comprising Officers of the Signal Corps and men of scientific attainment, came to this country asking for information which in many cases involved duplication and overlapping.As a result of this the Air Board cabled to the American Aircraft Production Board in America asking thata fully authorised representative should come to Europe and thereby avoid aviation matters being dealt with&apos;through diverse channels.As a result Col. Boiling was specially appointed to represent the American Aircraft Board in Europe and since his arrival here his appointment has been confirmed as Chief in Charge of aviation matters behind tho lines of communication.Col. Mitchell is in charge of American aviation questions at the Front.Immediately on Col. Boiling1s arrival here,  the Air Board put forward certain recommendations covering;-1.       Tho necessity for the American Aircraft Frodnc-tion Board to take no action which \?ould interfere withcontracts already made in America for the carrying out of our British Programme.2.       The American Aircraft Production Board would assist with American su,plies as regards acceleration of tho British Programme,, this referring largely to the supply of raw material and finished parts.  .3.       That the American Aircraft Production Board would adopt for construction in America, a programme of types of engines and aeroplanes from which the American Aerial Fleets would be constructed.In recommending this Programme insistence was laid on the necessity of having only a small number of types, and considerable care was devoted to tho selection of those types irrespective of the origin of the design, so that in each case the very best typo known to our ex-perience was recommended.4.       It was pointed out   to    Col. Bulling that care should be exercised towards keeping down the tonnage required for shipment of aeroplanes to Europe by shipping those aeroplanes in parts and assembling in France.nhen Col. Boiling arrived in this country he was accompanied by 60 or 70 engineers and by a number of well-known Tforks Managers of Industrial establishments in America.Opportunity was given to all these people to spend a considerable time in British, French and Italian &quot; factories, and it is understood, that benefiting by this experience, they have now returned to America to make practical use of such experience gained.
After hearing the views of the British Air Board, Col. Boiling visited Prance and Italy and finally settled in Paris which he made his Headquarters.On Col. Boiling1s visits to Franco and Italy, he soon established that the facilities in those countries for the production of aeroplanes and aero-engines were not being fully or efficiently utilised.In the case of France, by reason of vacillating constructional policy of tho successive aviation Ministries coupled with a shortage of labour and material , and in Italy solely associated with lack of raw material and fuel.Col. Boiling then adopted the extremely wise expedient of deciding to have for next Spring and early Summer a fleet of machines.for tho United States Army, built and equipped in France and Italy.     fo enable this to bo carried out he has engaged to supply all the raw material and to provide American soldier mechanics to the French Army to enable the release of the requisite French meohanios for the French Aviation workshops.The orders placed by Col. Boiling in France airi Italy are as follows:-High Speed Day Bombing machines.1500 Breguet type to be built in France. 500 S&apos;, I.A. machines to be built in Italy.Heavy Might Bombing Machines.200 Caproni machines to be built in Italy.Flghtina Machines.Hew2000 Spad type and 1500/Spad type or Meuports to be built in Franee.The Engines for these machines will be:-1500 Renaults .300 h.p. 4000 Hispanos. 3000 Gnomes. 1500 Fiats.and the requisite Isotta Fraschini engines for the Caproni machines.Delivery of these machines and engines has been promised to Col. Boiling by the 30th Juno, 1918.With regard to training of pilots, we understand that this is proceeding vigorously io  waGrica but is being handicapped by lack of machines.     It must be understood that such training is only of an elementary character on elementary machines as there are no advanced or War training machines in America at present.
A considerable number .cf American pilots are n*w being trained in England, prance and Italy and a special American school for pilots is being arranged in France and 3one machines have been lent to the Americans by the French Govern ment for thi3 purpose.Tho different arrangements affecting supply and to a certain extent the policy arranged between the British Air Board and Colonel Boiling are recoraed in a private letter from me to Colonel Boiling,  a copy of ^hich is annexed.This letter was written unofficially as Colonel Boiling was anxious not to make any definite agreement with the British Air Board of a written character which might be outside nis powers and questioned by the American Aircraft Production Board.I need hardly say that these arrangements have not been fully acted up to in practice probably due to the im-possibility of Colonel Boiling being able to convey to the Washington authorities the complex conditions surrounding aviation supply and aviation experience in Europe,  together with a natural desire of the Washington authorities to develop a policy of their own.A copy of the letter of the 4th August was Brent to Brio:.-General Comack,  the representative of the Aeronauti-cal-Supplies Department of the Ministry of Munitions and of the Air Board in America, who acts under Sir Charles Gordon and Lord Northcliffe, and Bri^.-General Cormack cables the following picture of the situation at present obtaining in America; -&quot;Re agreement of 4th Auz-^ust.1. Reports will be made regarding all these matters as soon as possible- but indications are that we are not receiving priority necessary.2. Situation already reported.3. Training Engines.

Stop.   Large orders for the former are about to be placed.   Stop,   The result is that no money is available for alter-native engines.   Stop.   Rolls Royce has been de-finitely turned down by the United States of America and &apos;-;o steps are bein-: taken with regard to B.H.P.

Stop,Attempts are being made to alter existing ciders and secure early transportation of some 3(/000. elementary pilots and 15,000 mechanics,5.     Authorities here are not yet convinced that transportation cf complete aeroplanes in large numbers is impossible,6,     At present the only engines which we could obtain here at the rate of 500 per month commencing January are me Liberty 8 and 12 motors.7.     Very doubtful whether 300 training machines oer month can be obtained after March unless Willys production is quick; and considerable^8.     Arrangements have been made for supply of machine guns from here .9.     No information is yet available as to the probable deliveries of material to France for motors being built there, but the steel situation is very critical and is at present receiving earnest consideration of Authorities,      St.jp, Very desirable that great effort should be male to provide material from England to France so as to secure our motors there.     Stop,10,   Have seen now Liberty motors 8 and \Z cylinder assembled and dissemble^ but not runningu       Stop,,Full official figures promises, also opportunity of seeing test.       Stop*       Consider many points require attention but will report later..    Stopc     Lolco ignition is used  -and seems good and we are asking for 2 sets to be sent to England.&quot;From this it will be seen that in the essential matter of priority we are not obtaining everything that is required but as each case arises it is being taken up by us through Colonel Boiling vigorously.The great departoe that America has made is in the design and manufacture cf tho Liberty motor., and if this motor troves a success, there is no doubt it will be a very great factor not only in building up a large American Programme, but also in assisting us in our ProgrammeAt
present the utmost that can be said is that the motor promises well, but there is no reason to doubt that it will have to come through all the teething troubles of all new aero-motors.   On the other hand, when it is ready for production it will undoubtedly be produced in very large numbers due to the enormous facilities available,v,&apos;ith regard to the actual number of aeroplanes being built in America for shipment tc Europe, we as yet have no definite information.   Accordingly., no definite forecast can be made of the number of aeroplanes to be constructed in America for use in Europe which will be delivered in Europe in the early Spring,As regards the American Programme of European con-struction, I do not thirk it would be safe to estimate completion by June of much more than 50$ of the promised numb er.About 6 weeks a^o the British Air Board cabled to America that they could recommend the Handley -Page machine as recently modified, for construction in America as heavy night bombers and Brig-General Cormack and Colonel Boiling have both informed me during this week that 1000 of these machines have been put in hand.If the Liberty Motor comes rapidly through its develop-ment period, I would anticipate considerable deliveries of D.H.9. East Day Bombers and BAP, Heavy Bombers flcm America in the late Spring and early SummercThe Spruce situation as regards America is of great importance and at a conference held with Colonel Boiling and with representatives from Great Britain, France and Italy, held in Paris last week, a definite allocation between the different countries v/as cabled to Washington   Such allo-cation provided for 50^ of the Spruce to be delivered to Great Britain;With regard to procedure under vhjch the Allies will obtain supplies from America in the future, it has been suggested by Colonel Boiling that all such demands should, pass through his office before transmission to America. However, in view of the somewhat indefinite and varied arrangements obtaining as regards ordering in America, no definite action has yet been taken in regard to this point, and we are ordering our American supplies through the Ministry of Munitions1 representatives in  -merica as in the past.With regard.to the full utilisation of American facilities for the construction of aeronautical material, an interesting development has taken place.     With regard to the facilities of Mr.- Henry Ford, apparently Mr. Ford is desirous of building aeroplanes and engines outside of the control of the American Aircraft Production Board in rashington0     This may be due to the fact that the American Aircraft Production Board is con-stituted largely of Detroit Motor Car Manufacturers and on account of Mr. Ford&apos;s personal characteristics.     I discussed this with Colonel Boiling and have cabled to Brige-General Cormack to take up with the Chairman of the American Aircraft Production Board, the possibilities of our being allowed to
dgal direct with Mr. Ford and if Ibis permission be granted to establish what idr building country;will be made to the MinisterFordfs proposals would be in regard to a certain type of aeroplane and engine for this on the receipt of this report a further reportas I do not think we can affordto ofneglectthethe very large Ford Company.facilities and capable organisationGenerally speaking, the advent of America in the War has up till now rather been a hindrance to the carrying out of our own aeronautical Programme than otherwise, and it is ho^ed that this interference may be more than counterbalanced by&quot;the addition of AmericaTs own American and European built fleets of aircraft.(Signed)   W.

4th August. 1917,Dear Major Boiling,Confirming our meetings and conversations since your arrival in Europe and including our meeting with Mr. Churchill and *ord Oowdray yesterday, I think you will agree that it is desirable that come record should ho mado to show the arrangements and agioomonts wo have como to, and I trust the following expressos these, together with the spirit in which the moaoti&amp;tions have bean conducted.As arranged v?ith you, I have cent a copy of this letter to Mr. Churchill and also to the Air Board, so that the different Departments concerned are fully informed, so that their future policy will bo based on this record of our joint understanding.(1)     It is agreed that your Aircraft froduotion Board thoroughly appreciate the necessity of doing everything in their power to secure prompt execution of all our present and future contracts for aeronautical supplies from the United Statos.   These embrace our contracts with Curtiss on OX 5 motorc for training purposes, as regards which we are relying on the completion of 2,000 of theso motorc not later than 30th March 1918,    There- awo contracts for flying boats with the Curtiss Company and what over portion of the *vork being done in the United Scarce in connection with the *7illys; Overland Company&apos;s contract for 1,000 Sunbeam motors.   In addition^ there arc vory important contracts for crankshafts, A.G.S. parts, ballbearings, alloy steol, and other similar contracts.With reforonco to the ball bearings, your-cablegram states that your Board anticipate some difficulty in arranging tho supply and as decirod I enclose yen a list of what is wanted.(2)     V.ith reference to tho important question of silver spruce, it is n derstood that your Aircraft Iroduction Board are now developing an oxtensivo schome for cutting down this timber end for its cutting out in tho sawmills.   On acoount of tho necessity of saving- shipping space, we .dll arrange for our timber demands of silver spruce in tho United Statos to be conveyed to your aircraft Production Board in the form of schedules giving the sections of timber very close to tho finished size.   It is understood that this work tonld all bo carried Out by your Board and we will arrango for tbe necessary inspection of timber parts required for this country, eo that no unsuitable parfca will be shipped.(3) It is agreed that your Aircraft Production Board will adopt a programme of types of aoro-onginos and aero-planos from which tho American Aerial &quot;l-ets will be constructed.     Such types as are now agreed -are as followsTraining Engines.Curtiss OX 5.80 H.P. le Rhone
-2-Servloe Engines .fa)   150 H.P* Mono Gnome.   (It is fully appreciated that this type was not one on the list which we originally recommended);.(lot)   This class would comprise an engine suitable for fighter reconnaissance arid bombing machines , and it is under-stood that you have not yet decided with regard to it.(*,c);   20C H.F. Hispano-Suiza.Aeroplanes.Preliminary training.......................L. .. - CurtissIntermediate training.......................... - Bristol ScoutArtillery&amp;Roconnaiseance........................ - Bristol FighterFighter Reconnaissance &amp; Bombing................ - D.H.9.Single Seater Fighter......................... - Spad.. 4)   It is agreed in principle that your United States pro-gramme will provide machines for the following services1.   Training machines for training pilots for all American air fleets .2.   Service machines for use with United States Expedittoi^-oryy Force , comprising reconnaissance and fighting machines .3,   An auxilliary American air fleet of long distance fighter reconnaissance and bombing types, for use anywhere.As regards 3, it is hoped that in four months it will be possible to recommend a further type of long distance bomber , now under preparation .(15)   In view of the shipping difficulties , it is understood that it will be impossible to transport complete aeroplanes from the United Sftatcs to Europe., and accordingly, your machines should come to Europe unassembled, and be assembled, covered and doped, preferably in France..(6)    The Air Board desire to place orders in America through your Board under which we will receive deliveries of 50C engjnes per month, commencing if possible., in January, 1918, and covering-a total supply of -3,000 engines...   The type of this engine should be whatever you select in your category  &amp;)., and I shall be glad to hear as early as possible of the decision you come to as regards this..(7)   When our Curtiss deliveries are completedin ::arch, 191&amp;, it may be necessary for us to obtain up to 300 training engines per month thereafter, and it is agreed that your Board will allow us this option.48)    I wish to confirm the urgent necessity for your B0ard making arrangements for machines guns for aircraft, as it will be impossible to give any assistance from British sources.i9);   It is understood that in addition to your constructional programme in the United States, you are arranging for a preliminary programme of aeroplanes and engines from French sources .   As we have already agreed, the carrying eut of this programme should not be allowed to interfere in any&quot;way with the very large contracts for motors which we have already placed in France , andwhicib are considerably overdue .    There  -
is little doubt that your programme in Prance will tend almost oertainly to a quicker execution of our British contracts, as you will be able to rapidly improve the position as regards raw material.   To avoid any possible conflict which might happen in connection with the Hispano-Suiza engines from the group in France manufacturing these engines, it is ^understood between us that the first duty of the group is to bring their deliveries to this country up to a rate of not less than 400 per month, and for this to be maintained before any deliveries are made to you.   I would point out to you that our contracts also cover engines for the French and Russian Governments and it would appear to me improbable that the group will be in a position to deliver any motors to you before our orders are completed in accordance with the promised rates of delivery. In connection with this, it io also agreed that you will do your utmost to help the French manufacturers to carry out therie present commitments.In addition to the abovej it is understood between us that after completion of these contracts, we will still require deliveries at the rate of 500 motors per month from French manufacturers, the types of which are not at present specified.(10).   I also wish to confirm the joint demand now made on the French Government for the construction of 1000 80 h.p. Le Rhone en-ines, these to be all delivered before 31st December, 1917, the first 500 to be delivered to Great Britain and the next 500 to America.I note fro;-; your letter of 28th July that your Air-craft Production Board anticipate no difficulty in supplying ua with complete parts of aeroplanes of the types in your programme, in particular, the timber parts and metal fittings. I hope to arrange for a special representative to go to America shortly with our requirements of this character. Your letter of the 28th July contains the following para-graphot- a 30*8*      In a cable received today, the Aircraft Pro-duction Board say that if tho United States is to furnish the largest possible quantities of materials^ raw, semi-finished, and finished, for the aircraft programme: of the Allies, it is of great importance that the Allies&apos; requirements should be co-ordinated and that the Government i of the Allied nations should prepare and forward at the earliest possible date th(: approximate necessary monthly requirements of all classes of materials, including wood, finished and semi-finished aircraft parts, forging, fittings, propellers and in general everything else required.9.      The Aircraft Production Board accept and adopt tho view expressed in r-y cables that the supply of materials raw, semi-finirshed and finiahed by the United States to the Allies 3hould bt. the first consideration in the United States Aircraft pro-duction programme.   Therefore, it remains only to organise thi?j supply of materials so that it may be made as effective as possible.&quot;With reference to the abovt, I have to confirm Mr. Churchill*s verbal concurrence.I trust the above correctly reflects our agreement, and your confirmation would be esteemed byYours sincerely, (Sd) W. 12IR. &apos;or R. C. Boiling.
