SECRET. .  . ? -    r-    -      ofDESPATCH No. 18.Subject : GENERAL KORNILOVS COUP D&apos;F,TAT.v . British Embassy, Petrograd.Sir, 15th September, 1917,1. Although it. is officially announced that the Kornilov &quot; venture&quot; has been &quot; liquidated,&quot; it is extremely difficult to ascertain the real preliminaries which led up to this disastrous episode.Two views are held : (a.) That Kornilov really intended to declare himself absolute dictator and hadlong prepared for doing so. (6.) That he was asked by Kerenski to make himself dictator, and after makingdefinite preparations to do so, was thrown over by Kerenski and then decidedto carry on independently.The former is the view of the Government, or rather the view which the Govern-ment has taken such pains to spread throughout Petrograd and the country. The latter-is what Kornilov has definitely stated to be the case and which is the view undoubtedly held by the higher ranks of the Army.It. is obvious that prodigious lying has been going on in some quarter, at present unknown, but which probably history will reveal. In attempting to arrive at any decision as to which side is doing the lying, if it is worth trying to do so, there are one or two points which are worth considering.2. Firstly, Kerenski&apos;s attitude towards Kornilov ever since the latter was appointed Commander-in-Chief, especially at the time of the Moscow Conference. Kerenski feared and hated Kornilov. This was no secret. It was even said that Kerenski forbade Kornilov to come to make his report to the Moscow Conference, and it was also reported that Kornilov was to be arrested in Moscow by Kerenski&apos;s order.Secondly, the characters of the two men. Kerenski, weak, vacillating, very ambitious, and continually struggling with his ideals, which he knows to be imprac-ticable but is too weak to definitely renounce.Kornilov, on the other hand, strong, fearless, admittedly straightforward and a true patriot, though no politician.Kornilov&apos;s attempt failed, and it was obvious to anyone that it was bound to fail,, because it had not the Army behind it.Looking back, it seems incredible that Kornilov should have attempted such a coup oVetat, unless his version of the affair was correct, and there seems no reason to doubt it, while there is every reason to doubt the Provisional Governments version, which was daily dished up for the Petrograd public while the crisis lasted, and which was undoubtedly inspired by the Sovyet.An officer occupying a very high position on the Staff here said to me on Wednesday, 5th September, that Kornilov, being a determined.and hasty man, might hastily undertake a venture without proper preparation, but that if General Lukomski,. . his Chief of Staff, a cautious and very methodical organizer, was associated with it, it must be based on some solid foundations. But on the other hand, if the plot had been long prepared, it would surely have become known to the British Military Mission at the Stavka, and therefore to the British Embassy in Petrograd.3. Whatever prospects of success the plot may have appeared to have when viewed from the Stavka, it was obvious to anyone in Petrograd that it was bound to fail, because, so long as the Sovyet wields the power in the Army through the various Committees, the support of the Army, that is to say of the numerical mass of the Army, can only be obtained through the Sovyet. If, however, the Government had thrown in its lot with Kornilov and denounced the Sovyet, the result might perhaps have been different, but even then it is doubtful whether the plot could have succeeded, as the Sovyet would probably have immediately thrown in its lot with the Bolsheviks and the extreme left parties.(B17/59S)   25   10/17   h&amp;s   5075wc
Had it, therefore, been known at Petrograd that a coup oVetat was to be attempted, every endeavour would have been made to bring influence to bear on Kornilov to dissuade him from an act which was obviously doomed to failure.Hence it seems extremely unlikely that the plot was one long prepared beforehand.This leads to the conclusion that the second view (i.e., that Kornilov received some proposal from Kerenski, whether with the Governments sanction or not is not clear, though from Kornilovs statement Savinkov knew of it), is the more probaHe.4. Yet if this is accepted there are some apparently inexplicable discrepancies between Kerenski&apos;s and Kornilovs statements. One explanation of the great divergency between these two statements has been suggested. It is that Mr. Lvov,* after being-told by Kornilov that he approved the third of the three alternatives offered to him, returned to Kerenski aud said that Kornilov wished to make himself sole dictator and have nothing to do with Kerenski or the Government.On hearing this Kerenski telephoned to Kornilov to ask him if he confirmed what Lvov had said, but he never asked Kornilov what he had actually said to Lvov. So when Kornilov confirmed it, Kerenski thought that Kornilov confirmed the verbal message which Lvov brought, whereas he confirmed his acceptance of the third alter-nativc proposal offered to him.What is incredible is that in continuing the same conversation, Kerenski apparently not only made no remonstrances but even consented to come to the Stavka on the following day.When the Allied Ambassadors and Ministers offered their services as mediators between Kornilov and the Government, the latter, after expressing their thanks, stated that they could not treat with Kornilov because he had called them German agents. What he actually stated in his Proclamation wras : &quot; I accuse some of the members of the Government of direct betrayal of their country and as evidence I quote the following :  When I attended a meeting of the Provisional Government in. the Winter Palace on the 16th August Minister Kerenski and Savinkov told me that I must not tell everything as there were individuals among the Ministers who were not reliable.&quot;One of the arguments used against Kornilov by the Government in their absolutely unjustifiable propaganda in the press during the crisis was that they had given in to him on all his demands for the introduction of disciplinary measures. If this was so it seems to be yet another proof that Kornilov would not have attempted a coup oVetat to make himself sole dictator.5. Whatever uncertainties and discrepancies there may be in the story of Kornilovs ill-fated attempt, there is absolutely no doubt as to its results. I \ The consequences both for Russia and for the Allies are fatal.They may be briefly summarised as follows : -(a.) The status of the Russian officers, which even Kerenski had recognized to be intolerable, has been made still worse than it was immediately after the Revolution ; officers have again become suspects, and from all quarters are coming in reports of murders of officers by their men, murders as brutal as any of those which marked the beginning of the Revolution.(b.) The powers of the various unit committees was to some extent beginning to be limited, but they will now regain their former evil influence.In a word it may be said that the introduction o f discipline into the army, which was so tardily undertaken, has now had a set back, from which it is not likely to recover during the war.In&quot; fact the.Russian Army may now be considered as incapable of affording anv further assistance to the Allies, and it is unlikely that it will remain in the field even for many months more.Political.6. Although this report is a military one, and so should not deal will the political side of the question, the position of the Sovyet so affects the military situation that mention must be made of the effects of Kornilov&apos;s failure on this body. The Govern-ment has been in the hands of the Sovyet for some time, and has now been thrown even* M. Lvov, the ex-Procurator of the Holy Synod, submitted to Kornilov, the three following- alternatives -as coming from Kerenski: (a.) The exclusion of KerensK from the Government. (6.) The inclusion of Kerenski in the Government.(c.) The acceptance by Kornilov of a dictatorship which would be declared by the Provisional Government.
more into their hands. As the Sovyet is against the introduction of all the military-disciplinary reforms : demanded by Kornilov, it may now be assumed that no measures will be taken by the Government to increase the efficiency of the army. The outlook is extremely bad, as the Sovyet is, in its turn, drifting more and more into the direction of the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks, supported by German money, are organizing as \ they have never organized before. An outbreak at no very distant date is almost a certainty, and the triumph of the Bolsheviks will be the first step towards a separate 1 peace.Meanwhile, the two most urgent questions of the day, namely, the provision of supplies both for the army and population and their transport have faded into the back-ground, and the situation can only be described as critical to the last degree. Reports coming in&apos;from the armies state that there will shortly be a famine unless something is done. And nothing is being done. It is very doubtful whether the Russian soldier, even if well fed, will stay in the trenches when the cold weather sets in. He most certainly won t if he is hungry.This chaotic state of affairs appears to have no end. The Russians cannot organize. No Russian trusts his neighbour and with some cause as there are few who are not corrupt. None of the parties have any idea of yielding to others or coming to a compromise, because there is no patriotism in tne country nor have they the slightest feelings for their Allies.Under such circumstances it seems hopeless to expect that any party will be able to acquire sufficient power to extricate the country from the chaotic state into which it has drifted.I have, &amp;c.JAMES M.
