-Victoria 8240.5../ASTelegrams:-Growmoee, Sowest, Londox.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES...To avoid-delay3 address all communications to : FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,The Director General.72, Victoria Street,V&quot; &apos;\ London, S.W. (1)3rd October, 1917.Sir, ^r\beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended the 2nd October:-LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees.   The following matters have been reported upon during the week:-The Berkshire Committee have-directed Immediate steps to be taken for the extermination of rabbits upon Mr. Cole&apos;s estate of West Woodhay, a3 recommended in a report prepared by a representative of this Department, in spite of Mr. Cole&apos;s protests that the use of the land as a rabbit farm was sufficient for the purpose of food production.     The Committee are also directing the cultivation of the 100 acres recommended to be broken up.The Birmingham Executive Committee, as a result of proceedings recently taken against the Austin Motor Company (which failed upon a technical ground), have now induced the Company to place the whole of their agricultural land in charge of a practical agriculturist who is willing to,be guided by the advice of the Committee in its management.The Nottinghamshire Committee have been authorised to take possession of two adjoining farms at Gotham, of 98 and 40 acres respectively, which are in a neglected condition, and propose letting them to a single tenant.The Sussex (East) Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 140 acres at Backsett occupied by the owner and greatly neglected;   as well as of 60 acres at Rottingdean owned by a Land Company which before falling into the Company!s hands, was admirably farmed as a sheep farm.     There is now no
stock on this land, whilst the buildings are unused, and its cultivation will bring in 50 additional acres of corn land.The Worcestershire Committee have framed a scheme for improving the cultivation of the Kyre Estate, the farms on which have been greatly neglected.     The scheme has been approved and the Committee have been authorised to take possession of one farm of 340 acres, together with 66 acres of an adjoining farm, while the tenancy of a third farm is being determined.     It is stated that, as one result of this scheme, an additional 156 acres of corn land can be obtained by ploughing temporary pastures, although no effort in this direction was to be expected from the present tenants.Farm for training of women.   Approval has been given to a scheme of the North Riding Executive Committee to provide a farm for the training of women.     The Committee will take possession of the Moor House Farm (80 acres) and of an outlying 50 acres of Warren House Farm;   the whole will make a compact holding within sasy reach of Northallerton.     The Fomen!s Committee will provide the labour and the Executive Committee will supervise the management, the Board providing the necessary capital..Breaches of the Defence of the Realm Regulations. In two cases different Courts of Petty Sessions have imposed heavy penalties for non-compliance with orders to plough in or eat off crops of mustard, which have been grown without licences from the Executive Committees concerned.     Mr. Young of Keisby in Kesteven and Mr. Neal of Gunthorpe in Lindsey were each fined  100 for this offence.In Cornwall the prosecution of Major John Williams $ a large land-owner in the Helston district, for non-compliance with an order to cultivate 12 acres of land for the 1918 harvest, has resulted in conviction.     Eight acres of the 12 acres had been cultivated and the Bench considering that there had been &quot;careless-ness, but not culpable carelessness&quot; fined the defendant  5.   The case was not one which called for a heavy fine, and the Committee and the county generally are stated to be satisfied with the result.-2-
In Somerset the holder of an allotment of li acre at Milverton was fined  10 including costs, for non-compliance with a notice to cultivate it.Drainage. In Lancashire the Committee have convened meetings of persons interested in the lands affected by various schemes mentioned in previous Reports.   Some of these meetings have already been held with success;    and in several cases it is proposed to apply for the establishment of Drainage Boards so as to secure the permanent improvement of the areas concerned.     Other meetings in connection vdth        important tracts of land in South-East Lancashire have been arranged to take place immediately.The Lindsey Committee are calling upon the Brigg Court of Sewers to exercise their powers with regard to the Bottesford Beck.Damage by Game, Action under the Pheasants Order is r eported from Kent and Staffordshire, and under the Rabbits Order from Stafford-shire.Provision of Allotments.   Reports from 1,086 districts have now been received.     They show that in those districts 198,985 applications for plots have been made, and 180,066 plots, containing a total area of 13,263 acres, have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).The Report for 8th May last mentioned a plot of land situate in Denman Street, London Bridge, on which the Bermondsey Borough Council had entered and allotted to four applicants. It was then stated that the enthusiastic work already done justified the belief that, in spite of unfavourable conditions, affair crop of vegetables would be produced. An Inspector of the Department now reports that the scheme is quite successful.    Celery, kidneybeans, cabbage, greens and beef- RH look well, and possibly betterresults will be obtained next season.     Moreover, the site isgreatly improved from a sanitary point of view.Twelve acres of Bermondsey land are now being cultivatedby 166 plotholders, and it is stated that there are good crops of-3-
broad beans, dwarf beans, butter beans, peas, cauliflowers, tomatoes, onions, leeks,&apos; celery, turnips, kohlrabi, kale, beet and marrowsj   and a fair crop of potatoes, especially the early varieties.Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 13 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 611 acres, and 7 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 689 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Economy in the Use of Seeds.   A circular letter has been sent to the chief seedsmen in the country, requesting them to Incorporate in their catalogues, and distribute with their orders, leaflets pointing out the need for seed economy, which have been supplied by the Department.     Seedsmen have also been asked to put up &quot;Small packets of seeds for allotment holders, containing the seed required for sowing a given length of row for each of the crops commonly grown by allotment holders&quot;.     Many &quot;favourable replies have already been received to the letter.Potato Spraying.   A letter has been received from the Secretary to the Somerset Agricultural Executive Committee stating the opinion of the Committee &quot;that spraying should be made compulsory next year&quot;.     This Is a question of policy which will require serious consideration.Fruit Bottling and Drying,   Demonstrations continue to be in considerable demand, 66 having been provided in different parts of the country during the past week.Glass Jars for Fruit Preserving;.    The distribution of glass jars has been completed, the total number distributed being 1,626,972. Distribution of Sugar.   The 2,500 tons of sugar entrusted to the Department for distribution to fruit growers have now been all disposed of.Blackberries for Jam-making.   Up to Saturday, 29th   September, 100 tons of blackberries had been delivered to the War Office Jam Factories.
TECHNICAL DIVISION,Inspection of Broken-up Grass Land.    During the past few weeks a number of oat and other crops growing on newly ploughed grass land have.been inspected in the North of England.     The season for oats has been good on the whole and in many cases fine crops were grown;    the heaviest of these were badly laid, but north of the Humber only one discoloured crop was seen.     Generally the formers interviewed were well satisfied with the additions made to their arable area.     There were, hoy/ever, some exceptions. In one district of Northumberland three farms were visited on v/hich the crops were absolute failures, because of wireworra attacks.     The grass ploughed up had been of very good quality, and the farmers were naturally much discouraged.     The Entomologist of the Armstrong College was asked to visit these farms, and he and the Board&apos;s Entomologist are now endeavouring to devise means for checking the ravages of wireworm in this district.The crops of potatoes inspected on newly broken grass were uniformly good.     Even on land where oats had been seriously damaged by wireworm, potatoes appeared to be quite satisfactory,-, Plant Diseases.     Over fifty enquiries on insect- pests have been received during the week, 31 of them relating to diseases of the potato crop.     The Uisbech district has again been visited, to record the results of spraying experiments against apple mildew, to investigate two serious diseases of plum trees, and to examine the parsnip crop for pests which in other localities have caused serious damage.     Fortunately no evidence of the pests was discovered on the parsnips in -She Wisbech district.LABOUR DIVISION. Soldier Labour.     Returns received from Commissioners show that 1,500 men (950 skilled and 550 unskilled) were sent out to farmers during last week, making a total of 21,102 men, (7,000
skilled and 14,102 unskilled) supplied for the 1918 Programme, now out on the land.     The returns for the week are, however, very incomplete owing possibly to postal delays.The number of men supplied for training as tractor drivers and ploughmen during the week was 205, making 709 men allocated for tills purpose to date.     Of these men, 636 have been placed for training under Tractor Representatives, and 73 have been sent to the Department1s Training Schools.     In addition, 90 men have been sent out for work with steam tackle. Threshing.     Representations have been made to the Department as to the shortage of men for the purpose of manning threshing tackle, and 31 skilled men, who have been found among the soldiers arriving at the Distribution Centres, have been sent out to owners of such tackle.     In addition, the Military Authorities have been asked to make available among the 1918 Programme men 8 named soldiers who are skilled engine drivers, and, as regards 23 other named soldiers, to grant them a month&apos;s agricultural furlough for threshing work.     It is expected that the Army Forage Committee will be able to release a number of skilled drivers in the course of a few weeks, and this will relieve the shortage that exists at present.Release of Police for Agricultural Work.   The whole of the 150 men lent to the Department from the Metropolitan Police Force are at work on the land, and excellent reports are being received of the work they are doing.     The Police Commissioner has been asked v/hether any more men could be made available.A letter has been sent to the   Councils of the County Boroughs in England and Wales, asking Ffhether any members of the local Police Force who are skilled ploughmen could be lent to this Department for a time for agricultural work.
Horses.     Orders for the issue of 342 additional horses havebeen sent to Remount Depots during the week, making a totalof 2,095 horses to date.     The large majority of these horsesare out in charge of ploughmen under the Department^ schemefor assisting farmers to increase their area of arable land.Prisoners of War.     A request has been sent to the War Officethat 50 prisoners may be added to one of the existing camps.The total number of prisoners now employed on agriculturalwork is 4,654, including 1,215 interned aliens released forfarm work.     Schemes are now with the War Office for theemployment in agriculture of a further 775 prisoners.Women&apos;s Branch.The number of Land Army Women accounted for this weeis 6,448.     The returns show an increase of 157 whole timewomen actually employed on farms.     The details are asfollows:-In Instruction Centres 851In Training Bursaries 416On Farm Work 4,934 V/aiting to be placed inTraining Centres  ; 78 V/aiting for employment in depots 54Waiting in their own homes 1156,448The demand for women labour is at present greater than the supply, owing probably to the large numbers of women required for special seasonal work such as potato lifting.Eight threshing gangs have already been started in one district alone and six more are expected to begin this week.     It seems probable that all trained women who are now placed will be kept on throughout the winter.Gangs for potato lifting and threshing are being organised by Group Leaders, who are doing most useful work in this connection,.     In one case where there was absolutely no local labour to meet the demand for 40 women, a Group Leader has secured the necessary labour from a town some miles off, and is at present arranging transport and organising a creche,-7-
iviEC RADICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.Motor Tractors. The following statement shows the position respect ing the receipt of tractors:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committeesas shown in last Report ..................... 1,380Consigned during the week............................^_40.    1,420On offer to Committees     ......................,.......       39Consigned to Scotland (92) and Ireland (14)  ...........     10GAdvice received but not yet landed....................     1041,669The returns received as to the work of the tractors shop/a steady improvement each week.     The latest returns which havebeen analysed are for the week ended 14th September, in which period825 tractors wsro in the hands of Executive Committees in Englandand Wales^ sfl urtilofr H number were idle throughout the week awaitingrepairs, spare parts, etc.     Nevertheless, the average acreageworked for the whole of the 825 tractors was as followsPloughed........... 8.5Cross-ploughed.....    . 36Cultivated......... 2.1iFrom time to time statements are received showing the large amount of work that an efficient tractor can accomplish when handled by capable men.     An example of this was received by this morning&apos;s post.     For the week ending 28th September one of the tractors consigned to the West Sussex Committee ploughed, with a 3 furrow plough, 36 acres of ground in six days.I have sent communications during the week to all . Executive Committees inviting them to co-operate with the Department by selecting -local men to act as Tractor Supervisors, by devoting more care to the selection of land suitable for tractor ploughing. . and by bringing to my knowledge any difficulties they may be
experiencing irr-the- wooing-&quot;of1 viJ^:^PfljOtor---Scheme in their locality,.SUPPLIES.Supplies Sub-Committees-.-   The. Director of Supplies visited Lancashire at the invitation of the Lancashire Supplies Sub-Committee and addressed a meeting, of merchants with a view to removing difficulties which had arisen on the appointment of Approved Agents,     As a result of the explanations then given, the merchants agreed to undertake the storage of from 500 to 750 tons 9f sulphate of ammonia, and expressed their willingness to accept various proposals made by the Department in regard to tho distribution Of agricultural requisites.Sulphate of Ammonia. The response made by agriculturists to the appeal of the Department to place orders for sulphate of ammonia in the early part of the year has exceeded all expectations and it seems doubtful whether it will be possible to cupply all demandsu The Sulphate of Ammonia Distribution Committee has orders for a considerable quantity which it has not been possible to place, and makers have therefore been requested not to make any further salen (apart from purely local deliveries) except to the order of the Committee.     By this means the Department will be In a position to control sales more effectively than hitherto. Binder Twine, All the manufacturers of binder twine in thia country are now understood to be fully engaged to their maximum capacity, and it is sspected that home production will be not lese than 12,000 tons for the current season, while in addition arrangements have been made by the Ministry of Munitions for the importation of 8,000 tons, which is considered ample to meet all requirements.Lime.   The production of lime at the present time appears to be large and much in excess of the output in the same month last year, the production of burnt and ground lime in August amounting to over 13.500 tons as against 8,500 tons last year.
Condemned Food Stuffs.     The arrangements made by the Department to deal with food stuffs at the London Docks which are unfit for human consumption are working quite satisfactorily.     Up to the present over 52 tons, made up of a number of small consignments, have been utilised for conversion into cattle and poultry food. Seed Wheat.     The enquiries relating to seed wheat of the 1917 crop continue to come in freely, and as threshing Is proceeding on most of the farms where wheat was purchased supplies are available for immediate delivery.Seeds (other than Cereals).     A circular letter has been issued to merchants who are importing seeds from the United States of America indicating the methods which they should follow in order to secure facilities for transport across the American continent and fcr ocean tonnage.Seed Potatoes.   At a representative conference on the 27th ult. a draft Order for the control of seed potatoes was discussed and approved.The quantities of immune varieties secured up to dateby the Purchasing Committee are as followsTonsKing George V.797Great Scot1,107*Lochar30Templar1602,094*I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.
