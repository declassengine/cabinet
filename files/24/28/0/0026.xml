This instruction has apparently not been carried out for between 7th July and 13th September only about 60,000 tons of Rock had been loaded;    and as things are going at present it does not seem possible to count on the import of mere than say 25,000 tons of rock per month0The Agricultural Departments for England, Scotland and Ireland are in no way responsible for the present position, as, in accordance with a further decision of the War Cabinet, (see W.C. 162 M.2) arrangements for freight and manufacture respectively were left in the hands of- the Shipping Controller and the Ministry of JiA.n ) iions.The demand for phosphatic fertilisers is becoming acute, and, -nless the monthly import of 50,000 tons per month sanctioned by the Cabinet is kept up, the food production programme in the Unj .od Kingdom will be gravely embarrassed.(Signed)   R, B.
