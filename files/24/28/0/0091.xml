n o o ^wilt&amp; O JL ^f This Document is the Property of......His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)EFFECT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN GERMANY. .1.moment a exist eric Hcllweg, o;.i the 1 Party wh recent a Chancell and Gene in the rThere can he no doubt that there is at the present serious political crisis in Germany.     As proofs of the e of this crisis may be cited the fall of von Bethmann-the so-called &quot;Peace Resolution&quot; passed by the Reichstag 9th July, the formation of the Fatherland (or National) ich has been created to combat the Peace Resolution, and the ttacks on Helfferich (the Vice-Chancellor), Michaelis (the or), Admiral von Capelle (Secretary of State for the Navy) ral von Stein (Minister for War), which are likely to result esignation of the three former officials.2.     The following extracts from moderate papers show how bitter the feeling is at present:-    The &quot;Vossisohe Zeitung&quot; describes Admiral von Capelle&apos;s attack on the Independent Socialists as &quot;a deplorable, illegitimate trick on the part of the &quot;Government.     MichaeliB, as head of the Government, is responsible &quot;for the unhappy affair, which follows the unfortunate Helfferioh &quot;incident&quot;.The &quot;Vorwarts&quot;, in an article entitled &quot;Michaelis &quot;before the end&quot;,says &quot;The assertions of von Capelle have in an &quot;unspeakable manner converted the Reichstag into a theatre of the &quot;wildest scandal&quot;.The &quot;Kolnisohe Vclkszeitung&quot;   says &quot;Crisis is undoubtedly &quot;again in the air, a vote of want of confidence against the &quot;Chancellor being spoken of, and his fall, as well as that of the &quot;Vice-Chancellor, hinted at ........     We must get the better of this&quot;critical unrest, v/hich is in such crying contrast to our brilliant &quot;military position&quot;.     The &quot;Kolnische Zeitung&quot; says &quot;The National &quot;Party is working against the Government.     Unity is the need of &quot;the hour.3-,     The causes of the crisis may be summed up in the one word disillusionment.     The German people feel that they have been misled by the predictions of the result of the U-boat campaign, by the forecasts of the harvest, by the promises of large oAuantities of grain and oil from Roumania, by the assertions that America would remain neutral, and above all by the prophecy of a brilliant strategical success after the retreat from the Somme, of the impossibility of a serious British offensive on account of the diminution of our munition supply through the action of the submarines, and more recently of the early collapse of the British offensive in Flanders.All these promises and predictions were either made by the Government or were published in the officially inspired Press, and all have been proved false.     The result is a widespread feeling of deep distrust v/hich shov-s itself in political ferment.4.     The following statements by a German of considerable standing who was a witness of the crisis that resulted in the fall of von Bethmann-Hollweg, are noteworthy :-&quot;Consternation and chaos reigned in the Government &quot;Departments in Berlin.     It was/fully expected that bureaucracyiad seen its lastdayA panic ensued and the fate of&quot;the
e) U UI&quot;the German Empire was looked upon at that moment as almost &quot;sealed.     Had a German Kerensky arisen, the Reichstag and tfert Ctom &quot;whole nation would have been behind him, perhaps for all time. &quot;Anything might happen in Germany now.     The people have the &quot;pover in their hands and intend to use it.     Something has &quot;gone wrong in Germany.    Another year of rationing, further &quot;disappointments in the U-boats, more heavy casualty lists, and &quot;the breaking strain will be reaohed&quot;,5,     It is true that the July crisis was tided over by the intervention of von Hindenburg and Ludendorff, but the repeated heavy blows which the British Armies have dealt in the Western Theatre, combined with the unscrupulous efforts of the Pan-Germans to identify the Higher Command with their opposition to the Reichsta^Majority, have undoubtedly begun to sap the confidence, of the German people in their military lea+djrs.     Further crises are imminent and, apart from the pressure which the Entente can exert by maintaining a united front as regards war-aims and by repeating calmly and dispassionately through the medium of our I   leading statesmen the reasons for our refusal.to treat with the present leaders of Germany, we can by maintaining at full strength our military pressure on the German Armies in the Western Theatre hasten the crises and accentuate internal dissensions.     On the other hand, if this pressure is relaxed or transferred against one or other of Germany^ Allies, the Higher Command may be enabled to restore confidence in the invincibility of the German Armiea,to unite the warring factions and to reconcile the German people as a whole to the necessity of another year of war, supported by the conviction that by holding out they can win the peaoe that has been promised them.They may even be enabled to win this winter an easy, spectacular victory similar to those of the Serbian and Roumanian campaigns in the winters of 191F and 1916, by allowing them to withdraw troops from the Western Theatre and to concentrate then by means of their superior railway communications against one of our weaker allies before we could take the necessary steps to prevent a disaster.6.     But if our military pressure at full strength is maintained, the feelings of apprehension will increase, the infallibility of von Hindenburg and Ludendorff will be further questioned, and pacifist tendencies will be strengthened.The German Government will then be faced with one of two alternatives.     They may attempt a coup dretat and dissolve the Reichstag, or they may throw over the Pan-Germans and endeavour to conciliate the Reichstag Majority.     If the coup d&apos;etat is &apos; attempted, the resulting unrest will undermine the war spirit more quickly than we can dare to hope for at present, while, if a Moderate policy is adopted, we can depend upon tne Pan-German   to use their control.of the heavy industries and agrarian interests to force a oonflict with the rest of the nation,IIn either case, therefore, a struggle between the bulk of the nation and a powerful and aggressive minority would be inevitable, and although it is not suggested, in spite of the recent revelations concerning the German Uavy, that the majority would attempt a revolution, it is conceivable that, if the minority could not be brought to reason, the weapon of the general strike mightbe
be used.7.    To sum up, although it may be argued that the German armies cannot be decisively beaten in the field, the German nation is very vulnerable politically.     The best weapon to take advantage of this weakness is military pressure for it will more than anything else accentuate the internal dissensions and contribute more rapidly than any other measure to the undermining and final breaking of the German war spirit which is our foremost war-aim.General Staff, War Office, 13,10,17.^k  ^ ^^^^Secretary War Cabinet,Please circulate to \/ar Cabinet.W.R.
