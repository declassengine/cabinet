VISIT OF SCOTTISH AGRICULTURAL PARTY TO DEVASTATED AREAS IN MICE,^^morandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I think it would be of advantage to arrange that a carefully selected party of farmers and agricultural labourers from Scotland, including, say, two women, should be,sent to France to inspect those agricultural areas on the Bomme which have been devastated by the retiring German Army.I -make this suggestion - for&apos; the following reasons:-r/     (a);, There is., a tendency amongst fanners to think that&apos; &apos;   -&apos;,i-V,  iv* .they are bei^g. asked to make &apos;iMdue sacrifices for the Nation. They are-disposed to think &quot;that the alterations in their systems b,f farming which have been required in the present food crisis are unnecessarily irksome.   They, do not however realise that they, have been more fortunate than the agricul--tural population of any belliger-ent country outside of our own Dominions.(b) Farmers have, as a rule, little conception of the ruin that has overtaken hundreds of square miles of agricul-- tural France.(c) They have not had an opportunity of realising the hardships which beset our Troops in France.The selected farmers, and, so far as possible, the agricultural labourers too, would be men who could lecture, and who would undertake to lecture, during the &quot;Winterunder arrangements to be made by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, to audiences of farmers and farm labourers. Similarly, the women selected would undertake tr. lecture to Women&apos;s Institutes and other meetings of country women. Photographs and lantern, slides of the ruined farms and houses would be useful for lecturing purposes.It/;
It&apos;Would be aii advantage if some one who has fought in France and Who also has a knowledge of Agriculture , both in France and at home,could accompany the party. He. would be more capable of applying the lessons than a purely military guide&apos;.Aoout a week should suffice for the tour,    The party should consist of 4 men and 2 uonen.I trust that the War Cabinet will approve of this proposal. I ara satisfied Of the benefit which would result.(Signed)   HOBKRT MUMKQiScottish Office,11th October, 1917.-
