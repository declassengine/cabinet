Department of Information CFCFFT  - Intel1 ifence Bureau.^-- FSW/011Weekly Fe-rrrt on Snnin, XI (Oct. 4th,  1917. )In the five weeks that have elapsed since the last report on Spain was written,    nothing very definite has cccured to change the situation.    Senor Dato had by that time won, and has. since maintained, a victory over the ill-advisod and ill-fed forces of revolution, which were at onco broken whon they tried conclusions openly and physically with the whole power - civil and military - of the Government.    Great efforts v/ere made to corrupt the army, but they entirely failed. Everywhere, so far as the Censorship, which continues very strict, allows us to know the truth, the troops were loyal and the mass of the people were indifferent.     Except in Asturias where, as a strike at any rate, the movement continued for a fortnight or three weeks, all was soon over.     The Federal Republic which was to have been pro-claimed on August 19th was never so much as heard of, and some of the very men whose names were circulated as those of its provisional Cabinet openly denounced the whole movement.     This was the case with Senor Melquiades Alvarez and notably with Senor Cambo the Catalan leader who with his friends took very few hours to discover that the Revolution would be a fiasco and repudiated all sympathy with it. In Barcelona there wa3 some firing:   and English letters from there say that 68 lives were lost.    But they edd that the oity is uninjured and that the commercial world took so little notice ef the whole affair that the rate of exchange on BonScn remained unchanged.Meanwhile the Government is faced with the usual difficulty of Governments which have repressed revolutions.     There is- the danger by too great clemency of making people think that rebellion is a crime that orn be committed with impunity;    :.nd there is the other
danger of adding to the popularity cf the leaders by making them martyrs.     On the who&amp;e Senor Dato seems to be steEring a middle course between the two.      Hundreds probably even thousands of arrests were made during the days of trouble I   but it ssems that most of them were soon released.     Two or three, however, of the arrests which have been maintained raise the usual complication of political prosecutions. The organisers of the movement in Madrid were known and arrested at the very beginning.     They included Bestierc, a professor and member of the Municipality of Madrid:   a man said to be of the highest character and purest motives but an unpractical fanafcic.     Ee and others have just been sentenced to imprisonment for life.     A still more embarassing case fcr the Government is that of Domingo a man of similar character who is Deputy for Tortosa.     He hapnens to be particularly disliked by the military authorities, as he took an active part in exposing the dishonesties committed by the officers in the Korarcca Campaign; and during the military crisis in the summer he issued revolutionary aooeals to the rank and file.     The President of the Chamber at once protested against his arrest;   but Senor Dato declared that it is   in accordance with the Constitution, and the Civil Courts have refused to interfere with his trial by Court Martial which has not yet begun. Their decision is said to be in direct contradiction to the Constitution which,in fact, appears to provide for trial of Senators and Deputies by the Supreme Court;   and it is regarded as one of the many signs of the present domination of the army.An army which delivers a Government from rebellion easily estab-iishes itself in the position&apos;jf a Protector whose demands cannot be re-fused.     Even before the Spanish army rendered this invaluable service it had shown its -cower by the little &apos;pronunciamiento1 which caused the fall of the Alhucema^Cabinet in the summer.   The result of the success-ful rebellion of June followed by the useful loyalty of August is seen
in a number of concessions to the demands of the army involving consid-erable expenditure.     So far as they really increase the military strength of the country, they will cause little   complaint.     But there is always a suspicion that their principal result will be to swell the already disproportionate number and cost of the corps of Officers which is ridiculously large for so small an army.     It is said that in 1913 it had more Colonels than the German army.For the moment, however, for good or for evil there is no doubt-that its power is very great.     Will this have   any effect on the political situation and if so what?    All authorities agree, end indeed it is obvious, that Senor Dato&quot;position has been considerably strength-ened by his success!1^&apos; handling of the abortive Revolution.     Even the Csrlist and pro-German papers praised and congratulated him.     But in spite of this his position remains difficult and his future uncertain. His dependence on the army is   in itself a political weakness, he has no majority in Parliament, and it is not certain that the King will grant him a Dissolution nor that if he did either the army or the country would tamely accept a machine-made Election of the old sort providing him with the usual nominated majority.     The British ambassador reports rumours that the leaders of the Military Committees who defied the Government in June may press uoon the King the formation of a so-called National Cabinet under Senor ISanna,    It is at any rate generally admitted that the Committees which publicly declared in June for some kind of national regeneration involving the abandonment of the existing Rotativist system are impati&amp;nt at the absence of any sign on the part of the Government in that direction.     At that time one of the most remarkable features of the situation was that etien Liberal organs which would have naturally pretested against military defiance of the civil Government actually welcomed the Barcelona Tpronuaciaroiento&apos; as, what one Republican journal called it,   &apos;a despairing protest against the
oligarchy and nepotism&apos; of the existing system.     So now, it is asserted by Fabra Ribas, an able Socialist writer not now in Spain, thatm while there is a military dictatorship, it is that of a few pro-German Generals of the High Command and is not only disapproved by all the responsible political leaders but also by the Committee of the officers who desire constitutional reform and not the suppression of the Consti-tution.     It is said that they have lately let the Government know they have no desire for the continuance of the present state of siege and suspension of the guarantees, and that this is the meaning of the curious communique&apos; issued by the Government last week t* the effect that &quot;the Captain General of Catalonia reports to the Premier that the Catalan Infantry Committee are acting solely within the limits assigned to them in the conviction that the duty of the Committees is by no means that of interference in matters solely within the province of other State bodies&apos;.     &quot;hat the exact truth as to this may be is doubtful:   but it is at any rate certain.that, while the army has as a whole no political programme, it is like all other sections of Spanish public opinion from the Carlists and Maurists to the Republicans and Socialists, extremely impatient with the existing system.     Will it use its present power to insist upon an attempt at something better?Well-informed Spaniards who lifee abroad but in close touch with their country, are inclined to think that it can and very likely will;   or at least that the King, whom both army and politicians would in their opinion certainly obey if he spoke the decisive word, will himself feel that the whole state of public opinion makes a change necessary.    They believe that he may summon Senor Maura, as to whom they are charitable enough to hope that during his years of ostracism he may have learnt both wis-dom and repentance and may be at least partially sincere in his present denunciations of the system which when in power he practised as com-placently as any one else.     And they imagine Maura charged with the
formation of a National Cabinet including the other living ex-Premiers, pato, Romanones and Alhucemas, with such other statesmen as Cierva and Sanches Toca, and, if possible, Cambo, the head of the Catalan Regionalists, and one or more of the Reformists.     Suchja Cabinet it is suggested might hold free elections and would govern all the better for having, a3 it then would have, a real onioosition, especially oi the Socialists, to face in Parliament.     A coalition or National Government on some such lines is not merely discussed in conversation; it has been publicly demanded in the Spanish press as for instance by Pimentel of the Pro-Ally Nrticias as well as by the Pro-German A.B.C., which appears full of reforming zeal in the vigour of its denun-ciations of the nresent Oligarchical groups&apos; and &apos;sham elections .So far as can be judged, however, Senor Date, who talks of a dissolution of the ordinary sort and has made a public, but very vague, statement of an ambitious programme of reform, has no future of this sort in his mind.     And Sir Arthur Hardinge in discussing the rumours of a National Cabinet dismisses the scheme as in his Opinion impracticable.     He does not believe that Maura and the Reformists could possibly v/ork together and points out that National Govern-ments can, generally speaking, only come into existence in the presence of   some urgent danger obvious to the whole nation.     In his viev; the political indifference and inexperience of the country, coupled with the long habit of corruption, are such that a really free General Election, in which everyone was persuaded to go to the poll, might lead to worse confusion than the present system and even t* bloodshed.Yet the Ambassador, in spite of all the difficulties, agrees that the Rotativist parties on which the present system depends, seem to be brea king up, and fully admits the need of some serious reform. He thinks that the trouble is largely due to the unfortunate adop-tion in Spain of the French centralising prefectoral system which
subjects provincial politics to the control of the Central Government, that is to say of the party in power;    end he believes that so$f-gtrt of decentralisation with appointment by the King himself of pro-vincial officials for a fixed term of years is the most hopeful path cf reform.     As to the reform ef the Constitution he suggests that it might be dealt with by a Royal Commission appointed by the King from all parties.This is, after all, not very far from the proposal of a National Government, with a policy of moderate Regionalism.     Both admit the urgency of the problem, both prooose to solve it by a com-bination of men of all parties and by a polioy of decentralisation: and both lay the burden of initiative upon the King.     This last is s point which comes out strikingly in almost all conversation with those who know Spain.   If a new end improved situation is to be brought about it must be by the action of the King, to whose authority boldly exercised both political jealousies and military ambitions would, it is asserted, alike give way - It is a grave responsibility to rest on a single pair of not very experienced shoulders.Meanwhile, from a purely British point of view,. we have no reason to desire the disappearance of Senor Bato in favour of a National Government, especially one with Maura at its head.     I&apos;o Spanish Ministry is at all likely to depart from official neutrality:   but there are ways of interpreting neutrality and we naturally prefer that of Bato and Lema to that likely to be followed by Maura or that actually followed by Alhucemas.     The present Cabinet may not have done everything we desired but it has exasperated the Germans by its submarine regulations, it has resumed the Cortina negotiations which Romanones accepted and Alhuceraas broke off and it has lately been more amenable to our suggestions about the use of tonnage.     On the whole too it has resisted the strong temptation to be disagreable
forded by the foolish conduct of seme Allies, especially French, ?ent3 and journalists in assisting or glorifying or at least pub-icly associating with those concerned in the late attempted evolution;    conduct which, sedulously advertised and exaggerated by he pro-German press induced a large number of Spaniards and even, .t is reported on good authority, the King, to believe that the iusturbances had been prompted by French money,     Still, however much &apos;e $ight regret the fall of the present Ministry, it is to be remem-iGred that if a national Ministry were formed it would include :omanones, Dato and probably Sanches Toca, if not Lema, who would :e able to hold any serious pro-German tendencies in oheck:    especially ;S they would be fortified by such practical arguments as those just employed by the Malaga Fruit Exporters in a letter to the Prime (inister asking for negotiations with England as to removing restrio-tiens on their exports and suggesting that such negotiations might proceed more favourably if an end were put to &apos;certain aggressive journalistic campaigns entirely devoid Of honourable motives and based upon falsehoods1.J.
