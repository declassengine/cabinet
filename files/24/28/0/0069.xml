Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Report for week ended 10th October, 1917.i -jniaVii ii -iCommittee on Re-organisation.The President proposes to appoint a Departmental Committee to consider questions of the organisation of this Department and to report what steps should he taken to enable the BOard to deal most efficiently and economically with its work having regard to duties that have been imposed upon it by recent legislation ahd the conditions caused by the War,The terms of reference are not yet finally settled. The Committee will consist of the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries of the Board, and will include a representative of the Treasury who has already been nominated.     It is hoped that the first meeting of the Committee will be held next week.Hop Control Committee.The Board have now received Treasury approval of the Board1s scheme for controlling the hop industry in the situation caused by the reduction of brewing during the war. Under the scheme no dealing in hops will be possible except through the Control Committee, on which the brewers as well as all branches of the hop industry are represented.      The Committee will hold all stocks until brewing is resumed on a normal scale and surplus stocks are exhausted, and will fix prices which will enable the industry (i.e* growers, factors and merchants) to survive the period of the war.     The representatives of the several interests concerned are working harmoniously together on the Committee, and there is good reason to hope that the Committee1s operations will be successful financially.    The funds required to finance the scheme will be borrowed from certain Banks, under a Treasury guarantee which has already been given, at Bank rate of interest, varying, with a irinixnam of A%.    The prices fixed by the Committee will be such as will cover all expenses of management.*   Demobilisation.The Board have conferred during the week with the Ministry of Labour as to the priority of demobilisation which should be accorded to the several occupations engaged in agriculture and fisheries.    It has been arranged that the Beard shall proceed to take a census of the numbers of men of the different categories which individual farmers can take into employment (including men whose places are being kept op-m) immediately on demobilisation.    Agricultural workers will no doubt be among the first classes to be released from the Army when peace is declared, and the Board will keep in touch with the&apos; Ministry of Labour with a view to arriving at a scheme for demobilisation?, in tin? most de-si rable order of priority, the men rwrrnslly engaged in th* respective agricultural occtf ations.

Trawler Section indicate a small but welcome source of recruiting for the fisheries.Th5 recent instructions under which Government Departments are in future to communicate with the Ministry of National Service in connection with applications for exemption from Military Service in which they are interested, are receiving attention with a view to formulating the most convenient procedure for dealing with such applications as fall within the purview of this Department.The securing of adecuate labour for the 3ast Coast Herring fishing continues to engage attention.     The results so far are such as to indicate that avoidance of a shortage of labour will be exceedingly difficult.
