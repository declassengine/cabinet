A-111Copy No,  xf. ra.io.17,Air Raids and the Bombing of Germany.1.    Without in any way questioning the recent decision to detach two squadrons of aeroplanes from Sir Douglas flaig&apos; operations in Flanders for the purpose of bombing Germany, I wish to place before the War Cabinet my views on the air situation in general, the probable effect Of this decision, and on our future policy.2.    For some time past the British Armies alone have been seriously attacking Germany, and this has enabled the enemy to concentrate a large amount of air-craft on our fighting front.     He is estimated to have at the present time between the River Lys and the Sea 750 aeroplanes ready for action, as against our 850, including the French aeroplanes with their First Army now operating on our left flank, the Belgian aeroplanes, and our Naval aeroplanes. Our air-work is entirely offensive, and offence in the air - as on land -   requires superiority of force.3. One of the results of the enemyfs attacks upon London has been that our Press has presumed that because we are not bombing Germany our methods of air attackinvariably follow and do not precede those of the enemy. But the contrary is the case.    It was we who started bomN-ing with heavier-than-air machines;   the Germans followed us, they now bomb behind our lines very effectively, but stj. not to the same extent as we bomb them.   In September 6\xe aeroplanes carried out bombing raids on 23. days and 19 nightdropping
4 QJ. 4*dropping 203 tons of bombs, as against 4% tons of bombs dropped in and around London during tho same period.     It was we who started the direct co-cperation of air-rcraft with infantry by the use cf machine-gun fire from low flying aeroplanes in battle;    tho Germans have again followc us in this, but we have kept steadily ahead of them,4.     During tho battle of the Somme we obtained absolute mastery in tho air. and the effect of this en tho German Higher Command is shewn conclusively by General Sixt veri Arminfs well-known memorandum *n the lessons of tho Somme, and by the great efforts which Germany has been making to prevent the same result happening again.     During the present year we have had a hard struggle to keep nur initiative in the air, mainly because neither the Russians nor the French   have assisted us as we might have hoped, but wo have kept it.       Further, the fact that our Armies are constantly attacking makes it necessary that wo should do more photographic work than the enemy,    and carry out mere observaticn far our artillery, and in order that these essential services may be continued uninterruptedly we have tc keep on driving the enemy1s fighting machines from tho air.     All this means a great strain on our air resources, and though we have been enabled to give Sir Douglas Haig sufficient machines t^ maintain a certain superiority in the air, he has not yet by any means received what he has asked for and what he ought to have.      In June 1916 ho asked for oc squadrons tc be completed by the Spring of 1917.     He is still if; squadrons below that figure. In November 191G he asked for 20 more fighting squadrons and
verv10 more bombing squadrons.-    None of these he has yftt re-cMlted. The necessity for pressing forward the output of air-craft, so as to meet these requirements^ was several times brought to the notice of the War Cabinet some months ago, -? o*g, see Proceed-ings of 15th December, 5th March, 16th April, 8th May and 14th June-       As to the other theatres of war - Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Salonika are each one squadron, and Lord French two squadrons, short of present requirements.5.     I have already informed the War Cabinet that I do not think that the number of aeroplanes which has been sent south will suffice to ensure really continuous and effective bombing of German towns, and if this proves to be the case, and the enemy continues to raid England, the public will probably demand increased bombing of Germany.     If this demand is acceded to before the weather puts a stop to our operations in Flanders it may have a very serious effect upon the situation on the hattie front.6.     personally I do not think that bombing German towns will cause the enemy to cease bombing London, but on the contrary that we shall be subject to air raids throughout the war, and to uii increasing extent,       We are in the air war-zone, and the usual consequences may be expected to follow.   I know it is argued that the French have stopped the enemy from bombing Paris by retaliatory raids, but I do not believe this to be so.,     The enemy bombs London in preference to Paris because first it is easier, secondly we are the enemy he most wishes to strike, and thirdly from what he reads in our newspapers he probably regards bombing us as the most effective use of his aircraft.       The French   long distance retaliatory raids are not really
very damaging and are usually carried out by not more than one or two fast long-distance machines carrying a few light bombs.      In any case these French raids have not deterred the enemy from reducing a large part of the town of Dunkirk to ruins and terrorising the civil population to an extent which makes it probable that they will have to be removed from the town, nor has it prevented the frequent bombing of Calais, nor of moso of the large French towns in our occupation.      As I have just said, the bombing of German towns is not unlikely to increase the bombing of London, for the enemy has the advantage in that he is able to get at our Capital whereas we cannot get at his.    The German public is more accustomed to discipline and to war than ours is, and the population of the Pihine towns has not the facilities which the population of London possess of making its feelings known at Headquarters.     Neither Berlin nor the German General Headquarters are likely to be much influenced by appeals from Mannhein.     The one real advantage which we may get is that we may scare some of their munition workers away from their work, but it ia equally probable that a more effective means of lessening air-raids on England in the immediate future would be to increase Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s power of bombing the enemy!s aerodromes.     Experience in France has proved that this does reduce it although it does not wholly stop it. It would at the same time increase Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s power of offence.7.   As to the future we cannot assume that the enemy will confine his raids to moonlight nights.     As he gains experience he will probably attack us on every night when the weather conditions are favourable, irrespective of the state of the moon, and his aeroplanes will almost certainly grow in range and power.     We must therefore expect that he will attack other Important centres In England, for thedefence

C.I.G.S.defence *f which we shall require mere guns.     It will certainly be desirable to carry out an air offensive on Germany whenever this is possible during the Winter, for then we shall bo necessarily comparatively inactive on the ground and the number of machines which we can release for this purpose should be considerably greater than that we can send to Nancy at present,     Nevertheless, the best way of preventing raids upen England would seem to be to drive the enemy from the Belgian coast.     We shall then have a permanent barrier which he must pass in order to reach England, get earlier warnings *f his approach, and be better placed to attack him both on his outward and return journey.     We may then hope that raids upon England will prove so costly as to force him to abandon them.3,     The chief points to which I wish to draw the attention of the War Cabinet are :-(a) The importance of not further diminishing the air-craft at Sir D,Haig&apos;s disposal until the present operations are concluded,(b) The necessity for hastening the maximum output of aeroplanes compatible with the maintenance of other equally vital services.
