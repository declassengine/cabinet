October 1917.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 20.Week ended 1th October.NAVAL OPERATIONS.There, are no important movements of any of the enemy fleets to record, but German Baltic. Naval&apos;Forces have again been reported to be approaching the Gulf of Finland, but so far there has been no news of&apos;any action. Of seven Russian submarines ear-marked for the defence of the Gulf only two were ready on 25th September to take up their positions, while the British submarines were all ready for service with the exception of one which is refitting at Revel.On 30th September enemy aeroplanes successfully bombed a 12-in. Russian battery on the Island of Osel, exploding one of the magazines and causing a considerable amount of damage and many casualties.Near the entrance to the Bosphorus, Russian T.B.D.&apos;s have sunk two coal barges and Black Sea. a tug, and brought a third barge into Sevastopol writh 39 Turkish prisoners.   This slight activity on the part of the Russians is so far satisfactory.An extensive operation by a force of destroyers, submarines and trawlers, is being North Sea. carried out against German submarines in the North Sea.   The weather has been much against any large success.Additional deep mines have been laid off S.W. coast of England. BritishMinelaying.The cruiser &quot; Drake &quot; was torpedoed off Rathlin Island, 19 lives being lost, and she Casualties, subsequently sank hi shallow water.   She was 16 years old and of no great fighting value.The destroyer &quot; Brisk &quot; has been mined in Rathlin Sound and badly damaged, 31 lives being lost.Dover destroyers had an engagement with some enemy destroyers and drove them off. FlandersR.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aero- area^0^ dromes at St. Denis Westrem on 5 occasions (large fires being caused on 3 occasions) and on Thburout Aerodrome, Zeebrugge lock gates (4 occasions), Zeebrugge mole, the railway bridge over the Meuse at Namur (where 2 direct hits with 250 lb. bombs are claimed), Brugeoise Works, Bruges docks and Thourout railway junction, etc. The total weight of bombs dropped was about 19 tons.Enemy machines again raided the R.N.A.S. depot at Dunkirk and did considerable material damage, several sheds being destroj^ed and a large number of machines put out of action temporarily.R.N.A.S. patrols from Dunkirk have destroyed 3 enemy machines, driven down out of control 5 and driven doAvn 2.Two enemy machines, one of which wTas returning from a raid on London, made forced landings hi Holland.   One machine is alsoreported to have fallen in the sea off Dover.In the Mediterranean, 2 of 3 enemy seaplanes reconnoitring Mudros were shot down Mediter-into the sea by R.N.A.S. machines and the third was driven down damaged, a wounded ranean. enemy pilot being taken prisoner.A Handley-Page aeroplane which left Mudros to attack Haidar Pasha (near Scutari, Asia Minor) was shot down by the Turks.(0 681)   Wt.   .   50   10/17   H &amp; S
ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines The number of large enemy submarines believed to have been operating dimno operating,   the&apos;-week-is 22 to 27,most of which have been working m the^Atlantic.   beveral havebeen operating in the approach routes to the westward of the Bay of Biscay but havedone little damage except to sailing vessels, and no convoys have been attacked. Actions The encounters with enemy submarines durmg the week have resulted in the probabletkn enemy destruction of at least one. In addition, during the week a report has been received of the submarines. certain destruction of one &quot; U &quot; Boat in June not previously notified, but on the othe,hand the &quot;UB&quot; Boat, recently interned in Spam, has been allowed to escapeThe following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines m HomeWaters during recent weeks and the nature of the craft which have engaged them:-Nature of Craft.

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and losses by submarine and mine of British Merchant Steamships of over 500 tons grossegister.&apos; . &quot;      * - &quot;    - .        &apos;&quot;&apos; V &apos;  &apos;.&quot;    ,The tonnage of British vessels lost this week shows a slight increase on the three jrevious weeks.   Similarly the percentage of losses to sailings of British Steamships n overseas routes to and from the United Kingdom is also increased.The tonnage of Allied and Neutral Vessels lost this week is again the lowest on record chirms the period of unrestricted submarine warfare.The table in Appendix II is a comparative Statement of all British Merchant Vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the last two weeks by submarine and mine according to areas. It indicates that the losses this week are almost entirely confined to the South Atlantic and west of Gibraltar, where five ships which were proceeding independently of convoy were sunk.The table in Appendix III shows by trades as regards British Merchant Steamships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine or mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last two months.The following Table shows the number and gross tonnage of all Merchant Vessels lost by enemy action in each month since the commencement of the unrestricted submarine operations of the enemy : Losses ofBritishsteamships.Month.1917.British Merchant Vessels.No.TonnageBritish Fishing Vessels.No.Tonnage.Merchant Vessels of other Allies.No.Tonnage.Merchant Vessels of Neutrals.Areas in whichvessels lout.Losses in trades.Compara1-tive state-ment of monthly losses.Total.No.Tonnage.No.Tonnage.FebruaryMarchAprilMay...JuneJuly...AugustSeptember105 125 167 121 120 95 89 73313,414 355,446 541,083 352,672 412,113 348,977 322,531 184,07330,4341192118573,478 3,586 5,920 1,448 1,342 2,736 242 24560 62 82 70 76 70 60 4984,280 81,151 134,448 102,960 124,510 111,711 125,432 96,08469 92 122 96 89 56 34 17135,090 165.225 189,373 139,605 139,229 70,370 53,018 28,815264 322 412 306 306 239 188 146536,262 605,4.08 870,824 596,685 677,194 533,794 501,223 309,217It will be seen that, both as regards numbers and tonnage of vessels sunk, the month I&apos; September shows a considerable improvement on August, which itself was the record month since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare, the total tonnage &quot;ost in September being nearly 200,000 tons below the August figure, and considerably less ban in any month since September, 1916.The losses in British fishing vessels remain almost exactly at the same low figure as in August, Avhich appears to indicate that the scheme of Control and Protection of Fishing Vessels in operation is proving effective.The losses of Allied and Neutral vessels in September, if taken together, are also the lowest on record during the period of unrestricted submarine warfare.The total number of merchant vessels lost by enemy action since the outbreak of war is 4,518, their aggregate tonnage being 8,966,275. Of these, 2,254, with an aggregate tonnage of 5,387,996, were British vessels.The following Table shows the average daily tonnage of British Merchant Steamships over 500 tons Gross Register which has been sunk or damaged by enemy action or has escaped from attack for each month since the uniestricted Submarine Warfare commenced, standardized by taking 100 as the daily average for February in each case : Month.

It wll be seen that the tendency which was pointed out last month for the number of submarine attacks to become fewer but more deadly, has been emphasized in the month of September. Speaking in terms of tonnage the attacks in that month are only about two-thirds of the August figure and one-half of the February figure, while the escapes from attack undamaged in September are considerably less than two-thirds of the figure for August, and one-half of the figure for February. There is no reason to think that the number of submarines operating in September has been less than in any previous month, and the large reduction in the attacks demonstrates the value of the various measures which are being taken, and probably also indicates a desire on the part of the enemy to economise in the expenditure of torpedoes and some weakening of the morale of enemy crews.ENEMY MINES.Casualties.        The losses by mine in home waters this week are three merchant ships (two being fishing smacks), and a destroyer was badly damaged.The following table shows the number of Enemy Mines destroyed and British Vessels sunk by mine in recent weeks : Areas&apos; affected.Sunk mines.Week Ended.

An alternative channel to Newhaven, however, was opened.It is believed that all the groups of mines recently laid by submarines in the neigli-bourhood of the Minches have now been located.There have been several recent instances of fishing boats trawling up mines on the bottom. The cl.ass of mines laid by the enemy when sunk without exploding remain dangerous for a considerable time, and are a menace to the trawling industry which is continually warned of danger areas. As soon as vessels are available, these mines will be dealt with by means of a bottom sweep.Convoy.Defensive armament.Offensive armament.Dazzle painting.Mine pro-tectiongear.DEFENCE AGAINST SUBMARINE AND MINE.711 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 814 last week. Of the 711 ships convoyed, 317 were engaged in the French coal trade, 168 on the Scandinavia  Lerwick Hurnber route, the remaining 226 being engaged in overseas trade, 108 inward and 118 outward. Although no convoys have been attacked this week, one convoy vessel was torpedoed by a submarine- while under local escort and ran on the rocks near Brest. Two other merchant ships have been sunk, one by mine and one by submarine, after dispersal from their convoy.During the week 36 additional Merchant Vessels were fitted for defensive armament, bringing the net number now fitted up to 3,319. The number of guns now available amounts to 2,995.The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered to date is 108.Of the 150 ships which have been or are being &quot; dazzle &quot; painted, 63 had performed 337 voyages up to the end of September. During these voyages only three of these vessels have been molested, of which two were sunk and one escaped.During the week 44 additional merchant ships have been fitted with Otter equipment, bringing the total number so fitted to 527.
UNITED KINGDOM SHIPBUILDING.The following statement shows the number and gross tonnage of Merchant Steamships MeeggJ^ 0f 100 tons and upwards reported as completed during each month of this year :-       JtractionTJanuary February March April May June July August SeptemberNo. of Vessels. 13 24 22 21 16 20 24 21 13174Gross Tonnage. 46,929 78,436115,654 67,536 68,033108,397 81,188100,900 60,685727,758It will be seen that, both as regards number and tonnage, the returns for September are the lowest since the month of January.On the 5th July the Admiralty submitted proposals to the War Cabinet under which, provided they obtained certain steel and labour, a forecast of deliveries of new tonnage was given.The small output for September is due to a combination of causes. To achieve output according to the maximum forecast, it is necessary to complete a number of ships building on private account, which are in various stages of construction ; and it is taking considerably more time than was at first anticipated to complete arrangements for securing a progressively increasing output.Difficulties have also been experienced in the supply of steel, as already reported to the War Cabinet. The shortage of steel two or three months ago is reflected to some extent in the output of tonnage during last month, and its effect will probably continue to be felt for the next few months.There have also been labour troubles in various yards; and the holidays which, under the circumstances, it was hardly thought would be taken, were in some cases extended, and the workmen generally resumed work very tardily.As one quarter of a year has elapsed since the Admiralty proposals were submitted to Comparison the War Cabinet, it is opportune to review the situation.   The following table shows the of forecast forecast of loss, output, and net loss of British Merchant tonnage for the three months with actual ending 30th September submitted to the War Cabinet, compared with the actual loss, lossei? of output, and net loss : merchant tonnage.1917.

The position, however, is in fact better than appears from the above table, as there have been certain unforeseen accretions which were*not included in the original estimate.

None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.The sailing vessel &quot; Lutece &quot; (referred to in last week&apos;s Appreciation as the French trading schooner &quot; Luteogist &quot;), which was captured by the &quot; Seeadler&apos;s &quot;crew, is now manned by three German officers and 59 men, and carries machine guns, rifles and bombs. She has not been heard of since being reported off Suva, Fiji, on the 21st ultimo.The S.S. &quot; Wolf &quot; is also believed to be in the Southern Pacific, but nothing has been heard of her since she was reported to the S.E; of New Guinea on August 12th.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Portugal.A report from Lisbon states that there are now 6 trawlers which carry out patrol duties round the entrance to the Tagus and to the north and south of the river. Besides these there are 8 mine-sweeping trawlers which carry out a systematic sweep of the mouth of the Tagus, working in 48 hour watches.The 3 T.B.D.&apos;s and 2 small T.B.&apos;s are the only units of the Fleet which go to sea. The T.B.D.&apos;s, besides patrol work, which at times takes them as far as St. Vincent and Faro Island, furnish escort for the 2 Troop Transports &quot; Pedro Nunes &quot; and &quot; Gil Eames,&quot; either to Brest or Portuguese East Africa. .Spain.There have been no sinkings in territorial waters for some time, but whether this is due to Spanish vigilance or to German policy, or to our own convoy system, it is not possible to say.The Spaniards are sending a Torpedo Boat to Algeciras, but it is not known how the other small craft employed on patrol of this coast are distributed.It is probable that there were no munitions on board the &quot; U.B. 49 &quot; when she escaped from Cadiz on 6th October as they were all stored in the Arsenal on internment.Peru.The severing of diplomatic relations with Germany, should solve difficulties over coaling and the disposition of colliers, and considerably help our squadron in maintaining itself on the Pacific coast.Uruguay.The use of Montevideo and its facilities should relieve H.M.
