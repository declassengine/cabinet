His Britannic Majesty^ $overtime tr(This Document is the Property oSECRET.Intelligence Bureau. Department of Information. FIW/013,Weekly Report on Italy, XIII. (Oct. 5th, 1917.)Internal Conditions.The publication of the Socialist Circulars, referred to in our last Report on Italy, has acted as a tonic on the spirit of resistance throughout the country.      It revealed a deliberate intention on the part of the official Socialists to &apos;do all in their power to hinder the prosecution of the War&apos;.     &apos;The Circular lays down the principle that the Communes held by the Socialist party should be used as a means of stopping the war before the winter.     It suggests that at a given word all members of the party occupying posts in the..public service should resign, thus producing chaos in the Administration of the country, or alternatively that the Socialist Mayors and Corporation throughout the country should resign.    As these bodies are to be entrusted with the distribution of corn, the result would be a breakdown of the food-supply and riots&apos;    (Ambassadors Despatch of Sept.  3rd)The German Chancellor&apos;3 hopeful reference to &quot;revolution in Italy&apos; and to the growth cf agitation there for peace has helped to put all Italian patriots on their mettle and has stimulated them to increased efforts.     A special emphasis was given to the celebration of Sept. 20th, the anniversary of the acquisition of Rome as capital of   t&amp;eKingdom, which/opportunity for great demonsl^tions in all cities inthat &apos;new Committees are springing up everywhere for war-work and propaganda&apos;t and that great success is attending the lectures given by blind and permanently disabled officers in all great centres.The legal proceedings demanded and initiated against lazzari, Secretary of the Socialist Executive and author of the Circular, are hanging fire and the interventionist press is becoming impatient andavesupport of the war.The Time ^correspondent on Sept. 30th reports
suspicious.     The Circular was referred to the Royal Procurator far examination &quot;by the Minister of the Interior so long ago as Sept. 12th but no further steps have yet been taken.     The difficulty seems to be that, whi&amp;e the ?Defence of the Realm&apos; Decree *f May 23rd 1915 can hardly be interpreted to cover the case and, even if it could, only provides a maximum penalty of 500 lire, the inadequacy of which would make the proceedings ridiculous, a criminal process on a charge of high treason might lead to unpleasant revelations and by serving the ends of the Socialist, pacifist propaganda might do more harm than good.Meanwhile the Government seems to be in earnest with its new policy of firm resistance.     We have already reported the extension cf the war-gone to Genoa, Alexandria and Turin.     Military jurisdiction which had already been applied to the town and harbour of Messina and Reggio of Calabria has now been extended to the surrounding country districts:   and a report has reached the British Embassy from a good source that, recent attempts to instigate strikes and disturbances at Milan, have been checked by the prompt action of the Prefect who had sent for the Sooialist leader, Turat, and informed him that he had full powers, on the slightest sign of disorder, to deolare the inclusion of Milan in the war-zone.The Socialist party on its side does not seem inclined at present to risk an open trial of strength.     The Socia&amp;ist Union of Rome, at a meeting recently held, while affirsing its solidarity -&amp;n-the Lazzari, decided to desist for the present from action calculated to dislocate public life.The fi^ece light thrown upon Socialist subversive pacifism has had a moderating effect upon the Clerical pacifist movement, which is divided between its desire on the one hand to back up the Pope&apos;s effort to expedite peace, on the other to dissociate itself from revolutionary and anti-clerical Socialism.     The Vatican press
frankly confesses itself disappointed with the replies made by the Central Empires to the Pope&apos;s note, which abound in vague generalitiesj . .....and avoid all definition of war-aims.     But, by making the most of the willingness to treat expressed in them, their qualified acceptance of the principle of diarmament and the absence of any reservations in respect to the Pope&apos;s stipulations regarding Belgium and the rights of nationalities, the Corriere d&apos;Italia is able to convince itself that the replies do not exclude the possibility of negotiation and infers from the reception given to the replies in Germany that they may shortly be followed by more explicit declarations.     Meanwhile it is the duty of all Italians to maintain an unrelaxed resistance and to give the responsible Government opportunity to: develop its policy in the national interest - whether for war or peace.The menace of Socialism at home doubtless also accounts in part fot? the general hostility manifested with varying degrees of frankness by most sections of the press except the official Socialist towards the Russian Soviet and the sympathy shown with Kcrnilov&apos;s movement.     Even the Reform Socialist Pppola d&apos;Italia hopes that the Kornilov-Xerensky crisis will result in the smashing of the various Committees. Heere also the Clerioal press is in logical difficulties having to re-conciaie (1) its desire to see strong Government restored in Russia with its opposition to the Reactionary&apos; war-party at home, (2) its own pacifism with condemnation of the most prominent exponents of lacifism in Russia and at iEome.Pood Control.With regard to the re-organisation of the Pood Department -Commissariato dei Consumi - no settlement has yet been reached.     The propoa&amp;l to place Canepa&apos;a Department, which had hitherto been practi-cally independent, under the effective control of the Ministry of the Interior, was discussed by the Cabinet at its meetings of the end of
August and beginning of September (Report on Italy XI, S$Bt. 14th) and was generally believed to have been acoepted.     Now it appears that there are difficulties in the way and that nothing is settled. The truth seems to be that, in view of the irreconcileable hostility of the interventionist groups to Orlando, the placing of the Department under his control would be likely to compromise its efficient working.     Already one prominent and influential meober of the Commissariat , Pirolini, has sent in his resignation, declar-ing in a&apos;letter to the press that he could not possibly sexvefc under Orlando.     On Sept. 25th ae Agency published the statement that it was untrue that the Commissariat had been placed under the Ministry of the Interior, that it was still independent and that the whole question was to remain open until it had been discussed in Parliament. ihxThis statement was at once denied by Canepa.Meanwhile the simplification in the machinery o  food-supply is apparently being carried through.     The voluntary system of rationing through Local Committees has been abandoned and rationing of flour and cereal foods ordered throughout the Kingdom - the execution being entrusted to the Provincial Prefects working through the Municipal Governments.The seriousness of the questions of grain and coal supply in con-nexion with the morale of the Civilian population is emphasised by the Ambassador in successive despatches.The Spirit of the Army.In conversation with Sir Rennell lodd on Sept. 3rd, Signor Bissolati stated that the Papal peace-propaganda had done no hearm in the&apos;army whose spirit he described as &apos;magnificent1.     This is fully borne out by private information received from a correspondent in Italy who writes that 1 signs of disintegration are extraordinarily
few&apos; and makes it clear that the reports of mutinies at the front mve been absurdly exaggerated and adds &quot;If the present offensive can be turned to real account, the war-parties will be much streng-thened:   and I don1t believe the army, much as it longs for peace, will be content to be left in the lurch before its prime objec-tives are gained.     The greater publicity given in England to Italian deeds and aspirations came not a day too soon, and has done a great deal of good.&quot;
