^\     [ This Document is the Property of /f1 ^\.,   His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.).     &apos; COST OF TSE MINERS1 WAR WAGE.It is estimated that the cost of the war wage which it has been agreed to pay the miners i.e. 1/6 a day and 9cL to those under 16, will be approximately 22 million pounds per annum, and it must now be decided whether the whole or any part of this amount should be borne by the consumer or whether it should be borne by the State.The present annual output may be taken as 250 million tons divided as fellows;-Millions of Tons.Allies 25Neutrals 6Bunkers 12Admiralty 12Domestic 35Industrial 160-250An all round increase of 2/- per ton should be suffi-cient to meet the increased cost, but the rate now charged to Allies is in excess of that charged to consumers in this country and it may therefore be aesirable that no further increase should be made.    But as regards all other consumers there appears to be no reason why they should not bear the additional cost and it is recommended that the Goal Con-troller be authorised to increase the cost of coal (except to Allies) generally by 2/- a ton.A.EL STANLEY.5th October, 1917.
