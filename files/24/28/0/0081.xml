Joseph DaviesThe important work of maintaining the flow of traffic through the Docks and Harbours of the Kingdom has since November 1915 been entrusted to the Port and Transit Executive Committee.This   Central Committee of which Sir Norman Hill is Chairman, is represented at each *ort by a local Committee consisting of! Commercial Labour and Departmental representatives .To assist the Committee in their work , the Cabinet in January 1916, authorised the formation of transport Workers&apos; Battalions, consisting of men undergoing military training, but placed at the call of the Port and Transit Committee to assist, at Docks where civilian labour is insufficient to meet traffic-demands .These Battalions have gradually grown until they now comprise 11,000 men, and their usefulness can be gauged from the fact that they did 141,273 days&quot; work at various ^ocks in the month of May .   Their duties have now been extended to assisting on Railways, at Steel Works and on Canals.In addition to the   Port and Transit Executive Committee there are two other bodies dealing with ^ock and Harbour matters viz.,Co-ordination&apos; Committees (appointed by the Admiralty) at the Ports of Liverpool, Glasgow and Bristol.Port Labour  &apos;ommittees , appointed by the Board cf Trade, at each Fort, to deal with the granting end withdrawal of exemptions from military service..At the end of July at the request of the Executive Council of the National Transport Workers1 Federation, the Labour Representatives withdrew fro;?1 the Fort and Transit Executive Committee and from all the local Fort and Transit Committees . In a letter announcing this Mr. Harry Gosling, the President of the Federation, gave as their reasons:-1;        The lack of co-ordination of tho different Committees resulting in our resources as to Dock Work not being used to the best advantage .2.-        Dock Labour being depleted in defiance of best interests of the country .3.        Transport Workers1 Battalions being introduced where civilian labour was available.
Oj\ receipt of these resignations the Port and Transit Executive Committee wrote to the Prime Minister agreeing that under existing conditions there was considerable overlapping, and pointing out that grave difficulties would arise if the co-operation of the Labour Members of the Executive and Local Corelttees was withdrawn.On the instruction of the Prime Minister the several Departments and interests concerned have been approached and an agreement has been arrived at .    Under this the co-ordination Cor.u7i.ittees of Liverpool, Glasgow and Bristol will -be merged in tho Port and Transit Committees of those Ports, and complete co-ordination between the Port Labour Committees and the Port and Transit Committees will be secured .   r-4ie Lock Labour representatives will rejoin the Central and local Port and Transit Committees and the National Union of Rail-waymen will also co-operate .The agreement has been approved by the Admiralty, the Board of Trade , the Shipping Controller , the Port and Transit Executive Committee , 11? . Robert Williams , the General Secretary of the Transport Workers1 Federation, and nr. J.H. Thomas, the General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen.The   Agreement is as followsPort and Transit Committee Readjustment.At such Ports as may be considered advisable there shall be Port labour Committees which shall exercise the functions now exercised by the existing Port Labour Committees .At such centres as the Central Port and Transit Committee shall determine there shall be local Port and Transit Committees which shall perform functions needful for maintaining the flow of traffic through the Port .2.
