SPpAKY Off BLQQKAjDg INFORMATION 5th * 11th Goto per, 1917.SCANMIU-HA.   The value of the German mark continues to fall onthe Scandinavian bourses. At Copenhagen on Oct. 9 the quotation for 100 marks was 43.80 kroner; at Stockholm on the same day it was 37,613 kroner; at Christian!a on Oct. 8 it was 43.80 kroner, though it subsequently recovered to 44.10. The par of exchange in each case is 88*88 kroner; so that on all three bourses the mark sank to less than 50$ of its normal value. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that the   German Government are reported to be paying gold for their purchases in Copenhagen.l*he Bus si an Government have asked that no formal action of a decisive character shall be taken against the Scandinavian countries until such action has been considered and approved by a Conference of the Allies.   The ground for this request is that Russia cannot afford to risk the suspension of her trade with Scandinavia, or the loss of Swedish transit facilities.Overtures have been made unofficially to our Minister at Stockholm for an agreement between Sweden and the Allies. It appears that the followers of II. Brant ing and also the Liberal party would be prepared to give guarantees against the re-export of imported goods or their products to the enemy; against the employment of such goods for the benefit of the enemy; and against the exportation to the enemy of similar goods of native origin. They would also agree to place a proportion of the Swedish mercantile marine at our disposal, on terms similar to those which we have already arranged with Norway and other neutrals.   These proposals are not altogether satisfactory, %   They do not preclude the export to Germany and Austria Hungary of iron, steel, iron-ore, ferro-alloys and wood-pulp- But Sir  . Howard understands that, although the exports of iron ore could in no case he entirely suspended, they might be consider-
ably reduced.   The new Swedish Government could, he thinks, be induced to prohibit the export of iron-ore, to annul the outstanding ore contracts with Germany, and to insist in future upon high prices and high compensation for eomparative-ly small supplies.   It seems clear that Germany is prepared to pay heavily for Swedish iron-ore.   Already she is endeavouring to counteract our pressure by offering, in compensation for the continuance of ore shipments, commodities of which she herself is greatly in need - cereals, petroleum and lubrieat-ing oil.Denmark has offered to place 100,000 tons of merchant shipping at the disposal of the United States on the understand-ing that she is allowed to import limited quantities of Ameri-can petroleum, copper and cotton.We do not propose to allow the importation into Norway, during the present quarter, of any grain over and above the 70,000 tons which have been promised by the United States Exports Board.   Indeed we have asked the United States Govern-ment whether we may refuse to give letters of assurance for about two-thirds of this quantity.   We are only committed to giving facilities for 28,000 tons, and we have reason to believe that the Exports Board already repent of their unduly liberal bargain with the Norwegian Government,   3?he moment seems favourable for applying pressure to Norway.   Although the Government make a show of unbending obstinacy they are secretly alarmed at the insufficiency of their food-stocks, and they have no effective machinery for rationing the popu-lation.   Sir M. findley thinks that Norway will soon agree to the demands of the Allies. jlMM&amp;AHDS.   Our relations with the Netherlands ean only be dee-scribed as ambiguous.   We are fulfilling our part of the recent bargain as to coal;   and while we have refused special convoy
to Butch colliers leaving- British ports for the Netherlands, we are allowing these vessels to make use of any convoy facilities which are at present available. On the other hand we are stopping all Dutch commercial cables, by way of a pro-i test against the unrestricted transit of gravel and cement frijm Germany to Belgium by Dutch waterways.   Our measure is a drastic one, and entails considerable inconvenience to our-selves.   It has depressed the sterling exchange in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and it has increased the difficulties of our Sugar Commission in purchasing Dutch sugar.   But the transit of gravel and sand and cement has been proceeding on an abnor-mal scale for the past nine months, in spite of energetfco pro-tests on our part and fair promises on the part of the Dutch Government.   Considerable quantities of sand and gravel have moreover been exported from the Netherlands to Belgium; the Dutch shipments in the last ten days of September were nearly 80,000 tons.   Taking the Dutch shipments and the transit ship-ments together, we arrive at an average quantity of 400,000 tone a month of these materials delivered in Belgium during the first nine months of this year,    here is no doubt that the greater part of the shipments are being utilised for military roads and field fortifications on the Western front.We have asked the United States to make no bargain with the Dutch concerning food and fodder until the Dutch have definitely closed with our offers as to coal and shipping. When we have obtained for the Belgian Relief Commission the maximum concessions that the Dutch will make in return for British coal, the United States Exports Board will be able to demand farther concessions in return for American supplies. Unless this course is followed, the Dutch axe likely to outwit the Americans and ourselves, by obtaining payment twice over
4.449for the same concessions,   fortunately the Exports Board are indisposed to negotiate at all with the Dutch delegates until the latter produce definite information as to the foodf-stoeks and requirements of the Netherlands.2), SOUTH AMERICA. The United States are prepared to open negotiations with the Argentine Government for the purchase of the export-able surplus of Argentine wheat.   We have expressed the hope that fodder corn will be included in the purchase scheme. The French Government have now agreed to the principle of direct purchase, abandoning the complicated financial scheme which they at first proposed.The Argentine Government have promised that our protest against the shipping dues and export duties which they recently imposed shall De favourably considered when the Argentine Congress reassembles in November.4.
