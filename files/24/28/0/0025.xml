(&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britarmic Majesty^GoYernme^&quot; \ Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917./  PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.LAND SETTLEMENT.THE question of the provision of land for soldiers on demobilisation has for some time past occupied the attention of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. It is one of the most pressing questions of policy before the country ; it is also one that requires an immediate decision so that the necessary preparations for action may be made before demobilisation begins to take effect. From many sources the Board have been made aware of the widespread demand for land amongst soldiers who are now serving, and of an expectation on their part that as soon as they are freed from the Army they will be&apos; able to obtain in some form or other access to the land. It is anticipated that this demand will come, to a large extent, from men who have not been employed upon the land before they joined the Army, but who were engaged in commercial and-perhaps to a less extent in industrial employment, or from men who had been engaged upon the land before going into the towns.These men are reported to be less attracted by the idea of a small holding as it is usually conceived than by a somewhat indefinite conception of farms where they would work upon a system of co-operative production, or upon a pi out-sharing basis. There is evidence that the idea of a co-operative working and a sense of the value of organisation for production have grown and fixed themselves in such men&apos;s minds as a result of their experience of association and combined working in military service. The opinion appears to be generally expressed by service men that if they cannot obtain land at home at the conclusion of the war they will certainly emigrate in order to secure an outdoor life upon the land. It is also reported that these men are considerably exercised at the prospect of the delays that must take place during demobilisation and the probability that men belonging to the later units to be demobilised will find all the normal openings already filled up.Not only is it clear that the demand for land at. home will be considerable, but it is also evident that great discontent aud irritation will be aroused if land is not forthcoming and if no adequate schemes for settlement are ready at the time the men are set free. It is therefore essential that an immediate decision should be reached on the policy to be adopted, and that steps should be taken at once to give the Government the power of securing at very short notice, in accordance with the demand, the large area of land that may possibly be called for. Even when land has been purchased it is rarely possible to obtain possession and quickly, except by paying the occupiers for disturbance, and any rapid action that might be forced upon the State to meet an emergency demand after the war would be not only costly, but likely to involve considerable disturbance and injustice to existing occupiers.The Board is bound to anticipate a demand for land on a scale that could not be met by the existing agencies for providing small holdings. The Land Colonies scheme (&quot; Small Holdings Colonies Act, 1916 &quot;) will furnish a total of about 4,500 acres in England and 1,500 acres in Wales. At the outside this would provide for from 200 to 300 men, and though the farms acquired may become useful[1027] B
training places for more men than are actually settled afterwards in these colonies this scheme can only touch the fringe of the question.The powers of the County Councils to acquire land for small holding purposes have been practically suspended during the War owing to the restrictions placed on the issue of the necessary loans from the Local Loans Fund. The request to the Treasury to remove these restrictions, originally made on the 25th May, 1917, has recently been renewed, because many of the County Councils recognise the urgency of the situation, and are desirous of immedi-ately taking any opportunities of acquiring suitable land within their areas to meet the demand that they foresee will follow demobilisation. It is unlikely, however, that, unaided, the County Councils will be able to meet all the needs of the situation. They are chiefly concerned with the provision of land for residents within their own boundaries. As, at the end of 1914, the demand from these sources was from 6,432 individuals and two associations for 89,251 acres, County Councils are unlikely to be able to cater in addition for the large numbers of ex-townsmen who wish to settle on the laud.If the openings at present in sight for settlement in England and Wales are thus comparatively small, on the other hand, the Overseas Dominions are taking active steps to attract settlers. In Queensland,Tor example, the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Act of 1917 provides for the setting apart of any Crown land, or of any land acquired for the purposes of this Act (the acquisition of which may be either by agreement or compulsory) for selection as Perpetual Lease Selections by  discharged soldiers, which termincludes &quot; any person who.....has joined the naval or militaryforces of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland during the present war.....&quot;in order to make matters easy for the settlers at the start, no payment of rent or instalment of survey fee is demanded for the first three years. After the expiration of that period the survey fee becomes payable in ten equal instalments. From the fourth to the fifteenth year the annual rent is to be at the rate of H per cent, only of the capital value of the holding. Powers are also given for the making of advances to settlers up to a maximum of 5001. for the purpose of carrying out improvements on their holdings, the rate of interest charged not to exceed 5 per cent, per annum.Further, a Committee, known as the Empire Land Settlement Comm. ttee, is actively engaged in considering the question of facilitating the settlement of ex-service men on the land within the Empire.It will be agreed that it would be a national loss if the men of the stamp the Board has in view were allowed, still more compelled, to go abroad in any large number. Despite the very attractive statements made on behalf of the Dominion, it is doubtful whether the openings available for them are likely to be as good as could be provided here. In the majority of cases nothing more than a bare piece of land, often uncleared and unimproved, would be at the disposal of the settler, with certain credits to enable him to build his house, get in his first crops, and live until he had harvested them. As these credits will be ultimately backed by the credit of the United Kingdom, it may be suggested that similar loans could be equally well extended to settlers at home. In view of the large amount of land existing in this country which is under-populated and underfarmcd, it is the deliberate opinion of the Board of Agriculture that better openings can be provided at home, and at a smaller cost to the Empire&apos;s credit, provided only steps are taken at once to secure access to the land in this country on a large scale. In making this statement, the Board of Agriculture would wish to insist that it has in view not small holdings only in the -usual acceptation of the term. Various classes of men have to be provided for, some of them possessing a certain amount of
capital; and what most attracts the better type of man to the Colonies is the hope of building up a reasonable sized agricultural business by hard work and adventure, rather than the prospect of settling down to the close and comparatively narrow walk of life that is typically presented by a small holding of the English type. Various sizes and types of holdings are therefore necessary, and in many cases they would not need the equipment of buildings, fences, roads, &amp;c, which are judged to be necessary to a statutory small holding. The class of ex-service man whom we are considering wants a piece of land at home just as he would get it in the dominions, comparatively bare and unimproved, so that he could give it an ultimate value by his own labour.There is still in England and Wales a large quantity of under-farmed and unimproved land which could be rendered greatly more productive to the State, and capable of carrying a much larger population if only men were allowed a free hand to throw their labour into its improvement. The fundamental question is how this land is to be made available for the returned soldier or sailor. The ordinary business routine gives him little opportunity ; farms are normally let aud re-let almost exclusively among the farming class ; agents are not likely to alter the character of existing holdings in order to provide for new men. There is evidence, however, that landowners all over the country might not be unwilling to dispose, of portions of their land, especially in such a cause. On the etfeeg^e hand, they are genuinely anxious to help the returned soldier, though they might hesitate to take upon themselves the immediate risks inherent in a settlement policy, and further it is considered by those most conversant with the situation that the trend of recent legislation and the effect of the Corn Production Bill is likely to induce con-siderable sales of land.After consideration, the Board of Agriculture have rejected the idea that any substantial progress can be made towards settlement by working upon a basis of leasing land from owners. The induce-ment to settlement is very largely the prospect of translating the man&apos;s labour into a property that is realisable, or can be handed on to his heirs, and no satisfactory scheme has been suggested by which landowners generally could let off portions of their land on a lease-hold tenure that would be sufficiently long or secure to attract an occupier of the class under consideration. It is not, however, intended to suggest that the settler himself need necessarily become the freeholder. His situation would be perfectly met if he could hold his land under perpetual lease from the State, so as to be free to sell his improvements.The whole question turns upon the heavy commitments with which the State would be faced in order to buy outright the land that is likely to be needed for settlement, and the general appreciation of land values that would be bound to occur if the State came into the market as a necessary purchaser of a million or more acres of land. Despite the security which the possession of the land would offer, the raising of the necessary sum in cash in the present difficult times must weigh against the adoption of the scheme.The Board therefore suggest that the situation should be met by the expedient of purchase, not in cash, but in land stock, and that, if the policy is adopted, the Board should be empowered to deal with landowners willing to sell either whole estates or such portions of them as may be agreed, on the basis of giving in exchange for the land, stock which will produce the proved present net rental value of the land plus a small percentage the State to become and to remain absolute holder of the land.It is realised that this proposal may be criticised from two points of view : first, that as the agricultural situation after the war may be such as would enable landowners to increase rents (both because of the probable increase of business methods of land[1027] B 2
administration, and because good prices for agricultural produce are likely to prevail)., they would be disinclined to hand over their land unless they would-derive some benefit from the rise in values-more especially having regard to the depreciation and loss which many of them suffered during the period of the agricultural depression and, therefore, that far too little land would be offered. But if land were to be acquired on the basis of its proved present rental value, i.c, the present market rental value, and not necessarily the rent at which the land is actually let, it is expected that many owners would prefer the certainty and finality of the settlement proposed to the trouble of attempting to increase their revenue by ordinary meansIt is known also that many land-owning families have almost or entirely disappeared as a result of war casualties, and in these cases new owners or trustees may be very willing to escape from the responsibility of administering an estate if they can do so in a manner which, while ensuring a reasonable income, practically turns the estate into a war memorial of those who have fallen. There is, therefore, a fair prospect of land being offered on the terms proposed. It is hoped that it would be offered in sufficient quantities to meet the purpose in view, but naturally it is not possible to determine whether this will be the case until defined powers to make enquiry and offers are given.Secondly, it may be felt that to give power to a single depart-ment to obtain land for a special purpose, however urgent, will stereotype the procedure for other departments, whereas land acquisition is a general question which should bo worked out for all cases in which the State may desire to obtain land for some public purpose arising out of the war. As to this, it is admitted that the procedure to be followed and the basis of compensation to be awarded in cases of compulsory acquisition of land is a question affecting many departments, and which, it is understood, is about to be examined by a special sub-committee of the Reconstruction Committee. But in the case under consideration it is not proposed to resort to compulsory acquisition of land, at any rate until full enquiry has been made as to the possibility of obtaining it on a voluntary basis. It will be much easier to justif3r a simplification of the methods, and a lessening of the cost, of compulsory land acquisition if it can be shown that it is not possible otherwise to obtain the means required for settlement of soldiers, even though a careful survey and reasonable offers have been made. There seems every reason, therefore, to allow acquisition on the voluntary basis proposed to be undertaken at once, and it cannot be imagined that by the adoption of that course the work of any other department or body will be prejudiced.If this general policy can be agreed upon, the Board of Agriculture would propose to begin by appointing a commissioner of standing, who would privately approach the larger landowners of the country and ask each to have a survey made of his estate, and to report what portions, large and small, he would be prepared to cut off and dispose of to the Board for settlement on these terms. It should not prove difficult to interest the greater landowners of the country in such a movement if they were privately consulted before-hand, and with their backing the scheme would be likely to meet with an adequate response. As regards the character and suitability of the land that would be offered, the survey which is being conducted on behalf of the War Agricultural Committees of all the counties should prove of the utmost value, and would enable, without expense, a preliminary classification to be made of the land that would be available, and this could be followed up by a more exact survey as the demand began to take effect. It is proposed at the same time that the colleges and similar public bodies should be approached as to their estates. There seems to be every prospect of obtaining considerable areas of land from these public bodies in such a national cause, provided that the corporate body could be-
assured that their income would be secured against the risks of loss involved in the experiment of settlement.A further source of land to be explored in this connection is the glebe land and land held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and by charities up and down the country. It is probable that much, if not the whole, of this could be taken over.A further method which the Board would wish to be empowered to act upon, though this might require separate and special legislation, would be the agreement with landowners for the extinction of existing tithe rent-charge upon their land by exchange for a proportionate amount of land. This would, if general, do away with what is sometimes felt as a grievance by occupiers or owners of land, and a possible cause of political dispute. It would also simplify the ownership of land and facilitate transactions in real estate. The same procedure might possibly also be made applicable to land tax.In view of the length of time which must elapse before effect could be given to the policy here suggested of land purchase on a large scale, and of the importance of conducting the negotiations with landowners before popular pressure begins, the Board would press for an early decision on this important question.R. E. PROTHEEO,October 2. 1917.
