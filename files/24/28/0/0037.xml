11 * Use of Military and Auxiliary Hospitals for Discharged Menv An Army Council Instruction has now been issued by the War Office embodying arrangements for the medical treatment&apos; of men after discharge, in military and auxiliary hospitals, in accordance with arrangements arrived at between the Ministry and the Army Council. A copy of the Instruction is given in Appendix XII.The principal modifications of the existing procedure are briefly as follows:-(a) Ar-y Form 3555 prescribing the kind iDf treatment which a man needs on discharge from military service is enlarged to enable further particulars of the treatment necessary to be given and it is further provided that this card will be sent in every case on a man&apos;s discharge from Hospital, whether he is treated or not, in order to enable Local War Pensions Committees to keep tally of all cases .(b) Cases of men needing institutional treatment some time after discharge can how be dealt with by reference to a military hospital y/here they would be given in-patient or cut-patient treatment, but this will be limited (as it is limited now under the Instructions of the Ministry) tc cases of wound or injury sustained in service.(c) Red Cross and other auxiliary Hospitals are definitely authorised to accept discharged men for treatment eltnerr asin or out-patients, on terms agreed upon.Appointment of Medical Referees.   Active steps have beentaken by the Ministry since the issue of Instructions forTreatment and Training to obtain the services of MedicalPractitioners of good standing to act as medical referees.-Advertisements were inserted, in the medical press and LocalWar Pensions Coirmittees have been asked to state their viewsas to the Areas in each County for which Medical Refereeswill be required.   Applications have now been received fromthe large majority of areas and the Ministry are proceedingto
jrCr Uo v appcdjitment of the most suitable candidates.   Dor the purpose of seleot-ing, names to be recommended to the Minister a small Committee has been formed consisting of two representatives of the Central Medical War Committee (Doctora Shore and Foulton) and representatives of the Local Government Board, and .of the Insurance Commissioners for England, Wales and Scotland and of the Ministry.   The Committee held its first meeting on the 3rd instant and was able to recommend f vr appointment practitioners in. a number of rural Counties.Conference at Ministry of Motional Service.   The Ministry was represented by invitation on the 4th instant at the first meeting of a Medical Advisory Committee appointed by the Minister of National Service, to consider the measures to be adopted for (a) obtaining a reliable survey of the physical condit on of the population of military age to far as it is not at present in military service (b^ determining uniform criteria   of fitness for the various branches of military work   and (c) arranging a system of non-military primary medical Boards and of Medical Assessors for the assistance of Appeal Tribunals. 14. General Schemes of Treatment.   Appendix XIII contains a report of the general schemes of treatment proposed or sanctioned during the week ended the 3rd instant. 15. Individual Cases of Treatment.    The great bulk of cases of treatment are under general schemes which have received approval, but a small number of eases requiring special treatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has noct previously been given are submitted each week. During the week ended 3rd October, 101 such cases were so sanctioned.16. Numbers under Treatment.   Appendix XIV shows the number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whomallowances
allowances under Article 6 of tho Royal Warrant are payable.

Treatment and Training of Officers.   Since the inauguralmeeting of the Committee on this subject referred to in the Report No. XXXVI they have settled for their own guidanceregulations under Articles 6 and 7 of the Royal Warrant andhave issued forms of application for Treatment and Training.In the Treatment Branch steps have been taken to-ibtain definite information concerning hospitals available for officrs on retired pay and tho National HealthInsurance Commission have been approached for a list of suitable sanatoria.   During the last fortnl-ht 51 officers have b^on placed upon the treatment register by the Department; 23 of those have applied for medical expenses, 2 cases arc undergoing treatment and 2 attendant allowances have been awarded.   Sir Alfred Poarco Gould is advising the Committee in this Branch.In the Training Branch the Committee have approached some of the Universities and the Boarfc of Education onthe subject of available courses *f Instruction.   54 Officrs have applied for training and 25 who are con-sidered likely to benefit by it have been communicated with, the applications of other candidates are under conaideration. Dr. Garnott is advising the Committee in this matter.Training.21 * &quot;Special&quot; Tradoc^   Further supplementary Instructions have now been prepared for the training of disabled men in the Leather Goods trade and !h the Hand-sown boot and shoo making and repairing trade; a copy, with one of anexplanatory
explanatory note are given in Appendix XVII. These instructions   are being Issued to Local Committees. Further Insu-ni otions on training In other trades will follow at short intervals.A report on the openings for disabled men in tho Furniture trade (No.5 of the openings in industry scries issued by the Ministry of Labour) is given in AppendixXVIII.   This trade is one of those most frequently chosen by disabled men especially in rural districts, and these, instructions should prove of substantial assistance to Local Committees.Appendix XIX contains a report of the meetings hold during the week of tho Central Trado Advisory Committees formed by the Ministry In conjunction with tho Ministry of Labour in the Leather Goods Trado, the Cinema Trade and the Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe making and repairing, trade.22 *  ciLer l^^eH?.Q cf Training.-   Appendix XX contains a report of the general- proposals for courses of trainingsubmitted by Local Committees during the week.23. Individual cases of Training. Owing to the comparativeease-with which employment is obtained now, the number of..men offering themselves for training is, in the aropf of anyLocal .. &apos; Isingle/dommittee, usually limited and frequently there arenot enough men to call for general schemes of training.iIn consequence a large proportion of the men who are admitted to training are the subject cf individual application and sanction by the Ministry,   During the tveck  j I ended the 3rd instant, 41 cases of training wore thus sanctioned.   Of these 9 were to be trainad in boot and shocHrepairing, 9 in tho trades oonnectqd with- engineering, and fjlMm4 In motor mechanics. pp?-   &apos; * 111mm24&quot; Number of Men under Training. Appendix XXI shows that   jI &apos;! -80 men wore admitted to training by Local Committees during; the week and that the total number reported as und^r train4 \
ing at the end of the week was 365.     About two-thirds ofthe number were under training in Technical Institutes.These numbers do not include men whoso training courses wereapproved under the Statutory Committee Regulations.25*   Training for Widows.     Article 14 of the Royal Warrantand Order in Council of the 29th March allows of training0being provided for widows who are in receipt either of a permanent pension under Article&apos; 11 or of an alternative   .. pension   based on the pre-war earning? of the husband under Article 13.     Owing to the readiness with which women are now able to obtain employment of all kinds there is at present very little demand for the training for widows.A few applications have, however, been received, and to enable Local Committees to deal with tho matter on systematic lines, instructions have now been drawn up for their guidance, a copy of which is given in Appendix XXII*     The explanatory note preceding the instructions sets out the principles on which training  ill be provided^     Tho -ea&amp;d. for providing training for the widow is necessarily on a differ-&apos;:nt footing from that of the re-education of the disabled man.     But the general principles governing the lattor, namely the suitability of the applicant for the trade, the thoroughness of training, and the importance of training in an ocoupation which Is likely to provide a permanent employment, apply equally to the case of the widow,Ti:-. Ministry are pursuing very careful enquiry, with the help of the Board of Education, the Ministry of Labour, and Women&apos;s Employment Bureaux and through the Federation of Women&apos;s Trades Unions as to the trades for which training can be suitably&apos;      provided and the conditions under which such trainin should be given, and it is hoped shortly to issue to Local Coonittees an account of the results of these investigations.Up

Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for the weak ending 3rd October are eontalnod in Appendix XXIII *Lancashire Subcommittees are well reported on and work is easy to obtain.   From Loigh, it is roported that disabled men almost invariably find work with their old employers and do not require assistance.   St. Helenls Local Committee although their attention has been called to the matter appear to make grants to widows without due discrimination.   Spcnborough Local Committee (West Riding) also object to alter their procedure with respect to grants to widows.   Lindsoy (Lincolnshire) is well spoken of.Tho work of Inverness County has largely increased during tho past quarter and the scattered population and difficulties of travelling would seom to require a correspondent in each parish) the work of Inverness (town) Local Committee continues to be satisfactory.Kilkenny has made a start and the Monaghan accounts are well kept.Ptnsions Ministry in Reconstruction.   In a letter of August 18th to the. Minister, Dr. Addlson made various enquiries with rospcot to tho work of the Pensions Ministry in relation to after-war problems.   The reply to this letter in the form of a memorandum, is given in Appendix XXIV.Dr. Addison has now suggested that tho present occupations of discharged men should be investigated and steps are being taken with this in view.28.
28- British &amp; Foreign Press.     Appendix XXV contains a report on recent articles in the British and ForeignPress.   The report refers to the United Statei scheme for the. insurance of soldiers; it deals with French andBelgian Articles on the treatment of war deafness, latenttuberculosis and shell shock, and there are notices ofarticles discussing the training and employment of disabled men.In Germany it is found that the Government pensions need supplementation&quot;and the town of Elberfeld has fixedrates for widows and children in addition to fehrj Government Grants; difficulty is experienced by the German Government in distinguishing between attributable and non-attributable disablement and precautions are being taken to guardagainst pensions being granted for disablement duo to se)Lf mutilation for the purpose of escaping further service. 29*War Pensions Gazette.   In the sixth issue of this Gazette (Appendix XXVI) Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen points out in h leading article entitled &quot;A Ministry of Restoration&quot; that the duties of this Ministry go far beyond the mere award of pensions and extend to the treatment of the disabled, to their re-education where necessary and to finding them employment.   The Gazette also contains an article on National Health Insurance, a detailed account of the work of the Swansea Local Committee, a brief note on the work of the Statutory Committee and an explanation of the relations between the Ministry and the Speoial Grant s C ommi 11 e e .Staff etc30 * Numbers of Staff.

The air raids were responsible for some of the absences. 31. Resignations, etc.   During the month of September the staff increased from 4,003 to 4,426 or by 423; 4 men and 16G women resigned, 3 women were transferred and 1 woman was dismissed.

Wgrk of Awards to Widows and Dependant a Branoh.Up to tho 15th Fobruary, 1917, when tho Ministry of Pensions commenced operations tho War Office and Admiralty had grantedPensions to Widows 59.000Allowances to children 122,000 Pensions to Parents and otherDependants 28,000Pensions, t^ unmarried Wives 700 Allowances to children ofunmarried wives 1,300211,000Since the 15th February. 1917. the Ministry have granted the following pensionsPonsions to Widows 33,000Allowances to ohildron 64,000 Ponsions t*. Parents and othorDependant 3 60,5G0Pensions to unmarried wives 600 Allowanoos to ohildren of UnmarriedWives 1,000Allowances to Illegitimate   ohildren 900160,000This gives a gross total of more than 370,000 pensions and children1s allowances from the commencement of the War until tho present time.In addition to the foregoing about 30,000 grants of pension to widows and 60,000 allowances to ohildren have been prepared in readine33 for issue as soon as tho 26 weeks for whioh Separation Allowance is payable has expired.Tho Issue of the Royal Warrant and Ordor in Council of Mapoh, 1917, with their Improved rates of pension and altered conditions of entitlement necessitated the earliest possible reassessment ofWidows pensions 68,000Children&apos;3 Allowances 135,000Parents&apos; pensions 72,000275,000With the oxooption of about 8,000 parents1 caso3 still in hand the whole of these have been reassessed and the new rates wf pension are in issue.The changed conditions of entitlement necessitated tho reconsideration - a vory difficult matter- of about 4,700 widows&apos; .and dependants&apos;claims which had boen rejected by the War Offico or Admiralty under tho old conditions.     Tn3 result has been that in 3,000 of these cases the widow or othor dependant has beon admitted to pension, while in 300 cases the refusal has been upheld after the fullest consideration.     The balance of 1400 wore oases of porsono who had claimed as dopendanta tent were found on investigation not to have been dependants.
In addition to the purely pension work there have been authorized sinco tho 4th April, 1917, 60,000 grants of  5. to the widows of men killed or dying since the 1st July, 1916,The correspondence in connection with tho award of pensions is very largo and more than 500,.000 letters and forma have boen despatchod from tho branch since tho 4th April last, and the documents which have to be clo3oly examined- certificates of marriage and birth, declarations, reports of Courts of Enquiry and of inveoti-gations into facts as to dependenco - approximate to the same number.The n^w Sohemo of parents&apos; spocial pensions recently announced in tho Pross io expected to give rise to a very largo number of claims - possibly 80,000 in tho course of tho noxt six months and machinery for dealing with these is approaching completion.The growth of the work has led to a corresponding incroaso of Staff which from a total of just over Boo on the 4th April has now reached the figure of 750 of whom a&quot;bout 7&amp;5 are women.Further additions of 50 or 100 may be necessary for dealing with the Scheme referred to in the preoeding paragraph.

Committee on Institutional.Treatment.The twenty fourth meeting of the Committee was held on Thursday 4th October.     Present:-Sir A. EoscawenSir Walter LawrenceTibe Hon. Sir A. StanleySir A. P. GouldSir John CollieDr. Bond, andSir H. Haward.1, Minutes.     Dr. Bond pointed out that he had understood that Sir A. Boscawen would see Lady Meath and that he had not written to her.    Sir A. Boscawen stated that he would now arrange for Lady Meath to have an interview with him and Dr. Bond.    Subject to this correction the Minutes were passed.2* Convalescent Homes.   Sir A. Boscawen stated that he was informed* Kat there was great need for such homes, but that little provision had been made.     He thought that cases should only be sent If certified by the Medical Referee and Local Committee.     The Medical Referee should recommend for what tlms treatment was to be given.     It was for the Committee to consider whether they should take up the provision.     It appeared that the small V.A.D. Hospitals were being closed and it was agreed that the County Directors should be asked to advise as to what Hospitals would be willing to be taken over by the Ministry of Pensions for this purpose.     Sir A.Boscawen desired to be able to place the Homes at the disposal of the Joint Area Committees to be filled from the whole area.     It was agreed to begin with the Home Counties and Sir A. Boscawen undertook to have the County Directors of this area invited to discuss the proposal.     In the meantime the Treatment Branch was to draw up a scheme to be submitted to the Red Cross Society. It was considered that the Homes would be managed locally under the supervision of the Joint Committee.     The Medical Referee., of the district in which a Home was situate might ac  as visitor and report on the progress of cases.     It was held that a man and his family would be entitled to the Treatment grants whilst he was in a Convalescent Home.     The cost of maintenance might be met - as to the chief part - by a capitation fee.3. Rheumatic Cases.     Sir A. Boscawen stated that Rheumatic cases were very numerous, and suggested that the Committee should consider the extension of its sphere and the fuller utilization of Spas at Bath, Droitwich and Llandrindod in the same manner as was being done at Moffatt and Strathpeffer. Sir Walter Lawrence and Sir A,P.Gould both thought that the number of cases was likely to be very large.     it was agreed that it was desirable to have more exact particulars as to what would be needed.     Sir W. Lawrence undertook to obtain information from the War Office and Mr. Boughey was tc get the figures of discharges for Rheumatism from Chelsea.
4. Neurasthenics.     Sir. J   Collie- presented his Report, Abbotsford House was&quot;getting&quot;on under the West of England Joint Committee.     Mr. Rose, who had done excellent work as organiser of games &amp;c. at St. Dunstan&apos;s, had offered his services in a like capacity at Highfield.     Sir J. Collie thought that such an official would be very useful at all Neurasthenic Homes.     It was agreed to recommend the House Committee to appoint Mr. Rose to act in a temporary capacity as occupation organiser.     There were now 95 men in Golders Green and there was a waiting list of about 100.     Some had been discharged for insubordination, but under Dr. Pearnside the Home was working well and there had been numerous cure3. It was agreed that a Monthly Return should be made showing the number admitted;     the number left of free will, for insubordination, or as cured, and why men recommended had failed ts come;    the Return to be made at the end of every month and circulated to the Committee and the Ministry.     Sir J. Collie reported that ab^ut half those recommended failed to come;   tho Special Medical Board did not think it judicious to apply our penal powers in Neurasthenic cases, but they would consider its application and report further.The adoption of similar returns for other classes was discussed.     It was agreed that Quarterly Returns would be sufficient for Paraplegics and Tuberculosis.     Dr. Bond thought that Epileptics were not yet ripe for such a Return. Sir A. Stanley put in a statement as to the agreements for the houses for Nurses at Highfield.     Out of this there arose a question as to the liability for dilapidations at the end of the teriru     It was suggested that it might be regarded properly as part of the cost of maintenance to be met out of the capitation fee.     Sir A* Stanley reported that a road in the grounds was in urgent need of repair, and an expenditure of  70 for this purpose was authorized.Sir A.Pi Gould called attention to an article in the Weekly Dispatch for September 23rd, which had caused much dis-satisfaction.     Sir J. Collie explained how the article -by Mr. Max Pemberton - came to be written.     It was agreed that in future visitors should not be admitted except with a pase from the Ministry, Sir J. Collie or the Committee of Management any pass to be granted on condition that no article was written for publication.     Dr. Bend undertook to consult with the Secretaries of the Epileptic Colonies on this question.At Cral^ Avon there were 16 in Hospital.Allerton Hall     Sir A. Stanley put in a statement as to a difficulty which had arisen with reference to two fields; until possession could be giv*n the Rent would be reduced to&apos;  500 per annum.     Estimates had been received for the internal work, chiefly for protection against firs.     The lowest estimate was for  325, the expenditure of which sum was approved,Leicester Frith. An additional wing was being built. Good progress was being made but it would not be ready till November.Woodboume.     There had been many difficulties.     Sir J. Collie agreed to visit, and explain that if a satisfactory settlement was not arrived at other accommodation must besecured.
secured.Westgate House.     Sir J, Collie doubted whether it would be needed for Neurasthenic Officers and suggested that it might be useful for borderland cases.     3ut on a report by-Sir A. P. Gould that many cases of Neurasthenic Officers had come under his notice it was agreed to proceed as proposed.Leopardstown.    Good progress was being made,Lrymna Scriven,     it was understood that the Ministry were dealing with this.5. Epileptics *     Dr. Bond reported on a visit which he had paid to Besford Court, Worcestershire.     It was a splendid place, wtiich had been developed regardless of expense in an old Tudor mansion.     Primarily it was meant for mentally defective children, but they also proposed to take Epileptics, The superintendent was ready to help, and the institution, though Roman Catholic, would not be confined to persons of  ; that persuasion.     The authorities would either put up a temporary building similar to the one at Lingfield or give up half the existing building for soldiers, which would mean 70 beds.     The superintendent was anxious for a visit, and Sir A, Boscawen said he would endeavour to arrange.     The consent of the Board of Education to its use would probably be required.Monylmll     Dr. Bond had visited and explained what was required.     The Villa was to be ready by the 1st November and was to have a distinctive name*     The men were to have the option of wearing their own clothes, or in the alternative to be dressed differently from the other InmatescMaphull..     Inquiry was made as to tfias provision for bedsteads, and the procuring of Carbide of Calcium.     It was reported that the Ministry of Munitions were unable to sanction the Carbide of Calcium.Chalfonto     The work would be completed in three sections -25 beds in mid-November, 25 beds in mid-December, and 25 beds in mid-January.6. The next meeting was appointed to be held on Thursday,18th October.
APPENDIX XII. fFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.]ARMY COUNCIL INSTRUCTION.No. 1531 of 1917.War Office,6th October, 1917.53^  The   Continued Treatment Discharged Soldiers.and   Training   ofThe following Instructions are issued in substitution for I.C.Is. 449, 626, and 795 of 1917, which are hereby cancelled.1. The Ministry of Pensions and War Pensions Committees ftablished in the several counties and county boroughs and in ytain large towns are charged with the duty of securing any edical treatment or training for industrial life that a discharged ikiier may need. It is important, therefore, that officers i/c ospitals should be placed in relation with these Committees in a lanner to be presently described.2. With reference to A.C.I. 1912 of 1916, it must.be borne in land that so long as in-patient treatment is required, whether k means of curative manual exercises or by other means, and pcommodation is available, soldiers will be retained in the ippropriate hospitals.On the termination of such treatment, if the&apos; men are con-idered to be unfit for further service, they will be brought before ii invaliding board, but will not be discharged from hospital until lie date of their actual discharge from the. service, i.e., 21 days fter their discharge has been approved by the invaliding board. This procedure will be followed in; the ease of all soldiers in ospital who are about to be discharged from the service&apos; on ledical grounds, except in limbless and mental cases, and cases f tuberculosis who accept sanatorium treatment. .Men who have been fitted with an artificial limb may be allowed o leave hospital before the expiration of 21 days provided that the elatives or friends of the.man expressly state that they are able ad willing to take him, and that satisfactory arrangements can be mde to ensure his receiving his pay up to the date of his discharge rom the army, i.e., 21 days after his invaliding board. ; &apos;(b&apos;13258-1569)   20m   10/17   h &amp; s   A. 17/1569
lie t hencoca vleceireal ote 0 di .3 ilit tisiMental cases which are to be discharged under the provision^ivii paras. 403-410 King&apos;s Eegulations (see A.O.I. 1171 of 1917), are suitable cases to be handed over to the care of. friends, m provided the friends are able and willing to look after them, be handed over as soon as their discharge has been approved by t invaliding board.Oases which are unsuitable to be handed over to friends may sent to the asylum to which they are chargeable as soon practicable after their discharge has been approved by the inva ing board, instead of being retained in the military hospital for full period of m days.Medical officers should, as far as possible, anticipate the date which the patient will-complete his in-patient treatment in ore that the soldier&apos;s documents may be obtained and the board 1 approximately 21 days before that date.   This procedure &quot;obviate any undue congestion of hospital beds.a. treatment of cases on discharge.3. When a soldier has been approved for discharge from army on medical grounds, and when he is subsequently dischargt :from the hospital, or command depot, or other unit in the case i iman not in hospital,.some further treatment as an out-patient ( in.special cases, e.g., tuberculosis or paraplegia, as an in-pati( ;may. be necessary.  Where out-patient treatment is required it m toften be suitably afforded at a military hospital or in a V.A.D iR-ed Cross auxiliary hospital (see para. 12), and whenever a L War Pensions Committee presents such cases for treatment should be afforded for as long a.period as may be required so &quot;as available resources permit., 4. In order that Local Committees may be able to make then ^selves fully acquainted with the needs of men whom it is propo: to invahd, the fullest facilities should be given to duly accredi representatives of these Committees appointed as &quot; Hosp Visitors &quot; to visit and confer with the hospital authorities, or 1 the medical authorities of the command depot, or other unit in . case of a man not in hospital, and the man concerned.  :. &apos;  In addition to treatment, an appropriate course of technic! training may for many of the cases be desirable. ; The pr vision of the means for such training rests with the Ministry pensions, and full information bearing upon such matters should placed at the disposal of the hospital visitor, and the officers i hospitals should assist with advice or in any way that lies witl their power.:; - &apos;:5.&apos;As soon as the-soldier has been approved for invaliding fix the army, the officer -i/c hospital, or in the case Of a man not -hospitaly the president of the travelling or invaliding inedi board, will forward to the Secretary of the Local Committee df t1 district in which the man proposes to reside a card (A.F. W. 355on
(b 13258-1569)ing full particulars with regard to the man, his disability and of treatment recommended for him.   If no treatment is reconi-ended, the fact should be stated on the card, but in any case, a d will be sent, as this notification is necessary to enable the :al Committee to visit the man immediately on discharge. Where treatment is recommended at a military hospital or at a L&apos;D- or-lied Gross hospital the card will be sent to the officer i/c s hospital in which it is recommended that the man shouldceive treatment, and the officer of that hospital will, if the atment can be given there, return it to the Committee with a te on it when the treatment is completed.Officers i/c hospitals, or presidents of travelling or invaliding dical boards, as the case . may be, will distinguish on A.F. . 3555 between (a) cases which require out-patient treatment at a litary orthopaedic hospital, and (b) those which can be dealt with isfactorily at a general hospital, military or civil.(a) Cases falling under one or more of the following head-ings will be certified for treatment at a military ortho-pasdic hospital, their cards (A.F. W. 3555) being marked &quot;Orthopaedic A&quot; :-(i) Disabilities of hands and feet.(ii) Bony or fibrous ankylosis of joints requiring operative or manipulative treatment in order to restore functions, or flail-joints requiring operative or mechanical fixation.(iii) Mal-united or&apos; un-united fractures or any type of functional disability following fracture.(iv) Stiff or useless limbs the result of injuries to nerves, especially cases where nerve suturing having failed tendon transplantation is indicated.(v) Various contractions of the extremities due to scar tissue.(vi) Derangements of the knee due to injury of the semi-lunars or following upon operations for this condition.(b) Other orthopaedic cases requiring out-patient treatmentwill be marked on A.F. W. 3555 &quot; Orthopaedic B &quot; for . treatment at a civil or military general hospital.Treatment of post-discharge cases.6. Men who have been discharged from the service on medical ounds, and are subsequently found to be in need of further .&apos;atment, may be given such further treatment on the lines heated in para. 3.Such cases may also, if. considered necessary, receive in-patient ?atment at&apos;a military hospital, if facilities are available, under the laditions laid down in A.C.I. 210 of 1917.
In order, however, to keep within reasonable limits, the cas which may receive out- or in-patient treatment in accordance wii this para., it has been decided to limit the cases which may thjj]]&apos;;&apos; be sent for treatment to cases of wounds or injury sustained duri military service.7. All post-discharge eases will, in the first instance, apply the Local War Pensions Committee, who will refer the man (unle the case is immediate and urgent, or the character of the case obvious) to a medical referee, who will determine whether the ca is one of wound or injury sustained during military service, an if he so finds, the man will be referred to a military hospital examination.8. The officer i/c the military hospital to which the man is sei under the provisions of the preceding para., will cause the man f be examined and will enter full particulars on the treatment car (A.F. W. 3555), which he will immediately forward to the Loc; Committee by whom the man was referred. He will also give on copy of the completed card to the man examined.A.F. W. 3555 will be clearly endorsed in red ink with the wora &quot; Post-Discharge Case &quot; at the top of Part I by the medical ofhYj examining the man, who will also record his opinion on the for] as to: (a) The nature of the man&apos;s complaint;(h) Whether treatment can be given in the hospital where tlman was examined, and if not, to what hospital he shouibe referred;(c) If in&quot; or out-patient treatment should be given;(d) The probable period of treatment, so far as can be foreseeifjThis treatment card will be accepted by the Local Wa Pensions Committee as authority for making the necessar arrangements for the man&apos;s further treatment, which treatmeii! should, if practicable, be given at the military hospital where tli man was examined.0. General Arrangements for securing treatment on or after dischargt 9. It will be necessary to give the widest possible publicity t the facilities thus to be afforded to discharged soldiers, and to tbi end a poster has been issued by the Ministry of Pensions, copies cj which should be displayed in a prominent position in each wan and in any other convenient and conspicuous position in t\\ hospital, command depot or camp.The lists of Local Committees therein referred to will supplied by the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Mil bank, S.W. 1.Supplies of the card should be demanded in the usual manna Further copies of the poster will be supplied on application to till Ministry of Pensions.
10. The D.D.M.S. of the Command will furnish to the MinistryIor Pensions and to the Local Committee, lists of the military hospitals which will serve the various districts concerned; also a list of special hospitals in the command, stating the nature of the special treatment afforded in each.   The D.D.M.S. will also affordIany further information and advice to any Local Committee or Joint (Disablement) Committee within the area of the command.11. The details connected with the attendance of men for ifurtlier treatment will be arranged locally by officers i/c hospitals 111!consultation with the secretaries of the Local Committees.12. Payment for the treatment of discharged soldiers as out-Ipatients at V.A.D. or Red Cross auxiliary hospitals will be made by the Ministry of Pensions to the hospitals concerned at a rate decided upon by the Ministry of Pensions and the Committee of he British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John. No [yment should be made from Army Funds in connection with the Hospital treatment either as in-patients or out-patients of pen-;iouers at V.A.D. or Red Cross auxiliary hospitals.24/Gen.

The scheme further provided for the use of the Herbert Convalescent Home at 15/- per week &amp; the Southport Hydropathic Hospital at a charge of 26/- per weejr and l/- for special baths when ordered, ThThose proposals have been approved,2, The Peebles Local committee submitted a proposal toutilise the Peebles Wat? Hospital and 3 Auxiliary Hospitals situated In Peebles,     In the case of the Moorlands Hospital no information was given as to the fees payable and further enquiries have been made,   -The remaining institutions have agreed to terms within the Schedule rates and these have accordingly been sanctioned for general use,3, , The Hewcastle-on-Tyne Local Committee asked forsanction to include the Silloth Convalescent Home in their general scheme.     This Home Is more than 50 miles from the area of the Committee $ut is the nearest available institution on the coast *     The fees payable are 18/- per week and the proposal has been sanctioned,.4. The \iliesden Local Committee have submitted adetailed scheme for the treatment of discharged men in their area, which appears to provide adequately for all oases likely to require treatment under existing conditions.     The scheme has been sanctioned for general use, the use of tho Willesden Cottage Hospital for out-patients being restricted to cases in which electrical or other special treatment is required in view of the proposed fees *     In the case of the VJillesden Council&apos;s Clinic, which the Committee desire to use for surgical dressings in special cases outside the scope of ordinary panel doctor treatment, the fees exceed the authorised rates, and there is no information as.to whether the equipment of the Clinic is adequate for the proposed treatment.    Arrangements are being made to have thasi institutions inspected, by the Local Government Boardj and the Committee have been informed that if the result is satisfactory the proposal will be sanctioned in view of the difficulty experienced by them In obtaining this form of treatment at the available Military Hospitals without undue inconvenience to men suffering from injuries,5, . The Birmingham Local Committee1s scheme for thetreatment of certain neurasthenic cases by.providing light employment under the Parks Committee of the Town Council has now been sanctioned experimentally.     It has been arranged that the Travelling Unit of the Special Medical Board shall advise the Committee as to the suitability of the men for the proposed course,     Sir John Collie who has also heen consulted in the matter considers that the scheme may be given a trial *
6. The v;est Riding Committee of Yorkshire has appliedfor sanction to use a Convalescent Home which is being started by voluntary enterprise at Bridlington,&apos; at a fee of  1 per week.     This has been agreed to if the necessary arrangements for securing a house and suitable staff can be made.7. The Derbyshire Local Committee have represented thegreat difficulty in obtaining massage treatment for men in outlying parts of their area.     They propose to use the services of a qualified masseuse at a fee of 2/6 per visit for cases treated by her in Belper and Duffield and 5/- per visit at-Ilkeston.     In view of the special circumstances this proposal has been sanctioned.

Note on Supplementary Instructions as to &quot;Special Trades.&quot;(Addendum to page 42 of the &quot; Instructions and Notes on Treatment and Training of Disabled Men&quot;)The general conditions of training are laid down in Schedules III and IV. to the Instructions,!lbut Instruc-tion 23 provides that detailed conditions of training in a particular trade may also be laid down by the Minister of Pensions, and that any such trade will then be known as a &quot; special trade.&quot; The primary object of training is to equip the disabled man so thoroughly in the technique of the trade that he will stand a reasonable likelihood of gaining a permanent living after his training. The kind of training necessary to secure this object can only be satisfactorily determined so far as the skilled trades are concerned by the advice of the trade itself, and the Trade Advisory Committees referred to on page 42 of the Instructions and Notes have been formed with the object of giving this advice.The accompanying Supplementary Instructions deal with the conditions of training in the Cinema (Picture Theatre) trade, the Furniture trade, the Boot and Shoe making (Hand-sewn) and repairing trade, and the Leather Goods trade. They have been determined by the Minister in consultation with the Trade Advisory Committees of the trades concerned, and lay down the conditions which, in the opinion of representatives of the trades, should ordinarily govern the training of disabled men in those trades. Local Committees should bear these&quot; conditions in mind when framing proposals for dealing either with individual cases or with a number of men.Power is reserved to the Ministry to approve a departure from the conditions laid down, but it should be understood that exceptional circumstances will have to be shown to justify this. These conditions should be regarded as the standard and normal conditions of training in the trades concerned, wherever they are applicable.x   (37)4110   Wt 514 G 88   100   10/17   E &amp; STREATMENT AND TRAINING.
It will be seen that provision is made in each case feu-the possibility of Local Technical Advisory Committees? formed of representatives of employers and employed, being set up in certain centres of the trade by the Centrai Trade Advisory Committee, and their advice will be of great assistance- to the Local War Pensions Committee, particularly in the matter of adjudging the suitabilitv both of the training and of the men to be trained, and the prospects of employment after training.Moreover, Local Technical Advisory Committees will, it is hoped, stimulate employers both to provide training and employment in their, trades, and so will be of direct assistance to Local Committees.On page 3 will be found a list of towns in which it is suggested that Local Technical Advisory Committees should be set up. These towns have been selected with especial reference to their suitability for the provision of Technical School training. It is not, however, contem-plated that training shall only be given in a place where a Local Technical Advisory Committee has been set up. and if adequate training can be provided under the conditions laid down in these Instructions at the town where the man lives, there is nothing to be gained by sending him to one of these centres at a distance from his home. Where, however, a Local Committee desires tc train a man at one of these centres and away from his home, they should, arrange for the training with the Loca Committee of that centre. In doing so they should sent full particulars of the man, the nature of his disablement and of his general capacity, and should, if possible, have the man passed as suitable for the trade by a competen judge, e.g., a foreman or worker in the trade, in order l( avoid the possibility of the man being found unsuitable after his training has begun. 48Local Technical Advisory Committees will be set u] officially by the Ministry of Labour, and, if deemee representative of the trade in the area by the Ministr of Pensions, the Local Committee of the area will b informed. Already certain of the Local Technical Advisor Committees have been provisionally set up by the trade e.g., in the Cinema and Leather&apos; trades, and may b consulted by Local Committees pending notification c their formal constitution.

training will be issued next week.The Committee were apprehensive as to whether men in rural districts would obtain adequate training and it was decided that the Ilinistry of Pensions should be consulted as to whether there should not be some system of special inspects ion by trade experts where there was any reason to doubt the adequacy of the training.At the request of the Ministry of Pensions the Trade Advisory Committee appointed two representatives, one of employers and one of workpeople to inspect the training given to disabled men in this trade at Queen Llary1 s Hospital Brighton and Roehampton.
APPENDIX XX. TRAINING.Report on Schemes of training submitted ar sanctioned during week ended 3rd October 1917*1, The Kent Local Committee havo submitted proposals fortraining disabled men in &quot;boot making and repairing at Kessfcs, Randall and Co. Llaidstone.     This will be sanctioned subject to the conditions of training being in conformity generally with the instructions now being issued as to the conditions under which training in this trade should be given.2. At an interview with representatives of the WimbledonLocal Committee it was stated that in many oases great delay occurred in making arrangements for training at. Institutes in the area of the London Local Committee.    This was found to be due largely to the fact that explications had to be submitted to the Trade Panels in London in order to determine the suit*-ability of men for the particular trades.     The resulting delay was compensated for by the certainty that the trade as a whole was working in conjunction with the Ministry.     The Committee were informed that if a man had hf t definite training arranged for him which could not be cfmrnonced forthwith, their ftest course would be either to place him in somo ijemporary employment, or to give him some kind of preliminary training which the Minister would be prepared to consider favourably whenever his sanction was necessary.     It appeared that on these lines the difficulties mentioned would be removed,It was also stated that a certain number of men were abandoning the training which they had begun, as they could obtain higher wages than the amount of the maintenance allowance, and that they could not be induced to complete the training by fear of the forfeiture of the bonus which they would otherwise secure on completion of their training,     In order to meet this difficulty the representatives suggested that the provisions cf Article 4, should be extended to training cases, and that at the same time the maintenance allowance for a man in training should be raised ty? the Trade Union rate of wages in the occupation for which he was being trained.3. Consideration has been given to the question of providingtraining in fruit grov/ing, and a list of persons able to give instruction on this subject has been obtained from representatives of the Board of Agriculture.The representatives of the Ministry have been informed of the names of such persons resident within their areas and requested to consult with them, Yfith a v^ew to the submission of schemes of training in this occupation,4. A communication has been received from the London LocalCommittee concerning the interpretation of Instruction 22, and the eligibility for training of men who before enlistment were clerks and now wish to improve their qualifications.     The Committee have been informed that they should first consider whether a man&apos;s disablement is such as to make it desirable to train him; and that a Course of Trai-nin^ may be advisable not only where he is obliged to change his occupation, but also -where his disablement has resulted in debility or ot.,er incapacity to an extent which would prejudice his future earning capacity.     In such cases sanction would be given for the training of the man with a view to improving his earning capacity.     The Committee have also been informed that whenever the training can conveniently be given in evening classes while the man is at work in the day time sanction can be given to the payment of the necessary fees,although the allowances under Article 6. and Instruction 33. would not be payable.

INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TRAINING OF WIDOWS.prefatory note.The Royal Warrant and Order in Council allow of training being given to the majority of widows in receipt of a pension, namely, those who are in receipt of a minimum pension under Article 11, of an alternative pension under. Article 14. The appended Instructions are for the guidance of Local Committees in submitting applications for. sanc-tion.The training of widows is on a somewhat different footing from the training of disabled men. In the latter case the State deems that it owes, a duty to the man to provide him with the means of regaining the highest measure of industrial capacity that his disablement allows, if either he is incapable of resuming his former employment, or he would be at a serious disadvantage in pursuing it. In the case of the widow the State is not replacing an earning capacity which has been lost in its service, but offers to assist the widow to add to her income where her domestic needs make a remunerative occupation desirable in her own interest or in that of her children.Hence the Instructions require it to be shown that the I training is really called for by the widow&apos;s circumstances (Instruction 4 (a)). . Hence also the maintenance allowance provided for in Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant is fixed it a maximum of 12s. 6d. per week, the intention being to crovide by this allowance only such amount as is neces-ary to make up the widow&apos;s pension and other means [o the amount which will adequately provide for the aoman herself and her children during her training, it should not, therefore, be assumed that the allowance, rfiere granted, will always be at the rate of 12s. Gd. per reek, or that any allowance at all will necessarily be given. !t is not the Minister&apos;s intention to take a narrow view n dealing with applications, but it is important to avoid x   (37)4108   Wt 470 G 27   100   10/17   E &amp; S
misunderstanding that Local Committees should remember the difference in character between the allowance provided under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant in the case of dis-abled men under training and that provided by Article 14 and these Instructions.Conditions of Training.The Ministry does not at the present moment propose to indicate any particular occupations for^ which women could most suitably be trained. This \ matter is being carefully studied by the Minister, and a further note will be circulated to Local Committees as soon as possible.Meantime it is desired to draw attention to the points on which, whatever the training desired by an applicant, the Local Committee should definitely satisfy themselves. They are the following : (1) Whether the person whom it is desired to train is physically fitted and suited by education and general intelligence to undergo the desired course of instruction and the work which the subsequent pursuit of her occupation would involve. Wherever it is possible, certificates of this should be obtained from the woman&apos;s doctor and the institution at which it is pro-posed that she should be trained. .(2) Whether, in cases where there are children, satis-factory arrangements can be made for their custody during their mother&apos;s training, and, if so, whether there is reason to believe that afterwards the duties entailed by her occupa-tion will not materially interfere with the still more important duties of her home. It will, generally speaking, be undesirable for training to be given in cases where there are several children or they are of tender years, unless there are special circumstances which warrant it.Where it is necessary for the mother to, live away from home while receiving instruction, the child or children should be put under the tute-lage of some person interested in the family&apos;s welfare, preferably a near relation, and, where this cannot be done, it may be possible in some cases to take advantage of the assistance
afforded, by benevolent organisations con-nected with the occupation to which the deceased father belonged; for example, a police orphanage, in the case of a man who was a policeman before serving with the colours.(3) Whether the institution selected for training is adequately equipped to afford satisfactory results. If training is to be given in nursing, the local Medical Officer of Health should be consulted. Where there is a Central Body this can be easily ascertained by finding out whether the institution is one approved of by it, e.g., in the case of Midwifery, the Central Midwives Board, or, in the case of Massage, the Incorporated Society of Masseuses, should be consulted. In other cases the opinion of the Local Education Authority should be asked.(4) Whether the occupation in which training is to be given affords the widow a reasonable prospect of permanent and remunerative employment. At this juncture, not only the present state of employment of the occupation in question should be considered, but also the conditions which are likely to obtain in it after the war. For instance, while at the present time there is a great demand for shorthand typists, it is probable that, when the staffs of the large temporary Government Offices and of the many private businesses which have taken on fresh employees are disbanded, there will be a glut of shorthand typists on the labour market. The Ministry are advised that in this and similar occupations, where there is likely to be. a surplus of labour after the war, training should be restricted to persons who have fol-lowed these callings before marriage and only require a short course of instruction in them in order to regain their proficiency. Hence, in view of the severity of competition in women&apos;s employment after the war, more regard should be paid to the thoroughness of the training given in individual cases than to the number of persons trained.
Period of Training. SArticle 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant contemplates a normal period of three months&apos; training. This will be the proper period : (1) where the applicant wishes to resume the occu-pation in which she was employed before mar-riage;(2) where instruction is sought in less highly skilled occupations, such as that of a machinist or of French polishing, in which there is a good opening for women and in which progress sufficient to secure a fair living wage can be made in three months.There will, however, be occupations of - a more skilled or semi-professional character, such as, Midwifery or that of Secondary School Teacher, where a longer period of training is essential to adequate training. The Ministry is prepared to sanction courses of training for morel extended periods than three months where the casej justifies it.instructions for the training of widows.Under Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council of 29th March 1917.1. The following Instructions prescribe the conditions] under which training may be provided for widows and allowances paid under Article 14 of the Royal Warrantl and Order in Council of 29th March 1917.

Any widow who has been awarded and is in receip of a pension under either Article 11 or Article 13 of th(j Royal Warrant and Order in Council may be granted training at the expense of the Ministry.A widow whose pension has lapsed or has beei suspended shall cease to be eligible for training, provid

A course of training will not be sanctioned in the case of a widow with a young child or children under 16 years of age unless the Minister is satisfied&apos; that jadequate provision will be made for the care of her jchildren during her training; and if the course of training lobliges the widow to live away from home and from her thtfchild or children the Local Committee shall further under-ntejtake that the children shall be visited at least once a nonth either by a member or by an officer of any suitable )rganisation in order to ascertain that they are being uitably eared for.fjmt any course of training already commenced shall not be discontinued on account of such lapse or suspension.Procedure.3.

The Application shall be made on the prescribed form, and the Local Committee shall furnish such further information as is necessary to enable the Minister of Pensions to determine the application.4. A course of training for a widow will no  be sanctioned unless the Minister is satisfied : (a) that training is needed in the applicants interest,regard being had to any pension to which she is entitled and to her domestic circumstances;(b) that the applicant is suited to the occupation forwhich training is proposed to be given, regard being had to her age, her previous education, and occupation, if any, and for this purpose a statement from the instructor or other person connected with the occupation for which training is proposed to be given and competent to judge of the matter shall ordinarily be obtained by the Local Committee;(c) that there is a reasonable likelihood of the applicantbeing able to gain a permanent livelihood or substantially to augment her means of living by means of the training provided.

ORGANIZATION BRANCHExtracts from Reports of Inspectors forweek ended 3rd October, 1917.INVERNESS COUNTY LOCAL COMMITTEE.Since the last visit of the Inspector on 24th May the work of this Committee, more particularly in connection with discharged disabled soldiers, has very much increased. The accommodation is poor and arrangements are being made for improving this. An adjustment in the staffing arrange-ments will be necessary owing to the calling up of a member of the Gommittee who was in charge of the Local Oommitteers work.In view of the scattered population of the County and the difficulties of travelling, particularly amongst the islands, the Inspector has recommended that a visitor or correspondent should be appointed in every parish so that the Looal Committee would be in a position to obtain direct information in cases requiring urgent attention.The opportunities for training and employment of discharged men in Inverness are limited and no real progress can be made until the North of Scotland Agricultural College is available for training in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, etc., in which so large a number of men in the Highlands could be suitably employed.   Remunerative employment might also be obtained in stone-breaking and road repairing for whioh there is a large demand for labour.   Arrangements for training and after employment might be made with employers in Inverness in the Engineering, Cabinet-making and Upholstery trades and also with the Highland Railway workshops.INVERNESS LOCAL COMMITTED.The work of this Committee continues satisfactory and calls for no special remark.   Allowances and grants are carefully administered and the accounts are neatly kept. Adequate steps are taken to recover advances.LINLITHGOW LOCAL COMMITTEE.Whitburn Sub-Committee.No payments are being made by this Committee.   The Clerk complained that the Looal Committee would not give him any funds out of whioh to make any allowances or grants.   The root of the trouble is the lack of proper organisation on the part of the Local Committee,A copy of this report is being forwarded to the Local Committee for their remarks.
ISi EDINBURGH LOCAL COMMITTEE -There is nothing of special interest to report in the work of this Committee except that the Disablements Accounts are not oomplete,LANCASHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE. Chorley Sub-Committee.The work in this district is reported to be well organised though the payments are small.   There are Sub-Committees for several divisions and the whole area is covered so that in no oase has an applicant to go far to find a Committee.   The work was taken over on the 1st May last and is now proceeding satisfactorily.   Supplementary Allowances do not exoeed  10 a month,Preston Rural Sub-Committee.A large area is covered ey this Committee but as Preston is itself a natural oentre it is not difficult to work. Case papers examined show that the payments are oorrectly made. The Secretaries were very glad to have an opportunity of discussing their difficulties.LEIOfl LOCAL COMMITTEE.A big reduction has taken place in the expenditure of this Committee sinoe the previous visit of the Inspector and the revision required.    Total grants for the March Quarter amounted to  1^04 and for the June Quarter to  591.    There are still a large number of cases receiving grants but these on examination proved to be in order.Little appears to have been spent on disohargedmen but the Secretary assured the Inspeotor that they were not neglected.   They almost invariably found work with their old employers and did not require assistance.The Committee is represented on the Lancashire Joint Committee and is prepared to deal with any likely cases for training or treatment.The weekly payments out of the looal voluntary fund exoeed the amount paid from Statutory Funds.ST.HELENS LOCAL COMMITTEE.Notwithstanding the letters from the Statutory Committee to this Looal Committee there is still little improvement in daaling with oases under Regulation 13(e). The proportion of those refused is perhaps greater than those accepted but the Inspeotor doubts if the great majority of the grants are warranted.   The grant is invariably made  3 under this Regulation,   A fair number of grants under other Regulations were examined and found to be in order.WIMES LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work continues to be satisfactorily done by
this Committee and grants are carefully made!Although there has been little expenditure upon disabled men. a great amount of time has been spent upon these oases and the Committee is quite $live to their needs.     Employment Is good and the men themselves have found work in the great majority of oases.     Case papers are well kept and information is readily available.KILKENNY LOCAL COMMIT.[EE.This Committee only started work on the let August.     There have not ^*tn many transactions up to the present.     The Secretary appointed in the first instance has resigned.     A new Secretary has been appointed, but is as yet not familiar with the work.     The amount advanced by the Statutory Committee was  50.COUNTY MONAGHAN LOCAL COMMITTEE.The accounts of this aommittee are well kept and fully written up to date.     There are five distributors in the County to whom money is supplied.LINDSEY LOOAL COMMITTEE,, This district Is wholly Industrial and mainly engineering, while the rSral area is wholly agricultural. The Offioes are oentrally placed and applicants are evidently treated Intelligently and sympathetically.     The accounts are well kept and the work is generally well done.     There is one defect and that is that the Committee make a practice of giving grants in kind by notes on grocers and other tradesmen.     The Inspector pointed out that the Ministry could not approve this system and it will he discontinued,-SPENBOROUGH LOCAL OQMFJTTBE.,Infringements of the Regulations discovered by the Inspector, about which the Committee is being written to.The Committee are paying grants under Regulation 13(a) which are not justified and object to altering their procedure.
APPENDIX XXIV.stateinentof matters affecting post war problems dealt with By&quot;the Minis try &quot;&quot;&quot;of&quot; Pensions alone-., or in .,co-bperation&quot;&quot;with dthernDe&apos;j5a&quot;rtmenta *The enquiries made by Dr. Addison in his letter of the 18th August to Mr. Barnes, are somewhat difficult to answer. The Ministry have always been fully alive to the necessity of making their work truly reconstructive and have not been satisfied with the mere payment of pensions, and have throughout aimed at replacing disabled officers and men in industry and as . far as possible training widows of deceased officers and men to take a place as wage earners.     Dr. Addison is anxious to be assured that there is no duplication but a real co-operation with the different Government Departments dealing with different aspects of after-war problems.The Ministry have been in very close communication with the different Government Departments who could assist them with regard to disabled men.1.        The first specific cpuestion asked by Dr. Addison is that with regard to any Committees appointed by the Department. Locally there have been established over 300 Committees fr-r^d by the Local Authorities and consisting of representative elements.     TThesQ Local Committees have teen instructed to co-operate with Public Health Committees, National Health Insuranc Committees, Agricultural Committees, and the Employment Exchanges of the Labour Ministry in their areas.     In addition to these Local Committees, the Ministry have established stfne 20 Joint Committees, specially dealing with the Treatment and Training of disabled men.     These Joint Committees are instructed to review the hospital and other Institutional accommodation available for the treatment of Sailors and Soldiers, and recommend its extension where necessary and also in co-operation with County Directors of Eduoation, Agricultural Committees etc to form schemes of training which can he- put into operation in their area&apos;.   - It was felt that the area of a Borough or County was not sufficiently large to enable sufficient variety of schemes to be initiated, and that to avoid overlapping, the Joint Committees   should concentrate particulars of Treatment and Training in different parts of their district.At the Central Offices of the Ministry there is an Institutional Committee presided over by gir Arthur Boscawen, Parliamentary Secretary, and containing representatives of the War Offiae and the Red Cross, with certain representatives Of the Medical Profession, within whose reference it is to provide institutions for the treatment of certain special classes of disabled men, and where necessary to combine this treatment with preliminary training in industry.     A similar Institutional Committee has been established under the same Chairmanship ftr Scotland, both Committees hitherto operating with Red Cross ) Funds.The Ministry is also arranging with the War Office to co-operate in the provision of Curative Manual Training in military and auxiliary hospitals.With regard to officers, a small Committee has just been appointed to advise the Secretary on schemes for Treatment and Tralndjig,     This C-ommittee includes representatives of Technical Education-^and of the Medical Profession.
2.        With &quot;regard to Dr. Addis-on&apos;s second. que-stion, the Department is -not,&apos; repreeerrted officially on other than Departmental- Committees, except in so far that a re pre sentative has been appointed to. a-,War Office Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee on -Officers&apos; employment which has not met since the appointment.3.        Enquiries affecting post-war problems are being conducted with the help of representatives of other Departments and the following paragraphs show generally the extent of co-operation withthosmDepartments.(1) There has been since the days of the Statutory Committee, exceedingly close co-operation with the Labour Ministry, especially the Employment Section, previously under the Board of Trade.     Two representatives of the Ministry form a small informal committee with two of the Labour Ministry. That Department^ in co-operation &quot;with the Statutory Committee and now with the Pensions Ministry, have made arrangements for the establishment of Trade Advisory Committees and for enquiries into the different forms of employment which would be suitable for the training of disabled men and which would give fair prospects of remunerative employment.     These Committees are being set up in 13 trades and consist of representatives of Employers and Workmen to consider questions of training and apprentice ship.     Reports have been or are on the point of being issued with reference to the following employmentsI) Tailoringii)       Agricultural Motor Tractor work(iii) Cinematograph operations.(iv) Electrical sub-stations.(v) Boot and Shoe making and repairing.(vi) Leather Work.(vii) Furniture Trades.(viii) Gold, silver and Jewellery,(ix) Plumbing *(x) Painting,Further the; Statutory &quot;Committee had arranged with the Labour Ministry for the formation, where necessary, of Advisory Wages Boards, consisting of an equal number of representatives of workmens&apos; organisations and employers&apos; associations, on which members of the Local Committee should sit as assessors in order that any disputes as to the amount of wage which could be earned by a disabled man should, If possible, be -settled,     Panels have been prepared in the 20 largest to^ns in the United Kingdom.As has been mentioned above, Local Committees co-operate closely with the National Employment Exchanges.     All Sailors and Soldiers are referred to the Exchanges on discharge, and the Exchanges report to the Local Committees, cases   in, which they are unable to ?ind work for discharged men within a fortnight of the date of registration.     At present the obtain^ ing employment fcr disabled men capable of work presents no very serious difficulties, but it is recognised that these will arise when great numbers of discharged men not disabled are seeking work and the need for the closest collaboration between the Labour and Pension Ministries is obvious.     This holds also as regards the employment of disabled officers, though schemes for this will probably have to be centrally administered without the intervention of the Employment Exchanges and LocalCommittees
Committees,(2) With the Board of Education there has been constajrt. communication.     The Board have assisted by advising as to schemes of Training as to suitable Technical Institutions,       ^ and there is a liason officer appointed by the Board of Education.It has been necessary to arrange with the Board of Education as to how far the Ministry should bear the cost of the training of disabled men.     Many of these men have been soldiers only for a few months, and when they cease to be soldiers have just as much right as other civilians, to the benefits of the Education Acts.     The Statutory Committee attempted to arrange through the Board of Education that disabled men should be admitted to all existing classes cn payment of the fee charged to ordinary civilians, but had to guarantee that expenses&quot;of any extra classes formed should be covered by special fees paid by them on the men&apos;s behalf.     There has been some controversy with the Local Authorities in Technical Institutions over the amount of these fees.     Local Authorities are always anxious to claim a large share of their expenditure, from the Exchequer and diminish the charge on&apos; the rates.(3) The Board of Agriculture have appointed a liason officer and besides co-operating as to the admission of disabled men to the Agricultural Training in the Colleges throughout the country, advise upon any schemes of Training in Farms, etc.     As is no doubt known to Dr. Addison, there are 3 land settlement schemes now in contemplation by the Board of Agriculture.     An informal agreement has been arrived at by which a percentage of disabled men can be Included in any Farm Colonies to be established.     A few disabled men who have been through Training Colleges have already been taken at the Sunk Island Settlement,-Both the Board of Agriculture and the Pensions Ministry have . grants available- for men in Farm Colonies and an adjustment is needed between the two departments.The Ministry is likely to have applications for Capital sums&quot;to enable men to take up small holdings.     It would be an advantage if any proposals are being made for the establishment of Agricultural Banks, that questions of loans to-disabled men should receive consideration in drafting any scheme.(4) The Local Government Board are responsible at present for the control of the Public Health Authorities,    5heir officers have givenjsreat assistance to the Ministry in regard to Institutions for,un-insured persons and in other ways*There are several tb$*3a3l questions of administration which will need adjustment, the principal of which is the question of hospitals.     Even before the war, there was an extension of State and Municipal provision for Institutional Treatment,     School clinics were being established by Local Authorities, under the pressure of the Board of Education, and for some time past certain forms of disease have been dealt with publicly, e,g. in fever hospitals or tuberculosis Wnatoria The general system of civil medical institutional treatment, remains, however, in voluntary hands.     The governing bodiesmore the consulting surgeons and physicians of the great Civil Hospitals have been very much averse to State aid with its corollary of State interference.     Since the war, theestablishment
establishment of the Army Medical system, the commandeering of wings of the general hospitals, and the activiti&amp;s of the Red Cross have revolutionized medical arrangements.     Hospitals now insist on a payment for the maintenance of each soldier.     A few like St. Bartholomew&apos;s still held out at the beginning of the war, and declared themselves willing to take in everyone free.     Latterly there has been a demand for payment not only for maintenance, but also for medical services.     This demand has been pressed by the British Medical Association, but is still opposed by leading members of the medical profession who prefer a system under which consultants can give their servioes free to hospitals, an arrangement which has resulted in hospitals obtaining the very best consultant advice, which they could not obtain except at enormous c at, while the leading private practitioners have kept themselves thoroughly up to date by their contact with the large hospitals.The Ministry have found that the prejudice against the non-voluntary hospitals, namely, those under the control of the Poor Law, is as strong as ever.     There has been a great outcry that ex-soldiers have been found in the Infirmaries, though In many counties, Infirmaries are well equipped and staffed and exceedingly comfortable.     Strong expressions of feeling have also been evoked by the admission of ex-soldiers to the ordinary asylums.     This has been onl;y partially appeased by m. scheme that has been worked out with the help of the Board of Control by which the Ministry pays the usual cost of maintenance and certain special fees to enable these men to be given some small privileges and to be called Service Patients.It is clear that there must be very careful enquiry and revision- of all the medical arrangements.     If In future the State are to undertake Medical Service, the objection at the present Medical Service of the Poor La?? must be borne in mind.     If the State subsidises voluntary institutions, It is inevitable that some rorm of control must follow.     Great pressure is being brought to bear upon the Ministry for greater subsidies for Medical S^vice.The Local Government Board are also the authority for relief of destitution.     It is, of course, obvious that every new form of public assistance tends to overlap with the Poor Law Administration.     Pensions to widows and to disabled men, grants for the education of children of ex-soldiers, all reduce the possibilities of destitution.     The creation of the 300 new committees who are spending directly at the rate of one million and a quarter a year without any reference to the Poor Law Authorities is a matter to which the attention of the Government will no doubt be directed, with a view to a re-construction of the whole system of public assistance.(5) The National Health Insurance Commissioners are responsible for the treatment, through their panel doctors, of well over 90 per cent of discharged soldiers.     At the same time the Ministry are responsible.     The Statutory Committee had hoped to arrange through the Commissloners for a system of specialist medical treatment beyond the ordinary panel doctor system.     &quot;The Ministry have been obliged to set up a system of medical referees of their own, but it is clear that in this direction and also in the treatment of Tuberculosis, consideration of the whole question of administration is needed.     In Tuberculosis cases, while the Commissioners, through their Local Committees, arrange for dispensary treatment and for sanatoria treatment, generally for not more than three months^ the Ministry is establishing certain Institutions *cr advanced cases of Tuberculosis

In Tuberculosis cases, 3?hile the Commissioners, through their Local Committees, arrange for dispensary treatment and for sanatoria treatment, generally for not more than three monthsx the Ministry is establishing certain Institutions *cr advanced cases of Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis which are not being dealt with under the Commissioners.(6) It is obvious that the connection of the Ministry with the War Office and the Admiralty must be exceedingly close. Through the Special Grants Committee, the Ministry determine certain questions of fact with regard tovSeparation Allowances. Through the Local Committees the Ministry supplements Separation Allowances where the War Office and Admiralty flat rate leave oases of hardship,     There is also the question of the adjustment of Service Pensions and Disability Pensions;   and constant references with regard tc the services of officers retired for disability, whose papers are not. as are those of men, transferred to the Ministry when they leave the Service.     But most of these points of contact Rill disappear or become infrequent when demobilisation has been completed&apos;and till then any changes in &apos;&apos; the present system must be made in consultation with the Departments concerned as the necessity for them becomes apparent.With regard to the medical requirements of the Pensions Ministry, it Is necessary tp look ahead.     In the first instance the War Office having taken for the Army large numbers of the Civil Medical Profession,the constantly growing work of assessment of pensions for the Ministry cannot at present be done without their help.     It is now performed  y medical officers in military employ under the direction of the medical branch of the War Office.     It is, however, in contemplation to transfer the staff and the work to the Ministry of Pensions, and a start is being made in this direction by the establishment of civilian /ledical Boards for the assessment of pensions etc. in cases of neurasthenia, which form an appreciable proportion of those that have to be dealt with.     The further transfer of the staff and work will follow gradually.In the second place the absorption of Civil Hospital accommodation and staff by the War Offioe require the treatment of many mtegories of discharged men in Military Hospitals.     If none of these were continued after the war new provision would have to be made for the surplus - very considerable at first and lessening as the years go on - of men requiring hospital treatment over the normal requirements of the male civil population in this respect.     Whether military hospitals will continue to be kept up by the War Office in excess of Army requirements to meet the needs of discharged disabled men, or whether the Ministry of Pensions should set up further medical administrative maohinery to deal with this diminishing demand for treatment, or whether it should be the charge of some existing or new Public Health Depart-ment having a strong medical administrative staff, seems a matter requiring early decision, especially In view of the iLarge questions of medical administrative policy that the treatment vbf discharged disabled men in voluntary and rate supported institutions are raising.     The views of the demobilization branch of the War Offioe have been promised with regard to it.
APPENDIX  XXV. MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.Preliminary Report on British and Foreign Press, i - -   ..... &quot;    .........Allies&apos; Legislation and Orders as to Pensions ,and Allowances^Tho Times (21st September, 1917) V7ashington correspondent summarizes the Soldiers Insurance Bill now before the Legislature.   It provides, he says, compensation for disability or death on service by way of Insurance In liou of pension, the Government acting as Insurer.   The compensation for total disability ranges from  8 to  20 a month and for death up to  2,000, the amount varying with the number of children.   The scheme also provides, he says &quot;completely&quot; for the re-education and rehabitation of injured men, but in what way Is not stated. The Lancet (22nd September, 1917) sets out very fully the benefits secured by the Royal Warrant of July 1917 to medical men and thoir families on the death or disablement of the former while on service.Enemies&apos; Legislation and Orders as to Pensions and AllowancesThe Soziale Praxis (2nd May, 1917) says the town of Elberficld following the example of most of the large towns in Germany is attempting to supplement out of war charity funds the Government pensions now given to the widows and orphans of deceased soldiers, on the ground that at the present high cost of living th*y   fere not sufficient to provide the barest necessities of life.   They hope that later the Government will deal with the matter systematically and suitably.   In the meantime the town in question proposes to make up the Government pension to a minimum which shall not be less than the amount which the family would have received if the soldier were still alive.   The following are the rates fixed:-For
For 1 personFor q widow with 1 child.,,       *,   2 childrenMk. 900 por annumt * $ * i i     ^ * ** * ft ft     ^ * *1,080 1,260 1,440 ,, 1,620 ,, 1,800 ,,&quot;This minimum income shall he further extended in the case of families with a number of children and for the training of specially gifted children for a calling&quot;.   Assistance shall also be given, so far as the means available permit, to make it possible for tho children to receive an education corresponding to the intentions of the dead father or to continue a course cf study already commenced. The Korrospondenz b j,att der General kommission der Geworkschafton Dontschlands. (The official organ of tho German Trade Unions) in its issue of 2nd June 1917 describes the system lately adopted in Germany to enable tho State to .keep a record of the cause of a disabled soldier**s loss of earning capacity.   Thus, it distinguishes between Disablement due to service generally. (pienstbesehadigung) and Disablement due to active service (Kriondienstbeschadigung)-, the main idea being that if the disablement is caused by self-mutilation to escape further service or to circumstances for which the soldier or a comrade is to blame, he is not to be entitled to any State compensation.   The Company Officer, the Battalion Doctor and the Battalion Commander are in the first instance to make tho classification and in practice it is generally made by the draft Battalion to which the wounded man is sent after treatment is concluded. Injuries caused by buryings by the explosion of mines or shells, gas poisoning, accidents caused by falls into shell-holes trenuheo,. and the like and by lifting heavy weights, arc all classed as Kriegsdienstbsschadigungwithout
1 Q 4JL u   jfcwithout much question.   The particulars of the returns required are here given.The;Anstellungs Naehrichten (official organ of the Prussian War Ministry f or--4iaable&amp;jswldlers) of 27th August 1917 gives the regulations for the concession of revocable grants to dependants of fallon soldiers.   They are to be made on the basis of the earned income of the dead man and to his widow or lawful children only, and only apply to those of the lower ranks who have been killed or died of wounds or other injuries contracted during military service provided these dependants are entitled to statutory war relief (gezetzliche Kriogsversorgung). Tho receipt of the earned income must be proved, the grant to the widow is in no case to be more than will bring her yearly income up to Mk.3,000. and in calculating the income free lighting, housing and similar benefits are to be taken into consideration as well as commissions and bonuses, but not gratuities.   All sums arising from Insurances of any kind are to be deducted, and in the case of an annual earned income of less than Ilk. 1,500 no grant will be made.   The following is the schedule of grants:-The amount of tho grant is:-Hi/here the yearly earned	For	the widow of	aincome of the dead was:-				Sergeant Major.	Sergeant *	Private.			Mk. 1500-1600	Mk.

Forms for the claim for such grants are appended to tho s cheme. ,Treatment of the Disabled.  ,The British Medical Journal (22nd September, 1917) contains a letter from Dr. Braekenbury (Chairman of the B.M.A. Insurance Act Committee) explaining the arrangement lately made with panel doctors for their attendance on disabled service men.   This follows on much correspondence on the subject and will he repeated in the Committee^ quarterly circular.   In the same paper (29th September) Dr. A.S.Downton proposes that instead of the proposed capitation fee of 9/- the doctor should receive one of 12/6 exclusive of drugs.The Morning Post (22nd September, 1917) and other morning papers contain a letter from Sir Frederick Milner defending the Recuperation Hostels as superior to the Homos of Recovery The same paper summarizes the plans of the British Home-steads Association (I,Irs.01iphant Murray and Sir Frederick Milner Presidents) which proposes to take up disabled men where the Red Cross leaves them, and to provide Convalescent Homes.   The first Home opened is at Congleton.- -An option has been obtained for 1,000 acres of farm land within 23 miles of London and an appeal is made by Arnold Bennett and others for 1,000 ladies to give  50 a piece for its utilization.The Revue Scientifique (10-17th February,1917) has an article by Dr. Maragc on Hles Surdites de Guerre&quot; in which after describing tho diagnosis of the different forms of war-deafness and the instruments employed in it, he gives a summary of their treatment by (1)   rest in the country,(2)   exercises in listening to the natural voice,(5)        tt 9t       ft    ,, a special syrongiving out vowel sounds,He
He gives the result of the treatment at Bourges of a number of cases by these means which led to the restoration to activo service of 46% and to auxiliary service of another 30$. He is opposed to lip-reading which he thinks a hindrance to cure, though of service to tho incurably deaf. In the same paper of the 28th April - 8th May, 1917 M.Edward Drouot (Professor at the College des Sourds-Muets) defends the system of lip-reading and thinks it the only sound way of treating cases of war-deafness. Even when the deafness Is only partial or temporary he says it can do no harm, thereby differing from Dr.Marage.^ Paris Medical (17th April 1917,) contains an article hj M Emile Sergent on the medical classification current In the French Army of certain persons as &quot;suspects de tuborculose&quot;.   He says that he has examined numbers of such cases and has generally found that they have either not been attacked by tuberculosis or that the lesions of the lungs &quot; have cicatrized or have ceased to become infectious.   He urges that all who produce Bacilli in the sputa should be sent to a hospital where they can be examined by radioscopy and the reaction to inoculation.In the Archives,Hedicales Beiges of June 1917, Dr. Baruch declares that the proximate cause of shell-shock is to be found in the displacement of the medulla oblongata which according to him leads to a diminution in the quantity of carbonic acid gas expelled and thereby paralyses the heart. He gives some experiments on frogs in proof of his theory. Training of the Disabled.In the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (July,1917) Dr. Edgar E.Cyriax explains with illustrations the normal movements of the scapula during abduction and adduction of the shoulder joint, on which his researches have led him to a different conclusion from that of most anatomical text-books.   He also gives particulars of the muscles used in themotions
motions of the elbow, wrist and anklo joints as of importance in the training of those injured in the arms and legs.   He differs from the text-books also as to the notation of the lumbar vertebrae in certain movements and gives a method for its demonstration.In the Archives of Radiology (August,1917) Major J.Hall-Edwards, R.A.H.C. describes 3 machines invented by him for exercising the wrist and elbow in pronaticn and supination and for the treatment of foot-drop.   The new feature about them all is that they provide for tho measurement of the amount of movement effected by means of a dial, visible to the patient.   He finds that these interest him in his cure and relieve the monotony of tho treatment.   The article is Illustrated. Employment of thq Disabled.The Times (25th September, 1917) has an appeal by Sir Clifford Allbutt as President of the Cambridgeshire After Care Association for funds for equipping Papworth Hall and 50 acres of freehold lately bought by the Association as a home for 50 patients.   He gives an account of Dr. Varrier Jones1 work at the Associations Bourn Colony since the war where tuberculous anddisabled soldiers are taught carpentry, gardening, poultry-keeping, electrical fillings work and tailoring.   The Glebe of the 29th September reports that Sir Ernest Cassel has sent  5.000 towards thisobject.The Times of the 25th September also publishes an interview with Mr.Bernard Oppenheimer on diamond-cutting as an   emplcy-ment for soldiers who have lost one or both legs.   He says his firm will employ from 350 to 500 men and that when their training is finished they are free to seek employment elsewhere.He welcomes competition.
The Revue Sclentlfique(31st March 7th Aprils 1917) has a note by P.R. on home work in France for the mutilated. Basket work mat-making,.he says take the first place but in several places on th  Loire riband weaving in carried on at home and is easily mastered.   Toymaking is also a home industry lately rising in favour under the Carnot Foundation.   In the French Jura watch making is also practised.   Tailoring, boot*-making and above all artistic work are also recommended by him.The Korresyondenzblatt.quoted above in it3 issue of May 26th discusses a proposal lately made at Eftscn for establising a separate organization or Union c-f Economic Association for disabled soldiers.   The Trade Unions, of which the journal Is the organ, contend that there is no need for such an organization and that by their co-opera-tion with the employers1 associations, they have themselves in many cases secured the reinstatement of disabled soldiers.   It asks those disabled on service to rely on the trade unions to which they formerly belonged and says that they arc ready and willing to assist them in every way. Miscellaneous.The Times and other papers publish the official statement of the Committee respecting tho strike at tho Lord Robert&apos;s Memorial Homes.   It says that of the 250 men out, only 6 who have boon employed for more than 3 months are still earning only  1 weekly.   54 men earn from.  5/- to 30/- and 30 more than 30/-.   The remainder earn 22/6.   It also declares that the 25/- per weok demanded by the strikers oould not be paid without insolvency, that the profit made last year was only  960, and that this was applied towards establishing a home for massage
The Pall Mall Gazette (28th September, 1917) and other papers report that the Lambeth Board of Guardians have resolved not to notify the Army Council of the admission of dependants of soldiers in service to any rate-aided institutions for medical treatment, as if they do, the dependants&apos; allowances are at once stopped. In the Evening Standard (21st September, 1917) is a leader on Kr,Mawson&apos;s book &quot;an imperial Obligation&quot; which advocates villages for disabled soldiers.   The book has also boen favourably reviewed in most of the other daily papers, While agreeing with the scheme in principle, the Standard points out that Such villages must be self governing and tho only way to make them a sue&amp;oss would be for disabled officers of rank to live in thorn and toko a share in their govornment.The Weekly Despatch (23rd September, 1917) has an article by Max Pemberton describing a visit to the Golders Green Home of Recovery for Shcll-Shock and other cases.3rd October, 1917,F,L.

There be no doubt that the title &quot;Ministry of ensions &quot;expresses very inadequately the duties nd functions of the office.  A pension is simply money compensation (so far as there can be aoney compensation) given to the disabled man or the bodily hurt which has been inflicted upon m in the service of the State.   But even to the ost casual observer it must be obvious that a eat deal more than this is required.  We owe a uch larger debt to the discharged soldier or ailor broken in the defence of his country.  It our duty to put him back, to restore him in factto society healed and mended in body and mind so far as is possible, and to render him once again a. self-respecting and wealth producing member of the.community. In other words the after care of the soldier, his further medical or surgical treat-ment, his training in a new trade or &quot;re-educa-tion &quot; as the French call it, and the finding of permanent employment for him is more important th.an.mere pension. Mr. Barnes, our late Minister, whom we are all so sorry to lose, was never tired of insisting on this. It is gratifying to find that Mr. Hodge takes the same view.At the beginning of the war, and, in fact, down to quite a recent period, we failed to recognise this duty. The old plan of the War Office and Chelsea Hospital had been to award or refuse a pension to the man as the case might be and.to turn him adrift. We were in fact far behind our Allies, the French and the Belgians. Voluntary Societies, notably the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society, did something, and, as usual in this country, pointed out its duty to the. State. The first official recognition of &quot; after care &quot; appears in the Act passed two years ago which established the Statutory Committee, to which body was entrusted this most important duty. But the Statutory Committee had been able to accomplish little practical work in this direction before it. was placed under the control of the Ministry of Pen-sions: From the moment that he entered upon office Mr. Barnes took up the matter with vigour and made the policy peculiarly his own.Under the new Warrant generous terms were given to men undergoing treatment and training the whole cost of which was thrown on &quot;the State. The duty of carrying out this policy was entrusted to the Local Committees, and in order that the fullest possible advantage should be taken of existing facilities,&apos;&apos; Joint Co mmittees -&quot; operating Over large areas were formed so that the facilities could be pooled, and officers called &quot; Bepresenta-tives of the Ministry&quot; were appointed for the express purpose of assisting Local and Joint
Committees in the work. In - some respects, however, we found ourselves deficient in the requisite facilities, especially in those for the institutional treatment of certain diseases from which a large number of discharged men suffer. To meet this difficulty Mr. Barnes established Joint Institutional Committees in England and Scotland, and took advantage of the generous offers of the Eed Cross Society and of other voluntary contributors to supply the initial cost of such institutions, the maintenance being pro-vided by the State. These two Committees ,are busily at work in providing additional places for neurasthenic and epileptic cases in both countries, also for paraplegics and advanced tubercular cases in England ; while in Scotland large extra pro-vision is being, made for giving orthopaedic treat-ment to discharged men. The poor fellows suffer-ing from neurasthenia or &quot; shell shock &quot; had been terribly neglected. It is hoped that there will be ample provision shortly.Nor has the training side been forgotten. Much is being accomplished for limbless men at places like the Regent Street Polytechnic under the capable guidance of Major Mitchell, our Adviser on Training. &quot;Already four hundred maimed men have passed through the Polytechnic, and have been placed in good employment at high wages. All over the country Local and Joint Committees are putting forward schemes for training those who cannot resume their old occupations. Private benevolence is helping now, too. Only last Saturday I had the pleasure of formally opening on behalf of the Minister the Cowen Training Home at Newcastle-on-Tyne, founded by Miss Cowen in memory of her father and mother, where between forty and fifty wounded soldiers are being housed and are learning new trades. Miss Cowen proposes to enlarge the home and to extend its sphere of usefulness.But if much is being done, very much more remains to be done. The public, which is splen-didly sympathetic with the disabled soldier, has got to learn in what way its sympathy can be utilised to the greatest advantage. A very great deal will depend on the work and the attitude of Local Committees. In the course of visits to many of them in the country I have been greatly struck with the excellence of the work in most places. There are some Committees, however, who do not seem to realise their duties sufficiently. They lose touch, or sometimes never get into touch, with the disabled men, or content them-selves with ascertaining that they have gone back to work without inquiring what sort of work it is. This will not do. We do not want any kind of blind-alley occupation for the man, but something which will enable them to live in self-respect and to earn good money in addition to their pensions for the rest of their lives.   There is no reasonwhy our disabled heroes should not be better off after the war, notwithstanding the loss of a limb or some other serious disability than they were before. Local Committees must have the idea of &quot; restoration &quot; constantly before them both by means of treatment and training, and the Bepre-sentatives of the Ministry must give them all the help in their power in carrying out the work. I can say with confidence that the new Minister of Pensions, Mr. Hodge, will give them his most energetic support,fso that they may enable him to realise his ideal of a &quot; Ministry of Bestoration.&quot;ABTHUB GBIPPITH-BOSCAWEKTo assist them in avoiding any unnecessary delay, the Ministry desire to impress upon Local Com-mittees the importance of answering questions referred to them as soon as possible.Monthly Notes.&apos;   * -o-The name of Mr. B.

It is hoped that, when an exhaustive statement for any area has been compiled, it may be possible to give a block sanction, which will enable the necessary treatment to be pro-ceeded with at once, without the delay involved in obtaining Special Sanction.Parents&apos; Pensions.The Minister of Pensions announces that it has been decided to extend the provisions regulating the grant of pensions to the widows and other dependents of sailors and soldiers so that (a) The parent or parents of a man who has died as a result of the^present war may, if they are- or become wholly or partly incapable of self-support from infirmity or age and in pecuniary need, be granted a pension at such rate (not less than 3s. 6d. or more than 15s. a week) as the Minister may determine, notwith-standing that they were not dependent on the sailor or soldier before he joined for service.(6).The parent or parents of a man who has so died who may have been or may hereafter be pensioned under the provisions of the said Order in Council or Royal Warrant at a rate less than- 15s. a week may in . like circumstances be granted an increase of pension at such rate as the Minister may determine irrespective of the amount of their dependence on the sailor or soldier before he joined for service.(c) All pensions now current of a smaller amount than 3s. 6d. a week will be raised to that rate, and in future no pension to parents will be less than 3s. 6d. a week.Grants made under this concession will in no case have effect from a date earlier than September 1st.Applications for such pensions or increases of pensions should be addressed by the parent or parents to the Secretary, Ministry of Pensions, 45, Grosvenor Road, London, S.W. 1, and should be accompanied by a letter in support of the claim from- a member of a Local War Pensions Committee, a clergyman or doctor, etc., to whom the applicants&apos; circumstances are well known.Full particulars of the sailor or soldier, i.e., ship or regiment, rating or rank, official number or regimental number, and date of death, should be given in the application. Letters should be marked on the outside, &quot; Parents&apos; Special Pension.&quot;
National Health Insurance.-o-  -        fNational Health Insurance touches nearly every family, and in certain cases the benefits provided affect, or are affected by, the pension - or allowance of the Ministry of Pensions. A detailed explanation of the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts will be found in the pamphlet &quot; Information for Voluntary Workers, No.&apos; 1,&quot; published by the Joint Committee on Social Service, in these notes it is merely proposed to emphasize certain provisions which specially relate first to the discharged soldier and then to the dependants of those serving.When a man is discharged, transferred to reserve, or released to munitions, it is desirable for several reasons that his position in &apos;regard to Health Insurance should be established without delay. Unless he elected on joining up not to become an insured person, he should receive with his discharge papers a buff card, Army Form 0. 1845. Should he not have done so he must apply for it at once to the officer by whom he was last paid. If he is a member of an approved society 0. 1845 shoul d be compl eted and sent to the secretary of his society. At the same time he will receive from the Ministry of Pensions a medical card entitling him to receive medical benefit from a panel doctor. The medical card should be taken immediately to the doctor he has chosen. His sickness benefit, however, may be affected by the rate of pension awarded him. If he has been granted a pension or gratuity in respect of 100 per cent, disable-ment (not less than 27s. 6d. weekly, or  30 lump sum), his rate of sickness benefit will be reduced by 5s., until 26 contributions have again been paid in respect of insurable employment; nor will he be entitled to any disablement benefit until 104 contributions have been similarly paid. Pensions in respect of a lower degree of incapacity do not affect the rate of benefit, but it should be noted that though a discharged soldier may receive a pension for wounds, etc., whether he can work or not, he will only be entitled to sickness benefit if he be incapable of working.A discharged soldier who is not a member of an Ap-proved Society must send his Army Form 0. 1845 to the Insurance Commissioners, Maida Hill, London, W.9, and if he has been, discharged on account of wounds, sickness, or disease, he will be entitled to receive benefits ,from the Navy and Army Fund, but if he were discharged on account of some minor ailment he may be required to join an Approved Society. On being so notified by the Commission he should apply at once to a Society for membership, for otherwise, unless he was a Deposit Contribute r before enlistment, he will not be entitled, for a period of three months, to any benefit save Maternity Benefit for his wife..The benefits of the Navy and Army Fund are ad-ministered by the Local Insurance Committee, and any member of the Fund who does not receive a medical card within ten days after admission, should apply to the Clerk, quoting the membership number on his insurance book.The discharged soldier who has most difficulty in establishing his position is the man who, at some time previous to enlistment, has been an insured person, but has been careless as to how he disposed of his cards. Such a man will get medical benefit in any case on discharge, but as regards his other benefits his cise entails most patient and careful enquiry, for so long as there is any doubt as to whether he is a member of an Approved Society he cannot be made a member of the Navy and Army Fund. . An old insurance book or medical card, or even a panel doctor&apos;s name may give a clue and permit his establishment in full member-ship.The most important provision under HealthJnsurance for soldiers&apos; dependants is Maternity Benefit, and no difficulty should arise in obtaining it in,respect of the husband&apos;s insurance. It is not affected by arrears, nor by any question of paternity, and the wife is entitled to the full 30s. whether her husband is a member of an Approved Society or no. If he is, the application should be made to the secretary of his Society in the ordinary way. If he is not, the claim should be made to the Regimental Paymaster. (If he is in the Navy and is not a member of an Approved Society, the form must be obtained from the Accountant-General of the Navy, Admiralty, London, S.W.)All applications should be made a month before the expected date of the confinement.Maternity Benefit which is claimed in respect of the wife&apos;s own insurance may sometimes present more difficulty. A woman who was insured before marriage is suspended on ceasing to be employed, and will be asked to exercise her option as to whether she will remain in insurance as a Voluntary Contributor. If, however, she can satisfy her society that she has only ceased work on account of her condition, and that she will resume work as soon as she is capable, she need not be suspended and Maternity Benefit may be paid. The decision rests with the society, and in doubtful cases their practice has been to defer payment of benefit until employment is resumed. If the member does not intend to resume employment nor to become a Voluntary Contributor she is entitled to 5s. per week for four weeks during confinement until the sum remaining to her credit on suspension is exhausted.If the Society is satisfied with the evidence it may pay sickness benefit in respect of incapacity caused by pregnancy, but the member would, of course, be required to conform with the rules governing behaviour while in receipt of benefit.In regard to sickness benefit the only point of special reference is in relation to the grants of the Local Pensions Committee to dependants of soldiers on account of illness. Needless to say no application should be entertained in respect of a worker without full informa-tion as to title to sickness benefit under Health Insurance., N.A.G.H.
Local Committees at Work.-o--No. 6. The Borough of Swansea.- o s ^       --The County Borough of Swansea lies on both banks of the River Tawe and is the Welsh speaking metropolis of Wales. It has been termed the metallurgical centre of the world, and within its borders are carried on various metal industries. Here we find thousands of men engaged in the intricate processes of the manufacture of steel, copper, tinplate, lead, zinc, nickel, in fact in all the metal extraction branches upon which the successful prosecution of the war so much depends.The town is one of the natural outletsfor the exporta-tion of the anthracite coal hewed by the miners in the rich adjacent anthracite area, and in peace times its well equipped docks have resounded with the industry of thousands of dock workers engaged in the multifarious work of a busy seaport.The early stages of the war brought a tremendous number of enlistments from the borough and the surrounding areas, and the resources of the Local Branch of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Association were very quickly tested in taking over the administration of the payment of Supplementary Allowances, etc., to the dependants of the men with the Colours. This administration of the grants received from the National Relief Fund was based on award system, and formed the basis of that in operation at the present time.The transference of this particular branch of the work &apos; to the Swansea War Pensions Committee was effected cm the 1st July, 1916, and no interruption in the payment of the various supplemental grants occurred.The officers of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Association loyally rendered the Local Committee all the help in their power in the transference of duties, and the Lady Almoners and their Voluntary helpers, in response to the invitation of the Local Committee, readily consented to carry on their work&quot; as before the appointed day. vIt may be of interest here to outline briefly the system adopted in Swansea in the payment of grants to beneficiaries under the various Regulations of Part II. of the Statutory Committee, London. Permit me; in reference to the Statutory Committee, to express the warmest appreciation of my Committee for the very cordial way in which applications and suggestions made &apos; on their behalf have always been received by them, and to add that it is their sincere hope that similar relations will continue to exist as between them and the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions.The article of Mr. Charles J. Matthew, in&apos; the Septem-ber issue of the &quot; War Pensions Gazette,&quot; was pregnant with possibilities and the Swansea Local Committee are readily prepared to give every help to the Special Grants Committee in developing the possibilities of the policy of the forfeiture work, now controlled *by them.The Borough is divided into ten wards, and the pay-meuts of continuing grants, such as SupplementaryRent Allowances are made on the Friday of each week at Ward Centres. In certain Wards these payments are made monthly, in deference to the wishes of the beneficiaries, and the lady almoners having a close knowledge of the hom&apos;e condition of the applicants are able to advise the Central Office continuously of changes of circumstances, so that the grants can be modified or amended accordingly.All applications for grants, etc., are received at the Office of the Committee, and as this is situated in the centre of the borough the least possible inconvenience is caused to prospective beneficiaries. The lidy almoners are always supplied with a stock of the requisite Form S. 1, and all new applications are sent to the office, in order that investigation may be made by an efficient investigator in the employ of the Committee, into certain points of difficulty, which naturally present themselves. After investigation the&apos; applications; are considered by the Claims Sub-Committee and grants awarded are indicated upon the form itself and the appropriate regulation quoted, in order that the respec-tive entries may be inserted in the books which have been specially compiled for each Ward.The names of the beneficiaries are entered each week upon the Forms R. 4- by the staff of the Local Committee, and the amounts are made up from the pay sheets, and inserted in pay envelopes by the cashier. The Ward books, pay sheets and pay envelopes are then issued to the lady Almoners, by whom the direct payments are made at the Ward centres, to which I have previously referred.Except in exceptional circumstances, no payment is made other than to the person for whom the payment is intended. All returns are sent...to the cashier, and.in cases where the beneficiaries have not been able to attend for various reasons, they are asked to call in the following week at the office. The payments of Emergency Grants under Regulations 13 (6) and 13 (e) are invariably made at the office.The question of recoverable advances is one which has caused Local Committees considerable anxiety, and the remarks of Mr. T: A. Cook, Chairman, West Ham Pensions Committee, in your last issue, can be specially endorsed by the members of the Swansea Local Committee. The ,un due delays rh the assessment of Dependanfrs Allowances place Local Committees in the difficult position of being unable to determine whether a dependant is entitled to claim a Supplementary Rent Allowance under Regulation 7 (1) (6), Dependanfs Allowance under Regulation 7 (1) d, qt both these allowances.Mercantile Marine Ratings.The Swansea Borough is proud of the fact that it holds the record in Wales for the number of direct enlistments into the various branches of the Navy, and the Local Committee consequently have had to deal with a large number of cases concerning the dependants of men of naval ratings.r Amongst these is the case of the man wh^p has eventually been placed in the mercantile
marine, and whose wife or dependant receives an allotment of^the man&apos;s wages. It has frequently been found that the man, upon enlistment, had hoped to enter a branch of the naval service in which his depend-ants would have been entitled to receive both Navy allotment and separation allowance. Pending the issue of identity certificates and after enquiry at the Naval Base, Swansea, with regard to the vahdity of the enlistment of the man, the Local Committee have in good faith made recoverable advances according to the usual procedure. Subsequently upon the allottee draw-ing the allotment, it is discovered that the man belongs to a mercantile marine rating, consequently the advances made were contrary to Regulations and cannot be recovered except by application to the allottee direct, which course is not usually successful, in spite of repeated applications, for the reason that the allottees are not in a position to refund the advances.All recoverable advances are made at the office of the Committee and payment is only made by the cashier upon the reception of a docket authorising payment, and signed by the secretary. This constitutes a check upon all advances, and is of the greatest assistance to the honorary auditor in the auditing of each quarters payments. A record is also kept of the payments made upon a card made out for each beneficiary in addition to the Form S. 1, so that it is possible to ascertain readily the total of the payments received by each person on the books of the Committee. The various forms issued by the Statutory Committee for the recording of recoverable advances, etc., have been rigidly adhered to, and have proved of great value in indicating the position of the accounts of each person to whom such advances have been made.The system of card indexing is closely followed, the appropriate Forms are all attached with their relative correspondence, and these are filed numerically in cabinets and are readily accessible. The amount of clerical work involved in keeping these operations up to date is considerable, and with the ever-increasing, volume of work, is a task which fully employs the resources of the staff of the Local Committee. A similar system of filing all case papers is also in operation in the special department of the Committee&apos;s work dealing with the care of discharged disabled soldiers and sailors, to whom I shall now give my attention.The Disablement Sub-Committee in its initial stages clearly saw the necessity of co-opting amongst its members, special representatives to assist them in their important task of dealing with the treatment, training and employment of disabled men.At the present time the folio wing bodies have secured representation: the Employment Exchange Depart-ment, the Health Insurance Committee, Juvenile Employment Committee, and the medical profession.. The Director of Education and the Principal of the Swansea Technical College .also serve upon the Sub-Committee, and have rendered invaluable assistance, particularly in advisiDg upon the training of men.It may be of interest also to state that the Sub-Committee are in close touch with the Local Organisation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, and one of thi members of this body also sits upon the Sub-Committee It is proposed shortly to appoint two direct representa tives of the men, one representing discharged sailor and the other discharged soldiers.A register of disabled men was early devised am records were kept, prior to the introduction of tha compiled&apos; by the Statutory Committee. The tw registers are now kept going, and this is done for tw reasons, viz.: (a) The Statutory Committee register i used for the purpose of compiling statistical returns a to the various medical disabilities, (b) The origina register provides the additional information relative t the pre-war or pre-enlistment history of the man.There are now nearly 1,200 recorded discharges upoi the local register, and in order that the records should b as complete as possible, a personal letter is addressei to each man, upon discharge, inviting him to supply th-Local Committee with all the information required t enable them to properly consider his case. This cours did not first meet with a great response, because ; number of the men imagined that the procedure \va instituted for the purpose of effecting a decrease in thoi pensions. This suspicion, in process of time, wa completely dissipated, and the men now readily respond because they realise that the information is sought s that, if at any time they should require the help of th Disabilities Sub-Committee, all the particulars respectm them are immediately available.It has been repeatedly found that disabled men hav looked askance at the work of a War Pensions Commits because they have been in complete ignorance of it proper functions. In many cases the Committee ha. been considered as another organisation instituted fc the purpose of charity, and the only way of eradicatin. such a state of affairs is by means of propaganda in tt ranks of the men.In this connection- the Local Men&apos;s Organisation hav invited representatives of the Local Committee t: address them, and at a recent meeting of this character the Chairman of the Disablements Sub-Committee an: I had the privilege of outlining to the men assembled th instructions and notes issued by the Ministry of Pension for the training and treatment of disabled men unde Article 6 of the Royal Warrant. Another evening is t be devoted in the near future to questions upon tb above subject, and it is confidently hoped that in th adoption of these methods that the men will realise tha it is the intention of the Local Committee to bring int. their work that humanising and sympathetic considera tion for which Local Committees were instituted.Treatment.The Disablements Sub-Committee were fortunate i: having as one of their members a prominent medica practitioner, who voluntarily undertook at the offic of the Committee the examination of all men in receif of allowances under the Regulations of the Statutoi; Committee, and who recommended upon various font
267of treatment required. In the majority of cases, it has been found possible in spite of inadequate local facilities to provide treatment. The Swansea General Hospital readily consented to place at the disposal of the Sub-Committee all their available resources for out-patient treatment, and through a generous local donor, a certain number of beds can be provided for cases of paraplegia.The Sub-Committee have given special attention to tuberculous cases, and although the available accommo-dation for sanatorium treatment is by no means adequate the Local Tuberculosis Officer does everything possible to remedy the defect. This area is unfortunate in the fact that through the exigencies of the war, the building of the proposed sanatorium for the treatment of tuber-culosis was hung up at the outbreak of war and no further progress has been made.Arrangements have now been made pending the appointment of a medical referee by the Ministry of Pensions, for the men in need of treatment to be ex-amined by the medical officer of the nearest military hospital. This examination is periodically carried out through the kindness of the board of management at the Swansea General Hospital.The crying need is the provision of convalescent treatment, and as this question is now being considered by the. Joint Committee for South Wales and Monmouth-shire, it is hoped that the lack of accommodation for cases needing such treatment will be quickly remedied.Training.Men desirous of taking up training are urged to fill in forms for the purpose at the Central Office.   The Local Education Authority have placed their available re-sources at the disposal of the men, and the. Principal of the Swansea Technical College has displayed his keen interest and enthusiasm in this work by interviewing all men sent to him by the Disablements Sub-Committee. The experience of the Swansea Local Committee is that of other Local Committees in the comparative meagre-ness of the applications.   In the August issue of the &quot; War Pensions Gazette &quot; appeared this paragraph. &quot; It is no use blinking the fact that the numbers coming in to be trained are disappointingly small,&quot; but as an immediate, result of the close contact and prppaganda to which I have previously referred, the applications for training  have increased &quot;three-fold.    In  these abnormal days when so many of the discharged disabled men can find employment, at their fmger&apos;s ends as it were, the prospect of difficulties of employment after the war do not appear to be considered, but numbers of them now, with increased knowledge, are beginning to apply themselves to the problem, by making them-selves more efficient to  meet post-war conditions. Local employers have been approached for the purpose of ascertaining the extent to which they can provide facilities for training and employment in their respective local industries, and the information thus obtained is&apos; brought to the notice of the men&apos;s organisation and through the local Press. In conclusion, I have to add that the Local Com-mittee&apos;s office is how regarded as a Mecca to which the dependants of the men serving bring all their points of difficulty, and the variety of the questions dealt with are infinitely more than what may be technically demanded un der the various Regulations, but although this5 necessarily involves more labour, in attention, yet the Committee feel that it is their bounden duty to do all in their power to lighten the anxieties of those who endeavour to &quot; keep the home fires burning,&quot; and their satisfaction is assured in the realisation of the volume of success attendant upon their efforts..   ,     T. L. JENKINS, Secretary.The Disabled in Italy.-o-As a result of the Inter-Allied Conference there has been issued from the &quot; Office National des Mutilfe et R&amp;brmes de la Guerre,&quot; No. 97, Quai d&apos;Orsay, Paris, the first number of a bulletin dealing with the pension legislation of the Allied countries and of Germany. The methods adopted by the Italian Government for the assistance of disabled men; are of special interest as they appear to follow in some respects the model of the late Statutory Committee in this country.The Law of Italy, No. 481, of 25th March, 1917, sets up a National Committee for the protection and assis-tance of disabled men having a council composed of two deputies, two members of the Senate, and fifteen members representing the different Ministries, and also various pension and relief societies.. The law applies to all persons, including civilians, whose working capacity has been substantially diminished in some way or other by war service. The Committee provide financial assistance, treatment, training, which may extend over a period of six months or more in special cases, suitable employment, legal aid, etc., and make use of public and other institutions. A disabled man has the option to be exercised within a year of the war of returning to his previous occupation, or of selecting one suited to his impaired condition.A pensioner, on the security of his pension, may obtain loans from agricultural or other banks for the purpose of buying land or a house or acquiring a business. Accident insurance societies are bound to insure disabled men who have returned to work without imposing an extra premium, except in accordance with the pre-scribed regulations.Sanction has been given to a scheme submitted by the Joint Advisory Committee for Leinster and Con-naught for training disabled men as waiters, pantrymen and carvers at the Shel bourne Hotel, Dublin. A course of 12 lessons is to be given by the head waiter, who is to receive a fee of Is. per man per lesson for a class not exceeding six in number, together with an additional Is. for each man on the completion of the course. The Committee propose that this course should be followed by a further period of training in various hotels in Dublin.
The Statutory Committee.-o-(Contributed.) -o-The appearance of the Report of the Statutory-Committee affords an opportunity for a brief- con-sideration of their work, which may be of value to those upon whom their mantle has&quot; fallen.The ground work was happily planned, and it may be said without fear of contradiction that the three hundred Local Committees will remain their most enduring memorial. The Scheme setting them up was admirable in conception and has proved entirely satis-factory in operation. For the first time on record statutory representation upon an adequate scale was granted to the representatives of labour. A proper regard was paid to the great claims of women to be represented in this work. Those who had undertaken the duty previous to the formation of the Statutory Committee were not forgotten, and Local and Municipal Authorities obtained&apos;their full share of representation.The honest effort to give to the working classes the opportunity of shaijaig in the work of the Committee resulted, as might have been expected, in their obtaining throughout their period of office the hearty co-operation of representatives of labour. In the report an extract is quoted from a letter received from Mr. Bowerman stating that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress desired to express their appre-ciation of the more effective representation of the Trade Unions and other Labour organisations on the Local War Pensions, &amp;c, Committees throughout Great Britain which the Statutory Committee had in nearly all cases been ab&apos;.e to secure, and thanking them for this recognition of the claims of the local working-class organisations to the direct nomination of the representa-tives of labour.In the administration of this work, with which they are so closely concerned, the Labour repre-sentatives have been able to take their proper share and they have fully appreciated the responsibility which has been thereby laid upon them. In this respect the Statutory Committee have provided an example upon which might well be modelled other similar organisations for the future.The problems&apos; of treatment and training were approached in a sound&apos; and practical spirit by concerting schemes with those Government Depart-ments most concerned, but in this direction their efforts were hampered and delayed by the fact that they were not dealing as a Government Department with other Government Departments &apos; but as a quasi-independent body without a Minister of their own. In the matter of treatment they worked in conjunction with the War Office, the Local Government Board, the National Health Insurance Commissioners, the Public Health authorities and the Asylums &apos; Committees. In the matter of training they entered into negotiations with the Board of Education, the Board   of   Agriculture,   and the Board of   Trade.At their instigation Trad* Advisory Committees were established in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour composed of employers and workpeople, to considc questions of training, and, as a result of a conferenc with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, Advisory Wages Boards were - establishe throughout the United Kingdom to advise, as to rate of pay for discharged soldiers whose disablement migb prevent them from earning the ordinary standard rates.And yet with all this sound constructive record the life of the Statutory Committee was numbered only ir months. What brought about their dissolution ? The reply is that the Country was not content with 6 foundation well and truly laid, nor was it prepared to wait for the slow erection of a superstructure brick by brick, but mistook caution for timidity.Under their Act the Statutory Committee were not endowed with a halfpenny of public money, and were expected to beg, and such was the wording of the Act that appeal to the public could only be made through the medium of the Local Committees they had set up.When this was embodied in a circular, they found themselves the subject of bitter and persistent attack in the House of Commons and in the Press.No offices were set apart for them. To occupy scattered houses without any easy means of intercommunication leads inevitably to the &quot;water-tight compartment&apos; method extending to the administration also. It is impossible to conduct a business of such dimension: without more than one brain being concentrated upoi envisaging the problem as a whole, without constani intercourse between the various heads of &quot;departments so that they too may see beyond the daily needs of then own particular surroundings, and that they may realise by getting a glimpse of the finished ideal, in what pan of the chain their own particular department forms a link. There were grave difficulties attendant upon the impossibility of securing a suitable permanent staff unti long after the Committee had entered upon its labours The ramifications of the work were so endless, the changes so kaleidoscopic, so startling the growth, thai ground steps lost at the outset could hardly be recoveredIn conclusion it may be agreed that in the words oi the Report: &quot; The experience gained by themselves &quot; and by the Local Committees set up by them will be &quot; of lasting service,-and will render the task of the &quot; Minister of Pensions much easier than would other-&quot; wise have been the case.&quot;Negotiations are in progress with the Ministrj of Munitions with a view to the training of a limited number of men in optical instrument making. Employment in this trade was much restricted before the war owing to the competition of American, German or Austrian manufacturers, but since these sources of supply were diminished or cut off, has&apos;very substantially increased. This is largly owing to the demands of the Army, but apart from those demands it is generally recognised that the industry is one for which further development may be looked after the war.
q 1&apos;     An Explanation.?-o :-    1A desire has been expressed by more than one Local Committee for a more detailed description of the rela-tions between the Ministry of Pensions and the Special grants Committee.It cannot be too clearly emphasised that, from the point of view of the Local Committees, the Special firants Committee are an integral part of the Ministry, md that it is to the Ministry alone that all communica-ions of whatsoever nature&quot; should be addressed.From the point of view of the Ministry, on the other band, the Special Grants Committee are a body inde-oendent of the ordinary machinery of the office, though :ontained within it, whom they can call upon to act as referee, arbitrator or judge in certain cases ;   whose letisions are final; and from whom no appeal can be made :o the Ministry.   The actual powers and duties vested by itatute in the Special Grants Committee are as follows:  1. To decide any-question of fact on the deter-mination of which the amount of a -pension or grant payable out of public funds to a dependant other than a widow or child may depend.2. To decide as between two or more claimants to any pension, grant or separation allowance.3. To determine any other question in relation to grants, pensions or separation allowances which may be referred to them by the Ministry. For these three purposes the Special Grants Com-nittee are merely a deciding body and once their lecision has been given to the Ministry it becomes he decision of the Ministry itself. From such decisions here is no appeal to the Ministry or to any other body xcept to the Special Grants Committee itself which will Iways be ready to re-consider any case if any new facts .r arguments can be adduced. All cases of this kind ome before the Special-Grants Committee through the linistry of Pensions at the request of the Ministry. * ^ A sum of  500,000 has been placed at the disposal of the ;pecial Grants Committee to enable them in special cases o give pensions, grants or separation allowances in ases where none are granted out of public funds, or to upplement any pension, or separation allowance when he amount granted is inadequate. This sum will be dministered according to regulations to be drawn up by be Committee. Such regulations must be approved by he Ministry, but once approved the application thereof i in the absolute discretion of the Special Grants ommittee.      . . .All questions of forfeiture of pensions and allowances j wives, widows or dependants are dealt with by the ommittee, who also act in an advisory capacity henever the Ministry may desire their advice. There re no voluntary funds at present at the disposal of iie Special Grants Committee as all such funds in the wsession of the Statutory Committee were by the ct transferred to the Royal Patriotic Fund Cor-wation, who will be prepared to consider the possibility : helping such cases as may not come within the pro-nee of the Ministry or the Special Grants Committee..Meetings of Local Committees.East Ham.At-the monthly meeting in September it was stated that the total number of individual cases assisted by the Committee was 3,311, and the amount disbursed  5,108 3s. 2d; y Amongst the cases that had beeninvesti-gated by the Committee was that of a soldier who had been reported killed, and whose father had received the insurance money  19 10s. The soldier having since been found to be a prisoner of war, the insurance company had asked for the repayment of the money.A request was sent to the War Office for a special grant.Sheffield.In their report to the City Council the Committee make acknowledgment of the value of the services rendered by the lady helpers, and it is stated that the system of weekly payments adopted by the Committee has given satisfaction both to the Committee and the recipients of payments. Financial assistance has been given to dependents of soldiers whose pay has been temporarily stopped, or who are from other causes in need of aid. 5,649 applications have been received during the year, and over  9,000 has been expended on this branch of the Committee&apos;s work. The Com-mittee express a desire for more aid from ladies willing to undertake house visiting. More widows, it is pointed out, are being made daily by the war, and kindly interest in them at their time of sorrow is much appreciated by the lonely women.Belfast.At a meeting of the above Committee a discussion took place with reference to the desirability of finding suitable employment for men discharged from the Army and Navy, it being pointed out that in some cases *the men&apos;s pensions were taken into consideration by employers when arranging the rate of payment. It was reported that the work of the Pensions Com-mittee was becoming much greater, and that upwards of 2,000 cases per week were being dealt with in Belfast.Burton.A home for soldiers&apos; children&apos;and motherless children is being instituted at Burton.At a meeting of the Board of Guardians the Ghair-man made an appeal for assistance, and mentioned that the object of the War Pensions Committee, who had the matter in hand, was to keep the children of soldiers and motherless children out of the workhouse. At present the number of children to be lookedafter is 50.., -.. .  .     Walla sky.At the annual meeting of the Committee it was stated regarding the Disablement Sub-Committee that the one weak link in their chain was the difficulty of getting in touch with employers of labour. At present they worked through the employment exchanges, but the employers did not send their lists of vacancies to the exchanges, and they had no opportunity of corning directly in contact with employers.  They^had conse-
quently only been able tojplace a few in advantageous positions. They should endeavour through the influence of the authorities in London to bring about a better working organisation. With that object in view he proposed that the following resolution should be for-warded to the Minister of Pensions: &quot; That in all Government controlled establishments where labour is required preference should be given to men discharged from His Majesty&apos;s active forces, and to facilitate the work of the Committee by making known vacancies through the employment exchanges.&quot;Soke of Peterborough..At the annual meeting of this Committee it was resolved that notices be placed on the railway stations -and in the soldiers&apos; rest rooms, drawing the attention of all^soldiers in difficulty to the help which they could receive from the Committee.Macclesfield.In thejreport of the year&apos;s operations of this Local Committee presented to the Town Council it is stated that during the last few months the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Department have been using the organisation of the Local Committees in Cheshire, for the investigation of claims for grants from the funds of that department. Eighty-two such claims have been investigated by this Committee up to June 30th, 1917. This has further developed into the payment of grants of that department by this Committee, where it is desired by the beneficiaries, and 64 cases were thus paid in June, involving 114 payments, and a sum of  231 15s. 2d. The Ministry of Munitions, by arrangement with the Statutory Committee, also use the Local Committee for the investigation of claims for subsistence allowance put forward by men in the munition workers army reserve.West Ham.At a meeting of the above Local Committee it was reported that they had had under consideration the question of the appointment of a Special Disablement Sub-Committee, and recommended that such a Sub-Committee be formed, and that in addition to the pro-posed appointment of,two representatives of the Local Medical Association, provision be also made for the appointment of two disabled discharged men. They had had submitted to them a letter from the Forest Gate branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers asking for representa-tion upon the Local War Pensions Committee.It was eventually agreed that instead of forming a new.Committee a soldier or sailor and a doctor from each side of the Borough should be co-opted on to the existing Committees., At a meeting of the Wolverhampton branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors, held in the Labour Assembly Rooms, Mr. Alderman A. B. Bantock (chairman of the Local War Pensions Committee) and Mr. J. S. Dumbell attended and addressed the members.Co-operation with Discharged Men Association.-o-At a meeting of the War Pensions Disablement fj Committee, held on September 5th at the offices, 2,2\ Street, Leicester, Councillor W. E. Hincks, J.P., hi chair, a deputation of eight members of the Associatj of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers was received.The Chairman, on behalf of the Committee, gave t deputation a very warm welcome to the meeting, j said that since the^War Pensions Committee knew t the Association was likely to be formed they at o decided to co-opt a member of the Association on to t Disablement Sub-Cqmmittee. At a later meeting t went further, and decided to ask the Association to se a deputation to meet the Disablement Sub-Comnaitt. This was done in order that, as far as possible, thi should be the utmost harmonious working betwe the Disablement Sub-Committee and the Associati; Mr. Hincks pointed out that while his Committee wi untiring in their efforts on behalf of the disabled im they were not foolish enough to claim a monopoly consideration, nor were they so ill-advised as to thi that any other association could not render assistar in promoting the welfare of the discharged men. I stead of the War Pensions Committee having a: antagonism towards the new Association, he assut them that his Committee welcomed its institute The War Pensions Committee had been most assiduo /in endeavouring to discover every man discharged Leicester. In some proof of this, he might say tl although the official discharges were only notified the Committee in October, 1916, they had, at that tin some hundreds of men on their register who had be discharged in the period October, 1914, to October, litThey welcomed the Association, and he challeiif them to assist them in their work by discovering n so far unknown to the War Pensions Committee, a also to discover men who were suffering because insufficient pension, delay in treatment by the pens: authorities, or who were suffering any disability wL ever which the War Pensions Committee were hi position to put right. He took it that in this way&apos; Association ought to be of real service to the War P sions Committee, and what was of more importaii to the discharged disabled men. He welcomed th there that night, not as opponents, not as critics, but colleagues5 and partners in the great work of doing that lay in their power, within the regulations Government had imposed, to take care that no should have suffered in secret during the great tragic war and world-wide catastrophe which engulfed many nations. He looked on the Associate as their allies in this great and beneficent campa&apos;. and it was the least that they could do on behalf of&apos; men who had done so much for them.Mr. Charles Collins, President of the Association, introducing^he^deputation, said he did so with, pleas and confidence, as his own experience and that of
29of his fellow-discharged men led him to feel sure that there would be the utmost harmony between his Asso-ciation and New Street. He could not say how heartily glad he was personally, and he also spoke for the Asso-ciation, to receive an invitation to attend that meeting. It was clear evidence that the Pensions Committee were out to recognise his Association, and that instead of there being any suspicion regarding what his Associa-tion was out for, it showed very clearly that the Pensions Committee was out for co-operation.Councillor Sherriff (vice-chairman) also welcomed the Association. He did not intend to make a speech, but he wanted to make a request, and that was that what-ever difficulty cropped up where New Street was alleged to be at fault, they should not resort to publicity until they had given the War Pensions Office a chance of explanation. He could assure them that the office would be open to them at any time, and every facility given to them to show the steps they had taken to rectify any difficulty or disability that any discharged man was suffering from. As for himself, he felt confident that the more they knew of New Street, the more confidence they would have in the work that it per-formed. The War Pensions Committee were most earnest and serious in their work, and he could assure them that whatever could be done for the disabled man would be done for him.Other members of the deputation spoke, all expressing their appreciation of the War Pensions Committee&apos;s invitation to meet them. They also expressed their desire for harmonious working and co-operation.  /The meeting closed with a hearty vote of thanks to the Pensions Committee, not only for the chance of meeting them, but also for the work they had done in the past, and their evident intention of continuing that In-ork in the future. Leicester Daily Post.Correspondence.To the Editor, &quot;War Pensions Gazette.&quot;Dear Sir, Mr Anderson&apos;s letter in the &quot; War tensions Gazette &quot; is, I venture to suggest, most helpful to us all. Working from two different points of view, ive seem to have reached similar conclusions.The future of voluntary work will depend first on its co-operation with the local government machinery of he country with all its various activities, and secondly on its ready adaptation to changing conditions. The iecessity for providing information on these points led he National Association of Guilds of Help to&apos;join the oint Committee on Social Service, which published the andbook of Information, which was kindly noticedthe &quot; War Pensions Gazette.&quot; The demand for the andbook has greatly exceeded our expectations, and ver 12,000 copies have been circulated among both fficials and voluntary workers.Yours faithfully,&quot; 4 S. P. GRUNDY,General Secretary. Manchester City League of Help.The Training of British Prisoners Interned in Switzerland.Lord Sandwich and Major Eobert Mitchell, adviser to the Ministry of Pensions, have returned from their visit to Switzerland, and the latter has furnished the Ministry with an interesting report thereon. Colonel Picot, the officer in charge of the British interned, showed himself most sympathetic, and in company with Doctor Garnett they visited the internment camps. The information obtained is briefly siunmarised as follows : 1. Mtjrren. 520 men in camp. Small classes held in bookbinding, watchmaking, carpentry, motor mechanics, haircutting, tailoring, etc., about 50 to 60 men taking part. Instructors obtained from amongst the interned.2. Chateau d&apos;Oex. Men in camp, 550. Numbers attending classes very small.3. Leysin. 124 men. This camp is for tubercu-lous patients. Medical authorities oppose any suggestions for training, and state that, as soon as the men are capable of doing work, they are sent to one of the regular camps.4. Signal Bouljie. 41 men. A disciplinary camp, men work in the vineyards.5. Vevey. An excellent motor school under the very able direction of Lieutenant Wallas, an &apos; ex-member of the staff of the &quot; Autocar.&quot; Sixteen men have already obtained situations in the district.6. Couns. 42 men are taking a course in hotel management and waiting.7. Gunten. 20 men engaged in hand carpet making.It was evident that the existing state of affairs dis-closed a very urgent need.   -Suggestions were therefore made to the Swiss authori-ties that certain camps should be set aside as distinct industrial training centres in order to remove the disturbing influence resulting from association with those without any occupation.Altogether provision is being made for*the training and occupation of 450 to 500 men at a very early date.The chief Swiss military authority in charge of the interned has expressed his agreement with the wishes of the Pensions Minister, and the&apos; way, is now clear to proceed with the work.Lord Sandwich ^has been appointed by the British Red Cross Society to take charge of the work, and Colonel Picot has undertaken the supervision.Mrs. Bernard Dunning has most generously pre-sented to the Ministry of Pensions, for the permanent benefit of sailors and soldiers disabled ha the war, the estate and mansion of Leopardstown Park, near Dublin. The gift is free of all charges and is in perpetuity.
The Treatment and Training of the Disabled.-o-No. 6. The Inter-Allied Conference (continued).&apos; :--o- -Professional Re-education or Training. -o -Prom Fleet-Surgeon Boyden&apos;s Report. :.     - . o       . .-,This section was presided over by Dr. BourMon, Director of the School for the Disabled at Saint Maurice.Dr. Sand (Belgium), in a very complete study of pro-fessional re-education^ said that men the victims of industrial accidents usually showed a feeble power of re-adaptation, but that the contrary was true for those cripplied by warfare.The conclusions he had come to were that: (1) The loss of a lower limb interfered with a man&apos;s getting a livelihood in only a small number of trades, and that the loss of an arm also allowed the man to take up remunerative work in many cases so long as he was scientifically and individually trained.(2) It is more logical, easier and more economical to endeavour to place the man in the trade he worked at previous to his injury.(3) Each case should be individually studied before a choice of occupation is made.   The doctor in charge of the case should be the sole arbiter of the patienfs destiny as to his future work after complete study of his disability, calling in specialists to aid him in his decision, if necessity arises. Regarding  the  choice  of a  trade  the   advice of . the   technician   should   in   all   cases   be obtained.   Crowded trades or those of an unstable or non-remunerative kind should be avoided.   The kind of trades pursued in the man&apos;s native place should be taken note of. In this connection it may be of interest to say that I visited two establishments in Paris where outside trades are taught, but in which there is a great demand for workmen at the present time owing to the fact that before the war Germans were largely employed in them.(1) Government School in Rue Puits de 1&apos;Ermite, with 200 students. In this school, in addition to the teaching of book-keeping, photography, etc., a con-siderable number of men are taught the business of a furrier, which includes the preparation of the raw skins as well as the cutting of furs and making them into garments. For the first part a two to three months&apos; course is given and for the second the course averages six months. The work done appeared to be of a high-class .order, and I was informed that very good wages were obtained by the men. The school has been in existence about two years.(2) A school at 9, Rue de 1&apos;Eperon, where 25 men are taught glass-blowing. All articles made were used either in laboratories or by chemists. They comprised ampoules, pipettes, phials, etc., and were all sent tothe Central Government Laboratory at Val de Grace issue to the Army.   The course lasts three months a good man can make 400 to 500 ampoules per d The average wage earned amounted to 340 francs month.   All men employed in this establishment lost a lower limb.Dr. Dam (Belgium) divides the re-education of cripple into three stages : (a) Physical; (6) Function (c) Professional (properly speaking).The social and personal value of the maimed is of t highest importance. If he was formerly a workir he should remain so ; the intellectual can nearly ahv resume his former occupation.In choosing an occupation the doctor should exam&apos; the man (1) from the psychological side, (2) from t anatomical and physiological side.Concerning the choice of occupation Dr. Lebr (Belgium) groups the men in four categories : (1) Those who after the war will be able to resu , their former occupations. , (2) Those who are incapable of taking up th former trades. These men should be allowed, far as possible, the choice of a new occupatk. without exercising any pressure on them to enter workshop where for the moment work abounds the remuneration is great.Medical and social considerations should be 1! main factor, and the trade chosen ought to be consonance with the man&apos;s physiotherapeutic treatment. Enquiry should be made as to domicile, his social status, his resources, tastes, et and the reasons which urge him to choose the tra in question ; and in this connection it must borne in mind that he will speedily abandon trade into which he has been urged to enter more less against his will.(3) Those whose financial condition is such tl no trade is of use to them. For these men pr fessional (manual) work will be prescribed by t doctor solely with the view of physiotherapy, a: he will choose a suitable workshop where it can 1 carried out.- (4) Complete invalids who cannot be re-educate These latter will have to be supported by the St?, and every effort should be made to ameliorate the condition.Dr. Nyns (Belgium) was of the opinion that tl deformity itself does not give absolute indication as&apos; choice of trade, although it is the chief one. He b; noted that men with similar lesions differed large with regard to the aptitude they displayed during the apprenticeship.One-armed men were the most difficult to re-eduea&apos; and should therefore be advised to take up work n cessitating the use of one arm only, or work of a nor manual character. iThose with various lesions of the upper limb short amputation require careful selection for their lie employment. *With regard to men having lost a lower limb it is
hiistake to suppose they cannot take up a trade ,cessitating their standing, up.)Ien with head injuries should not enter trades where iere might be danger of accident through giddiness or here the posture is of a nature to aggravate the lesion. Jl; Jouve (France) found that in his school at Mon-ju&quot;-e only a small percentage of the maimed take up eir former work or even one akin to it.   Much depends!0n the will-power of the man in overcoming difficulties well as on his inherent dexterity. He has never yet d to call for medical advice as to whether a man 5uld or should not continue in his new occupation, the future he considers that owing to shortage of oour electrical power will come more to the front, and ivises men to take up this form of mechanical work they are fit for it, and further it would be extremely eful for those working at their homes in making toys, rts of clocks, etc., employing an electric motor for e purpose.Dr. Pierrot (France) thought that men should not be iced in large factories as labourers where they would itainly gain a wage, but would never advance, and raid compete with valid men to their mutual detriment.the contrary a trade should be chosen where com-tition is less and where the men would be, more dependent. Labour saving machinery has rendered e livelihood of mechanics precarious,- but has created &quot; repairer &quot; who can be well employed mending icks and watches, agricultural implements, boots and ithes, etc.Dr. Curie (France) said than on account of the large mber of the maimed entering schools of instruction ere is a marked tendency to classify them by &quot; slips &quot; lording to their injury and to dispense with the careful animation by doctors and technicians, which he nsiders indispensable to the man&apos;s future welfare. M. Alleman (Belgium), who is director of studies at .rt Villez, gave the indispensable factors in the choice a profession under the following headings :  A. Physical Aptitude. A searching medical examina-n should be*made in order to exclude the candidate m work, requiring certain movements or efforts den are incompatible with his disability. It thus lows that the doctor should be au fait with the wements required in each industry.Predilection. Compulsion should never be em-yed. In certain schools 80 per cent, of failures have :urred through misconception of this principle, ose of apathetic nature should be stimulated by miple and persuasion on the part of both instructors advanced pupils demonstrating to them what can I done by application and patience.Habitual Residence. Agricultural workers should ;e up their previous occupation ; rural artisans )uld remain in -their villages and town dwellers in ir towns.D. Previous Occupation. Use should be made of ?erience gained by men in their previous employment directing them to take up occupations of a similar :ure using the same raw materials of which they havesome knowledge. A fitter or mechanic could become a designer, a mason or carpenter an inspector of work, etc.B. Intellectual Capacity. Certain trades require in-, tellectual capacity, and thus men in this category who have lost an arm could be usefully employed in intellectual occupations, e.g., bookkeepers, managers, teachers, etc., the author only having limited confidence in the efficiency of artificial apparatus in place of a hand.F. Moral Qualities.- Will power, tenacity and patience should be steadily cultivated, and the feeble who before the war had tried several trades should not be put into occupations requiring long and sustained effort.Gr. Financial State.- Certain trades require the pos-session of some capital, and unless funds can be obtained from charitable societies men should not enter them, though efforts should be made .to prevent men falling in social status..Dr. Leullier (France) considered that the choice of profession ought not to be left to the fancy of the injured man, but the doctor should give him all informa-tion possible as to his disabilities and the kind of work he was fit to take up. If he talked freely to the man it was rare that he did not consent to take up the occupation most suitable to his capacity.Mile. Meyer (France) considered that a preliminary stage lasting perhaps as long as two to three months was necessary to guide a man in the choice of his new profession before proceeding to re-education proper.Dr. Dijonneau (France) was of the opinion that constant medical supervision of men working in the schools and shops is.a necessity, as it is only by doing so that a maximum output, will be reached without unduly fatiguing the men.&apos; Captain Haccour defines the aim of professional re-education as follows : &quot; To provide disabled soldiers with new means of gaining a livelihood in civil life in place of those they have lost by reason of their injuries.&quot;This authority was also in favour of giving the men free choice of a calling; and, to make this a practical proposition, he thinks that every school should provide instruction in as many trades as possible.In the discussion which followed, a Belgian speaker said he was strongly in favour of convalescent hospitals ,and workshops being in juxtaposition.M. de Paeuw (Belgium), who was in full agreement with others as to the necessity of bringing disabled men before a Council composed of a doctor, an educationalist, and a technician, after analysing the views of the foregoing writers drew the following conclusions : 1. The interest of the man should be the chief concern of the Council.2. He should, if possible, be re-educated in his old occupation unless his professional capacity had been reduced by his wounds to below 80 per cent, or the work was not sufficiently remunerative, or harmful to his physical or moral state, or that the man felt himself rightly or wrongly incapable of exercising it again.3. If he is obliged to change his trade, there isfl
much, advantage in placing him in another of a similar nature but less tiring, in order that his previous knowledge of his craft, which will be invaluable, shall not be lost to him.Owing to the tendency of the rural population to seek work in. towns, it is of prime importance that men should be persuaded to work on the land.4. Disabled men should be encouraged to become artisans and work in their own homes, being aided by apparatus driven by electricity. &apos;5. If the man has lost an arm, an artificial limb should not be forced upon him, but it should only be supplied to those who desire it for the purpose of continuing the occupation they had before the war. M. de Paeuw noted that the marked inclination of men to try for soft jobs should be strongly combated by pointing out that the number of such posts is strictly limited, and that they would be much happier and more independent in learning a trade which would bring them in a decent wage.   Also he gives a warning concerning a class of apathetic individuals who accept&apos;the first job they are offered with the intention of leaving it at the earliest opportunity.The Advisory Council, the constitution of which has &apos; already been given, will assume all responsibility as to the man&apos;s choice of occupation, and once he has made his choice he will go to the workshops on a fortnighfs trial. If at the end of that period it is found that he is unable to make any progress he is brought before the Council again, who will do their best to place him in some other kind of work.A conference has, been held lately to consider the. training to be offered to invalided officers. The demand for training at the present time,is very small, but it may reasonably be expected to expand. The view of the conference was that the most promising forms of training which can be offered would be (a) in engineering and other branches of applied science such as chemistry,, and. (b) in commercial subjects ofi a superior kind, in-cluding foreign languages. For both forms of training the! universities,,both old and new, will be able to afford facilities. It is proposed to formulate suggestions to officers in a note of which the draft will be,considered ata further conference.-o-Sanction has been given to a scheme submitted by the Local Committee for Wimbledon to provide training for disabled men in agriculture and nurserymen&apos;s work with the firms of Messrs. Luff &amp; Son, landscape gardeners, of Wimbledon Park ; Messrs. Thomson, of Wimbledon ; Messrs. Carter, of Raynes Park, S.W.; on condition that the training extends over one year,&apos; and that the firms agree, after two months&apos; training, to pay wages of an amount approved by the Local Committee. If possible the Committee are to obtain a guarantee from the firms in question to retain the men on their perma-nent staffs after the completion of the course.Committee on Institutional Treatment.-o-Report for, the Period ending 12th August, 191( -o-The Committee was formally constituted in Februa 1917, the bodies represented on it being the Ministry Pensions and the War Pensions Statutory Committe the War Office and the Joint War Committee of th British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John o Jerusalem in England, these bodies being respective! represented by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Arthur Grifnt Boscawen, M.P. (Parliamentary Secretary of the Minis try of Pensions, who is Chairman of the Committee&apos; Sir; Cyril   Jackson,    Colonel  Sir  Walter  Lawrence Bart., G.C.I.E., K.C.I.E., C.I.E., and the Hon. Arthei Stanley, C.B., M.V.O&apos;., M.P., Lieutenant-Colonel S&apos; Alfred Pearce Gould, K.C.V.O., was appointed a membe of the Committee in August, 1917.        ,The functions of the Committee are to arrange fc the provision of suitable institutional treatment fo certain men totally disabled while serving in H&apos; Majesty&apos;s Forces, e.g., paraplegics, neurasthenics epileptics and advanced cases of tuberculosis. Th Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross an the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in England provid or helps to provide as far as its funds permit the initia outlay involved in establishing and equipping institu tions, but makes no. contributions to the cost o maintenance, which is borne by the State.The First Meeting of the Committee was hel d or Monday, 12th February, 1917, the Right Hon. G. S Barnes, M.P., Minister of Pensions, being present.A sum of  20,000 was placed at the disposal of th Committee by the Joint Committee of the Red Cross and Order of St. John, and subsequently a further sua of  10,000 was similarly placed for capital expendituri in connection with institutions. The following wer appointed as advisers of the Committee on speck branches of the work : Neurasthenia      ...   Colonel Sir John Collie.Epilepsy   ...      ...   Dr. C. Hubert Bond..   Tuberculosis      ...   Major H. S. Hartley, C.V.O.Paraplegia ...   Dr. R. Fox-Symons.Finance   ......   Sir H. Ha ward.The Committee confines itself to initiatory, co-ordinating, advisory and supervisory functions. The actual management and administration of institutions being done by Local Committees or supervised by local authorities.A number of houses and institutions have beei offered to the Committee for the establishment of Homes of Recovery and treatment, and in each case have beer, inspected and reported on as to their suitability by the Special Medical Advisers in their respective Departments. In setting up institutions in various parts of the country the Committee not only aims at providing the necessary medical care and treatment, but also wherever possible at providing healthy outdoor work and suitable training-
those of the patients who are^able to undertake, ht work during the course of their treatment. Assist-[e with regard to after treatment is regarded by theumittee as being of the utmost importance.NEURASTHENIA. Home of Recovery for the treatment of neurasthenia other functional diseases of the nervous system in case of discharged soldiers and sailors has been fened at Highfield, Golders Green.   At&apos; the present L there are 82 patients in the institution and 182 luting admission.   Steps are already being taken to Ivide accommodation for a further fifty cases. Irrangements have been completed for the establish-[nt of a Home at Leicester Frith, Leicester, with lommodation for fOO beds.   The cost of establishing equipping this institution is being borne out of a Id raised by the Mayor of Leicester, in addition to ch the building is given free of rent, irrangements have also been completed for a Home Allerton Hall, Leeds, to accommodate at least 100 Is.ifr. John Leigh has placed his house and land at rincham at the disposal of the Ministry, and is fitting and equipping it at his own expense.  He is also inging for the establishment of a garden for intensive ich culture in connection  with the institution, ommodation will be provided for up to 100 patients. &apos;he establishment of other institutions is at present ler consideration.   A plant for intensive culture is ailed at the Home of Recovery, Golders Green, and proposed to make this institution the model for Neurasthenic institutions in the country.   A House of lovery has also been opened at Craig Avon, Belfast, the arrangements in this case were not made by J Institutional Committee but by the Ministry and Ulster Volunteer Committee.,oting on the advice of Sir John Collie, the Adviser Neurasthenics, the Committee has decided that it is tlutely necessary for the success of this class of itution that it should have a resident medical officer harge, and that no institution should be officially gnised which does not provide accommodation for ast 50 beds.EPILEPSY. ,    .ccommodation to the extent of 306 beds has been ided or is in course of provision, especially for harged sailors and soldiers who are in need of tutional treatment for epilepsy, as follows :  ikree cottage homes, each to accommodate twenty-men at Chalfont Colony, Guards Cross, Bucks, cottage homes, each with accommodation for 40 at Lingfield Colony, Surrey ; there are also work-s at this Colony.   A villa for 45 men at Monyhull ny, Birmingham ; 82 beds at Maghull Colony, near rpool; and 24 beds at the David Lewis Colony, rley, Cheshire.   Negotiations are in progress forJSng similar need in Scotland, and the Scottish itutional Committee has this in hand.   Considera-tion is also being given as to the extent to which it may be necessary to provide corresponding accommodation in Ireland and in those districts of England and Wales which are inconveniently remote from the above-men-tioned colonies, it being recognised that reasonable proximity of such centres for treatment and training to the homes and friends of the men is highly desirable.TUBERCULOSIS.The management of the Metropolitan Asylums Board have provided 150 beds for advanced cases of tuber-culosis, placing at the disposal of the Committee a pavilion should it be required in each of seven of their hospitals. At the present time two pavilions providing accommodation for 32 beds are open for the reception of patients, and twenty-seven beds are occupied.Arrangements have been made for accommodation for 50 patients at Brierley Hall, Bradford, and for a lien on 30 beds for advanced and Colony cases at the Cam-bridgeshire Tuberculosis Colony at Papworth Hall. Provision is being made for the erection of pavilions in various parts of the country which are regarded as suitable localities for advanced cases.Major H. S. Hartley, C.V.O., the Committee&apos;s adviser on tuberculosis, advocated the bunding of small pavilions in connection with county fever hospitals or sanatoria. A plan for a standard pavilion has been approved, which has the advantage of fitting in with existing organisations and gives an opportunity of placing patients near their own homes. , The liability of the Ministry is fixed at 35s. per occupied bed per week, the local authority being responsible for upkeep and maintenance, tj, PARAPLEGICS.Prior to the constitution of this Committee provision had.been made at the Star and Garter Home, Richmond, for accommodation for 64 patients of this class.Lonsdale House has been established with accommo-dation for 25 patients, and is really used as a clearing house for London.Up to the 30th June last 912 paraplegic cases had been dealt with and placed in various institutions which had put beds at the Committee&apos;s disposal, and in some cases-where considered advisable patients were -transferred to their own homes.Questions and Answers.Q. 40. A soldier was an apprentice for five years, the apprenticeship terminating on December 3rd, 1914, when he at once got employment at his journeyman&apos;s wages of 30s. a week. He enlisted on February 25th, 1915, and dependence was only calculated at5s., the fexplanation being that his journeyman&apos;s wages were averaged with his apprentice wages.. Is there any ground for an appeal against this assessment ? , .A. An appeal should certainly be made for a re-assessment of dependence. Each such case][is dealt with by the War Office Appeals Committee on its individual merits.
Q. 41. a soldiers wife, who was residing in london at the time of his enlistment, goes to live in the country for some months: while she is away she pays 3s. 9d. a week for storage of furniture. on her return to london is she eligible for london bent allowance 1A.-Yes. ,A payment which has ceased on the^payee leaving London may be resumed when the payee returns on production of satisfactory evidence of a continuous bona fide payment during the whole period of absence for either rent or storage of furniture in the London Postal Area.Q. 42. are the wives and dependants of men serving with the expeditionary force canteens eligible for assistance under part ii. of the regulations ?A. The answer is in the negative. These men are not in receipt of Army pay or emoluments, and&apos; their relatives or dependants are not entitled to any payment from Army Funds except in cases of disablement or death. They are, therefore, excluded from the definition of &quot;soldier &quot; in Regulation 2, and no advances, grants or allowances can be given under the Regulations.Q. 43. in the instructions and notes on the treatment and training of disabled men recently issued, are local committees obliged to give the maximum allowance stated in paragraph 34 (sections a and b).A. The object of the allowances to be paid under this paragraph is to afford every inducement to the man to accept training. The answer therefore is in the affirmative.*Q. 44. when a married soldier is reported missing the separation allowance and allotment is continued for 26 weeks, at the end of which time the pension for his wife comes into force. should not this equally apply in the case of a dependant (i.e., parent) who was also receiving dependant allowance besides allotment %A.-In the case of a dependant receiving separation allowance and allotment the allowances do continue for .26 weeks.Q. 45. royal warrant, of 29th march, 1917, paragraph 12, children^ allowances to widows. does the designa-tion &quot; first child^&apos; refer to the eldest ? for example, take the case of a widow with four children at ages of 15, 13, 11 and 9 respectively. when the child aged 15 attains the age of 16, what proportion of the allowance of 15s. per week will cease, 5s. or 2s. 6d. ?. A. 2s. 6d. only ceases. The 5s. attaches to the first child entitled to an allowance. .fQ. 46. instructional^ of the instructions and nolcm on treatment and training states that it is one of turn duties of the local committee on the completion of a man&apos;M treatment or training to pay to him any balance of th[ allowance due to him in respect of the period of treatmei\ - or training, but that if that period is shorter than thai contemplated by the local committee on account of thi man&apos;s refusal to continue the treatment or training, them no further amount shall be paid to the man in respect o\ the allowance otherwise due to him.   should it be iakcm from this that if the man has consented to receive only portion of the allowance due to him during that treatmcn or training, and thereafter such a termination of the periot takes place as is contemplated, is it not permissible for th local committee to pay to him a sugn in the aggregait equal to the sums which he might have had paid to kin weekly, had he so desired it ?A. An allowance is given in consideration of hi undergoing a &quot; course &quot; of training. If he does no carry out this course of training then he is not entitle! to any amount over and above what was necessary t enable him to maintain himself during that period.Q. 47. does part ii., reg. 13 (g) (as contained circular no. 57), mean that any soldier who is certific, to be unfit to work within first six months after dischan at anything can have his pension raised to the maximun counting whatever amount of insurance benefit he may i receiving as 5s. other income, and if he is not receivin any benefit not counting anything into other income. tl latter clause would take in soldiers like the &quot; o. and P.,f who so often refuse to. pay ?A. This Regulation has been misunderstood, applies only to cases in which no medical treatment I required, but in which the medical referee certifies thaj the man needs rest and nourishment at home and unable to work. Under the Statutory CommitiJ regulation the 5s. insurance benefit must be taken inlj account.Q. 48.-when should (part ii., reg. 7 (1) (d) ) m increase beissued with retrospective effect, from januar\ 1917 ?A. Speaking generally, allowances under Part 1 Regulations should only be paid from the date of appi cation, but if in any special case under Regulation (1) d the Local Committee are satisfied that debts hai been incurred as a result of the delay in making applk; tion, a retrospective grant may be made to meet sut debts. Application for covering sanction should made to the Special Grants Committee if the amouij proposed to be granted exceeds  2./ LONDON:m - &apos; PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE.To w purchased through any Bookseller or directly from H.M.

PREFACE.This Report is one of a series which is being issued by the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collabora-tion with the Ministry of Pensions and has been prepared by the Furniture Trade Advisory Committee. The information is intended not only for the use of the Local War Pensions Committees, Em-ployment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Institutes, and Military Hospitals, but also for the use of Employers and Workpeople, and any who are interested in the problem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as to the trades and industrial processes in their own areas which are especially suitable for disabled men. -This series of reports is confined to trades which are to be found in every part of the country or which cover a much wider area than that of any single Local Committee. The information collected for this Report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed knowledge which Local Committees have already in their possession or will be able to acquire with regard to their own local conditions.Trade Advisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers).A Trade Advisory Committee has been set up by the Ministry - of Labour in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions to advise these Departments as to the conditions under which the training of disabled men in the Furniture trade can best be given, the best methods of training, the suitable centres for such training, and generally so as to secure uniformity in the training of disabled men.

PART I.GENERAL REMARKS.Furniture Making is fairly well distributed over the country, the chief centres are London, Edinburgh, High Wyeombe, Bristol, Bath, Barhstaple, Manchester, Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, Beith, Locbwinnoch and Kirkcaldy; but manufacturers are to be found in most provincial towns.The census of 1911 gives the number of adult male workers employed in England and Wales as 72,229 and in Scotland 11,204.A large proportion of the manufacturing is carried on in large modern factories, well equipped with up to date machinery and appliances.Owing to the development and use of highly specialised machinery and tools a system of construction has been evolved which renders the manufacturing of some kinds of furniture that are now being made a comparatively simple process, not calling for any excessive physical exertion and suited for the employment of disabled men of a fair degree of intelligence.PROSPECTS.It is believed that employers would vie with each other in giving employment to disabled men Avhose sufferings and disabdities must appeal ^most strongly to all sections of the public and not least to employers.The principal openings for the employment of disabled men will be found in the large furniture factories. The type of instruction should be in harmony with the modern system of furniture manu-facturing where machinery enters so largely into the system of construction.Care must be taken that no employer shall have an undue advantage from the employment of disabled men, and in the interest of the ordinary workmen employed and the trade generally the Trade Advisory Committee hf*ve aimed at securing that the conditions of employment of disabled men during the training and thereafter shall be such as not&apos; injuriously to affect the employ-ment of other workmen in the trade.SUITABILITY OF THE WORK FOR DISABLED MEN.Of the undermentioned processes (1 to 13 below) generally it may be said that a man with one leg (replaced by artificial limb) would not be severely handicapped. All are performed under cover and the work entailed is not of a heavy nature. There are a few processes at which a man who has lost two or three fingers or even a thumb could work, while in French Polishing a suitable man might possibly be employed who has lost a band, though in such cases the loss would be a handicap.THE FURNITURE TRADE.
1. LINING OR MARKING OUT OF TIMBER..-.:Tbis work is done in a great many cases by men-with an all round knowledge of the trade, but some shops afford an opening for disabled men. Such men would be under the supervision of the Foreman in Charge of. the. Timber Yard or Machine Department.Suitability.Given that arrangements are made to bring the planks to the liners there seems no reason why this work should not be suitable for one-legged men.Prospects.Four or five men are usually employed in a shop.2. MACHINE WORK.(e.g. Sawing, Planing, Moulding, Jointing, Boring, Dovetailing, and Sandpapering Machines and attending Automatic Carving, Turning Saw Sharpening and Tool Grinding Machines).i Many of the machines in use do light, simple processes, are quite safe to use, and have guards or fences to protect the workman. In many of the factories the saws, cutters, plane irons, &amp;c, are in charge of a skilled workman who is responsible for the setting and sharpening of same. A comparatively short training should enable a man to operate an ordinary machine quite satisfactorily.Suitability.Where effective guards are provided most of these machines are such that one-legged men or men injured in the leg could operate without difficulty.But it must be remembered (1) that a machine such as the spindle would be dangerous for a: man who was not firm on his feet, (2) that the constant standing involved is very trying to men suffering from an injury to the muscles or ligaments of the leg. This is specially the case with machines at which the operators stand sideways to push the wood through, such as the Overhand Planer and Circular Saw.At one or two machines, e.g. the Vertical Borer, Fret Saw, Carving Machine, it should be possible to provide for the operators to sit. ,As regards (other disabilities, the following points are to be noted:      . ..&apos;(1) The full use of both arms is&apos; essential in the case of all machinists ; (2) Good hearing, though not essential, is a considerable help to a machinist, as it enables him to know when the machine is running properly or not; (3) The machine shop is unsuitable for men suffering from neurasthenia, shell shock and chest complaints.Prospects.&quot;There is a good present demand for wood machinists, but in many cabinet making firms, engaged temporarily on munition work, there has been a considerable substitution of juvenile and female labour
for male labour. - The prospects after the war for wood machinists are bright, as the anticipated expansion in the furniture trade is likely to be most marked on the machine side.3. WOOD TURNING.The old fashioned foot-driven wood turning lathe is now largely discarded; and the modern belt-driven lathe is a great improve-ment. Much of the work is of a plain design and pattern and of a repetition character, which would permit of a man being quickly trained.Suitability and Prospects. As for machine work above.4 and 5. CABINET AND CHAIR MAKING.Some of the work of the Cabinet Maker and Chair Maker under modern conditions has been greatly simplified through the advances that have been made in recent years in machine construction and preparation of the materials. A man of ordinary skill could very readily be trained; the main essential would be instruction in the use of the tools required and their maintenance in good order.Suitability.Some of the work is of a quiet nature, suitable for one-legged, or one-eyed or deaf men ; also for men suffering from neurasthenia or certain forms of shell shock.Prospects.Cabinet Making and Chair Making present opportunities for the employment of a certain number of disabled men.6. CARVING AND INLAY.Suitability.As for Cabinet Making.Prospects.The application of Carving and Inlaying to Furniture io subject to the influence of change of fashion. In recent years much of the Furniture manufactured has been without carving, and when it.has been applied it is in many instances of a subdued and reserved description. The use of automatic carving machines has made the acquisition of the necessary skill comparatively easy; and, although the demand for men for carving and inlay work is limited, any man with an aptitude should be encouraged to apply as he could be quickly taught the elementary branches of the trade. &quot;Such training, however, would be of no use for the higher grades of carving.
72277. SANDPAPERING (BY HAND).In nearly all factories the Cabinet Maker sandpapers his own work; in some chair making centres the chairs are sandpapered by women and boys.   The -opening for men would be very limited.Suitability.Considerable right arm pressure is required involving strain on the legs, but it is possible that a man with one leg replaced by a wooden leg would not be handicapped.8. FRENCH POLISHING.In many centres in the North, girls and women are employed principally upon chairs. For the polishing of Cabinet Furniture a high degree of skill is necessary ; and good physical condition with the free use of the right hand and arm is indispensable.Suitability.In carcase work a man with an artificial left arm would not be handicapped in polishing the heavier articles of furniture; it is to be noted that in France one armed men - have been trained as French Polishers during the war.As regards other disabilities polishing would not be a good trade for those suffering from a weak heart. &apos; The atmosphere of a polishing shop is invariably warm, free from dust but often stuffy. It would be suitable for rheumatic cases and for men suffering from gassing or shell shock.Prospects.There was considerable unemployment among polishers before the war and a very large percentage (35%) have joined His Majesty&apos;s Forces, who will naturally have the first claim upon vacancies. On the other hand it is stated that there has always been a dearth of skilled polishers and there is a good present demand for polishers. Women have been trained in considerable numbers since the war but are employed mainly on preparatory work.&quot;9. UPHOLSTERY.The stuffing of loose seats for chairs is a simple process that could be readily acquired, also pin seat or skate stuffing and full spring stuffing of small and arm chairs.The same remarks apply to mattress making and the cutting of loose covers.Suitability.This is for the most part a sedentary occupation suitable for one legged men. Other disabilities which would not handicap a man severely are loss of. an eye, deafness, neurasthenia, shell shock or rheumatism. Men suffering from chest complaints should not be introduced on account of the dust from the flock,- &amp;c.Prospects.Constant demands for disabled men have been received from employers in all parts of the country.
i outraging, drawing and designing.The opeDings for the above are very limited, but might be found for men who bad a natural gift for drawing.Suitability.-This being entirely sedentary work is most suitable for men badly injured in leg or thigh. Other disabilities which would not handicap a man would be deafness, neurasthenia, shell shock, chest complaints or rheumatism..11. GLASS BEVELLING BY MACHINERY.12. SURFACE POLISHING OF MIRRORS.13: GLASS   COPPERING,  VARNISHING (BUT NOT SILVER MIXING) OF MIRRORS.General remarks.The total number of male workers employed in this trade before the Avar was.about 2,000.The seven principal centres (of which London is the largest) are : London, Birmingham, St. Helens, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Glasgow.Suitability.Only men in a sound state of health should be introduced on account of the damp and dust involved. Deafness or loss of a leg ^replaced by wooden would not be a severe handicap.PART ii. TRAINING.The Furniture Trade has been declared by the Minister of Pensions.to be a Special Trade for the purposes of Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, and the following additional instructions have been issued by the Minister of Pensions to Local War Pensions Committees to regulate the training of disabled sailors and soldiers in the Trade: Instructions issued by the Minister of Pensions to &quot; &apos;  Regulate the Training of Disabled Men in the :&apos;  Furniture Trade.In order that the training of disabled men may be so regulated as not to conflict with the interests of employers and employed in the trade, the Minister of Pensions has, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour and the Furniture Trade Advisory Committee, laid down in accordance with Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, the following conditions to be observed in regard to the training of men in the Furniture Trade, henceforth to be deemed a &quot;SpecialTrade&quot; for the purposes of that Instruction.Any course of training already being given or proposed to-be given by a Local War Pensions Committee shall, if the allowances or fees under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are to be paid,
comply with the following conditions, unless, in any case, the Minister of Pensions otherwise determines.1. The course of training in any process shall be divided into(a) a Probationary Period ; (b) an Improver&apos;s Period. 2. In all processes, with the exception of glass processes, the Probationary Period shall be spent in a technical school, under a scheme approved by the Minister of Pensions, wherever, in the opinion of the Local War Pensions Com-% mittee, the man could conveniently attend such a course. 3. Where the man cannot, in the opinion of the Local War Pensions Committee, conveniently attend a course in a technical school, training during the Probationary Period may be given in a factory or workshop.4. The Improver&apos;s Period shall be spent always in a factory or workshop.5.- In the case of each process the length of training and the minimum rate of wages payable by the employer to the disabled man (wherever the training is given in a factory or workshop) shall be as stated in the followiug table.TRAINING COURSE.Name of Process.Probationary Period.Length jOf period ,in weeks.Improver&apos;s period.Wages payable if j Length period is spent in !of period factory or workshop, in weeks.Drawing and de-signing (only for men specially gifted).Carving and inlayUpholsteryFrench polishingCabinet-making ...Chair-makingMachine workWood turning   ...Lining or marking out of timber.Sandpapering by hand.Glass bevelling, machine process.Surface polishing of mirrors.Cleaning, copper-ing, varnishing, and silvering of mirrors (but not silver mixing).5226 26 26 26 12 12 12 124 44First 4 weeks nil.

The first month of training shall be a trial period.   If at the end of this period the man is considered unsuitable for12596A2
the trade, his training shall cease. In the case of factory or workshop training, the employer shall agree at the end of the trial period, if the man proves suitable, to,retain him in his factory or workshop until the end of his course of training.7. Where in the case of factory or workshop training the em-ployer pays the disabled man a weekly sum in addition to the minimum wage mentioned in Instruction 5 as a bonus for increased efficiency, any such bonus or weekly sum shall not be taken into consideration in calculating the amount of the Maintenance Allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee.8. The cost of tools for training purposes as recommended in the Syllabus (see Appendix A) not exceeding the price of  2 10s. per set for each man being trained shall be paid by the Ministry of Pensions.9. Where any employer takes a man for training in his factory or workshop, whether during the Probationary Period or tniprover&apos;s Period, he shall agree, if. he retains the man in his employment at the end of the course of training, to intimate to the Joint Shop Committee (if any), consisting of an equal number of representatives of the management and workpeople employed in the same department as the disabled man, the rate that he intends to pay to the disabled man so that the wages may be reconsidered if necessary ; and any subsequent change in wages shall similarly be reported to the Joint Shop Committee so as to ensure that the man&apos;s services are adequately remunerated.10. It shall be a condition of training in a factory or work-shop that in any case considered suitable by the Local Technical Advisory Committee (see below), if such exists, the disabled man shall be allowed during his Improver&apos;s Period to attend a Technical School during the working-hours for a period not exceeding five hours per week.Local Technical Advisory Committees. 11. Where any training for disabled men in the Furniture Trade has been approved by the Minister of Pensions, and where the Minister of Labour on the advice of the Furniture Trade Advisory Committee has set up for the area in which the training is to be given a Local Technical Advisory Committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives of associations of employers and work-people, then provided such Committee is recognised by the Ministry of Pensions after consultation with the Ministry of Labour, as representative of the Trade in that area, the   Local   War  Pensions  Committee  by whom  the training is arranged shall consult this Local Technical -Advisory Committee in regard to the following points :  [ax the selection of candidates for training, with regard to their suitability for the trade ;   -(b) the suitability of the training offei-ed  in technical schools and similar institutes ;
(c) the suitability of the training offered in fac-. tories and workshops with special referenceto the prospects of permanent employment and the rate of wages offered at the termin-ation of the training ;(d) any other technical point arising out of thetraining of disabled men for this trade.. 12. The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall inform the Local War Pensions Committee and the Furniture Trade Advisory Committee if at any time, in their opinion, a sufficient number of men have been trained for their trade in the area with which they are familiar, having regard to the number of men which the trade in that area could reasonably be expected to absorb. .jSLB. Instruction. 5 above should be read in connection with Schedule. IV, paragraph 7, to be found on page 21 of the instructions on the Training and Treatment of disabled men under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March 29th, 1917, which runs as follows :-&quot; The employer shall during any part of the period of training pay the man such wage, if any, as represents the net value of the man&apos;s work to.the employer, and the allowance paid to the man under Instruction 34 shall be reduced by the amount of such wage or any portion thereof.&quot; Thus, for instance, in Cabinet Making a disabled man with no children would receive during the first four weeks of his training 27.i. 6d. a week from his Local War Pensions Committee, during the 5th to the 26th week 10s. from his employer and 17s. 6d. from his Local Committee, during the 27th to the 39th week 155. from his employer and 12s. 6d. from the Committee, and from the 39th to the 52nd week 20s. from his employer and 7s. 6d. from the Committee.instruction 7 lays down that if the employer chooses to pay the disabled man more than this minimum wage this would be an extra payment for the disabled man and would not affect the Maintenance Allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee.During the whole time that a disabled man is under training his pension is temporarily withdrawn and he receives the full Maintenance Allowance (see page 12) from the Local War Pensions Committee in substitution for his pension. As soon as his training is finished the Maintenance Allowance will be withdrawn and the man will receive his pension again.Technical Schools.The Furniture Trade Advisory Committee has also made the following recommendation : That Technical school classes should be as soon as possible established in the following centres : London, Glasgow or Edinburgh, High Wycombe and Manchester, and that enquiries.be made as to the possibility of establishing similar classes in Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol or Bath and Leeds.
Syllabus.The Furniture Trade Advisory Committee has prepared a Syllabus (Appendix A) specifying the kind of instruction and equipment desirable for the training of disabled men whether in Technical Schools or in factories or workshops. The Syllabus is intended to be a guide to Local War Pensions Committees, Local Technical Advisory Committees, and other bodies who may be interested in the training of disabled men as to the lines on which training should be given.WAGES.The wages of skilled adult male workers in the different branches of the Trade vary at present between 9d. and Is. 3//. per hour according to the locality.ADVISORY WAGES BOARDS.The Minister of Labour is setting up Advisory Wages Boards in the principal towns to advise as to the question of the wages that should be paid to individual disabled men, taking into consideration the nature of their disability. Any workman or employer in the district can obtain the advice of the Advisory Wages Board as to the rate of wage which an individual disabled man should be paid for performing certain specified work.The Boards are instructed to have regard to the current rate of wages for similar work in the district and to the capacity of the man whose case they are considering for such work. They are not to have regard to any pension to which the man may be at the time entitled.The question of the wages to be paid to disabled men who have received training through a Local War Pensions Committee wdl raise&apos; problems of a special nature on which the Local Technical Advisory Committee (see page 11, Instruction 11 (c) ) will have expert knowledge and it has therefore been decided by the Minister of Labour that the Advisory Wages Board shall only deal with the case of a disabled man who has been trained or is being trained by a Local War Pensions Committee, upon a specific request by the Local War Pensions Committee concerned or with the expressed con-currence of that Committee.MAINTENANCE DURING TRAINING.A disabled man if eligible to be given training by his Local War Pensions Committee may receive during the course of training an allowance of 27s. 6d. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer), with additional allowances for children at the rate of 5s. for the first, 4s. 2d. for the second, 3s. 4c?. for the third, and 2s. 6d. for each subsequent child; and if this training necessitates his living away from home and he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) is given for his wife, together with childrems allowances at the rate mentioned above. In addition to this any fees in respect of training will be paid by the Minister, and at the end of it an amount equal to 5s. for
each week the training lasted wdl be paid by the Ministry to the man as a bonus for satisfactory attendance.APPLICATIONS FOR DISABLED MEN.Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wishing to be trained, or from employers wishing to train such disabled men should be addressed to the Local War Pensions Committee for the area in which the applicant resides.PREPARATION OF THE REPORT.The Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour is especially indebted to Mr. J. Johnstone, Chairman of the Furniture Trade Advisory Committee, for his assistance in the preparation of this report, for his expert knowledge and for the time which he has devoted to visiting Technical Schools. The section dealing with training and the Syllabus are largely due to his experience.ENQUIRIES.Any questions upon which a Local War Pensions Committee may be in doubt should be referred by them to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W.I.Any suggestions or enquiries other than from a Local War Pensions Committee arising out of the technical matters dealt with in this Report should be addressed to the Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers), Employment Department, Ministry of Labour, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, West-minster, S.W.1.
