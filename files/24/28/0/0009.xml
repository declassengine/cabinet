p-^v   ^ ^ o  * s        *w fiie -The Prup^-^^^^My/022.DEPARmi^^ OF INFORMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLY    REPORT     ON    GERMANY 4th October,1917.1.      The chief interest of the events of the last few days has been tb&amp;t they show how impossible it is to penetrate the cloud of mis-statements and mis-representations with whioh the German Government surrouxtd themselves.     For some days the German press was full of articles which were clearly and - in some cases - avowedly inspired, dealing specifically with Belgium and discussing conditions on whioh Germany would be prepared to evacuate that country.     These conditions were:-(l)     That she would require the restoration of the GermanColonies and the repudiation of a commercial warafter the war, and (2)     Guarantees as to the Flemings and-as to German trade,especially with Antwerp. These were just the kind of conditions which Germany would obviously put forward as a basis on which negotiations could be; opened.     There were also quite definite statements to the effect that when the German answer to the Pope&apos;s Note was de-livered, Herr von Kiihlmann personally explained to the Papal Nuncio their attitude about Belgium.The Chancellor and Herr von ICttblmann have now both spoken in the Main Committee of the Reichstag.     They contradict the rumours of a German statement of terms for the evacuation of Belgium which had been assiduously circulated in the German press.     But it is to be noted that their contradiction is violent rather than explicit.     Herr von ICtthlmann says:
&quot;In the first place I -ill say a few words regarding the reports which appeared in this morning&apos;s newspapers that a German Hote existed regarding Belgium. It is one of the most jjnpuxLent inventions which have ever come before me in my political experience, and is probably of French origin. There is not a word of truth in the whole thing.&quot;It is to be observed that he contradicts the statement that thtrewas a note, while he does not contradict the statement, which wasmuch more v/idely circulated, that there had been a conversation;but the whole of his and the Chancellor1s speech is obviouslymeant to make people think for the present that there had beenno conversation and that there had been and was no intention todiscuss the Belgian question by itself.     It is much more prob-able, however, that the runours were correct, that some assurancewas verbally given and that the German Government for some reasonof its own is merely postponing the discussion which it-j&amp;tendsto begin at a time convenient to itself.However this may be, the. situation at this moment Is that the Chancellor and the Secretary for Foreign iiffairs are concorned in &quot;making an atmosphere, which, being interpreted, means that they are engaged in an attempt to persuade the world to revise its judgment on Gorcian^s responsibility for the war and on her general diplomatic methods.     Apparently they hope to be successful in this, and they think that the time will then oome to put forward their concrete proposals.This, so far as it goes, iB quite useful to us.    So long as they refuse any answer to the questions addressed to them by the Pope and by Mr. Asquith, no amount of vague expressions about Germany&apos;s love of peace will do them any good.     On the other hand, it is always in their power, by an apparently frank acceptance of the principle^ of the restoration of Belgium, to put the Allies, and especially Great Britain, in a position of some difficulty.     It would obviously be their wisest plan to manoeuvre so as to get Great Britain - or at any rate the British Press and public speakers - to discuss Belgium as an isolated
question, or at any rate, as a question connected solely with Anglo-German interests.     In this way they might use the Belgian question in a way which would cause uneasiness among the Allies, an uneasiness v/hich v/oula be fostered by every means in Germanyfs power, with a view to inducing the other Allies to suspect England of an inclination to consider a one-sided peace,2.      It still remains certain that the real difficultyis a fundamental difference of opinion in Germany.     There area large number of people who understand that the restoration ofBelgium is necessary.    As Theodor Wolff says in the BerlinerTageblatt of September 22:&quot;The decisive thing is and remains - Germany is on principle ready to restore the independence of Belgium.     Only people who have no suspicion of political necessities and have still less suspicion of the elementary principles of right, could wish for anything else, and only people who stagger past reality intoxicated with their own phrases, have believed in any other solution&quot;.There can be little doubt that Herr von Kuhlmann, who ftas plenty of knowledge and intelligence, himself knows this.     Of course a really great man, recognising this, would see that success in foreign policy, as in anything else, comes to the man who sees a great principle and has the strength and simplicity to adhere steadily to it.     Herr von Kuhlmann, how-ever, is probably influenced by the characteristic German belief that cunning is cleverness and that, for his own reputation among his countrymen, it is bettor to gain an end by a tortuous and devious side path than by going along the main road.     More-over, he is not in sole control, and he is perhaps not strong enough to insist on this against the opposition which it would arouse from the military and the Pan-Germans-     The latter, under the leadership of Tirpitz and Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg, are starting an agitation demanding the retention of Belgium.     Tirpitz, for instance, has said:   &quot;It is not wrong but right that has been done Belgium&apos;/ and &quot;it is necessary
to prove to the world that England has not &quot;beaten Germany&quot;, and, he added, this could only be done by the right solution of the Belgian question, i.e. a solution in the German sense. It is noteworthy that these expressions ujfore omitted in the report of the speech circulated by the German Wireless.     It is perfectly obvious that on this matter there is a fundamental opposition in Germany between the Groups who brought about the Reichstag resolution said the Chauvinist Groups, and this it is that is forcing Herr von Kflhlmann to hold his hand.3.       While this situation continues, it is becoming moreand more difficult to follow the tortuous details of thepolicy which Herr von Ktthlmann has initiated.     He has revertedto the methods of Prince Billow, which consisted in turning themanifestations of German parties and classes to account inorder to bamboozle both home and foreign opinion.     It usedto be erident to observers close at haqd that the instructionswhich the Chief of the Foreign Office Press Bureau, Dr. Hamann,received, were on those lines.     Translated into terms of thepresent situation, they would run:&quot;When a decision on a particular question has not yet been taken or announced, humour the different tendencies in the Press and give them the information you have to give with a concur which meets their respective views.     Thus, if the German Government is contemplating an attempt to induce the Allies to consider proposals for the evacuation of Belgium, with far-reaching guarantees^in Germany1s interest^let Reventlov. rave about annexation.     Let Liberal papers like the Berliner Tageblatt and the Mtbichner Heueste Nachrichten lay* stress upon the contemplated eventuality of evacuation rather than upon the conditions of it.     Then get the inter-mediate press, the Kfllnisobe  eitung, and perhaps even the Frankfurter, to emphasise in different degrees the ultimate conditions of evaluation.     Over it all spread a peace atmos-phere like that excellent article the other day (Sept.22) in the Frankfurter upon the military deadlock and the necessity for a compromise.     Yes, that is the kind of picture we want. Keep on reproducing and developing it every day until you cre-ate a stalemate or balance of opinion at home, if not abroad. There will then be a demand for a lead from the Government, and the decision of the Government when it comes will be accepted as a relief by the bulk of all save the extreme parties on either side, who, meanwhile, will have exhausted their arguments and will have been refuted again and again
not by the Government but by the Press and the speakers of the other parties.     The Government will thus get the credit for a plausible proposal and will escape the unpopularity of openly resisting the extreme parties, for it is a well-known fact that when the Government combais a particular Party, that Party attracts many malcontents from its immediate neighbourhood to its standard.&quot;This is what Ktihlmann end Michaelis have just beendoing with regard to the reply to the Pope&apos;s Note with particu-lar reference to Belgium.     They seem to have managed by thesemethods to obtain something like a free hand for the Government,and they may be able to placate all parties for a time by en-larging, as the Chancellor enlarged in his speech to the IsiainCommittee on Friday, upon the diplomatic advantage and expe-diency of a free hand with regard to each separate subject ofdispute.The following observation contained in the &quot;Times&quot; of October  , from a Special Correspondent at Amsterdam, is worth notice:&quot;Concerning the reported differences between Herr Michaelis and Herr von Kuhlmann, the suspicion is entertained here that no such differences really exist.     It is thought that the German Government is intentionally allowing the Press to cherish the notion of such differences for the purpose of enabling it (i.e. the Government) to pursue a temporising policy vis-a-vis of both the P---i-Germans and the Reichstag majority parties, and that Herr von Kiihlmann and Herr Micht-elis are in fact merely two sides of the same shield.,;We cannot say whether or not this is a true reading of the situa-tion;   however that may be, it well illustrates the impossibilityof getting back to real facts by deductionsfrom what the Germanpress says, or rather, is allowed or ordered to say.4.        The German plan seems then to be to take advantage of the desire for peace which prevails in all countries;   to bring about a revision of opinion as to Geroany^ original res-ponsibility for the war;   to depend on the support of those who would moderate the extreme indignation against German action which prevailed at the beginning of the war, trusting that this feeling has now expended its force;   to make people look to the future
rather than to the past, and to hold out hopes of common agree-ment among all nations on the general principles of better irk international relations put forward in the Pope&apos;s Note.     In this connection the speech of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Count Czernin, which appears in this morning&apos;s papers, is of great importance;   Germany and Austria would make it appear that it is they who invented and who are the chief sup-porters of the pacifist ideas.     When this &quot;Atmosphere&quot; has been created, they will then proceed cautiously, testing the ground as they go by means of informal &quot;conversations&quot; with the Vatican, the purport of which will be allowed to become known publicly, In this way they want to be able to bring about a general hope for a speedy peace;   the terms of any such peace would, under these conditions, probably not be difficult to arrange;   they would include the restoration of Belgium, a compromise over Alsace-Lorraine, the restoration of Serbia - even perhaps with some access to the sea - an independent pole ad and an indepen-dent Lithuania,     Of course the real effect of such a peace would be to leave Germany with practical control over the whole ox Central Europe, including the smeller Slavonic States, for it is quite obvious that whatever might &quot;be the constitutional and international arrangemexrts, they would be forced to depend almost entirely upon Germany and Austria, both commercially and finan-cially.     It is no doubt anticipated that, under these condi-tions, Germany would be able to maintain her hold over i-ustria; this of course is one of the real problems of the future.5.       During the last weeks we have received numerous reports as to the internal conditions of Germany coming from different sources.&apos;    There is no one statement which stands out among the others as being particularly reliable, but there is a general agreement.     All lay great stress on the very serious
aonditions produced not only by want of food bjtt by difficul-ties as to transport, the bad condition of the rolling stock on the railways, hardship caused by difficulty in getting clothing, boots, etc*i and the prospect during the winter of difficulties as to fuel-      The internal condition of the country is stead-ily deteriorating.     On the other hand there seems a general agreement that we cannot look forward to any effective revolt or more than the occasional strikes and disturbances which have been going on for some time.     All the most reliable information is to the effect that the people as a whole have become stupe-fied and incapable of any strong action, even if they wiBbed to take it.     we have heard singularly little about the Socialist Minority.     Whatever discontent there is, is for the moment being successfully kept down by the strictor control over the press, and it appears as though just at present the Government have stemmed the wave of pessimism which spread over the coun-try some three months ago, and have, for the moment apparently produced - largely by reports of imaginary victories on the western front - a feeling of confidence as to the situation on the different fronts.     How long this will last depends of course on the progress of the operations;   this comparative confidence is no doubt part of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; which they are trying to create, as it is essential to their   purposes that the peace negotiations which the:; are trying to bring about should be opened at a time when Germany seems to be getting on well.J.*V.H. G.S. 4 Oct. 1917.
