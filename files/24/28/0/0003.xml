THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT.SECRETG.T.2203. WAR   CABINET.Memorandum by the Rt. Hon. G. N. 3*me3 k.P.onState Regulation of Wages.The recent increases which have been demanded by and conceded to classes of workmen whoso labour is of vital import-3nee in the prosecution of the war tend to show that the system of regulation of wages by the State which has grown up during the pas$ three ye^irs is in danger of a breakdown.   The essence of the system is that no stop;o-!ge of, wor^ either through lockout or 3tri^e should be permissible in war time.     This system worked well on the whole during the first two years of the war, although the decision of the Government that piece r^tes were not to be cut, resulted in large wages being earned by individual workers and *,ave rise to a false impression of the prosperity of the working classes as a whole, as well as to discontent on the part of the skilled workmen whose wages were less although they supervised the work of the lesser skilled piecre workers.     But the rise in the cost of living has contin-ued so long and so progressively that deminds for increased v^ges, based on the enhanoed cost of living, have become more numerous and more insistent.     The relative success of such demands ha3 depended on the extent to which the claimant&apos;3 labour was essential to the State in the prosecution of the war, is will be seen from a comparison of the following examples of l^rge, medium and small increases which have been granted:-Large Increases.. The wages of iron ore miners in Cumberland, and blastfurnacemen and iron and steel millmen in various districts have risen, frequently by 70 to 80 per oent. on pre-war rates, npinly under the operation of sliling scales, in accordance with the selling price of steel.In the caBe of the unskilled workers in engineering, the war wage increase of 15s.per week means in many instances an increase of 75 to 80 per cent.Coal miners have received advances of between 30 and 50 per cent, in the principal districts and, in addition, an advance of IsSd. per shift under arrangements.Medium Increases.In the woollen and worsted industry, the usual increase,has been about 40 per cent, on piece rates and 50 per cent, on time rates.Small Increases. ,In the cotton industry the usual increase has been about 20 per cent, on piece rates; in. the hosiery trade 2 d.in/
in. tho shilling, which is less than 20 per cent; whilst in tho jute tnde it has counted to from 30 to 35.per cent on pre-w^r earnings.laying all industries toAether, the increases in rates of w-^gei would appear to r*.nge, in the great majority of cases, from about 20 per cent, up to SO or 70 per cent, and even 60 per cent,  in a few instances, the average being probably in the neighbourhood of 33 to 40 per cent.At the present time the restraining influence on wages which the employer exercised in pre-war days nas practically ceased to exist.     In the case of co *.l ijineri and raiJ/wiymen, no advances on commercial grounds can be justified, because both these services not only mai^e no commercial profit but are only Kept alive by subsidies from the State.      In the munitions factories,  so long as the margin of profit left to him by the Excess Profits Tax is preserved, the employer has no interest in limiting wao.es.In trades,which are not r^mreti as munitions trades, both employers and workmen have the greatest difficulty in keeping the trade alive at all, owitftf to the narrowing of markets and the ever diminishing supplies of material. The question of w^ges is not acute in these trades from the point of view of the State;     but it naturally engenders gre^t bitterness in the minds of the workers in thosetrades when they find themselves unable to participate in advances to the game extent as those engaged in more vit^l industries.J!?J ViJV? C ojbj^jo f J^ijrin^.Differences in cost of living have for many years been recognised as a factor in the determination of wages. Venations in the district rates have been attributed to such differences, although there is little doubt that the real cause in many cages has been not tho difference in the cost of living; but the difference in the strength of the worirmen&apos;s organisations in the various localities.     At the present time, when the cost of liying has rison to a height previously unrnown, it is regarded as a perfectly sound justification for demands made for increased wages.    Probably it is true, as an economic abstraction, that the rising cost of living i   not only not checked, but is actually stimulated by the constant granting of increases in wages;   but that does not -alter the fact -chit an increase in w^gos is the only me ins whereby a worj.ou.an can cope with tho increased cost of e s 3 e nti* 1 c ommodit i e s.The regulation of the prices of essential commod-ities, such as bread, meat and milr, and the limitation of prices of coal by tho State will no doubt do something to prevent the cost of living rising to a prohibitive- extent; but it will not operate to prevent any furthor increase, for universal items in the worj-ing-class budget, such as rent for lodgings, clothes, clesiing materials etc., will continue to rise in price owing to the scarcity of those commodities and thU3 the artificial lowering of prices will to some extent be neutralised.
Ho easy solution is possible.     A hard andfast rule as to the limit abenre pre-war rates beyond which coaoes-slxms will not bo ma&amp;e by the Government cannot be laid downt     It is possible to fix suoh a limit - and in fact the Committee&apos;on Production, did so, on the theory that the lower the wwjs earned before the war; the higher the increase which, can now be justifiably claimed - but as i.t is impossible to predict how high the cost of living will rise, so it seems diffi-cult for the Government to draw a line beyond which no Concessions will be granted,..At some stage the Government may have to ma]r a stand and refuse to grant a demand for a general in-crease, even at tho rislc of prolonging the war by bringing about a serious strilce.     Now tlUt tho mi^rs have obtained their increase and other demands nre 7&apos; likely to be conceded in tho near future, a dcflait^--^ statement of policy might be made..   The recent modest increases in soldiers5 pay might be used as an argument^ against a further general advance to certain sections &apos; of tho industrial c0minimi.ty,who havo already had the greatest advances.   Reference might bo made to national sentiment, and comparison made between recent advances made to the nation&apos;s defenders and tho30 to industrial interests at home.    Oh this ground it misjht be urged tho nation cannot afford to pay further&apos; increases to the latter.     A short respite is all that can be obtained&quot; by this means, unless the total 00st of living ccasc3 its&apos; upward trend.G. 1*.
