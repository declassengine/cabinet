Urban District Council to request poll to bring to the notice of the members of the War Cabinetthe Council, viz(a).   &quot;THAT having regard to the increasing intensity of the aerial attacks on London and Suburbs by enemy aircraftand the obvious need of giving the people reasonable opportunity to seek shelter as required by the Authorities, this Council is strongly of opinion that immediate steps should be&apos;taken by the Authorities to institute public warning of an impending raid during such hours as are not already provided for.     And for this purpose reiterates its proposal to utilise either a siren on the Town Hall or a coloured globe indicating to the people either &quot;danger&quot; or &quot;safety&quot; and that application be made immediately for permission find all necessary steps taken and notices issued by the responsible officers of the- Council&quot;.(b)      &quot;THAT this Council deeply regrets that no action has yet been taken by the Government for an immediate and determined attack on German towns and cities as reprisals for the attacks on London and other places..     Thereforef it confirms the following resolution on this matter passed on June 19th, 1917, namely&quot;&quot;THAT this Council hereby expresses its&apos; utter abhorrence of &quot;the German method of warfare by the murder of innocent women and &quot;ohildren in air raids on open towns and cities, and is of opinion &quot;that the only means of bringing the inhumanity and cruelty of &quot;these dastardly criminal attacks home to the German people is by &quot;systematic&apos;and ruthless reprisals.      It, therefore,  calls on the &quot;Government to initiate immediately a policy of ceaseless air &quot;attacks on German towns and cities, in order that their populations &quot;may experience the effects of sue)&apos;-, methods of warfare, and thus &quot;be induced to force the German authorities to cease this wanton &quot;and useless destruction of life and property;     THAT conies cf the &quot;resolution be sent to the King, the Prime Minister, the Members of &quot;the War Cabinet, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary &quot;for War, and the Lord Mayor of London&quot;.the following resolution which was passed at the 1ast Meeting ofI am,  -c(Signed)    REGIFALL C.
