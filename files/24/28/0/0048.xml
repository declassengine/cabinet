(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)

SECRET.

From Assistant Military Attache.

To D.M.I.

Petrograd.

5th October, 1917.

No. 1382.

It is stated by officer from south western front that men openly declare that in October they will leave the trenches.  All the officers of the Chevalier Guards* have been turned out by the Men&apos;s Committees.  I am informed that Kefenski has sent an ultimatum to committees, saying the regiment Will he disbanded if the officers are not taken back. This regiment would seem superfluous anyhow, now that Russia is a republic.

Discipline on south western front has got very bad since Korniloff&apos;s failure. Germans taking advantage of this are endeavouring to renew fraternisation. The Ussuri, Kuban and Terek Cossacks divisions which were sent to Petrograd by Korniloff are still outside Petrograd and they are ready, I am informed, to take on any Bolshevik rising.  In Tachkent martiai law has been proclaimed. Reports of disgraceful disturbances come from many places in Central Russia. Estates, crops and forests are being destroyed. Complete anarchy prevails. A general railway strike is to be declared if mens demands not satisfied by midnight October 5th. Kerenski has issued a declaration stating that the Government will not allow it but the Government is quite powerless to prevent it.

At Dvinsk there are signs of German activity. General Boldirov? states in Army Order issued by him that men retiring without fighting will not be allowed to cross the Dvinsk bridge.

* 1st Regiment of the Guard Cavalry.

* General Boldirov commands the 5th Army.
