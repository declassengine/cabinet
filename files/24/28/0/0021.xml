Hot more than four thousand people were at meeting of Yrtiom not more than half were men.   He considered there was a lack cf enthusiasm in the proceedings.    The marching with bands was such as commonly occurs in   connection with organised attendance from outlying districts. The inscriptions on the walls ?/ere the remains of those put up in paint or   tar during the recent election.    County Inspector adds;&quot;I regard the Daily Kail reports as so exaggerated as to be unworthy of notice except so far as they may mislead the English public&quot;.I have seen this morning another Constabulary Officer who is thoroughly conversant with the situation in Clare and am satisfied that the view of the County Inspector can be unreservedly accepted.
