Aw . his s?&quot;itaori!c ;f  :?Si?*:  circulated by the secretary of state for india. secret.My dear Curzon, 28th September 1917.My view of the employment of Japanese troops is different from my view of the employment of Chinese troops, for the former have a real military value, and therefore if they are employed in sufficient numbers, I cannot argue that we are not doing something to aid our prospects of military success.But I have strong political objections to the employment, of Japanese in Asia, or with Indian troops, and these objections are certainly not fanciful, even if they are not conclusive.The employment of Japanese troops in itself, makes me less apprehensive than consideration of the price which we may have to pay for Japanese assistance and of the footing which the Japanese would secure in Mesopo-tamia. The claims of the Japanese in Asia are well known, and have been emphasised by my predecessor ; everything that I hear leads me to feel that these aims are growing in Japan. There are already indications of Japanese attempts at commercial penetration in the Persian Gulf (besides those we know of in India), and we may be sure that the Japanese Government would use any weapon that came to hand in furtherance of their aims. Commercial influence in the Gulf leads inevitably to political influence, and it is clearly not in our interests to encourage a new rival. We do not want the J apanese, for instance, to endeavour to obtain concessions for settlements at Basra and Baghdad, or to establish a line of steamers and subsidised export companies in the Persian Gulf.Further, it must be remembered that our policy is a policy of &quot; Mesopo-tamia for the Arabs,&quot; and in pursuance of this we feel that we shall ,have to restrict Indian immigration after the war to Mesopotamia within very narrow limits. This will not be easy in any case, having regard to the part played by Indian troops in the Mesopotamia^ campaign, but the difficulty of closing the door to Indians will be sensibly increased if we find ourselves compelled to hold it open to Japanese.I now take the analogy suggested by you of France and Tsingtao. As regards France, it differs from Mesopotamia in that I faucy that the latter is regarded popularly, as an &quot; Indian show.&quot; India has furnished the majority of the troops, and has served throughout as the base of supply, &amp;c The country has always had close connections, commercial, religious, &amp;c, with India, and falls geographically within the area usually regarded as the sphere of India&apos;s external relations.Before the war the British Consul-General at Baghdad was normally an officer of the Indian Political Department, and bore in addition to his Consular designation the Indian title of &quot; Resident &quot; in Turkish Arabia. It is hardly too much to say that the Mesopotamian operations have excited greater general interest in India and have been regarded more in the light of a domestic concern than those in any of the other great theatres of war. In these circumstances the employment of Japanese troops in &apos; Mesopotamia seems to me open to the same objections as those urged against the use of Chinese troops at Aden. It has already been rumoured that we intend to use Japanese troops to help us to maintain order in India itself. I would hesitate to do anything that might give these rumours colour, and I do think that the presence of Japanese might affect not only the Indians, but the Arabs.As regards Tsingtao, surely the Japs hope that they will keep that for themselves. I do not want them to think the same thing in a smaller degree of Mesopotamia.As I have admitted the military value of the Japanese, I can only ask that these political considerations shall be taken into account when the military question is being decided.Yours sincerely, The Right Hon. Edwin IS. Montagu.The Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G.
