To     D.M.I.Petrograd. 7th October, 1917.12B8.Representatives of Don Cossacks have been summoned by War Minister to know why they refuse to comply with orders to proceed to Turkestan to put down the revolt there.    Reply was that they are tired of being called counter revolutionaries and followers of Kornilov merely because they have so far carried out Government orders.     If Government insist on using them to put down mutiny they demand that infantry should also accompany them.    He also asked them why 2 Cossaok divisions were kept in Don district.    They replied that the reserve regiments stationed there had behaved so disgracefully that it had been necessary to send 8 regiments there in Order that the Cossacks at the front should know their property and families were being looked after. Owing to continual accusations being hurled at the Cossaeks by Socialists, they are at present in a very disturbed state.
