Department of Information. Intelligence Bureau.    (SectionE)Special^Memorandum.The Nationality Problem in the Caucasus.(i)   The Geographical Area.Before the Russian Revolution, there was a viceroy f\f the Caucasus at Tiflie, who exercised a general control, on the Tsar^ behalf, over all governments, provinces and districts of the Russian Empire south of the line Azov-Astrakhan.     The territory thus defined Is bounded on other sides by the Caspian 3ea, the Persian and Turkish frontiers, the^ Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and traversed diagoaally from N.W. to S,E. - by the Caucasus Range.     These m&amp;Uiitains are only crossed by the. &apos; Vladikavkaz - Tiflie Chausee (which bisects them) and the railway to Baku, which runs along the Caspian Coast, and they divide Caucasia into two distinct geographical regions.The Caucasus is thus a rather artificial administrative unit.    It isroughly identical with the Russian acquisitions, in this quarter, during the last 130 years.    Before 1703 the Russian frontier ran along the rivers Kuban and Terek, in the Cis-Caucasian steppes.     In 1783 the Kingdom of Georgia, south of tho mountains, united itself voluntarily with the Russian Empire.     The remaining Trans-Caucasian territories were conquered from Persia and Turkey, in a series of wars between 179ft and 1878.     The indopendent tr^lbes separating :       Georgia from the original Russian frontier were pacified or laboriously exterminated from 1815 to 1868.The population of the territory rounded off by these successive acquisitions is now about 13,000,000 divided among the following nationalitiesUkrainians, Great Russians, Cossacks      about 4.5 million. Georgians (Christians - Orthodox Church     &quot;     2.0      &quot; Other indigenous races (Moslems) &quot;    1.5      &quot;Iranians:- Ossetes, Tates, Persians (Moslems) ..5 &quot; Tatars (Moslems   - Shia and Sunni) abflut 2.5      &quot;Armenians (Christians - Gregorian) &quot;     2.0      &quot;Totalabout      13.0 million.
Cf thses the Cossacks, Great Russians and Ukrainians may he dis-!P.issed from this survey.     They form a compact block of population, partly in the extreme north, which was Russian before 1783F. and partly in the adjoining country, south of the Kuban, which was once Circassian They are in immediate geographical contact with the Ukraine and European Russia, and will share their political destiny.     Their ad-ministrative inclusion in the Caucasus Is purely artificial.On the other hand, there are territories beyond the southern frontiers which have been divided from the Causasus artificially, in spite of the strongest natural bonds.     The Tatars and Armenians, the two most numerous nationalities in the Caucasus when the Russians of the Ilorth are left out of account, stretch beyond the frontiers, into Persla and Turkey.     Before the deputations of 1915,the Ottoman Armenians constituted fully half the total of the Armenian nation. The Tatars in the Persian province of Azerbaijan probably number between one and two millions - there are no statistics - and are only*separated from the Caucasus Tatars by the River Aras,     The Azerbaijani Tatars end Ottoman Armenians, in turn, are closely involved with two other nationalities - the Assyrians (Hestorians) and the Jlurds.The political frontier which separated this Armenian - Kurdish -Nestorian zone of Turkey and Persia from the Caucasus has been broken d?wn by theater,     The greater part of this zone has been occupied militarily by the Russian Army, and it has been affected like tho Caucasus by the Russian Revolution.The Revolution has swept away the foreign, semi-military regime of the Russian Viceroy at Tiflis and left the nationalities face to*    The Cossack e^eelements on the Terek date from the 16th century.-
face.   The problem of the Caucasus, since the Revolution, has re-solved itself into the problem of all the nationalities which liwe between the Ukrainian and Great Russian area on the north and theArab area on the south.x2)    The Nationalities.Among the innumerable tribes and tongues of the Caucasian area, only three nationalities have yet attained political immrtance -the Georgians, Tatars and Armenians,-(a)   The Georgians, (about 2 millions]   are a compact isolated nationality.     They cccupy a triangle of territory between the Black Sea, the Cauoasus Range, and the parallel of Tiflis.     They have no kinsmen, even among the indigenous Caucasian peoples, except the Adshars and Lazes, S.W. of them, who are insignificant and are divided from them by religion.     The Adshars and Lazes are Moslems, the Georgians Christians of the Greek Orthodox Church..Prom the 5th Century A.P. to 1783 Georgia maintained herself, with a few breaks of continuity as an independent Christian Kingdom. In 1783 the last Georgian King, unable to hold his own any longer against the great Moslem States of Turkey and Persia, turned to Russia, the ohambioh of Greek Orthodoxy, and invited her to oooupy the country.   A treaty was signed between the two governments, by which Georgia was to. s*Bfcender her sovereignty but to retain ooliti-oal and ecclesiastical autonomy.     In 1801. however, Georgia was mefcged, administratively and ecclesiastically, in the Russian State.The Georgians accepted this for about a century.     The ecclesiastical union aroused no religious prejudice, because both national churches professed the same creed.     Politically, the massThe interaction of these nationalities is increasing.   Por instance, the Tatar.press at Baku is now taking an interest -    in the Kurds of Turkish Armenia.
of the Georgian people were content with the security Russian rule had brought;    and the landed nobility derived positive advantages from it,for the Tsardom offered them careers in the Russian Army and xBureaucracy, and protected their interests as a class.   Georgia seemed oii the road to voluntary Russification;   but Russification brought with it education, a press and a new political life.     A Georgian intelli-gentsia gasww up, Georgian political parties were founded in the Revolution of 1904 - 6, and these fell into two divergent groups.On the one side are the Georgian Social Democrats and Socialu.Revoltionary parties, -neiielled on the Russian parties of the same name, and working in the closest connection with them.     They represent on the left wing the same tendency towards assimilation with Russia whcih the Georgian aristocracy stands for on the right, and just as under the Tsardom Georgian princes became Russian generals and gover-nors, so since the Revolution Georgian Socialist leaders like Cheidze and Tseretelli have come to the fore in the Pterograd C.W.S.D.     But like the aristocrats, the Georgian socialists, though prominent, individually, have no large following among the Georgian people&apos;. Georgia is too backward and too little industrialised to be a good field for socialisms and so the most distinguished Georgian Socialists have become absorbed in Russian politics, v/hile the aristocrats have lost their power altogether with the fall of the Tsarelorn, and will&apos; only recover it in the event of an extreme reaction.For instance the Governor of Baku who was morally reponsible for the racial war between the Tatars and Armenians in 1905 - 6 was a Georgian aristocrat - Prince $fakashidze\     He was simoly carrying out the contemporary policy of the Russian Government.-f^ kIt is worth noting that Che^hengeli, the Georgian Social Democrat cn the Duma Commission for the southern Caucasus (which since the Revolution has replaced the Viceregal government) has never,been a member of the Petrograd C.V/.S.D.&apos;, and was in the Caucasus s&apos; the time of the Revolution.
I    i 4 &amp; 3 &amp;- 5 -On the other side - in contrast both to the assimilationistsocialists and the assimilationist nobility - stand the Georgiannationalist parties, the conservative National Democrats and the moreliberal Social Federalists (said to have a larger following than anyother party din Georgia)     Georgian nationalism rests on (a) therecentness of the national revival, producing an exaggeration cfnational consciousness;    (b)   the long history of Georgia&apos;s nationaland sfcnly ended 130 years ago independence, which lasted thirteen centuries with hardly a break; /and (c)   the treaty with Russia in 1783, guaranteeing the politicaland ecclesiastical autonomy of Georgia with the Russian Empirei whichhas been violated by the Russian Government but never Invalidated.The Georgian nationalist narties have thus a legal right, likethe Ukrainians, Finns, and Poles of the Congress Kingdom (RussianPoland) as well as a historical tradition.     In their manifesto sincethe Revolution they have based their claims on both, and on bothcounts they have a far stronger case than the other nationalities ofthe Caucasus.     The Tatars, for example, have no political past at althe last independent Armenian principality ( and that was far away inCilicia ) was extinguished more than five cneturies ago;   and theTatar, and Armenian populations of the Caucasus came under Russian rul-not by any compact between Russia and themselves, but by cessions of territory to Russia on the part of Persia and Turkey.     The Georgians on the ather hand, have positive rights, retained from a recent peric of political independence, and their national autonomy within the Russian Empire could be restored without any alteration of existing international frontiers, since the whole nation lives in Russian territory.But there is one weak point in the Georgian&apos;s position - they are too small a nation to stand alone - and since the nationalists
ht U Ureject the solution of assimilation with the Russians, which woul&amp; obliterate Georgian nationality altogether, they must make an en-tente with some other nationality, as far as possible on equal terms; the choice lies between the Armenians and tho Tatars, and so far the Georgians have inclined more towards the latter, (b)     The Tatars (about  .500.000)   offer a contrast to the Georgians in many respects.     The Georgians have been in the Caucasus since the prehistoric period;   the Tatars have drifted in gradually be-tween the 11th and 15th centuries A*IL   The Georgians have had an in-dependent national kingdom;   the Tatars have always been engulfed in great foreign empires - the Seljuk Empire, the Mongol Empire, the modern Persian Empire - before they came under Russia.     The Tatars are considerably behind the Georgians in education and organisation. The Georgian political parties date from 1904;    the Tatars have cn-ly begun to take political aotion since March 1917.   Finally, the Georgians are united ecclesiastically, while the Tatars, though all Moslems, are divided between the hostile Shia and Sunni sects.On the other hand, the Tatars have better prospects tham the Georgians for the future.     Georgia i3 a very psor country, while the Tatar territory contains the oil-fields of Baku.   The oil-industry hasjbeen stained by   Foreign enterprise, and the Tatars have participated in it, to: begin with, chiefly as unskilled lebourerSc But the rise of the industry has brought the Tatars prosperity, and there are already at Baku the beginnings of a Tatar intelligentsia. Baku Tatars have taken a leading part in the All Russia Moslem Movement since the Revolution.Again, while the Georgians are an isolated nation, the Tatars have potential links, through their Turkish language and Mohammedan religion, with large populations, near and distant, both inside the Russian frontiers and beyond them.     These are:-\
1.     The non-Tatar Caucasian Moslems   (indigenous about 1.500,000, Iranians about 500,000)   The Caucasian Moslems, in combination, out-number the Georgians and Armenians addec&quot; together;   and a congress of all Caucasian Moslems, under (Tatar auspices, met at Baku as early as&quot; April 28th 1917.o2.     The (Tatars, df Azerbaijan,;   (1.00;.000 - 2.000.000) at present under the influence of Persian culture, but bound to gravitate towards Baku,3.    Then $fords of Turkey:   The $atar press of Baku has sided vigor-oudly with the Kurds in the Kurdo-Armenian conflict in the occupied territory.4.    (The Ottoman Turks.of Anatolia and Constantinople,   (about ,8,000.000)   These are separated from the Cabatjisus (Tatars by the Armenians, but bound to them by a common anti-Armenian interest.    Owing to their proximity and prestige, their literary language has bsen adopted by the Caucasus Tatars for their press.    This is a very important bond,5.    The, Tatars of Crimea. Kazan and Astrakhan, and the ffurkish-epiaklng peoples of Central Asia,   (about 15.000.000 altogether, in-oludlng Chinese Turkestan)    Deputies from Kazan and Russian Turkestan attended the Baku Conference of April 28th;   and the Caucasus Tatars, in turn, sent represenatives to. the All-RuesIa Moslsm Conference at Moscow on May 14th.The Caucasus Tatars realise that their future depends on b*ld or-ganisation.    The Baku Conference passed a resolution in favour of a &quot;democratic Russian Republic on the territorial-federative principle&quot;; but they also demanded the oreation of a central organisation for all Russian Moslems, &quot;to exercise legislative functions&quot;.    Before dispers-ing they &amp;i&amp;o appointed three permanent bureaux - one for the Northern Caucasus, one for the south, and the third &quot;to consider all problems of Pan-Islamism and establish communications&quot;   (between the different Moslem groups in Russia).
2CK&apos;But though the Tatars have much more to gain by extensive organi-sation than the other nationalities in the Caucasus, their comparative backwardness also makes them less capable of achieving it.     The breakt. /Try-: .,   - .&quot;between Shias and Sunnis is sure to open again, and the question of the emancipation of women is causing serious friction between the progressives and the Mohammedan ecclesiastics.(c)    The Armenians,    (about  .000.000 in Russia) are in a differentposition again.   Like the Georgians, they are indigenous in theCaucasus;   the province of Kars, the government of Erivan, and theKarabagb district of the government of Velisavetppl are ancient .Armenian territory.    Ani, near Kars, was the capital of the chiefmedieval Armenian principality,,and Etchefiiadzin. close to Arivan,has been for fifteen centuries the seat of the Katholikos - the headoi the whole Armenian national church.     But even in these territoriesthe Armenians do not form a compact population.     Eastward they havebeen penetrated and broken&amp;up by the Tatars, while northward they havethemselves trespassed on Georgian ground - especially during the lastcentury, when Armenian refugees from Turkey have crossed the frontierin tens of thousands after every Russo-Turkish War and every massacrecommitted by the Turks and Kurds.     These migrations of landlessArmenians, combined with the superiority which the Armenians have sofar possessed over the other nationalities of the Caucasus in com-raerce and industry, have made them the dominant ileraent in the urbanpopulation;   Tiflis, for example, the Georgian capital, has become axsemi-Armenian city;   and there has been a greater influx than ever during the present war.     The number of new Armenian refugees from Turkey to j the Cauoasus has risen to 250.000 since the systematic atrocitiesinaugurated by the CU.P. in 1915.About 160.000 Armenians out of a total population of 330.000.
In Turkey, too, where half the Armenians&quot;lived, they were scattered among alien populations - in this case Turks and Kurds. Only in parts of the vilayet of Van and cf the Cilician highlands were they in an absolute majority, and the deportations and massacres Wot 1915 have uprooted them altogether.     Out of about 2.000.000 Armenians in Turkey before the War, the colonies at Constantinople and Smyrna alone have been soared.     About 250,000 have found shelter behind the Russian front;   ahout 60^,000 have been brought alive to places of exile in Northern Mesopotamia and Syria;   the rest have been killed or converted forcibly to Islam.     Since the rate of mortality among the exiles is very high (many of them are starving to death), it is possibly that not more than three-quarters of a million Ottoman Armenians, less than half of the original number, may survive the War.The balance of numerical strength between the Armenians, Tatarsand GepJogians, is thus being altered violently.   The Tatars, sinoe thevResolution, have begun to open up extensive connections with their kinsmen and oo-religioniets in other parts of Russia;   the Armenians, who before the Y/ar were as numerous, in Turkey and Russia together, as 11 the Moslems in the Caucasus, and twice as numerous as the Georgians, have been struck a blow in Turkey which has destriyed nearly a third of the whole Armenian race.     The Georgians have not lost, and have no possibility of gaining.The Armenians have two points in oomroon with the Jews - their extreme dispersion, and their general superiority in education, in-3-ustry and enterprise over the populations among whom they live;   and this has made them both weak and strong.     They have been disliked and feared by their neighbours, and are defenceless against their attacks.    But when they have been uprooted in one place they have struck fresh root in another, and the prosperous Armenians abroad
a 0 *78  10-jiave always maintained solidarity with the Armenians in Hussia and Turkey.     In^stimating the relative strength of the Armenians,. Georgians and Tatars in the Caucasus area, one must set against the Ottoman Armenians who have been destroyed, the Armenian colonies in Ispahan, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Alexandria, Cairo, Philippopolis; Lemberg, Trieste, Venice, London, Manchester, Hew York and Chicago. These are well-organised commercial communities, with a considerable influence in the countries in which they live - especially in India, Egypt and the United States.     The American-Armenians have also behind them the important American missionary interest, for Turkish Armenia has been one of the principal American missionary fe/illda.     In fact, the Armenians possess already that world-wide organisation which the Tatars are only just attempting under severe handicaps to build up.   Above all, the Armenians have a press in Europe and America such as is possessed hy no other &quot;Caucasian nationality.Ecclesiastically, the Armenians are at a certain disadvantage, for while the Georgians and Tatars belong to two great international religious bodies - the Orthodox Churoh and Islam - the Armenian national Church! ^e Gregorian Churoh) has been out of communion with the rest of Christendom since the 5th century A.D.   On the other hand, the Armenian Roman Catholic Community (dating from the 14th century) and the Armenian Protestant Churohes (founded by the Americans in the 19th century) have brought the Armenians into intimate connection with Western civilization, without breaking the political unity of the Armenian nation.     In the divorce of religion from politics, the Armenians are a long way ahead of their neighbours.     The Tatars are actually building their political organisation on the basis of Islam, and not of the *W-Tatar language.     The Georgians are only just abandoning the basis of Orthodoxy, which was merging them in Russia, and demanding a national Georgian Church and State.     The Armenians, on the other hand,
43 (\ 0 630have never let religious differences interfere with their national politios.     Their organised politioal parties date from the last quarter of the 19th century, and have developed on individual lines:-(1)    Hinohaklstg (&quot;Social Democratic Revoltionaries&quot;J:   Founded 1883;   anti-Ottoman;   terrorist;   ineffectual;   &quot;broke up in 1903. (2)    Baghnakjgts (Revolutionaries&quot;)   or Dashnakzutiun Party: Founded 1&amp;90;   well-organised, with bureaux at Geneva and Tiflis; started anti-Ottoman, &quot;but began to take action against the Russian Government also in 1003.(The Dasnakists were driven into opposition to the Russian Government by the Government&apos;s oppressive policy.     The Armenians had welcomed the Russians when they first appeared in the Caucasus, and fought voluntarily on their side in every Busso-Persian and Russo-Turkish War, as they bav* done in the present War;   the Russians on their part had promised the Armenians eoclesiastical and even political autonomy.     But when as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 18 6 - 6, Etohmiadzin, the seat of the Armenian Katholikos, was brought within the Russian frontiers, the Russian Government took advantage of this in 1836, to promulgate an organic statute restrict-ing the self-government of the Armenian Cburoh.     In 1884, during the reaction under Alexander III, Armenian schools were suppressed;   and in 1903 the late T3&amp;r confiscated, by decree, the Armenian Church and School property in the Caucasus.     This was what drove the Dashnakists to take active steps.)In 1904 - 5 the Dashnakists attended a secret congress at Moscow of all the nationalities in the Russian Empire, and this led t* the adoption of a socialistic programme, modelled, like the programmes of the new Georgian socialist parties, on the principles of the Suesian Social Democrats - nationalisation of land and means of production, and self-determination of nationalities within a federal    )
o 1299;ussian Republic.     The introduction of these socialist principles w aused dissention within the Dashnakist Party, and as a compromise &quot;t was agreed that they should only be applied to RussAa^.and not to urkish Armenia.During the first Russian Revolution there was a racial war in the Caucasus between the Armenians and the Tatars - from February 1905 to March 1906 - which the Russian Government took no 3teps to stop, and probably even promoted.     In this struggle the Dashnakists organised the Armenian forces,     In August 1905 the Tsar repealed the confisca-tion decree, but the breach between the Russian Armenians and the Tsardom remained.Meanwhile,the Bashnaklsts continued their activities in Turkey. Mioy organised the resistance to the Hamiiian atrocities of 1894 - 6 (against vQiich the Russian Government declined to take action), and made common cause against the Hamidian regime with the CU.P. who ivere then in exile with their headquarters at P^ris.When the Revolution of 1908 brought the &amp;.V.P. into power in Turkey, the Dashnckists too became a constitutional instead of a revolutionary party there.     They cooperated with the C.U.P. in the elections and in parliament.     during the- counter-revolution of 1909, certain Dashnafclsts saved CO&quot;,P.leader&apos;s live3.     Officially, D&amp;shnakEutlun and the CU.P. were in parliamentary coalition from 1$C8 t- 1915.     The Dashnakista had thus gravitated towards Turkey and away from Russia.     Between 1908 and 1915 they were actually banned by the Russian Government and recognised by the Turkish, but their position has been completely reversed since then b y three events:- (o) the refusal of the Dashnakzutiun Congress at Erzeaum in the Autumn of 1914 to raise volunteers for tCTEXx&apos;Enver&apos;s invasion of Russia;    (b)   the campaign of extermination against the Armenians in Turkey, organised by
the C.U.P. in the spring of 1915;   and (c)   the Russian Revolution of this year, which has opened to the Dashnakists the possibility of carrying out their socialist-federalist orogramme for Russian Armenia.Dashnakzutiun is not only the strongest Armenian political party, both in Russia and Turkey,     It is the oldest; most experienced and best organised party of any on the Caucasus.3.   Constitutional Democrats (&quot;Cadets&quot;) Originally the &quot;Armenia&quot; Party, but reorganised under the new name in 1901;   represents the (urban, commercial) propertied class among the Russian Armenians; said to have the support of most Armenians of the Dispersion;   de-mand8 autonomy for Turkish Armenia under the protection of the Powers; sharply opposed to the Dashnakistg&apos; socialist programme for Russian Armenia.Since the Russian Revolution the Constitutional Democrats have been reinforced by a new &quot;Armenian People&apos;s Party&quot;, which is more definitely anti-sociilist.Since the Revolution, the Armenian parties in the Caucasus, incontrast to the Georgians and Tatars, have refrained from committingxthemselves by action or manifesto.   Several reasons can be suggested for this reserve:-1.    Unlike the Georgians, the Armenians in Russia have no nublic document on which to base their claims^     There has been no indepen-dent Armenian State within the present limits of the Russian Caucasus since 1079 A.D.;   no independent Armenian State in the world since   -1375.     The relation of the Russian Armenians to the Russian Govern-ment arises out of treaties made, over the Armenians1 heads, between Hussia on the one hand and Persia and Turkey on the other, xA manifesto has been issued so far only by the comparatively un-important &quot;People&apos;s Party&quot;,
2.   At the same time the Armenian national claims, againmnlike the eorgian, are not a purely internal question of the Russian Empire, or there is also the Armenian question in Turkey, and that is inter-ational, on two accounts:-   (a) because certain reforms are guaranteed to the Six Armenian Vilayets of the Ottoman Empire &quot;by the signatories of the Treaty of Berlin;   and (b) because a large portion of these vacayets has been occupied bQr the Russian Army during the present War.     The destiny of this occupied territory, and the liquidation of these olauses in the Treaty of Berlin, which have never yet been given effect, can only be settled by the Peace Conference, at the end of the War, while the Georgian and Tatar claims can be settled definitely by the forthcoming Russian Constituent Assembly.3.   There are grave differences between the Dashnakists and Constitutional Democrats oh social policy, which will become acute as soon as action is taken by either.     But in view of the blow the nation has just suffered in the atrocities in Turkey and the tendency towards an Entente between the Tatars and Georgians, the Armenian parties feel it essential to maintain a united national front, even at the cost of inactivity.     If they hold r-n, there are inany chances of the situation becoming more favourable to the Armenians than it is at present.It is not easy to analyse the national Armenian policy beneath the party differences.     All Armenian parties naturally rejoice at the fall of the Tsardom.     The Tsardom (like Abd-ul-Eamid and latterly the C.U.P.) singled out the Armenians for repression, because they were for long the only nationality in the Caucasus which Russia did n3t feel herself able either to assimilate or to ignore.     But the Tsardom being disposed of, there are indications that the Armenians, as a nation, incline mure towards the Russian Cadets than towards the Russian
socilist groups - and this net on grounds of social policy (6n which the Armenians are just as sharply divided) &quot;but on the question of national autonomy.The Armenians would obviously gain by a thorough-going self-determination of nationalities within a federal Russian republic, but proportionately the other nationalities would stand to gain mere. The Georgians and Tatars, who have lagged behind the Armenianspolitically for centuries, would overtake them at one stride.     And ifx lthe formula of &quot;no annexations or indemnities&quot; , as well as &quot;self-determination&quot;, were carried out strictly, Armenia would be particm partitioned permanently between tfe^e- two states;    the ruin wrought in Turkish Armenia in 1915 would be left without reparation;   and one half cf the Armenian nation would be abandoned to complete destruction.These are considerations which may weigh with the   rmenians against supporting Kerensky.     Miliukev, on the other hand, spoke very warmly about Armenia before the Revolution, and seemed to entertainthe idea of a United Armenia, like a tThited Poland, gathered as an^  X2autonomous State into the Russian Empire.     The Armenians, in fact, are as likely (or more likely) to obtain unity and autonomy from the Russian Cadets as from the Russian Socialists, and they would be at an advantage because the other nationalities would gain less. Miliukov is liberal towards Poland,    jealous of granting the politi-oai claims of the Ukraine, because Poland is an outlying country, half outside the present frontiers of Russia, while the Ukraine lies geographically near Russiars heart.     If he acted tn the same principlexlThough there is no reason to suppose thot the Russian socialist Parties apnly this to Turkish Armenia.x Miliukov has since accepted the idea of a completely independent Poland, like the Russian Socialists.
O A OxIn the case of the Ukraine other considerations come in besides the geographical one.     There are many people in the Ukraine who feel them-selves Russian politically9 and call themselves Jugo-Rossi(South Russians).    Again, the steppe-provinces along the netth-eaet of the Black Sea, whi*h have largely been opened up and settled in the last half-century, contain a very mixed population.     Odessa, for example, is not an Ukrainian town.in the Caucasus , his generosity towards the Armenians would probably not extend to the Georgians and Tatars.     The Armenians would get what they want;    the ether national movements would be nipped in fche bud.This is nojmere than a conjecture, based on certain Armenian ex-pressiens of opinion concerning curre$n\ Russian politics.     The Armenians have net chosen yet to give their policy away.9. 10. 17.. A.J.T.
