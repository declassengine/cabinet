468S 3 C R.i CjL -G.T.-2284     X- &quot;If At     CABIEEfr. !AIR rOLICY. . -----Memorandum submitted to the President, Air Board, &apos;by Rear-Admiral^Er&quot;F], Keir, ; C%B\,JjL,V,q,This memo, is to point out, shortly, the extraordinary danger of delay in forming the Air Ministry and commencing on a proper Air Policy,,In strategy it is necessary to put oneself in the enemy&apos;s place and to decide what he will do.    Information which confirms this is valuable.Germany will reason thus:-&quot;Armies and Navies depend for existence on supplies and communications;   destroy these and the enemy is beaten. Formerly we worked to outflank an enemy on land, in order to cut his communications;   he then had to retire or be surrounded and surrender*   This principle remains, but modern warfare renders it impossible to carry it out round the flanks of the Allied Armies;    the battle-line is too long and there is no room for a flanking army of sufficient size on the map.   Therefore we must go ovor the Allied line and stop them from coming over us*   It is thus necessary to reduce output on the Army and Navy and make a huge bombing squadron to destroy the British and French aerodromes and machines, before they come and destroy ours, and also to bomb their factories out of existence.   When we have done this, the Allies1 supplies will be reduced, and cut off, and their Armies must&quot; either&apos;retire or surrender.&quot;The submarines will continue the same work at sea, Our German policy is therefore to cut down output in everything except submarines and aircraft, and to increase our squadrons of underwater and aircraft0   We must strain every nerve to make our attack before the Allies make theirs.     If we succeed in this their attacking machines will be destroyed before they leave their own aerodromes, and -we. shall v/in the. war.   While we are building our machines wo will continue to train our pilots by sending them over the factories in England on such machines as are available at present,&quot;Information shows that the Germans have reduced their output in the following articles:-(a) Big ships,(b) Motor Transport.(c) Ammunition,and are stopping the building of Seppelins when the present ones under construction are finished.
They have sent squadrons over England presumably training pilots, as the bombs were too small for a serious raid.Photographs have been taken showing a new German bombing machine that has been produced and is actually ready for iise.   Other information says that this plane has 6 engines and can carry up to 5 tons of explosives (the Gothas carry up to 900 loo ).The Italians have information that the Germans are building 4,000 big bombing machines, though it does not fallow that all aro of tho big new type.   All of this con-firms that the Germans are carrying out their correct strategy as above.It is a race between them and us;   every day lost is a vital danger.     If the Germans get at us first, with several hundred machines every night, each one carrying several tons of explosives, Woolwich, Chatham and all the factories in London district will be laid flat, part of London wiped out, and&apos;workshops in the South-east of England will be. destroyed, and consequently our offensive on land, sea, and air will come to an end&apos;nThere is ho exaggeration in this, and if we are going to stop it, we must start at onco with cur prepara-tions to lay their factories flat, and to destroy their aerodromesd   This Will entail the building of 2,000 big bombing machines as a minimum, the training cf pilots, preparation sf aerodromes, the building of sheds, manu-facture of bombs, tho collection of transport, all of which will take about five months to complete.In short, it means the country who first strikes with its big bombing squadrons of hundreds of machines at the enemy&apos;s vital spots, will win the war0To supply all this,-the Air must have a Ministry with executive power, and also priority of output for a while, for in addition to the above requirements., they must continue to supply the Navy and the Army with suf-ficient machines and pilots to obtain the mastery over the submarines at sea, and over the enemy aircraft on the Western and other fronts.(Signed)   MARE KERR*Rear-Admiral.11th October, 1917.
