23ilo        &apos; *&quot; it is a matter to me of profound satisfaction that the Cabinet is considering an economic offensive against the Cenix&quot;-ai Fowers02n It is, believe me, in no spirit of egotism that I wouldventure to tell the Cabinet that I wrote to thte Foreign Office on the 11th December.; 19155 following, a letter on the same subject to Mr0 Asquith, to says?   15The- time may come when we ought to say to Germany that if the Germans do not make peace on cur terns we shall prevent them rehabilitating themselves after the war,,   To be in a position to say this at the right moment requires immense preparation &apos; oco OO0    We must now negotiate with as many Powers in the world as possible., presumably all our Alines and possibly even Spain,, and. who knows? the United States,, a treaty.under, which we shall be prepared at the right moment to say to Germany that we shall issue a prohibition of German goods or a probationary tariff which we have agreed to keep in effe for two years for every month Germany prolongs the war n 30 I followed this up with a Memorandum to the lateCabinet in 19160 end whilst I was at the Reconstruction Committee, travelling outside our business we made the same recpmnendation to the Government4C The arguments for such a proposal seem to me verystrong0    The Allies require geographical and political guarantees: as a result of this war, . Germany requires economic guarantees far more than either of the others   Even If the $eace which we eventually achieve is not one which will give us all that we should like, the power of such a treaty with our Allies as I had in mind in 1916 for threatening Germany would be invaluable in negotiation5, Those who study the German character have always assuredme that, as is to be expected from a scientific nation, theGerman
German people like to cut their losses. It is a magnificent thing never to know when you are beaten; it is not scientific, - it is too hot-blooded, for that, and I can conceive that those who control affairs in Germany are constantly looking to what they stand to gain and lose what chances they have of rebuilding. Ever since the Paris Conference Resolutions were published, the German people have been told in numerous newspapers and speeches that they are fighting to maintain their economic principles. If it were now made clear to them, not by a brutum fulmen but by a solemn treaty, that the longer they fought, the more certain they were to lose their economic freedom. I can imagine that they would increase so far as war possible their military activities from which I presume we have nothing to fear, and then when this failed they would sit down to realise asthe  days and weeks passed that the longer they fought the more certain would be their ruin.

6. As time has gone on the entry of new Powers into the fight on our side until practically the whole world is included, makes a treaty of this kind far more possible than it was before the continent of America, for instance, came into the war, and far more likely to be effective.

7. It is noteworthy that Protectionists and Free Traders alike in this country are willing and anxious to see this policy adopted, and I conceive it to be of the highest importance that a Conference of the Allies should be summoned at once with a view to the Conclusion of such a treaty.

8. I hope that the consideration would not merely be a consideration of refusing to buy from our enemies if they do not make a satisfactory peace, but a consideration of refusing to sell them their necessary raw materials, of breaking post-war contracts, of denying them access to our ports, of refusing them coaling facilities throughout the world.

Paris Conference.

Transition period,..I have written these notes in great haste, for I only received this morning the War Cabinet Papers in their complete form   and I understand the discussion is coming on to-morrow, but I would submit that a Conference should immediately be summoned (1) to deliberate on the methods for carrying on an economic war and (2)/to replace, the Paris Resolutions, and that whereas we should be hastening,, as I think, the time of peace by success in (1), we cannot make preparation for that peacs without success in (2), 13c A successful policy in these two matters would haveanother advantage,    I can conceive nothing more fatal to the future of our trade .and indeed to the future of our political life than to come again to the economic controversies of the period before the v/ar.    There would seem to be a large measure&apos; of agreement on an economic war during the war,, even if it entails post-war commit-.-./entst,   There would seem to be substantial agreement that those who hold   as I hold  the economic faith of Free Trade, must be prepared to sacrifice sound economic doctrine for considerations of defence to maintain the key supplies in time of danger, to control national assets, although I hope that nothing will be done to foster key industries which does not ensure the - control of prices to the consumer and the control by the State of method in the interests of progressive development,..    On the other hand, there would seem to  . Vie a modification of the view of some at any rate among those who were Tariff Reformers, a reluctance to embark - on a policy, apart from considerations of punishing the enemy, which would penalise our Allies; and it might well, be that the Corn Production Act, together with the deliberations of Mr  Long&apos;s.Committee, may settle Imperial Preference mainly on other than fiscal lines. 14,   .       For these reasons the economic war and the renewed deliberations on the topics of the Paris Conference may lead for the British Empire to the great good of a settlement   for the time at any rate, of urgent economic problems.E,,S,M.8/10,,
