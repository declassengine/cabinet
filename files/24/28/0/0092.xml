Since the beginning of the war 676,871 pensions, including children&apos;s allowances, &quot;nave been awarded.Appendix II shows that last week 38 grants of supplementary pensions and special allowances were made by the Special Grants Committee against 2C in the previous week.   The J^otal number to date is 4,578,Pensions to Soldiers. The number of fresh claims to pension of disabled soldiers dealt with by the Wards to Soldiers Branch during the week ending 10th October was 7,000 as compared with 6,200 during the previous week, and 7,000 during the week before.Of the 7,000 cases 4,097 were disposed of by tho award ?f pension, permanent or temporary, and 2,889 by the grant cf gratuities, and in 14 cases the claims wore rejected.    Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 803 cases, 791 of the men being granted gratuities and 12 pensions.    The total number of claims previously rejected which have been dealt with up to date is 10,847 cf which 1,153 have been met by the award of pension and &quot;9,694 by gratuities.

^ 0 3J U eJ2,748 cases this week include 119 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefited   by the re-assessment tr. the average extent of 4/9 a week, and 1,928 dependent parents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old Warrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate       8/3d a week.   The rest of the 2,748 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependence.As a result Q? the week&apos;s re-examination as to,, entitlement under the New Warrant 8 widows not previously helped have been admitted to full pension, and 3 to. temporary pension. 4 dependants have been admitted to pension or gratuity and 2 have been finally refused.    11 (widows and dependants) remain t(f be dealt with out of the original total cf 4,722.

gens ions Appeal Tribunal   958 Appeal forms had been received by the 10th October, an increase of 22 since the 3rd Octobor, but these numbers do not include 91 that have beon referred tc Local Committees to be dealt with in accordance with Circular 17 referred tc in paragraph 4 ctf Report XXXIV.   Appendix V shows that a considerable proportion cf tho appeals are on point3 outsido the Tribunals jurisdiction and that a larger proportion have been disposed of by award cf pension on further enquiry.During the week ended 10th October 4 casos have been determined by the Tribunal in favour of the Appellant and 3 unfavourably.    23 others have been heard or part heard. Instructions to Special Medical Boards.    In view cf the contemplated extended activities throughout the United Kingdom cf the Special medical Boards for Neurasthenia &amp;o*, the issue cf Instructions has been found necessary (Ajpondix VI).    The Special Medical Board examines cases of disablement, both of officers and cf men, due tr shell shock, neurasthenia, functional nervous disorders and epilepsy and in the case of men actually fixes the amount of pension, allowance pr gratuity t$ be awarded. The Instructions provide that the Beard is not to interpret its duties in a narrow spirit and is to take the opportunity of assisting the men in every way possible; they go largely into detail as to the methods of examination and as tc the record of the symptoms complained of, the physical conditions found and the impression left on tho mind of the examining officer;    they suggest that the examining officer should advise patients to avail themselves cf the opportunities afforded by way of Institutional treatment and otherwise; they impress on the members cf the B^ard the necessity of encouraging men cf the class with which they deal to return to some form of occupation and of discouraging the.idea of invalidism which is so detrimental to complete recovery in all cases of functional disorder; they make suggestions as to tho principles to bsadopted
k n tr3U:Jadopted in recommending tho particular form the award should take and in estimating the amount of the pension, gratuity or allowance as the case may he; and generally they aim.at uniformity of practice in dealing with the cases before them and in the assessment of awards.Retired Pay of Officers etc^i,The following is a summary of the progress made in the review of cases under the Officers Warrant of the 1st August, 1917.Officers.   Retired pay re-examined in*597 cases, of which 469 have received increased rates, the average increase being  31 a year.   About 753. remain tc be re-examined.   21 Officers &quot;slightly impaired&quot; have been placed on retired pay in lieu cf gratuities previously granted and 5 have had their gratuities increased by an Average   amount of  32,   41 gratuities in non-attributable cases have been increased the average increaso being  47.   5 gratuities of an average amount cf  36 have been awarded where no previous grant was admissible.Nurses.   49 have had their pensions increased, the average increase being  51.   4 have received increased gratuities the average increase being  33.Widows and Children. 32 Widows have had their pensions Increased from the intermediate rate tc the highest, and 3 from tho ordinary rate to intermediate, the average increase being  43.   51 Children&apos;s allowances have been Increased the average increase being  5.2 Widows who had previously been granted gratuities where no pension was previously admissible have been  ranted pension at the intermediate rate.Other relatives. The rules submitted tc the Treasury have now been generally approved by them, and it is hoped that progress with those cases will soon be made,(11) Under the Order in Council of 29th September 1917, 17 Naval Officers cases have been re-examined,in 14 cases increasedDisability
Disability Pensions have resulted, the average Increase being  26.   About 223 remain to be examined,TREATMENT.Amendments to Instructions. Representations have been made to -the Minister that small amendments to the Instructions for dealing with the treatment of disabled men aro required to enable more prompt action to be taken In certain types of case. An amended Instruction is therefore being issued of which a copy is given in Appendix VII.   Of the corrections thore madethe most important are -(a) an addition to Instruction 34 which will enable a Local Committee to pay out of a man1.? personal allowance the sum required to purchase extra clothing or other requisites he may need during his treatment in an institution.(b) an amendment of the procedure for dealing with theallowances of men who require repair or adjustment cf their&quot; iiartificial limbs and who for this purpose have to go tcRoehampton or one of the other limb-fitting hospitals.It has been found that owing to the demand on thoaccommodation of Roehampton and other hospitals that the menhave at times to wait a week or two before being able to obtainadmission.   In such cases where the men aro unable to work pendingif-their admission the Local Committee are already enabled to pay the allowance under Instruction 30, and in future it will be arranged that tho Local Committee will in all cases bo empowered to make the allowance both during this preliminary period and during the manfs stay in the limb-fitting hospital in place of the arrangement ay which the allowance is paid centrally during tho latter period.
Medical Referees^ The -Committee for the selection of Medical Referees to be appointed by the Minister met again on the 10th instant and agreed on their recommendations with regard to Berkshire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, Buckinghamshire   and Oxfordshire. Schemes of treatment. Several schemes of treatment involving arrangements with auxiliary and civil hospitals have been submitted and sanctioned during the week.   A report cf those schemes is given in Appendix VIII.    The very comprehensive schemes put forward by the Worcestershire, and Denbighshire Local Committees may be noticed.    It is satisfactory tc note that local civil hospitals are now generally falling into line in accepting the rates cf payment laid down in Schedule I to the Instructions of the Ministry.   Tke representation made in certain quarters that remuneration should be provided for the medical men attending the hospitals has been met in seme instances by the Committee of management of the hospital agreeing to set aside a percentage of the payments made by Local Committees for the benefit of the medical staff.&apos; Individual Cases cf Treatment.    The great bulk of cases Qf treatment are dealt with under general schemes which havo received approval, but a small number of cases requiring special treatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has not previously been given arc submitted each week. During the week ended the 10th instant 109 such cases were so sanctioned.3.Numbers under. Treatment. Appendix IX shows the total number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made or approved by the ministry and to. whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are payable.    It will be scon that 272 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended 10th September and that 1,522 men were under treatment on that date, as compared with 1,271 men at tho end of the previous week.
The Table shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required, and it will be seen that about half the cases are of wounds or injuries, and raibher less than 1C per cent cases of paraplegia.   83 cases of neurasthenia were under treatment at Golders Green      the 10th instant and 26 of advanced tuberculosis in the hospitals of the metropolitan Asylums Board in London.The number of discharged men in Lunatic asylums v/ho have been admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was, on the 10th instant, 548.   Of these 45 had been admitted during the week.14.   Discharged Soldiers in public Asylums,   Attached as Appendix X is a brief memorandum on the treatment of soldiers who have boen discharged from the Army on account of insanity and are being cared for in County or Borough Asylums.   This memorandum has been prepared to explain to the public who have been inveighing againct giving our men who have lost their reason the pauper taint, that these men are treated as private patients until their status has been determined and that all are then dealt with as service patients, except those who having been inmates of an Asylum before enlistment, have to return there without their insanity having been in any way caused or aggravated by military service.TRAliJIHG.15. Disabled men rc-quiring light work.   Representations have been made to tho I inister from many quarters that there are a certain number of discharged disabled men whose disablement prevents them either temporarily or permanently from undertaking anything but light work.   Local Committees have found considerable difficulty in meeting the needs of such cases.    It has been thought advisable therefore to communicate with theRepresentatives
  f\ A*i u uRepresentatives of the Ministry with a view to Scheduling exactly the kinds of light work available and if possible, to secure that for work cf this kind the employers in a district should undertake to give a preference to disabled men.   As an instance of the light work that could be done cf this nature a large Lining Company in the North has furnished the ministry with a list of the lighter jobs which could bo performed by disabled men at the pit-head.   A copy of the letter which has been cent to the Rcspresentatives of the Ministry on this point is given in Appendix XI. 16.   Spejc^ial^Tr&amp;dos. Reports on the openings for disabled men in the Leather Goods Trade and in the Handsewn Boot and Shoe Making and repairing trade have been prepared by the Ministry of Labour.   Copies are given in Appendix XII.Appendix XIII contains a report of meetings held during the week ended the 10th instant by the Trade Advisory Committees representing the Printing and kindred trades, the Engineering and Shipbuilding trade, the Carpentry and Joinery trade, the Boot and Shoe trade, and tho Furniture and Leather Goods trade.   Tho opposition shown by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners for the training of disabled men in carpentry is unfortunate but there is reason to believe that a settlement can bo arrived at. ^* Schemes of training. Appendix XIV contains a report cf the schemes of training submitted to and sanctioneilbythe Ministry during&apos;the week ended the 10th instant.   The schemes sanctioned for the Manchester and London Local Committee may be notieod. 18. Individual cases of Training. Owing to the comparative ease       j with which employment is obtained now, the number cf men1offering themselves for training is, in the area of any single Local Committee, usually limited and are frequently not enough to call for general schemes of training.    In consequence alargo proportion of the men who are admitted to training are theIsubject
^subject of individual application and sanction by the ministry.   During the week ended the 10th instant 49 cases of training were e,hus sanctioned.    Of. these eight wore to receive commercial training, eight were to be trained in the trades connected with engineering, 5 in motor mechanics and 5 as Electricity Sub-station attendants.o. number of Hen under,gaining Appendix XV shows that 113 men were admitted to training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week was 474.   Rather less than three quarters of the number were under training in Technical Institutes.0. Training of Interned men. Appendix XVI is a report by Major Mitchell on training courses for prisoners of war in Switzerland,    It shows that the work is being done on a useful scale and in a satisfactory manner.   Under the auspices of the Red Cross Society, Lord Sandwich has now gone to Holland tc organize training for the interned men there.ORGANIZATION.Permanent Committee of the Intor-Alllsd Conference   In paragraph 12 of the report for the period from 12th to 18th May last there was a note on the opening meeting cf the Inter-Allied Conference on the after-care of disabled soldiers, and in paragraph 15 of the Report for tho period from 14th tc 20th July reference was made to the meeting held in Paris on the 11th July of the Permanent Committee of &quot;tho conference. The second meeting of this Committee is now being held in London.   The delegates arrived in England on the 8th instant and wore met by Lt. Col. Stantcn and brought t$ London, accommodation on boat and train being reserved.   The following day they were introduced to tlie Pensions Minister, and held their first meeting.   Appendix XVII contains the daily programme of the Committee, a list of the delegates and the agenda paper.   A report of their action will be included in a subsequent report.
^IE^g^ilr-aP--ts Ccmml11 8&apos;   A mestinS of the sPccial ^ants Committee was held on the 2nd October.   The minutes of this meeting are annexed as Appendix XVIII.    The Committoe agreed tc submit to the Ministry various amendments to the Regulations Part II most of which had been previously recommended by the Statutory Committee.   These amendments deal with supplementary separation allowances to children, emergency grants to widows and children and in maternity cases, un   extension of the period of granting special separation allowances from 13 to 26 weeks and the enlargements the definition cf rent, whilst a general regulation was agreed to empowering tho Committee by resolution tc grant a supplementary allowance In any case which was not covered by the regulations in force.   Tho Committee further suggested that certain cases coming under the present regulations should be dealt with by the Health Section cf the Ministry.The various submissions and suggestions of the Committee aro now under consideration of the Ministry. Reports of Inspectors. Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for tho week ending 10th October are contained in Appendix MIX.At Batloy in the &quot;Jest Riding the administration Is satisfactory.    Thanks largely to the devotion of its Honorary-Secretary, the work of the Nottingham ttcrough Local Committee is the subject of an eulogistic report.   At Lutcn the work is well organized.   Wiltshire Local Committee is out of touch with its aub-committees many of which were visited by the Inspector, whoso reports upon Devizes and Trowbridge are unsatisfactory.   In some of the sub-committees the question of a War Badge for Committee officials was raised.    Swindon is reported as doing fairly well.Of Stirlingshire and its district Committees there is little to report.
The expenditure of the Antrim Local Committee up tc June 30th amounted to  100 whilst the administrativd expenses up to the same date came to  144; on the other hand Armagh?s administrative expenses were very low; the expenditure of the &apos;&quot;:igan Committee averaged for the last throe quarters  37 whilst the administrative expenses were practically nil.Staff etc.Numbers of Staff.   Appendix XX shows an addition of 122 to the staff of the Ministry during the week.    There has been an addition tq almost very branch, the largest increases being 57 to the Pension Issue Office, 47 to the Awards to Soldiers Branch and 12 to the Awards to V/idows 6cc, Branch.    The staff on the books of the Ministry new comprises 278 men and 4,382 women, or 4660 in all.The daily percentage of absences during the week was 3.9 among the male and 6 among the female staff. The questions cf additional accommodation for the staff at Chelsea has been settled by a decision of the Cabinet Committee on Accommodation that temporary offices for another 800 clerks should be   erected at the Duke of Ycrk&apos;s Headquarters.    It is essential that a block for 400 should be completed by the end of the year.October 13th, 1917. :  -

APPENDIX VInfidential. For Members of the Special Medical Board only.ATUITIES, TEMPORARY ALLOWANCES TO MEN SUFFER-ING FROM NEURASTHENIA AND FUNCTIONAL NERVE DISEASE.1. The Special Medical Board was constituted with the object of aiding Gratuities and recommending Pensions, both to soldiers on charge from the Army and those in receipt of Pensions from elsea, who were suffering from Shell Shock, Neurasthenia, notional. Nervous Disorders, and Epilepsy, but it has been found essary to extend considerably its functions since the issue of the val Warrant of March 29th, 1917.]. At first the activities of the Board were limited to urasthenic cases in London and its vicinity, but arrangements ve now been made by which the work is extended to England, Scot-ad, Wales and Ireland, by means of Local Boards which are com-sed either of two Members of the Special Medical Board or of Civil aetitioners presided over by a Member of the Central Special rdical Board. In addition to the Central Board, which meets daily London, special Branch Boards have been established in Edinburgh rthe Scottish Command, and in Belfast and Dublin for the Irish norland, and Centres formed in England and Wales at Berrington, nningham, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff. Chat-in. Leicester, Manchester, Newcastle, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Maghull Military Hospital (Liverpool).THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BOARD&apos;S FUNCTIONS.1. The Board is not to interpret its duties in a narrow spirit; it expected to take full opportunities of assisting the men in every v possible. The examinations afford exceptional opportunities of toiingto usefulness men suffering from disabling mental attitudes, steps are to be taken to help those functional cases which are com-:,ited by the presence of organic disease.Tubercular cases are referred to the Tuberculosis Officer.lien suffering from Venereal Disease are recommended to reportmselves at the medical clinics, under the control of the localilieal Officers of Health, lately established by the Local Governmentsrd for the treatment of these affections. %-,.&apos;t..1 large proportion of cases should be referred to the Local Warasions Committee of the District with a view to work being foundthem, or for supervision of their home circumstances.   In Londonsb cases are referred to a Special Officer.   Appropriate cases arebe referred to the Hospitals, and, as occasion arises, the familytor should be communicated with;VINSTRUCTIONS.(13253.)

4. Three classes of cases are seen by the Board:  (i) Hospital Cases. Soldiers who are still in the Army, but are recommended for discharge, and who come before Special Medical Board for approval of the reeomwenda of discharge, and for the award of a Gratuity, a &apos; porary Allowance, or the recommendation of a Pensio(ii) Pensioners.   Men already discharged from the Army whoin receipt of a Pension, and who come before the B from time to time in order that they may be re-exam&apos; with a view to the award of a Gratuity or reconsidera of the ampunt of Pension to be awarded.(iii) Men who have been recommended by War Pension Qmittees for admission to a Home of Recovery.CASES NOT SUITABLE FOR THE SPECIAL MEDICAL BOA5. In the event of any case being presented for examination or examination which is found not to come within the scope of the c of cases dealt with by the Special Medical Board, the Board i examine the case, assess the disabilitj-, and a note should be mad the man&apos;s papers that in the event of further examination h necessary it should not again be sent to the Special Medical B for review7.If an unsuitable case is sent for examination and Approval of charge from a Hospital, it should not be dealt with by the BoarTHE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF CASES.(3. A formal medical examination is always  an  ordeal  to suffering from Functional Nerve Disease.   Experience shows tin is unwise to place too much reliance upon a nervous manner, co tremor or marked stammering alone, for these are often induced unconsciously exaggerated at the time of the examination.The prognosis of Functional Nerve Disease is always difficult, the difficulty is much enhanced when it depends upon accura gauging the value of alleged subjective symptoms. What a pat alleges he feels is always verv real to him, but unhesitating!, accept statements and indiscriminately to award Gratuities, porary Allowances or Pensions at these examinations in the abs of physical corroboration would in many cases be to do harm to individual and injustice to the State.As a rule few malingerers will be found they have been weeded by the Medical Officer of the Unit, the Travelling Medical Boan at the Hospital where they have been under treatment. C exaggeration, both conscious and unconscious, is, however, often with, and much patience, combined with a thorough fxaminn is required in most cases to arrive at an equitable judgment.RECORDS OF EXAMINATION.7. The. salient facts in the history of the case should be recoi such as date and place of injuries, operations, or serious illnesse
A permanent record -of all symptoms complained of, of the physicalIonditions found, and (a note) of the impression left on the mind of j,e examiner as to the man&apos;s mental attitude to work is kept on a Wd $ndex System; the cards being carefully filed for future refer-nce. /The object aimed at in this record is, that it should be suffi-ieiitly ample for the examiner subsequently to visualise the case, so jat should an Appeal be made or enquiries be instituted the whole ircumstances may be recalled.S. The Presidents of the Scotch and Irish Branches will send at the lid of each month copies of the Index Cards of all cases which have ocn examined by the Branch Boards.In this way a complete record of all cases discharged from the Army Neurasthenia and Functional Nerve Disease will be available for eference at the Head Quarters of the Board.   All cards are to hear jio signatures of Members who examined the case.X-RAYS.0. Arrangements have been made for X-ray and Electrical Reaction [Examinations to be made at King George Hospital, Stamford Street, i.E.   The documents of the case should be retained until the report Is received.OPHTHALMIC CASES.10. Major Kerr (a Member of the Board) will  report  on  all1Ophthalmic cases in London. When this cannot be arranged the man should be sent to Millbank Hospital. In the Provinces arrangements jro made with local Ophthalmic Surgeons.AURAL CASES.11. Major Dundas Grant, of 18, Cavendish Square, W., has, withIihe consent of the D.D.M.S., London District, been added to the Staff of the Board as Honorary Consulting Aural Surgeon. In cases where his advice is required, application should in the first Instance be made to the President.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WORK.Institutional Treatment and Training.mm 12. Members of the Board are requested to put all recommendations jOfflcr work, institutional treatment and training, &amp;c, on the cards after I Wjheir other remarks, and in order to prevent any possibility- of the j^rw-ommendations being overlooked in every ease&apos;to&apos; bracket the re-mmendation thvs [        ]*me ioiiDISORDERLY ACTION OF THE HEART.13. Men in receipt of a Pension who are suffering from Tachycardia or other nervous affections of the heart, and who allege incapacity for nork, should be recommended for a Home of Recovery, or for Hamp-stoad Hospital for Heart Cases.
In the event of refusal of appropriate treatment the fact shouldnoted on the card and on Form A.        and the statement unclined. If it is considered that the case should be dealt Yrj&amp;h. uj Section 4 R.W. a further note to that effect should be made.REMEDIAL EXERCISE ROOM.14. A considerable number of cases suffer from Functional tractures, Inco-ordination of gait, and various forms of Talipes, other disabilities which are of a distinctly remedial character. Y, the nature of these conditions is fully explained and energetic d remedial exercises are arranged for, a large proportion are within a few weeks.A Remedial. Exercise Room has been instituted at 78, Lancai Gate, to provide short courses of Massage and Re-education, wit view to determining the man&apos;s mental attitude towards recovery, for the removal of temporary disabilities.A Member of the Board is responsible for the general supervision this Department. In no case is treatment stopped without consu tion with the Members of the Board who recommended treatmenThe Ministry of Pensions pays the man&apos;s travelling expenses any loss of wages incurred whilst attending for treatment.   M cases which without treatment would have resulted in a perniam disability have sufficiently recovered to justify the award of Gratituity or Temporary Allowance.It is suggested that this procedure might with advantage adopted in Provincial centres.VENEREAL DISEASE.15. Both recent and old-standing cases of Venereal Disease are all instances to be recommended to attend for treatment at Veneri Centres. Under no circumstances is any reference to the prese: of this disease to be communicated by letter or otherwise to M Pensions Committees or any other body or person, except to a medi man when arranging for treatment. A printed list of Centres London and in Provincial towns is provided. The address, day a hour of attendance at the nearest clinic to the man&apos;s residencel to be written on a piece of paper and handed to him.Advice should be given of the danger of neglect.   He should informed that attendance at a Centre will not in any way afTJ his right to a Pension, and he should be urged to avail himself the full of the modern method of treatment thus afforded.HOMES OF RECOVERY.16. All cases of pronounced Neurasthenia or Functional Ne Disease which have not hitherto responded to treatment or wli progress has been slow, should be invited to avail themselves of opportunity of treatment in Instiutions of the ctass of the F
I, of Recovery. The advantages offered should be fully explained ,e man, and his willingness or otherwise to avail himself of pecial treatment should be ascertained. A copy of &apos;the illus-paVphlet, which describes the advantages of these Homes of very,&apos; should be given to the man. It may be necessary to time for consideration. Instructions should be given, however, that they must intimate their willingness or otherwise to avail ;elves of this method of cure before leaving the Board Room, should be explained, however, that h7s admission may be delayed, jere is much pressure on the accommodation of the existing unions.a rule, men earning good wages, although ill, are not suitable, ne who does not desire to be well can be accepted, -bough there are at present only two Institutions available  Home of Recovery at Golders Green, London, and a similar tution at Craig Avon, Belfast other Institutions are being n\ at Centres where a sufficient number of cases demand it.Ministry of Pensions is anxious to start similar Homes in tent parts of the country, and a careful note of all such cases be made in order that information may be gained as to where Institutions should be started. It is essential, therefore, that a n of all suitable cases willing to enter a Home should be made; should be noted on the cards, and bracketed thus [ ].   Seepara. 47.Xo case should be recommended for a Home of Recovery if the is in regular employment or when the Temporary Allowance is all one. These Institutions are only for serious cases, and for who are incapable of earning a livelihood.When men who are seen on behalf of the War Pensions Com-es are found, upon examination, to be suffering from disabilities i are neither due to, nor aggravated by, military service, they (1 not be recommended for Homes of Recovery, and the fact on the yellow card.n discharged under Section 7 (ii) of the Royal Warrant are, rule, not suitable for admission to Homes of Recovery. The Institutional Committee provides Colonies for Epileptics, n the case of men who are likely to enter such a Colony (where il terms such as those at Golders Green would be provided) the i&quot; Epileptic Colony &quot; should be noted on the card and under-LOCAL WAR PENSIONS COMMITTEES.The Special Medical Board is impressed with the necessity in ass of case with which it deals of encouraging men to return aie form of occupation when able, and of discouraging the idea. validism, which is so detrimental to complete recovery in all of functional disorder.has been the practice of some War Pensions Committees to ement Gratuities, Temporary Allowances and Pensions awarded 1 Special Medical Board, even when the latter have been reducedIie Board with the express object of bringing about a man&apos;s n to work.
The  Ministry  has circularised  all  War  Pensions   Committees pointing put that the awards and recommendations of the Special Medical Board&apos; are made with a view to assisting the men to^returia to work, and that additional assistance in these cases nullifies the] work of the Special Medical Board.The Committees are requested to assist by scrutinising very care-l fully cases dealt with by the Special Medical Board in which appeals! are made for convalescent tickets, supplemental grants, &amp;c. andj especially those cases where the Pension has been reduced with the object of encouraging a return to work where the work-habit has) been broken.When difficulty arises in cases dealt with by the Special Medical] Board, they should be reported at once to the President of the Special) Medical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.The names of /all men in each district who have been awarded&apos; Gratuities, andgthose whose pensions have been reduced with a view to inducing a return to work, are forwarded daily to the Local War Pension Committees.Awards, Assessments, principles of, allowances, for Institutional Training.18. Under this AVarrant awards to invalided soldiers are made under the following headings:  Gratuities, Temporary Allowances, Pensions.Men examined by the Special Medical Board -are dealt with In-each of these methods.As the new Warrant gives enhanced opportunities of granting temporary allowances, the number of Gratuities has correspondingly diminished. In all cases the estimated duration of the disabilitv determines the amount awarded. -The difference between a Gratuity and a Temporary Allowance is. that whereas in the former the amount awarded is paid in one sura, in the latter the amount is paid in weekly instalments over a fixed period.Where it is inadvisable to award a Gratuity or Temporary Allow-ance, a Conditional Pension, which is reviewed at periods varying from four to twelve months, is recommended.Service and Disability Pensions.19. Men invalided from the Army with less than 14 years&apos; service are not entitled to any Pension other than that awarded for their disability.Men invalided with 14, but less than 18, years&apos; service receive.a disability pension and nothing more, hut when they have recovered from the disability for which they were invalided they may be granted a permanent pension on account of having over 14 years&apos; service.   Such pension, as a rule, is not less than 8r/. a da3r.Men with over 18 years&apos; pensionable service are entitled to a service pension irrespective of disability. For instance, a man with 18 years&apos; pensionable service invalided for a disability caused or
Iravated by service with one-half incapacity, would be entitled disability pension of 13s. 9d. a week. This disability pension ild ty?ntinue according to the degree of disablement, as long as nas disabled, and in addition the man would receive the pension Bed by service and this would be continued after the disability ;ion ceased.RANK.[ij. It is necessary, in view of the new Royal Warrant, 29th March, , to ascertain a man&apos;s rank, either substantive or acting, at the1,e he was wounded, injured, or removed from duty in consequence disablement, lie reason for this is, that the new Royal Warrant says:  &apos;&apos; The pension granted to a soldier who held paid acting rank at the time he was wounded, injured, or removed from duty in consequence of disablement may be at the rate appropriate to that rank.&quot;The following list of the various Ranks of N.C.Os. is published r the convenience of Officers, who should bear in mind the neces-:f for obtaining from each man a true statement as to his rank the time of being wounded :  [arrant Officers, Class I.

THE CLASS OF CASE SUITABLE FOR GRATUITIES ALLOWANCES AND PENSIONS.21. It is always a difficult question to decice whether it-jfe best to award a Gratuity or Temporary Allowance, or recommend a Pension. No general rule can be laid down, as each case must be judged strictly on its merits. It is obvious, however, that where a man&apos;s incapacity is likely to make him unfit for work of any kind for a period of four months or over, the prognosis is so uncertain that a Conditional Pension should be awarded.Experience has taught the Special Medical Board that it is inadvisable to hand over to men unaccustomed to dealing with little more than a weekly wage what is to them a large sum of money. The recommendation, therefore, save in exceptional circumstances, is made to pay a Gratuity in the form of a Temporary Allowance, e.g., the immediate payment of, say,  5, and the remainder in equal weekly payments of 20s. or 30s., according to the size of the niairs family. This plan enables Gratuities in the form of Temporarv Allowances to be given to a larger number of men than &quot;would otherwise be possible. The difference between a Temporary Allow-ance and a Pension is that the former carries with it the impression of finality while a Pension suggests a permanency or at least a renewal.As a rule, very young men are incapable of using advantageously a gratuity. Men who have been in the Army for many years prior to the war. who have learned no trade and have no experience of dealing with anything but very small sums, should not be trusted with a lump sum.In forming an opinion as to the advisability of granting a gratuity, much must depend upon the impression which the ex-soldier makes upon the mind of the examiner. There are. for instance, many cases where homes have- been broken up or where a small business is about to be started, or where a man purposes to leave the country, in which the immediate payment of a gratuity is invaluable.There are other cases where the man&apos;s history and manner give the impression that he is not likely to make good use of anything hut a Temporary Allowance or a Pension.ASSESSMENT OF GRATUITIES AND TEMPORARY ALLOWANCES.22. Gratuities and Temporary Allowances are awarded by care-fully estimating the period during which the ex-soldier is likelv to remain wholly and subsequently partially unfit for industrial work, and this can only be done by examination of the medical history sheet and a thorough physical examination of the case. To the sum thus calculated an additional amount, not exceeding 50 per cent., may be added in order to prevent the possibility of any injustice being done.23. It is found, as a rule, impracticable to assess the duration of disablement where it is obvious no kind of work can be resumed under four months. In these and similar cases no Gratuity or Temporary Allowance is awarded, but a Conditional Pension is
anted. After a definite interval the man is re-examined, and if, is frequently found, recovery is undoubtedly taking place, a BipojlLary Allowance or a Conditional Pension is awarded. 24. When it has been decided to award a Gratuity or Temporary lowance, the amount must be definitely fixed before informing i man of the Board&apos;s decision.After this has been done the man may be informed of the amount, (] then any information he can give that will be helpful in forming opinion as to the most advantageous method of payment is to taken into consideration.It should be pointed out to the man that the amount of the -itiiity or Temporary Allowance awarded depends not only upon f degree of his disability but upon his rank and number of depen-nt children. This is important, for men often compare with eir friends the various amounts awarded, and are sometimes at a 5 to understand what appear to be differences in the sums which re been arrived at.The amount of the Gratuity is to be written in words and figures 13. 179 andMarried men should be asked how many children they have under itcen years of age. Illegitimate and adopted children may be eluded, if supported.(o) When the Special Medical Board decides after examina-m that the disability for which a pensioner was discharged has ised, and a recommendation is made that his present pension onld be final, the man should be informed of the Board&apos;s decision that effect.If, however, his pension (or the gratuity assessed on a period of siiblement) has not run for more than a year, a final payment of imay be made to him.(iv) In cases of obvious mental enfeeblement, or severe epilepsy, where it is considered advisable that the man&apos;s condition and future ospects should be discussed with relatives, it may be advisable to range for this.The man should be asked to give name and address of a relative 10 would supply information, and arrangements made to have the &apos;ative interviewed at a subsequent date.25.

Epileptics.h estimating the disability of an epileptic, the following factors just be taken into account:  first. The actual loss of working capacity as a result of the fits. his depends on the frequency, intensity, and the usual time of in-idence of the fits. The loss of one day&apos;s work for each seizure is ufficiently near the mark.Second. The handicap in the labour market as a result of prejudice mainst Epileptics o&apos;n the part of employers and fellow-icorkmen. In normal labour market this factor is an important one, and the ccurrence of a fit even once a month would detract quite 20 per cent, rom a man&apos;s capacity.Taking these points into consideration, it seems probable that the [capacity in even a mild case of Epilepsy should be rated at not less Jan 5 to 20 per cent. Hence the necessity of very careful enquiry ;hen deciding whether Epilepsy in a discharged soldier is the result i. or aggravated by, Military Service. A number of cases diagnosed ;&quot;&apos; fits &quot; (even including those certified as true Epilepsy), are purely vsterical attacks, the majority of which cease entirely. Epilepsy ,liich arises as the result of military service, and which negatives the fsinnption of the man&apos;s previous occupation, necessitates the assump-ion of a considerably higher percentage of incapacity.SPECIAL MEDICAL BOARD.Table III.

In cases where Gratuities or Temporary Allowances are granted to men whose pre-war earnings were in excess of the maximum pension which the Board is entitled to award the cases should be referred to the Ministry for increased assessment in the light of the mairs pre-war earnings.32. Under the Royal Warrant the disability must be estimated as a percentage^ and pensions recommended only in the following per-centages:  20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100.It will-be noted that no pension can he recommended on a basis of less than 20 per cent., and that when the disability is over 80 per cent, it must be reckoned for pension purposes as 100 per cent.CAUSATION AND AGGRAVATION BY MILITARY SERVICEA.F. B. 179.33. Documents are sometimes returned by the Ministry of Pensions with a request for a statement as to wdiether certain cases are due to. or aggravated by, Military Service.    This is generally due to no I notice having been taken of the fact that question 20 (a), 1, 2, and 3, on A.P. B. 179 had originally been answered in the negative.It is obvious that no alteration can be made on A.F. B. 179, which i bears the Invaliding Officers signature, but if the Board, after examination of the case, is unable to agree with the opinion expressed by the Invaliding Board on A.F. B. 179, the opinion of the Special Medical Board must be written as an addition to the recommendationl printed by the Board&apos;s rubber stamp.ALLOWANCES DURING INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT.34. No allowances can be given to men entering a Home of Re-covery, if they are not eligible for a Pension or Gratuity by reason of their disability being due to or aggravated by Service.35. Neither Gratuities nor Temporary Allowances should be reconi-mended for men suitable for Institutional treatment; such cases should have Conditional Pensions. These will be suspended whilst the man is in the Home, and he will be again Boarded immediately after he leaves the Home.36. Men who have been awarded Gratuities by the Special Medical Board for disabilities due to service, and xchose condition has relapsed. may, if certified by the Special Medical Board, be admitted into In-stitutions and will be granted the usual allowances.37. Men who have been examined by an Invaliding Board or Travelling Medical Board and have not been awarded &amp; Pension] Temporary Allowance or Gratuity, and who are subsequently four... to be suffering from Neurasthenia, may be admitted to Homes o; Recovery and granted the usual allow-ances, provided the Specia Medical Board certifies that their condition is either attributable to o: aggravated by War Service, and that Institutional Treatment i necessary.38. Men whose disability is neither due to nor aggravated by Mili tary Service, Sect. 7 (ii) Royal Warrant, if found suitable, ar*
lititled to Institutional treatment, but are not entitled to allowances themselves or their families.  They are to be accepted for treat-lent only on the understanding that the treatment is free, and that , allowances will be made.139. All men except where their disability is neither due to nor rgravated by Service on entering a Hospital, Convalescent Home, ^rlome of Recovery, have, in liexi of pension or gratuity in the form temporary allowance, an allowance from the Ministry of Pensions ,lieu of Pension, according to the following scale:  Single Men. Married Men.ft, Gd. per week and an allowance    27s. Gd. per week, (for Dependents. 13s. 9cZ. per week for wife.5s. for 1st child per week. 4s. 2d. for 2nd child per week. 3s. id. for 3rd child 2s. 6i7. for each other child per week.ibject to a deduction of Is. per diem for maintenance. The allowance will be higher in cases of men above the rank or lative rank of Private.41). Many men who definitely promise to undergo Institutional reatment subsequently decline to do so. If a full pension is awarded i the time of the examination under the assumption that a man will liter an Institution, and he subsequently fails to do so, he will jauniarily benefit by refusal.The correct procedure is to recommend a Conditional Pension, jessed on the basis of the man&apos;s incapacity, irrespective of his con-[;nt to submit to Institutional Treatment. His case should be recoin-jeuded for re-examination in four months. The man should be ade clearly to understand the course pursued. If on further examination it is found that he has been offered and nreasonably declined Institutional Treatment, his case should be -alt with under para. 4 of the Royal Warrant. Occasionally this iirse should be adopted at the first examination if all offers of reme-al treatment are unreasonably declined. A report should be made the Ministry as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the refusal; .1 the man should be informed a report will be made on his case and Mtl the penalty involved.calINDUCTION OF PENSION WITH A VIEW TO INDUCING A ^ RETURN TO WORK.p^j 11. Where the award of a Gratuity or Temporary7 Allowance is in-klrisable, and a reduced pension is recommended with a view to Ir-xlucing a return to work, the reason for the recommendation should &apos;i-v&apos; A 36W-i noted on A.F. B. 179 or &apos; and on the Index Card, and g^ielosed thus [        ].
GRATUITIES OR TEMPORARY ALLOWANCES OF  30 ANDUPWARDS. y42. When a Gratuity of  30 (Thirty Pounds) and upwards is awarded to a man who was an Insured Person under the National Health Insurance Act while in the Army., if there is any period or total disablement in the assessment, the following procedure will be necessary:  (i) To add the sum of  6. 10s. (Six Pounds Ten Shillings) to the Gratuity.(ii) To inform the man that the Gratuity awarded includes Sick-ness Benefit from the National Health Insurance for 26 weeks, and that he will not be entitled to any further sick-ness or disablement benefit from the National Health In-surance until he has completed 26 weeks of substantialh-regular employment after his discharge from the Army. *EARLY DISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL.43. The Discharge of all soldiers is dated 21 days from the date on which the President of the Special Medical Board, who is the Ap-proving Medical Officer, signs the man&apos;s discharge papers, but in cases seen by the Special Medical Board authority is given under Section 7 of A.C.I. 725 of 1917 to arrange for the immediate discharge of the men from Hospital, if thought desirable.Cases of Neurasthenia and Functional Nerve Disease, which have been seen by the Board, and have been awarded a Gratuity, a Tein-porary Allowance or a Pension, need not be detained in Hospital more than a few days, provided arrangements can be made for their dis-charge. The following notices are sent in all cases to the Hospitals concerned:  With reference to para. 7 of A.C.I. 725 of 1917, I authorise tli immediate discharge from Hospital of any soldier whose discharg from the Service has been approved by the Special Medical Board at any date subsequent to the date of the Receipt of A.F W 3484c.(Signed)   John Collie, Col. A.M.S..President.le srePROCEDURE WITH REGARD TO APPEALS.44. Appeals againsE the Board&apos;s decisions and those against other Boards have from time to time to be considered.When dealing with so difficult a problem as the prognosis of Functional Nerve Disease, complicated as it often is by the misplaced sympathy of relatives, it is not surprising that decisions have to be reviewed.When an Appeal has been made by a pensioner against the finding of the Special Medical Board, the case is in every instance to be seen by two Members Of the Board who have not previously examined the case. If, after re-examination, a substantial increase in the amount awarded in thefirst instance is recommended, this is the finding of the Board.   The Appeal examination is to be made without any reference
those who in the first instance reported upon the man. The finding . to he laid before the President of the Board for his approval and:.gnatitre.Should, however, the Members who examine the case as the result of ae Appeal feel that they are not prepared to make a substantial grease upon the first recommendation, the President of the Boardto be consulted.Appeals should be dealt with by one of the following methods:   In the case of a Gratuity the appellant should be informed that the sum (if not accepted) will be paid out in definite fixed instal-ments by the Central Army.Pension Issue Office as a Temporary Allowance to cover the period during which the disability is estimated to last, and that if necessary he will be re-examined after the last payment has been made.Unless substantial reason is advanced for an Appeal, it is often unnecessary to re-examine the appellant, and the case is dealt with by informing the appellant that the Gratuity was not arrived at in a haphazard method, but by a careful calculation of the number of months in which there was likely to be total and subse-(pient partial incapacity, and that a definite sum had been arrived at uoon this basis.APPEALS AGAINST THE DECISIONS OF INVALIDINGBOARDS.15In cases of Appeal against the decisions of Invaliding Boards iich are referred to the Special Medical Board by the Ministry of -nsions, the medical reasons for the decisions arrived at should in cases be set out in detail.EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF WAR PENSION COMMITTEES.5.

Members of the Board will attend at Chelsea as directed for th purpose of selecting from the documents there all cases suitable fn examination by the Special Medical Board. The following instruc tions must be adhered to in selecting cases : -(1) All cases labelled Neurasthenia, Hysteria, Shell Shock, Nervou Debility, Functional Paralysis, and Epilepsy are to be selected.(2) Cases marked D.A.H. are to be chosen unless they turn out orevision on the -7J- form to be organic. o.(3) When only A.F.

A man discharged on the grounds of certifiable insanity should be regarded as pensionable unless definite evidence is forth-coming that he was the subject of insanity (which includes idiocv and advanced imbecility) at the time of enlistment, or unless he is ex-cluded by any of the conditions contained in the &quot; Directions &quot; attached hereto.Rule 2. A man discharged on the grounds of certifiable insanity should, pruna facie, be regarded as pensionable although, prior to enlistment, he may- have had one attack of certified insanity. When, however, a man has had more than one attack of certified insanity, prior to enlistment, there must (to render him pensionable) be evidence that the recrudescence of the disability has been caused or aggravated by war service.Rule 3. For the purpose of Article 9 of the Royal Warrant a man should not be regarded as pensionable if, during the period which has elapsed since he was discharged, he has been able to follow an ordinary civilian life, and no connection can reasonably be traced between the attack of insanity and the man&apos;s previous naval or military service.DIRECTIONS FOR APPLYING THE FOREGOING &quot; FORMULA.&quot;A differential diagnosis between the numerous forms of mental dis-order, officially recognised for statistical purposes, is by no means an easy matter even in the hands of experts, and, in deciding whether
Lan&apos;s insanity has been caused or aggravated by service, such a. joiioijis, except in.the cases mentioned below, need not concern those jponsfble for the decision :  ill ;: Congenital mental deficiency &quot; appearing on a medical reportin insufficient term to enable the case to be adequately considered,it may include feeble-minded cases of high-grade.Hio-h-grade   feeble-mindedness   (Le.,   feeble-mmdedness   of   onlyderate  degree),  though recognised medically as a predisposinguse of insanity, should be ignored in assessing a case for pensionrposes.(2) Insanity associated with epilepsy:  When a man suffers from an attack of insanity subsequent to enlist-.,,t. the mere fact that the insanity is of a character which is prob-lv produced by Epilepsy, the Epilepsy having existed before enlist-.[it. does not disentitle him to a pension.(3) In cases of insanity associated with syphilis, including general rnlvsis of the insane, hon-pensionability should be confined to those n who had shown definite evidence of cerebral disease before enlist-nt.(4) Insanity associated with alcoholism:  ii) The following factors should not be regarded as unfavourable la man&apos;s claim for a pension :  coholism following great mental or physical exhaustion, head pry, concussion, sunstroke, debilitating illness or fever,  lie result^ nar service.ill) The following factors should be taken as unfavourable to a iu&apos;s claim for a pension:  Definite evidence that, prior to enlistment, he had had an attack of &apos;irium firm ens or been otherwise mentally affected as the result of oholie excess, or that he had been drinking heavily for a consider-ie period prior to enlistment or during his service.Ipkn&apos;sions Ministry, August, 1917,MEDICAL BOARDS ON NEURASTHENIC OFFICERS.It has been decided that all officers recommended for invaliding im the Army on account of shell shock, neurasthenia, functional Lvous disorders and epilepsy, shall, before their relinquishment is Lily decided upon, be examined by the Special Medical Board of leers of the R.A.M.C., whose headquarters are at 78, Lancaster lie. London, W. 2.When, therefore, a medical board is of the opinion that an officer1) is suffering from one of the above-mentioned disorders is not Jy to be fit for any further military service, the president will at e foi &quot;ward all medical documents of the officer as follows:_(a) In the London District, to the President of the SpecialMedical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.(b) In other Commands, to the D.D.M.S. of the Command, whowill arrange for the documents to be available for the. Special Medical Board when examining the officer.
He will at the same time forward a nominal roll of all such cases which are not considered fit for further military ser-viee, giving the diagnosis of the disability, and the address of the officer, to the President of the Special ISIbSical Board.3. The President of the Special Medical Board will arrange, in the case of officers in the London District with the officer in charge of the hospital concerned, and in the case of other commands with the D.D.M.S. of the command, for the officers attendance. The Board will examine the officer and, if they approve of his invaliding from the service; add their report and assess the officer&apos;s physical disable-ment in lOths, i.e., 100 per cent, or total; 80 per cent., 60 per cent. &amp;c, and forward all medical documents to the Secretary, War Office. If the Special Medical Board is of the opinion that the officer should not be invalided out of the Service they will record their recommenda-tions on A.F. A. 45, and return the medical documents to the D.D.M.S. of the Command in which the officer is situated, who will immediately arrange to carry out the recommendations of the Special Medical Board. The President, Special Medical Board, will send one -copy of the report to the Secretary, War Office.The Special Medical Board will also record their opinion whether the disability is the result of service in the present war, and whether the officer is permanently and wholly disabled and unfit for military service or not, so that the names of officers exempted from the pro-visions of the Military Service (Review of Exceptions) Act. 1917, may be duly noted.The President of the Special Medical Board will forward at the end of each month to the Secretary, War Office (D.R. 1), a list of the names and addresses of those officers recommended for invaliding.4. Unless the Special Medical Board otherwise advise, the officer will remain in hospital, command depot, or unit, pending instructions from the War Office as to his disposal.5. The following arrangements will be made for the examination of these cases by the Special Medical Board:  (a) All cases from hospitals or units in the London District willattend by arrangement at 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2. unless unfit to travel.(b) A visiting unit of the Special Medical Board will be detailedfor service in each Command except the London District. The President of the Special Medical Board may- arrange with the D.D.M.S. of the Command for cases awaiting examination to be col-lected at a convenient centre ready for the visit of the Board, the date of which will be notified by the President.6. In the case of the special hospitals for neurasthenic officers at Craiglockhart, Palace Green, 4th London General Hospital, and Mag-hull, the President of the Special Medical Board will arrange direct with the officer in charge for the examination of officers recommended for invaliding.7. Re-examination of officers invalided for one of the. above dis-abiljties, with a view to the renewal of their retired pay, will be ar-ranged at the request of the Ministry of Pensions by the President of
the Special Medical Board, who will communicate., if necessary, with the Deputy Director of Medical Services of the Command. These examinations should be carried out and reports forwarded with the leasif possible delay through the President&apos; of the Special Medical Board to the Ministry of Pensions.24/Gen.No./58(33 (A.M.D. 3).SPECIAL MEDICAL BOARD TO EXAMINE ALL SOLDIERS BROUGHT FORWARD FOR DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY ON ACCOUNT OF SHELL-SHOCK, NEURASTHENIA AND FUNCTIONAL NERVOUS DISORDERS, EPILEPSY.1-.&quot; In view of the important work this Board has been able to per-form in the London District, it is considered advisable to extend its functions to all commands. A.C.Is. 2208 and 2393 of 1916 are there-fore cancelled and the following substituted.2. A Special Medical Board of Officers of the R.A.M.C. has been established to examine soldiers who are recommended for discharge from the army as medically unfit, where the condition is diagnosed as shell-shock, neurasthenia, functional nervous disorders, or epilepsy.The Address of this Board is 78, Lancaster Gate.London, W. 2.3. Invaliding and Travelling Medical Boards will continue to examine and report on cases of this type, but all such cases reconi-mended for discharge will be brought, as soon as possible after they have passed the Invaliding or Travelling Medical Board, before the Special Medical Board for approval. The Special Board will, in addi-tion to approval, co-ordinate experience of this class of case, and de-termine whether any particular case is one in which the grant of a final gratuity would be suitable, or whether a temporary pension should be recommended.In cases where the Special Board are of opinion that the man has recovered and is fit for military service, or there is a reasonable prob-ability of his becoming fit under further treatment, they will record their opinion, together with any required recommendations, and send the papers to the D.D.M.S. of the command concerned, who will com-municate with the Officer i/c Hospital or O.C. Command Depot or Unit.4. The establishment of the Special Medical Board will involve in these cases some deviation from the procedure laid down in A.C.I. 1912 of 1916; thus, the President of the Special Board, or the Presi-derit of a Visiting Unit of the Special Medical Board and not the President of the Invaliding or Travelling Medical Board, will be the approving officer in such cases.5. The Presidents of the Invaliding or Travelling Medical Boards which have examined and reported upoa these cases will forward all
iihe documents enumerated in para. B. 1 (a) of A.C.is. 2068 and 2009 of 1916, as follows :  (i) In the London District, to the President of the Sped;Medical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2. ^(ii) In other Commands, to the D.D.M.S. of the Command, whq will arrange for the documents to be available for tM Special Medical Board when examining the men. They will at the same time forward a nominal roll of all such cases -which are recommended for discharge, giving the diagnosis of the dis ability and the whereabouts of the patient, -to the President of tin Special Medical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.6. The President of the Special Medical Board will arrange in tl (case of the London District with the Officer i/c Central Hospital cerned, and in the case of other Commands with the D.D.M.S. of t Command (sec para. 8) for the soldiers&apos; attendance.The Board will examine the soldier, and if they approve his ,] charge from the service, add their report and award of gratuity recommendation of pension to A.F.

If the Special Medical Board are of opinion that the man shon not be discharged from the service, they will deal with the case as In down in para. 3 of this instruction.7. Unless the Special Medical Board otherwise advise, the sol will be retained in hospital, command depot or unit until the day m which his discharge from the army takes effect, when he will be sen -to his home, or to an Institution if this has been arranged for.8. The following arrangements will be made for the examinati -of these cases by the Special Medical Board:  (a) All cases from hospitals in the London District will attendarrangement at 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.(b) A visiting unit of the Special Medical Board will be detailifor service in each Command except the London District The President of the Special Medical Board will arranp with the D.Ds.M.S. of the Commands for the case awaiting examination to be collected at a convenient- centi or centres ready for the Board&apos;s visit, the date of wine&apos; will be notified to him by the President.In large hospital areas, where the collection and tem porary accommodation of the cases may be difficult, tli Special Medical Board may arrange to visit such Iocs centres as may be specially adapted for the purpose. &apos;(c) In the Scottish Command, the President of the Scott h Visiting Unit of the Special Medical Board will arrang with the D.D.M.S. for the cases awaiting examination t be collected at a convenient centre or centres ready for tli

Cases ofshell-shock, neurasthenia, &amp;c, about to be discharged from the Ciord Derby &quot;War Hospital, Warrington, will be sent to Maghuli for examination by the Special Medical Board. In the case of these hospitals the documents will be for-warded direct to the President of the Special Medical Board.9. D.Ds.M.S. of Commands will arrange for cases which have been referred by the Ministry of Pensions for the opinion of the Special Medical Board, to be collected at the centres referred to in para. 8 for examination by the Special Medical Board when visiting the centre.10. Medical Boards examining discharged soldiers who are already in receipt of a pension, and who may- be suffering from any of the dis-abilities indicated in this A.C.I., are at liberty to refer such cases, through the D.D.M.S. of the Command, to the Special Medical Boards. The D.D.M.S. will arrange for the collection of these cases as in para 9.24/Gen.No./5637 (A.M.D. 2).

APPENDIX VIMReport on Schemes etc, submitted during the week ending 10th October 1917,1.        The Peterborough Local Gorrlttee submitted a scheme for institutional treatment for discharged Den in their area comprising treatment at Hilton Hall V.A.D.Hospital, the Peterborough Infirmary the Northampton War Hospital and the Hunstanton Convalescent Hone (the latter at schedule rates) have been sanctioned, but further enquiries are being made as to the arrangements for fees with the Hilton Hall V.A.D,Hospital and the Peterborough Infirmary.2.        The Worcestershire Local Committee submitted a verycomprehensive scheme embodying the use of a large number ofmilitary hospitals, and of several institutions situated in thecounty as well as of several special hospitals outside the countyarea.     Treatment in the military hospitals and in the followinginstitutions has been approvedi-1,   The St. John1a Brine Baths, Droitwich at a fee of Sl.ls.0d, for two weeks.2,   The Metropolitan Convalescent Home, Bexhill? at a fee of  2.12s.6d. for three weeks,3.   The Royal West of England Sanatorium, at a fee of 31/- for two weeks,40   The Birmingham &amp; Midland Ear and Throat Hospital forin-patient and out-patient treatment at schedule rates,5,   The Birmingham General Hospital for in-patient treatment at schedule rates.Further enquiries have been made as to the fees payablein the other institutions set forth in the scheme in order that itmay be decided whether sanction can be given to their use also,3.        The Denbighshire Local Committee have asked for sanctionto the use of a large&apos; number of military hospitals and otherinstitutions situated within the area of their county and theadjoining counties.     The use of the Denbighshire Infirmary at therate
rate of 3/9 per day and the   rexham and Chester Infirmaries at schedule rates has been sanctioned for In-patient treatment, The provision of out-patient electrical, or X-Ray treatment was sanctioned in the case of the Denbighshire Infirmary at a charge of 2/6 for the first visit and 1/6 for each subsequent visit, and enquiry has been made as to whether this institution would not agree to provide ordinary out-patient treatment at the authorised rates.     The Llandrindod V-ells Cottage Hospital at a charge of 3/6 per day, the Royal Devonshire Hospital, Buxton, and the Highland Moors Hospital, Llandrindod Wells, were sanctioned for the treatment of rheumatism, the charges In all cases being within the scheduled rates.     The Committee propose to provide convalescent treatment at the John Jones Convalescent Home, Rhyl, and the Rhoscolyn Home, Anglesey, in neither of v/hich institutions are any fees required, and this proposal has been sanctioned. The Committee also propose to include the D?vid Lewis Northern Hospital, Liverpool, in their scheme; as this institution has a special neurological section, and as treatment for this class of case cannot be provided within the area of the county, the proposal is being sanctioned,4,      The Vvolverhampton Local Committee reported that the North Staffordshire General Infirmary had now accepted the terr.:s laid down in Schedule I and it was hoped that the Eye Infirmary would shortly agree! also.     The use cf the former hospital has therefore been approved.5.        The South Hales Joint Advisory Committee have forwarded a letter from the Llandrindod Sub-Committee asking for approval to a proposal to establish an Institution under the superintendence of the medical officer of the Rock Spa Llilitary Hospital, on the ground that men under treatment there frequently require a suitable occupation to assist their cure.     It is
suggested that if sufficient discharged soldiers could be sent to some institution in which they could be trained in trades or occupations such as motor driving, motor mechanism, massage, electrical treatment, etc. the superintendent of the military hospital would endeavour to establish such an institution, and would also, where necessary, arrange for the treatment of the men undergoing such training.     It is not clear whether -this proposal is primarily one of treatment or training, and whether the proposed training is with a view to establishing a centre for training disabled men in suitable industries in order that they may ultimately obtain permanent employment in the industry in which they are instructed.   Further enquiries have been addressed to the Committee on these points.6.        The use by the Derby Local Committee of the Southport Hydropathic Hospital at the rate of 26/- per week with l/- for special baths, and of the Royal Northern Sea Bathing Infirmary at schedule rates, by the Todmorden Local Committee has been sanctioned.7.        The Preston Local Committee have been authorised to uso the Moor Park V,A,D.Hospital for special out-patient treatment consisting of massage, X-Ray, electrical, sand any other special treatment, at schedule rates,8.        The Staffordshire Local Committee have submitted a proposal to utilise the services of the nurses of the Stafford-shire County Nursing Association in cases where special nursing is required,     This has been sanctioned on the understanding that the treatment is more than a panel doctor is required to give under.the terms of his agreement, and that the fees payable do not exceed 1/- for the first and 6d. for each subsequent visit.9.       The Luton Local Committee have represented that the system for the provision of massage treatment in their area hasentailed

It has been necessary to send all such men to j the Bedford Military Hospital, but it is now pointed out that the SJardovm V.A.D.Hospital has for some time past utilised the services of a local masseur for the treatment of serving soldiers.

- AFPEM-D1X-XTREaT^NT.Llemorandum on Discharged Soldiers in Public Asylums.Although ths number of,/soldiers, who have boon discharged from the Army on account of insanity and are being treated in County and Borough asylums, is not very large, it has been difficult to make arrangements for them vhich are in accordance with public sentiment.     The Ministry of Pensions has always sought to treat those men in the most liberal and humane spirit, but it has felt obliged to provide that men who had been in an asylum before en-listrrtcnt and whose subsequent insanity and discharge 7!ere not attributable to or aggravated by military service, should not become a charge upon the Department as &quot;Service Patients&quot;,      But for the existence of this -class of cases and the necessity of distinguishing between them and &quot;Service Patients,&quot; the problem would have been simple.Servlse Patients.All other men discharged for insanity and placed in asylums become Service Patients as soon as their cases have been investigated and their status determined.     This takes about.a fortnight and it has now been arranged that in the interval between admission and definite allocation to the position of Service or non-Service Patients, ALL KEN shall be paid for as private patients by the Pensions Departments     They will be taken to the asylums under Military escort and be clearly distinguished from Poor Law patients.     By these provisions the real grievance of soldiers being apparently Poor Law patients for a fortnight or so until their status could be determined has been removed.     As soon as a man has been classed as a Service Patient - which means all men except those who have been in asylums before enlistment and whose subsequent insai ity is not the result of their service -he is maintained by the Department as a Private paying-patinnt and received 2s,6d. a week for pocket money.     He wears clothes distinguishing him from the Poor Law patients and a military badge If he has a rife and family they -receive the same pension and allowances (on the highest scale) as if he had been killed in action.The arrangement under which all men arc paid for as private patients until their status has been determined has been approved by the Treasury.     It removes a great difficulty.     It would have been most inhuman to haveput all men at once into the Service class and then to have degraded a few of them subsequently when it was found that they were not entitled to be there.     Now, after two or three weeks at most, they arc elevated to the full Service class or become Poor Law patients for the reasons already described.
The Use of Public Asylums.It has been urged in many quarters that public County or Borough Asylums should under no circumstances &quot;fee used for the treatment of discharged soldiers.     It is argued that they involve a &quot;pauper taint&quot;.     These is, in fact, no more a &quot;pauper taint&quot; about these asylums than about Sanatoria built and maintained by the same authorities. One might point out :,that there are a large number of all kinds of civilian paying patients in theso hospitals and that the Service Patients, who&apos;are private Stato-maintained patients, are on the same footing as these civilian patients.     The alternative to the use of public asylums is the establishment of a few special institutions for treating soldiers discharged for insanity.     At present these men are scattered in twos and threes all over the Kingdom in districts accessible to their friends.     If they were all placed in a few central institutions their relatives, cut off from them by perhaps hundreds of miles and even, in the case of Irish patients, by water - would complain bitterly.
Telephone: Victoria 8452-3.Telegraphic Address: ,,^rpension, Parl., London.&quot;Rep1-/ should be addressed to jje secretary, Ministry of Pensions, and the following number quotedMINISTRY  OF PENSIONS, Secretary&apos;s Office,8TMIN8TER HOUSE,Great George Street,MILLBANK,iN, S.W. u London&apos; s&apos;w*3.1October. 1917.Dear Sir or uadam,Correspondence with Local Comamittees has shown that there are a certain number of disabled men for whom light work is stated to be required, but it is alleged that work of this kind is very difficult to obtain.     The Llinister is anxious to learn by what means&quot; the requirements of men of this class can be met and in order to do so he would be very glad if you would favour him with your views after consultation with the Disablement Committee.In :order In the first instawoe to ascertain the scope of the problem to be dealt with the Minister would be obliged if you would give him as full a reply as possible to the following questions:-1,     It&apos; Is necessary tc distinguish between those men y/hose condition temporarily makes them unfit for anything but light work but who will probably recover a normal working capacity later on and those whose permanent condition will prevent them doing anything but light work.    If an effort Is to be made to secure permanent  1light work&apos; it should clearly be confined to the second of these classes.What in your experience is the number of men who will permanently require, light work?     V.&apos;hat special forms (if any) of disablement in your experience appear to need light work?2. It is not clear what is precisely meant by &apos;light work.&apos; &quot;Light work&apos; may mean work that does not involve heavy physical strain or it may mean work that is merely not continu-ous (e.g. watchman or timekeeper), or, again, work that admits of interruption (e.g. for a few days in a week). Again there is the kind of light work which is provided by home -industries, such as basket making.V/hat forms of light work that would fit any or all of these descriptions do you loiow of* that would be open to dis-abled men?     It may be that at the present moment there is very little light work, but in normal times there is always a certain amount,  and the i-iinister would be glad to have suggestions.     For which of the forms of light work that you can suggest is a preliminary training necessary?3.     Have any of the men, whose condition is such that they wili permanently be unable to do anything but 1light work&apos; found such work through your Committee or otherwise?     If so, $hat form of work have they got?4.     Has your Committee made any concerted attempt by can-vassing employers to obtain permanent light work for any disabled men?
5.      The obvious way of finding light employment is bycanvassing individual employers, but. can you suggest any more general plan?     Would it be of advantage to eonsult Federations of Employers, and if so what general suggestion would be made tc them so that for a particular description of job, e.g. messenger or watchman they could be induced to a^ree to obtain their man always from this class cf disabled men through your Committee or otherwise,     It must be remembered that whatever the number of light work cases now when employment is so easily obtaned, the number will be much larger after the war.Any general observation on. the problem as it presents itself in your own locality would be welcomed.     It may be well that in particular industries&apos; or districts light work has been successfully found - for examplef Ral lway Companies and Mining Companies but it understood provided light work of a continuous but net exacting nature for men formerly in their employ who have returned unable to resume their old j-bs.     To a certain extent the same process has taken place on larger estate   in the County,     The. problem, therefore; probably concerns training the man who was in general industry and whose previous enplcyer has light work to offer.Yours very truly.

PREFACE.Tins Report is one pi&apos; a series which is being issued by the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collabora-tion with the Ministry of Pensions and has been prepared by the Trade Advisory Committee (Leather Goods Trade). The infor-mation is intended not only for the use of Local War Pensions Committees,. Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Institutes, and Military Hospitals, but also for the use of Employers and Workpeople, and any who are interested in the problem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as Id the Trades and Industrial processes in their areas which are especially suitable for disabled men. This Series of Reports is confined to trades which are to be found in. every part of the country, or which cover a much wider area than that of any single Local Committee. The information collected for this Report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed know-ledge which Local Committees have already in their possession or will be able to acquire in regard to their own local conditions.Trade Advisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers).A Trade Advisory Committee has been set up by the Ministry of Labour in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, to advise these Departments as to the conditions under which the training of disabled men in this Trade can best be given, the besi methods of training, the suitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformity in the training of,disabled men. The Com-mittee consists of an equal number of representatives nominated by Associations of Employers and &quot;of Workpeople, and is con-stituted as follows :  -Associations of Employers.3 Representatives nominated by the National Leather Goods Manufacturers&apos; Association.-   1 Representative nominated by the Birmingham Leather Traders&apos; Association.1 Representative nominated by the Walsall Leather Traders&apos; Association.Associations of Workpeople.3 Representatives nominated by the Midland Leather Trades Federation.2 Representatives nominated by the Amalgamated Portmau-teau, Bag and Fancy Leather -Workers&apos; Trade Society.In addition a representative of the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour, and also a representative of the Ministry of Pensions attend the meetings in a consultative capacity, with-oul tlie right to vote.
THE LEATHER GOODS TRADE.t.....:!; PART I. :General Remarks.The manufacture of Leather Goods is almost wholly concentrated in two districts: London, where 60 per cent, of the trade is carried on, and Birmingham and Walsall, which account jointly for 30 per cent. The trade is only slightly seasonal. In Solid find Fancy Leather activity is rather aboA^e the average in the autumn and. below in the late spring,. but there is not much unemployment. In trunk-making spring is the busy time. Night work is practically unknown.Fancy Leather Goods and the lighter kinds of Solid Leather Hoods offer light rwork, but require dexterity and adaptability, and sometimes give scope for individual intelligence and artistic iaste.   Trunk making is rather heavier.   &apos;      .In the Fancy and Solid Leather Goods trade Avomen are often employed side by side with men.The material is valuable and easily spoiled. This means that (raining is expensive, and a preliminary period of teaching in a iechnical school is strongly recommended.Note. Leather works which is subsidiary to other trades is being.dealt with in other reports: e.g., Boot Making and Boot Repairing, in the reports on those trades.; Leather Bookbinding under Printing and Allied Trades; etc., etc.BRANCHES GENERALLY SUITABLE.I.- (a) Fancy Leather Goods.(b) Solid Leather&apos; Goods (oilier than Trunks and Foitnnanteawi)Fancy Leather Goods include, dressing cases, purses, pocket-books, dog-leads, ladies&apos; hand-bags, and other articles in which the edges of the leather are turned over. Solid Leather Goods is the term applied to articles which are made of leather in which the edges are not turned over. It includes&quot; ordinary bags, attache cases, nien&apos;s &quot; portsea &quot; purses, etc.Suitability. For general work a man must be able to stand, though the small Fancy Leather work can be done sitting. Free use of thumbs, fingers and wrists is required and some arm move-ment. The loss of one or two fingers, however, would not. necessarily [disqualify. Eyesight must be fairly good. Condi-tions are normal and the work is light. It would be suitable for a man who is handy and intelligent but incapable of enduring physical strain. Solid Leather work is usually a little heavier than Fancy Leather work.Prospects:-There is likely to be a.brisk demand after the Avar, though this depends to some extent on the course of foreign trade, both import and export.

particular, lias been largely neglected in England, having been mostly in the bands of Germans and Austrians before tbe war.There is at. present a. considerable shortage of workers, and stocks are depleted. Women have been trained and employed during the war. At Walsall, -moreover, there is a scheme for teaching tbe light-leather trades to workers displaced by the pro-gressive decline in saddlery and harness-making. The prospects for handy and intelligent men, however, are said to be very good, particularly in the more skilled work. There are a large number of openings available for trained disabled men in London, Walsall and Birmingham.II.-Trunk-M&quot;airing.This includes the heavier kinds of bags and trunks, from a portable suit-case upwards. -Suitability. The work requires the full use of shoulders, arms and hands, though not necessarily all the fingers. It is usually done sitting, though the worker must be able to stand for part of the day. While seated, moreover, he must be able to grip the work between his legs. It has, however, been done successfully by men with one wooden leg above the knee. It involves a good deal of bending and reaching forward.   Fair eyesight is needed.The work varies with the size of the trunks, but for the. most part may be described as neither heavy nor light, but medium.Prospects. There was but little unemployment before the war, and it is anticipated that there will be a steady demand for men. The future naturally depends partly on tbe course of foreign trade. A large number of tbe men who have enlisted are being employed on army leather work, so that tbe number returning is likely to be above tbe average.PART II. TRAINING.The Leather Goods Trade has been declared by the Minister of Pensions to be a Special Trade for the purpose of Instruc-tion 23 issued under Article 6 of tbe Royal Warrant of March, .1917, and the following additional instructions have been issued by the Minister of Pensions to Local War Pensions Committees to regulate tbe training of disabled sailors and soldiers in the trade: -Instructions Issued by the Minister of Pensions to Regulate the Training of Disabled Sailors and Soldiers in the Leather Goods Trade.In order that the training of disabled men may be so regu-lated as not to conflict with the interests of employers and employed in the above-mentioned trade, the Minister of Pensions has, after consultation with the Ministry of Labour and the Trade Advisory Committee concerned, laid down (in accordance with Instruction 23 issued under Article 0 of the Royal Warrant of
March&quot;; 1917) the following conditions to be observed in regard io the training of men in the Leather Goods Trade j henceforth io be deemed a &quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes of that Instruction: .Any course of training already being given or proposed to be given by a Local War Pensions Committee, shall, if the allow-ances or fees under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are to be paid, comply with the following conditions unless, . in any case, the Minister of Pensions otherwise determines :,- (1) Training may be given by: the Local War Pensions Com-mittee either in a technical school under a scheme approved by tbe Minister of Pensions, or in a factory or workshop.(2) The maximum period of training shall be six &apos; months, whether in a technical school or in a factory or workshop.(3) The iirst month of training shall be a trial period. If at the end of this period the man is considered unsuitable for the trade, bis training shall cease. In the case of training in a factory or workshop the employer shall agree at the; end of the trial period, if the man proves suitable for the trade, to retain him in his factory until the end of the course of training,(4) Where the training is given in a factory the employer shall undertake to pay the disabled man wages according to the following scale:  1st and 2nd month, 7s. Qd. per week.3rd and 4th month, 11s. 3d. per week.5th and 6th month, 155. per week. - -(5) In addition, the employer shall undei*take to give to the disabled man at the completion of the period of training a gratiiity in the form of a.kit of tools to the value of  5j irrespective of the bonus payable by the Ministry of Pensions. - 1 &apos;Local Technical Advisory Committee... .&apos; (6) Where any training has been approved by the Minister of Pensions in the above-mentioned trade, and where the&apos; Minister;-6&apos;f Labour on the advice of the Trade Advisory Committee (Leather Goods Trade) has set up for the area in which, training..is to, be given a Local Technical Advisory. Committee consisting of. an equal number of representatives of Associations of Employers, and of Workpeople, then, provided such Committee... is... recognised, by the Minister of Pensions, after consultation with the; Minister, of Labour, as representative of the Trade in that area, the Local War Pensions Committee by whom the training has been arranged shall consult the Local Technical Advisory Committee with regard to the following points :  . (a) The selection of candidates for training, having, regard to their suitability for the training. ..   -(b) The suitability of the training offered. in the technical school or similar institute.- (c) The suitability of any requests made by employers to the Local War Pensions Committee in whose area&apos;&quot;the
training- is being provided for tbe supply of men for : employment after training, with; special reference to tbe prospects of. permanent employment and tbe rate of wages offered at tbe termination of tbe training.(d) The suitability of tbe training offered in factories and&quot;workshops,; with special reference to the prospects of permanent employment and the rate, of wages offered . at the termination of the training.(e) Any other technical points arising out of tbe training ofdisabled men for this trade.(7) The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall inform the Local War Pensions Committee and the Trade Advisory Qom-mittee&quot; (Leather Goods Trade) if, at any time, in their opinion a siiffioient number of men have been trained, having regard to the number of men which the trade in the area-with which they are familiar can reasonably be expected to absorb.N/.B._Instruction 4 above should be read in connection withSchedule IV,&apos;^paragraph 7 to be found on page 21 of the Instruc-tions on the Training and Treatment of. disabled men under Article 6 of the Royal Warranipf March 29th, 19,17, which runs as&apos;follows:- - ., , ,   -   u, s       .!.,..Tbe employer shall during any part of tbe period of train-ing pay the man-such wage, if any, as represents the net value of the manVwork.-to. the employer, aud.the allowance paid to the man under.Instruction 34 shall be.reduced by tbe amount of such wage or any portion thereof.  , -Thus for instance a- disabled man with no children who was beings trained in, Leather Goods Work. ins a factory or workshop would receive during the first two months of his training,20s;. a week from his Local War Pensions Committee and 7s. 6d. from his employer; duriiYg the third and fourth months 16.?. 3d. from his Local. Committee and 11s. 3^. from his employer,.and during the fifth and sixth months 12s. 6^. from his Local Committee and 15s. i from bis employer. &apos;During the whole six months of training, whether in the technical school or in the factory or workshop, the inan&apos;s pension is temporarily withdrawn and he receives instead the full Main-tenan.ce Allowance. At the termination of the period of training the disabled man immediately receives bis pension again.Approved Courses of Training.Courses for tbe Training of disabled Sailors and. Soldiers in the Leather Goods Trade have been approved by. tbe Minister of Pensions at tbe following Technical Schools:  -London.-Cordwainer&apos;s College, ( Fancy Leather., 42, Bethnal Green Road, E.      ... I Solid Leather. Walsall&apos;.-School of Art, Goodiill Street      ...  Fancy Leather.
yLocal War Pensions Committees who desire to send disabled men to be trained at these Centres should communicate-with the Secretaries of the London and the Walsall Local War Pensions Committees, respectively.HOURS OP WORK.The hours are usually about 54 per week, with some overtime when busy.. WAGES.Men who are fully trained and competent can earn the following rates:- .. ,  .Eancy  Leather    )Solid    Leather    V   36/- to 42/-Trunk   Making    J. Advisory Wages Boards.The Minister of Labour&apos;is setting up Advisory Wages Boards in the principal towns to advise as to the -question of&apos;,; the wages which should be paid to in dividual disabled&apos; men, taking into consideration the nature of &quot;their disability.-H Any workman or employer in the district can obtain the advice of the,Board as.to the rate of wag*es which an individual disabled mini - should be paid for performing certain specified work. The Boards are instructed to have regard to the current rate of wages for similar work in the district and to the capacity of the man whose case they are considering to do such work. They are not to have regard to any pension to which the man may be at the time entitled.The question of the wages to be paid to disabled men who have received training through a Local War Pensions Committee will raise problems of a special nature on which the Local Technical Advisory Committee (see Instruction 6 (c) and (d)) will have expert knowledge and it has therefore been decided by the Minister of Labour that the Advisory Wages Board shall only deal with the case of a disabled man who has been trained or who is being trained by a Local War Pensions Committee upon a specific request by the Local War Pensions Committee concerned or with the expressed concurrence of that Committee.Maintenance During Training.A disabled man, if eligible to be given training by his Local War Pensions Committee, may receive during the course of training an allowance of 27s. (id. (more, if he has been a non-commissioned officer), with additional allowances;&apos;fOr children at the rate of 5s. for the first; As.&apos; 2d. for the second; 3s. 4d. for  the   third,, and.  2s.

(more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) is given for iiis wife, together with children&apos;s allowances at the rate mentioned above. In addition to this any fees in respect of training will be paid by the Minister, and at the end of it an amount equal to 5s. for each week the training lasted will be paid by the Ministry to the man as a bonus for satisfactory attendance.APPLICATIONS FOR DISABLED MEN.Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wishing to be trained, or from employers wishing to train such &quot;disabled men, should be addressed to the Local War Pensions Committee for the area in which the applicant resides.ENQUIRIES.Any questions upon which a Local War Pensions Committee may be in doubt should be referred by them to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W.1. &apos;: Any suggestions or enquiries other than those from Local &apos;War Pensions Committees arising out of the technical matters dealt. :with in this Report should be addressed to the Trade : Advisory; Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors  and  Soldiers), &quot;Employment&apos; Department,  Ministry of Labour,  Queen Anne Chambers,&apos;Westminster, S.W.1.I,;];&quot; LONDON:Printed jinder the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office .;  By DARLING and SON, Limited, Bacon Street, E.2.1917.

PREFACE.This report is one of a series which is being- issued by the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour, in collabora-tion with the Ministry of Pensions, and has been prepared by the Trade Advisory Committee (Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making, Boot and Shoe Repairing and Clog Making and Repairing Trades). The information is intended not only for the use of Local War Pensions Committees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Institutes, and Military Hospitals, but also for the use of employers and workpeople, and any who are interested in the problem of the training of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local. War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as to the Trades and Industrial processes in their areas which are especi-ally suitable for disabled men. This series of reports is confined to trades which are to be found in every part of the country or which cover a much wider area than that of any single Local Committee. The information collected for this report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed knowledge which Local Committees have already in their possession or will be able to acquire with regard to their own local conditions.TRADE ADYISORY COMMITTEE.A Trade Advisory Committee has been set up by the Ministry of Labour in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions to advise these Departments as to the conditions under which the training of disabled men in this trade can best be given, the best methods of training, the suitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformity in the training of disabled men. The Committee consists of an equal number of representatives nominated by Associations of Employers and of Workpeople, and is constituted as follows:  Associations of Employers.The National Federation of Boot Trades Associations, Limited.The West End Master Boot Makers&apos; Association. The Co-operative Wholesale Society, Limited. The Amalgamated Society of Master Cloggers.Associations of Workpeople.The National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. The Amalgamated Society of Boot and Shoe Makers. The London and Provincial Union of Hand-sewn Bootand Shoe Makers. The Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Cloggers.

HAND-SEWN BOOT AND SHOE MAKING AND BOOT AND &apos; SHOE REPAIRING.PART I.GENERAL REMARKS.:Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making is chiefly carried on in. the West End of London and in other large cities, It serves a limited but steady demand, and, where the necessary skill can be acquired, it has the distinct advantage that the work can be done in a man&apos;s own time, either in ,his own home or in a workshop rented by a few men conjointly. Disabled men have been already trained successfully in this branch of the work at the Cordwainers&apos; College, Bethnal Green, London.Boot and Shoe Repairing is one of the most widely distributed of trades; every place of any size has its repairers, and openings may, therefore, present themselves near the homes of disabled men.It is carried on either (i) by hand alone, or (ii) with the aid of two or three machines, or (iii) in large factories. At present the greater part is done by machines in small or medium-sized work-shops. Repairing by hand alone is still done, however, on a large scale. This includes (a) repairing in villages, (b) repairing- in towns both in medium-class work and in high-class work. The factory system is said to be likely to grow in or near large towns.Both in Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making and in Boot and Shoe Repairing special care should be exercised before any offer from employers to teach disabled men is accepted, to ensure that both efficient teaching and adequate prospects are forthcoming. The men suitable for employment fall into two main classes:- (i) those not able to stand continuously at their work, (ii) those able to stand continuously.The men in class (i) should be taught band boot and shoe making and repairing in all branches, and riveting and finishing. Men in class (ii) should be taught hand boot and shoe making and hand repairing as the best introduction to machine boot and shoe repairing. At the same time, they should also be taught the use of the machines used in the repairing trade, in view of the fact that a large amount of repairing is already done by machinery and that this method may possibly grow in the future.SUITABILITY OF THE WORK FOR DISABLED MEN. The following is a list of the processes suitable for disabled men:  1. Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making.2. Hand Repairing.3. Machine Repairing :  (a) Bench work.(b) Machine stitching and sewing (repairing only).   -(c) Finishing. - - .-4. Clogging (a separate report is being prepared for this trade).(130S7-14 a.)   Wt. 814-325.   5000.   10/17.   D &amp; S.   (J. 4.
PROCESSES. r1. Hand-seion Boot and Shoe Making and (2) Hand Repairing.  This work can be done sitting and would be quite suitable for a one-legged man. Full use of both hands and arms is needed, but the loss of one or two fingers would not necessarily disqualify. Good eyesight is required. Men suffering from shell shock may in some cases be likely to find this a suitable occupation, but it is not recommended for men with a tendency to consumption.3. Machine Repairing. This includes three processes, viz., (a) Bench Work, (o) Machine Stitching and Sewing (Repairing only), and (c) Einishing.(a) Bench Work. Comprises tbe taking- off of the old sole and top piece of the heel, including channelling soles ready for stitch-ing or blake sewing, or inserting rivets if the repair is not being sewn or stitched; also inserting rivets in the top of the heel. It is done either standing or sitting, but in other respects the require-ments are the same as those for hand making and hand repairing.(b) Machine Stitching, as a process of repairing, consists of operating the Sole-sewing Machine in cases where the sole has been channelled for that purpose. It is done standing, and often a treadle has to be compressed by the right leg to start the machine and held down during the operation. Both hands are required to hold and guide the boot. The work is light and there would be only slight vibration.(c) Finishing boots and shoes by machinery is principally done while standing, but the machine can also be adapted so as to be worked while sitting. It requires the \ise of both arms and bands, but little or no movement of the legs or body. The work is not heavy but it is not recommended for a man with a weak heart or a tendency to consumption.PROSPECTS.The demand at present is good, but it must be remembered that the vacancies created by Avar casualties are likely to be less in this trade than in some other trades, owing to tbe number of enlisted men who are employed behind the fighting lines upon boot repairing.PART II. TRAINING.Tbe Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making and Boot and Shoe Re-pairing Trades, including all the operations commonly accepted in tbe trade, have been declared by the Ministry of Pensions to be a Special Trade for the purposes of Instruction 23 issued under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, and the following additional Instructions have been issued by the Minister
of Pensions to Loual War Pensions Committees to regulate tlie training of disabled sailors and soldiers in tbe Trade:  INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY THE MINISTER OE PENSIONS TO REGULATE THE TRAINING OE DISABLED MEN IN THE HAND-SEWN BOOT AND SHOE MAKING AND BOOT AND SHOE REPAIRING TRADES.In order that tbe training of disabled men may be so regulated as not to conflict with the interests of employers and employed in tbe above-mentioned trades, tbe Minister of Pensions has, after consultation with the Minister of Labour and the Trade Advisory Committee concerned^ laid down (in accordance with Instruction 23 under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of March, 1917) tbe following conditions to be observed in regard to tbe training of disabled men in the Hand-Sewn Boot and Shoe Making and Boot and Shoe Repairing Trades, henceforth to be deemed a &quot; Special Trade &quot; for the purposes of that Instruction.Any course of training already being given or proposed to be given by a Local. War Pensions Committee shall, if the allowances or fees under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are to be paid, comply with the following conditions, unless, in any case, tbe Minister of Pensions otherwise determines.(1) The training for disabled sailors and soldiers in Hand-Sewn Boot and Shoe Making and Boot and Shoe Repairing shall be provided in technical schools or other training institutes under a scheme approved by the Minister of Pensions, or, in the exceptional circumstances mentioned below, in workshops in accordance with one or other of the following schemes:  (2) - Technical School Training.(a) The training shall be given in the day time in a tradetraining school for a period not exceeding twelve months.(b) In the exceptional case of Hand-Sewn Boot and ShoeMaking, where a man has been through a twelve months course in a Technical School or other approved Institute, the Ministry of Pensions is prepared in suitable cases, upon an application from a Local War Pensions Committee, to sanction, the payment of a fee of 7s. Qd. per week for a further period of six months to an approved instructor in a workshop in considera-tion for the time spent by him upon the tuition of the disabled man.(3) Workshop Training.(a) Training in Hand-Sewn Boot and Shoe-Making combinedwith Boot and Shoe Repairing.(i) In localities where, in the opinion of the Local War Pensions Committee, the disabled man cannot .  . conveniently attend a technical school as, for instance,in small towns or semi-rural districts, or
(ii) in localities where the Local War Pension Committee, after consultation with the Local Tech-nical Advisory Committee (see below), if such exists, are satisfied as to the desirability of an alternative method of training, the whole of the period of training may be given, in a workshop according to the following procedure:The period of training shall be eighteen months, during which the employer shall pay to the disabled man a minimum of :  10s. per week during the 1st 6 months. 15s. per week during the 2nd 6 months. 20s. per week during the 3rd 6 months. The maximum number of working hours shall be 52 hours per Aveek.(b) Training in Boot and Shoe Repairing only.Where training in Boot and Shoe Repairing only is desired the whole of the period of training may be g-iven in a workshop according to the following pro-cedure, provided that, in the opinion of the Local War Pensions Committee, after consultation with the Local Technical Advisory Committee, if such exists, tbe disabled man cannot conveniently attend a technical school.The period of training shall be twelve months, dur-ing the first six months of which the employer shall pay no wages to the disabled man, and during the second six months he shall pay to tbe disabled man the sum of 15s. per week.During the first six months the Minister of Pensions is prepared to authorise the Local War Pensions Committee to&apos; pay to the employer a training fee of 5s. per week; payable at the end of the.second, fourth and. sixth months.The maximum number of working hours shall be 52 hours per week.4. The first month of training shall be a trial period. It at the end of this period, the man is considered unsuitable for the trade, his training shall: cease. In the case of factory or work-shop training tbe employer shall agree at tbe end of tbe trial period, if the man proves suitable for the trade, to retain him in .bis workshop until the end of the course of training.(5) Where in the case of workshop training the employer pays to the disabled man a weekly sum in addition to the minimum wage mentioned in Instruction 3 (a) and (b) as a bonus for increased efficiency, such bomis or weekly sum shall not be taken into consideration in calculating the amount of the maintenance allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee. Local Technical Advisory Committees.(6) Where any training has been approved by the Minister of Pensions in tbe above-mentioned trades and where the Minister
N.B. Instruction 3 above should be read in connection with Schedule IV, paragraph 7, to be found on page 21 of the Instruc-tions on the Training and Treatment of Disabled Sailors and. Soldiers under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of 29th March, 1917, which reads as follows :-&quot;The employer shall, during any part of the period of training, pay the man such wage, if any, as represents the net value of the man&apos;s work to the employer and the allowance paid to the man under Instruction 34 should be reduced by the amount of such wage or any portion thereof.&apos;-&apos;Thus, for instance, in the case of workshop training in Hand-Sewn Boot and Shoe Making- combined with Boot and Shoefd&apos; Labour ou tbe advice of tbe Trade. Advisory Committee (Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making, Boot and Shoe Repairing, and Clog Making and Repairing Trades) has set rip for the area in which the training is to be given a Local Technical Advisory Committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives of associations of employers and workpeople respectively, then provided such Committee is recognised by the Minister of Pensions, after con-sultation with the Minister of Labour,- as representative of tbe trade in the area, the Local War Pensions Committee by whom the training has been arranged shall consult the Local Technical Advisory Committee with regard to the following points :  (a) The selection of candidates for training,: having regard to their siiitability for the trade.(b). The suitability of the training offered in the technical school or similar institute.(c) The suitability of any requests made by employers to the Local War Pensions Committee in whose area the training is being provided, for the supply of men for employment after training, with special, reference to the prospects of permanent employment and the rate of wages offered at the termination of the training.(cl) The suitability of the training offered in factories and workshops, with special reference to the prospects of permanent employment and the rate of wages offered at tbe termination of the training.(e) Any other technical points arising out of the training of disabled men for this trade.(7) The Local Technical Advisory Committee shall inform the Local War Pensions Committee and the Trade Advisory Com-mittee (Hand-sewn Boot and Shoe Making, Boot and Shoe Repairing, and Clog Making and Repairing Trades) if. at any time, in their opinion, a sufficient number of men have been &quot;trained, having regard to the number of men which the trade in the area with which they are familiar could reasonably be expected to absorb.
Repairing1 (see above Instruction (3) (a)) a disabled man with no children Avould receive, during tbe whole period of training, a minimum of 27s. 6d. per week made up as follows:  	Wages payable by the Employer.	Maintenance allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee.1 First six months   ...       ... \   10s. per week. Second six months...      ...     15s. Third six months......j   20s.      ,,		17s. 6d. per Aveek. 12s. 6d. 7s. 6d.Similarly, in the case of tbe Boot and Shoe Repairing only (see above Instruction (3) (b)) a disabled man with no children would receive during the whole period of training, a minimum of 27s. Qd. per week made up as follows:  			Wages payable by the Employer.	Maintenance allowance payable by the Local War P nsions Committee.First six months   ...       ... i          Nil. Second six months ...       ...     15s. per week. 1		27s. 6c?. per Aveek. 12s. 6c/.Instruction 5 also lays down that if the employer chooses to pay the disabled man more than tbe above-mentioned minimum Avage this would be an extra payment for the disabled man and would not affect the Maintenance Allowance payable by the Local War Pensions Committee.During the Avhole time that a disabled man is undergoing train-ing his pension is temporarily Avithdrawn and be receives the full Maintenance AlloAAance (see p. 9) from the Local War Pensions Committee in substitution for bis pension. As soon as his train-ing is finished the Maintenance Allowance will be withdrawn, and the man will receiVe his pension again.TECHNICAL SCHOOLS.Courses of training for Boot Making and Repairing have already been established at the CordAvainers&apos; College, 42, Betbnal Green Road, London E., at the Merchant Venturers5 College, Bristol, at the Norwich Technical Institute, at the Cowen Training-School, NeAvcastle, at the Leicester Municipal Technical School, and at tbe Liverpool Technical Institute. These courses have been approved by the Ministry of Pensions.It is suggested by the Trade AdArisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) that further training centres be established in the following, among other, toAvns as the demand arises:   Cardiff, GlasgoAA-, Huddersfield, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Stafford and Wellingborough.
Syllabus.The Trade Advisory Coniniittee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) for tbe Hand-Sewn Boot and Shoe Making, Boot and Shoe Repairing and Clog Making&quot; and Repairing Trades has pre-pared a syllabus (Appendices A and B) specifying the kind of instruction desirable for the training of disabled men whether in technical schools or in workshops. The syllabus is intended to be a guide to Local War Pensions Com-mittees, Local Technical Advisory Committees, and other bodies who may be interested in the training of disabled men, as to the line on which training should be given.The Minister of Labour is setting up Advisory Wages Boards in the principal towns to advise as to the question of the wages that should be paid to individual disabled men, taking into con-sideration the nature of their disability. Any workman or em-ployer in the district can obtain the advice of the Advisory Wages Board as to the rate of wages which an individual disabled man should be paid for performing certain specified work.The Boards are instructed to have regard to the current rate of wag*es for similar work in the district and to the capacity for such work of the man whose case they are considering. They are not to have regard to any pension to which the man may at the time be entitled.The question of tbe wages to be paid to disabled men who have received training through a Local War Pensions Committee will raise problems of a special nature on which tbe Local Technical Advisory Committees will have expert knowledge (see page 7, Section 6 (c) and (d)), and it has, therefore, been decided by the Minister of Labour that the Advisory Wages Boards shall only deal with tbe case of a disabled man who has been trained or is being- trained by a Local War Pensions Committee upon a specific request by the Local War Pensions Committee concerned or with the expressed concurrence of that Committee.A disabled man, if eligible to be given training by his Local War Pensions Committee, may receive during the course of training an allowance of 27s. Qd. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer), with additional allowances for children at the rate of 5s. for the first, 4s. 2d. for the second, 3s. Ad. for the third, and 2s. Qd. for each subsequent child, and if this training necessitates his living away from home and he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d. (more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) is given for his wife, together with cbildren&apos;s allowances at the rate mentioned above. In addition to this, any fees in respect of training will be paid by the Minister and, at the end of it, an amount equal to 5s. for each week the training lasted, will be paid by the Ministry to the man as a bonus for satisfactory attendance.ADVISORY WAGES BOARDS.MAINTENANCE DURING TRAINING.
APPLICATIONS FOR DISABLED MEN. ,^Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wishing to be trained or from employers wishing to train such disabled men should be addressed to the Local War Pensions Committee.CLOG MAKING.It is proposed to deal with the Clog&quot; Making Trade in a separate report.ENQUIRIES.Any questions upon, which a Local War Pensions Committee may be in doubt should be referred by them to the Ministry of Pensions, Westminster House, Millbank, S.W.1. . Any suggestions or enquiries, other than those from a Local War Pensions Committee, arising out of the technical matters dealt with in this report should be addressed to the Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers), Employment Department, Ministry of Labour, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, West-minster, S.W.1.

Printing and Kindred Trades.       Oct. 5th   9th.The main lines of the suggested training for Printing and Lithography have been laid down provisionally by the Sub-Committee with regard to hand-compositing and the linotype and monotype machines.     There was a general agreement that disabled men not hitherto employed in the trado shotild have a thorough grounding in hand-compositing before commencing training for operating the linotype or monotype machines.Both Employers and Trade Unionists were agreed that disabled mwn not hitherto employed in the trade could only be admitted into the above branches if the following conditions were satisfied :-1. That the first year of training should be spent in a well equipped technical school.2, That hhe total period of training should be four years. This would be divided as follows. :. - .. ^First and second year5e training with Government maintenance^ i,.e. one year in technical schoo] anc one year in the workshop.

APPBNDIS XIV. TRAINING.oport on schemes of training submitted during tho Weekending 10th October, 1917.CJThe Joint Committee for Lcinster and Connaught have submitted a scheme for training disabled men in the care and management of horses,-     Tho scheme will be sanctioned subject to satisfactory information on certain points of detail, such cs the number of hours training, the selection of suitable men, and the steps to be taken to ensure that the training shall be adequate,2, The scheme previously submitted by the Berkshire LocalCommittee for a course in horticulture at Windsor Castle Gardens, and was sanctioned in July last/ has now been amended so as tc admit of suitable cases being trained for a period *f 12 months in lieu of the six months originally approved,3, The Manchester Local Committee have submitted proposalsfcr training disabled men in Cinema Operating and in Commercial Clerical work.     In view of the difficulty ox arriving beferehand at a satisfactory estimate 6f fees to be paid, it has been arranged that the out-of-pocket expenses for the first six months shall be met by the Local Committee, subject to the following conditions:-(a) No special class to be started for less than five men, and every endeavour&apos; to be made to bring the number up to 10.(b) The expenses chargeable against the Ministry to Include only those specially incurred for the purpose of the classes, e,g, extra teachers&apos; salaries and cost of raw material,(c) Any proposal for purchase of special equipment or machinery to be submitted for previous approval.The period of training in classes for Sub-Station attendants in the same area, has been expended from one month to 13 weeks,4, The Dumfries Local Committee have submitted a scheme fortraining in general Farm work at a farm conneoted with the Crichton Royal Institution the men to be billeted in the town of Dumfries or in buildings adjacent to the Institute,     The scheme has been sanctioned provided that the duration of the course does not exceed one year and that a proper selection of men can be secured.     The assistance of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland is being iavited on the latter point,5. The London Local Committee have submitted a scheme fortraining of disabled men as operators in the Cinematograph Trade:, in which it is proposed that practical training should bo provided curing part of the day at the theatre and workshop of the Cinematograph Training and Employment Bureau, 167, V/ardour Street, ana during the remainder of the day theoretical training should be Given at the Polytechnic, Regent Street,     The course will last&apos;i for
552o u A/for a period of three months at a fee of 7/6 per week per man. It is proposed, that the men should be selected by:4.hx^Trades Panel -appointed by the iKm&amp;cyi Lo^al Committee XtK^-appOa^^anrt^ to Local Sub-Committees.     The Panel will ;gupjr%-isV &quot;the course of training and will find employment for the man at the termination of the course.     The scheme has laaen sanctioned.     The London Local Ccmmittee have also submitted a scheme for training in the Jtc-o-aiX. Bespoke Tailoring Trade, the training to be given at an existing class at the Polytechnic, Regent Street, a further class to be started, if necessary, at some other Technical Institute,     -It is proposed that the period of training should be 12 months and that the fees should net exceed 7/6 per week per man.     The method *f selection will be similar  o that for the Cinematograph Trade. The scheme has been sanctioned,6, The Local Committee for Great Yarmouth have proposed thatdisabled men should be trained in the manufacture of swill, crane and fruit baskets in the workshops of Messrs, A. Bateman and Son, As it appeared from a report received from the representative af the Ivlinlstry In the area that it was hoped, in effect, to create a new industry which would be dependent on a tariff, it was not considered desirable to give general sanction to the proposal. The Committee have been informed that if they can make satisfactory arrangements for individual men to be trained in one of the existing small workshops these should be specially submitted for the consideration of the Minister,

Picot, Officer i/c British Interned in Switzerland, has been asked to detail 20 men to commence at once9 Electrica1 wo rkBA skilled operative Electrician who has had experience also in Teaching, also arrives in Lucerne this week and will as soon as possible start with 20 men, to be increased to 30 as soon as the workshop equipment is ready.     Several gifts of valuable apparatus have already been promised by well known firms towards equipping this class. ..-otor : ecbanisjvuAdditional premises have been secured at Vevey so that 45 men can be put through the Course of Training at one time and we are hoping that Lieutenant Wallis who has just been repatriated and has permanent injury may be permitted to return-to Vervey to continue the work he has done with such success during his internment.     In connection with the :.,otor Mechanics School we desire to express our appreciation .of the kind offerOf
of the proprietors of        Auto Car who have undertaken to cover the cost of conducting this School.     i-e estimate the cost to be at least  600 per annum.     A cheque for  200 for the first quarter1s cost has already been received. Watch and Clock Repairing.Arrangements are in progress for starting a special Instruction Course In Watch and Clock Repairing.     There is at the present time, and. was before the war a great dearth of repairers and the hatch and Clockmakers Employers1 Federation have guaranteed, places for 100 men vvhen brainede C em oer c i a 1 C our s e s.A Commercial Training Class has been commenced, and 17 men have been detailed for this course. Art Training.A very able Scotch Artist was discovered amongst the Internees and it is proposed to held a special Art Training Course for any of the men who previous to joining up were Art Students.The main feature in all our arrangements has been as far as possible to provide training In such Trades where employment r/ould be assured on return of the men to England, and such assurance has been obtained in practically all the Courses so far organised.The Sy/iss Military Authorities together with Colonel Picot agreed to our proposals(l) That Vevey, Murengen and Seeburg should be regarded asIndustrial Centres and only the workers sent there, thus, pre^eni^ing. any distraction from their work by the presence of a number of non workers.
(2) That a regulation should be made requiring e,v.ery FITnan tc do 30 hours work per week of some kind to prevent him Regenerating into an idle and purposeless life.We hope at an early date to commence Courses of Training in Acetylene Welding for which there is a wide field of employment.     Also In Boot Repairing and Aakiiag, the Royal Army Clothing Department having offered similar facilities as those viven for Tailoring.Aajor Charley who during the period of his internment took considerable interest in Training has consented to return to Switzerland and will join the staff of Colonel Picot, Tfho has agreed to arrange for him to superintend the work at the various Centres, Viz. Vevey, -Airengen and Seeburg. Holland.Lord Sandwich is at the present tine in Holland making a survey of possibilities of similar work there, and so soon as the proposed exchange of Prisoners  has  been made we shall endeavour to make similar satisfactory arrangements for the Internees in that C0-uirtry.Believe nu /,Yours obediently, (Signed) ROBERS I.03CHELL.llajor.

Minutes of Meeting held at 5 Old Palace Yard, on Tuesday, 2nd October 1917.PRESENT.C*J.Mathew, Esq., (in the Chair)Coles Child, Esq.,B.B.Cubitt, Esq.,Miss Kelly,Corporal Linard,Mrs.McKenna,Mrs *Shakespear,Sir Frederick Stopford,Ben Turner Esq.,The Chait was takon by the Chairman.The Minutes of the meeting hold on September 18th, which had been circulated to members, were confirmed and signed by the Chairman.With reference to the proposed alterations in Parts I and II of the Regulations, it was agreed %o adopt the recommendations of the Seotion dealing with Regulations in regard to Regulation II(i) substituting 13/9 for 10/- and to accept the suggestion of the Pensions Ministry.-Provision for the training of officers1 widows as this is not provided for in the Royal warrant.(This proposal had already been agreed to by the Special Grants Committee at their meeting on 18th September.)With reference to Part II Regulations, it was agreed to submit the following amendments to the Pensions Minister for consideration and the Treasury for approval:-Regulation 7(l)(h) as submitted by the Statutory Committee to the Treasury but omitting paragraphs (b) and (c), the Regulation-1-Mili   1    ISPECIAL   GRANTS   COMMITTEE.
reading as follows:-Where there are children over 14 years of age of a sailor or soldier who are not in receipt of increased Separation Allowance under the revised scale adopted in January 1917, a supplementary Separation Allowance may be granted of an amount not exceeding the additional Separation Allowance which would have beon issuable if suoh children had been eligible therefor, provided that -(a)   The children are suffering from mental orphysical infirmity, or are whole time pupils or students at an elementary or other school or university, or are apprentices receiving not more than a nominal wage.Begulation 8(c).   It was agreed to resubmit this Regulation asoriginally drafted by the Statutory Committee omitting thelast four lines.   The Regulation to read as followsThe Special Grants Committee may, on the recommenda-tion of a Local Committee, grant a Special Separation Allowance not exceeding 5/- a week to the child of a sailor or soldier in a case where the mother was not married to or supported by the sailor or soldier, provided there is satis-factory proof that he was its father.Regulation 13(a).   It was agreed that after the word &quot;applied&quot;in the first part of the second paragraph of this Regulationto omit the words &quot;to a childless widow&quot; down to &quot;a week&quot; andto insert the following:-during the continuance of the war to a widow or child provided that the grant be limited to five shillings a week exoept with the sanction of the Special Grants Committee.The amended Regulation will accordingly read as follows:-(a)   In the case of the serious illness of a wife, child or dependant of a sailor or soldier where financial assistance is not available from an insurance or benefit society or other source, and pecuniary need exists, a grant of not exceeding 5/- a week, but such grant shall not be oontinued for a longer period than four weeks except upon a medioal certificate and in no case for more than thirteen weeks.   Provided always that the Special Grants Committee may, on the recommendation of a Local Committee, increase the said sum of 5/- to a sum not exceeding 10/- and may extend the period for which such allowance is granted in any case where, owing to special circumstances, such Increase or extension is necessary.   A grant under this Regulation shall not be paid for a longer period than 26 weeks.
The provisions of this Regulation may be applied during the continuance of the war to a widow or ohild provided that the grant be limited to 5/- a week; except with the sanction of the Special Grants Committee; and to a discharged disabled sailor or soldier pending the settlement of his claim to State pension, or of any application for a supplementary pension or special (temporary) allowance under Part I of the Regulations&apos;.Regulation 13(h).    It was agreed to submit the following:-A grant in maternity cases not exceeding 10/-a week up to an aggregate amount of  2, provided -(l)   That where the mother is entitled to maternity benefit in respeot of the insurance both of herself and her husband, or where similar assistance is received from any other society or fund, no grant shall be made; and(2)   That the Looal Committee are satisfiedthat the inoome of the family is suoh that the health of the mother and child will be adversely affected unless such grant is made, and that the Local Committee shall take steps to ensure that the grant is utilised for the purpose for whioh It is intended.This Regulation with slight amendments was submitted to the Treasury on 22nd June 1917.   The principal alterations being the increase of 5/- to 10/- a week and the aggregate of  2 substituted for a period not exceeding eight weeks.Regulations 8, 9 and 10.    It was agreed with reference to theseRegulations to suggest that both Special Allowances andSupplementary Allowances should be continued for a periodof 26 weeks for the following reasonsContinuance of Special Separation Allowance after the death of the man in respect of whom they have been paid.Under Part II Regulations a Supplementary Separation Allowance ::nay be oontinued for the period during which State Separation Allowance is paid but Special Separation Allowances are payable for 13 weeks or until the Statutory Committee have given their decision under Part I of the Regulations.The situation has changed since these provisions were mads and in lieu of allowances under Part I of the Regulations there will be in the case of 9(a),  (b) and (c)
possible olairas for State Pension under the Warrant*The suggestion that payment of Special Separation illowanoes should continue for 26 weeks is made because it is probable that in many instances cases which hare been admitted for suoh allowances would not be granted nension3, suoh as those under 9(h) where srants have been made for speoifio reasons other than need or where owing to the high standard of living of the household the test of need imposed for, the purpose of pensions may not be met-   Further, it is doubtful whether cases under Regulation 10(a) or 10(b) would be admitted either for pensions or allowances from the Special Grants Committee as it may be considered that after the death of the man the State cannot undertake tc do more than provide for his children and that the guardian who was not a dependant has no claim.There may be machinery difficulties as to which the widows and dependants branoh should be consulted but it would in any event appear to be reasonable to continue allowances for the full 26 weeks where no pension is payable so as tfi give time for any necessary adjustments to be made in the household arrangements.Regulations ll(o) and 13(g).   It was agreed to suggest to the Pensions Ministry that arrangements be made for dealing with oasea ooming under these Regulations b7 the Health Section of the Ministry and that these Regulations be removed from the new Part II when published.The following omnibus Regulation as submitted by the Section dealing with Regulations was considered and agreed to;-In any case not coming within the fore oing Regulations, where it appears to a Local Committee that owing to the Bpecial circumstances of the case, a special or supplementary allowance should be given, the Local Committee may refer such case to the   Special Grants Committee for con-sideration, and tho Special Grants Committee may, by resolution, grant a special or supplementary allowance in such oase as they may think fit.Provided always that such allowance shall not exceed the general limits in the foregoing Regulations nor the amount Which with Separation Allowance and Allotment, if any, shall equal the sum which the soldier or sailor might reasonably be expected to contribute if he were in civil life.It was pointed out that the Statutory Committee were seriously hampered in their administration of Part II Regulations by the fact that however good a case might be for support from
State Funds, no allowance was possible unless the Regulations provided for the case.   A number of cases have consequently from time to time been refused on purely technical grounds and this proved a souroe of constant irritation and complaint by Local Committees.   Refusals on technical grounds are not good policy from the point of view of the Treasury as Local Committees show a distinct tendency to disregard Regulations if those Regulations are found to exclude good cases.   Once a Local Committee finds that its recommendations are refused on the ground only that there is no provision for the cases in question, there is a disinclination to ask for authority and an increasing tendency to exorcise discretion irrespective of the limitations contained in the powers delegated   to them.There is the further point that the framing ofRegulations to meet isolated cases involves gre^t delay andan amount of labour which is quite out of proportion to the expenditure involved.5.    Jn view of the recommendations of the Section dealing withSupplementary Allowances, it was decided that the Special Grants Committee will sanction the continuance of the practice of awarding supplements as from the date of application.6.    With regard to Regulations 7(1)fa) and 7(l)(b) providing forallowances to be given in respect of contractual obligations other than rent, it was agreed that for the purpose of these Regulations rent should also include insurances, hire purchase payments, and mortgage interest and that the maximum allowance in county oases should be raised to 16/- a week instead of 8/-,   provided that a sufficient disproportion of income exists. It was decided to draft the necessary Regulation accordingly.The object of this proposal is to enable Local Committees to relieve the Civil Liabilities Committee of oases which are more conveniently dealt with by a Local Committee rether than a Central Committee such as the Civil.Liabilities Committee.The following Reports were received from the various Sections:--

APPENDIX   XIX. ORGANIZATION   BRANCHExtracts from Reports of Inspectors for Week ended 10th October 1917iNOTTINGHAM COUNTY BOROUGH LOCAL COMCETTL5.The organization of this Office is excellent\ Registration and Record keeping is of a very high order.    Lvery application is most thoroughly sifted and all statements verified before any grants are made.   There is also a most efficient system of keeping of accounts.   The expenditure is low and would have been lo^er but for the fact that the staple industries of Nottingham have been prraoti-cally ruined by the war.    There is a paid staff of 14- men and women, entailing an expenditure of  1,400 a year. So far this exmeiiii!i euro has been defrayed by the City Council.   The excellence of this Office is due to the Honorary Secretary, who is responsible for the original organization and who now devotes a lot of time to its supervision, in addition to advising the Committees concerning nearly every applicant;WILTSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.This has been a very difficult Local Committee to inspect owing to the Central Office not knowing the actual working of the scattered Sub-Committees.   A great deal of time and trouble has been spent in evolving a rather complicated system of registration of cases in the Central Office.    The Secretary was requested to get into better touch with his Sub-CommitteeS.   Our Inspector visited a great many of the Sub-Committees himself, and found that the Secretaries in the majority of oases had never met the officials of the Local Committee.    In many cases the officials of the Sub-Committses did not appear to understand the Regulations,   All cases of each SubtCommittee visited were gone into and the Regulations fully explained, as also the cases of the Local Committee, where the Sub-Committees had felt difficulties in coming to a decision.    The work of this Local Committee will require careful watching for some time.Several questions Lhave been referred to the Ministry and dealt with.    Some of the officials of the Sub-Committees have asked if they could be furnished with some sort of war badge and the Inspector was asked to bring this matter before the Ministry.Salisbury Sub-Committee.The work of this Committee is generally speaking well done. Mistakes have occurred in some of the Regulations but these were trivial and the mistakes were not wilfully made.    In seme cases papers do not contain sufficient particulars but this will now be remedied.Salisbury Plain Sub-Committee.The work of this very scattered and somewhat difficult district is well done, but grants have been made under Regulation 7(2) without reference to the Special Grants Committee.     Some-1-
unauthorised retrospective payments have been matfe, but such mistakes as have occurred have not been from wilful disregard of the Regulations but rather from a misunderstanding of them. -The Secretary of the Sub-Committee had not received an adequate supply of Circulars, and demand was also made for the War Pensions Gazette.Devizes Sub-Committee..The work of this Suo-Committee is bad.   The Regulations in many cases have not been, followed and apparently are not understood.   Many grants have been made to persons who were not dependants.   Case papers were badly kept and insufficient particu-lars entered.   The Inspector was obliged to disallow many cases and requested the County Secretary to attend the next meeting of the Sub-Committee and to go thoroughly into its working.   This Sub-Committee will again be visited shortly.Trowbridge Sub-Committee.This Sub-Committee&apos;s work has not been well done and there has been a lack of goodwill between the Sub-Committee and its officials and the County Committee and its officials. Many of the Regulations have been broken.    The Committee appear to dislike the control of the County Committee and wish to act on their own judgment, without regard to the   Regulations, in a haphazard spirit of generosity.   Several cases were disallowed by the Inspector and this Committee will again be inspected very shortly.Swindon Borough District Committee.On the whole this Committee does its work fairly well apart from some mistakes as to the reading of the RegulationChippenham Sub-Committee.The work of this Committee is well done. There are 32 cases on the booksLUTON LOCAL COMMITTEE. . .:This Local Committee was visited on 26th September, The work is excellently organised and well carried out. Cases of. treatment and training are well cared for.BAT LEY LOCAL COMMITTEE.A few cases of infringements of the Regulations are being dealt with and will not recur.   The administration is otherwise excellent.
/:W&amp;LISOaHlHE LOCAL COffiilTTBr..There is nothing to report in connection with this Committee further than that the Treasurer has had some diffi culty in getting- out his1 financial statement from the late Treasurer of the Falkirk District Committee.galkirk District Committee.This Committee has been well looked after, the Clerk, who is also Treasurer, being a capable man.Larbert District Committee.The payments are small and the work of the Sub- Committee is satisfactory.LUBCaN LOCaL COMMITTBT.There has been no administrative expenditure with the exception of a few shillings for postage.   The accounts have been made up and audited for the first two Quarters of the year.Expenditure for Quarter ending 31st March -  39 &quot; * &quot;     30th June   -  38&quot; &quot; &quot;     30th Sept. *  34The Secretary keeps a register of all oases.ARI.lii.G-H LOCAL COMMITTED..The administrative expenses of this Committee are &apos; very low ;   up to the 3pth June no salaries were paid and there was no rent for the Offices.   Provision has, however, now been made for these items and the Secretary&apos;8 salary is fixed at  110 with  25 for an Assistant.   These salaries will require the sanction of the Ministry of Pensions.ANTRIM LOCAL COMMITTEE.The following have been fixed as the salaries of thoStaff:-Secretary -  170 a year Clerk        -     50    &quot; Typist      -     20     &quot;dating from the 1st January 1917.   There is nb rent to be paid for the Offices which are in the   County Council Chambers.   The expenditure of this Committee to the 30th June amounted to  100.17, 3 whilst the administrative expenses amounted to  144, 7. 6.
