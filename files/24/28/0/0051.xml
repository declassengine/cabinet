PvyTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3RITANNIC MAJESTY - S GOVERNMENT,.L o 5jB ECS S T, G.T.-2251WAR     CABINETFACILITIES   POR   ALLOTMENTS   IN   IRELAND *Memorandum of the Chief Secretary for Ireland.1, The impetus which has been given by war conditions forthe extension of tillage in Ireland; and the enthusiasm with which the populations of large and small towns throughout the country have taken up tillage operations, have created a demand for additional legislative facilities for the creation and regulation of allotments in Ireland which I think could be met by a simple Act of Parliament with little, if any, cost to tho Exchequer; with some procpect of satis-fying public opinion among important sections of the Irish people and with a reasonable certainty of permanent practical advantage to the country.2, The poverty of the working population in most of thetowns in the Southern provinces makes it exceptionally advisable to take any legislative means which can be taken to better their position.     In the case of Dublin and of some lesser towns the horrible conditions which exist with regard to housing increase the urgency of this need.   Prom Dublin and from most of these other towns there is now a very striking demand that the steps of temporary character which have been taken during the past year for encouraging spade cultivation by town dwellers should be converted into a permanent part of&apos; the local administration of the country.3. Allotments in hundreds wore taken up on all hands underthe schemes which the Government sanctioned at the end of last December.   They have been culr-ivated with extra-ordinary success, which has been the result cf a remarkable display of industry and cleterminetionc   The continuation of the same kind cf action will, unc.ov.btec.ly; produce many benefits.   At present, however^ the system, is cf a purely temporary and indeed precarious kind.,    I am pressed by social reformers, local administrators,, rer zesontatives of , work people, and by seme Members of Parliament., to take I means for giving permanency to the allotment system which r has been established and, if I have the sanction cf the War Cabinet,. I would be ready to introduce into the House of Commons at an early date a Bill which would secure this object, and of which I will proceed to indicate the leading proposals.The defects of the present provision for allotmentsare:-(aj   Want of system(b^ Lack of definite and uniform means of securing land to be let for allot-ments.
i- 2 -(c) Lack of a simple set of powers for thelocal authorities Who ought to &quot;be - in charge, subject to control of theLo^sl Government Board,- of the. . management cf an allotment system,,(d) lack of certainty in respect of tenureof the plots.(c)   Lack of any provision for continuance after the end cf the war cf the plots which have been brought, into existence as a : war measure *(f)   The partial and imperfect application of the existing scheme - by reason of the derivation of powers from various .v quarters and the very uncertain methods&apos;.    .   .  . . by which the various classes of; i/.        : authorities can at present be set in action...: One of the. most pressing difficulties cf food supply in the coming winter will be that relating to the supply1 of milk, I think it.would be advisable to include in any Bill which might be drafted some- limited power to some local authority to acquire and utilise cow pastures.    -There are at present in two of the Irish. Land Acts powers of a limited kind which evidence&quot;a recognition of the desirability of cow pastures in some rural, districts,. but the powers which have,been taken, are not, only entirely inadequate but are practically inoperative for ..various administrative and other reasons. .- I would take as&quot;;the model.for a Bill to deal with this allotment question the-Allotments -(Scotland) Act of 1892c This Act.. is an empowering .-Aet; to local authorities.    It comprises,&apos; no doubt, powers which could only be applied in modified form to Ireland, but, it does set.up-machinery not necessarily expensive in its operation, with the object of enabling local authorities where there is urgent need for allotments- to take means by voluntary arrangement for the hiring of land to meet, the need or, with the sanction of the Executive, to exercise compulsory powers0    It also deals with the question of cow pasture.    Tc set to work upon this model would remove a reproach which&quot;is now levelled against xis of withholding from Ireland a measure cf social amelioration which is widely demanded and for which there is a sound, British precedent.    It would-, also put the existing allotment hoiders beyond danger cf losing the fruits cf their enterprise&apos; and industry, in the welter of change which may naturally follow the conclusion of the war.I believe it would: be of great benefit to Ireland to provide the legislative powers to which I have referred,(Signed)     EL 2, DUKB.&amp;IU CASTL3.09th October, 19170
