(?he result of the Ordor in Council pub-11 shet! this week is to prohibit all exports from the Unitedkingdom to Scandinavia and Holland except printed ssatter andpersonal effects accompanied by the owner.     It is not theintention of the British Authorities to refuse all appllea-tions for goods hitherto freely exported from the UnitedKingdom, but British exporters have been warned that suchiapplications are liable to bo refnsea.      Special arrangements 1Hwill be ra-ide in regard to commodities which are sent to Scan-dinavia and Holland in exchange for goods returnee to the Allies or for commodities which would otherwise be obtained by the importing countries from Germany.[I ISS.       l&apos;he Unites States Exports Boarc have concluded thattheir negotiations with the Norwegian and Swedish delegates at Washington cannot be usefully prolonged.     They are prepare^ to inform tho Korweglan delegates that unless Norway can under-I tales to prohibit further exports to Germany, the present dis-eussions can hardly have a satisfactory issue.     The Board arc prepared to make a similar announcement to Sweden, as they have quite failed to bring the Swedes to terms regarding the exports of Swedish iron ore to Germany.     The Board, however, are still nervous of taking any decisive stop which sight h^ve to be re-traetcd at a later stage, and they desire to b- assured that the Allies are prepared to face all the consequences of a re-tailstory policy on the part of the Scandinavian countries before they finally consmit themselves.     In deference to the Board we have decided to delay our proposed general donuncia-tion of the agreements with the &quot;&quot;orwegian Associations, wo are,
however, denouncing the Agreements relating to cereals, food stuff is and fodder, as these agreements require three months notice for their determination,     We are asking the Associations concerned to mintain their organisetions so that they may be able if necessary to resume their duties,She Dutch, Mission at Washington have proposed that the Dutch ships and cargoes in United States ports should he divided between Holland me. the Belgian Relief Commie sioxt. rhe United States Board foel that any such division shoulc form p;rt of a general settlement respecting the conditions on whioh Holland should continue to receive foodstuffs sno fodder ane they are for the moment postponing action.we have intimated to the United States authorities that we are prepared to help them to the best of our ability in controlling neutral voyages to the Plate by means of bunker restrictions.    But attempts to control shipments from the Argentine by means of n dual bunker supervision oan hardly prove very satisfactory in practice, and, in dealing with ships sailing under our Agreements with Norway and Denmark, our position will diplomatically be weak.     It would undoubted-iy be more effective for the Allies to establish a direct control over Argentine produce by purchasing the Argentine surplus.     She United States Board have now discussed the pur-chase of the argentine surplus with our Embassy.   She Board approve the soherce in principle and Mr. MacCormick, who thinks that an offer should be made to the Argent ins Government at an early date, has undertaken to consult the United States treasury on the financial aspect of the scheme,She Russian Government desire fee be further informed as to the grounds of our policy in regard to Scandinavia, 1ftey are anxious concerning Russian transit and the possibility
V *70of a Swedish attack upon Russia through Finland.     !2hey also attach importance to their own exchange arrangements with Sweden.       2he Hussians have hitherto held themselves free to license considerable quantities of important rationed commodities to Scandinavia in return for Scandinavian procues. Mr. $erdaan, the head of the Economic Section of the Russian Foreign Office, who has been discussing these matters with our Minister at Stockholm, is coming to London in order to arrive at m understanding.SdFilISM fho traffic between Sweden and Holland was considerablyreduced during July by British naval activities.    fhe Swedish lines engaged in this trade temporarily suspended their sailings,&quot;here has recently been a serious fall in the sterling exchange upon Stockholm.     She present rate is 13*20 kroner, which represents a fell of E7yl.     Our Minister at Stockholm is informed that this depreciation is due to large sales of sterling held in Lond.cn by Scandinavian shipowners.     2he shipowners have for t% long time allowed, their freight dues in sterling to accumulate, hut they now find it necessary to dispose of them.    !?hero unfortunately seems to be no immefi-iate prospect of checking the movement.I ?K3HXd-X&apos;DS.    &apos;Phs  uteh are inking arrangements to fetch the 100,000 tons of coal which we have placed at their disposal in British ports.      They are trying to obtain from the German Government a guarantee that the ships transporting this coal will not be molested;   but the Gexraans, who are plainly anxious that our offer should not spoil their own negotiations with the Dutch, have refused any such assurance.   She offer of British coal has considerably strengthened our position
vis-a-vis Holland, ana there will undoubtedly be great-indignation among the Dutch if the Qetm&amp;m attempt to sink or capture the vessels*^he United Ste fees Exports Board have drawn up draft pro-posals for an American-Swiss Agreement, as the result of&quot; conversations with the Swiss Minister at Y/ashington.     The proposed Agreement is drastic in character and the Swiss Minister has protested against some of the conditions.   Tho rations for commodities obtained from the United States are fixed considerably lower than the rations allowed under the S.S.S. Agreement and it is stipulated that supplies obtained from other sources shall be charged against the rations allowed from the United States.     Tho general condition is laid down that there shall be no re-export from Switzerland to the enemy or to the Northern neutrals of any imported goods either in the raw state or as part or ingredient of any article or commodity!   also that in no case shall imports be used to release home supplies for the prohibited coun-tries.   Special conditions are attached to imports of leather, cotton, foodstuffs, fodder, mineral oil and machinery.   In particular no imported oil, machine, machine parts or forg-iags may be used in any factory working for export to enemy or Horthcm neutral destinations.The proposals have not. yot been considered in detail by the British or the French Governments.* SHI^glljff Various new proposals have been made for tho purchaseof eafcmy shipping.     Tm State Department at Washington are disposed to encourage the scheme of an American Syndicate for the purchase of  00,000 tons of Austrian Shipping in Spanish waters, end the United States Shipping Board are
considering the purchase of the German ships in South America. u?hc United States Authorities consider that the demand for ton-nage overrides the objection of financial benefit to the enemy.The Chilian Government have informally proposed, that we should allow them to purchase the German ships in Chile for conveying grain from Chile to Europe.     Payment would be made out cf Chilian, funds at present in Germany.The Japanese have offered to charter to the United States Government 100,000 tons of existing shipping within the next four months and to provide further instalments of B50,000 tons each in 1916 and 1915.     They require in exchange some 450,000 tons of shipbuilding material.     The Japanese Government have now established complete control over all Japanese shipping, sad henceforth no Japanese ships may be chartered or trans-ferred or built for account of non-Japanese subjects.     fhe Japanese Minister of Communications has power to prohibit or restrict the carriage of oargo or passengers between foreign ports;   to specify routes and freights, end to requisition ships or ships under construction together with all building material and yards.       2hese measures are retrospective and licences will have to be obtained for any exemptions from their provisions.We have asked the United States Government to allow all possible facilities for the export of ship-building material to Denmark, as under the Danish Shipping Agreement all ships-built with such material will nocossarily come under the control cf the -Inter-Allied Executive,IX; % OiiJB-ilGIs        The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activities, which were reported in the period Sept.28th to Oct.4th 19X7 inclusive.
