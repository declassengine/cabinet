CABINET.COMMITTEE   OH   IRISH   REDISTRIBUTION.,VIZMeeting of Committee held on Wednesday, 26th September 1917 in the Board Room, Treasury,(Previous Paper G.T.1568)Present :-Sir Edward Carson . (in the Cheir)Sir George Cave Mr. mikeMr.Hayes Fisher Dr. AddisonMr.Adams, (Secretary)The Committee considered the following, alternative proposals,(a) to include Ireland in the Bill, without redistribution:(b) to include Ireland in the Bill and provide redistribu-tion inter se of the Irftsh seats:(c) to exclude Ireland from the Bill:(d) to exclude Ireland, but provide for the enfranchisement of Irish soldiers and sailors.It was agreed :-(1) That tho situation had been modified since the Speakers Conference by the appointment and progress of the Irish Convention, and that an attempt to deal with the franchise and with redistribu-tion in Ireland might endanger the.prospects of the Convention.(2)   That the opposition which would be offered in Parliament to the proposal to include Ireland either (a) with or (b) without redistribution might endanger the passage of the Representation of the People Bill.(3)   That if the Convention failed, to reach a settlement, the question of the franchise and of redistribution in Ireland
should be &amp;eelt with by &amp; separate Bill.(4)   That it was necessary, however, to give to Irish soldiers end sailors the same privileges as regards the exercise of the franchise as are given to British soldiers and sailors, and that provision for so doing must be made in the present Bill.The Committee therefore recommend(1)      That amendments should be introduced to exclude Ireland from the Bill save in reypeot of the pro-vision for the enfranchiseem^nt of Irish ooltliers , and sailors-     (A promise to be given that, failing a settlement by the Convention, the general question of the franchise and of redistribution will be dealt with by a separate 3111.)(2)      That if this course of action is not adopted Ireland should be included in the Bill with re-distribution of the Irish seats inter se.
