- I*S BaiTAdNIC MAJ.d^rY;S GQVERMMT. WAR   CABINET.SSCKSTG. T.2245.&quot;&quot;Question of granting an increase to S3d.11 ed worlcers on-Time rates.Mr. Churchill undertook during thr final stages of the passing of the Munitions of War Act, 1917, to rectify an anomaly which had grown up as a result of the original Act of 1915.     Under that Act unskilled and semi-skilled workers were used to a large extent in engineering produc-tion;   and by the operation of piece work rates, the earnings of these unslcilled and semi-skilled workers are found, in many caste, to be much in excess of the earnings of the skilled, engineer who supervises or prepares and sets their work. The slclllaoL-xaan&apos;s rate has advanced during the war by 15/-per week, in pursuance of the policy of the Committee on Production, whereas many ef the operatives who have been used in MdilutingH the engineering trade, are now in receipt of earnings, probably three times as much as they had been accustomed to earn in pre-war days.Mx. Churchill has powers *&amp;nder existing Acts to deal with a^ny class of workers in controlled establishments, &quot;but in dealing with the mass oaf the engineering operatives, he to some extent treads on the ground of the Committee on Pro-duction.      The CoDMittee have hitherto dealt wi-feh the whole engineering and allied trades as one.     The fifteen shillings advance has been given to the skilled supervisors in ffcestion, but it has also *been given to the mass of fitters, turners, blacksmiths, millwrights,  oundrymen and others;   and tne question now at issue, (assuming that Mr.Chiirchill13 promise is to be fulfilled), is where to draw the line bo as to tread as little as possible on the ground of the Committee on Pro-duct ion.At a conference,held on the 8th.October, at the Hotel Metropolo, three alternative   schedules were put in.    &quot;Schedule A. covered all the rank and file engineers proper -i.e$, all the engineers who would be included in the category of men admitted to membership of a Craft Union, viz., titters,turnerey-ooppersmith9,millwrights,platers, slotters, millers and many $there.     Sohedule B. went further and included foundrymen, blacksmiths, forgemen and moulders.     Both of these go much beyond the actual fulfillment of 2 r. Churchill&apos;s pledge. Schedule C. wag confined to chargehands,inspectors,viewers, and setters of machines; i.e., pYL who are directly associated with the dilutees in the production of munitions, as well as fully skilled men engaged in the production of power, either in private or public employ.     It definitely excluded any clas-&amp;ee. of workmen who oould be employed on piecework.The last named schedule was adopted by the conference as the one which could best be applied.   If endorsed by the Cabinet, there would probably be a demand,(in fact a demand ha3 already been formulated), for an increase to the whole rank and file of the operative engineers, the last award making up the   v15/-
15/- expiring this month.     &quot;Whether those  ion included in Sdhodulo C. should ho included in any increase on .t new demand i3 a matter which should be kept in mind. &apos; 2To doubt the cl-^im will be made that, inasmuch as these men arc specially useful, and tho increase gr-^nt :d them to give effect to Lr.Churchill&apos; s pledge, is merely one to rdctify an existing anomaly, they should */vai-h be included in a general advance,     On tho other huid, if cither Schedule A. or 3. were adopted, these men under Schedule C. would probably say that their position, relaiiively to the r^nic and file of tho skilled engineers, had riot boon improved, although it is improved relatively to the earnings of the dilutees.The possibility of basing the increase on pro-duction by me*ns of an overhead bonus based upon colloc-tive output, or by so^e system of payment by individual results, has boon discussed by the special Departmental Committee which has considered the matter.     The majority of the Committee have come to the conclusion that no -system of the kind is practicable;   whilst the minority consisting of the employers&apos; representatives, urged that system of payment by results should bo enforced where-over it ws practicable, as n quid pro quo for the granting of small increaBos to ? section of the men whom the majority proposed to benefit.The men covered by Schedule C. could not possibly work individual piecework.   Their w^rk i3 not of such a specialised kind as to admit of it, and many, of them are merely in charge of gangs or engaged in setting up work for dilutees, or in making tools or special devices used in repitition work.     Any, system of increased earnings based upon increased production would, therefore, have to be one of a collective characterc- i.e,some method of bonus based upon increase in total output of a workshop or factory.     This it is thought might have boon pract-cable two yoars ago; but is not practicable now, since output has already been brought up to the highest point. It is true that the data line might bo. drawn somewhat Volowtho present output of the factory or workshop ^nd a bonus given on tho product over tint line ;   but this would be merely a different method of assessment -*nd would not give, increased output.     It would be merely in-other way of. giving effect to tho recommendations of tho increase on.earnings as recommended by tho majority of the Committee and embodied in Schedule C.It will be noted that this rise has the -\opciranee of another inroad on the province of the Committee on Production, and runs acaoss tho recommendation of Lord Mil-nor&apos;s Committee whioh was given on a consideration of the miners&apos; doannd and awaits endorsement by the C--. hi not.   But in regard to that it should be remembered that the Minister of Munitions h^ 3 statutory power to control rates of wages or earning? of munition workers, in agreement with them, and that * question relating to wages falls to be dc*lt with by the Committee on Production, only on a difference arising as between tho Minister or -employer as the wago-piycr,   md the workers as the w-&quot;* go-receivers.
If, therefore, tho inorcaao now n^roed to by the iiiniatcr of Munitions 13.also agreed to by the representatives of the men oonoomod, and covered in Schedule C., then it would appenr that he i3 perfectly within hi3 rights in $oin  forward.I need hardly add th-tt a-g tho object of tho propo3od in-cre-^se is to. prevent the migration of lar^o number? of skilled men to unskilled,(but bettor paid), jobs^ 30 soon 13 the leaving certificate is&quot;abolished, (on Hohchy next j loth. October), it is moit desirable that the Cabinet should give an immediate decis-ion on tho question.G. Hi B.9th. October, 1917.
