SECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.*    Repprt/or Week ending Wednesday October 3, 1917.PART I-ACTION TAKEN. Control of Supplies and Prices. .Bacon, Hams, and Lard.- In deference to Lord Rhondda&apos;s representations, the Treasury have sanctioned the purchase in Canada of these commodities within a limit of expenditure of 3,000,000L down to the end of December, 1917, on the understanding that every endeavour will be made to reduce the purchase to the utmost possible extent.   The Government mission have commenced buying in Canada.The Lard (Returns) Order, 1917, dated September 29, 1917, requires persons holding stocks of more than ten tons of lard at the date of the Order, other than neutral lard and compound, to furnish, a return of such stocks by October 3. The Order was made for the purpose of ascertaining whether stocks were being specula-tiveiy withheld from the market. It does not apply to those who hold lard merely as storekeepers.A draft Order fixing maximum prices for bacon, hams, and lard has been prepared and is under consideration. It covers prices to be charged by importers, curers, wholesalers and retailers.Brewing and Malting.-In view of the Cabinet decision to extend the increased barrelage of 33g- per cent, permitted during the summer months to the ensuing-quarter, provision will be made to secure that only beer of an adequate gravity is designated as Government Ale, and to fix prices for Government Ale and beer of lower gravities sold in a public bar.Butter and Cheese.-K new schedule has been issued revising all butter prices as from October 2nd, 1917, and bringing British-made butter under control.The Ministry of Food has in store 4,000 tons of Australian butter costing 186s. a cwt. 25,000 boxes of Australian butter have been released to meet the present shortage, to be distributed equitably throughout Great Britain ; 7,200 tons of Argentine butter have been bought at 170-s. per cwt. f.o.b. ; 300 tons of butter have also been bought in Canada at 205s. per cwt. f.o.b. An agreement has been made Avith representatives of the Australian Commonwealth in London for the purchase of 30,000 tons, the entire Australian output for next season, at 151s. f.o.b. This trans-action must be confirmed in Australia but no difficulty is anticipated; an offer has also been made for the purchase of the New Zealand supply at the price of 155s., the difference between this and the Australian price being due to the difference in the quality of the butter.A revised schedule (No. 2) of maximum first-hand prices of British-made cheese for October and November 1917 has been issued. A scheme is being considered for the equitable distribution of butter according to the supplies available from time to time.Cereals. The Wheat (Channel Islands and Isle of Man Export) Order, 1917, dated 1st. October 1917, prohibits the consignment or shipment of any wheat from any part of the United Kingdom to any destination in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man except under licence. The order does not apply to wheat on shipboard for transport on October 1.. Dried Fruits.- Offers of currants from Spain and dates from Basra are at present under consideration.Feeding-stuff&apos;s.-Mr. II. B. Ren wick, whose services have been lent by the County of London Electricity Supply Company, Limited, and associated companies, has been appointed Director of Feeding-stuffs, with the duty of organising the supply and distribution of oil-cake and other cattle foods. ... &apos;:Three Committees have been constituted.:-(1).a Central Distributing Committee containing representatives of Importers, Crushers,. Compound Cake-makers, Distri-butors, Scottish Office, Irisli Office, and Board&apos;of Agriculture ; -(2) an Importersa   (33)4075-1   Pk 1   60   10/17   EiS A
Committee&apos;consisting of four trade representatives and two officers of the Ministry; (3) a Compound Cake Manufacturers Committee consisting of three trade repre-sentatives and two officers of the Ministry.Live Stock and Meat. A Central Live Stock and Meat Trade Advisory Committee is being set up, and the following bodies are being asked to nominate representatives : The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Scottish Office.The Department of Agriculture and,Technical Instruction for Ireland.The National Farmers&apos; Union.The Central Chamber of Agriculture.The Auctioneers&apos; Institute.The Incorporated Society of Meat Importers.The North and South American Meat Importers.The National Federation of Meat Traders&apos; Multiple Shops.The Co-operative Wholesale Society.The Federation of Journeymen Butchers.A model scale of maximum retail meat prices has been drafted for the guidance of Local Food Control Committees, and will be issued in a few days. This is intended to guide Committees in fixing maximum retail meat prices for their areas.A leaflet explaining the Meat (Maximum Ibices) Order has been prepared, and will be issued shortly for the use of the meat trade and the public generally.A Schedule of Maximum Wholesale Meat Prices for the London Area and the Home Counties was issued on September 29th for the ensuing fortnight.Oils and Fats. The ordinary business of the Department, which consists largely of the issue of licences has continued as usual. Meetings have been held by the Advisory Committee of Crushers and Refiners, and also the Advisory Committee ol Soap and Candle Making Trade. Progress is being made and information collected with a view to equitable distribution of supplies according to the relative national1 importance of the various industries concerned.Sugar.  On Saturday last a vessel carrying 4,600 tons of sugar from Cuba and the West Indies was sunk by an enemy submarine. She was making the passage singly, being a ship of slow speed, and therefore not suited for including in a convoyed fleet, and this probably accounts for her loss.The Government of Canada have acquiesced in the suggestion put forward at the instance of the Food Administrator at Washington that Canadian buyers should refrain from entry into the American market for the purchase of old crop Cuban sugar, so as to avoid competition with Mr. Hoover who is endeavouring to arrange for purchase on behalf of the Allies of the whole unsold balance (about 100,000 tons) of the old crop. They have, at the same time, expressed a desire for representation on the Sugar Committee at New York.Tea. The returns received under the Tea (Returns) Order, 1917, indicate that the total stocks of tea in the United Kingdom are : In Bond       -        -        -        - 30,894,039 lbs.Duty Paid    -----  26,709,625These figures do not include stocks in private hands or any stock below 500 lbs. or stocks held on behalf of aliens abroad. The figures of stocks In Bond are, however, much lower than those given by the Customs Authorities.The scheme for purchasing tea in India and Ceylon on Government account will&apos; shortly be submitted to the India and Colonial Offices.Holders of more than 10,000 lbs. of tea on the 3rd September who have more than four weeks stock to meet their ordinary requirements, are being directed to hold their stocks at the disposal of the Food Controller and to make a Return.The scheme for distribution of tea on Government account is being considered by a Committee of this Ministry and the wholesale trade. A Committee to consider the scheme from the point of view of the retail trade is being constituted.Local Food Control.Practically all Food Control Committees have now sent in the special return of their membership asked for by Lord Bhondda. These returns have been carefully analysed, and where the Committees contain more than four persons engaged in food trades or where no labour representative or no woman has been appointed, the case
has been or is being taken up. Public agitation about-the composition of tlie Food Control Committees seems to be subsiding rapidly.Divisional Food Commissioners are getting into close touch, witli the Food Control Committees in their Districts. They report -that these Committees generally are shovvin o-a keen desire to discharge their duties effectively. It is proposed that all ordinary correspondence between the Ministry and the Food Control Committees shall pass through the hands of Divisional Officers.A leaflet (M.G. Sugar 12) has been issued to Food Control Committees giving the rulings of the Department on a number of questions which have arisen since the initiation of the scheme, the more important being how incomplete application forms from the public shall be dealt with ; how guests,&apos; lodgers, and servants shall be treated ; and how far sugar shall be provided for certain exceptional catering arrange-ments. Lord Rhondda has decided that no allowance of sugar shall be made to public-houses for use in mixing with alcoholic drinks.Reports of the numbers of sugar retailers registered in each district are now being received by the Ministry. Applications from sugar-using manufacturers who sell their whole product wholesale have been received by the Ministry under the arrange-ment sanctioned by Lord Rhondda. They are about 400 in number, but only about 33 per cent, have complied with the condition as to an accountants certificate being attached. It has, therefore, been necessary to return the rest for completion in this respect. These returns are being dealt with and vouchers are being issued to the manufacturers by Messrs. J. B. Drake and Son.The Food Control Committees are experiencing some difficulty in dealing with lists of prices forwarded by butchers, and with butchers&apos; fortnightly accounts. The Divisional Commissioners report a number of difficulties arising through the purchase of cattle at prices which work out above the wholesale maximum price. It is, however, reported from some districts that the farmers&apos; agitation against the Meat Orders is now subsiding.A number of minor difficulties have arisen locally in connection with the Bread and Flour Scheme. In Scotland, particularly, there are demands in country districts that bakers shall be allowed to charge a higher price than Qd. for the 4-lb. loaf. Food Control Committees have been given power to fix the wholesale and &quot;retail price of milk in their areas. They have also been entrusted with the duty of registering wholesale and retail dealers in potatoes and of fixing retail prices, if necessary. The presence of Press representatives at meetings of Food Control Committees will be decided by the Committees themselves.A Press announcement has been issued with reference to the particulars which householders are required to give on application for sugar registration cards. It is pointed out that on the one hand these particulars will enable Food Control Com-mittees to check or prevent duplication or fraud, and further, that the approximate census so found of the population in each district will be of the greatest value should it become necessary to ration other kinds of foodstuffs.Enforcement of Orders.Sugar (Registration of Retailers) Order. A Mile End grocer was fined 50Z. for making an untrue statement when applying for a certificate of registration. The prosecution was instituted by the Stepney Food Control Committee.Potatoes. At AVisbech, a farmer was fined 300L on 12 counts of having sold seed potatoes at prices above the maximum. The excess profit was 211L Three other offenders at the same place were fined 1201., 801., and 501. respectively with costs in each case. At Spalding, a farmer was fined 200Z., 100Z. on each of two summonses, and costs, for selling potatoes above the maximum price. The Chairman of the Spalding Bench . expressed the hope that there Avould be no more cases of that description ; if there were, the Court would deal with them even more seriously, and probably order both fine and imprisonment.-Several cases of reported contraventions of. Orders fixing maximum prices are under investigation.The precise relation of Local Food Control Committees, Local Authorities, and Police, in relation to the enforcement of Orders has not yet been defined.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The following tables and paragraphs indicate : (1) The continuance of low imports in the case of wheat and other cereals,with the exception of oats. (2) A falling-off in the imports of bacon, ham, margarine, and tea, a featurerendered the more serious by the low figures to which the stocks ofmost of these commodities have fallen, this latter being ascertained byspecial inquiries.(3) The importance of economy in consumption as suggested in last week&apos;s report.Imports.215,000 tons of the principal foods (including rice) were imported last week, an improvement of 27,000 tons on the week before (Table A). There is little change in wheat, but an increase of 20,000 tons in oats. Beef and mutton diminished from 7,597 tons to 5,856 tons, and bacon and hams from the relatively high level of 8,170 tons the week before last, to 4,483 tons last week. The imports of margarine have fallen step by step from 2,940 tons in the week ended September 1st to 22 tons last week ; this fall is only partly compensated by an increase in imports of butter, as is shown in the following table.Imports of Butter, Margarine, and Cheese.

The imports of sugar have again risen, 55,415 tons being obtained. Only 758 tons of tea were received and the total for 39 weeks to September 29th, 1917, is 12,000 tons (35 per cent.) less than in the corresponding period last year.Consumption.Meat. The supply of home-fed meat at the Central Market, London, and the markets of Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool (Table B) again shows a considerable increase in the week ended September 22nd ; the percentage increases for three successive weeks have been 7, 14, and 15. In London, however, there is a fall of 7 per cent, in the most recent Aveek, viz., that ended September 29th.The supply of foreign meat increased in the week ended September 22nd, but fell again in London in the following week.The number of fat cattle at 51 markets fell slkhtly (4 per cent.) in the week ended September 26th (Table C) and that of sheep fell 9 per cent. There was a considerable increase of pigs.Bread and Flour. The completed figures from the Bakers&apos; and Retailers&apos; returns of sales in the four weeks ended September 15th* (Table D) confirm the preliminary returns given last Aveek and show an increase of 1 per cent, over the four weeks ended August 18th following on a fall of nearly 20 per cent, since March, A. slight increase is observed in most parts of the United Kingdom, the local variations being-attributable to movements during the holiday season ; thus consumption has increased about 3 per cent, in London, and fallen very slightly in the country districts and small seaside toAvns.Differences, hoAvever, appear when comparison is made A\rith the previous year. The completed returns indicate that in 1916 consumption, instead of rising \ per cent.* That is before the reduction in the price of bread.
as stated last week, fell very slightly per cent.) in September as compared with August. The general saving in the United Kingdom in the four weeks ended September 1917 is only 4 per cent. (Table Hj as compared with the corresponding weeks of 1916. The fall, however, in London was 8 per cent., in other large towns in England and Wales 4  per cent., in England and Wales generally 4  per cent.; the fall is in general greater in the, Northern counties than in the Southern. InScotland, on the other hand, the consumption in 1917 has in most months been maintain jd at the same level as in 1916, and in the last four weeks is 1^ per cent, higher than last year. Similarly in Ireland the consumption in the last eight weeks appears as slightly higher than 1916.Bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; stocks have diminished ; on July 21st they held about 2&apos;8 weeks&apos; consumption, ^ on August 18th 2&quot;4 weeks&apos;, and on September loth 2*0 weeks&apos;, a reduction being observed throughout the kingdom.

The reports of increased deliveries from mills since September 15th may indicate that the stocks are now being replenished.Wholesale Prices.Imported beef has fallen sharply from 105s. to 92s. Qd. per cwt. Canadian bacon has risen 3s. to 160s.   Barley has risen 3 per cent, and oats fallen 2 per cent.A   4075-1
