SECRET-.2262.FARCABINET.ASSISTANCE FOR ROUMA2TIA(Memorandum &quot;by Lord Milner;)In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet ( War Cabinet 246, Minute 10.) I interviewed to-day the Roumanian Minister, who was accompanied by his Military Attache.    The Minister pointed out that the arrangement, which was concluded some eight months ago at our suggestion, and under which all de-mands for supplies tc Romania were to be formulated by the French Military Mission at Jassy, had completely broken down,  as it had been found impossible to obtain prompt replies on points subr-.itted to the Mission for decision,   The proposal, which has just been  looted,  to establish a Commission in Petrograd whose recomrienda-tions should be carried out here by the Co-  -ission Internationale de Ravilaillement, was welcomed by him as being likely to prove a more efficient organisation for this purpose.The Allied Conference held in petrograd in January last agreed to a provisional allocation of shipping tonnage to Russia during 1917 of about 1,600,000 tons,  exclusive cf coal.   Of this 120,000 tons were earmarked for Roumania.   The approximate ohip-ments up to September 30th last have been 1,028,0C0 tons to Russia, and 63,000 tons to Roumania.   As regards the immediate future Roursania has been allotted 15,,000 B/X tons out of a total of 90,000 B/L tons to be shipped during the first two months of the Murman season (i.e... November to January) ..The most pressing needs at the moment fall under the fol-1owing heads:-1.   Pood.This is undoubtedly the gravest-problem.   An army of some 600,000 Russians are at present in Roumania, and are living
entirely en the resources of that country.   The Minister drew an exceedingly gloomy picture of the prevailing conditions arising from the pillage and destruction carried out -by the Russian troops.   In this particular matter he realised that we were powerless to help, except by exerting combined diplomatic pressure on. the Russian Government.2 0   Heavy Artillery.   .The most pressing demand under this head is for the complete equipment in this an., of 5 additional divisions.   The French Govern-cent have stated that they are unable to give any assistance.   Up to the present we have only supplied one battery (4,  6inch, Howitzers),&apos; and this by transfer from Russia.    I understand, however,  that General Cailwell is going into the whole question of the allocation of Heavy Artillery with the Chief of the Ir-.pe.rial General Staff,  and hopes that it may be possible to give Rounania 3d .e assistance. 3*   Medical and Other StorejuThe Minister undertook, under this head,  to formulate his demand through the Military Attache a.t Petrograd. 4. Finance.Credits for  18,-000,000 have so far been received from the French -Government,  and this sun has been entirely expended.   Out of the  22,000,000 credit grantee, by us,   4,000,000 has been expended, whilst  8)000.000 has had to be hold in reserve as security for p.aper issued in Rounania by the National Bank of Rounania for expenses in that country.    There remains,  therefore,  a our- of  10,000,000 unex-pended in this country,  a proportion of which, however, will be required as additional security for further paper issues.   In addition to this the Roumanian Government are in hopescf obtaining credits for 40,000,000 dollars in America,  for orders placed entirely in that country.   The whole financial situation will be settled at the forthcoming -Conference which is,  I understand,   to be held in London at the end of this . onth.   The Minister further stated that  . it would probably be necessary for his Government to apply to us in the near future for a further loan.
9 r 9tl (jThe Minister undertook to refer to me as occasion arose on any matters requiring immediate decision, and I promised to keep the War&apos;Cabinet informed of any requirements which he might &quot;bring to my notice.(initialled) M.10th October,  1917.
