A R     0 A B I IB T.PROPOSED FORMATION OF LEAGUE Off NATIONS TO SECURE THE MAINTENANCE OF FUTURE PEACE *(See also Papers P. 18 and P.19).tones &apos;Qp-oy of a letter from Viscount Bryoe to the Prime Minister.3 Buckingham Gate, S.W. ( 30th August 1917.dear Prime Minister,Herewith I have the honour to send you a letter signed by a small fiber of persons of weight, only a very few having been invited to i it..I feel sure you are in sympathy with the sentiment it expresses, j cannot but feel, speaking for myself, that a declaration by H.M. rernment that they loQk hopefully forward to the creation after the r, of some machinery for the preservation of a&quot; permanent peace by a ibination of free peace-loving nations, and that they are prepared to te practical steps in that direction,, would have an excellent effect I only here and in America, but also upon the. mind of. the RussianIople.   Such, a declaration might oven do something to lead the better ctions of the German people to understand that we are carrying on war no&apos; selfish Qr vindictive spirit, but for the sako of preventing aggres-ion and strife in the future.   I- earnestly hope it may be found possible say something in this sense.If it were previously ascertained by unofficial communications, that 3 U..S. Government would receive favourably a proposal made officially them that a small Committee consisting of competent persons from both untries should.be set. up to examine the idea and the best means of ving effect to it., an invitation publicly, addressed, to that Government d favourably responded to by them to create such a Committee would be oepted as a pledge uhat the matter would be taken out of the regime of scry, with a device to deal with it in a serious and practical way.Very truly yours,;&apos; (3d) ERYCEENCLOSURE TO ABOVE.The signatories to this document desire to represent to His jesty-s Government the desirability of taking steps to examine and if ssible reach a solution of the problem of how best to establish immed-.tely after the war, a Combination or League of Nations for protecting 18 international right and providing machinery calculated to secure an during peace,.They submit that unless an effort in this direction is now made the lied Governments may find themselves actually occupied in negotiating rms of peace beiore they have reached a preliminary understanding among emselves as to the principles to be followed and the methods to be adopt - in order to make peace permanent.Various schemes have been put.xorward In this and in other countries ich have obtained much public support and the&apos;idea which underlies them s been -commended by leading statesmen, including Lord Grey ox F?lloden, * BeIf our, Mr. Atouith, and the present 2rirne Minister.Moreover, the President oi the United States has declared that one the chief objects oi&apos; that country in entering into this war is to cure a permanent settlement oi international relationships by means of me such, schemes as those referred to.I?7
-2-view ci these considerations it is suggested that the time has Arrived when Eis Mv/jestyrs Government should arrange that a small hoc1 y fci nialiiied persons drawn from Allied countries should meet to examine this subject and^to report their conclusions as to what plan is -orae-ticatle and expedient, stating various alternatives and considerations proper to be regarded.Since it may be deemed not at present advisable to invite the jlied^countries generally to join in this ehruiry it might be possible rs a first step to obtain the co-operation of&quot;certain specially qualifie isrsono from the United States of America, from which the idea&quot; has -,r&apos;6&quot;-seeded, who would confer with tho British members and orenare a prel--m-jaary draft or drafts to be mado a basis of discussion&quot; for the ennsidera [ion of the Aliiob Governments..8th August 1917.BryceCosmo Ebor   foFrancis Cardinal BourneBeauchamp   foSelborneE&quot;w, T.
