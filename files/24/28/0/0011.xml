Naval Conference of Powers united against Germany.September 4 and 5, 1917.REPORT AND CONCLUSIONS OF CONFERENCE.&quot;&apos; he Conference was opened by Sir Eric Geddes, First Lord of the Admiralty, who offered a welcome to the representatives of the Powers united in war against Germany, and reminded them that the Conference was called at the suggestion of the Government&apos; of the United States of America.ADMIRAL MAYO, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Atlantic Fleet, explained that he came with no definite instructions, but with the desire to learn how the United States Navy might best assist and co-operate with the Allied navies, particularly in dealing with the submarine menace, which his Government regarded especially seriously at the present time. He also emphasised his conviction of the value of personal intercourse between officers of his own and the Allied navies.With these preliminaries the Conference proceeded to discuss the Agenda drawn up by the Admiralty and additional Agenda put forward by representatives of the Allies. Sir Eric Geddes took the Chair, being relieved by Sir John Jellicoe (First Sea Lord) when his presence was required at a meeting of the War Cabinet.The Agenda and Conclusions of the Conference were as follows: Item \.--The Question of a Close Offensive in German Waters.ADMIRAL JELLICOE made a statement in full of an offensive which miizht conceivably, and in certain circumstances, be taken by the Allies in German waters.After discussion on the various aspects of the matter and the steps which it would be necessary to take in order to ensure its success, the Conference agreed that the question should be carefully considered by the Allies, and that they should indicate in due course to the British Admiralty the contribution of old warships which they would be prepared to provide, the possibility of embarking on the proposed operation being dependent amongst other factors upon the supply of the number of ships indicated by Admiral Jellicoe.ADMIRAL JELLICOE suggested that the required number of ships might be supplied as follows : 	Battleships.	Cruisers.British	18	13French	5	12Italian	0	0Japanese	2	7.    US.A.        ...         ............	12	8Total ...	40	43Item 2. The Alternative of a Mine or Net Barrage either in German&apos;Waters or further afield.ADMIRAL JELLICOE put. forward, as an alternative to tho above-mentioned operation in German waters, the suggestion that the activity of the German submarines might be restricted by the laying ot an effective minefield or mine-net barrage. If such an operation were undertaken, he proposed that it should take the form of: (a.) An efficient mine barrage, so as completely to shut in the North Sea. This operation necessitated the provision of at least 100,000 mines, which would not&apos; be available for some considerable time.(b.) A barrage of mine nets. He had considered this alternative, but thought it imnracticable.
In the view of the Conference it was felt that alternative (a) could not be under taken until an adequate supply of mines of a satisfactory type was assured. Failing the adoption of alternative (a), an improvement and extension of the present system of minefields was desirable, and the Conference, agreed that a barrage of mine nets was impracticable. In this connection the British shortage of skilled personnel (especially fitters) required for the assembly of mines was noted, and the United States and Italian representatives undertook to consider how far they could assist in supplying the deficiency.Item 3. Offensive Measures against Enemy Submarines in the North Sea.The question of the best offensive measures which should, as far as possible, be taken against enemy submarines in the North Sea was discussed at length.   It was , agreed that the measures desirable were : [a.) To attack the submarine bases ;(6.) To mine the submarines in effectively ; and(c.) To attack the submarines at sea ;and it was felt that these measures should be amplified as far as possible on the lines explained in detail by Admiral Jellicoe, which received the general concurrence of the Conference.Item 4. Measures to deal with Enemy Submarine Cruisers of Large Radius of Action on the High Seas.ADMIRAL JELLICOE put forward,.for the consideration of the Conference, the following measures which might be taken to deal with- the enemy submarine cruisers with a large radius of action on the high seas : (1.) The use of decoy ships, working in concert with submarines, for offensive action ;(2.) Concerted measures for preventing the establishment of enemy submarine bases overseas ;(3.) The convoy of all craft, including neutrals in the service of the Allies, as far as possible ;(4.) The development of a wireless warning system and an intelligence centre in the Azores.(3) would require additional cruisers, and the Conference decided that the Allies should see whether they would provide cruisers or old battleships for this purpose. (2) and (4) were referred to a Committee consisting of Admiral Oliver. Admiral Hall. Admiral Salaun. Captain de Rothiacob. Captain Twining.Captain-Lieutenant de Carvalho, the Portuguese Naval Attache, was invited to join them.It was agreed that the Conference should adopt the recommendations of the Committee (whose report is printed as Appendix I), which were as follows: (i.) That the respective Admiralties and Ministries of Marine should communi-cate with their Colonial Ministers and ask for instructions to be given to their Colonies and Oversea Possessions to keep supervision over all harbours and anchorages to gain intelligence of German submarines or suspicious vessels.(ii.) That steps should be taken to ensure close co-operation between Allied Ministers in n utral countries to make such representations as will ensure adequate action to prevent submarines or suspicious vessels being succoured or allowed to make use of territorial waters, (iii.) That the question of fitting certain ships in convoys with powerful W/T to pass messages-should receive consideration whenever convoys should be established, having particular regard to the difficulty of receiving W/T intelligence from vessels attacked off the coast of South America and in the South Atlantic generally.
(iv.) That, with the permission of the Portuguese Government-* .(a.) A United States naval force should be based in the Azores ;(6.) A British Intelligence Centre should be established in the Azores; (c.) British Directional W/T Stations should be established in the Azores; (d.) A British Long Distance W/T- Station should be established in theAzores for the war.   ..(Any British units would work under the general directionsof the United States Senior Naval Officer.)Item 5. Establishment of Convoys universally for Outward and Homeward Trade, and Organ isation necessary.ADMIRAL JELLICOE made a statement on the general convoy situation, and the Conference agreed to accept it as embodying its views ; the question of additional cruisers for convoy work to be further considered by the Allies at the first opportunity.Item 6. Establishment of Convoy System in Mediterranean: Necessity for this System in order to ensure Adequate Supply of Coal to Italy and to Economise TonnageAfter this question had been discussed at some length, it was referred to a Committee composed of Rear-Admiral Duff (Chairman), Vice-Admiral de Bon, Rear-Admiral Salaun, Rear-Admiral Funakoshi, Captain Lovatelli,to consider and bring up a report at the Conference. The Conference, after discussing the report (printed as Appendix II), approved and adopted the recom-mendations of the Committee, which were as follows: (l.) That a general system of convoy in the Mediterranean is desirable.(2.) That on account of the shortness of the routes a convoy system of greaterfrequency is required in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic in order toavoid loss of tonnage. (3.) That convoy escorts should be so arranged that trade will not be undulydelayed, and that delay in port should be avoided. (4.) That the following routes (indicated in order  of importance) should beconvoyed :  Gibraltar to Genoa. Gibraltar to Bizerta. Bizerta to Port Said. Marseilles to Bizerta. Marseilles to Algiers. Malta to Suda Bay. Naples to Bizerta. Malta to Taranto. Gran to Gibraltar.These include main traffic lines only : coa,stal traffic may well continue as at present.(5.) That Suda Bay to Salonica is not a suitable route for convoy, but should be escorted and patrolled as at present(6.) That the minimum force necessary to provide reasonable protection to.a convoy of twelve ships and over is six, an escort of eight being desirable. A minimum of four escorting vessels is necessary for a convoy of tour to twelve ships ; six is desirable.(7.) That the question of the number of ships which each of the Allies might provide for convoy purposes is one for the Allied Council, now sitting at Malta to consider the Mediterranean convoy system in detail; and that generally nothing in these recommendations is intended to limit the powers of the officers of the Allied Navy now considering the convoy system at Malta.[984] C
It was also decided that the Allied Council sitting at Malta on the general question of trade protection in the Mediterranean, should be. informed that the International Naval Conference in London wished the Council to know that the Conference regarded it of the utmost importance that in their deliberations the necessity of economising tonnage by avoidance of delays should be constantly borne in mind. This matter was agreed to be of prime importance, and it was proposed to discuss it further at the next meeting after the reports of the Malta Council were received.Item 7.-The Laying of the Otranto Barrage and its Defence by Allied Destroyers : Aircraft and Submarine Patrol for the Barrage.ADMIRAL JELLICOE, having explained the present situation with regard to the laying of the Otranto barrage, and having drawn attention to the unprotected condition of the net drifters, stated that a protective force composed of six destroyers constantly on patrol duty at night was necessary. Of this Great Britain is prepared to provide the number required to maintain three on patrol, and asked that the Italian naval authorities should provide the destroyers necessary to maintain the remaining three.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI-VISCONTI promised that he would consider the point referred to by Admiral Jellicoe, and would take steps to ascertain from head-quarters whether three destroyers could be provided by the Italian Navy.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON stated that the French Ministry of Marine would have no objection to some of the French destroyers allotted to Italy being used for this work in conjunction with the Italian destroyers.Item 8. Offensive Measures in the Adriatic against Enemy Bases.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI-VISCONTI was invited to state his views as to a possible offensive against the Austrian naval forces located in the Adriatic, it being-suggested that an operation, having for its object the occupation of the Island of Curzola, might be successfully undertaken, and if this were carried through beneficial results would accrue to the Allies. It was further suggested that bombing operations by aircraft might be carried out against the Austrian submarine bases in the Adriatic.Vice-Admiral Cusani-Visconti explained the present position, and the difficulties involved in the occupation of Curzola, and stated that this proposal had been considered in the earlier stages of the war. He explained the bombing operations that had already been carried out against Austrian bases, and referred to the Anglo-Italian ojDeration of this nature Avhich had just been attempted.The question of an attack on Durazzo was also discussed.Item 9.-Assistance by Allied Fleets in the Protection of White Sea against Submarine Attack.At the request of REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF this matter was considered by the Conference. He urged the importance of the immediate provision of protective forces in the Kola inlet, as he anticipated that the Germans would keep their submarines on the White Sea route for a longer period this autumn than they did last year, because Russia has just&quot;established a new naval base in Kola Bay, open during the whole winter, and connected with Petrograd by a new railway line. He asked whether Great Britain could not supply twelve armed trawlers for the purpose.ADMIRAL JELLICOE, whilst giving expression to the desire of Great Britain to render all the assistance in her power in dealing with the position which Rear-Admiral Kedroff anticipated, statedjthat, owing to the shortage in the number of armed trawlers available, we could not hold out hope that Great Britain would be able to provide the force for which Rear-Admiral Kedroff asked.Admiral Jellicoe expressed doubt as to whether the anticipation voiced by Rear-Admiral Kedrofl as to the German submarines remaining in the White Sea for a longer period than was the case last year would be realised, but undertook to consider what could be done to meet the requirements which had been indicated by Rear-Admiral Kedroff. -
MINUTES OF PROCEEDINGS.September 4.SIR ERIC GEDDES, the First Lord of the Admiralty, stated that he would like, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to welcome the Allied representatives to the Conference today, which, as was known, was called at the suggestion of the United States Government so that advantage could be taken of the visit of Admiral Mavo and his Staff to discuss the naval situation.ADMIRAL MAYO- then said: I should like to explain first of all that I came over with no instructions at all, but came simply with the desire to acquire intormytiou to take back with me to our Government as to what has been done, what is being done, and more especially what can be done in the future, and how the United States can assist and co-operate.   In conversation with our President, and in conversation with the Secretary of this Department, it is impressed upon me very much the earnest desire of our President and of our Navy, and all of us, to do all&apos; we can in order to advance the prosecution of this war.   We regard very seriously, and regard especially seriously at this time, the submarine menace, and I think if we can get first-hand information to enable us to realise the difficulties, I might go back and communicate with the Naval Department of our Government a better appreciation of the actions, and perhaps enable them to do more than they are doing, and find means for better co-operation and better assistance.   .We realise that over here the war is being carried out with wide experience on both sides of the Channel and practically all the parts of the world, and the United States comes in at a late hour lacking that experience, and it is their desire to help and to bring about material assistance, which is all we can do.   We have no plans to suggest, but came here simply to learn.   I think that, perhaps, will give you the idea of the feeling which pervades our Government to allow me to come over. One other point is that I believed we might be of real assistance by meeting the representatives of the Allied Navies personally and getting into touch with them, and get, [984] DItem 10. Assistance to Italy by the United States of America in the direction of Supplying Material.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI-VISCONTI asked that this subject might be discussed by the Conference. He had before him a list of the material required, and emphasised the delay which his Government experienced in obtaining the delivery of important orders alreadv placed in the United States. He hoped that Admiral Mayo might help his Government to overcome these delays. He gave in detail the main requirements of the Italian Navy.ADMIRAL MAYO undertook to make representations to his Government with a view to securing an expeditious delivery of the orders referred to. As regards further material help, he professed himself unable to give any undertaking, and suggested that the correct procedure would be for the Italian Government to make representations to the United States Government through the usual channel.Arising out of the discussion upon this matter, the question of the provision of United States or British dest oyers for the Mediterranean was discussed, and ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that if the United States destroyer programme resulted in relief of British destroyers from the duties upon which they were at present engaged, further British destroyers would no doubt be sent to the Mediterarmean for anti-submarine work or trade protection.The proceedings were.closed by SIR ERIC GEDDES expressing his pleasure at meeting the members of the Conference, his appreciation of the trouble they had taken to be there, and his hope that they shared his conviction of the value of periodic personal discussion among the heads of the Fleets united in war against Germanv.
their points of view. A more personal acquaintance is undoubtedly of value, and since I have arrived I am more than ever convinced that that personal touch is invaluable.SIR ERIC GEDDES then said : I feel sure that all of us who have the pleasure of meeting Admiral Mayo to-day will appreciate very much the spirit in which he has come over, and the desire he has of hearing from us as much as is possible about the conditions of warfare here, and also that we appreciate very much the instructions which he has from the President of the United States that he should consult with us as to the further co-operation of the American Navy with us. I think the best way, probably, of carrying this Conference forward would he for each of the Powers represented here to bring up, as we proceed with our deliberations, any points which they wish to discuss, and if thej&apos; will give a note to the Secretary we could then discuss these matters at a suitable hour as we proceed with our deliberations. I do not know whether any of the representatives present have brought notes of the points they wish to discuss. If they have, and would hand them to the Secretary, we would arrange to bring them up in due course. In the meantime, we have placed on an agenda items which Sir John Jellicoe would like to discuss with you, and if that course appeals to the Conference, I would propose that after any representatives present have made any remarks on Admiral Mayo&apos;s opening speech, that we should commence with the points which Sir John Jelhcoe has noted down, and then proceed to take those which any of the representatives here wish to bring to the Conference. Perhaps, however, the represetatives of the Allied Powers here to-day would wish to say something.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI then read the following statement :-On behalf of the Italian Government I have to say that we welcome very much the taut that the United States have promoted this Conference to advise on the best methods to prosecute the war to a successful end ; that is, indeed, our common and supreme aim.Before we begin our discussions, however,and in that spirit of frankness which prevails amongst sailors, we would like very much to point out to a feature of the actual position, that is. that the United States are not at present at war with Austria, while geographical conditions independent from our will make Austria the principal and most active and imme-diate enemy against which Italy is fighting. We might say that, as Austria has completely bound up her destinies with those of Germany so as to form practically only one country, every action against Austria, tends to weaken Germany. Besides, in the Mediterranean and. in the Adriatic. German and Austrian submarines work together in their dailv attempts to shake the naval power and destroy the lines of communication of the Allies, so that at least, so far as war at sea is concerned, it -would be difficult for any country at war with Germany to make any difference between the German and the Austrian flags.We flatter ourselves that at large these ideas are probably accepted by the United States Government, but since the fact remains that our principal enemy is not at war with them, it will be better, we think, for the common purpose of this Conference if the United States Delegation could tell us how far their Government ai e willing, independently from the actual situation, to co-operate also with Italy to stiffen her effort to win this war.We speak candidly, and as we have been glad to see the American troops land in Prance and American ships reinforce the Atlantic patrols, we come here in the hope that also Italy may have practical evidence that for the United States all theatres of Avar are common battlefields, that all friends of Germany are enemies of us all.Besides the various active co-operation by armed forces, there is another field in which the United States can bring to us a welcome, a, precious and I would say a most needed contribution, that is, in giving us those supplies and materials of which we and our other Allies are short for making ships, machinery, and munitions of war.We would welcome any declaration from the American delegation to that effect, and we would then he on a firmer ground, so far as Italy is concerned, to bring this Conference to useful conclusions.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON said that am thing lie had to say would follow cn Admiral Jellicoe&apos;s statement.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF stated: I desire on behalf of the Russian Govern-ment to state that Russia will appreciate very much any co-operation which the Allied Fleets are able to give.   We realise how very important it is for us, and we should like
the utmost support that the Allies can give to Russia to relieve the pressure of the German submarines in the White Sea. -REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI said he had nothing to say.SIR ERIC GEDDES then stated as follows: After the points that have been mentioned, I take it that the Conference is ot opinion that we had better discuss the points of which Sir Jolni Jellicoe has made notes, and we can. then discuss the other matters which have been raised by Admiral Visconti and Admiral Kedroff.ADMIRAL MAYO then stated : I think that it may be that some points might be worth discussion which are not really points of discussion in a general conference, and I would like to have an informal talk with our Allies&apos; representatives. I don&apos;t know whether I can give them actual information, but can tell them how we feel. That would be satisfactory, I think.VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS, with regard to this, stated: Might I be allowed to say in that respect that these individual questions should also be taken up in conference, because a number of influences may be brought upon naval officers which will affect matters in different directions. To cite my own case, 1. came over toco-operate actively, and there lias been constant pressure brought to bear upon&apos;us by individual countries to have certain things done, and those things employ a military decision. That is -what is to be expected, but when it arises it necessitates coming together in council to decide what we shall do. I may quote an example, not in criticism, but in order to understand what has taken place and what must inevitably take place. When we first began to send forces over here there was a demand coming from Washington, through repre-sentatives of various countries, that our forces should be distributed in a certain manner. In other words, the Ambassadors were desirous of deciding as to how our forces should be distributed. As a result of that pressure a conference was called in Paris to decide what the dispositions of our forces should be when they came over. I only wish to make this point to show that if individual representatives discuss what they would like to do, it necessitates coming together as a body to decide what to do.ADMIRAL MAYO replied that he thought Admiral Sims had misunderstood him. He had no idea of suggesting that anything that affects military operations should be taken up separately.   Those things must necessarily be Conference matters.Item 1.SIR ERIC GEDDES stated that he thought the notes of what Admiral Sir John Jellicoe suggested, which had been passed round, had now been perused, and he would now ask Sir John Jellicoe to explain his views on the first item.ADMIRAL JELLICOE&apos;S statement is as follows : The first question we placed on the agenda paper was that of the possibility of certain offensive measures in German waters. It is not a question which we propose to discuss in detail, because obviously if such an offensive ever took place the less said about it before it takes place the better.The object of such an offensive would be to block in German submarines. We do not imagine that any other operation in German waters would be worth the risk involved, because obviously as the Heligoland Bight is full of mines, and could be full of submarines, it would be very unwise to risk the modern capital ships of the Allies in waters where there would he nothing to gain and everything to lose, but a situation may arise when the only way of keeping down the submarine menace would be to block the submarines in. It is a matter which has been, of course, considered many times, but we have recently had it very closely examined as to the possibilities of carrying out such blocking operations as would prevent submarines getting to sea at all. &quot; Such operations could not, of course, be confined solely to the North Sea ports of Germany. It would also have to take place in regard to Baltic ports, because as we could not block Kiel harbour we should have to block the exits from the Baltic. All these questions have been examined. The operation is one of great magnitude, and it would require the whole of the navalforces of the Allies, and although it is undesirable to go into details, I think it necessary to put before the Allies what would be involved in the way of the provision of ships. Everybody will agree that we cannot spare merchant ships for the purpose; every ship we have got we want to bring food and munitions and supplies for the Allied countries. The only alternative, therefore, left would be to use old warships.^ We have worked out an operation on those lines, and I have here a list of the ships which would be necessary to carry out that operation, and I think
before we can further consider the question of such an operation, should the time arise, we must first of all kno-v from our Allies whether they would be prepared to provide those ships. I will give the number of ships required, all of which are necessaiy if we carry out the operation.	Battleships.	Cruisers.British	18	13French	5	12Italian           ...         ...        ....	3	3Japanese	2	7United States ...	12	coPerhaps, the representatives of the Allies would later on say whether they think it would be acceptable to them, supposing this operation had to take place, or supposing we thought there was any possibility of success if it did take place, whether they would consider it advisable to provide those ships.SIR ERIC GEDDES asked if anybody had any observations.ADMIRAL MAYO stated : There is much information to be acquired, and we cannot, until that information is forthcoming, say whether or not such an operation would he successful even if we assisted.   It certainly iooks like a very big job.SIR ERIC GEDDES said that he understood Sir John Jellicoe to point out this. He wishes to-day to put before the Allies who are represented here the proposal . that in the event of such an operation appearing, after the fullest consideration, to be a possibly successful one, the Allies would he prepared to consider favourably providing the number of ships which he has put on lists. All that Sir John Jellicoe wishes is that a note should be taken of his suggestions, and upon a suitable occasion let us know whether, in the event of such operation being likely to yield successful results, each country would be prepared to contribute ships towards that end. The First Lord asked Admiral de Bon if he had anything to say.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON said it would be necessary to go into the question closely.SIR ERIC GEDDES then asked if Admiral Kedroff could help in this at all.BEAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF stated that he would like to suggest that in the case of necessity he thought the provision of the ships would be a cheap price to pay if the operation was successful.   The question might certainly arise if the losses contemplated by submarines by next spring came about, and in that event the price would be cheap.   He would like to say also that anything which Russia could do, not only with regard to old ships but new ships, would be done to bring the war to a successful end.   The question seemed to be that in discussing an offensive in German waters, the submarine menace was so great that new ships would be sunk by them in any event if the submarines were not overcome.   The Conference might be of the opinion that this danger is so great that it is of use to sacrifice anything to diminish this clanger.   The winter was coming on now, and it would give Russia time to breathe a little they were in a critical position at present.   If it was possible to bottle up Heligoland it would not only relieve the pressure in the North Sea, but would perhaps also relieve Russia in the Baltic.   The distance from Germany to the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland was about 400 miles.   The German fleet would have to withdraw and be withdrawn very quickly  if  Germany expected, or has reasonable ground for expecting, any offensive in the North Sea, and this would result in great relief to Russia. It would be remembered that early in the war the Allies had to help each other, and that offensive measures on the Eastern front, were taken to relieve the pressure on the Western front.   In the same way Italy was at the present time helping to relieve the pressure&apos; by her offensives.    Therefore he thought that any offensive operation in the North Sea has to be regarded not only as a last measure, but an operation which will have an effect from a military point of view.SIR ERIC GEDDES stated that he thought the Conference would fully appreciate that point of view if it were possible to make a naval offensive in the iSorth Sea at the present time, and that it might relieve Russia.   He thought the
before we can farther consider the question of such an operation, should the time arise, we must first of all know from our Allies whether they would be prepared to provide those ships. I will give the number of ships required, all of which are necessary if we carry out the operation.	Battleships.

Conference would appreciate that point, and perhaps at a later stage we could come to discuss that, but at the moment would continue with Sir John Jellicoe&apos;s points, and come back later on to the point just mentioned.REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI asked what number of ships would be required altogether.ADMIRAL JELLICOE replied that forty battleships and forty-three cruisers would be necessary.SIR ERIC GEDDES stated that two battleships and seven cruisers would be asked of Japan, and perhaps Admiral Funakoshi would make a note of it and later on say whether in the event of such an operation the Japanese Government would consider this contribution.REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI mentioned that from his experience it would be a very difficult operation. He thought his Government would be willing to provide the ships if the operation was decided upon.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI also thought it was a very big job. Some of the ships of the Italian navy were not totally disabled, and they were very useful. Here he described the condition of certain named ships. As far as the proposed operation was concerned, he was of opinion that it would be very good to stop the exit of the submarines, and that any sacrifice would be worth while.SIR ERIC GEDDES then asked whether we should take it as agreed that the Conference had heard Sir John Jellicoe&apos;s statement, and that the representatives would consider the possibility of the contribution of ships on the lines suggested, so that we may hear in time of their views, subject to a reasonable chance of success i-f that operation is carried out.   Was that the view of the Conference ?(This was agreed,)Item 2.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then referred to the second item as follows :- The second method by which we might hope to stop the exit of German submarines would be by an effective mine or net barrage. That we have considered, of course, on many occasions. We have laid a very large number of mines in the Heligoland Bight, but our mines had not met with the success they deserved. Whether it is due to the pattern of the mine, or whether it is due to the fact that German submarines have had extraordinary luck, I do not know. I do not think we get many German submarines by mines. In order to clear up that point we are going to run some of our submarines against our own mines. Our mines at present are not laid in the Heligoland Bight close in ; they were at the beginning of the war. They are not laid, of course, in a regular line or barrage. We have gradually got further and further away from German rivers for the positions for laying down mines, and owing to the distance which we are now from the German bases, they find it very difficult to send out sweepers to sweep the channels owing to the risk of our light forces catching their mine-sweepers. The result has been that the German submarines have been more or less forced into passing along the coast, as far as the observations of our own submarines can tell us. It appears that the result of our minefields is to force the submarines, or a very large proportion, to go in and out of the German bases through territorial waters or Dutch territorial waters.There is the alternative of laying a minefield in the North Sea, in a position where the enemy sweepers cannot reach without running very considerable risk. In view of our present experience I do not think that would have much more result than our present policy; but if a mine is produced which is more effective against submarines than our own mines, the matter, perhaps, becomes somewhat different. Wre are on the pi)int of getting now large numbers of a new pattern of mine, which we have ourselves designed, but laying a barrage across the North Sea involves such very large numbers of mines that it would be a very Jong time before we commenced the barrage. I do not think one could contemplate it with less than 100,000 mines, and it would take a very long time to get 100,000 mines. We get our mines slowly. Our problem is then : Is it better to put them down as we get them, or is it better to wait until we get a very large number and lay a complete barrage across the North Sea. If you lay your mine-fields as you get your mines, the minefields are rather small, and when you come to lay a minefield you. have to avoid the locality of those already laid. You are not certain of the position to a few miles, because of the difficulties of fixing your position accurately after a considerable run across the North Sea. Therefore you have to give the old [984] &quot;    E
minefield a berth of some miles, with the result that there is always a gap between successive minefields. As everybody &quot;knows, it is necessary to give freedom of action for our fleet in the North Sea, A barrier of mines across the centre of the North Sea, or from the North or South part of the North Sea, might interfere with the movements of the fleet, and possibly prevent our gaining a victory over the High Seas Fleet. This difficulty might be faced, provided we were certain that a minefield so laid would be effective in stopping submarines from getting out of the North Sea.It is obvious a minefield so laid would have to be at some considerable distance from German ports, because it would require to be watched, and it would require a very large number of vessels to watch it, and if the watching vessels were dispersed, as they would have to be, it would be quite easy for the Germans to send out a superior force at any point and destroy the watching vessels in the same way as we attempt to destroy their own mine-sweepers.A great deal depends upon whether the mine is a satisfactory one. In the North Sea the seas are very heavy, and mines laid near the surface seldom remain there for the winter. The constant jerk of the moorings in heavy seas of mines laid near the surface breaks the moorings apart and mines go adrift. If we could get a mine which had not this disadvantage, it might be worth while laying a barrage when we get a sufficient number.One cannot say more than that the question is one which we are constantly considering, and if we see any possibility of success of laying the minefield wre think it might be done.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI then said that he did not know the type of mine mentioned, but that in a general way mining could be very successful against submarines, and that their experience was exactly as had been said.The fact was that when mines were in insufficient depth they easily get adrift, but if a suitable mine could be found for use in this manner against the German submarines it would be very valuableHe suggested a line of mines, leaving a known passage for the fleet.REAR-ADMIRAL KRDROFF said he would like to draw attention to one matter. From his point of view it was undesirable to put a mine barrage in the middle of the North Sea in view of the possubility of a big fleet action there. He would group minefields close in to German bases.In the Baltic their experience was that the Germans always tried to make a way for their submarines by means of trawlers, but each time the mines were removed they were replaced by the Russians at night.One idea would be to have special mine-layers with really small draft of water, 6 or 7 feet, which could sail over the minefield.If thirty mine-layers were available a lot of mines could be laid each night in Heligoland Bight, and it might be possible to block the German submarines.ADMIRAL JELL1COE asked whether this was happening now. and whether it was their experience in the Russo-Japanese war.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF said that in the Russo-Japanese war each day they swept the mines, and each night the Japanese laid the mines again.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then said we had no ships of such shallow draft, and that if we had they would not be fit to work in the North Sea.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF suggested laving mines at a depth of 15 feet, but- ADMIRAL JELLICOE pointed out that then the submarines would go over the surface at high water.He further said that we laid our mines from 9 to 10 feet from the surface at low water, but the submarines could get over on the surface at high tide. If we laid mines at a less depth than about 9 or 10 feet from the surface, a Zeppelin could see them at once. Moreover, if we laid mines close in to Heligoland we should have to sweep away the mines alreadj&apos;- there before we could get in.A. vessel drawing 6 feet of water would not be able to work in the North Sea.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON then stated that to follow tout the idea of Sir John Jellicoe it must first of all be decided what type of mine should be used, and then we must have a great number of them ; but he did not think it possible at the present moment to establish a barrage, but only thought it possible to have local fields.
ADMIRAL MAYO approved the idea of a mine barrage involving patrol by the Allied Fleet, provided always that we had confidence in the efficiency of the mine which would be laid. He thought that this promised really more in the way of results than the proposed operations in regard to the convoy of ships.SIR, ERIC GEDDES said that he understood the general view of the Conference to be that in the first place it should be seen that we got a mine which was entirely reliable and satisfactory under all circumstances.In the second place, the difference in the rise and fall of the tide here created a situation quite different to that which exists in the Adriatic, where there is no tide, and where the Italian Navy had had successes and also disasters from mines, and that we had to consider circumstances rather different to those which obtained in the operations which the Italian Admiral had spoken of.The R-ussian experience of shallow-draft mine-layers in the Gulf of Riga appeared to have been successful, but it would be difficult to use such vessels in the North Sea owing to the bad weather we experience and the distance from our ports. There is also the difficulty of the rise and fall of tide.As regards Admiral de Bons view, the probabilities of success, having regard to the necessity for a large number of mines, would be greater if we applied the mines close in shore rather than across the North Sea.Admiral Mayo&apos;s view was that a mine barrage with effective mines could probably be more usefully applied across the North Sea, allowing the Fleet to work on inner lines.He then asked Sir John Jellicoe whether there was anything which he wished to ask the Conference in the way of assistance in mining arrangements.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that mines were coming in fairly rapidly, but that we had not a sufficient number of fitters to assemble them. If the Allies could help us in that respect, we should undoubtedly be, able to get the new mines laid much quicker than we can now.Discussion then took place as to the type of personnel required for this work, and the difficulty of taking men from merchant shipbuilding for this work.SIR ERIC GEDDES then said that perhaps the various representatives would see what they could do to help us in that respect.YICE- ADMIRAL SIMS then said that one point which had not been brought out was the chance of success of the mine barrage as an operation against submarines. It must be successful completely or it is not successful at all. It was not a question of stopping 50 per cent, of the submarines from coming out, because he imagined there were only two or three per day coming out and two or three going in, and if that were so the effect of the barrage would be neutralised.Submarines did not attack fighting vessels; they attacked lines of communication. Submarines would make every effort to get out. Either the barrage is successful absolutely or it fails absolutely.Another point. It had been casually remarked that, unless a mine barrage was efficiently patrolled, anyone could make a hole in it, which meant the patrolling of a line 240 miles in length.SIR ERIC GEDDES said that if the Germans got two submarines through per day and two back per day at present, and if a barrage prevented more than one passing-each way per day, the success would be 50 per cent, of our anticipations.He quite agreed that everything possible in addition should be done to embarrass the submarines.VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS also said that, as he understood the proposal, a large number of vessels would be required to protect the barrage on the assumption that it would be perfectly successful, but that we could not afford to sacrifice what we were doing now with only a chance of success.SIR ERIC GEDDES stated that the barrage was proposed with the object, first of all, of destroying submarines which bumped into it, and, secondly, of endeavouring to stop the flow of submarines through. If two got through in a week instead of fourteen, we would have at any rate succeeded in part.He did not understand froni the remarks of the First. Sea Lord that the barrage should take the place of other offensive measures.   It is not considered that the barrage
can be sufficiently relied upon to take the place entirely of other measures for hunting and destroying submarines.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that we had been trying to maintain a barrage at Dover during the whole of the war, but had not yet succeeded. The whole trouble was the tide and the nature of the bottom, which was like a billiard table. The tide was very strong.SIR ERIC GEDDES then asked whether any member of the Conference had any suggestions to make.Item 3.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that the difficulty with which we were faced when any offensive operations against submarines were proposed was that the British Navy is strained to its utmost limit, and has been throughout the war, in guarding the communications of ourselves and our Allies for overseas forces, and that this has left us with nothing except the vessels of the Grand Fleet with which we could take offensive measures against enemy submarines. Consequently, when we come to the proposal which is down upon the Agenda Paper No. 3-&quot; Offensive Measures Against Enemy Submarines in the North Sea &quot;-we are at once troubled with the fact of where are we going to get the vessels to take offensive measures ? If we take them away from trade protection, and the offensive measures fail, our ships will be sunk. We may gamble on possible success and take away a portion of our patrols, and that is what we are proposing to do.There must always be a risk, because we are never able to get a sufficient number of vessels to keep our protective measures going and take offensive measures, and we have got to reduce protective measures if we propose to take offensive measures. We propose now to commence to do so. We have established in the North Sea a flotilla of vessels to try and sink enemy submarines as they go out of the North Sea, Of course we have always had offensive measures in so far as our resources have permitted, but these resources have been entirely those which*the Grand Fleet has been able to provide, viz., destroyers and submarines.The North Sea is constantly patrolled in certain portions by submarines, which, as I stated earlier, frequently fire on enemy submarines but without much success, as a submarine is a very difficult target to hit with a torpedo. We also, whenever we find a suitable opportunity and destroyers are available, endeavour-to hunt the submarines on their passage out or in, but the hunting of submarines in a large place like the North Sea involved an. immense number of destroyers, and the results have not been very satisfactory.The increasing efficiency of the hydrophone, however, leads us to hope that by the establishment of a flotilla in the North Sea, consisting largely of trawlers fitted with hydrophones, working in conjunction with destroyers and kite balloons towed by sloops  the whole patrol being safeguarded by vessels from the Grand Fleet we may meet with more success against the submarines on the passage out than we have hitherto. We are taking steps to start this arrangement. The number of trawlers which we propose to employ is at present thirty-two, together with about four sloops, and eight destroyers as constantly as we can keep them out there. They will work on the routes which, so far as we are able to ascertain from information given by our submarines or patrol craft, the enemy submarines are taking. In order to do this we have had to withdraw a certain number of trawders from patrols, and therein lies the risk.We are, it is true, building trawlers as rapidly as possible, and a portion of the thirty-two will come from those which are being built.The only other offensive measures which we are constantly taking against enemy submarines beyond, of course, the offensive measures which the convoy system involves are, as I said, (l) watching the North Sea on the supposed routes, and the supposed exits from German waters of enemy vessels, and (2) submarines which work on the track of enemy submarines on the West Coast of Ireland. There, again, our submarines frequently engage enemy submarines, but successes are not very numerous. A submarine, as everyone knows, is a very difficult target owing to the difficulty in estimating her course and speed and the small target shown, and also because of the uncertainty of the depth at which to set the torpedo. For instance, yesterday one of our submarines reported that though she had fired four torpedoes at an enemy submarine 600 yards away, they all missed. This is frequently happening, but although we only occasionally get a submarine, it has considerable moral effect on enemy submarines in cramping their activities.I should have mentioned one other offensive measure which has given better results
than anything else during the recent fine weather. This [is seaplanes-especially the larger seaplanes, which carry heavy bombs.We have been using kite balloons freely for observation with submarines and destroyers working in company, and these have had certain success in locating sub-marines and putting destroyers on to them, but certainly, for the number employed, the most efficient anti-submarine craft we have at this moment are the big seaplanes, but they, of course, cannot work far afield.&quot;VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON stated that they had no other means at their disposal than we had, and that all their means have up to the present been employed in defensive measures. The totality of their resources are employed in this manner.Their resources have been increasing lately, and permit them now to undertake offensive measures, and the measures they are undertaking are effective, in his opinion, because a submarine which has once been chased or harried in any way does not come back again into that area, or does not press the attack in the same manner, and becomes timid.In two cases when convoys were attacked the patrols and seaplanes together succeeded in beating off the atr,ack, and in that area the next time the convoy went through they were not harried in the least, but were left alone.However, an enormous number of these patrol boats are necessary, and at the present moment everything must be concentrated in this manner.VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS asked if he might make a few remarks in regard to the offensive measure of protecting merchant vessels and convoys.He said that the enemv did not wish to fight vessels of a military character, he wanted to get away and attack merchant ships.Further, when destroyers try to get into action the enemy refuses action, and gets below the surface.Therefore anything which could be done to force the enemy submarine to give battle would be an offensive measure.If we put destroyers (which he dreads) round merchant convoys we absolutely force him to give battle in order to get hold of the merchant ships.Convoys are coining as high as twenty-four vessels, and are being convoyed by-eight destroyers, sometimes five, and a number of other vessels, manifestly insUffici3nt, and even with that he did not know of more than one or two cases where a submarine had dared to dive underneath the escort. When convoyed vessels were in columns of this kind-all of them zig-zagging&apos; the destroyers zig-zagging independently, the Conference could imagine what it must look like to the man at the periscope. He would have to have real grit to dive underneath in an attempt to get at the merchant ships.When the time came and their forces were increased so that they could add another string on the outside, Admiral Sims did not think that a submarine could get one vessel out of that convoy. It could only fire at a ship at 5,000 to 6,000 yards with a certain chance of making a hit, and when they got destroyers to make a second string he did not think the enemy submarines could succeed against them.[After a short adjournment.)SIR ERIC GEDDES : We were taking Item 3, and Admiral de Bon had given us his views.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI : I must say that I agree with Admiral de Bon, in saying that the first step in fighting submarines is hunting them and not giving them any rest, and I think the best means of doing this is by employing seaplanes, as mentioned by Admiral Sims.SIR ERIC GEDDES : Large seaplanes with bombs ?VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI: Yes, chasing them with seaplanes.REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI expressed the view that the best means of successfully dealing with submarines was to concentrate upon endeavouring to mine them in, and that when they were in the open sea there appeared to be no other-means of destroying them beyond those mentioned by Admiral Jellicoe, Vice-Admiral de Bon, and Vice-Admiral Sims.[984] F
VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI: I am of the same opinion as regards action against submarines; that it must be an offensive action, and that it should not be reduced to a defensive action. For the offensive we have, as has been said, aeroplanes, destroyers, and trawlers, and I should add motor-boats, near the coasts in fair weather. Then we have nets, torpedoes, artillery, and also guns mounted on ships. With regard to the action by guns from ships, it has been observed -that the target being so difficult, the action is not so efficient as is desirable.Turning to the question of employing aeroplanes with large quantities of explosives, I can mention some cases in which this offensive has been really effective.(Instances were given.)It seems to us that it would be desirable, if possible, to attack the submarine bases We are dome- so in the case of the Austrian bases. As has been pointed out, one of the most effective offensives against the action of submarines is to demolish or to endeavour to damage them in their bases. It is not only the offensive at sea that is important, but it is the harassing of the enemy by damaging- the bases of submarines.Returning to the question of the sea action against submarines, I think that offensive must be carried out in a very hard and continuous manner, in order to obtain, if not the sinking of the submarine effectivelv, at least the harassing of the boats.In conclusion, I would say that there are three systems of dealing with the submarine : one is fighting the submarine at sea, and we have heard of the best measures that are being taken in this direction ; the second is attacking submarines, not from the sea, but from the air ; and the third is to damage and destroy, if possible, the bases of the submarines. There is also of course another system in operation, and that is the use of decoy ships.SIR. ERIC GEDDES: I would like to know whether in the opinion of the Confererence there is any method of attacking a submarine at sea that appears to be more successful than any other method. Is it by submarine against submarine ; is it by destroyer, or is it by patrol ships corrying a gun and waiting for the submarine ?VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI: I think that the method of submarine against submarine is a very dangerous system.SIR EPtIC GEDDES : Now, if you had a limited capacity in your shipbuilding so that you could not build all the ships that you would like to build, and you could build something to destroy submarines, what would you choose?VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI: I would choose trawlers and destroyers. Then, of course, there are the nets and torpedoes.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : I think that the destroyer is the means which the enemy dislikes above all. The men who have been captured have been unanimous in their view that their chief enemy is the destroyer. I think the best means we can use at sea is the destroyer.SIR ERIC GEDDES : So that if you had a limited shipbuilding capacity, and you wished to build against submarines, you would build destroyers?VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON : Certainly.SIR ERIC GKDDES : Is that your view, too, Admiral Sims ?VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS : Yes, that is my view ; except that you would, of course, build submarines for certain special services The submarine is a very efficient scout to notify when enemy submarines are coming out, but for attack against submarines, destroyers are the most effective ; and a destroyer in combination with a kite balloon, I think, is probably about the most dangerous thing a submarine has to encounter. Then, of course, another means of attack is a very large seaplane which can drop bombs of 230 lb. The combination of those things is bound to have a very marked effect, but I think the sooner they can. put the kite balloon on the destroyer, the more effective will be the work against the submarine.SIR ERIC GEDDES: So that your view, from what you have seen since you came over here, is that a destroyer with a kite balloon is the thing that the submarine dreads most of all.VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS : Yes. The conviction on our side is, as Admiral Mayo will tell you, that the destroyer is the vessel that ought to be built; and we are laying
down a programme of 116, to be followed to a further programme of 220 destroyers. We have given up the building of 1 iO-feet motor-boats.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF expressed the view that the best means of fighting submarines was to attack them at their bases and mine them in, or, when they were in the open, to attack them with large seaplanes.SIR, ERIC GEDDES: Admiral Duff, you have certain views as to the best offensive against submarines, have you not ? -REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : I think there are several weapons which are equally good. I have a very strong belief in submarine v. submarine, if the submarine is built for the purpose-not with a submarine built entirely for attacking surface vessels. I do not know whether it is possible to build an ideal submarine to attack a submarine, but I think we ought to be able to get higher submerged speed for submarines, which is the first essential.SIR ERIC GEDDES : For a short distance ?REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF: Yes. What is also wanted is a number of not necessarily large torpedoes, say, 14-inch torpedoes, set at different depths and at divergent angles.SIR ERIC GEDDES : You mean firing them in a battery ?REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF: Yes.SIR ERIC GEDDES : Your view, from your experience, is that that is probably the means that is likely to give the best results ?REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : Submarines are of little use for escort work, but I think, within limits, it is as effective as any other weapon we have got. The enemy is at the present time concentrating submarines in the mouth of the Channel, and I think the best answer to that will be to attack him with submarines, because if you get one or two of our submarines amongst theirs, it destroys concentration at once.SIR ERIC GEDDES : You think that the destroyer is probably the best offensive against submarines, but you are of opinion that to harass enemy submarines the best means is to use submarines against them.REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : Yes. I do not think that the results which the destroyers have given have been great. A destroyer frightens a submarine more than anything else.SIR; ERIC GEDDES : Your experience on the limited number of attacks that you can get over a certain period shows that the percentage of successful attack is in favour of submarine v. submarine.REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : Yes, I think so ; but the areas they work in have to be taken into account.SIR ERIC GEDDES : If you take the total number of attacks over a given period b)^ each seacraft the best percentage in success is given by submarine v. submarine.ADMIRAL MAYO : jThat would depend upon the location of your own submarine.SIR ERIC GEDDES : That would be so, I think, if you were taking the number of successful attacks per craft, but this is the percentage of success on the actual attacks delivered. If your submarines get twice the number of opportunities to attack that a destroyer gets, that does not vitiate the figure. It is the percentage of successful attacks of the total number of attacks delivered. It is a small figure, and can very easily be changed, but it does give that result. Admiral Duffs point is that there is a very definite offensive role for submarine v. submarine, which has so far with us given a higher percentage of successful attacks than anything else.REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI: Of course submarine against submarine might be sometimes very useful. Aly idea is that if you put your submarines in a suspected area of enemy submarines, [ think they can do something for them; but if you put only one in a suspected area j^ou run the risk of your submarine being attacked.
SIR. ERIC GEDDES : Then I think we can summarise the result of our discussion on item 3 as follows: The Conference is of the opinion that there are three ways of taking offensive measures against the submarine, in addition to the offensive of the escort which Admiral Sims brought out. Those three ways are to attack the bases, to mine them in, and to attack them at sea ; and that generally if you were to prescribe one particular class of vessel for sea attack the Conference is further of the opinion that, although no one is a specific, the best all-round measure is the destroyer with the kite balloon, but that there is a legitimate field of operations and scope for submarine v. submarine. Apart from everything that has been put forward, in the first place by Admiral Jellicoe, the Conference has no other means to suggest that could be adopted to attack submarines, but simply to increase the means I have mentioned. Is that the conclusion of the Conference ?   (Agreed.)ADMIRAL JELLICOE: There is one other point which perhaps has not been brought out in the discussion, and that is that the attack on submarines probably gives better results if it is carried out in waters in which the submarine cannot go to the bottom and lie. That is the difficulty we always have to face in the English Channel. In most cases they can go to the bottom and sit there when they are pressed.SIR ERIC GEDDES : You mean that in a heavy tideway she cannot submerge ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I mean that in deep water she cannot go much below 25 fathoms.SIR ERIC GEDDES : So that your best chance is in deep water?ADMIRAL JELLICOE : Yes. For that reason the Adriatic is particularly good.Item 4.SIR ERIC GEDDES : Shall we go now to Item 4 ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The next question was put on the agenda paper owing to the action which has recently been taken in the Atlantic in the vicinity of Azores by the German submarine &quot; Deutschland,&quot; which has resulted in rather heavy losses to Allied shipping, and further as to our knowledge that, there are at least six large ocean-going cruiser type submarines shortly to be completed in German dockyards. Undoubtedly all these submarines wili operate at a very long distance from Home Waters, and will require therefore special measures to combat the menace. We have investigated the matter, and the conclusion at which we have arrived is, first of all. that it will be necessaiw to put, at any rate at the beginning, everything under convoy, because these big submarines, operating far from their bases, naturally rely more upon their guns than upon their torpedoes, owing to the comparatively small number of torpedoes which they can carry. At any rate, that was our experience in the case of the &quot;Deutschland.&quot; Of the ships that were sunk (I think the number was 29), only 2 were sunk by torpedo ; the wdiole of the remainder were sunk by gunfire, and it was particularly noticeable that the vessels which did not escape at all were those which were unarmed, namely, the Neutrals. Therefore the ocean-going submarine will be a particular menace to Neutral shipping, because Neutral shipping is not armed.SIR ERIC GEDDES : I think I am right in sajdng that of the unarmed Neutral ships attacked not one escaped ?ADMIRAL JELLICOE : I think there were 19 British and Allied ships attacked, of which 10 escaped ; and of 10 Neutrals attacked none escaped. Of course, one way of protecting the Neutrals themselves is to put them into convoy. It is objectionable in some ways, because the Neutrals some of them, at any rate are in the pay of the enemy and give away our arrangements, but Neutral shipping which is in the employ of the Allies must go under convoy. When we come later to consider the question of sea convoy, 1 am afraid that we shall have to point out that it will be very difficult for us to carry out our proposal of putting everything under convoy unless we can get some assistance from our Allies in the provision of cruisers or men-of-war to become the convoying cruisers.   We ha\re used up every vessel that we have.Another proposal which we consider is a very necessary one to carry out is to increase the arrangements for giving warnings by W/T to vessels in the Atlantic. At the present moment we cannot net in touch with merchant ships which are far away from wireless stations, and we shall be suggesting later in the Conference the
establishment of wireless stations in the Azores which can repeat the warnings which are issued from Gibraltar and elsewhere, and which can also give information to merchant ships as to the position of submarines as far as is known. That wireless station in the Azores will necessarily be combined with the establishment of an intelligence centre there.The other arrangements which we suggest shall be put into force to tackle the ocean-going submarines are, first of all, the employment of decoy ships and submarines working in concert. The chances of a submarine attacking an enemy submarine successfully are naturally very much increased if she is working with a decoy surface-ship which can give her information. It is an extension of our ocean patrol when we arm colliers and fit them with wireless to work ahead of our cruisers to give them information of the sighting of any suspicious craft. Similarly, submarines, if accom-panied by a decoy ship, will have a much better opportunity of intercepting an enemy submarine than if they were working alone.Another and most important measure which requires consideration by the whole of the Allies is that we should take immediate steps to exercise efficient supervision over all likely places in our own possessions abroad and strengthen our intelligence organisations in neutral countries, so that probable bases of submarines and supply vessels can be watched.The particular places where it is quite possible that submarine bases may be set up are Labrador and Canada, sparsely populated centres; the United States coast, which in some places is also sparsely populated, Mexico and Central America particularly. It is most important that we should prevent any submarine operations down there, because it means that they will be operating against our oil carriers, and we are even now very short of oil; we cannot afford to lose much of it. Brazil and the whole of South America, especially the German settlements in Brazil, Argentina, Patagonia, and - Chile. The Falkland Islands is also another place which requires watching, and West Africa. I would suggest that all. the Allies should take steps to increase the very strict supervision which is now exercised, but which will certainly be much more necessary as these big submarines get afloat. So far as my information goes, it is not probable that an)^ of those submarines will be operating before at any rate the middle or the end of October, so that there is time to take any necessary measures. It seems probable that the &quot;Deutschland&quot; has recently returned, at any rate her activities have ceased, and for the moment the ocean is clear.VICE-ADMIRAL C US AN I: I can say that against the submarine cruisers, that is. the submarines which can stay a very long time at sea, and consequently become very dangerous against liners, the idea of Rear-Admiral Duff was very good : to have submarine cruisers sufficiently armed and in a condition to fight against them. That is the only case in which 1 adhere to submarine against submarine, because if you have a submarine which is well armed with good guns and can effectively fight against the other submarine, that, to my mind, solves the problem. If there had been a submarine in the vicinity of Azores, where the &quot; Deutschland &quot; has caused so much damage, the losses would have been diminished and the &quot; Deutschland &quot; probably sunk.I am not in a position to speak with regard to the traffic routes in the Atlantic, because we are Mediterranean people, but I entirely agree with all that Admiral Jellicoe has said.REAR-ADMIRAL FUNAKOSHI : I am afraid I cannot say anything about this matter at present.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON said : Th ese submarine cruisers go out for a certain time, three months or so, and they are obliged to have a supply vessel. This vessel is either a neutral or a captured vessel, and enables them to prolong their voyage. The best means to discover this vessel is what we have to aim at, and destroyers would be the best means of discovering such a vessel; but on account of the inferiority of armament, the destroyers would have to go in pairs. Our merchant-ships are armed with light guns, and found that they were outranged by the submarines. Now that the submarines are armed with 6-inch guns it would be necessary to increase the armament of the merchant-ships. -VICE-ADMIRAL SIMS : It seems to me that the whole question of our position as regards the submarine cruiser is bound up with the question of the future convoy system.   I do not think we should be satisfied with taking measures tiiat would oppose the submarine cruiser only, and then find that they were quite insufficient to oppose [984] &apos; G
the action of the raider which carries a number of 6-inch guns, and perhaps a number of 7 o-inch guns. I think those are two points which will have to be taken up together. I entirely agree with Admiral Jellicoe, and particularly with Admiral de Bon, that if you want to oppose a submarine carrying a 6-inch gun, you will certainly have to put a 6-in&apos;ch gun on board any vessel that is sent after the submarine, or else the vessel will have to go in convoy, supported by a, cruiser with guns equal in range to those of the submarine. There are numbers of different kinds of vessels conducting ships across the ocean, now, and I think those convoys are in danger of the 6-inch guns of the big-submarines when they come out.   That of course will have to be provided for..There is another question which must inevitably come up, and that is as to what the enemy is likely to do if he finds that the convoy system when it is put more fully into operation threatens to defeat his attack on commerce. It is a question of what he is going to do about it. Is he going to sit down on it, or is he going to sacrifice some of his vessels for the purpose of breaking up the convoy system ? I have heard it stated that they would certainly send out their cruisers in bunches of two or three to attack a convoy. On one of those expeditions, if they succeeded in destroying the vessel escorting the convoy, the)^ would destroy all the vessels in the convoy. I have also heard it stated as an opinion that as a more or less desperate measure, the enemy-might send out one or two battle-cruisers, having made arrangements to coal these in various parts of the world. To counteract that, you have to do one of two things: either you have got to convoy with Dreadnought battleships, or else you have got to make the best terms of peace you can. Those two points must be taken up as a whole.ADMIRAL MAYO : I have nothing to add to that.SIR. ERIC GEDDES: There were two points that Admiral Jellicoe raised upon which 1 think there has been no direct comment. One was the question of the Allies making cruisers available for the convoy work ; and the other was the question of the Allies in concert taking all the steps in their power to prevent enemy hases for submarines being formed either in countries belonging to the Allies or where they have considerable influence. Those appear to me to be important points which, if Admiral Jellicoe agrees, I think we might ask the representatives of the Allies here to give us their views upon, and I would suggest that those two points might be left over till to-morrow, and when the Conference meets again we could resume the discussion upon them.The question of cruisers for convoy work brings us immediately to the points that Admiral Sims has so very pertinently raided; but we are not now considering merely an extension of the present submarine warfare. We are discussing an extension of it with quite a different class of submarine, carrying a 6-inch gun, and Admiral Sims suggests that later on we may have cruisers, or even battle-cruisers, to deal with on the trade routes. Of course there are many aspects of that question. They have got to get out first, and then to get freedom of action ; hut still Admiral Sims&apos;s point is very pertinent, and if the Conference agrees with my suggestion, unless any member is prepared to speak on it now, I propose that those two points the question of Allied cruisers being made available for convoy work, and the question of co-operative measures by the Allies to prevent enemy submarine bases being formed in parts of the world where we have influence-should stand over till to-morrow&apos;s Conference, and that the representatives of the Allies should then give their views. Is that suggestion acceptable to the Conference ?   (Agreed.)   Then shall we proceed to item 5 ?Item 5.ADMIRAL JELLICOE: The general situation in regard to convoys is this : During the past three months a great advance has been made in the development of mercantile convoys and much experience has been gained. The present condition of affairs- in regard to convoys is as follows : One convoy starts from Canada, Sydney (Cape Breton) being the port of assembly, every eight days. The average number of ships in the convoy is 18, and the ocean escort is provided by 5 British cruisers. One convoy starts every eight days from New York; it also averages 18 ships, and 6 United States cruisers are working this convoy. Another convoy starts from Hampton Roads every four days. The average number of ships in each convoy is 22, a total of 44. For that purpose there are 12 British vessels : 4 cruisers and 8 specially armed merchant ships. A convoy starts from Halifax every eight days. The average number of ships in that convoy is 12 ; 5 British armed auxiliary cruisers are the
convoying vessels. A convoy starts from Dakar every eight days, consisting of the Southern Atlantic trade, and the convoying vessels, of which there are 6, are British mercantile auxiliarj^ cruisers. Another convoy starts from Sierra Leone every eight days, with an average of 10 ships, 5 British mercantile cruiser; acting as convoy vessels. A convoy starts from Gibraltar every four days ; the average number in each convoy is 17, and 10 convoying vessels are used, 6 being what are termed special service ships, 3 armed boarding steamers, and 1 sloop. The last list of convoying steamers shows to what straits we are reduced to enable us to provide convoying ships. The total force at present employed in the submarine danger zone is 70 destroyers, which includes 27 United States destroyers. There are also 11 sloops and 48 trawlers employed. In addition to those the following forces are employed for subsidiary escort duties, that is to say, escort along the coast: II destroyers and i5 vessels of the &quot; P &quot; class. The danger zone escort at Gibraltar consists of sloops, yachts, and torpedo-boats, and will shortly be reinforced by 22 United States vessels under Admiral Wilson of the United States Navy. Our organisation of convoys is that the escorting cruiser collects the vessels in the port of assembly, and in addition to the commanding officer of the escorting cruiser we have a special officer called the commodore of the convoy, who sails in one of the merchant vessels leading the centre column of the formation. He leads the convoy, and in the event of the cruisers having to leave the convoy for any purpose, the commodore of the convoy takes charge. We impress upon our convoying vessels the necessity for having as broad a front to the convoy as possible, and experience shows that merchant ships keep better station in line abreast than in line ahead. We aim at getting 20 vessels in each convoy, but we do not always succeed in that. We sometimes have more, but more frequently there are less, because to obtain more would delay the traffic too much.The principal difficulty we have to consider is the speed of the convoy. We have at present slow and fast convoys. The slow convoys of less than 12 knots and the fast convoys of 12 knots and upwards, except that we do not include vessels of f 6 knots and over.One of our difficulties in using any vessel other than a man-of-war as an escorting measure is the inferiority of their wireless installation. It is essential to keep communication with the convoy and to establish communication with the convoy when it is at a maximum distance from the coast of Ireland. Particularly is this the case if we are trying to arrange for the escorting vessels of an outward convoy to meet and bring home the homeward-bound convoy. Obviously we must receive the earliest intimation of any alteration in the date on which a homeward convoy is expected to reach a destination, in order that the sailing of the outward convoy may be adjusted accordingly : and although we are now working a system of outward and homeward convoys with the same flotilla of destroyers through the submarine zone (and trawlers in the case of Gibraltar convoy), we feel there is going to be great difficulty, if not impossibility of working a system when the weather gets bad, owing to the difficulty of arranging for an outward convoy to get to the rendezvous at the right time. Admiral Duff, who has consulted merchant captains of considerable experience, has, I think, arrived at the conclusion himself that we shall have to give up altogether the convoying of vessels outward in the winter.In addition to the destroyers and other vessels which bring the convoy into the submarine zone, we attach, as far as we can, rescue tugs, in order that the tugs may pick up any disabled ship. We also endeavour to meet convoys with aircraft and vessels with kite balloons.The general conclusions which we have arrived at in regard to the convoy system so far is that it may be regarded as a successful defensive measure against submarine attack. Only a small proportion of the total losses which occur in convoy have come in the main convoy sj^stem. Losses have been much heavier in the Scandinavian convoy. The fine weather, of course, has greatly assisted us in the convoy system. We have had some, unpleasant experiences recently in the last gale, and last week one convoy of 22 vessels under the &quot; Devonshire&quot; cruiser had to lay-to twenty-four hours clear of the danger zone. When the &quot; Devonshire &quot; proceeded again when the gale abated, only 6 vessels accompanied her, and of the remainder 3 were torpedoed.One of our principal difficulties which will occur in the winter is the fact that the class of tramp vessel is unsuited for work in the Atlantic. Admiral Duff will tell you that merchant captains have to adopt all sorts of devices to get to the United States. They frequently go south of the Azores to get across that would upset any convoy system introduced.As regards cruisers, of which we are short, that will be a question which will be
considered to-morrow. The extension required to complete the existing Atlantic convoy system to British waters would be this: Cruis   iHampton Eoads convoys     ... ... ... 4New York convoy ... ... ... ... ... -Sydney convoy     ... ... ... ---     -Halifax convoy      ... ... ... ... 1i-akar convoy       ... ... ... -Sierra Leone convoy ... ... ... 1Gibraltar convoy   ... ... ... ... ... 4Total    ... ...     .   ... ... ... ...   16This is exclusive of cruisers required for other Atlantic trade for which a large number are wanted.SIB ERIC GEDDES stated that, unless the Conference wished otherwise, he would propose that we take Admiral Jellicoe&apos;s statement on the convoy system as for information. The point which we had left over until to-morrow was the question of cruisers. We have as the next item on the agenda the very important one of the convoy system in the Mediterranean, and up to date, as a defensive measure, as you have all heard and as you know, the convoy system has undoubtedly been a success. Whether it will continue to be a success depends very largely upon the Germans, and we cannot believe that they will discontinue to try and find some way of reducing the success of the convoy system. I hope now that you have had a full explanation of the convoy system which is being worked by the British with the valuable help of the United States, that you will, during the next twelve or eighteen hours, consider whether any of you can assist in any way with cruisers for this particular purpose, and unless the Conference desires otherwise, I would propose to pass to item 6, which is the convoy system in the Mediterranean.Item 6.The matter is of great importance, and of particular importance to Italy; and so far as tonnage is concerned is of the very greatest importance to all the Allies, because if by extending the convoy system in the Mediterranean we can get safe passage there for merchant ships there will be a saving, which means in sailing time 40 per cent, of shipping passing through, so as to avoid the Cape of Good Hope, and to save 40 per cent, on the Far-Eastern shipping is a benefit which the Conference will readily understand, and therefore I suggest that we should go on to item f&apos;, and having heard what Sir John Jellicoe has to tell us on that, that we should adjourn until to-morrow.The importance to the Italians of introducing the convoy system in the Mediterranean is very largely one of their own needs being supplied, both as to safetv of the ships which will go into the Mediterranean for them, and also in the reduction of time in going round the Cape of Good Hope. If we take items 4, 5, and 6, we have got a complete subject, viz , the strengthening of the convoy forces of the Allies, which is most important, and a point which I hope the Conference will be prepared to discuss to-morrow, and we will be able to devise some means of improving it..    REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF stated as follows :-I understand the question is now being considered by an Allied Conference assembled at Malta, and the information I have on the subject is from a Conference held here before the British Commander-in-Chief went out to the Mediterranean,No organised convoy system at present exists in the Mediterranean as a whole. I do not think I need go through present arrangements.   They are disconnected and local.There is no direct convoy system from Gibraltar to Alexandria. Ships in making this passage take advantage of convenient ports on the North African coast during daylight hours and make the greater part of the passage to Malta during the dark hours.   From there escorts to Alexandria and Suda Ray are generally provided.The proposal briefly is to establish a convoy every four days from Gibraltar to Genoa, every eight days from Marseilles to Algiers, and an eight-day convoy from Naples to Bizerta, and a four-day convoy from Gibraltar to Bizerta and from Bizerta to Alexandria.   Further subsidiary convoy routes are also suggested.The Gibraltar to Genoa trade amounts to approximately forty-eight ships every eight days. On the reverse journey the traffic is reduced to thirty-six ships in the same period.Marseilles to Bizerta amounts to approximately twenty ships every eight days. A number of these vessels trade along the North African coast to Oran, from where we propose a convoy to Gibraltar amounting possibly to twelve ships every eight days.
The Bizerta to Naples route would require one convoy of about 10 ships every eight days. Ships discharging at Genoa proceed down the coast to Naples, and from there across to the African coast, where they load chiefly cargoes of iron ore.The route from Malta to Taranto does not carry much traffic, but is important, and amounts to approximately 5 ships in eight days.From Port Said 8 to 9 ships sail weekly to Suda Bay, and from there are convoyed to Salonica.   The trade amounts to about 15 ships per wreek.The above, with a direct route from Gibraltar to Alexandria, include the main line of traffic in the Mediterranean.SIB EPIC GEDDES asked Bear-Admiral Duff what he would require to do that, and what were his available resources.BEAR-ADMIRAL DUFF replied that the figures given in the paper were those stated at the Corfu Conference, giving the total number of vessels available for escort work in the Mediterranean. No cruisers are required for escort, the escorts being composed of destroyers, trawlers, sloops, &amp;c.The total estimated number of vessels required is 286, and the number estimated at the Allied Conference as being available was 212. Balance to be provided is there-fore 74.   Troopship escorts are not included in this estimate.ADMIRAL CUSANI-VISCONTI then gave a statement as to the Italian organisation patrolling the coasts of Italy and Sicily. He mentioned that Admiral Duff had stated they had no convoys, but he would like to correct this. They had, in fact, convoys, and these convoys are escorted by trawlers and by small torpedo-boats. The actions of the submarines were verv much more restricted near the coast, because they had gun fortifications all along the coast, and they had a good service whereby to warn convoys of the submarine.They also had airship stations on the coast at certain points. They had some old ships of no effective value in naval warfare, but which would be very useful for convoy work. Also they had motor-boats. He mentioned that the German submarines had not been very successful so far as Italy was concerned, as up to the 25th August of this year in their waters only 16 ships had been sunk from the 1st March, of which only 9 were Italian, and 7 were of Allied and neutral Powers. He mentioned that he had spoken to Admiral Calthorpe and he had said exactly what Admiral Duff had just said.He had cognisance of their system along the coast of Italy, and he declared that it would be dangerous to alter that system, as it was the result of long experience and the result of long study.He referred to the conversation he had had with Admiral Calthorpe as to the system in force in the Italian Navy, and they would, of course, do everything to satisfy the desires of the British Admiralty. His position here was such that he could not make any definite engagement.   What they wanted very much was, of course, coal.SIR ERIC GEDDES then asked Admiral Funakoshi if he had anything to say about the Mediterranean convoy work. Admiral Funakoshi said that he would prefer to leave it until to-morrow.ADMIRAL DE BON also stated he would prefer to leave this matter over until to-morrow.SIR ERIC GEDDES then said that we should all consider what should be done to increase the convoy forces of the Allied Powers. The fact remained that of all the danger zones, the one where the percentage of loss was highest was the Mediterranean.   It is very difficult to guard that zone.Up to now, by increasing the convoy system, we had managed to get a verv considerable measure of success. We have listened with great interest to Admiral Cusani-Visconti, but the Mediterranean is the most dangerous place we have to day, so that the matter is one of the very greatest importance to all of the Allies, and if we are to put more shipping into the Mediterranean, first of all to supply the pressing-needs of Italy for coal, and, secondly, in order to economise shipping by not going round the Cape ; we must devise some means of giving protection in that area, which most of all requires it. If the Conference is of that opinion, I suggest we should certainly adjourn this question until to-morrow. It is one of the most important questions we have to deal with, and there is nothing more we can consider to-day ; and if the Conference thought well of it, I would suggest that a smdl sub-committee of the Conference should meet early to-morrow, and even now and continue to-morrow morning, [984] 1 H
to consider with Admiral Duff the whole of the convoy arrangements which he has explained, and then when the Conference meets to-morrow we should have a report on this most vital and important question. I would propose we should separate on that understanding, appointing a small sub-committee.ADMIRAL SIMS said he had nothing to say, except that he was in entire accord with the necessity of protection against submarines in the Mediterranean, and was entirely in sympathy with what had been said.After some little discussion it was then decided that a small sub-committee of the Conference should meet that evening, and on the following morning to consider the whole of the convoy arrangements. The United States did not wish to be represented on this sub-committee, which was appointed as follows : Great Britain : Admiral Duff Italy : Admiral Cusani- Visconti. France : Admiral de Bon. Japan: Admiral Funakoshi.ADMIRAL KEDROFF stated that, although he was in agreement generally with the convoy system, he thought that the question of offensive measures against the submarine menace was of far more importance, as although the convoy system was a goud one, it was not altogether immune from submarine attack. He thought it useless to deal with the question of enemy submarines without dealing with the question of the enemy bases. The convoying system by itself was purely a, defensive measure.SIR ERIC GEDDES said that we all agreed with what Admiral Kedroff had said, but the defensive measures are not the only measures to be taken, and while you are dealing in an offensive way with the submarine you have the danger to your overseas trade which has to be met, and therefore the convoy system is as necessary to-day as it was before. If I may, I would point out that we were, earlier in the meeting, discussing the best offensive measures against submarines. Then we came to the convoy sj^stem, and I do not think anyone here would advocate purely defensive measures against submarines, but you have to defend while you are endeavouring to attack.SIR ERIC GEDDES then stated that Sir John Jellicoe pointed out that as Admiral Calthorpe was in the Mediterranean at the present time dealing on behalf of all of us with the convoy system, any conclusions which were come to here at this Conference would have to be subject to the naval authorities in the Mediterranean, but at the same time he felt that it was useful to consider this question now.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said it might be useful to know in considering the question which the First Lord mentioned earlier as to the assistance which we might hope to get from the Allies in regard to escorts, that the following are our requirements : AVe require 4 cruisers or similar vessels for the Gibraltar to the United Kingdom, trade. We require 12 for outward convoys to the Atlantic, and 25 more vessels if we take in the remainder of the Atlantic trade, that is, trade from the United States to Gibraltar, and trade from the south-east coast to Dakar, and trade from the Cape to Dakar, so that altogether we are 41 cruisers short to establish a complete convoy system.Similarly, to establish escorts in the submarine zone we require 44 destrovers or sloops for the convoys outward and 11 for the other Atlantic trade which I have just mentioned. The total we want is therefore 41 more cruisers and 55 more destroyers or sloops.(Tlie Conference then adjourned until.the following day.)
September 5.SIR ERIC GEDDES suggested that item No. 4 should be passed as the report of the Sub-Committee was not ready yet.*He said that on talking matters, over with Admiral Jellicoe he found that there was a point which he had missed yesterday, and which he was very anxious to have investigated. This was the question of enemy submarine bases in Allied or neutral territorv, where the Allies had considerable influence, and the question of discussing and improving, if possible, the Allies&apos; intelligence arrangements. The Conference would remember that this was one of the two points Admiral Jellicoe referred to yesterday, particularly in reference to the Azores.Admiral Jellicoe suggests that we should have a Sub-Committee to consider this question. Therefore, if the Conference agrees with that suggestion, it is proposed that a Sub-Committee should be appointed and should meet this afternoon at 3&quot;30.The suggestion was generally approved, and a Committee appointed, constituted as follows : Admiral Oliver. Admiral Hall. Admiral Salaun. Captain de Rothiacob.Captain-Lieutenant de Carvalho, Portuguese Naval Attache, to be invited to join them.Item 7.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that he did not think it was necessary for him to say much to the Conference about the barrage itself, except that the laying of the British part of it will be commenced shortly.A point which had been discussed at the last Naval Conference, but which he thought perhaps it was wise to discuss once more, was the provision of destroyers for the protection of the drifters which are patrolling the net barrage until we can get the fixed barrage.Since Admiral Calthorpe had arrived in the Mediterranean he had telegraphed that he would be able to maintain a patrol of three destroyers there provided the Italians could do likewise. It was intended to make a permanent, patrol of six destroyers on the barrage, and this would enable drifters to be constantly kept out there, which is not the case at present.The other point which Admiral Calthorpe mentioned in his telegram is the necessity for patrol by submarines and aircraft. He did not know what Admiral Cusani would have to say about that. We had provided thi ee submarines, which are employed near the barrage, and we also have aircraft.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI stated that their experience was that when a patrol is constantly and regularly maintained enemy submarines await a suitable moment and make an attack. They had lost one destroyer in that way. He agreed with Admiral Jellicoe as to aircraft and submarine patrol, but considered a regular patrol was dangerous, especially in the Adriatic, for two reasons :- 1. The enemy can watch from points near at hand. 2. Spying.He agreed, however, that there should be some means of protecting the barrage so that the enemy could be prevented from getting back to their base.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said in regard to the first point which Admiral Cusani raised-the danger of constant destroyer patrol-that we have maintained a constant destroyer patrol in the Straits of Dover for nearly three years, and he thought he was correct in saying that we had never lost a single destroyer by submarine attack. Therefore our experience did not coincide with the Adriatic.Further, it is generallv accepted, and it was accepted at the Conference yesterday, that the class of vessel which the German submarine :eared most was the destroyer.Under these conditions he could not agree that we should do nothing to maintain a constant patrol.
SIR ERIC GEDDES stated that it seemed to him that the point of risk which Admiral Cusani raised was met by the statement of our own experience, and, of course, risks had got to be run. What he would like to ask, however, was whether it was considered a reasonable and fair thing to send out these drifters uncovered. They were simply out there as a live bait for the Austrian forces, and it did not seem to him reasonable to send these men out absolutely unprotected.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that the alternative was to send them out only occasionally when destroyers are out, and that on days when destroyers were not out the submarines would have a free passage.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI explained that he did not propose that the barrage should not be protected, but he was, in principle, against continuous and regular patrolling.   He thought the conditions in the Dover Straits were different.SIR ERIC GEDDES suggested that the Conference might progress a little if they could agree that if the British devoted a sufficient number of destroyers to maintain three on the barrage there, the Italians could take similar action.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said he could not at that moment make anv engagement, but he would certainly see if it could be arranged.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that the point was, the drifters were out there without protection.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI then said that for some months they had a patrol service of a cruiser and destroyers up and down every day, and the result was that the submarines simply waited for them. One Italian destroyer, two French destroyers, and two auxiliary cruisers had been sunk in this way. They then changed their method, and by sending out a torpedo-boat with the drifters this prevented the. submarines from making an attack.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that it was rather unfair to ask drifters to remain out there. The drifters were not manned by naval men. They were manned by fishermen, and not of the naval class at all. It was only at night that this protection was asked for, and a submarine at night was at a great disadvantage compared with a destroyer.   In the Straits of Dover&quot; they were out day and night.SIR- ERIC GEDDES said that some method must be found of protecting the men on the drifters if the barrage was to be maintained at all. It was no satisfaction to the drifters to think that the Austrians were going to be chased when they were going back.CAPTAIN LOVATELLI then gave instances of ships which had been sunk.SIR --ERIC GEDDES then said he did not think the matter could be carried very much further that, day, but he hoped Admiral Cusani would go into the matter and report, because what they would like to do first was to deal with the question of drifters. If the Italians could let us have three destroyers, then we would provide the same number, and would discuss the method of protecting the drifters. He said that it might be satisfactory to us in one way to get the raiders on their return, but it was not satisfactory to the men on the drifters.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that it was not an easy problem to solve.- ADMIRAL JELLICOE then asked whether Admiral de Bon would object to sending three French destroyers.ADMIRAL DE BON said that he would not object at all. He considered that if the barrage was to be continued it must be supported by destroyers. There were all sorts of ways of protecting it in the day-time by aircraft and by submarines- and he concurred with Admiral Jellicoe that what was needed was destroyers to protect the barrage at night.Agreed that Admiral Cusani should take steps to find out whether the Italians could provide three destroyers for this work.Slit ERIC GEDDES said that if this matter could be put to Admiral di Revel, it could perhaps be considered later, upon hearing what could be done by the Italian Navy. The point which he wished to bring to the notice of the Conference was, as he had said yesterday, that from the point of view of destruction of mercantile tonnage,
the Mediterranean was the worst of the areas, and whether when we received the report of the committee on convoys, we would find that they could give us any comfort, or whether, when we heard further about the barrage, .the result would be satisfactory, he did not know. He proposed, however, that these matters of safety of merchant shipping improvement of the barrage, and the laying of it on a permanent basis which is now commencing should form the subject of a Conference of the Allies with their various Governments, to be further discussed at the International Conference which is to take place in. Paris towards the end of September.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that it was important to postpone discussion until Admiral Calthorpe had reported, as they were studying what should be done, and at the present moment they had no clear element for discussion. He agreed with what the First Lord said in regard to waiting until Admiral Calthorpe and Admiral di Revel had sent in their report before coming to conclusions.[Sir Eric Geddes at this stage whs summoned to a meeting of the War Cabinet, andAdmiral Jellicoe took the Chair, jItem 8.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that the next question on the agenda was that of offensive measures against enemy bases in the Adriatic. . Admiral Cusani in his remarks yesterday about operations against submarines laid considerable stress upon the advantages of attacking the bases, and he (Admiral Jellicoe) understood from Admiral Revel that at the recent Paris Conference there was in contemplation some attack other than air against Cattaro. So far as Cattaro is concerned, we are about to carry out an aerial attack against the submarine depot there, but we have not yet heard whether there has been any result.We had also considered the question, although perhaps we were trespassing on ground which was not ours, but naturally we considered matters in the Adriatic in the&apos; same way as he had no doubt the Allies considered the question of operations in Heligoland Bight, and there were a few points which he thought were worthy of consideration.The first was an aerial attack on certain chemical works which were used for the manufacture of explosives. We understood that there were no aircraft defences there, but he did not know whether the matter had already been considered.Another matter which we had in mind throughout the war was the seizure of one of the Austrian islands. Yesterday the Conference had discussed the possibility of the capture of Heligoland, which was rather a difficult operation. It is possible that some of the Austrian islands are not very powerfully defended. The object of the capture would be to cut through the communication between Cattaro and Pola.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI stated that, as regards the proposed attack on the chemical works, they could readily obtain information as to whether there were aircraft defences or not.As regards the second suggestion, this was a very big proposition; and when they began their war the first thing which was very deeply discussed was the capture of an island. There were many islands along the Dalmatian coast in inner channels which enabled ships to go from north to south without being seen from the high sea, and internal lines of communication were very important if they took possession of an island.As regards harassing the enemy bases, he thought we should continue to do that by aeroplane, both as regards shipping and military buildings. In three attacks they had dropped 21 tons of explosives (at night). Their aeroplanes carried very heavy bombs (150 kilog.) and had three engines.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then asked whether anyone had any remarks to make on the question of the Adriatic.^ VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI further stated that their torpedo-boats laid mines during the night in places where they thought the enemy ships would come out. [984] ^ &apos; ,     I
ADMIRAL JELLICOE asked whether the obstructions at the entrance to Pola were powerful, and whether they were on the surface.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI replied that they were below the surface of the water.ADMIRAL JELLICOE asked whether it was possible for shallow-draft boats to get over them.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that they had already attempted this.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then asked whether the submarine base was at Cattaro or Pola.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that the. German submarines no longer go to these two places because they enter the Mediterranean and then return to the North Sea. The Adriatic is left to the Austrians. This was according to the information they obtained from their various sources.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that, in regard to a barrage in the Straits of Gibraltar, the difficulty was that one end would be in territorial waters, and he did not think we could afford to interfere with the Spanish to that extent. The conditions in regard to current were somewhat similar to those in the Straits of Dover, where for three years we had tried to make an effective barrage and had not yet succeeded.CAPTAIN LEARMONTH stated that the Straits of Gibraltar were immensely difficult owing to the heavy seas ; also measures would have to be taken to ensure that the traffic was never held up, but could pass through uninterruptedly. That would mean the passing through of a great number of vessels.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON then stated that they had no information which led them to suppose that Cattaro had been abandoned by the German submarines, and even thinks it is there they get their supplies. Cattaro, therefore, is a centre, and is of considerable importance. This would be a reason for attacking it. We have every incentive to hamper the submarines in that area and make it unhealthy for them.The Italians have already made many successful attacks, and we ought to be able to make the place untenable by using all the means in our power.We have not very much time before us, and therefore if anything is to be done the operations should be considered now and undertaken before the bad weather. The Italian Government should decide whether this should be done, as they understand the conditions m that part of the world better than we do.To summarise, if we cannot do it now, we should undertake the necessary arrangements to do it in the spring.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said it would not be easy to destroy the base for submarines ; it was not so simple as it appears at first sight. Further operations must, also be kept to mind. It is useless to undertake operations without an object in view.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said he did not understand what military operations were possible along the Dalmatian coast in the winter.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI stated that some operations were possible. They had an army there and batteries in shore, and also coast batteries. Dui-azzo has been attacked very often by aircraft, and the conditions there are now very bad from the continuous explorations they make there by aeroplanes. A ship was sunk in port there.He feared he had said something not quite exact about German submarines in the Adriatic. German submarines have come from the North Sea and to the Mediterranean by Gibraltar, and use Pola and Cattaro more frequently Cattaro as a base.Item 9..ADMIRAL JELLICOE said it did not appear that we could usefully pursue the matter of the Adriatic, so perhaps it would be better to pass to the next question,
which was raised by Admiral Kedroff the assistance of the Allied Fleet in the White Sea against submarine attack.In regard to that, judging by the experience of the last year, he thought the German submarines would leave that neighbourhood towards the end of this month. He thought they left early in October last year ; our own submarines left, about the 10th October, and the enemy submarines had then already left.HEAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF said they had lost ships in October last year, either in September or the beginning of October.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then stated that perhaps it was in November that enemy submarines had left. He was not quite certain as to the month. We should leave our submarines there this year until the same date.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF said he would like to point out to the Conference that it was very important for them that they should keep this port quite free of enemy submarines. They depended very much upon this port, and they had now railway facilities there which would help them. He realised that the British had done very much to help them in sending ships and mine-sweepers there, but by this means they protected only the front of the White Sea, but the other part of the White Sea is not protected.He was afraid that this winter the Germans would not recall their submarines from the White Sea. They might recall them if they regarded it as unimportant, but they certainly might continue to keep them there.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then stated that he was reminded that there are four Russian destroyers and one submarine on the way to the White Sea now.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF said that they have just come from a very long journey.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then said that, from reports received from our own submarines, they were unable to work there when they first arrive owing to the cold. He did not think the German submarines would remain there throughout the winter.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF repeated that they had lost ships there last year in late autumn.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that he had asked for statistics showing comparative losses in the White Sea and the Mediterranean in regard to the volume of traffic. His recollection was that the losses in the White Sea were very much less as compared with the Mediterranean.Our policy of course had always been to send everything that we could possibly spare up to the White Sea. We added four trawlers about two months ago to the patrol vessels, ami the question has now been raised once more as to the traffic going up into Norwegian territorial waters, and from there convoyed after leaving Norwegian territorial waters. We had that question examined early in the year, and the conclusion reached was that the navigation in Norwegian territorial waters is so difficult that it was not possible to get any Captain to keep his ship there. In fact, a great many neutral ships at the beginning of last season were lost ships which were presumably trying to keep in territorial waters but were unable to do so. The only alternative is a system of convoy right throughout the whole passage from the British Isles to the White Sea. That question was examined two or three months ago, and it was found that it would require something like forty trawlers to keep the volume of traffic moving, and we have not got them.   They do not exist.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF stated that the most dangerous points were the entrance to the White Sea and the entrance in Kola Bay.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that no system of convoy would be of use up to the White Sea unless we had a cruiser. The convoy must be kept together. As we stated yesterday, we are now forty-one cruisers short.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDRO h F said he thought if the vessels were convoyed from Lerwick it might be possible to leave the vessels without convoy from the North Sea to the White Sea.ADMIRAL JELLICOE asked how many ships had been lost in the vicinity of Shetland Islands.
REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF said he thought the number was fourteen. About 10 per cent, of all their shipping in the White Sea this year.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said he thought it was about 11 per cent. The difficulty was that everything comes to us: We have to provide convoy for everybody in the world, and we have not got the vessels. We are asked to bring troops there. They arrive and they are sent back again.CAPTAIN DE SCHOULTZ asked whether the trawlers now available in the White Sea would still be available when the White Sea was closed.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said he thought they would be brought back to be repaired.   He assumed that the conditions this year would be the same as last year.CAPTAIN DE SCHOULTZ said the conditions from the German point of view were not the same. Last year there was little purpose, but this year there was. There was very small traffic last year ; this year, with the new railway, there is a good deal of traffic.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that our reports from Archangel in regard to the discharge of ships were very bad indeed.   The labour conditions were so bad.REAR-ADMIRAL KEDROFF stated that the labour condition was now quite good.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then stated that we would look into the question of what was proposed for this winter, and see what could be done to meet the Russian requirements.Item 10.The next question dealt with was the assistance to Italy by the United States of America in the direction of supplying material.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said he had a note with him of some materials which were expected from the United States, and which had already been ordered, but he would like to emphasise the delay which they had experienced in obtaining delivery, and he would like to ask Admiral Mayo if he could help to overcome the delays.Their main requirements were about 15,000 tons of steel, 50 motor-boats for use against submarines, and about 96 motors.ADMIRAL MAYO stated that he was not in a position to say anything definite with regard to the matter. The question was one for their Shipping Commission and the arrangements that were made. &apos; He would be quite Mulling to send word that the Italian representatives at this Conference were very interested in the delivery of the materials already ordered by Italy from the United States, and are anxious to get delivery.He could not say anything more, because the allotment of ships was something he did not know anything about. The desire of America was to do the best for each and every one of the Allies, but their establishment was not complete by any means. He fully expected that their Shipping Commission would take over all merchant shipping, and then his Government would probably handle the lot.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI asked whether they would be able to send some trawlers to help them in the Mediterranean.ADMIRAL MAYO replied that trawlers were very scarce indeed. They were sending some across to France now, which were alread)^ on the way.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI then asked whether it would he possible to help them in regard to destroyers. If they could get assistance they would be able to allocate some of their destroyers of a less-recent type for escorting.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that we had not yet been informed as to the allocation of destroyers. Undoubtedly if the situation admits of it, and the United States destroyers are sent to work in the Atlantic or in British waters, it would probably be possible to help. One of the first things they would do would certainly be to leinforce the Mediterranean. He did not know to what extent the United States were prepared to go into the Mediterranean for fear of meeting Austrian submarines instead of Germans.
VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI replied that it was absolutely direct. [984]KADMIRAL MAYO said with regard to the destroyers that was a question which should be taken up direct. He was certainly not empowered to say what the policy would be.Item 8.ADMIRAL JELLICOE then said the Conference had perhaps better pass to the report of the Committee, which has been considering the establishment of a convoy system in the Mediterranean, and which had now been handed in.The Committee has made several recommendations as to the convoys that should be instituted and escorts required. The. total number of escort units, required was 27. which means 297 vessels, assuming that an escort unit of 11 vessels, 8 always being-available.REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF said this is assuming so many were required for each convoy. The Committee had also provided for a minimum of 6 vessels, which would reduce the total to 240 vessels. The size of the escort will vary according to the number of ships in convoy.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said the total number understood to be available was 212. At any rate there was evidently a shortage, but the general conclusion of the Committee was that a system of convoy is desirable, but with short routes a convoy system of greater frequency is desirable in order to avoid undue loss of tonnage.Captain Lovatelli spoke in the report in relation to the route Gibraltar to Genoa. The escort forces were not sufficient. The Italian Chief of Staff said that the coastal route must in any case be maintained, a great measure of safety being secured by the coastal route. The Committee is of opinion that the minimum escort force to provide protection is 8.The Committee made the following reservations. They felt, as the British Commander-in-Chief is now considering the Mediterranean in detail, and as the Allies are furnishing him with particulars of the vessels they are prepared to allocate for the convoy service, the question should be left to him.vVe had a telegram from Admiral Calthorpe saying Admiral di Revel had stated that he would take about five weeks to prepare the list. That was sent about two weeks ago.The Committee thought that no useful purpose would be served by considering this point in detail, but they recognise the importance of a convoy system being instituted at the earliest possible date, and that an effort should be made to provide the necessary forces for this.The report concludes with the reservation that it is not intended to limit the powers of the officers of the Allied Navies now considering the matter at Malta.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that if no member of the Conference had anything to remark on the report of the Committee, he would suggest that it be adopted and included in the minutes of the Conference.REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF stated that he would like to say this about the Gibraltar-Genoa convoy. The Committee fully realised that if the local convoy is adhered to from Gibraltar to Genoa it would probably prohibit sufficient tonnage being-sent to Italy to supply the additional coal required. A ship may be as much as thirteen days between Gibraltar and Genoa., and it will very seriously affect the question of tonnage.ADMIRAL JELLICOE asked what is the estimated period for the direct route. REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : Four to six days.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that in spite of that the Italian Chief of Staff expresses the opinion that the coastal route should be assured.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that it was safer.ADMIRAL JELLICOE stated that it takes twice as long.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI said that very few ships were sunk by submarines on the coastal route.ADMIRAL JELLICO ii asked whether the direct route was absolutely direct, or whether it was diverted at all.
REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF said that it was not intended to keep on an exact line, but it would be a direct route in so far as it would not follow the indentations of the coast.ADMIRAL JELLICOE asked whether it was thought that the direct route, even with slight divergencies to avoid submarines, would occupy more than four daj^s.REAR-ADMIRAL DUFF : Say four to six days.ADMIRAL JELLICOE : And the coastal route takes thirteen days.VICE-ADMIRAL CUSANI: The longest takes thirteen days.VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON stated that the principal objection to the convoy system is the loss of time. Frequently ships were stopped on the way. Another kind of protection may be afforded to ships other than convoying, and that is sending them by coastal routes. In that way the ships may have the protection from the shore by aircraft and of the shore defences, which by taking the convoy the ship would not have.The main system of convoys in the Mediterranean has been considered only from the point of view of protection. It had also better be considered from the point of view of economy of shipping, and if the Committee which has been ajmointed at Malta to look into that question of convoys keeps in mind the necessity of economising shipping and time and the rotation of ships, then the system of protection they will decide will meet all requirements.The First Lord had stated yesterday that the losses in the Mediterranean had been larger than anywhere else, but it may have been so in the past, but has not been so in later months. The principal reasons why those losses were so large in the beginning of the war was that we were trying to stick to hard-and-fast rules instead of trying to give general ideas Convoys have oben been stopped on their way and sent into a port when no submarines were about when the ships could have been sent on without any clanger.In sending the finding of this Conference to Malta he would suggest that the Malta Committee should he left absolutely free to frame a system of protection, and not be bound to hard-and-fast rules.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said, in regard to the matter raised by Admiral de Bon about economy of shipping, it was perhaps as well to state that there is a representative of the Shipping Controller on the staff of the British Commander-in-Chief at Malta, and that representative should be very fully alive to the necessity of economy in tonnage, and he hoped that point would not be lost sight of at all.What Admiral de Bon wished, he gathered, was that in sending out to the British Commander-in-Chief the conclusions of the Conference they would like emphasis laid upon the fact that economy of shipping is considered a matter of prime importance, and that should be noted for the Conference.SIR ERIC GEDDES then suggested that, as the Conference had concluded the business (with the exception of the Committee which was to meet upon the question of Azores and submarine bases), it would be unnecessary for the Conference to meet again that afternoon.A shorthand note had been taken of the Conference, and would be circulated in the usual way. He would suggest, however, that rough draft general conclusions winch had been arrived at in the discussions should be prepared and that the Conference should meet again at 5 o&apos;clock on that day and agree the rough conclusions; the shorthand notes would then be circulated later on.This was agreed to.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said there was one other point, the question of the provision of cruisers to assist in convoy work which the representatives were asked to consider. He did not think that anybody was in a position to make any statement on the subject as to whether they considered there was any possibility of cruisers being provided, but if anybody was in-a position to make a statement it would be a great help.ADMIRAL MAYO said that, as was stated in regard to No. 1 on the Agenda yesterday, America would be willing to help in every possible way, but he would prefer any question in regard to cruisers for convoying to be deferred until later.
VICE-ADMIRAL DE BON said they had two cruisers which could be placed at the disposal of the Allies, but they were short of personnel. If the United States could send some battleships to replace their old ones in the Mediterranean, the French could transfer the personnel to some cruisers. Perhaps this was a matter which would be considered.The Conference then adjourned till 5 o&apos;clock on the same day to consider the draft Report and Conclusions.The Conference reassembled at 5 o&apos;clock, and SIR ERIC GEDDES asked whether everyone had read the draft Report and Conclusions; if so, he would suggest to take the Sub-Committee&apos;s report of this morning (Item 4) and see whether it is agreed to by the Conference. No one had any points to raise upon it, and it was therefore agreed.Sir Eric Geddes then suggested that the draft Report and Conclusions, which was merely a resume of the discussion, should be considered. Of course we had a shorthand note of what had been discussed wdiich would give more detail, but it was suggested that we now go through the draft Report and Conclusions item by item, and make any alterations as we go on.The draft Report and Conclusions was then considered seriatim and agreed as printed ante.SIR ERIC GEDDES then addressed the meeting as follows : The draft Report and Conclusions having been altered and agreed, this concludes the business of the Conference. I should like to thank you all on behalf of Admiral Mayo and ourselves for coming to attend this Conference, and for the help you have given us in the deliberations, and to tell you how great a pleasure it has been to meet you all. I feel that this, the first Conference I have attended as far as the Navy is concerned, has been a great help to me, and I hope the exchange of views will benefit all the Aliies. It is difficult to find time to come such long distances as from Italy and America, but I am confident that it is a very good thing for the Allies and for ourselves that we should meet and confer in this way.[984]L
APPENDIX I.Item 4.Report of Committee.The Committee appointed to consider the steps to be taken to counter enemy submarine cruiser warfare by the prevention of harbourage and other facilities for enemy submarine cruisers overseas, and by the development of a naval station at the Azores, recommends : :(1.) That the respective Admiralties and Ministries of Marine should communicate with their Colonial Ministers and ask for instructions to be given to their Colonies and Oversea Possessions to keep supervision over all harbours and anchorages to gain intelligence of German submarines or suspicious vessels.(2.) That steps be taken to ensure close co-operation between Allied Ministers in neutral countries to make.such representations as will ensure adequate steps being taken to prevent submarines or suspicious vessels being succoured or allowed to make use of territorial waters.(3.) That the following steps be taken as regards the Azores, the Portuguese Government being first asked permission : (i.) A United States naval force to be based in the Azores;(ii.) A British Intelligence Centre to be established in the Azores ; (hi.) British Directional W/T Stations to be established in the Azores ; fiv.) British Long Distance W/T Station to be established in the Azores for the war.(Any British units would work under the general directions of the United States Senior Naval Office)&apos;.)The French representative brought up the question of the difficulty of receiving W/T intelligence from vessels attacked by submarines in the South Atlantic, and more particularly off the coast of South America.It was agreed that the question of fitting ctrtain ships in convoys with powerful W/T to pass messages should receive consideration whenever convoys should be established.APPENDIX II.Item 6.Report of Committee.The Committee appointed to report upon the establishment of a convoy system in the Mediterranean reports :-The Committee, having taken into consideration the matters referred to them, were unanimously of opinion that a general system of convoy m the Mediterranean was desirable, and were s-ausfied that, on account of the short routes involved, a convoy system of greater frequency was required in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic in order to avoid undue loss of tonnage.They directed their attention specially to the following points : (1.) The routes  which  require  convoy, considering  each  route  in  order  of importance ;(2.) The escort force required for convoy purposes ;(3.) The number of ships which each of the Allies are prepared to provide for convoy purposes.With regard to point (1), the Committee felt it desirable that escorts should be so arranged that the trade will not be unduly delayed, and they considered that any great delay in port was to be deprecated.
They were of opinion that the following routes should be convoyed, the routes being indicated in order of importance : Gibraltar to Genoa. Gibraltar to Bizerta. Bizerta to Port Said. Marseilles to Bizerta. Marseilles to Algiers. Malta to Suda Bey. Port Said to Suda Bey. Naples to Bizerta. Malta to Taranto. Oran to Gibraltar.The above routes include only the main traffic lines, and the coastal traffic may well continue as at present.CAPTAIN LOVATELLI, speaking in relation to the route Gibraltar to Genoa, stated that, if the escort forces were not sufficient to provide escorts for both the direct and the coastal routes, the Italian Chief of Staff was strongly of opinion that the coastal route must in any case be maintained, experience having shown that a great measure of security for shipping was secured by the coastal route.The Committee considered that the route Suda Bay to Salonica was not a suitable route for convoy, and that it ought to be escorted and patrolled as at present.A statement indicating the Committee&apos;s views as to the frequency of convoys and the escort units required is appended to this report.With regard to point (2), the Committee were of opinion that the minimum escort force necessary to provide reasonable protection to a convoy of 12 ships and above was 6, an escort force of 8 being regarded as the desirable number. In convoys composed of from 4 to 12 ships, a minimum of 4 but preferably 6 escorting vessels is desirable.As regards point (3), the Committee felt that as the British Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean is now considering the Mediterranean convoy system in detail, and as the Allied Governments have furnishod him with, the particulars of the forces that they are able to appropriate to convoy service, no useful service would be served by the Committee considering this particular point in detail, but they fully recognise the importance of an efficient convoy system being instituted at the earliest possible date, and considered that every effort should be made to provide the necessary forces for this purpose.The Committee desire to conclude their report by a reservation to the effect that the views they have expressed are not intended to limit the powers of the officers of the Allied navies now considering the matter at Malta.Statement showing Committee&apos;s Recommendations of Convoys to be instituted, their Frequency, and Escort Units required.Route of -Convoy.Frequency.Escort Units.Gibraltar to Genoa and vice versaGibraltar to Port Said and vice versa via iiizertaMarseibes to Bizerta and vies versaMarseilles to Algiers and vice versaNaides to Bizerta and vice versaMalta to Taranto and vice versa...Malta to Suda and vice versaPort Said to Suda and vice versaOran to GibraltarTotal escort units  ...4 days4 2- :j4 ,; -49- j)4    ,, 26 8 2 2 I 1 3 2 2Note 1.
