I       I  j v V I 4 V.MILITARY CO-OPERATION  OF JAPAN IN  THE WAR.I UNDERTOOK to place before the Cabinet some of the considerations that might affect the decision whether it would be wise to invite the military co-operation of Japan, either now or in the future, in Mesopotamia or in some other theatre of war.I have not been able to collate all the various references that have been made to the possibility of military assistance by Japan since the commencement of the war.Broadly speaking, her contribution to the alliance up to date has been : (a.) In the combined attacks upon Tsingtau and Shantung ;(6.) In the seizure of the German Pacific islands north of the Equator ;(c.) In the co-operation of her fleet in the Pacific and Mediterranean ;(d.) In the supply of arms, munitions, and ships to one or other of the Allies.None of her soldiers have fought with any of the Allied armies. Nor, so far as i remember, has Japan made any definite offer of military assistance. When it has more than once been suggested that her armies might be invited to Russia or France, the suggestion has uot emanated from her in the first place, or received much encouragement at her hands. On one occasion, early in the war, when the opinion of the Government of India was sought on the desirability of inviting a Japanese force to Mesopotamia, Lord Hardinge replied that he would prefer to get back for Mesopotamia which campaign was then in its early stages an Indian Division that was guarding the Suez Canal, and to send a Japanese Division to take its place in Egypt, on the ground that the Japanese could claim a legitimate interest in the safety of the Canal as the great international highway to the Far East and to Japan itself. Nothing, however, came of the proposal. It has not since been revived. In November 1916 we learned from the present Foreign Minister of Japan that official opinion there was not in favour of military co-operation either m Russia or France.Let me say at once that there are certain theatres of war or possible war in which it would, in my opinion, be highly undesirable that Japanese troops should be employed. They are the following: (i.) The Indian frontier, or any region directly adjacent thereto. When the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was formed, the terms of the Treaty of 1905 provided explicitly for the employment of Japanese forces on the Indian frontiers, the only serious enemy by whom they were then believed to be threatened being Russia. The idea, therefore, of the co-operation of British, Indian, and Japanese forces against a common enemy in the Asiatic Continent is no novel one. But, even so, it was generally recognised that it was only in the last resort that the appeal would ever be made ; and Japanese military assistance, if sought or given, would almost certainly have been turned in another direction. The reason is that the appeal to an Asiatic ally to assist us in holding India would have been universally regarded in the East, and more particularly in India, as a proof that Great Britain could not do it herself, and that the day of the white man was over.(ii.) Any theatre of war, such as the Malay Peninsula, Persia, Afghanistan, Arabia (including Aden), Egypt, Palestine, and East Africa, where the appearance of the Japanese would be construed as an admission that we could not protect our own interests, and were obliged to rely upon another Asiatic Power. I place Egypt in this category (though not so confidently as the other areas named) because, although Egypt has geographically a quasi-international position, the assumption of the British Protectorate, with all the delicate problems that it involves, renders it very undesirable that we should appear [1028]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917.
oLito be unable either to defend Egypt or to solve the problems without the aid of an Asiatic ally. On the other hand, about Palestine there can be no shadow of doubt. To recover from the Turks the Holy City of the Christian faith by the aid of a non-Christian ally would be universally regarded as unseemly, if not shocking. The same objection does not apply to the employment of Indian troops by ourselves or of Senegalese troops bv the French in Palestine, because they fight in the armies of their over-lords as a natural consequence of their political status.(iii.) Russia. I need not now discuss the question whether the spectacle of Japanese armies marching to the rescue of the European Power upon whom they so recently inflicted a severe defeat would in any case have been desirable. It has now become impracticable for the reason that to lescue Russia by military aid is beyond the power of man, and that no Power would be &quot;less likely to undertake the impossible task than Japan herself.(iv.) Any other European theatre of war. Here, again, the question is one to a large extent of racial ascendancy and international prestige. I do not suppose that British or French troops would be unwilling to light alongside of Japanese troops, any more than they are of Portuguese, or Indians, or Annamites, or Pathans. But in Asia itself the impetus that would be given to Japanese ambitions and to racial jealousies between East and West would be enormous, and no one who knows Asia and is anxious to maintain European influence there would lightly run the risk.The above considerations, if accepted, would appear to confine the possibility of Japanese military assistance to a somewhat narrow sphere. It must apparently be an Asiatic sphere, and the points that have already been urged would seem to require that it shall be a theatre where Japanese intervention cannot be regarded as derogatory to the valour or capacity of European troops, where it can be satisfactorily represented as being directed against the common enemy of all the Allies (of whom Japan herself is one), and where it is invoked at a crowning moment of the conflict when the assistance of a Japanese army may have a decisive effect, not upon a subordinate campaign, but upon the capital issues of the war.I am inclined to think that Mesopotamia may answer the above description, and that the time may nome for us seriously to contemplate the desirability of inviting Japanese military co-operation there.Let me here say that Japan has, in my opinion, far from pulled her fair weight in the war. Her assistance, if not grudgingly given, has been, at any rate, narrowly restricted, and has been qualified at each stage by a most scrupulous regard for her own interests. Moreover, it has been more than amply repaid, for the promise of the reversion of the German possessions and rights in Shantung, and of the German islands in the Northern Pacific, which we have made to her, will place her in a position of great advantage at the end of the war, an advantage which will have been won by an infinitesimal sacrifice of money or men. Japanese policy towards China in the same period has been dictated by similarly selfish and calculating considerations, and has been similarly rewarded.Should the occasion therefore be deemed suitable, I conceive that there is a very good case for asking, and if necessary for pressing, Japan to play a much more vigorous military part in defeating the common enemy than has yet been proposed by her or considered by us. She might refuse. But such an answer would surely be detrimental to her own ambitions.Now what is the position, present and probable, in Mesopotamia ? I do not doubt that a most desperate and determined effort will be made by the Turks and Germans in combination to turn the British out of the Turkish territories in Asia. The main attack may be delivered in Palestine or against Baghdad; or an equal attack may be directed against both. There seems every reason to hope that either attempt or both attempts will fail. But they may also be renewed, and the recovery of Mesopotamia is so vital to the future of German plans of world hegemony and the destruction of the British Empire, that l cannot believe that discomfiture this autumn and winter will mean -an abandonment of the effort (if the war lasts as long) next spring. The Indian Commander-m-Chief clearly contemplates such a possibility, for he speaks of General Maude as &quot; certainly requiring reinforcements during1918,&quot; and he offers nine battalions, but cannot offer more, for the purpose. The situation may become even more acute if a simultaneous or corresponding attack of great magnitude is developed against the British forces in Palestine.
We Lave recently been discussing the ways in which such a situation might be faced (a.) By the reinforcement of General Allenby. (b.) By the reinforcement of General Maude, (c.) By a French landing at Ay as Bay.The question I raise is whether, if matters develop as I forecast, the solution might not be immensely facilitated and the final smash-up of the enemy in Asia rendered certain by the landing of a Japanese Army Corps at Basra early next year. I am assuming that it could be transported in Japanese ships, escorted by Japanese war vessels, and that the transport, supplies, and munitions would come direct from Japan. Mesopotamia is the only available theatre of war where these conditions would exist. It possesses the further advantage that its maritime approach is free from submarine attack.I am aware that objections may be raised to this proposal which are deserving of very serious consideration. I doubt if the)^ will come from any of our Allies. France, Italy, Russia (if she is still in the war), and America will probably say, &quot; If you like to get the Japanese to help you in smashing the Turk and defeating Falckenhayn, it is your concern rather than ours, and in so far as it will contribute to an Allied victory, it will be all to the good.   By all means go on.&quot;Nor do I imagine that the objections will come from our own military advisers. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has already suggested that we should employ Chinese troops (of very problematical military value) in Egypt or at Aden. He will hardly be likely to resent the use of so powerful a military ally as Japan in a secondary, though very important, theatre of war, where her appearance would relieve the drain upon the Western front and upon our resources elsewhere. His criticism is more likely to be that her aid is not necessary.The objections will more probably come from the India Office and the Govern-ment of India ; and the Secretary of State for India has already, in reply to a request from me, favoured rne with a general outline of the form which they might conceivably take.It may be said that Japan will not render military assistance without demanding her political quid pro quo in advance. I am not myself much impressed by this danger. It is true that most of the Allies, before entering the war, have made a statement of their claims, territorial or otherwise, and have sought to bind, or have bound, the other members of the alliance to an acceptance of thern by formal agreement. But Japan entered the war three years ago, and I am not aware of any case in which an Ally, merely because he has been asked to move his troops in this or in that direction, has demanded blackmail before consenting to the operation. I doubt if Japan would demand any terms at all as a preliminary condition. She might demand them at the Peace Conference or later on, and that possibility must be carefully considered. But I doubt her making them a condition at the start.It may be urged that if she is concerned in the defence of Mesopotamia she will demand commercial concessions, rights of settlement, &amp;c., there later on, which may be embarrassing to us. The answer to this is twofold : Mesopotamia has already been conquered and won by the valour of British and Indian forces alone. Japan, if she were to come in now, would have had no share in that undertaking. The future of Mesopotamian administration, if we win the war and are able to retain it, has already been determined in outline, and does not admit of Japanese intervention at this stage. If, however, her ambitions are commercial, what are the advantages which she could claim now or at the end of the war which we should not in any case be bound to concede to her ? Supposing that she desires after the war to run a subsidised line of steamers to Basra, could we stop her any more than we could stop her from running steamers to India itself? Supposing she demands a Japanese consul at Basra, could we in any case refuse her? Supposing she demands rights of settlement, will not that issue be governed by the municipal laws which we shall make in the Basra and Baghdad vilayets? Is the danger of Japan acquiring a powerful or menacing position in the Persian Gulf or Mesopotamia a serious one? Will not all her energies be concentrated for many years, possibly for generations to come, upon China and the countries lying between China and India, possibly including India itself (where she has been making since the wrar began most pertinacious efforts at commercial penetration).   Need we really be afraid of her in the Nearer East ?It is very likely that the Government of India, influenced by such alarms and by a latent resentment that India itself is not to obtain more of the spoils of Mesopotamia (if the latter be retained) may advise against the, suggestion that we are discussing.   The
question might be put in reply: &quot;Would you sooner lose Baghdad, or ensure its retention by the aid of Japanese troops ? &quot; To such a question I believe that there would be but one answer.Another Indian objection may be that even if Mesopotamia becomes an Arab State under a British Protectorate, still, both in Baghdad and Basra, which have been won for the most part by Indian arms, Indian interests have been created which in the long run will be predominant, and that no other Asiatic rival should be allowed to intrude upon an Indian preserve. My reply would be that I contemplate no such intrusion, and that the climate of Mesopotamia is not such as to encourage an active colonising policy on the part of Japan.   iShe has much better prospects elsewhere.A more formidable objection is the general consideration whether, by inviting Japan to join in the military defeat of the Central Powers, supposing them to be defeated, we might foment her ambitions or unduly aggrandise her position throughout the Asiatic continent. I am not myself much alarmed at this. When the European treaties with Japan were revised, and she obtained judicial and tariff autonomy, and when at a later date she defeated Russia, she became a great World Power, comparable with the Powers of the West. Nothing can deprive her of that position. Her co-operation in the present war has recognised and emphasised it. If she can help to search for and sink German ships with her fleet, and if her guns and shells have been employed to kill German and Austrian soldiers in Europe, is it a great aggravation of her claim that a Japanese army corps should be in at the death of one of the main enemies of the Alliance, an enemy who is being trained, armed, spurred on, and led by the arch-enemy, German)&apos; herself?I am aware that objections may be entertained to any undue or premature encouragement of Japanese pretensions by our Australian Dominions, who have their own reasons for disliking and even fearing the Japanese in the future. I hardly think, however, that these suspicions would be aroused in the present case ; for, firstly, no Australian troops have been or are likely to be employed in the Mesopotamian campaign ; and, secondly, there is not. nor is likely to be, any considerable Australian trade or connection with those countries in the future.To my mind the question is one to be decided in the last resort by military and not by political considerations. If the position in Mesopotamia cannot be rendered permanently secure with our own forces, if the European Allies cannot by themselves crush the Turk and destroy German ambitions in Baghdad, then I would not hesitate to invoke Japanese aid in the task.It is conceivable that the Turkish position, squeezed by the British, French, and Indian nippers on every quarter, might with the addition of Japanese pressure collapse in irretrievable ruin. And, moreover, it might not be a bad thing at the Peace Conference to have at least one Ally who would have a personal interest in seeing that we do not give back Mesopotamia in order to satisfy the aspirations of some unfortunate minor member or even major member of the Alliance.C. of K.October 3, 1917.printed at the tobeign ofticb by c. k. hareibow. 5/10/1917.
