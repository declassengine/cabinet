DOCUMENTIS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKHiO MAJESTY*S GOVERIMIMT).IT SECRET2812250.For the info rift at ion of the far Cabinet.Prom the First Sea Lord.FUTURE   NAVAL.   POLICY.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff baring putforward a paper, of to-day f.s date, on future military policy, it is desirable to consider the relationship between thefuture naval and military policy.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff argues thatthe concentration of our forces should take place in themain or Western theatre of war and that our armies shouldtake up &amp; defensive attitude in the Eastern theatre.This is unquestionably the policy which is bestsuited to naval and shipping Requirements.   Throughout thewar the main difficulty with which the lisvy has had tocontend has been that we have been given the task ofdefending a very much longer line of communications than ourresources have permitted, in spite of the great though limited additions tc our small craft flotillas which it hasbeen found possible to make.3, Since the early part of 1915, with the exception of anoccasional raider, the attack on our aea conanuni eat ions has been entirely carried out by submarines, and the onlymeans of protection against this? method of attack is bysmall craft, of which we have never possessed-anythingapproaching an adequate number.    Consequently our losseshave been severe.4. The fact that all our available small craft have beenrequired for the protection of our sea communications, both military and commercial, has so far made it extremely
difficult to epnre any   vessels of this nature for thepurpose of endeavouring to sink the enemy submarines before they gain open waters.5. There are only two methods by which enemy- submarinescan be prevented from reaching the high seas.The first is by the use of mines,  and the second by the useof small craft.   As regards the first, we unfortunatelyhave never possessed, until a month! ago, a mine which isreally satisfactory against submarines, and supplies of the new type are as yet coming in exceedingly slowly.   Asregards the second method, it is not possible by the use ofsmall craft to prevent enemy submarines leaving theirbases, and the only effective action that can be undertaken to intercept and destroy them before they gain open watersinvolves the use of an immense number of small craftin the North Sea and the English   Channel.   There are tworeasons for this; first, that submarines can travel forabout 100 miles under water and can rem&amp;in under water forat least 40 hours, end, secondly,  that within fen area ofabout 180 miles from Heligoland and in the Bast em part ofthe English Channel they can go to the bottom if they arepressed and remain there until the danger is past or untilnight falls.6. Having stated the difficulties with which the Kavy has been faced hitherto, I will now touch upon the future policy which it is intended to pursue against enemy submarines,7. This? policy - which has been rendered possible by, the entry of the United States into the war -and the consequent as si stance in the provision of small craft and the production of mines given by that country - is to establish a barrier of mines right across the Korth Sea in order to close the Northern exit.   At the same time it is
this policy is that which suits also the military policy as expressed by the Chief or the Imperial General Staff, namely, to concentrate our military efforts on the Western Front and to set on the defensive in the East, because our lines of communication under these conditions are shortened bo far as is possible.12. Such a policy might also admit of our lending toour allies France and Italy the assistance in the direction of the provision of moh essentials as coal and wheat as will enable them to tide ever the Winter.   In the case of Italy there appears to be some considerable danger that, failing Increased assistance from us, particularly in the direction of the supply of coal, the pacifist party may gain the upper hand.   All reports from Italy show that the situation is serious.13. There is the further and most important questionof affording assistance to the U. S * A. in the transport and escort of their troops to France and their maintenance when there.    it is obviously necessary to expedite the transport of the United states Army to the utmost possible extent, both from the point of view of the morals of France and that of tangible military help en the Western Front.14. Finally, the question of the tonnage necessary tokeep up our own essential imports is one of great importance..    The report of the Ministry of Food dated the 3rd October Indicates, on page 4, a position which cannot be deemed satisfactory,(Sgd).     J. ft. JELLICOE.9th October, 1917.
also intended to lay mines of a new and different type itiueh closer in to the German submarine bases, and, in addition, to lay a large number of mines in the Straits of Dover .S. Two patterns of our mines are involved, both of anew type, and in addition a large number of mines of American design and manufacture.     The total number involved is something approaching 200,000 and it is evident that time will be required to manufacture and lay the barriers.9. The British mines will commence to be deliveredin large numbers in about January of next year, and by May a sufficient number should have been delivered and laid to make very appreciable progress with the North Eea barrier. If American anticipations are fulfilled, the situation as regards the delivery end laying of American mines should enable very considerable progress to have been made also in their portion of the barrier, so that by the month of Kay there is every reason to hope that the barrier, although not by any means complete, -ill have begun to exercise a very considerable effect upon the movements of German submarines and very possibly to hsve been instrumental in the destruction of a fair number.    The mines which it is Intended to lay nearer the enemy bases should , if our anticipations are realised, be in position early in the Spring, and consequently by the early Summer of next year it may be hoped that the submarine menace will really be considerably more in hand .10. Under these conditions I venture to express to theCabinet my very strong views that our policy during the next eight months should be one which conserves to the utmost such shipping as remains to us, in order that we may tide over the difficult period before us.11. Unquestionably the best method of carrying out*
