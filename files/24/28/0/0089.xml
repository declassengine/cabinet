Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAS7/017.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary,. XVII* (13th October, 1917.)It is impossible to present the situation in Austria-Hungary as a connected v/hole, for the simple reason that the machine of State is showing ever increasing signs of disintegration.     Politicand stagnation.     $either government has any stable foundation; and each merely puts forward ambitious programmes in order to con-ceal its own instability.     Meanv/hile the Emperor and the Joint Foreign Minister Count Czernin are undoubtedly anxious for peace, and are not merely leaving the press very much greater liberty for the discussion of peace ideas, but are publicly professing their adhesion to the principles of international arbitration and general disarmament.     But there is as yet absolutely no indication of their desire to negotiate  -apart from their German ally, still less of their capacity to disentangle themselves even with the best will in the world.On 25th September the Austrian Parliament reopened, and the Premier, Dr. von Scidler, made his first appearance since the reconstruction of the Cabinet.     His speech y/as lengthy and un-inspired; all the stress was laid, not on political, but on social and economic questions.     Criticism upon it may be summed up in the words of the Zeit that it &quot;sums up what v/ill have to be done in Austria during the next ten years, but gives no clue as to v/hat the Government intends to do during the next ten weeks&quot;.     Hisally the main feature in both Austria and Hungary is desorientationI.AUSTRIA.
references to the much canvassed constitutional reform were also perfunctory.     In announcing that it would he carried through on the basis of the seventeen existing provinces, he ifrso facto con-demned the scheme to barrenness, since none of the various national questions of Austria, still less of Austria-Hungary as a whole, can be solved unless these provincial barriers are broken down. The speech betrays strong pressure from the Hungarian Government, which is both alarmed and furious at the Czech, Jugo-Slav and Ukrainian claims, as put forward in the Austrian Parliament. Seidler solemnly committed his Government as &quot;adhering irrevocably to the Dual System&quot;.     This is a plain enough answer to all who set their hopes upon the federalisation of Austria-Hungary.A German Regine.     Interesting confirmation that the Austrian Government has abandoned all idea of satisfying Slav demands, comes from Dr. Denk, the leader of one of the German parties in the Reichsrat.     He announces that he and his colleagues, in a three hours&apos; interview with Seidler, &quot;won the hope that a course   will now be followed which is Austrian, and in this case Austrian is identical with German&quot;.The German National Union (which includes every German parliamentary party except the Socialists) has issued proclamations &quot;To the Germans of Austria&quot;, declaring that they will accept no reform which could possibly endanger the national position of the Germans, and that they insist upon the maintenance of the Dual System.     (Incidentally they denounced the Stockholm Conference as &quot;obviously under Entente influence&quot;, and rejected &quot;a renuncaitory peace&quot;).Slav Peeling.     Meanwhile the Slavs are organising themselves further.

While all the Czech parties adhere to the Czech Parliamentary Club, three of these have now actually coalesced under the leadership of Eramar&apos; and Klofac, the two condemned chiefs. Another amnestied leader, whose doctorate at Prague University had
taken from him on condemnation, was again promoted doctor amidhe acclamations of an enormous crowd.     T^e strength of feelingamong the Czechs i3 best illustrated by the parliamentary speechof lather Zahradrik, a Catholic priest and a Praemonstratensian.He openly criticised the Pope for not mentioning the Czechs, butdeclared that they would survive this and have one person less tobe grateful to.&apos;     He added that Bohemia^ claims cannot be settledat Vienna, but only at the future Peace Congress.     This speech hascaused great scandal in German Catholic circles in Vienna.There have been scenes of a most violent and uproariouscharacter between Germans and Czechs in the Austrian Parliament -one oforiginating from an attempt of/the amnestied deputies to take his seat in the House.     A German Bohemian deputy warned the Premier that in Bohemia &quot;a silent revolution was in process&quot;, With the scarcely veiled purpose of weakening the jfiimpire at home and abroad.     In certain Czech districts, he alleged, there was abundance of food, while the German districts of Bohemia were being allowed to starve by a local policy of collusion.The Lack of a Majority.   To sum up, the position of the Seidler Cabinet is far from secure.     The Budget Committee passed by an almost two-thirds majority - only the Germans v/oting against it -a vote of disapproval against the Committee for the Control of the Public Debt, on the ground that they had acted unconstitutionally. The Cabinet at once met, and sat for five hours till after midnignt. It seems quite clear that the vote was influenced by national and political rather than financial reasons.     The Slav bloc is slowly trying to assert itself, and it is quite doubtful whether the government will secure a majority for the Budget.The Economic Situation grows more serious every day, and the press no longer makes any effort to conceal its gravity.     (l) It is now admitted on all sides that the Clothes Cards have been introduced too late to be of any real use.     Clothes can now only
he obtained in return for a written official order, stating that the bearer is in urgent need of the particular article.     Stocks of clothing appear to be almost entirely exhausted, and probably even the troops cannot be well provided for.     Shoe leather is also running very short-     A special enquiry in Budapest published on 3rd September revealed the fact that the average price of a pair of boots is  10 instead of  2. 2. 0.. a shirt 25/- to 30/-, stocking 16/- to  1, a handkerchief 3/6 to 5/-, gloves 14/- to 20/-.     Sub-stitutes for tobacco are being discussed at some length in the press.     (2) Elaborate official orders have been published for the restriction of all heating and lighting materials.     Distribution is more and more difficult-     Dr. Wekerle publicly admitted in Parliament that Hungary&apos;s supply of coal &quot;cannot be materially in-creased&quot;, and that the import of coal from Austria and Germany &quot;is subject to almost insuperable difficulties&quot;.     This clearly refers to the growing difficulties of transport and rolling stock.     Even inside Austria itself transport problems are acute; for instance late in September a group of five Bohemian towns on one of the main lines from Berlin to Vienna had to close their electric installation owing to lack of coal.     (3) The Queue system has reached such lengths-in Vienna that women and-children have to begin to form up at 3 a.m., or even midnight, in order to get the most necessary household supplies late next day.     The press is full of accounts of the terrible effect on health and on the morals of uchool children. Horseflesh is described in the Zeit as now being food for the middle classes.In the two months preceding 15th September there were nearly 1,100 cases of epidemic dysentery in Vienna, and 418 deaths.     As over half were persons of over 60, it is clear that privations are affecting the older portions of the population.
The new Hungarian Premier, Dr. Wekorle, in presenting himself to Parliament, made a very important statement of policy, which deserves attention for two main reasons.      (a) As showing how little prospect there is of winning over the governing class in Hungary to a policy of federal reconstruction such as the Emperor Charles is suppoedd to advocate.     (b) As illustrating the outlook of a man who is certainly one of the ablest statesmen in Europe -especially in economic questions and with whom our own statesmen will very probably have to sit at the same table when the time for peace negotiations eventually comes.Hifcs attitude to Electoral Reform, which for ten years pasthas been the key to the political situation in Austria-Hungary,iB already slightly equivocal.     He declares his Government tostand or fall by it, but the stress which he lays on &quot;guaranteescf our (i.e. Magyar) national existence&quot; shows that an attempt willbe made to correct the principle of universal suffrage to the dis-advantage of the non-Magyar population.     That this is no merebyconjecture is shown/still more recent pronouncements of Mr. Vazsonyi, the most advanced advocate of electoral reform in the present Hungarian Cabinet, and the minister in whose hands the drafting of the bill has been left.     Mr. Vazsonyi declared most emphatically that his reform &quot;will not merely not undermine, but will positively reinforce the political predominance of the Magyars in Hungary&quot;. Ke actually declared his intention of dividing Transylvania, which is regarded as the stronghold of the Rumanians, &quot;into 64 constituen-cies, in such a way that the Rumanians will not command a majority of the electors in more than four of them&quot;.      What is known as &quot;electoral geometry&quot; has been reduced to a fine art.in Hungary: but if Mr. V^zxonyi is able to produce such a result, he will un-^uestionably have far eclipsed all previous records.     It is clear
that if the only really, democratic member of the Cabinet can talk like this there is no hope of a genuine solution of the question upon which Hungary&apos;s whole future depends.     It is of course the very fact that it is so fundamental a question, which explains the tremendous and prolonged resistance of the ruling oligarchy.Hungary&apos;s Economic Policy.     Dr. Wekerie announced the con-tinuance of the economic negotiations with Austria and Germany, but stated that the government desired to reserve the final decision in such matters &quot;to the future Parliament&quot;.     This is no doubt in part a concession to the standpoint of Count Apponyi and the Independence Party, whioh forms so important a section of the government.     But it may also be interpreted as part of a deliberate design for postponing as long as possible any definite economic commitments on the part of Hungary.     It is however hot yet altogether obvious whether this represents an abandonment of the Tisza scheme of a twenty years&apos; Ausglelch with Austria, to be followed by a commercial arrangement with Germany, or whether it is intended to strengthen the hands of the Hungarian negotiators during the final period of bargaining which is now approaching. The latter supposition would seem to be confirmed (l) by the fact that Count Tisza in his answering speech left Dr. Wekerle&apos;s economic remarks unchallenged, and (2) by the fatft that four days later (18th September) the economic negotiations were resumed in Budapest under the late Finance Minister, Dr. Gratz, as Chairman, with tv/enty delegates from Germany.     There is always the possibiiity that an economic arrangement between Budapest, Vienna and Berlin may be arrived at, but kept strictly secret till after the war, in the hope of deluding the Entente representatives at the peace conference into the belief that Hungary, or Austria as the case may be, still retains a comparatively free hand economically and might therefore be open to advantageous economic offers, if treated with due political leniency.
Hungary against Federalism.   The Premier&apos;s references to national and constitutional questions were very remarkable and outspoken.     He denounced the claims of national unity put forward in the Austrian Parliament by the Czech and Southern Slav deputies and declared that they had no support either from the Crown or from Austrian governmental circles.     He added that nn taking office he had obtained His Majesty&apos;s &quot;express assurance4&apos;   that the introduction of national autonomy in Austria would have no influence, direct or indirect, upon the integrity of Hungarian territory - in other., words that the idea of forming single units out of the Czechoslovaks or the Southern Slavs of the Monarchy has been abandoned in high places.    Further details in Dr. Vekerle&apos;s speech foreshadowed his Austrian colleague^ public repudiation, a week later, of any designs against the existing Dual System. In face of such explicit and official assurances, the only other possibility is that some project is being secretly prepared behind the backs of the responsible ministers.During the debate Count Tisza, with the tacit approval of the Premier, protested energetically against the fact that men whose national programme involved the cession of Hungarian territory should have been invited to become members of the Austrian Cabinet. This is a pointed reference to the invitation given by Dr. von Seidler to Pather Koro ec, who as leader of the Jugo-Slavs in the Reichsrat, had put forward the programme of the unity of all Southern Slav lands.     Tisza claimed that every supporter of the dynasty and of &quot;the Magyar national State&quot; is bound to oppose such claims, and denounced the apparent desire of certain Austrian politicians &quot;to secure the direct support of the Entente Powers&quot; in regulating internal Austrian affairs.     As for the Czech claim to the Slovak counties of Hungary, said Tisza, &quot;let them come -and fetch them&quot;.
The Dalmatian Question.     The pronouncements of the Austrian and Hungarian Premiers are completely at variance on one important point.    Dr. Welterle formally associated his Government with Croatia1 s ancient constitutional claim to Dalmatia, and so earned the thanks of the Magyarophil Croat deputy, Count Pejacevic.     This means that Hungary&apos;s plan for solving the Jugo-Slav Question is the union of Dalmatia (and later on, of Bosnia) with Croatia under the Hungarian Crown.     Dr. von Seidler declaredw.with equal emphasis that his Government regards Dalmatia as Man integral part&quot; of Austria.    There is thUB a deadlock: and no solution of any kind is possible unless one or other gives way.Southern Slav Policy.   Meanwhile the present attitude of the Southern Slavs is extremely interesting.     The Southern Slav leaders have marked out the political field into three divisions, and each section of political opinion has &quot;been assigned its own special part.     (l)   In Croatia, where the Magyars have it in their power at any moment to restore the dictatorship and terrorism of men like Rauch and Cuvaj, the Serbo-Croat Coalition has accepted office on the basis of the existing arrangements between Hungary and Croatia, and is thus able to fill various high offices with reliable and colourless Croat patriots instead of the creatures of Budapest, and has received a free hand to prepare internal reforms, in return for absolute passivity in foreign questions.     (2) The Southern Slavs of Austria, meanwhile, now led by the Slovenes of Laibach, have a much freer hand, and are working openly for the programme of Jugo-Slav Unity enounced by their leaders in the Austrian Parliament on 30 May.    They are linking up with all the Opposition parties in Croatia and Bosnia and holding conferences for concerted action.     The presence among them of such brilliant men as Smodlaka and Cingrija, who were in prison camps till the summer amnesty, shows that clericals and anti-clericals are working
lecomplete harmony.     Their programme is complete Unity in an in-endent State-unit and is therefore absolutely incompatible with Dual System: but they save themselves by always adding the ause &quot;under the Habsburg Crown&quot;.      (3) Meanwhile their kinsmen exile, as represented by Trumbic and the Jugo-Slav Committee, e working on the basis of independence in union with Serbia, d the Pact of Corfu is the fruit of their three years of work, thus acting, they have the secret approval of both the Other iro groups.     This has been conveyed to them in indirect Ways, iough of course there can be no breath of this in public.     But here is evidence in the fact that as in the case of their previous ifestoes, so ribw in the case of the all-important Pact of Corfu, ot a single party or individual among the Jugoslavs of Austria-angary has been found to repudiate their action.Magyarisation through the Churches.     Further   flagrant proofs f the reactionary outlook of the Wekerle Cabinet in racial matters re afforded by the action of Count Apponyi, the Minister of dueation, in imposing restrictions upon the Roumanian teachers* raining colleges in Transylvania, owing to their attitude during he Roumanian invasion last year.     Count Tisza urged the Government o extend its restrictions to the seminaries for Roumanian priests, nd to take advantage of the suspension of the constitution of the ierbain Orthodox Church (in Hungary and Croatia) and the vacancy in :he office of Patriarch, in order to enforce Magyar control there Iso.     Till the war the one direction in which the Roumanians of Angary had been left undisturbed, was in the matter of Church utonomy: now there is to be an open.attempt to Magyarise the Serbian and Roumanian Churches.It is to be remembered that while the Emperor of Austria has V his personal action imposed a political amnesty in Austria (from rtiich no less than 18,000 persons benefited), he has not been able to do the same as King of Hungary, owing to the intolerant attitude
of the Magyar government.     Thus, as a Roumanian deputy complained in Parliament, the prisons of Hungary are still crowded with non- . Magyar victims.The position of the Wekerle Cabinet has not been strengthened by the publication of very grave and scandalous charges directed in the public press of Budapest against two prominent members of the Cabinet.Austrian Comment on Mr. Asiiuith.     Mr. Asquith*s Leeds speech has been received by the leading Austrian papers with a howl of rage.    The Heue Preie Fresse, which only a few weeks earlier was contrasting Mr. Asquii;h&apos;s moderation with the violence of the &quot;War-agitator Lloyd George&quot;, now showers open abuse upon the former as &quot;a political cardsharper&quot;, &quot;a sly tactician&quot;, guilty of &quot;lawyers1 tricks&quot;, &quot;repellant cruelty&quot; etc..     A special article is devoted by the paper&apos;s well-known military critic Pabius to denouncing Hr. Asquith&apos;s reference to our victory in Flanders as a gross misuse of the English peopled confidence.     The Daily Hews   is quoted as &quot;scourging the braggart prophecies of the English generalissimo&quot;, and the Viennese public is assured that the whole British offensive has been an utter fiasco.The comments of the leading clerical organ Reichspost may be judged from two phrases: &quot;Even in &apos;canting&apos; England there will probably be laughter over Asquith&apos;s competition with &quot;Wilson&apos; s &apos;oily&apos; Quaker sermons,&quot; and &quot;the British Empire came into existence through a whole series of similar &apos;crimes&apos; to that of 1871 in .I!Alsace.7-     i r
