SECRET.,General Headquarters,British Army in the Field. 8th October, 1917.The Chief of theImperial General Staff.On the occasion of the Prime Minister&apos;s recent visit to my Headquarters he requested me, as you are aware, to submit my views as to the role of the British forces in the event of Russia being unable to maintain an active part in the war, and having regard to the weakened state of France and Italy.In accordance with that request I now beg to submit the following summary of my opinions:-The number of considerations affecting a decision on the problem is so great that it is impossible to deal with them in a short paper. For this reason I will deal here with the ruling factors only.   I have, however, in forming my opinions, given careful thought also to many fther considerations which have to be taken into account, and if there should be any special points on which the Prime Minister desires a statement of my views I shall be glad to furnish it.The first factor to be taken into account is that not only Germany but her allies rely primarily and practically entirely on the invincibility of the German armies to secure for them favourable terms of peace.It is evident to the whole world that it Is belief in Germany1s military strength, hope of eventual safety basedthereon,
0 E ^2. ^ *thereon, and fear of incurring her resentment, which hold her allies in the field; and that if the power of resistance of the German armies were once &quot;broken down completely, or even manifestly on the point of breaking down, Germany and her allies would gladly accept such terms of peace as the allies might offer.The first question to he answered, therefore, is are we justified, under the conditions postulated by the prime Minister, in basing our plans on a belief in the feasibility of overcoming the resistance of .the German armies by direct attack before the endurance of the British Empire, and its allies remaining in the field, breaks down?If the answer to that question is in the affirmative our course is clear.     If it be in the negative, the next question is - what better course is open to us and our allies?I will deal, briefly, with the second question first.The various alternative courses open to us are well known.     They have frequently been examined and I have very carefully considered them.     There is no one of them which offers any prospect of defeating the German armies, and until we defeat those armies I can see no prospect of gaining the peace we seek.   By great efforts, great expense, a much increased strain on our navy, and a considerable expenditure of time,  some of the various plans which have been proposed would offer a fair prospect of gaining some success against the Turks or possibly against the Austrians; but, since every addition to our strength in the East entails a corresponding weakening of our efforts in the West, it would be well within Germany7 s po?fer, especially under the conditions laid down by the Prime Minister for the examination of the problem, to prevent the success being more than local.     She would be bound to exercise that power if our success threatened to have serious consequences for her, and if it did not ourefforts
Westernefforts would manifestly have been made in vain.       Moreover, we should run great risks in making the endeavour.       With Russia giving little or no help, the German forces on the Western front Increased in consequence, France and Italy weakened, and part of the British forces in France diverted to distant -theatres, my armies might bo reduced tc the defensive.       We have therefore to consider the effect on our allies (including America), on the peoples of tho British Empire, on public opinion throughout the world and not least in the East, and on the enemy-, of a cessation of offensive operations in the Western theatre;   for it is certain that, at any rate under the conditions postulated, neither France nor Italy will carry on an offensive if we are unable to do so., and America will not be capable of achieving any important results alone by offensive action next year.In my conviction those reasons alone, and there are others, are sufficient to show beyond any reasonable doubt that it would be not only unsound but highly dangerous to undertake any of the various indirect means which have been suggested to sap Germany&apos;s power by operating against her allies.       There are conditions under which such indirect action is wise and offers the best chance of success in war; but those conditions do not obtain for us in this war, and it is my firm belief that if wo adopt such indirect methods wc shall not only reap no benefit but will run a serious risk of tho enemy outstaying the allies in endurance as he is trying to do..I am therefore of opinion that success on the Western front is tho only real alternative to an unsatisfactory peace.       Tho question for decision, therefore, is whether tho allies are capable of overcoming the Germans on the
4.259Western front even though Russia should be unable to take an active part in the war next year.The present situation on this front, and the possible developments in it during the next few weeks, affect the problem considerably.     So far the enemy has brought but few divisions from Russia to this side, and those he has brought have in most cases been replaced by divisions exhausted in the fighting here.     Evidently, therefore, he does not expect any immediate total collapse in Russia, and in the time available for further operations here this year he can do little to affect the situation by transferring troops.It is also noticeable that, despite the comparative inactivity of the French, the enemy has so far shown that he does not consider it safe to weaken himself to any considerable extent in front of them, and, as they intend to attack soon, this condition may be expected to continue.At the present moment there are 147 German divisions on this front of which 135 have been driven from their positions or withdrawn broken by their losses since the 1st April 1917 - many of them twice and some three times.   Wo less tiian 77 of these divisions have been thus overcome -several more than once - during this period by the British armies.    I quote this as a proof of what our armies are capable of,Our offensive in front of YPRES continues to make r-ood progress,.     The enemy is undoubtedly considerably shaken and the ground we have already gained gives us considerable advantages and renders us less dependent on weather in following up our success .  further.     Our troops are elated and confident; those on the enemy&apos;s side cannotbut be/depressed
depressed and we have good evidence of it.In these circumstances it is beyond question that our offensive must be pursued as long as possible. I have every hope of being able to continue it for several weeks still and of gaining results which will add very greatly to the enemy&apos;s losses in men and moral, and place us in a far better position to resume an offensive in the spring. Amongst other advantages, we shall end this year&apos;s campaign with practically all the observation points originally held by the enemy in our possession - a very important cunsideration.The considerable wastage imposed on the enemy by a continued offensive may be expected to leave at the end of the year but a small balance, if any, of the 500,000 men in the reserves he now has available, and he is likely to commence the new year with only some 500 - 600,000 reserves at his disposal, including the whole of the 1920 Class which, judging by experience of the 1918 Class, will be of low fighting value.   At the normal rate of wastage, therefore, since the 1921 Class will not be fit to take the field next year, the enemy&apos;s man-power will be running out next May or June at the latest. This is a factor of first rate importance, and no alleviation in this respect would be gained by a return of prisoners from Russia if the latter should make peace, since this would be far more than counterbalanced by the loss of the great numbers of Russian prisoners now available for labour in Germany. Under such conditions we should enter on next year&apos;s offensive on the Western front with excellent prospects of decisive success if we throw into the scale whole-heartedly the
the full weight of the Empirefs strength and if Russia can retain on her front even the number of German divisions now there.   Future developments in Russia are so uncertain that in considering our future plans we cannot ignore the possibil ity that she may be able to do at least so much.Under the conditions set by the Prime Minister, however, I must assume that Russia may fail us even to the extent of making a separate peace - although she would thereby forfeit all claim to any consideration from her present allies.The various possibilities arising out of a Russian collapse are too numerous and too complicated to be foreseen with any degree of certainty, but presumably Roumania would be unable to continue to fight and a considerable proportion of the forces of the Central Powers now on the Eastern front would be withdrawn for use elsewhere..The unsettled state of Russia, however, would entail several divisions being held by the enemy on her borders; and, as regards the probable effect of a Russian collapse on other theatres of war, the following are in my opinion the most reasonable assumptions.Austria would transfer to Italy sufficient reinforce-ments to throw the Italian armies on the defensive, but Italy should still be able to hold her ground unaided,    We cannot assist her without compromising the success of our own plans.Of the 91 German divisions now employed on the Russian, Danubian and Balkan fronts, only 32 are estimated as fit to take part in severe fighting on the Western front.   The remaining 59 would probably be fully employed in watching Russia and in maintaining German Influence over the armies of her allies as at present.   Being of low fighting value they would be none too strong for the purpose, and however much Germany ;aay desire to assist and encourage the Turks in operations towards Egypt and against Mesopotamia, if only inthe
the hope of weakening our forces in Franco, her power to give material help would ho small.Tho Gorman forces transferred to the Westorn front would In all probability bo limited to, at the most, the 32 more efficient divisions above mentioned, giving Germany a total of 179 divisions on this front.Against those divisions the allies In Franco andBelgium would have by the 1st April next -62 British divisions, if our forces in France remainas thoy are.100 French        &quot;       (according to present information), 12 American     &quot;       (        &quot; -  &quot; &quot; ),2 Portuguese &quot;Total 176 divisions, of which the 2 Portuguese and, until later in the year, probably 6 of the American divisions will bo capable of defence only.     At first sight such a force would appear to be insufficient to justify the hope of a successful offensive on this front next year, but there are many considerations in our favour to be taken into account.Nineteen of tho Gorman divisions now on this front arc of poor quality, only fit for defensive on quiot fronts, 135 of the remainder have already suffered heavy defeats this year and that number will bo increased in the next few weeks.     Of tho 179 Gorman divisions, therefore, tho   value of at least 154 (135 * 19) must bo written down considerably,Tho Gorman losses arc being replaced now in largo proportion by quite inferior material and the proportion of such material In the Gorman ranks will Increase rapidly In tho future, while., by May or June, the Gorman reserves will be exhausted.In actual numbers of men the Allied Infantry will bo stronger than the Gorman by about 30$ owing to the greaternumber
number of battalions in the British, American and Portuguese divisions and to the greater number of men in the battalions.In artillery, still more In munition supply, and in aircraft the allies will have a marked superiority and the poY/er of increasing that superiority very greatly.     In reserves of man-power the allies, including America, have a still greater superiority.The American forces in the field will be steadily growing in numbers and efficiency.     By April six of the American divisions should be capable of offensive action, and as the campaign proceeds this number will increase steadily.The 100 French divisions may be estimated as fully equal to an equivalent number of German divisions under the conditions explained above.For all these reasons, even if the German forces on this front are inoreased to the extent assumed, I am confident that the British Armies in France, assisted by the French and American Armies, will be quite capable of carrying through a sustained and successful offensive next year under certain conditions which I understand to be realisable.These conditions are as follows:-Not less than the 62 divisions now in France will be required and they should be brought up to full establishment as soon as possible, and at latest in time for the drafts to be fully trained with their divisions before the offensive begins,, which should be as early as possible in the spring.Further drafts to replace wastage in next yearTs offensive should be trained and sent to Franco in time to taxe their place in the ranks when required.At least the full establishment of guns, munitions, and aircraft as already asked for by me will be necessary.It
It is of great importance that every possible facility shall he afforded for training my troops during the winter; inifor sending as many officers and men as possible (subject to training and defence requirements) on leave between the cessation of this offensive and the commencement of the next.     The armies have undergone almost superhuman exertion and hardships during the last few months, and unless the demands made on them during the winter are reduced to a minimum they cannot be expected to respond fully to tho further heavy calls entailed by a renewal of the offensive next year.,     I urge this point very strongly and it entails resistance to any French demands on us to take over more line.     A refusal by us to do so will undoubtedly be both justifiable and wise.     Though the French cannot be expected tc admit it officially, we know that the state of their armies and of the reserve man-power behind the armies is such that neither the&apos;French Government nor the military authorities will venture to call on their troops for any further greet and sustained offensive effort, at any rate before it becomes evident that the enemy&apos;s strength has been definitely and finally broken.     Though they are staunch in defence and. will carry out useful local offensives against limited objectives the French armies would not respond to a call for more than that, and the authorities are well aware of It,     In these circumstances, since the British armies alone can be made capable of a great offensive effort it is beyond argument that everything should be done by our allies as well as ourselves to enable that effort to be made as strong as possible,  and for this as much training, leave and rest as possible is absolutely essential for our men.The French authorities will no doubt insist stronglyon
on an extension of our front, but the weight of argument is all against it and our troops are entitled to be protected against what is. really an unfair demand on them..   They are in a foreign country, the French are at home.     They get little leave and at long intervals, the French soldiers get 10 days leave every 4 months and their Government dare not refuse it.   Our men have borne more and accomplished more than the French this summer, and though France may plead, that the weight of the war has fallen on her it cannot be expected that the British soldiers in the field who have done so much and borne so much, and who have come voluntarily from the ends of the earth to fight in France, will be ccntcnt to see preferential treatment given to our allies,.  This aspect of the case must not be overlooked any more than the purely military arguments, and it is on popular feeling amongst the French people rather than on military argument that the French demand on us to take over more line is based.The actual extent of front measured by miles Is no test of what we should hold.   The true test la the relative number of enemy divisions engaged, by us and still more the role to be allotted to us in next yearrs campaign..For all. these reasons it is necessary in my opinion to refuse to take over more line and to adhere resolutely to that refusal, even to the point of answering threats by threat s&apos; if no ce ssaryOne more indispensable condition of decisive success on the &quot;aestern front is that the &quot;.7ar Cabinet should have a firm faith in its possibility and resolve finally and unreservedly to concentrate our resources on seeking-it, and to do so at once... To gain decisive success,, especially under the conditions postulated by the Prime Minister,., wehave
/hi0 p0 0have need of every man, gun and aeroplane.that can be/provided, and of taking their training in hand as early as possible this winter.     To ensure this wo must take risks elsewhere and cut dovm our commitments in all other theatres to the minimum necessary to protect really vital Interests.   This principle applies equally to our dealings with our allies.     We cannot afford to assist them directly, and it is not in their own interests that the efforts of the only really effective offensive army which will exist next year in the alliance should throw away what is a good prospect and practically the only prospect of a real victory by disseminating its forces.      Victory against a strong and determined foe has never been won by such a course and never can be.     We must insist that our allies shall rely on themselves for defence, and the most effective assistance we can give them is by forcing Germany to use up her troops in guarding herself against our blows.I cannot in this paper go into the question of our requirements for defence of vital interests in the East, nor have I access to full information on the question.   But if a resolute offensive in France is adopted as our plan of campaign for next year, there can be no doubt that we should not hesitate to take risks as regards interests that are not really vital and that the measure of protection given to those which are vital should be carefully calculated on a scale which will just suffice for defence against any reasonably probable attack.       Great Britain has not the means to maintain more than one offensive.In this regard I venture to express the opinion that the leading men in the East have a truer conception of what is at stake in this war than they are sometimes credited with.In
In my belief they realise that it is primarily a straggle between the Anglo-deacon and. the German races and. idoals, and that the victor will be the predominant power in the Mahomedan world.     They will wait to ascertain which side is likely to be victorious before committing themselves cpenly, and they have quite sufficient intelligence to understand that the issue will be decided in the theatre where the main German forces are and must be employed.     If this were not so the comparative absence of excitement over the Turkish advance to the Suez Canal, our withdrawal from the -Dardanelles, and our misfortunes last year in Mesopotamia&apos; would seem very difficult to account for.On a previous page I stated that, in my view, the only roal alternative to an unsatisfactory peace is success on the Western front.For the reasons given above I am confident that if the measures I have advocated are adopted success on the Western front is within our power, even though Russia should collapse entirely and despite the weakened state of Prance and Italy.It is on the British forces, however, and on the moral and material strength of the British Empire that we must mainly rely for success, and, in case of differences of opinion as to the correct course to follow, we must insist oh occupying the predominant position in the Councils of the Allies to which our strength entitles us.     More than once already we have subordinated our judgment to that of our allios with highly unsatisfactory results.     We cannot afford to make such mistakes again, and whatever thoy may threaten our allios cannot afford to quarrel with us.In seoking success on the Western front we have in our favour not only the factors stated above but the additionalpossibility
possibility that Russia may prove capable of more than has been reckoned on, since the alternative for her is %t submit to a separate peace on Germany&apos;s terms, and to forfeit the friendship of her allies and the respect of the world.The alternative fcr us of accepting an unsatisfactory peace Instead of maintaining our offensive is still more impossible of acceptance,     It would mean not only the almost certain renewal cf the war hereafter at a time       Germany&apos;s choosing but the entire loss of the&apos; faith and respect of our Oversea Dominions, America, and our other allies, and indeed of the entire world, East and West.     More, it would entail a loss of self-respect from which Great Britain could never rec-over.     The effect on the 2,000,000 men in France, who have done so much and. suffered so much, and &quot;who are so confident of their power to win, would be calamitous and immediate..It would, be better for the future of our race to fail in next year&apos;s offensive than to- accept the enemy&quot;&apos;s terms now when after more than three years of splendid effoiet w* have brought the German resistance so near to breaking point.But I sec no reason to apprehend failure.     Everything goes to show that the power of endurance of Germany and her allies is so severely strained that the mere fact of our ability and evident determination to maintain the struggle to the end may suffice to turn the scale at any moment.Even if they hold out until next year and if our success in the field then is of a limited nature our enemies cannot possibly face a further prolongation of the war, with the full development of Americans strength, which will then -fce developing, to be reckoned with.In the present state of the German armies and of ours I am confident that if the course I have recommended be fiadopted whole-heartedly we shall gain far more than a limitedsuccess
9PLt ISsuccess in the field next year; and I urge unhesitatingly the continuance of the offensive on the Western front, with all our strength, as the correct role of the British forces even under the conditions laid down by the Prime Minister for this examination of the problem-.(Signed) E.Haig.Field-Marshal, Gommandi ng-i n-Ghi e f, British Armies in France.
