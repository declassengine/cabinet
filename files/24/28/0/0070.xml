Agricultural Executive Committees.     There are no matters of outstanding interest to report this week;   except that in Warwickshire the Committee have been authorised to take possession of 160 acres of land at Drayton adjoining the area of 300 acres of which they are already in possession.     In Essex the Committee are preparing a scheme for the cultivation of a farm near Saffron Walden in the possession of the Church Army. Determination of Tenancies.   During the week five Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 319 acres, and four Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 526 acres. Provision of Allotments.   Reports from 1,089 districts have now been received, showing that 199,229 applications were made for plots, and 180,299 plots have been provided under the Cultivation of&apos; Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).     The total area of the plots so provided is 13,262 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Allotment Programme for 1918.     Conferences have been held with various Societies interested in allotments with the objeot of securing their support to a programme for increasing the number and assisting in the organisation of.allotments.-1-
ft?The Department has prepared a draft programme to serve as a basis of discussion between the Department and the various Allotment Societies.Fruit Bottling.   Sixty-three demonstrations have been held during the week.     A noteworthy development of the demonstrations is the provision of a course of 4 or 5 days&apos; instruction in Manchester to be attended by 60 teachers of Domestic Economy^which teachers have charge of the instruction of 12,000 children in the Elementrry Schools.Spraying Potatoes,   Arrangements are being made for the organisation of Potato Spraying in 1918.     Conferences have been held between representatives of the Department and manufacturers of Knapsack Spraying Machines with the object of arranging for the manufacture of a standard Knapsack Sprayer to a specification drawn up by this Department.     The selling of these machines by the manufacturers at a fixed price has also been discussed, and the manufacture in advance of a considerable number of Knopsack Sprayers so that machines should be ready for sale in good time. Home Canners.   One hundred and forty Home Canners have been sold, and 92,000 cans.     Demonstrations have been held at these offices to show the rapidity with which quantities of fruit can be dealt with by the Home Canner.Pulping.      The Fruit Season in Kent Is now almost over.     The Sittingbourne Station has finished work.     The Maidstone Station is at present working on apples, and the Marden Station will close in a few days.     At the Newport Pulping Station 30 to 35 tons of damsons per day are being dealt with.     The Budeley and Pershore Stations are also fully occupied, and damsons are being pulped. The Cambridge Station is being used for the heavy damson crop in the
Buckingham District.     At Totnes nearly 200 tons of plums have been pulped.Drying Stations.     The work of erecting Drying Stations at Messrs. Meux&apos;c Brewery at Nine Elms is in progress.     Arrangements have been made with Messrs. Tomlinson Haas to increase their output of Drying Machines by an additional 6 dryers, to be delivered by the end of January.Blackberry Picking.   Bad weather has interfered seriously with the picking of blackberries by children in the Elementary Schools in connection with this Departments scheme for the supply of blackberries to the Army Jam Factories.     It has consequently been necessary to make arrangements for the picking to be carried cut in counties in addition to the six in which arrangements have already been made.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Grassland.   Questions having arisen cn the Devon Executive Committee as to the type of grass land which should be ploughed up In order to secure the full area of corn which represents the County&apos;s quota of the National task, a request was made that typical farms should be examined, and an opinion expressed by the Departments officers.     a large number of farms have accordingly been visited in different parts of the county.     The special value of each field visited in grass or under tillage was discussed with the local officers, and a decision come to as to the course to be adopted.     A communication is being sent to Lord Fortescue, Chairman of the Executive Committee, indicating the decision arrived at in each case.In the course of the inspection above referred to there was an opportunity of forming an opinion as to the general position in Devon.     The Northern and the Eastern Divisions of the county have now completed their preliminary survey.     The Northern Division requires 84;850 acres under corn in 1918;   up to September 30th, 74,983 acres had been promised, leaving a deficiency of 9,867 acres.     For the Eastern Division the respective figures
&amp; A ,4are 103,074 and 91,719 acres.     The balance required on about 186,000 acres is, therefore, 21,000 acres.A considerable number of farmers have not volunteered to break up lend, and the success of the programme depends on getting these men to do a reasonable share.     The Committee is being asked to make it clear that excuses will not be accepted unless there are good reasons for not breaking up.     It is believed that if this is done those who have volunteered will make a great effort to complete their tasks*Eradication of Leeds.   Experiments ore in progress to test the effect on weeds of waste substances such as nitre cake, sodium sulphate; etc., which might be utilised for spraying purposes in piece of copper sulphate and iron sulphate, supplies of which will probably become scarce.Plant Diseases.   The Biological Department of the Imperial College of Science and Technology has kindly offered to undertake any piece of entorological research likely to be of agricultural value at the.present time.     It has been suggested that in view of the serious damage incurred through attacks of wireworms, leather-jackets and other soil pests, the discovery of a more efficient soil insecticide than is at present known is of pressing importance. Vork on this problem has already begun.     Further work has been carried out in the preparation of suitable &quot;spraying calendars&quot; for the use of small fruit growers during next season.LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers made available to date for the 1918 Programme is 27,510 (10,508 so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 17,002 unskilled), and of these 22,050 (7,800 &quot;skilled&quot; and 14,250 unskilled) are now out on agricultural work.     Of the men remaining at the Depots, the majority of the so-called &quot;skilled&quot; men are being trained as horse ploughmen or as tractor drivers, and as regards the unskilled men these are largely unfit for farm work.     a large and
urgent demand exists for really skillploughmen^ which cannotbe met because very few are available among the soldiers releasedin Flanders is drawing to a close, a number of the skilled ploughmen who were withdrawn from the land this Spring could be again loaned by the Army on agricultural furlough for the winter months, they would be of enormous assistance in connection with the breaking up *f grass land.     10,000 such men could be absorbed during the next few weeks, and it is desired to submit this question for the special consideration of the war Cabinet.drivers to date is 785, of whom 692 have been placed for training under Tractor Representatives and 93 sent to the Departments Training Schools.     Of the latter 26 have been passed out as proficient and allocated to various counties.     In addition, 100 men have been supplied for work with steam.tackle; 18 of these being classed as skilled and the other 82 as having been sent for training Threshing.   A serious shortage of skilled engine drivers for threshing machines exists.     Examination of the soldiers becoming available at the Distribution Centres has resulted in the discovery of 35 men with experience of steam engines or threshing, and these have been sent out to Threshing Machine proprietors in addition to four men for training.     The Military Authorities have been asked to release 24 named soldiers who are skilled engine drivers for the 1918 programme, and to grant one month&apos;s agricultural furlough to 23 other named men.Horses.   Orders for the issue of 208 additional horses have been ee-nt orrt\.pkaring the- week.- making a total of 2,303 horses supplied to date.     About 200 of these horses have been hired out to farmers-without ploughmen.Prisoners of-War; -&apos;; Four additional agricultural prisoner- camps have been opened during the week)- bringing the number of such carps, up to a total of 37, comprising in all 3,101 prisoners.by the Military Authorities.If, now that the campaigning seasonThe number of men supplied for training as tractor
Applications have been sent to the War Office for additional prisoners amounting t^ 100 in all to be sent to certain of the existing camps.Women*s Branch. The number of women accounted for this week as members ef the Land Army is as follows:-In Instruction Centres ................... 868On Farm work............................. 5,507Waiting for references to be placedin Training Centres.............. 76Waiting for employment in Depots......... 55Waiting in their own homes ............... 1346,640The West Midlands (Test Meeting was held at Birmingham during the week, and in spite of very bad weather over 200 candidates entered for the various tests.     There was a large attendance of farmers^ tho were much impressed with the fact that so large a number of girls had turned out under such great dis-advantages.     The candidates reached a very high standard of efficiency., especially in milking, and many farmers have already applied for particulars of girls able to do similar work to those whom they saw at Birmingham.The following are instances which have been received this week of the useful work being done by women in assisting the production of food:-(a)    In South Wales a Group Leader has been rendering local farmers valuable assistance by organising part-time labour.     The farmers in this area, on account of the lack of accommodation, are able to make far greater use of village workers under the super-vision of a fore-woman than of imported members of the Land Army. The work done in this area by village women includes hoeing and singling of root crops, cutting thistles, hay-making, thatching, binding and cutting corn, threshing and the emitivation of derelist gardens.
(b) In North Wales, the river Conway suddenly over-flowed its banks and some women, National Service Volunteers, who were working five miles away, went over on Saturday afternoon and were working in the water lifting the sheaves. They saved the farmer&apos;s crop, and their work has stimulated the demand for women workers in the district.(c) In Westmorland the women engaged in picking the damson crop have been a great sucOess, and an unexpected development arose when the growers approached the Department&apos;s local women officers with regard to the selling of the surplus fruit.   The Westmorland women&apos;s Committee succeeded in disposing of 100 tons, which action has given the greatest satisfaction to the Damson Growers&apos; Association, and will go further than anything that has yet transpired to remove the prejudice of the Westmorland farmers to woman labour.Women&apos;s institutes. It has been decided that the work of the1  ni - - i iSub-Committee of the Agricultural Organisation Society, which has hitherto dealt with Women&apos;s Institutes, should now be undertaken by the Women&apos;s Branch of this Department, and the arrangements for the transfer are now complete.   Lady Denman is to be appointed Assistant-Director in the Women&apos;s Branch and will take charge of the Section dealing with Women&apos;s Institutes, and the services of Mrs. Nugent Harris, who has been Secretary of this special Sub-Committee of the Agricultural Organisation Society have also been secured..   It is hoped that by the co-operation of the County Committees and the Board&apos;s officers a great expansion of the work may be brought about.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION. Motor Tractors.    The following statement shows the position
respecting the receipt of tractors:-Consigned to Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees as shown in last Report ....     1,420Consigned during the week................ 15On offer to Committees ................... 108On offer to Ireland................. 6Consigned to Scotland (92) and Ireland (14) 106Not yet received hut available forforward allocation..................     ___1651,818Steam Tackle - As the season during which steam tackle can be used is drawing to an end, it may be convenient to give a brief account of the efforts whioh the Department has made since its formation to increase the output of work done by what is generally recognised as the most efficient ploughing and cultivating instrument used in this country.At the beginning of the year, it was found as a result of enquiries that almost one half of the 500 sets of steam tackle in England and Wales were not being used, through the inability of their owners either to secure efficient labour or to obtain necessary repairs.   Applications were made to the War Office for the release of some hundreds of named men who had had experience in steam tackle work, and nearly 300 such men were released by the Military Authorities for this purpose, Arrangements were also made for the repair of broken-down sets, with the result that by the beginning of the summer, the whole of the 500 sets, with the exception of about 40 which were obsolete, were actually at work.In view of the inevitable delay which must occur before new sets of steam tackle could be manufactured, the Department considered it desirable to adopt every means in their power to increase the output of work of the existing sets. They, therefore,
appealed to steam tackle owners to keep their sets at work 7 days a week from daylight to dark.     It must be remembered that sets are constantly at work 20 or 30 miles away from their base, and when they are idle on Sunday the men usually stop work at noon on Saturday, and the sets are not active again until late on Monday morning,     The Departments appeal to owners to work 7 days a week has been very generally responded to, with the result that many owners have, by. this means alone, increased the number of working hours by nearly two-fifths.     In many cases they have taken on an additional man. for each set, and have thus been able to grant each of their workmen one day&apos;s. leave a week without bringing the set to a standstill.Departments efforts, but the returns received week by week of the work done by each set in the country, show a decided levelling up, I.e. the work done by sets which previously were not fullyemployed, is now becoming more comparable 4^ the most efficiently managed sets,     The following comparison between the first return^ received by this Department and the most recent returns is striking:-19th March to 14thJuly (17 weeks). 463,166  . 27,245.2nd September to6th October (5 weeks) 224,063 44,813.It will be seen that, in spite of the fret that the second period consists of shorter days, the amount of work done has increased by nearly 65$.The term &quot;menS acres&quot; is employed for purposes of comparison each acre ploughed counts as two, each acre cultivated once, as one, and eech acre cultivated twice, as two.It is not easy to show statistically the result of thePeriod.Total&quot;Men1s Acres worked.Weekly Average.
The above results, which represent a very considerable increase in the production of food, are mainly due to the influence which Mr.John Allen, the Chairman of the Steam Cultivation Development AssCciation, exerts upon his colleagues in the industry.     Mr;Allen was appointed in March last the Departments Honorary Adviser in Steam Cultivation, and has since that date been responsible for all the work of this Section.     During the Department1s efforts in the Spring to increase the area under cultivation for the 1917 harvest, some   difficulties were experienced owing to the Government-owned motor tractors in certain counties competing with the privately owned steam tackle sets, both in respect of the work to be undertaken and the price charged. .   This difficulty has now been overcome by appointing a/representative of the steam tackle industry on the Machinery Sub-Committee in each.of the counties in which steam tackle are worked, and there can be no doubt that this step has had a very considerable effect in enlisting the co-operation of steam tackle owners in the work of this Department.In view of the large amount of work which each set of steam tackle is capable of undertaking in the course,of-a year, the Department felt it was essential to increase to the utmost extent possible, the limited number of sets at present available in this country.     Arrangements y/ere accordingly made through the Ministry of Munitions with Messrs.John Fowler of Leeds,  (by which firm practically the whole of the existing sets have been manufactured) to increase their output to the maximum extent. The result has been that this firm has been enabled to supply 23 sets to owners whose orders had been - awaiting execution for a long period and one further set is almost ready for delivery. In addition, they are at present engaged in manufacturing to this Departments order 65 complete sets.     Sixty-four of these sets will be sold to owners selected by this Department, payment being
made in six annual instalments.     Care is being taken that these sets are only supplied to those owners who are making the maximum, use of their present sets.     The remaining set is to bo worked by the Essex Agricultural Executive Committee,     Next Spring there will, therefore, be 89 new sets of steam tackle at work in England and Wales, and this will represent a very great increase to the mechanical ploughing and cultivating facilities . available in this country.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.   Returns are now being obtained of the amount of Sulphate of Ammonia stored by Approved Agents.     The results appear very satisfactory and it is clear that considerable quantities of Sulphate have been placed in store in country districts. This will greatly help to relieve the demand next spring.Returns from Sulphate of Ammonia Makers suggest that the balance available for agricultural purposes after al lowing for the demands for explosives is much less than was anticipated.     The estimates are now being re-examined, but it seems not improbable that it may be necessary to press the Ministry of Munitions to meet their.requirements by the use of some other material in order not to prejudice agricultural needs.Basic Slag.    Analyses have been made cf the accumulations of low grade slag, and these show- that this slag when ground has an average content of about 20% of total phosphate.     Arrangements are being made for these slags to be ground and the additional supply thus available will help to meet the large demand existing at the present time.Compound Manure:.   The Draft Order in regard to Compound Manures was considered by the Phosphates and Potash Committee, and finally agreed with the Ministry of wiunitions and representatives of makers.
i 1 9Potash.   As a result of conferences with the Ministry of Munitions, it has been arranged that Blast Furnace Flue dust containing potash should only he sold for direct application to the soil and that applications for sale to Compound Manure makers should be refused.   Terms of sale have been agreed with a firm * of Blast Furnace owners, who have undertaken to act in accordance with the instructions of the Department. The Dust will be sold in four grades at the price of approximately 4/6 per unit of sulphate of potash, plus a charge of 15/- for bags and bagging. The Flue Dust will be sold through the Approved Agents. Lime.   Efforts are being made to meet the requirements of lime producers in regard to labour by placing at their disposal prisoners of war, and the Department is also communicating with the National Service Department in.regard to the supply of ordinary labour.   After considerable negotiations as to the utilisation of waste carbonate of lime at soap works and similar factories, it appears unlikely that any appreciable quantities will be available, but the more hopeful projects are still being examined. Seed Meat.   The total quantity of 1917 seed which is in the hands of Storage Agents at present amounts to 2,277 quarters; and the total sales amount to 567 quarters.Seeds (other than Cereals).     A joint meeting of the Advisory Committees on Cereals and Seeds will be held on the 12th instant when a draic of the Seed Testing Order, 1917, will be considered. Seed Potatoes.     The total quantity of seed of immune varieties secured by the Purchasing Committee in England amounts to 2,660 tons 10 cwts.
Information received from the Board of Agriculture for Scotland indicates that 5^000 tons of seed of the Varieties &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Great Scot&quot; and &quot;Templar&quot; is likely to be available for the use of English growers,I am?Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. lion, Rowland E.
