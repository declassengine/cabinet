HMINISTRY   OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, October 10, 1917.PART I. ACTION  TAKEN.Control,of Supplies and Prices.; Allied Purchases. Mr. Owen Smith and his staff have arrived in New York and -propose to set up an office at 165, Broadway.   Mr. Hoover is setting up an office in New York with a responsible officer in charge so as to save the British, delegates from constantly travelling to Washington.A meeting was held with Mr. Hoover at Washington on Friday, October 5, at which the whole question of supplies of food other than cereals and sugar was discussed. Mr. Hoover expressed his anxiety to assist in every possible way, and explained that, with the object of keeping prices, both domestic and export, within reasonable limits, lie was working on a plan to increase the crop of hogs and control the packers with a limitation of their profits. He laid great stress upon the necessity of all buying for export being centralised in one organisation and expressed the wish that the requirements of the Belgian and Portuguese Governments should be dealt with in common with those of other Allied Powers.The Canadian Food Controller has decided to appoint a responsible representative in New York to assist co-ordination of purchases and is communicating with Mr. Hoover on the subject.Bacon, Rams, and Lard. The first shipments of American bacon bought on Government account are on their way to the United Kingdom. It has been agreed that American bacon is to be distributed only through the American Packers&apos; Agents.The maximum price of lard is to be raised 8s. to 132s. per cwt. in order to get a certain amount of existing stocks on to the market. This step is being taken as a result of the Lard (Returns) Order.Butter. The purchase of Canadian butter at 205s. per cwt. f.o.b. has been increased by 200 tons to 500 tons.Cereals, Flour, and Wheat. The Bread (Use of Potatoes) Order, 1917, dated October 5, 1917, sanctions the use of potatoes in the manufacture of bread. Until further order, the maximum quantity that may be so used is limited to 1 lb. of potatoes for every 7 lbs. of flour. The experiments recently carried out by the Food Production Department have proved that a palatable loaf of good colour and sound keeping qualities can be obtained by an admixture of potatoes with Government regulation flour, and leaflets are being prepared for the purpose of showing how the best results can be obtained.Under Article 10 of the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 1917, the Food Con-troller has determined that on and after October 9 no person shall, except under licence, take delivery of any flour for the manufacture of rusks, biscuits, bread, or any other product made wholly or in part from flour for use in the making of sausages, black puddings, and all such preparations. Licences for such purposes will be issued on payment of the sum of 18s. per 280 lbs.Dried Fruits.-Offers have been received from our mission in Greece, but the prices quoted were regarded as too high throughout. The mission has been autho-rised to purchase 1,500 tons of currants at a price agreed on by the Advisory Committee; the purchase, of sultanas and figs has been postponed pending further offers.The Foreign Office have sent a copy of a proposed agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Spanish Government whereby the former undertake to allow the importation of at least 6,000 tons of raisins. A conference.was held at the Foreign Office on October 10, when this matter was discussed. Negotiations for purchase are in abeyance, pending Treasury sanction for the necessary finance.Information has been received that the Portuguese Government have forbidden the export of figs. The Foreign Office have been requested to obtain a relaxation of this embargo in favour of the figs required by this Ministry.i       I9.9\AIVTS       O lA   (33)4075-2   Pk 1   GO   10/17   E&amp;S
A general licence has been issued under the Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order, 1917, enabling all persons to deal in Tunisian and Egyptian dates outside the United Xingdom.Feeding&apos;Stuffs.  Meetings of the Compound Cake Manufacturers&apos; Committee and of the Central Feeding Stuffs Advisory Committee have been held. A general scheme of distribution has been agreed upon and sub-committees have been set up to discuss tlie principles and machinery of rationing the farmer, and to select from the various nominations received from the different interests concerned the members of the several committees which are to deal with local distribution.Fish. The Sea Fishing (Scotland) Order, 1917, dated October 10, 1917, empowers the Fishery Board for Scotland, with the consent of the Secretary for Scotland, to authorise the use of any method or appliance for taking fish within the parts of the sea adjoining Scotland that is at present unlawful at times and in places now pro-hibited. The sale of fish so caught may also be authorised. This Order corresponds generally with those already made relating to England and Wales and to Ireland.Live Stock and Meat.  On Tuesday, October 9, Lord Rhondda, who was accompanied by Mr. Prothero, received a deputation, introduced by Sir Beville Stanier, M.P., representing the Central Chamber of Agriculture, the National Farmers&apos; Union, and the Royal Agricultural Society, together with representatives of the Scottish and Irish agricultural organisations. Lord Rhondda informed the deputation that he must remain obdurate on the maintenance of the 60s. live weight basis as the figure which he intended should be ultimately reached. He was, however, prepared to continue the operation of the December price viz., 67s. per cwt. live weight for Army cattle and 8s. per stone of 8 lb. dead weight for civilian supplies, and to postpone the coming into operation of the lowest maximum price until the end of June 1918. He was willing to adopt this course owing to the probable world shortage of meat next spring, and the consequent necessity of encouraging production. The deputation assured Lord Rhondda that the postpone-ment of the lowest maximum price would check the slaughter of immature cattle and secure increased supplies during the spring months.The increase in the export of store cattle from Ireland to Great Britain is shown by the following table :  Week ending August 4th -		-    1,144j j	,, nth -	-    1,184J 5  -	,,   18th -	-    1,782))	,,   25th -	-    2,127JJ	September 1st -	-    4,252J J	8th -	-    5,391;)	15th -	-    6,931)5	,,     2:.&apos;nd -	-   10,045Jj	29th-	-   12,841	October 6th -	-   13,357Milk.- On October 8th a general licence was issued permitting retailers to sell milk to purchasers who. will again re-sell it at prices not exceeding the fixed retail prices.Under the terms of the Milk Order, 1917, such a sale had to be made at the wholesale prices which the seller had actually given for the milk; thus he had to sell either at a loss or without profit; the present licence has the effect of distributing the retailers&apos; permitted profit, and does not affect the consumers&apos; prices in any way.A scheme is being drawn up to enable expectant and mirsing mothers and young children to obtain, where necessa^, a supply of milk at reduced prices.Oils and Fats. Negotiations in order to obtain complete control of the Oils and Fats Trade are continued, with the object of keej)ing profits down to the minimum and of utilising as far as possible the existing channels of supply and distribution.Negotiations are in progress with the Shipping Controller to obtain such Government freight space as is requisite for the minimum requirements of the Soap and Margarine Trade ; it is essential to secure sufficient Oils and Fats for the Soap Trade in order that a supply of Glycerine may be obtained. The merchants and manufacturers concerned are disposed to facilitate negotiations as far as possible, and individual firms do not object to their profits being reduced to the minimum as long as their business is maintained in such working order that they will be able to face foreign competition after the war.
Regulation- of Public Meals. By* a general licence under the Public Meals Order 1917, meals served to persons passing the night in an inn, hotel, or boarding-house&apos; may be allowed for under the scale set forth in the Order notwithstanding that such meals are served after 9.30 p.m.rpea_The scheme for the purchase of tea on behalf of Government in India andCeylon is being despatched to the India and Colonial Offices, and should soon be in working order.It is reported that 8,000,009 lbs. of tea have been or are being landed at Liver-pool, and that 17,000,000 lbs. will be approaching that port within the next few days. In view of the lack of facilities at Liverpool for dealing with these large cargoes, arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Shipping to divert as many as possible of the vessels bringing them to Manchester, where the cargoes can be dealt with more expeditiously.Local Authorities.Food Control Committees. Of the 19] 5 local authorities approached with a reouest to appoint Food Control Committees only 22 are now unaccounted for in any way, and probably the majority of those have amalgamated with other committees. A complete list of Food Control Committees, with the names and addresses of their executive officers, has been prepared and put in type and will be available for general use as soon as it has been corrected.Sugar. The 6th of October was the last date for the receipt of applications for sugar registration cards from heads of households. The Department have decided to ask for a preliminary return of the total number of persons included in such applications, to be sent in by Food Control Committees to the Ministry by the 12th October. xAbout J ,600 committees have now sent in returns showing the number of retailers of sugar registered by them under the sugar scheme. It has also been decided by the Department to ask for a return of the number of persons in institutions receiving authorities for sugar supplies under the scheme.Satisfactory arrangements for the continuance of supplies of sugar to prisoners of war have now been concluded w-ith the Central Prisoners of War Committee.Meat. The Divisional Commissioners report that the Food Control Committees are finding some difficulty over the fixing of schedules of meat prices and other duties in connection with maximum prices under the Meat Order. No doubt as the terms of the Order become better understood and as more expert advice becomes available, these difficulties will be cleared away.Enforcement of Orders.Meat [Maximum Prices) Order. Several complaints have been received from the North of Ireland that this Order is not being observed in the meat markets and the matter has been referred to the Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary, Dublin. The Chief Secretary for Ireland has suggested that a conference should be held between the Inspector-General, R.I.C., the Food Control Committee, and the Chief Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Police, in order to co-ordinate the w^ork of enforcing the Food Orders. -Meat Sales Order. A butcher of Bath was fined 150Z. at Bristol. He resold at a profit 61 sheep which the Order required him to slaughter.. Price of Milk Orders. At Chelmsford on the 5th instant, a number of milk producers were convicted for charging prices in excess of the legal maximum. In two cases fines of 20L were imposed, in one case Ibl., in two cases 10L, and in one 21. At St. Helens Police Court, Lancashire, 23 local farmers and milk dealers were summoned under the same Order for exceeding the legal price. Two of the defendants were fined 50L each, two more 251. each, and the others in sums of 10L and below. The Bench stated that Jhey looked,upon these cases with very great seriousness, and added that the farmers and milk dealers had been deliberately extracting large sums of money to which they were not entitled, and had acted in open defiance of the Orders. .. &apos;Feeding of Game Order-^pase is reported from Horncastle in Lincolnshire on. : the 6th instant of a fine of 20L for feeding.pheasants with corn.   Several similar cases are under enquiry.
&apos; .  PART IP-SUMMARY - OF THE FOOD POSITION.Stocks.In view of the anxiety felt as to the stocks of tea in the country an order was issued calling for a return from all holders of upwards of 500 lbs. on September 3rd, distinguishing between tea in bond.and tea out of bond. Returns received from 4,627 holders showed that these held 58,300,000 lbs., of which 31,000,000 lbs. was in bonded warehouses and the rest out of &quot;bond. If to that be added the tea held in smaller quantities it is clear that the total was in excess of 60,000,0u0 lbs., thus providing for more than ten weeks&apos; consumption. Since then, stock has still further diminished owing to the exceptionally low imports arriving in the month of September. According.to a. special.count on the night of September 30th of the tea actually in bonded warehouses, the total was only 26,600,000 lbs. This figure does not include tea 021 the ship or waiting to be warehoused. It includes or may include tea in. bond belonging to or held on behalf of foreign owners, which would not appear in the former return. In any case, however, it indicates considerable reduction during the month. If the Customs figures of tea in bonded warehouses or waiting to be ware-housed be compared, the total on September 1st was 52,000,000 lbs., while on October 1st it was only 36,000,000.. Imports.The aggregate of imports of principal foods (including rice) last week, viz. :  151,400 tons is the lowest recorded since March, the amount is 63,400 tons less than the previous week (Table A).Wheat and flour have fallen 10,000 tons, other cereals 29,000 tons. Oats have fallen from 44,000 tons to a more normal level, and only 2,760 tons of maize were received, but barlejr has increased to 17,700 tons after several weeks of small imports and was 4 per cent, above the corresponding week last year. Bread-stuffs as a whole (iucluding rice) only amounted to 98,500 tons, which is greatly below the quantity needed on the average throughout the year.Of beef and mutton 10,200 tons were imported, that is 4,300 tons above the previous week.There was a great falling off in cheese and butter.36,700 tons of sugar and glucose were imported, though above the average for the first nine months of this year or last, this quantity is 19,000 tons less than in the previous week.       .. -.....       .   -.Consumption.The supply of home-fed meat at the markets of London, Manchester, Glasgow, ,and Liverpool, in the week ended September 29th, was 7 per cent, below that in the previous week, but 13 per cent, above that in the corresponding week last year (Table B). The average for September was 10 per cent, above that for August in 1917, whereas last year the corresponding rise was 23 per cent. ; but since the supply .in August 1917 was abnormally high, that for September 1917 is still 10 per cent, above September 1916.The course of supplies of fat stock (Table C) on which are based the index numbers of home-fed meat in Table B is somewhat different. Comparing September 1917 with September 1916, in cattle the increase is 7 per cent.; in sheep, \\ per cent.; while in the number of pigs there is a marked decrease.Taking cattle, sheep, and pigs together0 we find (Table D) that the supply of home-fed stock fell 1 per cent, from August to September 1917, whereas it rose *2 per cent, from August to September 1916. The supply in September 1917 is about 1 per cent, above September 1916, but as already pointed out there is a well defined increase in cattle: ^ The decrease in the number of pigs obscures the undoubted rise in the consumption of other home-fed meat.m . The foreign meat supply at the four markets (Table D) averaged 2 per cent, less in September 1917 than in August 1917 and was only&apos; two-thirds the supply of September 1916. There can be no doubt that when foreign and home supplies are taken together the consumption of meat was lower in September 1917 than in September 1916-the combined index-number shows a decrease of 13 per cent., and* At 6 cwt. for cattle, 67 lbs. for sheep and 160 lbs. for pigs.

They are now at nearly the same level as in September 1916.Margarine has not changed, but butter has risen 4 per cent, in the month. Milk has risen 10 per cent., and eggs show a seasonal rise.   Cheese has fallen slightly.When these changes are combined, each commodity being given the same relative importance as in pre-war times, the fall in the month is nearly 4 per cent, and the index number is 97 per cent, above the pre-war level.&quot; But in dealing with these numbers allowance should be made for changes induced by the abnormal conditions of supply, and no simple and satisfactory statement - can&apos; be made as to the actual increase of the cost of living to the working-class. An idea of the change involved can be given by taking a budget of expenditure in which only British meat was used, margarine bought instead of butter, eggs dispensed with, meat used instead of bacon and fish,- and sugar reduced to one-half the pre-war level; then the fall in the last month would be 8 per cent, instead of 4 per cent.* These percentages are not stated iu the Table, bnt are deducible from it.&apos;a   4075-2Bthe information indicates that there was very little change between August and September 1917,-k - ;-   ;&apos;-j --&apos;\ -;, .....^/. -     y-     1 Wholesale Prices. .The price of Argentine beef (Table E) hasrisen 4s. to 96s.&apos;6cl per cwt., but is still, lower, than&apos;at anytime from May .6th to September 19th. Cheddar cheese has also risen 4s. to 144s. per cwt.   Otherwise there are no changes of importance.Retail Prices. - -&quot;  r - - -: The price changes shown in Table G are obtained by the Department of Labour Statistics from informants throughout the country and are based on the -actual prices paid by the working-classes. This month they are of special interest since they tend to show howr far the statutory changes have resulted in visible reductions in prices paid.   &quot;&apos;    :      &quot;. ; p .&quot;;     - ,      &apos;     &apos;The most important quotations for meat are probably British beef (ribs) and British mutton.(legs). The former has fallen nearly 7 per cent.* in jthe month, and has returned to the same price as on June 1st, 1917 ; the latter has fallen about 9 per cent., and is now below the price of June 1st, but above that of May &quot;1st.&apos; The; cheaper kinds of British meat have fallen more ; thin- flank (British) is ,8 per cent, below the price of September 1st, and breast of mutton (British) 14 per cent, below. The price of foreign meat has also fallen, but not so much. -     - -       .: ;The prices of all kinds of meat have&apos;fallen more in &quot;the large towns than in the small towns and villages :  .Percentage Fall from September 1st to October 1st, 1917.
