(This Document is the Property ofilHis Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government)RE? OUT  TO  OOHOOLLJSB  OF  TBS  NAVY.GABbyden Macassey. Director of Shipyard Labour. T on the^,.ie^*of the Proposed Order by the Minister of Munitions,, &quot;^der Section 1 of the Munitions of War Act 1917 for Wages Advances to Certain Time-paid Skilled Mene1, Several of the recent Commissions on Industrial unrest re-commended that provision should be made for increasing the earnings of time-paid skilled men working in association with piece-paid semi-skilled operatives by the establishment of a fellowship bonus system or some other such bonus on output.2. On August 15th, 191?, on consideration in Committee ofHouse cf Commons of the Munitions of War (Recommitted) Bill,the Minister of Munitions made the following statement, (S6eParliamentary Debates, Vol.97,.No,117-1300).f&apos;The swiftly developing conditions of labour during this. War have led to the creation of great and invidious   * anomalieso    We have seen - aad there are numerous in-stances of it all over&quot; the country - highly skilled men who have taught the others are working, unaer time rates; &apos; at comparatively low wages, and who see side by side with tnem. in the same shops, newcomers, whose skill, such as it is, has been hastily acquired, and who onOn August 21st 1917, the Minister of Munitions appointed a Committee to enquire and report upon the rates of wages of skilled men on munitions work employed on day rates with special reference tot-(a) The discrepancy between such rates.and the:earnings of less skilled men engaged under systems of payment by results;   and(b) The possible effect of this discrepancy in view of -f   ./the decision to abolish the provisions of the Muni-Y      tions^Aots dealing with Leaving Certificates;with due regard to the public interest,&apos; both;-(a) in the matter of expense, and(b) the increased output of munitions of war;
The Committee was presided over by Major JcW- Hills, M*P. and consisted of Representatives of the Engineering, Ship-building and National Employers&apos; Moderations, the  A.S.E. Steam Engine Makers&apos; and Toolriakers&apos; Societies, the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions and Ministry of labour,5,      The Employers1 Representatives on the Committee proposed the granting of bonuses to certain classes of skilled men working on time, subject to the condition, in the case of all save a very limited class of special skilled men, that such bonuses should not be paid in cases where the men had been given and refused an opportunity of working on a system of payment by results..    This condition the Employers regarded as fundamental in the national interests and pointed out thai all work of an engineering character is in some shop or other done on a system of payment hy resultso    The Union Representatives cn the Committee refused however to proceed unless this gti-pulation was withdrawn.    A deadlock arose which was referred to the Minister of MunitionSoThere were on this occasion submitted to the Minister&apos;three reportsOne by the Employers&apos;   insisting that with the exception of a very small class of special men, a bonus should not be paid where the men were given an opportunity of working on a system of payment by resultsaA second by the Trade Union Representatives who insisted upon a uniform flat bonus to all skilled men in the Engineering Industry *A third by the Departmental Representatives who urged the importance of nothing j^eing aone which would retard the extension of a system of payment by results*
The ilinister- indicated to the Committee that he was of opinion that the Employers1 proposal should not be adopted and he requested the Committee to reconsider the matter on this basis.   The Employers took no further part in the Com-mitteers proceedings but submitted an independent report to the Minister.On September 21st, 1917, the Committee, with the exception of the Employers, presented a report to the Minister of Munitions, recommending the payment of a scale of bonuses to all skilled men employed on time, in the engineering trade.The Minister of Munitions now proposes to make an Srder granting a bonus of 15$ on earnings to the following classes of time-paid skilled men engaged in the Engineering Trades on Munitions worfo.(a) Fully-Qualified skilled men in the EngineeringTrades in the following occupations rated at or above the current district time-rate for turners or fitters.Charge Hands (Engineering).Gaugers.Inspectors.Markers Off.;Millwrights.Setters-up of Machine Tools (e.g,, automatics, capstan or Turret Lathes, etc)-Toolmakers and Soolsmiths.Viewers.(b) Fully-qualified skilled men in the Engineering Tradesrated at or above the current district time-rate for turners or fitters and engaged in maintenance or repair work.(o) Fully-qualified skilled men in the Engineering Trades rated at or above the current district time-rate for turners or fitters and engaged in the provision/KL.
of light,&quot;heat or power for the use of the estab-lishinent in which &quot;they are employed.(d) Fully-qualified skilled men in the Ingineering Trades rated at or above the current district time-rate for turners or fitters and employed in public utility undertakings for the supply of light, h6at, water, power or tramways facilities.It is proposed that the Government and not the Employersshould pay this bonus.I,      The intention of the proposed Order is two-fold:-(l)   To remove the difference in earnings between the time-paid skilled men and the piece-paid semi-skilled and unskilled operatives,(2)   To prevent skilled men leaving their time-paid skilled work on the abolition of the Leaving&quot;Certificates&quot; and taking up higher piece-paid semi-skilled work,9.      The proposed Order will not achieve these purposes. The grievance in many Engineering Shops is that certain semi-skilled and unskilled operatives working on piece-work make much larger earnings than the timo-paid skilled men on whom they are dependant.   The proposed percentage bonuses will not bring the earnings of the skillod men who recoive them up to the level of the semi-skilled and unskilled operatives in question.Seoondly, as the earnings of the skilled men will remain lower than the semi-skilled and unskilled operatives even after the concession of the bonus, there will not be any financial inducement for the time-paid skilled men to remain at their skilled work and refrain from going on less skilled pieoe-paid work.   If it is intended to prevent such waste of skilled la-kcur Employers can and ought to be prevented, under No.8a of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, from employing skilled men on semi-skilled work.   That is the proper remedy.
The proposed Order gives a bonus to a certain number of time-paid skilled men and irrespective of whether they have been working in connection with piece-paid semi-skilled and unskilled operatives or note   It is obvious that the same bonus will and can logically be claimed and must ultimately be paid to all time-paid skilled men in the engineering trade because they all, like the limited class of proposed recipient under the Order, can point to some higher piece-paid semi-skilled and unskilled operatives.   That this will be so, appe appears from the Report of the Committee, who apparently found them-selves unable to draw any line and recommended a bonus to all time-paid skilled men in the trade.Without question similar bonuses can logically be claimed and it would seem, on grounds of equity, must ultimately be paid to all time-paid semi-skilled and unskilled men in the Engineering Trade.   These men naturally feel a grievance that they are not or cannot be put on piece-work and therefore cannot make the same high earnings as members of their own occupations make who are on piece-work.Once the above-mentioned principle is admitted in the Engineering Trade it must ultimately be admitted in the Shipbuilding Trade,   There is developing among the Boiler-makers a very strong movement for abandoning payment by results and introducing in its place a time-rate with a make up bonus up to the approximate level of piece-work earnings.  Further, by reason of the publicity attaching to the question in the Engineering  Trade, semi-skilled, men in the Shipyards now paid on time and working with piece-workers are claiming bonuses on their time-rates.-5-1
(3,     The proposed Or dor for the first time in the history of the Engineering industry givea effect to two new principles: -(a) It provides for a percentage wage increase not casedon any economic datum, as. for example, the increased cost of living which has been the ground on which, up to the present, wage advances have been based, but on a purely arbitrary and empirical percentage which cannot be tested on any economic ground.   This will undermine very seriously the practice and procedure of the Committee on Production which has now secured very general approval and authority in the industrial world. Once the percentage ba^is is adopted there will commence a regular agitation for the increase of the percentage and the amount of the increase will merely become a question of opportunism as to the amount, from timo to time, requisite to keep tho applicant trades quiet.   There can be little question that tho time-paid trades will ultimately claim as a minimum the highest general average earnings customary amongst piece-workers in their respective trades.(b) It virtually establishes a principle that the day ratesof men not working at piece-work speed, should appro&amp;imate-ly be the same as those new working at pie co-work. This has long been the contention of an advanced section of the Trade Union movement but if adopted, would be a very serious blow to the English Engineering and Shipbuilding industry. 14.     A further offect would be to prevent materially the further extension of systems of payment by results as ordered by the War Cabinet, (See War Cab. Decision No.49.1 (l) &amp; (2) Jan.30.1917) which it is understood the War Cabinet regard as a matter of prime importance and which the Admiralty have been successful in effect-ing in the case of certain trades with most satisfactory results.
The time-paid skilled men generally have no grievance that a number of semi-skilled men are making substantially higher earnings.   In cases where that occurs it is due to the fact that under the&apos;Treasury Agreement, the Munitions of War Act,1915, and the documents known as L.8.&amp;.L.3. the piece-prices for semi- and unskilled operatives doing skilled work are based on the skilled manfs time-rate. Thjs was expressly provided to protect the skilled manfs trade, and to keep up the price of his labour. The higher, therefore, the piece price the more us the skilled man protected.   He cannot therefore on the ground of height of price make any legit mate complaint.Apart from the general sentimental grievance in theEngineering Trade on the part of some skilled men who donot understand the reason that semi-skilled operatives incertain cases make higher earnings than a skilled man, thereal case to, be met in practice is the direct personalgrievance and legitimate complaint of the time-paid skilledman working in tool-rooms and places of that sort in con-nection with piece-paid operatives who finds himself withlower earnings than the semi-skilled and unskilled opera-tives instructed by, or dependent on him.   The operativeswake higher earnings for four reasons, because:-Firstly, the semi-skilled operatives are prepared to go and do go on a system of payment by re-sults.Secondly.the price paid to them is based on the skilled man&apos;s high time-rate,.Thirdly, the rate of output of the semi-skilled opera-tive has been much increased by the provision by the Employers of -jigs, special tools, and other devises for making machines ffool-prooffFourthly, In some cases  before semi-skilled men want en to the work, the prices have been fixed.
much too high, owing to the skilled men holding&quot;back production or through mistake   both on the part of the Employers and of &quot;the Government Department concerned.If then the time-paid skilled men desire to havetheir position remedied they, like the semi-skilled men,should be prepared to go on to a system of payment by re-sults wherever possible.   It is wholly unreasonable for themto refuse to do so and at the same time claim time-earningsas great as the piece-earnings of the semi-skilled operatives.Where, thereforej it is practicable to put the skilledmen on to a system of payment by results it is essentialin the national interests of both production and- economy thatthey should be so put and not paid a bonus independent ofoutput. The order, it is recognised, should not operate asa compulsory measure to substitute payment by results, forpayment on time, but at the same time it is submitted it oughtnot to prevent the introduction or extension of payment byresults in proper cases.   So Ion;.- as the Wtrr Cabinet policyis payment by results ^proper cases a potential piece-workerwho refuses to go on to piece work should be refused a bonus.The next question is the system of payment by resultsto be adopted.   That should so far as possible be left toagreement between masters and men.   On the general question ofthe system, this may be saidl:   Strong objection would be raisedby the skilled men to the premium bonus system. That unlessagreed between management and men has to be excluded from prac-tical consideration. The next system is piece-work.While thathi much more acceptable to the skilled men&quot;, yet in some eases itwould be impracticable.   In such quarters as there are objectionso the part
of the men to piece-work they are usually based on the ground that each piece-worker tends to become a separate self-seeking unit, without any interest in the general life and welfare of the shop, keeping himself, his earnings, hig tools apart, and often competing with his fellows for the use of necessary facilities, and if he is on day shift, working up to the limit of his time and therefore frequently not heve-tailing&quot; his work into that of his mate on night shift,   Hie next system is shop output bonus or fellowship system to which no such objections apply.  Under it the shop works as a united community and the output of a whole establishment ot the respective output of the constituent parts, egg* machine shop, smithy, foundry, etc, are priced, or a graduated bonus applied after the output exceeds a certain amount.   The balance after payment of day rates to all operatives of every class concerned is carried to a comon pool which is divided amongst them in pro-portion to day rates.   To this system there is rarely any object on the part of the skilled men.   It is working with smojthnoss and success in a number of large engineering establishments and would effectively meet the present case.   It would ensure in-struction by and co-operation on the part of the skilled men. The greater their efforts the greater the output and the more their bonus.   Assuming the Government does not pay the bonus the only objection likely to be raised to the shop output bonus or fellowship system would come from the semi-skilled operatives who would possibly object to any portion of their earnings being divided among the skilled men who instructed them, or on whom they were dependent for tools, etc.   But the Government are in a strong position to deal with the
semi-skilled operatives.   They are nothing like so vital to the industry as the skilled men.   The Governments pledge against reduction of piece-prices would not be affected. Strictly speaking, in almost every case, through changes in the mode of manufacture, since the piece-price was fixed, owing to the application of jigs, provision of special tools, and adoption of fool-proof devices, the Employers could without any violation of the pledge, if they had liked to enforce their right, reduce the price and therefore the earnings of the semi-skilled operatives.    Bat no reduction of price whatever is involved under the shop output bonus, or fellowship system.19. As it is recognised under the circumstances as theynow exist that something must be done, it is urged, in view of the very serious industrial effects that would result j from the operation of the proposed order, that the order be amended to provide that a bonus on the principle of the shop output or fellowship system (unless by agreement between master and man some other system is adopted) be paid to time-paid skilled men in the engineering trade working for, with or in connection with piece paid operatives.   This would meet the existing necessities of the case, and would appear fully to concede all that has been promised by the Minister of Munitions.20. My opinion  as to the serious effect of proposals suchas are contained in the proposed order is I may say shared by the Shipbuild:xg Employers&apos; Federation, and by Trade Unionists on the staff fcf the Shipyard Labour Department, and also by my experienced local officers in the different districts.(Signed)  LIKDEN MACASSEY.
