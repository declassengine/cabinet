(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC ^JBSTYfS GOVERNMENT)8WAR CABINET.FOETH-CLYDE CANAL.Note by the Secretary.The Forth-Clyde Canal Scheme was considered by the Defence Committee come years ago but failed at that time to find favour with the Admiralty and was dropped, any canal via the Clyde being definitely excluded though a canal via Loch Long, Loch Lomond and the Forth River Y/as looked upon as more desirable.Early in 1917 the question was again raised - being brought up by Sir Chas, Ottley - of the firm cf kessrs. Armstrong - on the grounds that though it will not be feasible to commence the canal during the present war, it was a matter for consideration as to whether the final surveys should not be undertaken at once.       This would mean the employment of very few men.   The cost of the survey would be about  15,000 and the work would take about a year to complete.The point was urged that it might be advantageous to have the scheme cut and dried so that it would form a &quot;stabilizer&quot; for labour after the war whilst our armies were being re-absorbed into the industrial life of the country.The matter was In consequence referred to the Admiralty for their vievfs as to how. far the experience of the war had modified the previous conclusions on the utility of such a canal.The Admiralty reply was communicated to the War Cabinet in G. T. 909 of 31st May, 1917, but for convenience I will summarise it :-The view of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty was that a Ship Canal between the Forth and Clyde would have been of very great value during the present war and the following reasons are given -(a) It would have enabled His Majesty&apos;s Ships based on Rosyth and bound to and from Western ports for refit, &amp;c, to avoid some of tho dangers of the passage.,(b) The importance of a Canal after a Fleet action to ensure the safe passage of vessels docking at Liverpool., Glasgow and Belfast might in certain circumstances be very great.(c) It would help to ensure the safe delivery of heavy gun mountings and machinery that have to be sent by sea from the Tyne to the Clyde and vice versa..EC K E T. G.T.2299.
(d) It would reduce the heavy strain on railway roiling stock which is at present caused by the supply cf coal, as the coal from the South wales ports for Rosyth could be very easily and more conveniently carried by sea to the Clyde and thence by Canal.(e) It would render more secure the passage of oilers and merchant ships bound for East Coast ports from the westward and avoid the necessity of providing escorts.The Admiralty consider that the construction of the Canal   is a matter of strategic importance for the future, and recommend that as its main use will be strategic it should be under their jurisdiction.They point out that it does not appear that this strategic Canal can ever be self supporting, but are of opinion that its commercial value would be by no means negligible and it would probably yield a return on a substantial part, of the cost of construction estimated at  53,500,000 based however, on rates that were current a year before -war broke out.Their Lordships are of opinion that the route through Loch Lomond and Loch Long is the only one which satisfies Haval requirements.The Convention of Royal Burghs in Scotland (The Mid-Scotland Ship Canal National Association, the Corporation of Glasgow and the Glasgow Ghamber of Commerce) advocate however, the direct route joining the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth to the Clyde at Clydebank,Some of the reasons they give are(a) The Canal would be at sea level.(b) It would pass through a Commercial and Industrial valley which is also the richest mineral field in Scotland, and thus tend to develop the important industries centred there.(c) Saving in distance, though it would probably be more expensive to construct.To meet the opposition to the Loch Lomond route that may be expected from the mercantile world of Glasgow, as such a route would not materially increase the facilities for water transport from that port to the East Coast, Messrs. -rmstrong have now put forward a further proposal, namely, a branch canal along the valley of the Leven for the use of trading dhips between Loch Lomond and the River Clyde at an estimated cost of  4,431,000.
sIn view of the foregoing the War Cabinet may &quot;think it desirable to appoint a Committee on whichThe AdmiraltyWar OfficeBoard of TradeScottish OfficeMinistry of ShippingMinistry of LabourMinistry of Reconstructionmight be represented, to enquire into and report whether they recommend that any of these canals should be con -strueted, if so which they advocate and what steps they consider should be ta^en during tho war with a view to giving effect to their recommendations.(Sd.)
