Department ef Information. Intelligence Bureau. FFW/013.Weekly Report cn France, XIII. (October 11th, 1917)France has passed an agitated fortnight since the last Report v/as written.     First of all came, on Sept, 37th, the citation be-fore the Court of Cassation of M. Momier, President of the Court of Appeal, one of the highest judioial personages of France, on the charge of professional misconduct.     The charge refers to his having rendered certain legal services to the aeoused adventurer Bolo Pasha.     Ho one accuses him of treason.     The matter has not yet come before the Court of Cassation and its principal immediate interest is that it disposes of the rumour reported by Lord Bertie that M. Poineare .was the person who had guaranteed BoloTs nharacter to M. Humbert, the Senator for whoso newspaper, Le Journal, Bolo \vas providing very large funds,     Lord Bortie even believed that the long delay in arresting Bolo was due to the President.   But it is said that M. Poincare deolarec that he only met Bolo twice.     That he might easily have dono, as Bolo had a large social and political acquaintance which indludcd many respeotable ueoplc:   and, whatever its motives may bet the Victotre, which is now almost a Government paper, is perfectly justified in saying that there would be nc reason for great surprise or scandal if it turned out that the ad-venturer had suoceeded in gaining admission to the Vatiean or the Elyaee.   Probably the Vatican appears here in order to make the allusion to the Elysee less marked, and the whole article may be wittem to cover 11, Poincare.     He has plenty of enemies;   from the Socialists who dislike him en principle as representing, both officially and presonally, what remains of the monarchical element in the Constitution of the Republic - they denounce for instance, tho
ceremony and expense of his visits to the Army - to his many politi-cal rivals who hate him on personal grounds and are even anxious -like M. Clemenceati - to bring about a Presidential crisis involving his fall.     To bring him down, however, they will require a good deal mere ammunition than there is at present any sign of theic possessing:   and meanwhile he reaains a personage to be reckoned with, who not merely presides at Cabinet Councils, but exercises considerable influenoe.     The fact that II. Steeg is the Presidents intimate friend certainly did not stand in the way of his being appointed Minister of the Interior the other day, and, a still more important instance, the fact that Mi Poincars disliked General retain, who had spoken rather unceremoniously to him, &amp;s said to have had a good deal to do with delaying Fetain&apos;s promotion to be Commander in Chief.     By far the greatest proof of decision and strength of will given by the present Prime Minister was his in-sistcnce on this, against the opposition of nearly all his col-leagues, after the failure of the April offensive, thoughBut/there is so far no sign of the Bolo scandal involving IL Poincare, it has already entiBBly eolipsed the other &quot;affaires&quot; in the scale and sensational character of its disclosures.     There have been other arrests:   M. Tunnel, the Deputy of whom mention was mado in the last Report, and hi3 wife:   an Austrian who kept the Hotel Astoria by the Arc 4u Triomphe and always managed to evade the order to demolish the Hotol Cunolas, which were higher than the law allows, and it is new alleged, contained wireless apparatus;   and others.     But all are forgotten in Bolo who seems to have been the arch traitor, operating everywhere in Prance, Spain, the United States, and, it is said, even in England.     He was at last arrested on Sept. 29th and ever since the Paris press has been full of him and his history ancient and modern.     There is no need to go into
- 3 -ithis here.     Ho doubt a great deal of what is said about hi&amp; career in the press Would not rrnss a judicial examination but at least it seems to be true that his life has been for many years that of an unprincipled financial adventurer.     His apparent wealth (and the real wealth of his wife) made him no doubt the best possible agent for the distribution of Gorman money, because the sgg^cr fact   of his r,osses8i$g large funds would not by itself arouse suspicion.   The whole affair has yet to bo unravelled before the Courts and it would be premature to discuss it.   But vt j seems already certain that he was in relations with Bornstorff in America and obtained large sums, the ultimate origin of which was the Deutsche Bank.     What he did with the money is less certain.     He is admitted to have approached many newspapers and two at least of them admit having taken his money -the Journal and the Rappel.     But thoy are very &quot;patriotic&quot; papers and it does not appear what Germany gained by subsidising them.   Per the argument used by some of their political opponents that their campaigns! for munitions and for annexing up to the left bank of the Hhine, were desired by Germany as reacting in favour of Krupp and Pan-Germanism, seems a little too subtle.     It looks, in fact, so * far, as if Bolo had taken the money of the Germans and spent a good deal of it not on their business but on his own pleasures, lawful and unlawful.     Well may a -French caricaturist represent the Kaiser complaining bitterly of the &apos;coquins&apos; who swindle him:   &quot;mais 3&apos;il faut m&apos;addresser aux honnetes gens, ou allons-nous, nom du vieux Dieu.&quot;Keanwhile a more legitimately political personage than Bolo has., at least for a moment, occupied the centre of the stae-e in this ^ama o  suspicion.     tir Leon toxdet, the editor of the Action ^ancaise,a son of Alphonse Daudet, has for some time been the leader
Df the Royalist press and has made himself into a kind of amateur public Prosecutor with a perpetual reiteration of &apos;Jraccuse&apos;.     He saw treaohery everywhere.     Not in Bolo indeed whose &quot;affaire&apos; he erroneously thought to be of the second order.     But in the Paeifist Bonnet Rouge gang, whom he had been denouncing long before Duval gad Almoreyda, whose guilt nobody now doubts, were actually arrested. He has now flown at higher game.     On Sept,  29th u correspondent, evidently in touch with Daudet and his friends wrote that their story was that the Bonnet Rouge group had sold military plans to Germany, and stirred up mutinies in the Army:   and that they had fceen paid not only by Germany but, amazing as it seemed, by the French Secret Service at the same timo, that is to say by M. Malvy, who would be shortly arrested.     A few days later Daudet, who had al-v/ays complained that he had supplied information to the Government about spies but that they hu3hed things up and did nothing, took the remarkable- course of addressing.a letter to the President of the Republic, accusing Malvy cf informing the Germans of the plan of attack at the Chemin des Dames, and of committing other infamous treacheries.     The letter was communicated by M. Painleve to M, Malvy who demanded that it should be read in the Chamber.     This was done on Oct. 4th, and H. Malvy made a passionate and powerful reply at ife end of which he fainted from overstrain.     He had on the whole a great sucaess, as members of popular Chambers replying to personal accusations practically always do.     But though he dealt in great detail with the Bonnet Rouge people and was supported by M. Briand &amp;a&amp; M. Viriani in his assertion that he cast them off as soon as their conduct became suspioious, he. did not explain why he retained his secretary, M. Leymarie, in offioe two months after he knew that it -vas Leymarie who gave the cheque back to Duval.     (leymarie, it may noted, is accused by Daudet of having shared in Malvy&apos;s treachery)
It seems clear that very few people even among Mal.vyfs opponents relieve in his guilt.     Hean^Mle, tho charges are being dealt with in the Courts Which, .as many, yf the best newspapers, and apparently !..;, Pzinlove himself, think, ia the sphere to which they should have been altogether loft.     The Chamber certainly gained nothing by the debate except the pleasures of excitement.     And the friends of II. Psinleve ;re somewhrt anxious as to its effect on his position. He is said to have been weak *ind unconvincing Ik Ms defence of the pr:rt played by tho War Office of which he- was then as nov7 head, in the business of the Duval cheque:   he seemed to the excited left lukewarm in his indignation againstftfcfe attacks on II. Llalvy:   and finally he allowed himself to be driven by the pressure of the Chamber and especially of M. Caillaux, who has had some experience of what press attacks can be and may have more in future, into promising to introduce at once a law for the better repression of newspaper slanders, a promise which he has already been obliged to withdraw in the faoe of the strong and nearly universal opposition of the press.     Almost the only exception ?/as M. Caillaux&apos; friend, Le Pays, which amusingly wished for no alteration in the lawr, (though nearly all the papers admit it to be unsatisfactory) except in the sole case of accusations of treason.&apos;   The result is that K. Painleve has lost some of the ground he had been rapidly /raining by the promptness with whioh his Government had defat with the various scandals since it took Office;    *s well as by the firmness end complete success with which they handled the. strike in the Aviation Factories, where the men insisted on stocking work in suite cf a decision by the Committee of Arbitration which they h?;d agreed tc accept.     They were told that if work w&amp;3 not resumed at once all mobilizeable men would at once be sent to the front and on their demanding a discussion of their grievances !&apos;. Lcucheur
refused to discuss anything till they had resumed work which they then did, saying they would accept the Minister18 interpretation of the arbitration.     To this success, attained without any use ef force, IK. Painleve pointed in the Malvy debate as proving the spirit of discipline and order which prevailed among the workmen and the power of the Government to govern without friction.     Most likely the firmness of the Government was helped tomits success by the patriotic desire of the men not to delay work of vital military importance. But most human actions are due to mixed motives and part of the mixture in this case was evidently fear of the action the Minister threatened to take if he were not obeyed.     It is notable that tho present Minister, M. Louchour who is a large employer found his weapon for stopping the strike in a decree ioeued by his predecessor, M. Thomas, the Socialist,If, Thomas is a man of will and vigour who was not afraid of de-cisions   when in Office and no?; has shown that he can practice the $ same courage in opposition.    For some time it has been known that, though for reasons which are still obscure, $e refused to take office when the present Ministry was formed, he has not altered his views about the permanent duty of national defense and was in favour sooner or later of the Socialist party again, taking a share in the Govern-ment.     He told the public in interviews and articles that in his view the Socialist party must no longer sacrifice efficiency to the shadow of party unity, and he talked privately to his friends of his intention to &quot;deliberately smash things up&quot;   at the party Conference at Bordeaux.     That Conference has just finished sitting and, though full reports are not yet available, it seems clear on the whole that he has aarried out his threat.     The original unity of the Socialist party has for a long time been little more than nominal.     Till the
return of the Socialist delegates from Russia active opposition was confined to two or three extremists who had defied their leaders and get German Socialists at Ilienthal.     But when those who had been to Russia came baok full of the Stockholm project, vaguely influenced by Russianism, no patched up compromises put into the form^of reso-jutions could long keep the party together.     There was too little oommon ground   between those who, like Thomas,, were for a&apos;victotye integrale&apos; and against a &apos;paix quelconque&apos; and the minority whose object was to begin discussing peace terms at once without being at all sure v/hat sort of peace it was to be.     Thomas had made great con-cessions to the minority.     Ho belongs to the Centre of the party which had accepted Stockholm and a plebiscite for Alsace, not to the Right which rejected both.     But he has lately seen that things had reached the parting *f the ways, and he went to Bordeaux to define the issue and, as he said, to divide the sheep from the goats.     The result has been that the Majority Resolution, the essential part of which demanded a more vigorous prosecution of the war and advocated the oo-operation of the Socialists in the work of National Defence, was carried by 1552 against some 1300 votes given for various Minority Resolutions, the principal of which made participation in the Ministry and even support of the warscredits dependent upon a number of conditions. The Eienghalian amendments, refusing credits and demanding immediate peace, mustered 503 votes between them out of the total of 2886. mis sounds at first a largeish number;   what it means when analysed is that in an assembly of the party which contains nearly all the Pacifists of Prance less than a fifth could be found to vote against the war-credits.     That does not look like any weakening of the national spirit as a whole.It is too early to say what the ultimate result will be.     The Majority Resolution, being drafted by U. Renaudel, who is before all
Itthings a man of words, was a very lengthy document, laying down a com-prehensive programme, which may or may not prove such as M. Painleve&apos; oan swallow, and on the other hand may or may not &quot;be insisted upon in detail by M. Thomas and his friends.     Probably in one way or another a way will be found for some of them to join the Ministry. 3ut in any case they have burnt their boats.    They have now publicly separated themselves from the Pacifist and international minority who, as M. Thomas said,still think in the midst cf war that the first business of   Socialists is to fight capitalism &quot;even at the risk of arriving at anarchy&quot;.     It seems as if the Minority must now be dis-solved:   part following the Kienthalians who will risk anything, even France, for the sake of Internationalism, and part M. Thomas who will risk everything, even Socialism, for the sake of - Prance.     7/e shall soon see.With regard to the constant demand for an extension of *ur front to which allusion was made in the last Report, we may note the sensible remark of the Victoire:-   &quot;whst the British Army is doing in front of Tpres is the best answer Jrhat can be made to the demands for the extension of the British front.&quot;     There has altogether been a ?ood deal of friendly allusion to this country in the French press of late, Mr. Asquith&apos;s speeches coming in for much favourable corn-sent, the English &apos;Union SacreV of all classes receiving high praise, yid the German slander that the war is being carried en for profit ceing held up to the contact it deservesThe question of Civil Control of the Army, which Lord Bertie Relieved to have been shelved by the opposition of General Petain, tas been settled by what seems to be an almost complete surrender to foe demands of the Chamber.     Nothing is plainer than that the French Government, which is in a much stronger position than ours in dealing &quot;ith Labour difficulties, is very much weaker in the face of Parliament
J.C.B.rliamentary control of the Army has been incessantly demanded peoially by the Radical and Socialist Left and they have got sub-ant ially what they asked.     It is1 true that those who axsst asked hat the 10 or 20 deputies who are to exercise it should do so without restrictions of any kind&quot;, must content themselves with eeing their delegates forbidden to touch military operations in any But otherwise their victory appears complete.     The control is fficially announced as &apos;general and permanent&apos; and as having no ther limitation than the one just mentioned.     no offiders are to ccompany the controllers except at their own request.     It must be upposed that General Petain found he could not resist and so accepted ith a good grace.     For the Pays, no friend to Generals, speoially Aanks the Grand Quartier General for having actively assisted in the rork by smoothing over difficulties.     But one may still wonder how it Fill work in practice.
