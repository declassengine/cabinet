From Viceroy, Foreign Department, IStli October 1917. (Repeated to Tehran.) (Received at India Office 1.1th at 11 a.m.)Secret. South Persia Rifles. Your telegram of the 20th. September last. A fresli solioino lias just been received from Sykes, aiid is under examination, it is therefore unnecessary to review scheme .referred to in your telegram. But in meantime we should be glad if His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider following general review of situation : Trend of our present policy is to create expensive and highly-organised mercenary armv under British officers in South Persia. This force, is apparently intensely distasteful both to Persian people and the Persian Government, and now presumably lacks original justification, that it is a counterpoise to similar Russian (? undertaking) in the north. The time has come when we must decide whether we are forcibly, and regardless of Persian opinion, to proceed with undertaking on proposed elaborate lines, or to modify it so as to conform more nearly to Persian opinion.As a war measure, South Persia Rifles promise to be of little or no value in the near future (vide Marling&apos;s telegrams, 203 F., 21st June, and 232 .F., 7th July). Indeed, in certain contingencies they might become a source of actual embarrassment and danger, especially with such modern armament.We recognise that the only hope for permanent tranquilisation of South Persia lies in the presence of a really efficient force under British officers, such as that now contemplated. But it is questionable whether tran-quilisation of South Persia is so urgently desirable as to warraat us in developing on too elaborate lines an undertaking calculated to strain our relations with Persia at a critical time. The solution of the question would appear to lie in some form of compromise, admitting of such increased Persianisalion of the force for the present as would render it tolerable and even acceptable to Persia. When the war is over we can reconsider position.Finally, it must be remembered that Persian Government could presumably never themselves meet the cost of elaborate organisation con-tern plated, and at end of war we should be confronted with the alternative either of down-grading Force, or of accepting a permanent and embarrassing burden of expenditure on its account.
