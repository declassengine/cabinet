V/This Document-olonel dcM- 0 0 f&apos;/v357REPORT from the MINISTRY of LABOUR on the LABOUR SITUATION .00 for the Week ending October 10th 1917.I. GENERAL REMARKS.Industrial tgrs of the IforTaTap; It at ioh Tnst Income Tax.Reports have been received frdm Scotland Yard which ihdi*, oate that the 1.7..&apos;. does not possess sufficient importance to warrant the somewhat violent press agitation at. present in progress. The organisation has been in existence in this country for many years and has never showed signs Of gaining ground. Its aotivities.. in view of the history of. the Society^in other countries,, require and are receiving attention, but at the present time its Influence is belivect to be small,, and there is some danger that the hostile advertisement which is now being afforded, may attract undue attention.   In this connection it is noteworthy that &quot;Forward&quot; sounds a note of warning, and expresses an earnest hope that any persecution of the I.--Y.7.- by the Government will be resented by the Labour Party as a fresh invasion of civil liberty.An agitation among Industrial Workers,, with the object of escaping&apos; Income tax altogether, or, if that prove impossible, of effecting an increa.se in the minimum limited of taxable income,, is proceeding in all indxistrlal centres.-   Liability ef the wage earning class for Income Tax was mentioned as one of the general causes of Unrest, by the Commissioners for 7ales and for Scotlana.&quot;The matter has also been.brought to notice in the Labour Report of this Ministry..on previous occasions (e ,gV September T9th, p .5&apos;, September 26th pp. 4 and 5) Opposition to the Tax has shewn signs, of bencm&amp;ng general.   In the Clyde area the question is said to be more acute than the demand for an increase of. 100-&apos; in wages,, and the members of the A.S.E.. are joining; the Miners in their hostile agitation.-In South Wales opposition is most marked.   Following on the interview between the Chancellor of the-Exchequer and the South Wales Miners Federation, aon 30th September, at a meeting of the men at the Cambrain Collieries, Olydach,. it was decided to refuse to pay the Tax, &apos; peno&apos;ing the decision of a Conference of all South ?/ales Lodges,, to be held On 8th October.   That Conference has been held, and it Is reported that a resolution was passed that no .income tax should be levied on workmen&apos;s wages, however liberal those wap-es might be..Prom Barrow it was reported that all income tax papers received by&apos;&apos;-the members&apos; of the A..S.E. had been oollected and returnee&apos; uncompleted to the Collector of Taxes.-   Information has however since been received that the Shop Stewards have been interviewed by the Surveyor of Taxes and that- the forms are now again distributed and will be filled; in.^n Coventry the Brassworkers unanimously refused tor-pay until summoned,, and&apos;other section of the workers are determined&apos; to evade payment,. except on..incomes exceeding  200 per annum.At Newcastle a number of prosecutions were instituted for non-payment.  &quot;On^Sth September a meet ing. of the N.U.R. resolves that incomes less than  160 should be exempt, TRfciak a branch of the A.3.E. called upon the Executive o.f that Society to support the&quot;action taken by the.Miners.In Yorkshire, in Nottingham and i.n Birmingham feeling is stated to Fe acute,. whTle at Liverpool ifrie eyes of the workmen are turned to Barro   and to SoirFh .7ales for a lead, and the matter is expected to form part of the general movement to improve.the wages earners1 position, which is expected this month., .The method of collection does not generally give rise to criticism,, but in Yorkshire, complaints arc mad-.; that the whole of a quarters impost- is collected from the wages of one
one or two weeks.The arguments used by the agitators arc based generally on the allegation that the present rates of wages have been determined by the rise in the cost of living, that the increased remuneration is already inadequate to meet that rise and that payment of tho Tax tends still further to reduce the standard of living.    It is also pointed out that, as the purchasing never of the sovereign is now only half what.it was before the War, the exemption limit-.-... actually represents a pre-war sum of  60.    In some quarters an additional point, is made of the fact thsfc  the Tax falls chiefly on earnings from overtime.The question is a serious one, not only on account of the widespread nature of the agitation, but - it is one in which tho discontented in all industries ,have a octcon interest.   It is however probable that the concession of an additional exer-otion of ?,85 for wivct., announced in the Press of the 8th instant, will remove the sting from the- agitation.   There are indications that this measure of relief will go far to reconcile the inarriod men to the reduction of the. limit of exemption in the case of their bachelor fellow workers; but it will bo necessary to wait a little longer before the effect, of the concession can be judged.
II..   PRESS OPINIONS.8 &quot;Perment The series of articles in the &quot;Times&quot; on the1 subject of&quot;&quot; Revolution has formed the subject of frequent and hostileolution.&quot; comment in the Daily and Labour Press.. The general impression :    &quot; received from the commentary is that the &quot;Tines&quot; has presenteda valuable weapon to those who preach;that Capital is plotting against the freedom of Labour, though the apparent anxiety of Mr. Snowclen and Mr. Jowett to assume their readers that&apos; they are innocent of any &quot;revolutionary&quot; aims iin. the violent sense of&apos; the word) sugrests that they see $he danger of their present course... &apos;The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (October. 3rd) printed an article from the pen of Mr, J.H. Thomas, in. the course of which he writes;-   &quot;I am going to assert that the &quot;Times? correspond-&quot;ent!s bogey of the revolutionary ferment is a complete &quot;delusion, that the Labour movement is not dominated by any &quot;conscious revolutionaries, an-1 that the demands during the &quot;war have been moderate, and, in fact., a- truce has been observed, &quot;and no important section of the workers.have improved their&quot;standard of life.......There is a feeling among the workers&quot;that they should never return to the pre-war standard of life; &quot;the spirit is broadcast that the &quot;common people should have &quot;healthier, happier&apos;and more comfortable surroundings.   But m&apos;this is the honest aspiration of the people themselves as a &quot;whole,......That there are men in our ranks who are deeply ,&quot;dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs is true.   But&quot;these years of war experience........have at last demonstrated&quot;a love of country and a sense of patriotism that, amidst all &quot;the horrors of war one cannot help but admire,...&quot;   In its leader on the subject on 4th October, the same paper points out the encouragement which e,rticles such as those published by the &quot;Times&quot; cannot but afford to the German people.   The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; discusses the policy of the National Guilds League and says-.-   &quot;That all this is of the nature of &quot;a revolutionary movement we may admit, but we do not share, &quot;the alarm of the writer in the &quot;Times&quot; because we take it to &quot;be the expression of a very small handful of academic people, &quot;deriving only spasmodic support from the current tendency &quot;of Trade Unions to revolt&apos; against their own leaders and sub-&quot;stitute the authority of the Shop Stewards,   An anarchic &quot;movement of such a type may give trouble, but in the long run &quot;is far more dangerous to its own side, than to its opponents&quot;,.....,*,*..&quot;   The &quot;New Age&quot; comments on the articles as&quot;follows&quot;It is not by any means our wish to deny that a revolutionary&quot;feeling is abroad nor that it is. increasing in intensity and&quot;in- quantity;   but we deny that it has as yet either the&quot;character or the dimensions ascribed to it by the writer in&quot;the &quot;Times&quot;, On the Contrary, it is at present so small as not&quot;only to be negligible&apos;, but,&apos;still more important, as to make&quot;negligible the &quot;antidote&quot;,   which the &quot;Times&quot; writer is good&quot;enough to say is:National Guilds.&quot;The &quot;Laxly Telegraph&quot;- in a very reasonable article fromits Labour correspondent on the spirit of revolution describes\ the revolutionaryparty as a negligible faction&apos; and themovement generally as discredited.   The &quot;New Statesman&quot;publishes a leader under the title &quot;The Rich ManTs barrage&quot;suggesting that the Times1 articles are a barrage, put upby the. richer portion of the population in order to defendcapital from any attacks upon it in the form of a war levy,.In the &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; there is an article by Mr. BertrandRussell which contains the following:-   &quot;Lest we shouldI &quot;think that they are merely the personal opinion of the writer,&quot;they were introduced by a leading article calling attention&quot;to the weighty nature of what they had to say. i3. ; ,&apos;   , /There
&quot;There can be no doubt that Lord llortheliffe is behind,them, &quot;and hitherto, since the war&quot;began, his wishes hare been law. &quot;We are forced to conclude that he considers the noment pro*-&quot;pitious lor a first class&apos; struggle between Capital and &quot;Labour&quot;.   It suggests that the moment is opportune as the hands of Labour are tied by patriotism.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; deals with the &quot;Times&quot; in an article headed ^Terror In the Times - a hint of Civil 17ar&quot;.   The following extract is from the last paragraph.   &quot;He seems to &quot;be something of a Revolutionist himself in his own way, and &quot;in this last article he begins to ferment ,   Ho is eager for &quot;the contest,   A struggle be two on tho IJatidh and Labour must &quot;come sooner or later, and he doesn&apos;t Wish to minimise the &quot;danger........The really interesting question, however, is,&quot;will the Times correspondent be prosecuted under one Of the &quot;Acts he loves so well for &quot;causing disaffection&quot; and asking &quot;for Civil War?   The answer is, he is on the side of the &quot;Capitalists and all that he does he does with pattiotic &quot;motives&quot;,In the same paper Mr, Snowden castigates the Times for their &quot;remarkable but mischievous series&quot;of articles&quot;, whose objects he describes to be&quot;clearly to arouse a spirit of&quot;hatred a,gainst the organised Labour movement.......His&quot;slanders.Of the workers in the Trade Unions are mean and&quot;disgraceful.......A11 this wicked misrepresentation of&quot;millions of the working classes who have made tremendous &quot;sacrifices in life and effort is done with a deliberate &quot;purpose.   It is to accentuate, class differences, to rouse the &quot;middle and upper classes to. energy, to prevent democracy from &quot;exercising power and authority in.the State.&quot;The &quot;Herald&quot; deals with the matter at great length, under the heading &quot;Northcliffe declares Civil War on Labour&quot;, the object of the article being to call upon Labour to combine and organise efficiently to withstand the, threatened capitalist onslaught.   The following are extracts:--&apos; &quot;Our reply to the . &quot;Times,....is that there is Indeed a revolutionary ferment in&quot;the ranks of Labour; but that it is very far from being of &quot;the. character described..The movement of revolt in Fthe ranks of Labour has its foundation in two things - in the &quot;organised consciousness of,the possibility of a better social &quot;order.........and in the deep seated acid positive discontent&quot;with the existing order, which prevails not only among the &quot;rank and file of Labour, but throughout every democratic &quot;section of the community&quot;.    In the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; Mr,F. W.- Jowett discusses these articles, which &quot;appear to have &quot;been written by a respectable old gentleman, whose name, has, &quot;been frequently mentioned&quot;.   He concludes:-   &quot;probably the.; &quot;scheme has: influential backing in high capitalist.circles,, &quot;and has also the approval of some of the highly pla,ced&apos; &quot;bureaucrats of Whitehall.    The latter - the -Thitehall &quot;bureaucrats - are, I am told, in a state bordering on panic, &quot;at present through fear of a struggle with organised Labour.&quot;The aims arid policy of Sir Auckland Geddes are discussed by Mr.V/.N. Ewer in the &quot;Herald&quot;.   He anticipates&apos; that the .. National Service Minister &quot;will either organise a &quot;big-, new comb out&quot;-, or attempt to organise the whole industry of the nation   in accordance with the needs of the movement.   In both cases.failure is promised.    &quot;A new conb-out must, if it &quot;is to produce any appreciable result, be largely a comb-out in munitions, shipbuilding, mining, transport and agriculture. If it succeads tho result will be disastrous.   Even the mere attempt&quot;will bo serious.;  And Sir Auckland will very soon oone to realise labour problems of which he probably thinks very little today./As
&quot;As to the other alternative, quite as certainly, under &quot;capitalistic methods of industrial organisation, their&quot;endeavour will result in hopeless and total failure.........&quot;Capitalist Governments cannot organise effectively for war, &quot;because the workers cannot trust Capital Governments&quot;.The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; writes:    &quot;The statement of &quot;Sir. A.C. Geddes not only ridicules the scrapping of Mr. &quot;Chamberlains scheme, but foreshadows the setting up of another &quot;vast network &apos;of departments, sub-departments, committees and &quot;sub-committees to deal with the problems, of such appalling &quot;dimensions as to make us shiver with the thought of the &quot;cost to the nation.   Our army of State officials will soon &quot;vie in numbers with that of the army, in the field......&quot;&quot;Muddle&quot; is scarcely a word strong enough to describe such &quot;vacillation in policies.&quot;d The &quot;Herald writes: &quot;The prices intthe various markettrol.       &quot;places appear to be hardening in regard to foodstuffs not yet &quot;entirely under control, with the drop in the price of bread, &quot;has Come the increase in the price of potatoes, and in the &quot;East End the price in many places is not less than Id per lb. &quot;Control Committees appear to have precious little to do with &quot;actually controlling prices,    In many places these committees &quot;are really controlled by shopkeepers and wholesale dealers&quot;.ttoh&apos; Writing on the &quot;first week under the Control scheme&quot; thentrol.        &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; says:-   &quot;There is still much complaint &quot;at the smallness of the grants, which means great hardship in &quot;thousands of homes.   Several spinners1 branches&apos;are calling &quot;for the payment.of out-of-work benefit by the Unions,   In &quot;one way &quot;the scheme is working to the advantage of the Unions. &quot;It is giving the officials a good opportunity to enlist the &quot;non-unionists, and many of them are making/use of it0&quot;goodal The increase in Miners1 wages is generally admitted tontrol.        be satisfactory, and the new flat rate advance has been welcomed/almost all quarters.   The &quot;Hersald7s&quot; comment is significant.    &quot;The advance.....will inevitably be the signal &quot;for a big new crop of wage demands.   Railwayman, munition &quot;workers, transport workers, and others cannot be given less &quot;than the miners have received.&quot;   The &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; writes on this subject:-   &quot;There will naturally be some grumbling &quot;amongst the best paid men, but, on the whole, it is safe to, &quot;say that the new principle will be recognised as a just one &quot;.....It will further have the salutary effect of breaking &quot;down in some measure, the grade barrier that has done so &quot;much to prevent that perfect unity so necessary to working &quot;class success0&quot;tour The Advisory Committees as now constituted are generallychanges.     welcomed, and form &apos;che subject of special articles in the &quot;Iron and Coal Trades Review&quot;, the &quot;Cotton&apos;Factory Times&quot; the &quot;Local Government Chronicle-,&quot;, and &quot;Reynolds&apos; F/eekly Newspaper&quot; during the week.
Reconstruction, The Railway Review deals with the subject in a thon^hlnraX **-&quot; article^ &quot;Consider the future&quot;, in the &quot;couree of whichit saysi-   &quot;The question of industrial peace-during cud &quot;after the war continues a prohler. not yet approaching &quot;resolution,....A quarrel betv/een a body of wage workers &quot;and an employer is not how a personal affair, in which &quot;none other is presumed to have interest, while a &quot;quarrel promptly attracts the attention of the &quot;controllers of the State, and State machinery is set at &quot;work to settle the difficulty,,..iThe industrial and &quot;political are so interunited that they are becoming one &quot;factor,,,,,A11 the evidence bears witness to the fact th &quot;that there will be no Reversion in the position of &quot;railways and that they will continue to be under &quot;definite state control,..,The divine right of Kings and &quot;lords has been abolished, and the divine right of &quot;capital to &quot;do ae it likes with its own&quot; is passing &quot;rapidly into dissolution.   The state in its necessity &quot;has broken individual rights, and the factor of &quot;production is altered,&quot;The Hero,la reports&quot;c6nsiderable activity on the &quot;.7hitley rifrbni1&apos;, and, referring to the schemes of Dockers, Stone MasCns, Boot and Shoe operatives, Printing Trades and Postal Unions on the direction of Industrial Parliaments, remarks:-   &quot;This activity does not surprise us; for we &quot;have always seen that the real difficulty will arise &quot;when the attempt is made to frame in detail any actual &quot;schore, and, still more, when any actual scheme, and, &quot;still more, when any actual scheme is put into effect,&quot;eaoe movements.    Forward comments on the organized opposition to pacifistmeetings and suggest that these are due to capitalist support - It says,-&quot;It shows that the war-at-any-price &quot;people are getting very angry.   In other words that the; &quot;are afraid. Afraid of the growing strength of the peace &quot;movement.... ,Are they afraid that the men 7/ho have been &quot;fighting for their country will oorie back to look for &quot;thatcountry?   Are they afraid that when these men &quot;eWme back to their native country and realize that the &quot;men in possession are the Buccleuchs and the Breadal-&quot;bones and the V/estminsters and the Bedfdrds and the &quot;Derbys and the Hungry Haniltons and their rent-drawing &quot;kith and kin, they will object and begin to demand the &quot;fruits of victory.&quot;,,,,, It almost seems as if the day of Peace will be a &quot;bad dfay for the monopolists.   Bo wonder they want to &quot;postpone it,&quot;The Herald discusses the possibility of auction of the Government to repress pacifist propaganda, &quot;Robert Sniliie speaking at Glasgow on Saturday last &quot;warned the Cabinet and all concerned that any attempt &quot;to resort to repressive and coercive measures against &quot;the men and women who are advoaating- a negotiated and &quot;honourable peace would bo likely to lead to very &quot;serious trouble in the labour world...,Organized &quot;Labour claims the right to agitate and organize in a &quot;constitutional manner to change Governments -and Laws, &quot;and with this right will not allow any Government or &quot; ress campaign to 1 interfere,..,In this country it is &quot;the bounden Duty of organized Labour to follow the &quot;advice of Robert Smillie and in order to be effective &quot;take action to secure without further delay, a Labour &quot;Government&quot;,In the same journal, Ilr.

Enough of the people1s bloou is shedo&quot;The Leeds ,/eokly Citizen reports a meeting of the 7ononr8 Peace Crusade at Loeds, where &quot;a perfectly orderly end &quot;attentive crowd of  1 &quot;a thousand people in Victoria Square&quot; listened to speeches by Lrse &quot;Jillian Harvey, Hiss Theodora l/iison /ilson and other pacifists* &quot;The I &quot;meeting adopted the resolution by a huge show of hands, end a &quot;collection of over  7 was taken up.&quot;On the other hand the war spirit has been more in evidence during: the week than is usually the ceso.   Tho Yorkshire Post quotes extracts from the Report for 1915-1916 presented to the Yorkshire Liners1 Association, (originally printed for private circulation but now made public), whioh include tho following.-   &quot;They have got tho word in &quot;Germany from the so colled British working men, who seem to bo &quot;oagerly engaged in working for tho enemy - &quot;hold out I we will tire &quot;the British workers and the British public of this war: we will give j &quot;you another ohance, we will look over all the massacres and all the &quot;dovilment you have been guilty of during this war: we will shake &quot;hands v/ith you and make  Si-ends with you and make it so that you can &quot;enter upon another war in another fifteen or twenty years, that will &quot;be more successfulyfsSr you than this has been,&quot;The British Citizen quotes the answer sent by the secretary of the Blackburn &quot;Jeavers Protection Society (This Society is not pert of the /savers Amalgamation) to a letter from Lr. PhiliprSnowden on the subject of the treatment of the Conscientious Objecters at Dartmoor,   Thvt answer is as follows:- &quot;Thanks lor circular and &quot;pamphlet duly received. I placed the natter before my committee end &quot;the following was unanimously decided,&quot;1. That the treatment accorded to &quot;0.0*a&quot; Is much too lenient and gentle.That the &quot;C.Ors&quot; hive no moral right to existence prolonged by food procured by the militarist protection of our fleet.&quot;3, Th t all &quot;0*0&apos;s&quot; should be disfranchised permanently and refused all access to our Courts of Law,

The housing problem continues to rocoive aconsiderable amount of attention.    Tho Government housing scheme for rural bousing is attacked by the &quot;Call&quot; which describes tho scheme as &quot;of tho usual patchwork character &quot;which is typical of all the reforms that are introduced &quot;by capitalist Governments.&quot;   Beferring to the report that the Government would grant subsidies to landlords for the purpose of building cottages, the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; writes:-   &quot;After our experience with the Laws of Oornland &quot;Subsidy Act the surest ion of subsidised cottages for &quot;the said landlords1 labourers needs, matching. If the &quot;State build3^ or even subsidises building, the State &quot;should own the land and cottages when built. Otherwise &quot;the widest possible road to the ugliest sort of &quot;corruption in politics seems opened.&quot;Reports of meetings dealing with the housing problem are-published from Hexham, Cupar, Halifax, Wrexham, Gloucester, Birkenhead, Concott,- Devrobury, Rosyth, Sheffield, and Hartlepool.
III. DISTRICT RIIPORTS.Lonfion. Except possibly at Woolwich the general position in&quot;&quot;&quot; the London area is normal.   At ;/oolwich the discontent ofday workers with their rates of pay is becoming acute, and many of the most highly skilled workers are said to have expressed the intention of throwing up their present work for unskilled work as soon as they may lawfully do so.There was some repetition of tho disorderly scenes of June last at the Brotherhood Church, Southgate on Sunday. The occasion was a Pacifist meeting which was to have boon addressed by Mr, Bertrand Russel.   Tho prompt intervention of the police prevented the affair from becoming serious, though a slight fire which occurred gave the Press an opportunity of devoting largo headlines to an otherwise trivial episode.Pinsbury Park continues to be the chiof centre of pacifist agination and it is reported that, so lorn- has the movement been unchecked, the Meetings of the i.?ar Aims Committee in the neighbourhood are attaining but scant success.South v/estern In tho dockyards round Southampton the withdrawalArea. of leaving certificates is being hailed with intensesatisfaction, and the proposal to grant subsistence allowances to men who enrol themselves as ..ar Munition Volunteers, is expected locally to counteract such discontent as exists.V/ost Midlands The position is on. the &quot;whole satisfactory in thisarea. There has been however a ^ooc&apos; real of grumbling on various points, notably the incidence of Income Tax; it is not yet known how the recent statement issued by the Board of Inland Revenue will be received.At the meeting of the South Staffordshire minors at which the Coal Controllers wages offer was accepted&apos; the opinion was expressed that it was only patriotism which had persuaded the exocutivo to reduce their original demands, it was also stated that the Coed. Controller had givon a guarantee that foot5 prices should be brought  own by 10,:..Considerable discontent has boen expressed in Birmingham at the attitude of tho local police.. Prominent men In&apos; the Labour movement are said to have been shadowed by detectives who have taken notos of all that has boon said.   In addition a meeting of operative bakers, held in regard to the national demand for a cessation of night work, has bsen forbidden.,Yorkshire andjast Midlands The situation is fairly ruiet, save for the&quot;&quot;&quot;^Important agitation among tho wsdiilen workers for an increase in wages.Important meetings of railw&amp;ymon have been held. At these the opinion most commonly expressed has been that the ambitious demands which have recently boon put forward oanuot be obtained during the war.   After the war however it will be a different matter and the executive of the National Union of R.,ilwaymen is beint pressed to formulate
a neT -programme on national as opposed to sectional lines. The chiefSoint is to he the eight hours day and it is pointed out that Lord Leverhulme recently gave his opinion in favour of a six hours day.Meetings held by the War Aims Committee in Yorkshire are meeting with success.   The audiences are reported to be large, attentive and sympathetic.   It would appear that the opinion of Labour in this district with regard to the War is still quite sound.Western The chief centre of unrest in this area is theMersey.   The Engineers are expressing great anriiety as regards the next award of the Committee on Production. It is said locally thc.t if anything loss than 5/- is conceded the men will come out.   The Boilermakers are not waiting for the award before giving trouble however. Their grievance is the discharge of Porsythe, a well-known agitator, from the employment of Messrs. Glover Clayton.   The men have passed a resolution to down tools if their demand for his reinstatement is not acceded to.At Barrow thero is said to be some discontent at the proposal to adopt an extensive billeting scheme the fear being that it will not be applied to the well-to-do classes.   Gratification is however expressed at the prompt measures that have been taken by the Ministry of Munitions to remedy the notorious shortage of housing.The agitation amon^: the railwaymen seems to be making headway in this area.   Cre* e, Preston and Carlisle are stated to be the centres where it is most evident.The v/omen&apos;s Peace Crusade is particularly aotive in Lancashire,;of r:hich county some of its leading spirits are natives.   It claims to be meeting with considerable success and its attempt to play upon the feelings of the soldiers through the natural affection of their womenfolk for thorn must be regarded as possibly the most insidious form of pacifist propaganda now being employed.Eastern .. Here as elsewhere the chief topic of discussionhas been the Income Tax.    It is hoped however that the statement issued on Monday will have a good effect.A national &quot;rank and file&quot; conference of engineer-ing and&apos; shipbuilding trades is to be held in Hev castle during the coming weekend.Conditions are normal.A Spocial conference of the South Wales Miners1 Federation was hold at Cardiff on the 8th to consider the recommendation of the executive of the Minors1 federation of Great Britain that its constituent bodies should assist the Government in recruiting persons of military age who have entered tho mines since the outbreak of the war.. After ^ome^disnussion a short resolution was  ^ssed to the followinf&quot;e*r^i- &quot;that we take no part in assisting in the recruitment o*pcIliery workers for the army.,&quot;Amon-j- the railway workers the efforts of tho Vigilance Committees do not seem to be achieving much success,    The majority of the men boins; apparently of the opinion th,.t they will *.ain more after tho war by honourably
observing the truce, than by attempts to make uso of the country1^ needs at the /resent juncture. It is os/ecially among the men on the mineral traffic linos that tho agitation is making itself felt.A special effort is being made under the auspices of the Central Labour College to push forward educational work in South Wales during the coming winter. Ovor a hundrod. classes are said, to have been started during the past few weeks in this district.   This movement is importar.it as the teaching is as a rule cf a definitely revolutionary and syndicalist character, and it is from the ranks of the students that the majority of the younger school of agitators are drawn.Scotland. The failure of the Ironmouldcrs strike, onwhioh the local extremists wore apparently relying for a success, has had a considerable effect in the -.7est of Scotland.   Thore is. it is true, unrest among all classes in the Shipbuilding and Engineering industries, but it is not considered, probable that any so:-.ious trouble will arise before the forthcoming award by -jho Committee on Production, which is being awaited with anxiety by tho men.Considerable rivalry exists between tho Industrial Workers of Sreat Britain, which has been increasing its membership, and the Clyde VJorkeru Committee which has lost orestige over the Ironmoulders1 strike. The latter is about to embark on a vigorous policy, with the object of restoring its waning influence.
51   0 0IT   strikesThere was a general resumption of work among the Scottish I^onmoulders   on Thursday, October 4th and the position is for the moment quiet.The most important strike of the week was a sectional affair bf 500\ seamen and firemen afe Liverpool,   $hey refused to sign on for &quot;their various shipsunless their wages were first inafeased from  8 to  12 per.month.   This caused a delay to shipping in the district, but the strike movement never had time to become more than a local affair, owing to the prompt action of the Shipping Conofrbller, who oh Friday last announced an interim national award of  11 per month for seamen and  ll-10-0for firemen.   It 1$ expected that this concession will prove generally acceptable.   Apart from ite importance as relating to a branoh of Labour whioh is peculiarly essential at the  resent juncture, this award kke au additional significance as a further development of the policy of issuing Nrtional Awards.   If jSme system of co-ordinating a national award issued in one industry With those which have already been issued in other industries could be initiated much jealousy of one industry towards cnother would be $vetted and a notable cause of unrest removed.In the lietsl Engineering and Shjlahuildin^ Industry a number of strikes haveoccurred, rio one of whibh has any particular iffipcrtance, but representing in the aggregate a serious stoppage of work.   A oaso &amp;t Sunderland where there was a short cessation Of work about d fortnight ago among the Engineers eoipleyed in the shipbuilding yards on the Weir is of interest ,   The ndn have been paid 5d per day less than those engaged on Binil&amp;r work on the Tyne.   Negotiations on this point have been proceeding &quot;between the AiaS.B.and the Employers for the post eighteen months.   Eventually the nan took the matter into their own hands, with the result that their demand for an additional 5d was at once granted.   Suoh cases, whioh illustrate the powerlessnebs of the Unions, at once Ju&amp;tif5r, and prove an incentive to, unofficial action on the part if the men.IRaritW: stsiieft have been iri prtgress in the Coalmining Industry, but have been successfully settled.The Coal Controller has taken the advice Of the law officers of the Crown in regard to the complicated points in dispute at the Gwaun-oae-Gurwan Colliery.   They have after some hesitation given their1 opinion in favour oi the .iaenvB&apos; contention.   It is hoped that this decision will avert the trouble whioh has threatened to bedome general in the anthracite district.   Considerable sympathy has been expressed with the men at Gwausi-oaeMJurwen, as the  have bow been idle for two months and nany of thoin are half starvingi   3!ho looal shopkeepers have been forced to grant extensive credit under threats ef personal violence.In the Irish Linen Industry Mr. Vesey Knox K.C, the arbitrator appointed by the iiihistry of Labour, heard the case in dispute at Belfast on October 5th.   The employers have maintained their intractable attitude however and were not represented at the proceedings.   It remains to bo seon whether they will refuse to carry out tho award.The strike of garment 7/orkers at Ilessre RT.rt &amp; Lovy, Leicester, continues, though the strikers are being rapidly replaced by other workers.The protracted dispute between the operrtive and raster Bakers led to stopp; gos of work, though suoh stoppages cro so far sectional. There does not appe-r to be muoh prospect of tho difficulty being quickly settled.The total number of strikes reported by the Lrbour Statistics Department a8^ having been in progress during the week has risou from (49 as reported last week)to 57.
The : Shipyard Labour Department repoi^ts no lees than 149 cases of dispute as having been in progress during the week.   This increase in numbers would appear to be chiefly due to unrest on the Clyde where 92 oases are reported.   Of the total number 55 have been successfully settled and 11 have led to stoppages of work.-The oasaisee of these disputes, are of a very varied nature and suggest that there is growing unrest among all classes occupied in the shipbuilding industry.   On the other hand it appears that when their complaints&apos;are dealt with expeditiously by officers of the Department the men as a rule adopt a reasonable attitude and return to work.   It is unfortunate that the impression is growing among th^ uon that tho best way- of drawing attention to their grievances is to strike.The War Offioe Contracts Department reports 10 oases of dispute, only two of which however have originated during the week.   Of theso the most interesting case is that of the leather workers in the Liverpool district, whoso Union is, putting forward a series of demands which include lOCfl- increase on pre-war rates for piece workers.   The movement for the 100^ increasee would appear to bo spreading and is apparently based on the fact that fodd prices have increased roughly to that extent.The movement among textile workers (wool) in England and Scotland for increased waees Is coming to a head.   A meeting of all the Unions affected.,in Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands, representing 140,000 workers was held on September 29th and decided to make an application for a further advance in wages.It is understood that in Scotland the parties have agreed to refer the application to arbitration.The Coal (Controller reports that instructions have been sent out to all Colliery owners&apos;regarding the payment of the advance conceded to the Miners1 Pe&amp;eraticno   As a result of this increase the position throughout the Coalmining industry appears to be much quieter.The ministry of Munitions reports 15 cases of dispute as having teen in progress &quot;&quot;during the past week.   Of these * 7 have been settled, not however, before in 5 of the cases a stoppage of work had occurred.Several of these cases of dispute have arisen owing to tho refusal of the workmen to accept awards. . Among Individual cases which deserve notice may be mentioned trouble which has occurred at Messrs Armstrong ./hitworth at Manchester, Shiefly owing to a demand for a 25;&apos; increase in wapes.   At this firm no less than eight departments are affected but the Chief Investigation Officer reports that numerous other firms in the Manchester area ere affected.    These demands seen to have caused the employers to take a favourable view of payment by results . s c rome-dy and the Ministry of Munitions has been &quot;bombarded by requests from employers for assistance&quot; in initiating that system of. payment.An important dispute at Llanelly has led to u meeting of the Employers&apos; Association and the Trades Unions concerned , and it has been agreed that the former Society should adopt the wages and advances of the &apos;./elsh Tinplate Association ana follow the terms of the Titolate Arcrco ent,
jv370This is significant of a growing movement among the Unions which has as its object the arrangement of uniform rates throughout any given district, or even the extension of such a 3yston to the whole of the industry in the country.The Committee on Production during the past week has heard 13 cases, 11 in London, 1 in Manchester and 1 in Liverpool. Of these one effected members of the A.S.E.employed by various railway companies in Ireland,,   The object of the application was to obtain a rise in wages which would bring the level up to that obtaining among the employees of the Dublin Engineers Employers1 Association.MINISTRY OP LABOUR.D.
