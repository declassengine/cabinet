They themselves would suggest that the number should not exceed eight or ten.They venture to urge that you should be kind enough to fix as early a date as possible for receiving the Deputation if you will be good enough to consent to do so, as in their opinion it is a matter. e.f vital importance and of great urgency.; I beg to enclose a Memorandum embodying the principal points which the Deputation wish to bring before you.I have the honour to- remain,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)

MMORANDTO ,ON..THE. ATIOxT^PJ&apos;^OOMMBSRCi AD; THBIATXES,Tho Federation of British Industries, representing a vary largo proportion of tho manufacturing interests of this Country, views with deep concern the Commercial Treaty Position of th* United Kingdom and of tho Empire generally. They desire to present observations on this vital matter from the point cf view (l) of tho reconstruction of British Industry aft-r the War (2) cf thy organisation end ccnsolid-ation of tha Empire as a whole which are so essential to the well-being of every pert of it (3)  of the effect which the clearing away of the. present position would most probably have on the actual duration of the War,(1)     With regard to the first point they would call most earnest attention to the fact that the advantages which it is usually assumed that British Industry derives from most-favoured-nation treaties are illusory,  or very nearly so.   Tho popular supposition is that undor the most-favoured-nation clause the United Kingdom receives automatically tho most favourable treatment accorded to-any oth-.-r country: but,  although the letter of the treaty lends support to this idea, the actual working often shows     juito opposite results,.   Moreover tho British interpretation of the clause is not even universally admitted by other countries,  tho United States,  for instance only granting concessions to countries according compensatory concessions.; In such a case &quot;as this
the United Kingdom is clearly at a disadvantage.   By the adoption of specific rather than ad. valorem duties tariffs have, in effect, become specialised, and the United Kingdom therefore finds it difficult, if not impossible, to secure real concessions ,      Foreign nations are thus able to negotiate treaties quite satisfactory to themselves respectively; but when the United Kingdom comes in for, its share of good things it is left, as Mr. Runciman,- adverting to the last tariff arrangements between Russia and Germany, stated-in the Abuse of Commons on January IOth, 1916, &quot;with a very low tariff on things.which did not matter to us and a fairly high tariff on some things which did matter to us.&quot; .The Federation of British Industries considers that, as representing the great Manufacturing interests of this Country, it has every right to demand that this state cf . things should be remedied .   It cannot but remember with considerable resentment the constant reproaches levelled at British Manufacturers for want of energy or reluctance to adopt modern methods , whereas the giant strides made by Germany and other countries relatively to British Trade during recent years previous to the War were largely due to the condition of affairs described above ..   , It has required all the energy and resource of British Manufacturers to maintain the position they have against such signal disadvantages.The first step to be taken to rectify the position is to denounce all commercial treaties immediately in order that there may be a clean slate on which may be written the fundemental conditions for the development of British Industry in the future . -
2.        Under existing conditions the Overseas Dominions may he included in or excluded from new commercial treaties negotiated by the United Kingdom at their option.     It natur-ally follows that, unless a system of Imperial Co-operation be adopted, the various portions of the Empire will negotiate treaties on thoir -own account and to what they consider to the best of their individual advantage, without any reference to the common advantage of the Empire considorod as a whole. Under such circumstances the commercial disintegration oftho Empire must speedily follow, and that means inevitablyjthe political disintegration of the Empire also.&quot;Trade follows the flag&quot; is a fine phrase, but a phrase only:   it is nothing but a delusion when the continuation is permitted of conditions which are flagrantly in conflict with the development of the Nation - and the British Empire is a congeries of Nations - over which the flag flies. Sentiment goes far;   but the instincts of self-preservation and self-development go much farther, and it would be sad indeed if action by the British Government were so delayed that, in spite of the wonderful opportunities created by the War-, thoir declared policy of making the British Empire as far as possible independent of foreign supplies v/ere to be rendered nugatory.     This may be said to be a matter of high policy, but the Federation of British Industries submits that it is one on which   Its voice must be attentively heard, for the policy of a country is founded,, ultimately, on economics, and economics are founded on industry.Moreover the presentation of a united British Empire front in the negotiation of future commercial treaties is not only a condition indispensable to the consolidation of the
Empire, Put also &amp;ne affording an immense accretion of strength for obtaining concessions advantageous to the trade Interests of the Empire as a whole.     In fact matters havo reschod such a stage that unless this be the course adopted the Overseas Possessions will certainly not abandon the power of independent negotiation of treaties, and tho immense reciprocal markets of rapidly increasing importance within the Empire must definitely be lost to it to the irremediable loss of all its component parts - a result v/hich must ultimately bo disastrous to the Mother Country,Ho system of joint negotiation csa be created without the denunciation of present commercial treaties, and again the Federation of British Industries urge upon His Majesty1s Government the necessity of taking this course without a moment1s delay,3.        So far as can be judged from German orators, economists, and publicists the German nation is fed and strengthened by the Idoa - constantly repeated in various forms - that although the War cannot now be won in the military sense preached and believed in Germany when it caused it to break out, the World conditions will be such when Peace is concluded that that nation will rapidly recover its economic strength, and that by the &quot;Central Europe&quot; combination, it will establish an economic world ascendancy over its present enemies, so that if indeed Germany will not have wen the War, she will &quot;win the Peace&quot;..      At the root of all this argumentation is the fundamental belief that the United kingdom will never alter its present commercial policy, and that future commercial relations will be governed by the existing British interpretation, with all its weaknesses and failings, of the most-favoured-nation clause.
If this ground were knocked from under the feet of German commerciali?ts and financiers, they would at once  realise that all their dreams of post-war recuperation were but dust, and that the longer the war continued, the more hopeless and irremediable would he the disaster into which they would he plunged. They would then direct all their energy to bringing the war to a close a a soon as possible on almost any peace-terms, instead of, as now, to continuing it as long as possible in order to wear out the Allies.

There is only one way of bringing the disaster of continuing the War from this point of view home to them, and that i? once more to "clean-the slate" by the immediate denunciation of existing commercial treaties, by the United Kingdom.  This would at once shatter the fabric of their hopes, reduce them to despair, and bring the end of the War in sight. For this reason again the Federation of British industries cannot sufficiently urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the imperative necessity of the ? denunciation of all existing Commercial Treaties. The Federation is aware that in certain Commercial Treaties, such as the Japanese Treaty ? 1911, there may be technical questions in the way of immediate denunciation, but these are matters of detail which ? not prejudice the general principle. The Federation ? of course also aware that those with ? countries no longer exist.

As to the Allies, the course suggested in one which ? to be entirely in con? with their views no far ? their own interests are concerned, since . Fon?r Law stated in the House of Commons on June 27th of this 
year that &quot;The Italian Government have denounced, with two exceptions, all their commercial treaties by which Italian tariff rates of duty are fixed.     The French Government have Intimated their intention to denounce all their commercial treaties, and the  subject is now being considered by Hia Majesty5s Government.&quot;The Federation wishes to make it quite clear that in submitting these views it does not desire to go further than to urge the denunciation of Commercial Treaties and so leave His Majesty&apos;s Government untrammelled in considering the terms of future treaties when the time is ripe .
