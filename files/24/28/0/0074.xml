Document is the Property, ofH i s .3 v i t a n n i c M a i e s t y * sj-j-v-j-..&apos; &apos; v. -;h.reference to Sir Edward Carson1 s Minute 0.157 of October s I should like to remind the Cabinet of vvhat is at present being done. by the Ministry of. Labour-in regard^ to the aolleotion of information as to: the Movements to whioh he refers.   By a Cabinet Minute G.T..733 of the 15th May-it was- directed that the Ministry should create, an Intelligence Section with a view- to&apos;presenting a statement each week &quot;as- to stoppages, disputes,&apos; and settlements, and labour propaganda brought to their nbtice during the week, together with a general appreciation of the.Labour situation.&quot;   In order to ensure that all the information available on these subjects&quot;should be concentrated in one Department and. viewed as a whole, it. was further directed that, the Ministry of Munitions,&apos; Army Contracts, Department, Shipyard Labour Department, and the Goal Controller should send weekly reports to the Ministry.of labour, and that   : Scotland Yard, the Military Intelligence Section of the &apos;.7ar Office, and G.E.Q,.Hoine Forces should furnish.them with all reports bearing on labour Intelligence received - from their Agents, and with information on the same topics coming to them through the censorship.   Reports ere regularly received from all these sources, and, in addition, the Ministry makes a special and comprehensive study of all publications bearing on Labour questions, as was also directed by the Minute referred to.   It will therefore be seen that the Intelligence Section of the Ministry.of Labour has at present far more complete material for estimating the. various currents of labour unrest than any other Department, and that it has at its disposal, all the official information available on the subject.-.-Hitherto the Ministry has confined itself solely to questions affecting the Labour situation as such, and has not -dealt directly with the purely, political.&apos;mor/ements such as&apos;the&apos;Union of Democratic Control, except in so, far as they, affected the Labour, situation.   At the same time, it has necessarily amassed a good&apos;deal of information about the various pacifist bodies which are at present attempting to influence the- industrial population,   -Though it must always be remembered that the Ministry has strictly avoided making any enquiries of its own which might savour of espionage, and has relied entirely on the reports of Scotland: Yard and the V/ar Office for secret information,; it may be useful: to,&apos;summarize the impressions gained as to the various bodies- referred to. &apos;No evidence has at present come to light which shows that the Union of Democratic   Control or the.No-Conscription Fellowship are financed from enemy.sources, and the fact that they command the support of very, wealthy Quaker families may account for their ability to-carry on !their present activities-..&apos; The I;L.P. not only contains wealthy individual members but is rapidly becoming, a numerically pov/erful organisation,, and so acquiring large ,funds from its membership.   It has certainly made very great strides during the last twelve months.   There is also the Herald League founded by Mr. Lansbury and stimulated by the &quot;Herald,&quot;   It is not very powerful, but is^apparently growing in numbers.&apos; In addition to those political pacifist bodies there is the Women1s Peace, Grusdde, which is pacifist pure, and simple.,   They-are exceedingly active and have carried on organised campaig^as in the industrial areas, especially in Scotland,; South Wales and London,-   The I;        and other socialist papers are at their sex vice, record their progress, and advertise their meetings.   The/Women&quot;s Suffrage-pederatVoh,, having for the moment attained it politie&amp;l db^ec/bSj has turned its attention to pacifist agitation and. holds regular meetings in-Pinsbury Park.   A rather different type of body is the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers (not to be confused with Ur^Hogge^ Federation of a similar nanec)   This organisation, which was originally started by Sgt.-Major Blythe and obtained considerable support especially in the .MidXa^&amp;e and South V/alesr ia against the Gevernitent, and is een^equantly hoatjtle to its War policy.   Its plea/for
for stopping the War 18 that it produces large numbers c? disabled men who are shabbily treated by the Government.The above organisations are of a purely political character, hut they are always ready to utilise any opportunity of exploiting industrial troubles, and consequently have more than once been mentioned in the Reports of the Ministry of Labour as factors in the industrial situation,   Thoy must, however&quot;, bo distinguished from the other- three bodies mentioned by Sir Edward Carson - the Industrial Workers of the W^orld, the Rank &amp; Pile Mth&amp;fient, and the Shop Stewards Movement.   Those throe Movements arc largely inter-acting, and the two latter, in so far as thoy contain any definite organisation, may be regarded as practically indontical.   Those Movements are primarily industrial in character, and are only to some extent and quite incidentally opposed to the &quot;Jor.   They contain a revolutionary element whioh is hostile to Government as Euch, and to.this Government in particular, but its hostility is far more directed against the capitalistic system fchan even against the political system.   This element is non-national in its outlook, and the outcome of the War only interests it in so far as it is likely to affect the economic situation.   Here again there is at present no evidence ?/hatever cf German money; on the contrary, the Shop Ste?/ards are constantly in difficulties for funds, and are always having to make freeh collections, whioh cannot increase thoir popularity.   Tho Industrial Workers of the World has only recently come into this country, and as was pointed out in the Report for August 1st, it requires close attention.   Thoy arc running a paper, and are printing pamphlets etes lavishly.   Purther enquiry as to the origin of their funds would no doubt be desirable,    hero is also a body called the Industrial Workers of Great Britain, an offshoot of the 1../.W., whioh is actively fomenting industrial unrest on the Clyde.These industrial movements have been constantly studied and referred to in the Weekly Reports on the Labour situation. Lengthy notes of their activities appear in the Reports for 30th May, 13th June, 8th August, 22nd August, and 5th September. Althoughtthe Ministry of Labour has more dealings with the accredited Trado Union officials, it is hardly the case that it has not kept in touch with the unofficial movements in the Labour world.   In fact, apart from       receiving the information available, to all the other official sources on the subject, it would be impossible for the Ministry to carry on its everyday work without realising, the existence of these forces, and without estimating their objects and power.   In toany of the disputes with which the Ministry has had to &amp;ea3., the situation has been coimplicated by the activities of unofficial strike committees, and in a number of cases their representatives have been interviewed at the Ministry in company with the regular Trade Union officials.I am inclined to think that instead of setting up a further authority to supply the Cabinet with information on questions whioh mat in many of their aspects closely effect the Labour situation, it would be preferable that the functions of the Intelligence Seotion of&quot;the Ministry should be definitely extended to oover the pacifist propaganda, and that the Home Office should be aBked to furnish the Ministry with a Weekly  Report on this subjeot.   As is pointed out by Sir Edward Carson pacifist agitation is &quot;necessarily intertwined with tho whole question of Labour unrest,&quot;   and I think, therefore, fchat it can be better judged in relation to tho general situation than if taken as an isolated phenomenon.   I.would scrongly urge therefore that tho present concentration of. information into one channel should be continued &amp;ad oztended rathei than that duplication should be caused by creating a second channel.&quot;
I have felt, moreover, that insufficient use is &quot;being nz&amp;e Of materials available in the Linistry for indicating the directions in which counter propaganda is necessary, and.it would be desirable that some regular method should bo established by whioh the Ministry can bring to the notioe of tho proper, authority questions on which propaganda might be ueofully xuidertalren.George H. Roberts 10/10/17.MIKIS5EY OF LA30UR.
