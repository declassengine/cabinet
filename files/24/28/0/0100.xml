Colonel JonesVisit of Agriculturists te Devastated Areas in France.i i.. i Kin in i  I     iw a    i      &apos; m -.....-Memorandum &quot;by the President sf the Board sf Agriculture and fisheries.I desire to supp**t the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Scotland (War Gabinet G.T.2266) that a solooted party of Scottish farmers and labourers should visit the devastated areas of the Western front, and afterwards desoribe the conditions to audiences of farmers and labourers in 8cotland,I believe that the first-hand impressions of agricultural eyewitnesses, who have seen for themselves the ruin of Northern France, would materially stimulate the movement for the increased production of food in this country,    The points and details which have most struck an agricultural observer are those that are most likely to bring a picture of the hardships endured by the French peasantry vividly before the minds of British farmers and labourers.For this reason I support the suggestion of the Secretary cf State for Scotland, and suggest that similar parties representing the farmers and labourers of England and Wales should be organised for the same purpose.     The Board has already been in sonmunication with the War Office sn the subject,R,B, PHOTHSHO,16th October, 1917
