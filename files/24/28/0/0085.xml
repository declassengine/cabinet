RAIDS,PROVISION OF COVER PI LONDON.REPORT of the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet (War Cabinec- Minute 15) to considerthe question of providing cover in london against Air-raids, such Committee consisting of, -The Rt. Hon, Sir Ci-ecrge Cave, M*P.    (Chairman). The Rt. Hon. ST.. Hayes-Fisher, M*P^, andMajor-General Sir F.C. Shaw, K.C*B,The first question which the Committee had to consider was whether an endeavour should be made to provide cover for all those inhabitants of Lohdon who might not feel safe in their own houses, or only for those who would be likely to be in the streets in tho case of a raid.   The Committee were all of opinion that it is dsifikisirLele to encourage people to leave their houses in order to take shelter elsewhere.   A house however lightly buil-fc forms a good protection against splinters; and the risk oi lives being lost by enemy bombs is less if the population are scattered in their own homes than if they are collected together1 in shelters which cannot- be made bomb-prooftt     Further, if families leave their houses during the raid in order to see^ better shelter elsewhere, they run a serious risk of being hit in the streets by bombs or splinters from our own guns. The Committee therefore camo to the conclusion that shelter should be provided for persons who may be In the open in tho case of a raid,, and that the inhabitants should be discouraged (but not prohibited) from leaving their houses for the^se shelters..,-The Commissioner of Tollee has for some time past been making arrangements for utilizing all available shelters and for regulating admission to them,     These include railway stations, tunnels and arches, town halls, schools, public libraries and. other public buildings, crypts and basements of churches, and many hundreds of private buildings such as factories with suitable basements.     The annexed return shows that shelter is already available for about 900,000 people, and additional buildings are being tdbAq available for the purpooo.   But there are still many districts, notably in tho poorer parts of London, where the available shelter is not yet sufficient; and although it is probable that few people would resist an appeal to provide shelter, it is advis-able that a regulation should be made under the Defenceof the Realm   Acts empowering the competent authority to require the occupier of any suitable place to throw it open as a shelter in the case of raids.It has been arranged that persons who are willing to give shelter shouldi. on warning of a raid being received, exhibit a placard with the words &quot;Air-raid shelter&quot;\ and the use of the shelters will be regulated
- 2 -471--^y-nh*ij*oJJ-ctf**a^ In the case of the Tube &quot;stations,where there was some overcrowding on &quot;&quot;the,, oooas-ion of the late raids to the great inconvenience of bona fide passengers, the railway companies have been recommenced to take steps to avoid any such misuse of their stations in the future.With regard to the suggestion that cover might be arranged by the construction of dug-outs in the parks, it appears that bomb-proof dug-outs must be 20 feot below the ground and require heavy timber and effective drain-age o   Assuming that 6 socaro feet per man of floor space is required, about 170 yards of gallery 12 feet broad would-be required for every 1,000 peoplo, and about ten entrances i?ould be needed for such a gallery.     This is special work which would have to be performed by tunnelling or field companies of tho Royal Engineers or skilled labour of a similar character, and it is doubtful whether either the materials or the labour for carrying out work of this kind on a large scale \70uld be available.     On the other hand, S&apos;plinter-proof dug-outs or shelters would only require 9 inches of earth carried on corrugated iron or planking with suitable support, and if built aboveground the walls must be of the same thickness and the entrances and exits must be proteetodo     But this kind of dug-out, though proof against splinters, is not proof against bombs or unexplodcd shell- and it does not afford more protection than an ordinary house.     Upon the whole the Committee doubt whether it is desirable to give effect to this suggestion at the present time.^fith regard to the use of sand-bags or cinder-bags, some of these are in use already and others arc being provided for use in the police stations and elsewhere. The supply of sacking material for these bags is necessarily limited at the present time, and it is impossible to provide sand or cinder-bags for any large number of houses; but if bags can be procured or improvised they --/ill of course afford additional protection.Uo doubt the Local Authorities will give all the assistance in their power in finding shelter, bags, etc.The Committee therefore recommend -(l)     That the Commissioner of Police do proceed with his arrangements for providing shelter;(2)     That a regulation be made under the Defence of the Realm   Acts empowering the competent Authority to require any premises to be mado available as shelter in caso of raids, and suitable notices to be exhibited;(3)     That for the present dug-outs be not provided in the parks;(4)     That all practicable steps be taken toincrease the protection afforded by existing shelters.It will be necessary to give publicity to the arrangements for shelter when completed.Signed on behalf of the Committee, (SdJ     GSO.
