r A considerable number of different schemes for paintingshiDs with a view to making then, less visible or disguising them&apos; have been triad during the last three years, culminating in the adoption in Juno, 191*7 of the &quot;Dazzle&quot; system, which was submitted to the Admiralty by Lieutenant Norman Wilkinson, R.N0V,Rt, the Storeship &quot;INDUSTRY&quot; being the first ship to be painted,The -painting of &quot;ships with the &quot;&quot;DAZZLE&quot; scheme is based on the general&quot;assumption that it is impossible to obtain iiivis-ibility at sea, especially where as in the case of an attacking submarine, the object is seen against the sky with practically no sea to form a background.A Submarine on the lookout for enemy ships will in all probability locate a vessel by her smoke, even when hull down, so that no colour scheme aiming at invisibility is likely to save a vessel from attack.    Again, where the vessel is hull up^. or within attacking range, she is a definite shape with no deception as to her -course, when painted an even tone all over whatever the colour used.Therefore, the only course open is to paint her in such a way as to deceive the attacker as to her size and course; this can only be done by extreme contrasts of colour and shapes, which will so distort the vessel as to destroy her general symmetry and bulk.In order to prevent the enemy becoming accustomed to any particular1 design, the plan of painting each ship, and each side of a ship differently has been adopted,,The process of lining out and paintino: ships has been found to be a simple matter providing the colour shapes are kept flat,.:jv Only colours easily procurable are used.In order to assist in the breaking iro of actual lines and forms by the suggestion of false ones, the^use of lights and shadows in accordance with Thayer&apos;a Law is incorporated where necessary, The scheme is being extended to all mercantile ships.Approximately 150 ships have been or are being painted including Standard Ships and Armed Merchant Cruisers, and, in addition, for trial purposes, &quot;RAMILLIES&quot;, &quot;CONCORD&quot;! &quot;VINDEX&quot; &quot;FEARLESS&quot; AND &quot;TEST&quot; have been so minted; and designs are in&apos; preparation for &quot;K&quot; class submarines, &quot;SNOWDROP&quot; class and later TBD&apos;s,Designs hove been supplied to the United States Destroyers in accordance with Admiral Sims&apos; request  and full information has been furnished to the Naval Attaches of &quot;France, Russia   Italv America and -*3k:pan: preparations have been made with the French&apos;%va.r Attache whereby the whole of the French Mercantile Marine mav&quot;he supplied&quot;&quot;&apos; with &quot;Dazzle&quot; plans in a short time.The above memorandum is submitted for the information of the War Cabinet.(Sgd) Ec CEDDES.9/10/17.
