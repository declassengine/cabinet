This Document is the Property ofSECRETHis Critannic.-Mgjesty&apos;9 Government     ,....DSPifiamiii- of ii^oreatioewEEKLY     REPORT     ON     GERMANY. 10th Of:to jer, 1917,1.      The object ox the last report was to show the extreme difficulty oi interpreting the situation in Germany from the information provided through the German press. Since it was written we have received a lengthy report of a conversation held in Switzerland vvith a German Professor, a member of a well-known Jewish family who, according to his own account, has been working in close association with Relxfericb, and has connections, not only with governmental, but also in industrial, financial and literary circles.-     He edits a well-known serious periodical as well as a &quot;Foreign Office Publication&quot;.     He is reported as having spoken very frankly about the general, economic end political situation. The more important passages dealing with the political situa-tion in Germany are appended, as they seem to merit careful reading;   other portions which bear on war-aims and Austria-Hungary, will be dealt with separately.     We cannot of course depend fully on a report of this kind, for we wish to know why a man in this position should have spoken -so freely, and if he was doinp so without ulterior motive, the very fact that he showed so little reserve is evidence of qualities that might injure his political judgment.2.      The most striking passages are the description of the Lrzberger incident and the fall oi Bethmann-hollweg;   it will be seen that he regarded the crisis as a very serious one and is of opinion that it will return,     &quot;In the Government depart-ment consternation and chaos reigned&quot;.    &quot;Had a German Kerenski arisen, the Reichstag and the whole nation would have been
bohind bim for good and perhaps for all time&quot;.     After the Crisis had been got over owing to the interference of Lndendorff and Hliidenburg, &quot; rzberger1 s star, temporarily set, but it still has to reaob its zenith&apos;&apos;.     The  -rofessor added that &quot;he believes with mrny of the most prominent men in Berlin that anything mi-;;ht happen in Germany now1&apos;.     &quot;he has become absolutely con-vine ed that the people have the powei in their hands and intend to utilise it slowly but surely for the formation of a demoera-tic government in Germany.     Another crisis will arise, perhaps followed by another and still another.     Finally, through their trade unions the workmen will insist on having their way, if necessary utilising strikes to have it, for revolution is in the wind.&quot;     &quot;That three months ago seemed impossible has taken place.   The elements of revolution have appeared;   anything might happen;   the power is with the people.     A few more revelations and disappointments, a few extra trials, more heavy casualty lists, and then the breaking-point of the strain v/ill be reached.     Something has gone wrong in Germany.3.      This is e much stronger statement than any that .vehave hitherto received from any reliable source, but anothersimilar secret report from cn American source tells us:&quot;The German array itself cannot be broken down, but discon-tent among the people is very great.     GJhe Germans are most vulnerable on the political side and, if it were possible for an election to be held, the Social Democrats would be victorious to the extent, of 75 per cent of the Reichstag. In fiuooiet public expressions have been heard to the effect that Great Britain and Prussia were the two greatest enemies of Germany.&quot;4.      In commenting on this we must distinguish between two possibilities(l)   A political change brought about by constitutional pressure exercised by the Reichstag.     In regard to this we must note that, according to eur authority, Germany was on the verge of such a revolution, but it failed because there was no
leader.     This observation is probably a true one.     The Reichstag had the opportunity but it failed to use it because there was no man or men who had sufficient authority to keep together the different parties whose temporary coalition brought about the crisis.     But this weakness continues. Germany appears to be entirely without politicians who have a strong position in the country; and, without a great loader, it seoms difficult to expect that another crisis will have any different issue from the last.     we are told that &quot;anything might happen in Germany&quot;;   but this does not exclude the possibility that nothing may happen.(2)   The second alternative is revolution in the streets and a revolt arising from the working men.     This again seems extremely improbable, for in a. country with so strong a government as that of Germany a successful revolt could only be possible as a eshh^k^ result of very clever seciet propa-ganda or as the result of absolute despair.     We have no reason to suppose that anything of the first kind is taking place on a large scale, and Germany has not yet reached, though it may eventually reach, the stage of absolute desti-tution and misery which alone could bring about the second.If the latter was to happen it would probably start by a revolt of the women.5.      It is difficult therefore to see how an essential change can take place in Germany owing to the pressure of opposition or revolution unless the governing machine itself breaks down;   this is a contingency which under certain circumstances is not impossible.    This could, however, only happen, if the mistakes which the Government made and the difficulties which they had to meet led to dissensions whioh no longer could be kept secret.     We can be cuite sure that the German Government is, and knows that it is, confronted
by enormous and almost insupera le diffioulties;   we can be quite sure, as was pointed out last week, that when the best method of meeting these difficulties is discussed, there is a fundamental antagonism between what we may call the Tirpitz Party and the Moderates, and that both these parties are represented in.the governing circles; the former especially by the military authorities; the latter were represented by Bethmann Eollweg; he has gone;   they are now probably repre-sented by ICuhlmann.     There are coming up matters of great importance on which a decision cannot long be delayed;   with regard to foreign policy there is Belgium, a point on which the difference of opinion is most pronounced;    in internal policy there is Prussian reform.     It is difficult to see how any definite action can be taken on either of these two ques-tions without bringing about another crisis, a crisis which would be accompanied by very bitter debates in the Reichstag and the Prussian Parliament.6.      All the evidence seems to show that, notwithstanding what is said in the papers, good is done by continued reference to the distinction between the German Government and the German people and the reiteration of a demand for a democratic, self-governing Germany.    (The distinction between government and people is probably not altogether a sound one, for in the opinion of many, it was the people as much as the government y/ho were responsible for the attitude of mind which was the real cause of the war, but anyhow the distinction is a useful one).        And it seems that if the point were made, it would probably be most effective if it were put forward as a sober statement of fact freed as much as possible from the language of menace or abuse, so as to convince them that we seriously and honestly believed that the maintenance of the present system in Germany would be a continued danger to Europe, and,
therefore, that it could not he permitted;   and that in this we should be at one with the real beliefs of a very large sec-tion of tho Gorman and also of the Austrian people.     It appears that the more quietly this were stated, the more effective it would be.     All the information which we get is also to the effect that it is a mistake to insist on the policy expressed in the words &quot;no peace with the Eohenzollern&quot;.     It is probably not so much the personal policy of the  Snperor as the tradition-al spirit of the Prussian nobility and the Prussian army which we now have to meet;    it strengthens them if we put forward the Emperor as their loader or figure-head;   it strengthens also his position in Germany.     It is probably wiser not to attach to his person the importance which the press and public opinion do.      At present more effect would be caused by laying stress on the blunders and the follies of the government rather than on their crimes.     At this moment Germany is full of disgust with these blunders;   even though lichnowskyrs personal opinion may not be important, it is not unimportant that men such as he and Count Posadowsky, who have held high office, come forward with public criticism of the government.    The Germans are very sensitive to criticism of their intellectual capacity and they will respond readily to intellectual criticism.     All this will tend to accelerate the collapse of the government machine which is the object to bo aimed at.1*.      The report appended confirms the belief that the Government made a complete miscalculation as to the effects of the submarine warfare, and the result of this, as it becomes moro widely realised, will do more than anything to destroy confidence in the wi3dom of the Government.8.       The Debates at- the end of last week, which wore mainly concerned with a Socialist interpellation on the alleged official propaganda in the Army and elsewhere in favour
of Tirpitz1 now Chauvinist and reactionary Fatherland Party, seemed to have seriously weakened the Government.     The Fveichs-tag majority showed itself very ill-disposed towards Helfferich, who appeared in the new office of Vice-Chancellor without port-folio and who manifested a good deal of temper when he failed to obtain a hearing.     k significant symptom was the threat to withhold or delay supply (authorisation of 4,000 million marks of Treasury Bonds) or to vote the estimates for the new official the &quot;Vice-Chancellor&quot;.     On Monday the Chancellor himself ap-peared and gave repeated assurances that the abusive exertion of official influence in favour of any particular party v/ould not ho tolerated.     Tho War Minister, General von Stein, also spoke in a more conciliatory sense than last week.     Finally, the House appears to have let itself &quot;be placated and against the Socialists - including apparently the Governmental Social-ists - it passed the supplementary Estimates for the new post of vice-Chancellor.     It nevertheless lohks as if the majority will not be put off with a &quot;substitute&quot; (Helfferich) for the one responsible Imperial Minister, and will insist upon ex-planations from the Chancellor himself on all critical ques-tions.     Tho majority is convinced that the present system is quite imcompatible with Parliamentary Government and that a Cabinet of responsible Imperial Ministers, instead of irres-ponsiblc representatives of the Chancellor like the present Imperial Secretaries of State, is absolutely essential. In many quarters it is regarded as probablo that Helfferich will have to go and that Michaelis himself will not stay very long, but if there wore two Chancellor crises within six months, the German people and tho bureaucracy itself could not fail to feel that things were beooming very unstable. The cry of tho majority cealition of parties for real repre-sontativc Ccvernmcnt, instead of the present bureaucratic Government, would gain still further in volume and in influence,
And, if the wider ranks of the bureaucracy began to realise that the hitherto impregnable position of the highest ranks -the Chancellor, the Prussian Ministers and the Imperial Secro-&apos; taries of State - as the repositories of authority, were being shaken, widespread disorganisation might easily ensue.9.      While the majority parties still insist sn the im-portance of the famous Reichstag resolutions, wo have from ono quarter a strong repudiation of it, and oven frcm the liberal side an attempt to explain it away.     At a recent meeting of the National Liberal Party, Stresemann, Bassermann&apos;s successor and the new Loader, condemned the Resolution in toto.   the im-pression created abroad had, he said, been disastrous to Ger-manyrs prestige and he regretted.that the roply to the Pope had made any reference to it.     There could bo no question of dis-armament.     A mistake had been made in repudiating annexations and thus destroying the negotiating value of the pledges now in Germany1s hands.     Even if they meant ultimately to give up Belgium, thoy ought not to say so publicly.     Nor ought the opportunity of establishing closer connections with Livland and Courland to bo lost.     A resolution was afterwards carried in the Committee thanking the party in the Reichstag for having &quot;unanimously rejected&quot; the Reichstag&apos;s proposition.     Germany^ future could not repose on intornational treaties but must be based un German might and forco.     Uithout an extension of pewer in the East and West, and without the securing o5 Shyir world possessions beyond the seas, and without adequate in-demnitios, they would have no security against future menaces to their oxistenco, and they would be thrown back for decades in thoir development.     The actual military situation fur-nished a pledge that Germany^ frontiers wsuld receive the improved protection that was requisite and that the economic future of Germany would be secured.
10.      Even in the ranks of the Radical Progressive party,they have symptoms of stiffening.     One of the loaders, EerrMiillcr (Meiningen), said that the reason tho Resolution wasadopted was that the Social Democrats, the strongest party inthe Reichstag, threatened to vote against further war creditsunless it were passed      What was secured Toy the Resolutionwas national unity, and in particular that &quot;tho working classeswould now hold out side by side with the bourgeoisie.&quot;   Hedefended the resolution as merely embodying the opinions whichthe Austro-Hungarian Government had declared months ago withthe approval of the German Government.     He thought that theResolution had achieved a success with the neutrals in spite ofthe rago of the London and Paris Press.The Resolution, he went on to say, did not mean theacceptance of the formula of a &quot;Scheidemann peace or peace ofrenunciation (Yerziohtfrieden)&quot;. The Resolution gave full scopefor whatever peace negotiations might achieve on the basis oftho whole political and military situation,&apos; while &quot;its principaldemand, the demand for tho freedom of the seas, gives us againstEnglish insolence scope emugh in the interests of the wholeworld, if *ur heroic armies, as we may confidently expect,remain victorious&quot;.As to &quot;annexations&quot; Herr Mtiller (Meiningen) said:&quot;T/e cannot, we do not desire to put a spoke in the Govern-menfs wheel if the Government considers it necessary for the security of our frontiers to make acquisition of territory (applause).     I consider it an utter mistake to renounce oncefor all acquisitions of territory either in the East or in the Eest.&quot;11.      Here then we still have the language which was common a year and a half ago;   there is no essential change from the demands made at the beginning of the war.J.W.H. G.S.
APPENDIX toWSE 1Y REPORT ON GERMANY No.AGY//023.Extracts from report of a conversation with Professor ---, of Berlin. 1.10.17.(0)     THE POLITICAL SITUATION.ERZBEROER1S SPEECH.     THE PALL OP BETHMANN HOLLWEG.Bethmann Hollweg fell because he hedged.On the one hand the Junkers feared that he was yielding too much to the Social-Democrat movement;   on the other hand when ER&amp;BERGER sprung a surprise on the Reichstag dealing with submarine statistics, etc., three-fourths of the assembly (including the Centre Party) rose against him and against the Junkers, the Pan-Germans and their croed.?jffC.fcDsor---relates that on that day he went round toseveral Government Departments in BERLIN.     Consternation and chaos reigned.     It was fully expected that bureaucracy had seen its last day.    Democracy was about to come into its own.Erzbergerrs speech came at a poculiarly psychological moment The Reichstag knew that, behind him, was the public and the whole Centre party in agreement with the Social Democrats and Radicals.When he hurled at tho Government and Bethmann Hollweg tho errors of their statistics as regards British tonnage and prov-od that the available ships at Great Britain&apos;c disposal 7/as near double the figures that the submarine policy had been based on, panic ensued and the fate of the German Empire was looked upon at that moment as almost sealed.Had a German Koronsky arisen, the Reichstag and the whole nation would have been behind him for good, and perhaps for all time.THE APPOINTMENT Off MICHAELIS.     THE LUDENDQRFF-HINDENBURGULTIMATUM TO THE KAISER.     THE ROLE OP THE CROWN PRINCE.When the above crisis eccurrcd Ludendorff and Hinde^urg hurried to Berlin, followed by their ally the Crown Prince; they immediately proceeded to make an effort to roctify matters.The Junkers and Pan-Germans, followed by a portion of the Centre Party, threw their lot in with the Military. Thus within a few days Erzberger and hi3 Peace motion were somowhat discredited.     Erzberger&apos;c star temporarily set, but it still has to roach its zenith.
The Panic subsided.     Members calmed down.Ludendorff, Hindenbnrg and Co., backed up by tho Crown Prince, wont to tho Kaiser, presented him with a list of candidates for the Chancellorship, threatening resignation if one of their nominees 7/as not selected.Besides that of MICEAE1I3, it is said the names of VON BUIOW and TIRPITZ appeared.     (The Professor was a littl doubtful especially of the?? former).The Kaisor objected to TIRPITZ on the grounds that, early in the war, he endeavoured to force himself into the Chan-cellorship,VON BUIOW he refused to appoint, being the best-hated man in Germany; it was a certainty that the people would object to him strongly.Consequently, MICH3EIIS was chosen.     As a &quot;Dark horse&quot;, and having boen a success in the Food Control Department, neither the Reichstag nor the people would object to him. Thus did the nominee- of the Military Party, the Junkers and Pan-Germans meet with the approval of the Centre and Social-ists ITHE INFLUENCE OP LUDMDORffE1 (AND HINDENBURG) , TEE JUNKERS AND CROM PRINCE OVER THE KAISER AND REICHSTAG. THE POWER Off THE PEOPLE.The Kaiser is influenced, but not necessarily under the influence of LUDENDORFF, HINDENBURG and Co.Through the Junkor party, a considerable amount of pressure can be brought on him.     Recently, a section of the industrials, the &quot;heavy&quot; division, manufacturers of goods from &quot;homo&quot; raw material - iron and coal, etc. has been brought round to the Pan-German idea.     It too can bring pressure to bear on the Emperor.The Junker class formerly consisted of officers in tho Army, Judges, other Civilian Leaders, Agrarians, etc., but owing to the war, the ranks, especially the Officers, have been depleted.     Regulars have been killed off, the substi-tutes belong largely to the people or progressives who have little in common with this war and thus with those who commenced it.Hoy/ever, it is this Junker class, and, with it, the Military, that certainly has, if not a direct, an indirect influence on the Kaiser, thus the Chancellor and the Reichstag.The Crown Prince is an appendage to the Military loaders.Prom this, it might be assumed tho people are scmewhat powerless and that lu&amp;cndorff and Hindenburg can rule the reost, but Professor -- affirms sinco the ERZBERGER indi-dont, he believes with many of the most prominent men in Berlin &quot;anything might happen in Germany now&quot;.
Up to that moment, he was an entire sceptic, hut, after the crisis, he has become absolutely convinced THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER IN THEIR HANDS AMD INTEND TO UTILISE IT slowly but surely for the formation of a democratic Govern-ment in Germany.SCHEIDEMANN, EBERT, with other democratic loaders, have recently warned MICHAELIS and the Kaiser of coming events, exhorting them befora it is too late to make peace by every moans possible.The ALSACE LORRAINE nBundos3taat,T is instanced as an example of bureaucratic defeat.These men aver that, before very long, another crisis similar to the Erzbergor one, will arise, perhaps followed &quot;by another and still another.     Pinally through their trade unions the workmen will insist on having their way - if necessary utilising strikes to have it - a Revolution is in the wind.Fearing a revolt might take place Peace Negotiations will then be commenced in earnest.POPULARITY OF THE KAISER AND CROW PRINCE.THE FUTURE OP THE HOHENZOLLERN DYNASTY.Although Professor --Ts wife is related to the Hohen-zollerns,&apos;his reply to this ruostion was: &quot;If the Kaiser, the Crown Prince and whole Hohenzollern dynasty were put up to auction t^day, they v/ould go cheap, if there was a bidder&quot;.The Crown Prince is heartily disliked by almost every-bsdy except perhaps a few of the military party.     It is sincerely trusted he will never ascend the throne.His private life has given riso to much talk and scandal.Eevertheless, the pious hopo is expressed by many that the Kaiser will have to accept the role Of a limited monarch;   then perhaps the Entente and America -will ccn-sent to treat peace with him and allow him to remain as a figurehead.(D) . THE SUBMARINE POLICY.     AMERICAN INTERVENTION.When the war commenced, TIRPITZ did not believe that the submarine would be anything like as powerful a weapon as it has been.Later on, when it was found that voyages could be effect-ed into the Atlantic, his views changed.     He then exhorted the Government to accept unrestricted warfare.
HE1FFERICH (who seems to have an influence over the Kaiser) disagreed with TIRPITZ chiefly on the plea that it would bring America, and may be other neutrals, into the War.However, in January of this year, the latter changed his opinion, probably through pressure brought to bear on the situationmby the military party.In a discussion he (HELFFERICH) had&apos;with Professor - -, the former maintained Great Britain would be starved or brought to terms by June.     That ammunition supplies would be so ham-pered that the British Army would suffer in France and he unable to keep up a powerful offensive.Even if America came in, he argued it would be too late for them to take any action as before they were ready GERMANY WOULD SECURE PEACE.     In any case, the troops they might bo able to send would be torpedoed en route.Professor --- replied that, according to his views, he didnot believe it possible England could be brought to bay be-fore January or February 1918.Reluctantly the latter admitted to us that even his &quot;pessimistic&quot; expectations were wrong, although the Military Party still base PRACTICALLY ALL THEIR HOPES Oil THE SUBMARINE.They all know now the end is not yot.The German Government hypnotised itself into believing unrestricted submarine warfare would bring about peace before American intervention could have any effect.     It further argued that Americans were vory much divided.     If England gave way they assumed America would climb down and accept the inevitable.     Amorica they believe now is moro determined than all the roet.     Hino illao lachrymae.(33)     SOME MISTAKES OF THE ENTENTE IN DEALING WITH GERMANY.     HOW TO BRING GERMANY TO TERMS.1.     LLOYD GEORGE - BALFOUR - A COMPARISON:The German people fear the speeches of Lloyd George. Every word is published, overy phrase pondered over deeply. His last few orations have been looked upon as meaning &quot;War to the end&quot;.   Thus, the people are discouraged, and, &quot;in consequence their backs are stiffened&quot;.Comparing Lloyd George1s hard-hitting methods with the softer ways and manners of the author of the &quot;Foundations of Belief&quot;, he states that, from the German point of view, Balfour&amp;s methods are the host.N.B.   We rather gathered from him the Germans are afraid of being hard hit.
2.     GERMANY MUST BE LED - NOT COERCED:The Professor maintains that, if British politicians in their speeches, were to &quot;suggest&quot; rather than to &quot;threaten&quot;, the humble (I) German people would be led into the right path quickly.     By &quot;threatening&quot;, the desired goal will not be attained.Be draws attention to the fact that the British Press is not taken so seriously by his people, neither so much dwelt upon nor quoted, as do the words which fall from the lips of great men like Lloyd George.     The latter are read, re-read, digested and finally assimilated into the public brain.The reply of Wilson to the Pope has had a remarkable effect for good.He suggests to British politicians that certain phases of current events should be dealt with in speeches of promi-nent men:   that the submarine atrocities, the Belgium depor-tatlons and cruelties, the Armenian and other massacres, should be referred to and anathematised as the acts of a barbarian GOVERNMENT;   thus alone will the German people be eduoated up to believe in the errors of, and the horrors committed by, their irrespondible rulers.Slowly the truth will filter through the thick skull of the Teuton and make him realise that the World has good cause to rise up in arms against him.He will then insist on a democratic movement to replace the rotten rulers of Germany.3.     A SUGGESTED POLICY TO BRING GERMANY TO TERMS:If, very cautiously, it is allowed to penetrate into Germany (not in the form of a threat) that, for example a ten-year embargo on German shipping and ports might be decided upon by the Allies (if the Allied peace terms are rejected), it is possible that the people would, after a short while, realise the dangers of such a situation.     It would spell ruin and the end of Germany.Because of the fear of it, the war might be shortened considerably.8.     THE HOHENZOLLERN DYNASTY AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.It is to be hoped the Entente will not insist on refusing to treat with the HOHENZOLLEENS, for, in such case Germany would consider it an unwarranted interference with her internal politics.     It would certainly cause a con-siderable portion of the population to remain refractory.If a settlement with a democratic Government is insisted upon, doubtless some change might be effected, through which the Imperial Chancellor, instead of being appointed by the Kaiser, should be nominated by tho Reichstag.    The JknperorTs powers would be thus curtailed.    Universal suffrage is coming.
g.   CONCLUSIONThe above lines, we hope, clearly, briefly, and as correctly as memorising a long conversation admits, give Professor  &apos;s statements to us.Ho appeared to be sincere in most of all he said, but behind his words stood out a taint of pessimism   which he vainly struggled to suppress.Certain impressions forced themselves upon us during our interviews, and we left him with the feeling SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG IN GERMANY.When speaking of &quot;Raw materials&quot;, he hesitated at times, On the subject of man-power - quantity and quality - he appeared reticent, if not nervous.     When dealing with the submarine, he openly admitted the &quot;hope deferred&quot; if not the &quot;melancholy truth&quot;.But the greatest, the haunting fear of Bureaucracy is the People,     In Professor  -rs own words:&quot;What only three months past seemed impossible has taken placo.     The elements of revolution have appeared, any-thing might happen.     The power is with the People&quot;.Some more LUXBURG revelations.     Another half-year of rationing;   a little further disappointment in the sub-marine;   a few extra trials;   more heavy casualty lists, and THEN BREAKING     STRAIN     WILL     BE R E A C H E D&quot;T, :THIS     TIME   the Central Empires are craking;Professor --- breathes that;   FORSTER says it;   both havecome from the entourage of the two Kaisers.The Governments are discredited, the Emperors pitied, the German Crcwn Prince ridiculed and detested - Indeed the H0HENZ01LERN DYNASTY &quot;is going cheap without a bidder&quot;.The Kaiser, we are told, spends much of his time at prayer meetings, rather than at &quot;mailed fist&quot; gatherings, although outwardly bombastic still.The melting down of bronze statues, effigies of former Emperors, is, may bo, a shadow cast before, said Prof.  with a smile.GERMANY, it is evident has &quot;got into a scrape and wants to get out of it&quot;.the luxburg telegrams.This exposure caused a huge sensation in GERMANY. A few more such actions on the part of German Officials will effectually seal the fate of the present method of Government.     It is to be hoped &quot;that America will publish some more similar records&quot; said Prof.---.
