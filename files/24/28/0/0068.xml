gjJJ E T. WAR   CABINET.,aaT.2268.^---- PPOPAGAWM.SUGGESTED VISIT CP WORKERS AND OTHERS TO THEATRE OF WAR. Memorandum by Sir E, Carson.There are unmistakable rsl-gns of war weariness in the Nation.    At the beginning of the fourth year of war this should cause no surprise, but in order to prevent its becoming a source of serious national weakness it is very necessary to supply a tonicc     The only effective tonic is a fuller understanding than the masses of the people at present possess as to (a) the magnitude of the issues at stake,  (&apos;b) the stupendous extent of the military and economic effort now being made by the Nation, and fc) the results which these efforts have attained up to the present, and their prospects of complete ultimate success.Among those who have given thought to the best method of enabling the people to acquire this understanding there is general agreement that nothing would he so effective as the opportunity of seeing for themselves the organisation, the accumulation of material, and the operations at and behind the fighting front in Flanders and France.     It is a spectacle that deeply Impresses all who have been enabled to see it, and it is calculated to exorcise a profound influence especially on the minds of men without either the experience or the imagination required for forming an idea of what modern warfare means. There are millions of mu.nxt.ion workers in thecountry who for three yra;.*s have listened to appeal after appeal to produce shells tc ensure Victory, and to assurances that victory was certain, but who perceive little result as 7et from their patriotic tell, and have therefore become so dis-pirited by hope deferred as to be easily duped by the pessimist and the pacifist.They have seen endless quantities of the material they turn out despatched from the factory, into the unknown, but they have no idea lew it is u.sed or the effect it produces. If the maker of she]Is could see the ammunition dumps at the front, if the make?- of guns could visit camouflaged batteries, if both could witness the burst of British shells over German lines, they would return to the factory with a spirit more braced to continued effort, and more determined to see the war through, than would be gained from endless speech-making or pamphlet-reading.       Attthe present stage of the war the diffusion of such a temper amon^ the workers at home is not less essential to a vigorous prosecution of the war than even !oe production of ships, aeroplanes, or guns, and should be Undertaken on a substantial scalo as an important part of the scheme of operations.     Parties of workmen have already from Ume to time been conducted to the front, but the time has come to do this on a more regular system and larger scale than heretofore.     It should be possible to arrange for not less than a hundred workmen being taken every weak to France
for a visit of two or three dare.     The objection that this would involve a heavy tax on Head.guarte.rs Organisation, on Staff Officers,   lotor Oars, aocoixiodation and so forth, would be waived the moment it is realised that the object in vie-.v is not &quot;joy-riding&quot;i but Far work.     It might require the addition to the various Army Stalls of a few officers detailed for the special ..ork of conducting these parties of workmen, thy. requisition of a few buildings near selected sections of the front, the- provision oi a feu motor vehicles for conveying the visitors,&apos;   &quot;out all this would amount to an almost negligible enlargement of the gigantic machine of organisation directed from ftenoral Jfeadquarters,These parties of  .orkmen would, of course, have to be sonductod by Officers of tact who would recognise that they should be treated with the sa,..e consideration ana. courtesy as are shown to Cabinet  &quot;inisters or influential foreigners, and who would also be thoroughly competent to explain in a popular, way the significance of everything to be seen at the front.     The manner in which the workiwen should be selected to visit the front is a point of the ..irst importance.     Those passed over must in an;  case be: the enormous majority, and. they must be given no ground for suspecting, ho.ever unreason^ ably, that the selection is based on favouritism or on the Qovorniuenfs desire either to reward or to influence particular individuals.     The character of thosw selected should be a matter of Indifference to the authorities.     It might prove as useful to take a slack workmen as a diligent one.     The selection should,  therefore, bemads- by the iwen themselves,. A particular factory, or a particular trade union or other organisation, would be notified(that on a date n^wwed a specified number of .forkers from their unit would.be taken to visit the front and would be requested to nominate - either by election or by whatever other method they preferred - the stated number of representatives,   .ho would then be accepted without question or enquiry by the, authorities.     Only by such a mole of seieotion oan suspicion,, heartburning and complaint be certainly avoided.There is no reason why visits of workmen to the fleet should not be similarly organised, anu on something approaching the same scale.     It might be found possible In many cases to leave to the men themselves the choice whether the-; would prefer to see the Fleet or the Front.,     But in any case, shipyard workers, and men engaged on turning out if aval ordnance, would,be interested and encouraged by seeing their finished product ready for business, and the sight of assembled&apos; battle-ships .and cruisers would prove inspiring in the highest degree, and extremely effective in stiffening the warlike determination of the visitors and those with &quot;horn they would be in contact on their return to labour.. If it be decided to carry out th. scheme outlined above, it is very desirable that publicity should be -wiven
to it by the Prime Minister himself.   If Mr*\Lloyd George were to seize the occasion of a platform speech to announce that the time had come fof the war workers of the country tc see some of the wonderful results of their labour and r   sacrifice, and to judge for themselves whether the complete I    victory for which they have toiled is no* within sight, and to be attained by a determined continuance of their efforts, it would be the most effective possible intrcduo^ tion to the invitations to be then issued to wc-rkmen in pursuance of this scheme.In this connection reference 3hould be made to complaints that are rife among members of the House of Commons that opportunities have not been afforded them cf seeing what is going on at the front.   As an appeal is now being made to Members to address Meetings in the Country in behalf of the War Aims Committee it would seem reasonable that facilities should be given them to witness for themselves v/hat they will desire to describe to their audlenoes, and if large numbers of workmen are conducted to the front the claim of Members of Parliament will be strengthened.   It would be well, if possi-ble to remove the ground of complaint in this matter.I 3hould like to have a decision from the War Cabinet on this matter..
