J.. navies, ySir J..Dunlop Smith,&apos;7Rear-Admiral A. F. Everett, &apos;7Sir George Fidde.3. tSir T7. Graham Greene., &apos;Sir Thomas Heath, -/Sir Oswyn Murray, j&apos;Sir F. Ponsonby, v/Hon. Theo Russell, /Sir E. Tro&amp;p?War Office. India Office. Admiralty. Colonial Office Munitions. Treasury,. Adrlralty Privy Purse. Foreign Office. Home Office.The Committee having discussed the various considerations involved, present the following Report and Recommendations.1. The total numbers^of each Class to be given in the UnitedKingdom*It is doubtful whether it is possible at the present time to fix these numbers with&apos;, any accuracy,  since the total numbers to be given during the war must necessarily exceed the normal establishmento    Since however it is advisable to have some rough idea of the total numbers to be given,  in order that a correct proportion may be allotted to the Dominions and Crown Colonies,  the following numbers are suggested on the assumption that a person working at home should have the same chance of earning a decoration as the soldier in the field.   The per-centage of decorations and medals to men.in the field has been estimate;&apos; at 2,jzf0f but it has unfortunately not been found pos-sible to obtain any reliable statistics with reference to the number of people at home who could be properly considered eligible for this Order.
pIf this percentage ( 25 per thousand) can -be taken as a rough estimate, and applied to a Department like the Ministry of Munitions, which numbers about 750,000,  it will be seen, that in this Department alone 18,750 Decorations and Medals will be required.   This figure is however misleading since it includes medals,  and in all probability no more that a quarter would be persons eligible for an Order.    If,  therefore, 4,000 is taken as the probable number that will eventually be required for one Departoent, it is clear that the original figures suggested are totally inadequate,  they were;*.*The Number of knighthoods (1st and 2nd Classes) if not already too numerous,  ceuld not well be increased without depreciating the value of that honour.   In vie1?; of these con-siderations the Committee recommend that the three lower Clashes should be doubled, and that the following figures should be taken as a rough guide100.      &apos;300.       1,200.       4,000.       6,000.The Committee further recommend that this number should be divided into 3 or nore Gazettes,  and that 10% of each Gazette should go to the War Office, Admiralty. Munitions, Shipping and Air Board,  and that the remaining 50%. should be distributed among the other Government Departments -2. Total number^ to ber allotted^to^ India^It would be open tc misinterpretation if India was debarred from participating in the distribution of an Order intended for the whole Empire, but taking into consideration the faot that India already has two Orders in addition to the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal,  to dispose of,  the Committee recorn-mend that approximately the same number should be allowed to India, as vail be placed at the disposal of Canada,  (The largest of the Dominions.)3o Total number to be allotted to the Dominions.Taking the population of the Dominions as approximately one quarter ef that of the United Kinfdon,  the Committee recommend that ^ of the numbers calculated for the United Kingdom should be allotted to the Dominions,  and that this quarter should be sub-divided by the Colonial Office on a basis cf population among the different Dominions.&quot;   The numbers of each Class thus arrived at should be spread over at least three Gazettes:    January 1918;    The King?s Birthday, and January 1919, possibly more,4.      .    Total numbers to be allotted to- the Crown Colonies, It is re coy mended that l/l2th of the total numbe&quot;rs calculated for the United Kingdom should be allotted to the Crown Colonies.?&apos; Should Civil Servants.be eligible for the OrdercThe Committee having discussed the difficulty of giving the O.B.E. at the same time as existing decorations, and the danger of that Order becoming a second-rate distinction, ! recommend that the Order should be given at present to the Members of the Civil Service only for work directly con-nected with the war-   It is particularly important that1st.100.2nd. 300.3ra. 600.4 th. 2,000.5th. 3,000.
women in tho Civil Service who have rendered services in connection with the war,  should not be excluded.Qn what principle should the Order be distributed to Allied countries^ajiohshpulajthe number be limited. &apos;        It is Imp o r t ant&quot;&quot; that&quot; the high standard&quot;&quot; of British De co-rations in Europe should be maintained,  and therefore the numbers should be limited.   At the same time it is clearly-impossible to place all the Allied Countries on the same footing.   The Committee suggest that half the total numbers calculated for the United Kingdom should be given to all the Allied Countries,  and that the Foreign Office should be asked to fix the proportion of each Class to be awarded to the different countries.Sheuld members of the Diplomatic and Consular Services be eligible jfor the Order/ &quot;The   inclusion&quot;of a certain number of Members of the Diplomatic Service in the first Gazette (which has been done with a view to give the Order its proper status in the eyes of foreigners on whom, it mi tht be conferred) appears to have been resented by them,  as the recipients were under the impression that the fact that the 0 .B.E. had been confer-red on them would render them ineligible for the Order of the Bath.    The Consular Service however in on a totally dif-ferent footing from the Diplomatic Service,  as they rarely rise to sufficient eminence to be considered for the Order of the Bath.The Committee recommend that while both Services should still be eligible, the practice of awarding the Order to the Diplomatic Service should be discontinued.Should officers of the Any and Navy be clegible for &apos; the Order.No recommendations can well be put forward on this point until some decision has been arrived at by the Army Council wit;: regard to the principles on which officers and men are to be rewarded.   If it is decided to give the D.S.0. and M.C. to officers nerving at home,  and to dif-forentiate between services under fire ana services at home by the addition of crossed swords on the cress,  the C.B.E.. should be restricted to civilians, and officers of both services woulc therefore not be eligible.If on the ot er hand it is thou ht that public opinion would resent these Decorations being- given to Home Services the O.B.E. would be an appropriate means of recognising the claims of officers serving in the United Kingdom, leaving the Military Decorations to become the sole reward, for services in any theatre of war.The Admiralty was of opinion that at present Naval   ? Decorations would meet all the needs of the Navy, but was prepared to discuss any scheme whereby officers on shore would be eligible for the Order,Similar distinction between officers of Allied CountrieThe&apos; decoration of Military Officers abroad with a civilian Order would not be understood in foreirn countries, and in any case it would be practically im-possible to draw any satisfactory line between those officers who would be given Military Decorations,  and those who would receive the O.B.E.
The- Comrittee therefore roco/aaend that the 0.3,2. should he restricted to Civilians abroad.10. Should the 0rder be giyen to Noutrals^It is obvious that no Neutral could well accept a British Order at the present time.   It is therefore suggested that the question of decorating officials in Neutral Countries should stand over until the conclusion of the war-,11. Should aj3ertj?.in^ numberjbe piaj3od at the^disposal of theSecretary of State for Foreign A-ffairsTIn order to p&apos;ro&quot;tect&quot;*lne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from foreign decoration hunters,   since he would be placed in an intolerable position if it were known at Foreign Embassies and Legations, that ho was authorised to confer the O.B.E.,  tho Committee recommends that the O.B.E. should be placed on exactly the same footing as existing Bri tish Decorati ons.12. How, and by whom, should the Medal of the Qrder be given.The conditions of service vary so much in all the various Government Departments that it has been found impossible to draw up any regulations governing the distribution of the Medal that would apply equally to all classes of workers. The Committee- therefore rvjccm-iend that a sub-Commit tee should be appointed to enquire into anci report on the various pro-posals that have been put forward for the distribution of the Medal.
