Tlvs Document is the Property ofHis   r-itannic MaJ.esty&apos;s Government) 353 ICirculated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.ZIONISM.1. I am sorry to bother the Cabinet with another Paper on this.subject, but I have obtained some more information which I would like to lay before them.-2. We have received at the India Office a series of valuable papers on Turkey in Asia from the pen of Miss Gertrude Lowthian Bell, the remark-able woman who, after years of knowledge gained by unique travel in these regions, is acting as Assistant Political Officer in Baghdad.   She writes : &quot; Not least among the denationalising forces is the fact that a part of Syria, though like the rest mainly inhabited hy Arabs, is regarded by a nou-Arab people as its prescriptive inheritance. At a liberal estimate the Jews of Palestine may form a quarter of the population of the province, the Christians a fifth, while the remainder are Mohammedan Arabs. Jewish immigration has been artificially fostered by doles and subventions from millionaire co-religionists in Europe ; the new colonies have now taken root and are more or less self-supporting. The pious hope that an independent Jewish state may some day he established in Palestine no doubt exists, though it may be questioned whether among local Jews there is any acute desire to see it realised, except as a means of escape from Turkish oppression ; it is perhaps more lively in the breasts of those who live far from the rocky Palestinian hills and have no intention of changing their domicile. Lord Cromer took pleasure in relating a conversation which he had held on the subject with one of the best known English. Jews, who observed : &apos; If a Jewish Kingdom were to be established at Jerusalem I should lose no time in applying for the post of Ambassador.in London.&apos; Apart from the prevalence of such sentiments two considerations rule out the conception of an independent Jewish Palestine from practical politics. The first is that the province as we know it is not Jewish, and that neither Mohammedan nor Arab would accept Jewish authority; the second that the capital, Jerusalem, is equally sacred to three faiths, Jewish, Christian and . Moslem, and should never, if it can be avoided, be put under the exclusive control of any one local faction, no matter how carefully the rights of the other two mav be safeguarded.&quot;This extract shows fully the extent to-day of the Jewish population of Palestine. Again I ask, is it conceivable by anyone who knows the country that there is room in Palestine for a large extension of the population ? If this does not occur, what part of the existing population is it proposed to dispossess? Having regard to the geographical, geological and climatic conditions of Palestine, is it worth while jeopardising the position of all Jews Avho remain in other countries for the insignificant fraction of the Jewish population that can conceivably find a home in Palestine? I would beg the Cabinet to consider this matter as a practical proposition. I yield to no one in my admiration of the distinguished Russian, Professor Weizmann, who looms so large in our discussions. His services to the Allied cause have been great. He is a scientist of repute. But on this matter he is near to / being a religious fanatic. His enthusiasm for this cause has been the guiding principle of at any rate a large part of his life. It is his over-Avhelming enthusiasm. How often do such enthusiasms lead to complete disregard of practical potentialities ! How little likely is such an enthusiasm to take into account the susceptibilities of those who differ from him among those of his own religion, or.of those of other religions whom his activities, if successful, would dispossess i3. The Cabinet has been informed that the French. Government are in sympathy with Zionist aspirations.   It has recently come to my knowledge
officially that the French Ambassador has approached our Foreign Office with a proposal to establish a Jewish nation in El Hasa in Arabia, oblivious, of the fact that although this is technically Turkish territory, we have concluded so recently as 1915 a treaty which roughly promises to support Bin Saud and his followers in the occupation of the country. I quote this to prove that the French are anxious to establish Jews anywhere if only to have an excuse for getting rid of them, or large numbers of them.4. I have obtained a list of a few prominent anti-Zionists. It will he noticed that it includes every Jew who is prominent in public life, with the exception of the present Lord Rothschild, Mr. Herbert Samuel, and a few others.Dr. Israel Abrahams, M.A.,University of Cambridge.

They contain among them ultra-orthodox as well as certain heterodox -lews.1 submit again that the Cabinet&apos;s first duty is to Englishmen, to citizens of the British Empire of British traditions. I would submit with great respect that it is not their business to espouse the cause of Americans, Russians, Austrians, and Germans, naturalised though they may Be, in the teeth of the ardent wishes of those who have lived for generations in this country, and who feel themselves to be Englishmen. At this moment Jews-are constantly being attacked for being outside the great national feelings which the war has engendered, and of being cosmopolitan in their sympatlry and international in their aspirations. This is a gross libel on the Jewish-Briton. It is true of the Zionist I hope that the British Government of which I am a member, will pause before ignoring the British feeling which I represent in this matter in favour of that section of the community which is international in its views.5. The opinion of the present Chief Rabbi is quoted. I would quote the opinion of the late Chief Rabbi who held that office amid great respect for many years, and only died a few years ago.
&quot; When we dwelt in the Holy Land we had a political organisation of our own ; we had judges and kings to rule over us. But ever since the conquest of Palestine by the Romans, we have ceased to be a body politic; we are citizens of the country in which we dwell. We are simply Englishmen, or Frenchmen, or. Germans, as the case may be, certainly holding particular theological tenets and practising special religious ordinances ; but we stand in the^ame relation to our countrymen as any other religious sect, having the same stake in the national welfare and the same claim on the privileges and duties of citizens. To Mr. Gold win Smith&apos;s question &apos; What is the political bearing of Judaism ? &apos; I would reply that Judaism has no political bearing whatever.&quot;&quot;The great bond which unites Israel is not one of race, but the bond of a common religion. We regard all mankind as Brethren. We consider ourselves citizens of the country in which we dwell, in the highest and fullest sense of the term, and esteem it our dearest privilege and duty to labour for its welfare. Is there aught incompatible with our devotion to humanity and with our patriotism, if, at the same time, we feel sympathy for those who profess the same religious faith and practise the same religious ordinances, whether they inhabit this country or other lands ? If the bond which unites Jews were, in truth, tribal, it would be a matter of perfect indifference to us what might he the religious belief or practice of our brethren in race. But the bare fact that we regard as apostates those of our fellow Jews who abandon their faith, is proof sufficient that religion is the main bond.&quot;6. In an interview with Mr. Norman Bentwich in 1909 the following, passage occurs : &quot; Interviewer r But do they (the Zionist students) feel they can completely identify themselves with the English nation ?&quot; Mr. Bentwich: They feel that, as Jews this is not possible. They cannot be as entirely English in thought as the man who is horn of English parents and descended from ancestors who have mingled their blood with other Englishmen for generations. . . . There is no use disguising this fact. To me it seems impossible to separate religion from nationality in Judaism.&quot;This is precisely the spirit against which we who are not Zionists protest, which I feel would go far to justify the exclusion of Zionists from British citizenship, and it was not to be wondered at that the Graduates and members of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London deplored this statement.7. It is asserted that the American Jews are in favour of Zionism. The President of the Twenty Eighth Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, held in Buffalo, New York, on 28th June of this year, said :  &apos;&quot; I am not here to quarrel with Zionists. Mine is only the intention to declare that we as rabbis, who are consecrated to the service of the Lord, whose lips are to guard knowledge, and from whose mouth the people, are to seek the Law, because we are messengers of the Lord of Hosts, have no place in a movement in which Jews band together on racial or national grounds, and for a political state, or even a legally assured home. . . . The religious Israel, having the sanctions of history, must not be sacrificed to the purely racial Israel of modern planning. . . . The time has come for this Conference to pu blisli the statement that it stands for an Israel whose mission is religious, and that, in the light of this mission, it looks with disfavour upon any movement the purpose of which is other than religious.&quot;Mr. Jacob Schiff, the leading Jew of America, writes on 11th May.1917 as follows :-&quot; The breaking down of the Ghetto walls in Russia and. the dispersing of, and the radical change in, the social status of one-half of our entire race, cannot but have a far-reaching effect upon the Jewish, problem everywhere.   One thing appears certain, that the feeding, from the
late Russian Pale, of Jewry outside of Russia, and especially of Jewry in our own country, both in numbers and in the product of the great Jewish mind, is sure to become greatly reduced, if it is not going to cease entirely.&quot;&apos;&apos; The danger is great that this may, in coming generations, lead to disintegration, and I have asked myself what can be done to counter-act this. Now, we cannot, and must not, close our eyes to the fact that Palestine has a peculiar attraction for the. Jews ; more so now even than in bygone ages. This, I feel, in the face of what has taken place in Russia, should be taken advantage of to establish in Palestine, not a Jewish nation, but the seed for a large, if not almost exclusive Jewish population, among which Jewish religious life, Jewish thought and Jewish learning would develop in all its primitive purity and become a reservoir, out of which would flow the stream to stimulate Jewry wherever it may exist among the nations of the world. The Mississippi and other great rivers would run dry, and the countries dependent on these rivers would go to waste, if the fountain-heads of these streams became closed up and so, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, Jewry will disappear and its mission will cease, if somewhere there is not a centre or central reservoir from which it can be ever, and ever fed anew.*&apos; Feeling in this respect as I do, and having come to the conclusion that a remedy for existing conditions may possibly be found in the. repopulation of Palestine by the Jewish people, I continue at the same time of the opinion that no effort should be made to re-establish a Jewish nation, because I believe, were this done, the very purpose which is in my mind would become destroyed. I believe I am not far wrong if I say that from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, of the so-called Jewish Nationalists are either atheists or agnostics, and that the great majority of the Jewish Nationalist leaders have absokitely no interest in the Jewish religion. Conditions in this respect are already now-before a Jewish nation has actually been established, as is the desire of these Jewish Nationalists the same as those which existed when the Jewish state was an actuality and when priest and prophet were ever in disagreement and feud with kingdom and state, and which led in the end to the state&apos;s destruction. This would surely happen again were a Jewish state again established.&quot;8. I have obtained two other extracts which may interest the Cabinet:  &apos; (1) Italy.Signor Luigi Luzzatti, the eminent Italian Statesman who was Prime Minister in 1910, writes (Jewish Exponent, 18th May 1917) : &quot; Jews must acqxrire every where full religious liberty as existing in the United States and in Italy. In Palestine, delivered from Turks, Jews will live, not as sovereigns but as free citizens, to fertilise their fathers&apos; land.   Judaism is not a Nationalitv but a Religion.&quot;(2) France.M. Joseph Reinach, the weil-known French Deputy and &quot; Polybe &quot; of the Figaro, writes under date of 12th April 1917 : &quot; Patriotism is the first of our duties.   It is the duty of every country toaccord the same rights to all citizens without regard to their beliefs.In this respect Rumania will certainly follow the example of Russia. &quot;Iain a resolute adversary of Zionism.. Jerusalem belongs to all thereligions.   We know its history for 3,000 years.  The Jewish Kingdomendured scarcely five centuries. &quot;Judaism is a religion.&quot;The absolute duty of the Jews, as of the Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox, is to serve their country as good citizens and loyal soldiers. Zionism has been a dream. To-morrow it will be nothing more than an archaeological snare.&quot;E. S. Montagu.9th October 1917.
