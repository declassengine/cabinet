1/ 1OPERATIONS. SECRET,From :-   General Barter, Russia. 1-10-17.To C.I.G.S., War Office;repeated Caucasus Military Agent.1278.Your -11860 of 24th September.   This morning I had interview with CG.S. and Q.M.G.   They both informed me that whole question of possibility of any Russian co-operation with General Maude mainly depended on financial assistance of British Government.(2)    Prejevalski now asks for 2,000,000 sterling per month stating that this was absolutely vital for the provisioning of Russian forces in Persia and local purchase of transport. Chief of Staff promised to give me to-day letter showing categorically for what this huge sum is required, and I will telegraph you again later.(3)   Prejevalski has telegraphed that with this financial assistance morale could be improved sufficiently to permit advance to line of Rowandus Suleiman Iyeh, and of Baratov13 advance to line of Dialha and Kifrl.   Without It not only could no action be expected, but it was highly probable that Russian Forces would have to be withdrawn from Persia.(4)   There was no possibility of doing anything to help Maude with main Caucasus Army, not even the contemplated demonstration in the direction of Mush and Bitlis.(5)   Saratov&apos;n troops were still influenced by horrors of last year&apos;a famine on Dialha and no action not even demonstration could be expected unless they could be quickly provisioned.   Saratov intended to replace troops of doubtful morale by more trustworthy units.(6)   They assured me that they were highly anxious to render every assistance in their power and they had repeated their orders to Prejevalski to do everything possible to ensure co-operation with ilaude, but they added that nothing could be done without the necessary financial assistance, A further delay of two or three weeks was now unavoidable,(7)   My own Impression is that genuine effort will be made with Saratov&apos;s troops but that practically no action at all will be attempted by 7th Corps, and that there is no chance of line Rowandua Suleiman Iyeh being occupied by Russian troops this year..   Morale of 7th Corps reported very bad. I of course pressed vigorously for utmost possible efforts on part of Russians representing extreme urgency of matter.
