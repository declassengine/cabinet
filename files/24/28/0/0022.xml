tis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty7 s Government) e4 &quot;IW A H     C^AJlIJiE0?* AIR   B5-0RGAI12ATI0I^ Memorandum by General Smuts,Air questions are likely to be raised prominently at the forth-coming Session of Parliament, and I think it would be the proper course for the Government to publish in anticipation of the Session a short statement indicating what has been done by the Cabinet in&apos; . regard to the proposed Air Ministry and Service.    If this is not done, and a statement in only made in response to pressure of Members in the- House, it might appear as if the Cabinet has been inactive in the meantime and has been goaded into action by criticismo   I would, therefore, suggest that the subjoined notice be given to the Press   ^ this week:-&quot;The War Cabinet decided during the summer in favour of the &quot;principle of establishing a real Air Ministry and a unified &quot;Air Service into which both the Royal ifaval Air Service and &quot;Royal Flying Corps would be incorporated,    A Committee pre-&quot;sided over by General Smuts and a number of. Sub-Committees &quot;have been working out the detailed arrangements required to &quot;give effect to that&apos; decision    A Bill embodying the Govern-&quot;ments proposals will be laid before Parliament at its forth-&quot;coming Session&quot;,6th October 1917c (Intd,) JcC.b.C; R Eg; &apos;. 2222.
