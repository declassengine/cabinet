Take Jonescu, the Roumanian Statesman, written to a friend of mine, is, I think, worth circulating to the V.ar Cabinet.(Intd.)   S. C2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 11th October, 1917.*      *      o      o      o       *      o      *Our situation is really one of the most tragic.     We have done what we were bound by our honour and our interests to do, but the results have been a little more trying than we expected - I mean including what is going on in Russia.   Nobody belioves in the possibility of Russia recovering seriously.   The best that can be hoped is that they will remain on a more or less successful defensive.     But what then?     To make peace would be the greatest, the most criminal and suicidal folly. Naturally I don!t speak for Roramania - she will never make peace, even if Russia would make one, which I den&apos;t think at all possible.     I speak fcbout the Allies in general.     But again what then?     Is there no combination by which one could bring the Jap in Russia, or at least somewhere in the Mediterranean, Salonica or Suez, or another point?     Imagine only 500,000 &quot;Japs with the Roumanians. - how many they will-be then I donTt know, they melt so seriously - the Czechs prisoners of war (some 200,000 in Russia), some Serbian prisoners and some Poles.

would be an army of more than a million men.   But what an army and what men i     And if the Bus sian Army could give another million of men wanting to fight, the problem of the Eastern front would be solved.     I cannot see Germany having Jcpan as an elly and making euch little use of it.     The &quot;best army perhaps in the world, idle for three long, years I     There may be greet difficulties, like the transport, which two years ego would have been so easy by sea.     But there are no insuper-able difficulties.     Experience tells me that by the Trans-Siberian half a million of Japs could be transported to he on the front in the spring.     The effect would be marvellous. And now I cannot understand why such a splendid asset has been ignored.     If it is for the consideration of what Japan would do afterwards, such considerations are valueless.     Only one thing m&amp;tters - victory.-   We must, have in the spring and the summer of next year victories.     Otherwise I &amp;on&apos;t think it would be possible to go on for the fifth winter.     I donTt like what I feel about the sentiments of the masses in the west.     The collapse of Russia,-not by the hand of the Germans, but by the stupidity of her Extremists (what nonsense all the talk and the press of our neighbours) may so easily explain a certain fatigue which is so visible in the masses of the west, or at least a portion of those masses.     Some great victories would change everything.   Those victories are essential to enable the Allies to continue the war to the necessary end.      -Peace now would mean revolution everywhere six months after, and a new war even in my lifetime perhaps.     For this victory the arrival of the Japs would be a great help. -I tell you only a personal idea, but one which seems to me essential.     My.idea is clear:    to have a real peace we want a long war,,-to. have a long war we want great victories, &quot;to have great victories one must do everything. : Between those things
the arrival of the Japs in the 3ast and of tho Americans in the --;est seems to me the most important.I may he wrong hut I feel so strongly that I am right.Ileturally I d.onTt know if the Japs would accept to come and on what price. Thafs why I write to you Ghent it, and I am saying nothing in public.
