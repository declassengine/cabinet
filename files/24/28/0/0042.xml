But as the French Prime Minister has unexpectedly come over,  I think it desirable to forward them at once. It will be understood that the statements made in the&quot; Jaffa - Jerusalem paper are subject to anything General Allcnby may say..(Sgd)   W.R.&apos; ROBERTSON.C . I. G. S.War Office.10,17.
K C-R gjgy 0.1/12 5/3 58 rCOPY NO .  1 uFUTURE MILITARY POLICY.9.10.17. ^ .1.        At the meeting of the War Cabinet Policy Committee&quot; &quot;fon the 5th instant.the Prime Minister laid stress upon the desirability of eliminating Turkey from our list of enemies. It was held that her general condition is such that a severe defeat, coupled with the effective and secure occupation of the line Jaffa - Jerusalem and including both those places., might.,, if followed by suitable diplomatic measures, induce her to break with her Allies.     I was instructed to examine the feasibility of this policy and to ask General Allenby for his views with special reference to the. reinforcements he would require, if any..     As the project must obviously be considered in connection with our future military policy in general I submit the following observations so as to assist the War Cabinet in coming to correct decisions on the whole question.2. If it is eventually decided that./ in order towin the war, it is essential,, in the first instance, to get Turkey out of the war by a combination of military and diplomatic action, Turkish territory will become-, for an indefinite period/ the decisive theatre and the West front must meanwhile be relegated to secondary importance..     This is so because we have not sufficient resources to seek a decision in two theatres at the same time,     No country ever has had, or probably ever will have.     The first rule in all wars is to concentrate in the main theatre all forces that can be employed.     Any departure from this rule has invariably proved to be disastrous.It
AdmiraltyIt is quite impossible to say now long it may take to eliminate Turkey, or how many troops we may eventually require for the purpose.     If it is to our interest to get Turkey out of the war it is equally to Germany1s interest to keep her in - that is, to help her.     Any policy based on the assumption that Turkey can be got but by diplomatic means coupled with a military defeat of a certain severity less than the uecisive defeat of her main Armies, or by a given number of men or in a given uime, will be of the nature of a gamble, and a gamble at this stage of the war would be more dangerous than usual.      The consequences of.our adopted policy, whatever that policy may be, must be clearly faced, and we must determine to carry it through although possibly at considerable cost to other operations and interests.3.       Further,  it must be recognised that any troops sent this y/inter from France cannot be relied upon for fighting in France next bummer.     Communications alone are against this possibility to say nothing of the necessity for training and the limitation of physical powers, and I must once more remind the War Cabinet that we are at an enormous disadvan^ tage in moving troops as compared with the Germa.ns.     They can move at least 10 divisions a month from the East to West front, or vice versa.     It has recently taken a month to move one ox our divisions from Salonika to *Jgyptt although several vreeks warning of the move was given previous to the commencement of embarkation. For themovement of divisions from Marseilles to Egypt the
Admiralty Transport Department states that a commencement cannot be made before 15th November, and then divisions can be moved only at the rate of somewhat less than two a month. To refit a division for service in Palestine and rail it to the front three weeks are required after its arrival at Alexandria,4*     It must also be remembered that by increasing our forces in Palestine we put a further strain upon our shipping.. The Shipping Controller can advise as to this and the Admiralty as to naval escorts-, all I need say is that we must look well ahead-, and bear In mind the necessity of supplying our Allies and helping to bring over and maintain the large Armies which Amcrica can produce..5..     As to the moral effect, upon Turkey of our occupation of the Jaffa - Jerusalem line I do not claim to speak with more authority than anyone else., but the military effect would be of no value to us.     On the contrary,, considerably more troops would be required to hold it and the additional communications than are now required for the Gaza - Beersheba line, and this increased commitment would,, as I have already said, be for an indefinite period.6,     As a result of our conforming last Spring to the NIvelle plan and of the failure of that plan, the French Armies have rendered us very little assistance^ either directly or indirectly, in the prosecution of our nortnem operations.; tho commencement of those operations was unduly delayed;    and the weather subsequently proved to be very bad-.   Notwithstanding these great disadvantages events have shewn that we can beat the Germans every time we fight them and Inflict heavierlosses
losses than we ourselves suffer, The condition of the%   French Army and the general situation in France also need to be taken into account.        Politics have there largely taken the place of patriotism.        French Ministers are thinking mainly of the rear and not of the front of their Armies -that is of the pressure likely to be put upon them by deputies who are interested in releasing this or that class of men from tho Armies and not of the great military problems which face the Entente. The people, moreover, are beginning to be scepticalof the Americans winning the war for them.       For the above and many other reasons it seems to me most unwise to weaken our efforts on the West front.     Unquestionably it Is very desirable to reduce the number of our enemies, and. I can assure the Cabinet that I and my Staff have given the question most careful and frequent attention during the last few months.     But since Russia collapsed and we have been faced with the proposition of dealing with the whole Turkish Army, reinforced probably by German troops., and having regard to the military situation as a whole, wo have never been able to regard an extensive offensive campaign in Palestine as a sound military measure .8-- During the past week I have again reviewed the situation and -I can -cumo to .no other conclusion than that the right military course to pursue is to act on the defensive in Palestine and the e as t g enerally, and. continue to seek a decision in the West. I believe that this would give us the bestchance of final victory.    It entails, of course, that all resources---should be sent to the West front other than those-which are absolutely   required   for   the   defence   of   our   Eastern possessions,     and   for   the   moment   we   have   ample   forthis
this purpose.     With the troops wo already have In ralcstine, combined with the Arab activities which have been arranged, we may hope to obtain good local successes and to keep up strong pressure on the Turks.      Shipping is being assembled for the transport to the East of reinforcements from France in tho event of any being needed.     Until they are needed they should not be sent.     Early in the Spring wo should withdraw as many troops and guns as can be spared from the East and send them to Franco.9.        This is my advice and I oan only leave the matter in the hands of the War Cabinet..     I nood hardly say that success in the West, or indeed anywhere, requires that the War Cabinet should feel able to support in practice the policy of which they approve in principle.    Whatever that policy may be, once the decisive theatre has been solected it must be regarded as such, and all other thcatros be ruthlessly treated as secondary, and made to do the best with what is given them.10.        There are other essentials to success which I should mention in view of the forthcoming Allied Conference. The British Army alone cannot win the war--.     Our Allies must be made to fight.     They have failed us badly this year, and may be expected to fail still more in the future unless a strong line Is taken.     Nor can the British Army do the chief part of the fighting and also hold a full proportion of the line In France,     It is certain wo shall have to do most of the fighting next year.      For this wo mustrest
rest and traiy, our troops in the Winter.     To what extent,If any, we can extend our frtnt in a matter upon which Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s advice should be heard, and if in the negotiations with General Petain On the subject he needs the support of the War Cabinet, I earnestlj urge, in the Interests of the war, that he should bo given it.   In any case there can be no question of his taking over line whilst his -present important operations are in progress, and 1 hope that this will be insisted upon by the War Cabinet if the French Government raise the question.I may mention that the French have taken over none of our line in Jiacedonia since the withdrawal cf our two divisions, and that they have, it is understood, a very large number of men home on leave.11.   The principle of &quot;unity of command&quot; and &quot;one front&quot; must be cautiously applied.       In theory it is attractive; in practice it has not been encouraging.     It was responsible for the Havelie era and its consequences. To it also may be attributed the fact that some 150 heavy British and French guns sent to Italy, which would have been invaluable on the West front, have been out of action for the past month and still are.   So far as &quot;unity of command&quot; is concerned, we- should endeavour to acquire for.ourselves the control of operations next year on the !;;rest front, as we are entitled tc do by our successes this year, the efficiency and spirit of our Armies, and the stability of our Government as compared with that of practically all cur European Allies.
12,     We must avoid basing cur actions on mere numbers; Because Russia had a large population we sent her 400 Field Howitzers and 150 heavy guns and howitzers besides an enormous amount cf other war material.All are lest to us,   The Italians are pressing us for- heavy artillery in the Spring, and an object lesson as to- the use to which it may be put has just been furnished by Italy suddenly declining to fight and take advantage of a favourable opportunity:.      The Greeks are promising to put divisions into the field and are clamouring for heavy artillery, and as we are to find it they are being supported by the French.    But there is at present no real prospect that the Greek Army will ever contribute much tc winning the war.    For example, on the 6th instant our Minister at Athens wired that unless sufficient wheat is provided &quot;net only will Greek military plans prove a failure, but existence of present Ministry itself will be imperiled&quot;.In short the   general situation is such that our Allies require a strong military lead, and this necessi-tates that cur fcrcos should be provided with the means for giving this lead.    This cardinal factor should be considered when dealing with requests for help in any form from our Allies.
8. ^    ,13.     Finally, as the British Array is the most effective fightinr part of the Entente forces, it is of vital importance that it should be kept up to strength.    It is now much below strength;    recruiting is in a very bad condition; and, as I have many times said, we cannot expect to win the war unless every man who cah be spared for the Army Is made available.      In this connection there is, as the Far Cabinet, know, growing discontent because wounded men are sent back to the front time after time while ether men pre h*t taken for the Army,(Signed)9/10/17.W.

249    ISJE C RET. Copy No:   100.1/125/359. 9--; 10.17.     - jOCCUPATION OF JAFFA - JERUSALEM LINE.Z96/277. 1.    In a Paper on operations In Palestine, submitted to theWar Cabinet on the 23rd April last, it was estimated that the Turks could maintain a force of 200,000 men in Syria, of which not more than 60,000 combatants could be kept in the field south of Jerusalem.    Nothing which has since occurred has made it necessary to revise that estimate.    The Turks have for some time past been aware that we are preparing a serious offensive on the Gaza - Beersheba front and have now a force of 52,000 combatants south of Jerusalem, with two more divisions within four or five days call of the fighting front.   General Allenby considers that the force at his disposal will, when completely assembled, which will shortly be the case, be sufficient to defeat the enemy immediately opposed to him, and may possibly be sufficient to enable him eventually to reach the line Jaffa - Jerusalem,   As to this, if the enemy stands on the Gaza position and is given a severe blow, he maycollapse in the same way as the Turkish forces did at Kut, and General AllenbyTs fine body of mounted troops may be able to follow him up and prevent him rallying to the south of Jerusalem,    This is, however, altogether too problematical to be relied upon in preparing a plan of campaign.    The Turks are known to have prepared a number of positions between the lineBeersheba - Gaza and the line Jaffa - Jerusalem.   We must assume that General Allenby will have to offer battle on a large scale on the first of these lines, and we must reckon that he may have to fight at least two more such battles before Jerusalem is captured.    Since we know that Falkenhayn is aware of our intentions and that he cannot rely uponmaintaining
i dmaintaining on- the Gaza front a force capable of withstanding us in a pitched battle, it is probable that he will advise the Turks not to resist to&apos; the last there but to delay us and fall slowly back on prepared lines- in rear until such time as they are able to oppose-us with a force which will make the chances more equal.2.      . In order to fight his first battle General Allenby will have to--use all the&apos; 8&apos;even&apos;: infantry divisions at his disposal, and cur experience of this ^rar has shown that a division cannot be expected to maintain its-: efficiency after two hard fights if it has been at all severely handled.     - It is necessary in such circumstances to withdraw the division from the front to rest and refit, and&quot;to absorb and train Its new drafts.     Although the fighting .in Palestine is not likely to cause such a severe strain upon the men as that-in Plundersyet the difficulty of supplying draftsiis greater and divisions&apos;will run down quicker.    The Turk is a stubborn fighter-in trenches and&apos;we oust expect that in anv event&apos; he will stand&apos; long enough to cause us&quot;serious-loss, and that some at. least of General Allenby1s divisions will suffer heavy casualties,      -therefore, -though-it is possible that wo may be able eventually to reach Jerusalem with the force now in Palestine we must be prepared to supply General Allenby with three mere divisions to enable him to relieve exhausted divisions and to fight two or.mere battles if necessary before he reaches that place..     The Turk is in this respect more favourably sltu-ated than we are. -Although he can only maintain about 60,000 fighting men south of Jerusalem, he will have no difficulty in keeping: that number up or in relieving:entire divisions by
3.      Fhen the line Jaffa - Jerusalem is reached we shall have a front of roughly 50 miles to hold between the Jordan and the sea, as against 30 miles between Gaza - Beersheba, and we must expect then to be faced by a considerably increased Turkish force.Worth of Jerusalem the enemy will be within reach of the Damascus - Haifa railway, the. southern portion of which runs parallel to his line, making it possible for him to establish a number of depots conveniently placed for the supply of his troops.       He will also be able to use, at least for his left flank, the Hedjaz railway which taps the fertile Hauran district close in his rear.     With these additional facilities it is estimated that the enemy can maintain north of Jerusalem a force of 16 divisions giving him about 120,000 combatants.      If he elects to abandon his Mesepotamian enterprise and to devote his resources, now concehtrated on the extension of the Baghdad railway, to the improvement of the railway south of Damascus, this force may be increased.4.       As long as Russia brings practically no pressure to bear upon Turkey we have to reckon that the numbers the enemy can bring against us in Palestine or Mesopotamia will, within the limits of his resources, be restricted only by the number he can feed in those theatres.     At the present time there has been no serious movement in the direction cf Mesopotamia, and it is a reasonable assumption that Falkenhayn cannot concentrate in that theatre within the next three months a force large enough to be a real danger to General Maude.     It is quite possible that a closer study of the difficulties which confront him in an advance to Baghdad, the explosion at Haidar Pasha, and Maude&apos;s recentsuccess
4rsuccess at Ramadio may induce Falkenhayn to reconsider his plans and to cDncontrato his efforts on Palestine.       If   -this should bo tho case there is no reason why tho Turks should increase their force of 50,000 men which they now have In. Mesopotamia, and they will bo able to go on relieving divisions on tho Palestine front almost indefin-itoly.     Further, two German divisions arc known to be now ready for transport to Asia Minor, and if Germany sees that wo are trying to get Turkey out of the war, and if she feels the importance of keeping her in as she has kept Austria in, there is no reason why that number should! not be increased...    We must, therefore, reckon on being contin-uously opposed north of Jerusalem by 120,000 fresh combatants a portion of which may be Germans.5.     How, as to the force we shall require to hold a 50 mile front north of Jerusalem against such a concentration, and at the same time guard our lengthened line of communica-tions-.     For this, the ten divisions (120,000 combatants) and throe cavalry divisions which it has been estimated should, be provided for an advance to Jerusalem, should bo sufficient for a time, particularly as a successful advance through Palestine will most probably bring in the Syrian Arabs actively on our side, but wo must be prepared to keep tho whole of this force on or near tho actual front, so long as the Turks remain in the field against us.     Tho climate is trying in the hot weather and the troops must have relief or they will waste away..     If General Allenby reaches Jerusalem without very severe fighting and his divisions are comparatively fresh then,, the 10 divisions should be sufficient to hold the now front..     But we cannot reckon with certainty ^n these favourable conditions, and we must be prepared to send two more divisions,making a total
of 12 divisions in all, or five more divisions than General Allenby now has.     These five divisions will have to oome from France and of course be made up to strength before despatch...    It is not yet certain when Sir Douglas HaigAs operations will be completed, but at a favourable estimate it is- improbable that he could begin releasing divisions before the middle of November-/    Even if he were able to do this, we are. informed by the Admiralty that it will not be possible- to assemble the necessary shipping at -Marseilles before then.     From that   date It is estimated that the Divisions could be delivered in Egypt at the rate of one every 16 clays, provided the movement is not unduly inter-fered with by the enemy &apos;&quot;s sea-craft.     As to this the Admiralty can give no forecast.     On arrival at Alexandria it takes three weeks to refit a division,   and get it to the front so that the first division would. rea.ch the front towards the end. of December.      The three divisions required for the advance to Jerusalem could reach the front by the third week in January and the whole five by the third week in February,     If Sir D. Iiaig&apos;s operations are prolonged into November, or if the shipping or naval escorts are not forthcoming when required, the movement would be correspond-ingly delayed.6,     The calculation in the preceding paragraph assumes that there will be no local difficulty In delivering and main-taining the troops at. the front.     With respect to this, General Allenby states that the maintenance of his present strength of seven divisions, three cavalry divisions and his farce- of heavy artillery.exhausts the capacity of his single line- of railway.       The doubling of the line is in progress and will not be completed to Rafa for another four months - that is, until the middle of January.
The extension to Jaffa and in the direction of Jerusalemwill of course he necessary before General Allenby willbe able to maintain a force of ton divisions and throe cavalrydivisions on the Jaffa - Jerusalem lino.     How long thiswill take it is impossible to say-.     As the additional twodivisions mentioned in paragraph 5 arc destined for purposes efrelief they would not bo required at-once, and, therefore,need not be sent to the front immediately on our arrivalat Jerusalem.     Our single line will in a few days time bemaintaining a fighting strength of 120,000 opposite Gazaas against an estimated maximum of 60,000 which the Turkishlino can maintain, and if the difference in tho roquire-mcnts of British troops and of Turks in the matter ofsupply, tho number of our guns against those of the enemy(520 to 270), and therefore tho difference in the weight ofammunition to be carried - arc remembered, this comparisonis by no means unfavourable to the capacity and working ofour&apos;railway^     Wo have, in fact, every reason to believethat the utmost has boon done to develop the capacity ofour single line and therefore our power of maintainingin.Palestine more troops than arc now on the front willdepend entirely on the progress of tho doubling of thepresent line and on the rate at which it can bo extended.This extension will bo approximately three-quarters of a mile a dayand can bo begun on the day on which the Turks arc drivenfrom Gaza.     As has already been pointed out the conditionsnorth of Jerusalem become much more favourable to thoTurk.     Ho then has two linos immediately behind him asfar as Damascus and a largo fertile area In his immediaterear to draw upon.     Southern Palestine is, if our informa-tion is correct, practically devoid of supplies, and woshall have to continue to import and carry across theSinai
Sinai Desert everything which we shall require.7.     Apart from the question of transporting the divisions *o Palestine, their maintenance for&apos;an indefinite period in personnel and supplies must he taken into account. As to personnel, General Allenby has just asked, for 30,000 mor:-. drafts so that he may be able to keep his present force up tc strength when he starts fighting.     We have not got these men   tc give him, and in the present state of cur man-power it is extremely Improbable that we will be in a pesitisn to keep up 12 divisions in a hot climate and at the same time maintain our foroes in France and othor Theatres.8.     The general conclusion is that a campaign conducted this Winter for the occupation of the Jaffa-- Jerusalem line may, if the enemy adopts the sensible course and avoids decisive action, lead to little result beyond the moral advantages which we may gain.     It will almost . certainly entail a slow advance from position to position, the enemy avoiding decisive action and our progress being regulated by tha rate at which we can overcome the hostile opposition and push forward the railway from Gaza.    We cannot depend upon striking such a blow at the Turkish Armies as will seriously affect their military strength. The conditions would be materially altered if operations from the coast on a considerable scale could be combined with the land campaign.     This is not possible owing to the absence of a suitable port,  the nature of the coast, and the Naval difficulty of safeguarding the sea-communications..General Staff, War Office. .^9th October, 1917.,
