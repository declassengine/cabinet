(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^-Government.)-*32/1099,, pasWar Cabinet.Escape of German Prisoners of. Wat from Kegworth Camp.. Memorandum by the Seoretary of. State for War.With reference to War Cabinet 239(5), I circulate the following report.-The account of the escape of certain German prisoners of war from Kegworth Camp is substantially oorreot.The Court of Enquiry which was held shews that this is the third.tunnel which has been attempted during the last six months..   The other two were discovered.     It had been suspected for some time that a third was being made and although special steps were-taken, by. means of constant inspections and listening with a geophone the tunnel could not be located,-   The entrance was constructed most skilfully and defied detection though the particular, hut from which it started had been constantly inspected.   The Commandant in his evidence before the Court of Enquiry states &quot;On the 28th&quot; (the esoape took place on the 24th) &quot;I took the Deputy Chief Constable, of Leicester into this-hut and placed him within 3 feet of the mouth of the tunnel and asked him to see: if he could find if the boards had been, tampered-with.-  He could find nothing.though he was some considerable&apos;time searching&quot;. &apos;- Constant endeavour had been made to find where the earth from the. suspected tunnel&apos;was being placed,-but without result, and it-was notvuntil the Foreman of Works who built Kegworth College was consulted that he suggested the possibility of its having been placed over.the floor of the lecture room,-although it could there . only be supported by lath and plaster.   Examination was made and the earth was discovered widely scattered..   This space was not known until the Foreman suggested it, &apos;-ITo tools were used according to the evidence of prisoners who escaped as it was impossible for them to obtain them, and they did the whole of the work in sandy soil, excavating a tunnel about 40 yards long and 2*6H high by means of improvised tools such as a jam pot and a piece of zinc shaped like a trowel, 1The escape took place during an air raid alarm when all lights were extinguished,Owing to the restriction of coins other than copper being allowed in officers&apos; camps the prisoners had very little money in their possession with the exception of One man, who on arrival had biven his word- of honour that he had none in his possession and was accordingly not very carefully searched.-   This man had&apos; 7.Ho satisfactory explanation has been given.of the means by which they/-obtained anything in the shape of plain clothes except in the case of&quot; the naval officers who were able to remove their buttons and so turn their uniform into something very closely resembling civilian clothes, --The compasses which a few men had appear to hare been constructed with metal cut off a lightning conductor and the maps were well executed by hand.    It remains to be seen.how they obtained the original map from which they made copies.It
It took six days tq appr^eh-end alJL these e-scapes^The food of.which they were in possession had all. arrived in parcels from Germany.The statement that they were in possession of extra clothoi appears to &quot;be incorrect.It is probable that the map tracing was made from one of the many maps which appear from time to time in the newspapers.The numbers of prisoners who have escaped from time to time from Prisoners1 Camps in England compares very favourably with the position in other countries.   For instance:   at the present-moment there are some 242 German Prisoners of War loose in Prance &quot;belonging to the French Prisoners of Afar Camps,Between June 1916 and June 1917, 2,479 Russians have escaped from Germany and reached England, while22 British Officers and 119 other ranks have escaped from Germany to England.Out of 2,020 German officers and 42,815 German soldiers interned in the United Kingdom on the 3rd October, only 1 officer and 2 other ra:i::s are known to have escaped and reached Germany.At the same time it must be remembered that owing to the necessity for cutting down all extraneous guards to the lowest possible limit on account of the shortage of men for the Army, it is possible that the vigilance of the Prisoner of War guards is less than formerly, and further, the men employed on these guards are generally old&apos; men of low physical categories.The whole of those who escaped were recaptured within6 days.Suitable action is being taken with regard to thisincident...DERBY.5th October, 1917.
