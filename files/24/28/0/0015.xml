(This Document is the Pmn^fy of Ooloml Jones His Britannic MalestvM WMINISTRY Of HEALTH:    DRAJTT^lLL PHEJ^ARID BTINSTTRAHCE OBGAM SATI02J8.0 0.The representatives of the Insurance World have presented to the Prime Minister a long memorandum on the subject of a Ministry if Health, and have supplemented it with a draft of a Bill which they suggest should &quot;be intro-duoed by the Government as soon as the Autumn Session begins and passed into law with the utmost expedition.   A copy ef the Bill has now been circulated by the War Cabinet, but my colleagues in the Government should understand that it has no official sanction.   My Department has never been consulted upon it, although its proposals affect it vitally.   Indeed, it would create a revolution in Local Government adninistra-tion, and that without any of the Local Authorities or their Central Representative Bodies having been consulted or even apprised of such an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Bill is admittedly only part of.a larger scheme. It is stated that &quot;another measure will be necessary in order that suitable provision may be made for the co-ordination &amp;f local health services of the country&quot;.   The present measure, with certain exceptions, deals only with &quot;what is called Central Government Machinery&quot;.   Presumably there will also be needed a third Bill outlining the policy which is to be pursued after the war in the very important matter of health and the cure of disease, but no suggestion is so far made on this point.The suggested pill is certainly a large and not a small measure, and will undoubtedly prove intensely contro-versial in its scope and character.   It proposes -(l)   To create a new Minister of Cabinet rank with a paid advisory committee attached to him.(2)   To dismember tw? Departments at once, and toprovide for the transfer of functions of other Departments hereafter by Order in Council.(3) To make a beginning with the break up of the poor law (a subject which is at present engaging the attention of a Government Committee).(4)   To deal drastically with the hospital service of the country, including charitable trusts con-nected with such hospitals.(5)   To make effective provision for compelling local authorities to control excessive sickness.I feel it necessary to say at once that any proposals which involve the separation of the public health work - strictly so described - of the Local Government Board and the Local Sanitary Authorities from their other functions, especially those conneoted with Housing, Sewerage, Water Supply, Town Planning, Road making, alteration of Local Government Areas, etc., are, in my opinion, based on a radical misconception of the problem of Public Health.Whatever may be the future of the Public Health services of the Country, they must always be indissolubly connected with local government in its widest sense, and I
have no hesitation in saying that the only sound basis for an adequate and progressive Public Health policy lies in the natural development of the work already performed by the local authorities and my Department, a development which, given a free hand, I am determined to foster by all means at my disposal.   In fact, as is known to my colleagues large extensions of the health activities of the looal authorities aided by State grants would have been realised but for the War.Furthermore, I regard it as a first principle of sound finance, and one that the House of Commons will insist upon, that the expenditure of public funds, whether wholly derived from rates, or partly from rates and partly from Imperial sources, must be in the hands of the duly elected local authorities, although the exeoutive Committees of those authorities might be strengthened by oo-option.It is evident also that the proposed Bill touches a variety of other public interests, and would certainly require far more time for its discussion than is likely to be available in the busy Autumn Session that lies before us.But apart from this, the proposal enbodied in the Bill seems to be an attempt to tackle the problem at the wrong end.   Much has been said recently about a Ministry of Health. But what is far more important is a Policy of Health.   When that is settled, the organisation, central and local, to carry it into effect will have to be determined, and, by whatever name called, the Central Organisation will be the Ministry of Health.    It is a mere common plaice of statesmanship that polioy should be first devised and subsequently the machinery to administer it.   The proposal of the Insurance organisations reverses this process.From the memorandum forwarded it is evident that the branch of public health which chiefly attracts the Insurance World is that concerned with the treatment of sickness and the cure of disease.   This branch is one which haB developed on somewhat irregular lines, but, although this is so and the whole field cf action is not completely covered, it may be questioned whether in any civilised State, the public supply of medical Bervice, and the other branch cf Public Health, naq&amp;ely sanitary administration and control, are more effective-ly,developed than here.   The last word has, however, not been said and an important problem for the Government to determine is what part the State, whether acting through central or local organisations, is to take in providing for the health of its citizens in the future.In the treatment of the individual there has-been some lack of co-ordination.    To begin with, there is the vast organisation of medical benefit under the Insurance Act, administered centrally by the Insurance CoramisBioners, and locally by the panel doctors acting under the Insurance Committees.   Then there is the provision made by local authorities under the Local Government Board for treatment of infectious diseases, of tuberculosis, of venereal disease, and some other diseases and the establishment of schemes fer maternity and child welfare.    There is the school medical service, with free treatment for scholars that require it, set up by Lccal Education Authorities under the Board of Education.   There is also the treatment of the sick under tht Poor Law Authorities.   Mere recently there has come into being the machinery of Local Pension Committees constituted by Local Authorities under the Ministry of Pensions^ part of
i^hose functions consists in the provision o*- suitable medical treatment for disabled soldiers and sailors.   In addition te these official organisations, there are of course the great general hospitals and a variety of charitable agencies whioh provide medical treatment.With the exception of the poor law and the hospitals for infectious.disease, it may be stated that the whole of the State provision for the cure and treatment of disease has been a product of the present century.   The question is how much further is the State activity in this direction to develop^ Are we to contemplate a universal State Medical Service, and, if so, on what lines is it to proceed?   Is it to be on a gratuitous or on a contributory basis?   Is it to extend to indoor as well as outdoor treatment?   lhat is to be the position of the daotors under the scheme?   Is it ta be administered centrally or locally?   If locally, what is the local machinery to be?   Above all what is to be the finance of any such scheme?   tfhat are to be the respective contribu-ticns from the Exchequer, the rates and the private purse of the individual citizen?   On this, the Authors of the Bill are significantly eilant.All these questions will inevitably be raised by the introduction of a Bill for the creation of a Ministry of Health.   Already the project of a Ministry of Health has aroused much curiosity, but the points of real public interest are not whether the Ministry shall be formed by the fusion of the Lccal Government Board and the Insurance Commission, or by tha establishment of a new Department altogether, nor whether this or that branch of the central administration shall be absorbed or not.   What Parliament and the public will want to know is what is to be the range of action of any such department, and the cost it may involve, what its effect is to be upon the public, upon the local authorities, upon the medical profession, upon the Insurance Committees and upon the approved societies;   in short, what is the policy which the Government have in view and whither it is leading.   These are the questions to which answers will be sought if a Ministry of Health Bill is introduced, and it seems to me essential that we should have answers ready to suoh questions before legislation is proposed.   For this purpose it is in my vie?,&apos; clearly necessary that a Government inquiry of a comprehensive character should be instituted.The construction by the Government of a Ministry cf Health will raise expectations in the people of the establishment of a system of free Medical Service, both ordinary and special, both domiciliary and institutional, whioh, qnite apart from the extra millions of money involved, will be impossible to meet at the present time or even in the near future on account of the drainage of the ordinary supply of doctors, nurses, etc., caused by the war, and of the financial, material and labour difficulties in enlarging tha number of institutions and sanatoria.There is, however, one piece of legislation in regard to Public Health whioh is already long overdue and must not be further delayed, and that is a small measure enabling the existing local authorities to make full provision for carrying into effect their schemes of maternity and ohild welfare.   This measure has. been hotly opposed by the persons who are responsible for this Bill, who have feigned to regard it as a large measure of public health reform.    It is in fact nothing of the sort.    Its Whcle object is to remove some small imperfections in the present
law in England and Wales, and te make that law coincide with the itatutes operative in gpeetland m$ Irelondo   tft^e^ imptr-ffctloot &quot;though mil, de material^ 4m$aX* tut uatfui&amp;etfr of the work whieh is new being dene and ought&quot; to be remeyedeX therefore wish to urge that tht Maternity and Child Welfare Bill, whioh has already been before the Cabinet, should he brought in and passed.On the general question,   wish to observe that the only prinaipie whioh is oeaaaon to all demands for the creation of a Ministry of Health is that&apos;all important health questions should, as far as praotioable, be&apos; placed under sne Chief Minister, through whom all questions ree.uir-ing Government deoieion should reach the Cabinet.This prinoiple Is in ay opinion quite sound and might be adopted at once, hut until the large questions of polioy which are indicated above have been fully inquired into and agreed on ne further change than this should be made, and unless and until the Znsuranoe Act is radically altered the Insurance Commissioners and Insurance Committees should be continued for the purpose of administering the insurance services whioh are limited to -(a) $he dispensation of oash benefit;(b) the provision of a general practitioner servicefor .insured persons; and(o)   making arrangements for the treatment in sanatoria &apos; or otherwise of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis.Subject to this, I recommend that the whole question of the detelopment of the health servioes of the Country be referred to a strong and representative Committee which should be instructed to report expeditiouely.IT.
