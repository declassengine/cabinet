SECRET. o-G.T. 2227,WAR CABINET COI-UJITION OF IRELAND. Weekly Report &quot;by the Chief Seor tary for Ireland...A period of extreme anxiety for all concerned in the government of Ireland inevitably followed on the.death of Thomas Ashe in Mountjoy Prison.     When I returned to Dublin a. week age a serious st&amp;te -of tension was so apparent that I deubted whether some violent demonstration would not take place in connection with the lying-in-state and funeral of the dead prisoner.     Before leaving London I had had an opportunity of discussing the situation with the Prime Minister, with such knowledge as I then had, though without information, from wnich I could gauge the extent of the risk of public csmmotion.     After my arrival hgre, consultations vdth the General Officer Commanding, various members of the Executive, the Lord Mayor of Dublin,  and otners, led me te a definite conclusion that the treatment as. ordinary criminals of the Sinn 3?ein prisoners imprisoned fer offences against Defence of the Realm Regulations could net be continued without incurring risks even myre serious than those which led to the arrest and imprisonment of these men.      I therefore took the steps toward a change of treatment of which I informed the War Cabinet at the beginning of. the week.      The publieatisn by the Lord Mayor of the information I gave him upon the subject and his personal communications with the prisoners as a Visiting Justice which led to their definite abandonment of their fast, quieted the: excitement which had prevailed in the City -and the tremendous demonstration of papular feeling which was evoked by the funeral passed a^ay without any incident of violence.     The City has since been in a purely normal condition so far as public order is concerned.     A certain number of man wore &quot;volunteer&quot; uniforms in this procession, and some rifles were smuggled into the Cemetery for the firing of a funeral
-r 2 -salute, bbotri^y^^ of D. of R. Re^ulstti-cnsr,but I recommended Sir Bryan Mahon not to take-notaoo -od^-them by prosecutions and I have :seen no reason to doubt that this course was well-advised.     The Dublin police were, unable to identify or keep touch with the men who formed the firing party or to follow the arms, which was to be regretted.but was not surprising , in.&apos;the conditions which existed.    - -     - ,.Looking&apos;back upon this most unfortunate event,  Ian disposed to think that whan the.line of action was resolved upon which result-od in express.prohibitions of drilling and of the other minor revolu-tionary activities, of Sinn Fein,:with the. inevitable result of pro-secutions and imprisonments, I ought perhaps to have foreseen the conflict which would arise-, between the prisoners and the prison authorities. -   If I had known - but I did net - that the Irish prison system would have&quot; brought all these prisoners together in a Dublin prison as the choice of the English Government brought the prisoners of the rebellion together last year at Lewes, for treatment apart from ordinary criminals, I might have anticipated the trouble which .arose.-   So far as I am able- to judge and so far as I know the views of well-informed Irishmen, the Ashe- incident has not seriously affect-ed the prospects of the Convention.      It has given an impetus to revolutionary feeling,  stimulated the activity of the Sinn Fein organisers and added to the numbers of the. Sinn Fein Cluba.     I do not find among those who. inform me about popular opinion any belief that it has as yet given any new permanent force to the revolutionary move-ment.During the week I have been considering with Sir Bryan Mali on and the&quot;chiefs of police whether some modification ought to be made in the system under which prosecutions for infringements of the various D. of R. Regulations have been.instituted.     If it were poss-ible to trust local justices to deal with such cases one serious
diff^iculty * WuldT^e^removed.^     That thi-er- could..jicK T^-dxrrie-ia-agreed by everyone who knows the &apos;pres^ni^---oJiaracter of the Irish magistracy in the rural districts.     There is not now, however,- any wide-spread prevalence of drilling.      I doubt too whether the revolutionary and republican propaganda is gaining ground.     Sir Bryan LEahon will not &quot;rake action as competent military authority except where there are really serious grounds for it, and in otner cases no prosecution will be instituted without express direction giv&amp;n after cohsidera-tion of the facts by the Attorney General.Information which I have received from various quarters persuades me that there is ho agreement yet&apos;among the Sinn Fein leaders upon any definite line of action-.      They have announced their intention to hold a &quot;convention&quot; in Dublin on October 25th, which may be an event of some seriousness.     Before the date is reached it is possible I may be in a position to submit some observations with regard to it for the consideration of the War Cabinet.(initialled) H. h. D.6/10/17.
