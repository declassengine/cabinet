VERY SECRET.RECRUITING     POSITION. THE PROBLEM cc PROSPECTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF NAT 101-AL SERVICL.13.10,17,Part 1.STATISTICAL REVIEW.On the assumption that the casualties to be incurred by the Military Forces in the year 1st October 1917 - 30th September 1918 will be the same in number as those Incurred in the year 1st October 1916 - 30th September 1917, and that the formation of new units during the same period will absorb approximately 110,000 men, the position appears to be as follows:-1.

Part li.The Civil Reservoir.The males of all ages remaining in civil life now number 8,000,000;    of these approximately 3,600,000 are of military age.     The health condition of these men, speaking broadly, Is bad.   For over three years a process cf creaming off the population has proceeded.    An result a relatively very low percentage of the men remaining are fit for Category A..Further the fitter of those who remain are engaged in Coal and Iron Stone Mining, in and about Shipyards, in Munition (including Aeroplane) &quot;&apos;orks   and in Agriculture, on Railways, etc..   The natural result of the process of re-cruiting has been to leave fit men in civil life only in occupations of vital importance..It follows that the recruiting position is now extrerely difficult.   The supply of labour for certain essential Industries, for example, shipbuilding so soon as steel becomes available, will require to be increased not diminished.   The expansion of the Air Services will recuire the provision cf more labour in civil life.Further, as a result of the campaign to increase food production, it is almost impossible to withdraw men from Agriculture,, in spite of the fact that In patches there Is surplus lubcur in Agriculture (e-g. in ,?:&amp;les.)The temper of certain of the great Trade Unions, or at all events sections of the great Unions, e.g. South Vales Miners Federation, is actively hostile to further recruiting.   There are al^c areas in which recruiting is txtremcly difficult owing to active opposition, e.g, Shef-fitld, barrow,.Woolwich.,  Everything is being dene tc remove
legitimate grievances about the&quot; inequality of the-work of tbe Recruiting Machinery; but there arc sufficient people&apos; convinced that it is being, worked unintelligently or in the interest of sections of the population to make it tho object of unending criticism and complaint.Tho question of recruiting lads at 18 is also of importance.     Early in this year it was decided to recruit lads at 18 years and one month instead of at 18 years and 7 months as had formerly been the practice.      This was done to secure early in the year a body of young men who would form an ultimate reserve at home in the event of it becoming suddenly necessary to add a considerable block of trained men to the forces in the fluid,None of these is supposed to have proceeded over-seas; and it is understood that it has been definitely decided by tho &quot;&quot;ar Office to send no soldier Overseas until ho is 19 years of age.If this be the case, it becomes necessary to con-sider whether it is not better to raise the age of re-cruit-ment to 18 years and 8 months, and to allow the lads to remain at *o*lt in civil life until that age is reached.    If it were certain that the war would end in 1918, it would obviously be better to leave the lads at work in civil life; but even if it were certain that the war would not end before 1920, it is definitely open to argument th. t it is more in the national interest to raise the age of recruiting to 18 years and b monthsvIn view of the great shortage of labour in civil
life I have formed the opinion that on the balance ofadvantage and disadvantage it, is just preferabfc&amp;eto leavethe lads in civil life until they are 18 years and 8 monthsold, provided always that the War Office has definitelydecided that under no reasonably possible conditions willthey send soldiers under nineteen overseas, and also providedthat it may be made a definite Cabinet order that no Govern-ment Department in any circumstances whatever exempts orapplies for exemption for any lad cf 18 years, unless hehas passed through a trade apprenticeship in one of themetal working craftscThe following figures are of Importance:-Total males in civil life approximately     8,000,COO11        &quot;     of military age incivil life .... 3,600,000&quot;        &quot;     of 18-25 years incivil life approximately 800,000Estimated total of males of 18-25   &apos;years in civil life fit for Category A 270,000.Of these 270,000 young men, approximately 90,000 are engaged in coal mines;    100,000 In and about shipyards, marine engineering shops, and munitions works (including some of the most highly skilled men at their trades);   70,000 are employed in Agriculture, Railways, Transport,-Trades;   The remaining 10,000 are scattered under various headings and cannot be counted on for the Army to any extent0At the outside 150,000 - 160,000 of these young men It is estimated can be obtained for the Army if the younger lads are left in civil life and if the older men are not tec heavily drawn on,    It is further estimated that it will take 8 months to recruit them.
Of the 2,800-,000 older men. cf-military^age^orily  about 700,000 are fit for Category A,These are nearly all engaged in vital industries. In 8 months it is estimated 120,000 may be recruited.    That gives a total of 270,000 - 280,000 recruit-able category A. men remaining in civil life and a period of 8 months necessary to secure their recruitment;   but even to secure this modest result it will be necessary to face boldly the existing active opposition to recruiting and to accept the risk, almost the certainty, of a serious strike in the South Wales Coalfield,.Ireland remains a source to be tapped,   The British System of Recruiting with its elaborate machinery of tribunals is quite inapplicable tc Ireland,     It seems necessary there-fore if anything is to be done to fall back on the ballot system,   Without endangering food production it is estimated that 150,000 men can be obtained from Ireland by compulsory methods,Britain and Ireland can therefore, it is estimated, be relied on to yield 420,000 - 430,000 recruits in the 12 months 1.10.17 - 30,9,18 without raising the military age,If compulsion cannot be applied to Ireland, raising the military age of compulsion to 50 in this country will yield approximately 150,000 fit men in 6 months.In addition tc the suggestions advanced in Part iii, I therefore propose that a vigorous campaign- to prepare the country for the raising of the military age be at once under-taken, and that legislation to raise the age be introduced immediately before Christmas.   &quot;:ithout applying compulsion tc Ireland the Army cannot be maintained next year unless the age be- raised.
Part ill.General Considerations.At the present time a most difficult aspect of the Man-Power problem is the psychological.    The original enthusiasm for active participation in the war has wholly departed.   England especially is bored with the drab mono-tony of the last three years.   The vast majority of the working classes are in need of strong stimulation.    They are tired;    food is dear;    the streets are dark;    even important military successes are ignored so far as public aation is concernedcMuch good I am convinced could be done by public celebration cf the next and all future successes.    The feel-ing that the war is passing tc a happier phase would I believe do more tc ease recruiting than anything else.The working class as a whole are, I am convinced, as a result of widespread contact with representative members of their Unions and Societies, no less determined than any other class to fight on to the endc   They do net however understand In the lease the financial position of the country or the inevitability of a fall in the value cf money as a result of a long continued war..    There appears to me to be every reason to tell the country the truth and to call on the people to  accept the position.Further it is neces -.ary to secure the greatest possible movement cf uselessly employed men and women into useful employment So    Apart from a mass of young women of the middle class and from a smaller mass of domestic ser- &apos; vants in large households our reserves of human power are practically fully absorbed in national work,     To effect the recruitment of the  extra men necessary to maintain....---
% Q CSouA.  C. GEDDES.the Army If it Is to be maintained It is absolutely essential to secure the mobilisation of these two masses. There are no figures to shew precisely their number.    It is hoped shortly to obtain accurate knowledge&apos;.    In the meantime their number has been put approximately at 50,000. Further it is absolutely essential that the staffs cf Government Offices, Services and Undertakings should be carefully reviewed.   There is reason to believe that there is an appreciable, amount of incompletely employed labour in many of   them.    Finally a general appeal should be issued generally to the country and particularly to every employer to cut staffs to a minimum.  &apos;These apparently trifling points are put forward to indicate generally how close to the limit of its human resources the whole country, apart from the mining industry, is approaching.   Only by universal economy In human power can we hope to meet the demands of the services without checking essential production in civil life.
APPENDIX   1.Tho following i3 a report of tho results of an investigation made in connection with throe well defined blocks of casualties, lye.     Neuve-Chapelie, Loos, and the early days of the fighting on the Scmme in July 1916.
The experience and ultimate distribution cf men returned from France as a result of battle wounds, were traced as carefully as possible from the more or less inadequate data available. ... Similar investigations were mad% in connection with men returned from France as a result of sickness.The difficulties met with in dealing with the data supplied by Record Offices clearly demonstrate the need for a properly equipped Statistical Department manned by men of proper technical qualifications.Tho particulars were supplied to us by Record Offices on the instructions of A.G.I. and in order to satisfy eurselves as to tho accuracy of the information supplied to us it would have been necessary tc question the greater pro-portion of the entries submitted to us.     There were a great many cases of evident errors, and undoubtedly there were many more which were not so easily apparent.Again, there wore many cases of transfers to other Regiments and in oach case the particulars given were vory incomplete, it having apparently been impossible under pros-, ent conditions to follow the experience of the man In quos-tlon after his transfer.In a great many cases the date on which a man Is said to havo become fit again for G..S. is evidently the date on which he was classified &quot;A(iii)&quot;, while in almost as many other cases the date on which the man re-embarked for- service-Overseas was apparently given as the date on which he became fit again for G.S..In view of the foregoing remarks it will be quite-evident that tho following results must bo taken as being subject to very considerable qualification.
