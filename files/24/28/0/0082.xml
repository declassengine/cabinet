Wilson   ) Committee cn Production ISir Lyndon Macassey    Admiralty.Secretaries: -Mr,        Hodgson Capt. Ormsby&quot; Gore,M.P.The Ministry of Munitions explained that the proposed increase would be the remedy for a well recognised and substantial grievance, affecting those skilled workers wnose employment necessitated their working on time rates and who could not be employed upon piece work.    It was not the case that any&apos; specific demand had boon put forward by tho men affectod. but in this matter ho had. come forward before&quot; any menacing or threatening attitude had arisen, in order to meet what ho considered to be a legitimate grievance.When he had appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Major Hills * going into tho uhole matter, he had hoped that it would have been possible to make no increase in wages or any bonus deponent upon output, but after careful examinationj the Committee- found that owang to the specialihe of- _________      - ______ ______ --Tnings.    Tiie formermight doubtless &quot;be represented as an increase designed to meet the increased cost of living and as such might form a precedent

He thereforo, agreed with the Committee, that the best means of remedying tins clearly defined grievanco on tho part of&quot; the skilled time workers, was to give a bonus upon earnings, which principlo would tend to increase production&apos;and would limit the possibility of similar demands being made by other types *f workers*    He pointed out that thoro were two alternative schemes now before tho Members af tho Cabinet to whom this matter had boon referred for decision.,gchomp 1,   hi increase of 1 % upon the earnings of a selected class of skilled time workers.

He preferred tho 12a% increase to the 15%,It was pointed out that the cost to the State would be approximately the same, viz:-   about  8,000,000 a year*Sir David Shacklcton on behalf of the Ministry of Labour concurred in the view with tho 12i$ increase that, voider ea/begory was preferable to the 16% increase on tho narrower schedule.Lord Milnor and Mr. Barnes decided:-That fully qualified skilled time workers in the Engineering and Foundry Trades should be granted an increase of 12-g% uoon their wookly earnings, provided that their wages oquallcd or oxoeouod tho district time rato payablo to fitters and turners,,   Such increase to commence in bhe first full week a/fter October 14th 1917o   This incroa.se shall not apply to men with upstanding wago or salary covering overtime.-Sir George Askwith.expressed a vrish that it bo placed ra record that his presence did&apos;not imply concurrence with the decision arrived atuSir Lynden Macassoy also desired that his dissont should be recorded.(Init)    M..1 .
