I This Document is the Property of270His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)SEilpfT^Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.WEEKLY REPORT OK RUSSIA. XXIV.CRI/024.(8 October, 1917 ).The Democratic Conference.The last fortnight has been perhaps the quietest period in Russia since the Revolution,     It has witnessed the first attempt of the Socialists to organise a Government and a Parliament without the co-operation of the bourgeois parties, and it has proved the impossibility of realising the motto of the Maximalists:   &quot;All power to the Sovyets&quot;.     After the Kornilov episode Kerenski found himself in the desperate position of having to cancel his previous efforts to form a Government supported by Kornilov and having to begin all over again.     His first step was to give the Sovyet an opportunity of reviewing the situation as a whole and making suggestions for the future.     In calling together the various democratic organisations Kerenski did not confine the invitation to the Sovyets, but widened the basis of representation by appealing to the Zemstvos and the Co-operative Societd.es, the two organisations which, while thoroughly democratic, are essentially practical.     By doing this he averted the danger of a Maximalist majority, though he could not secure support for his own ideas or induce the Conference to adopt any consistent policy. After a week spent in passing contradictory resolutions Kerenski, supported by Tsereteli, decided to act as he thought fit and to override the decisions of the Conferen6e, while meeting them half wKerenski has always stood for a Coalition Government - not a Coalition of Socialist parties, but of Socialist and Bourgeois. He has never consented to break off relations with the Cadets,
who are far and away the most important of the &quot;bourgeois parties. Hitherto the moderate majority in the Sovyet has agreed to the inclusion of the Cadets, but the Kornilov affair created suspicions and misunderstandings, which led to the unmeaning resolution of a Coalition without the Cadets.It is as yet impossible to say how far the Cadets were implicated in the Kornilov affair.     Probably some members of the party lent their active support, while others secretly hoped for Kornilov&apos;s success, but the party as a whole has never associated itself with any movement that could fairly be described as counter-revolutionary.     Had Kerenski made a full statement about the whole affair, he might have been able to remove many suspicions and exculpate the Cadets from any share in the movement.     It seems surprising that, if he wished to include Cadets in his Government, he did not go out of his way to justify them in the eyes of the Democratic Conference.     The whole Kornilov affair remains wrapped in mystery, and one cannot help feeling that up to a point Kerenski and Savinkov were at one with Kornilov, and only turned against him at the last moment when they found that Kornilov was in the hands cf men they could not trust.     Had Kerenski explained this he might have got himself into fresh difficulties with the Sovyet and lost further prestige.     Considering that at the present moment there is no one who can apparently replace him, his policy may be justifiedIt may veil prove a blessing that the Democratic Conference has ended In a fiasco.   Had it succeeded it would presumably have meant some sort of compromise between Kerenski and the moderateSocialists on the one hand, and the Maximalists on the other.oSuch a compromise wpuld have been quite unreal and could only have ended in disaster, for the simple reason that no necessary measures for restoring order would ever have been allowed to pass unchallenged
c% (\ I ilThe Maximalists have all along made it perfectly clear that theyare &quot;irreconcilables&quot;,   and the sooner the Moderate Socialiststreat them as such the stronger will he their own position.     Therecan he little doubt left in the minds of practical men in Russia-fthat the only way o% saving the Revolution is for all the moderate parties - Socialist and Bourgeois - to combine against the extreme Left.     Unfortunately there is still a party represented by Chernov which, without actually joining the Maximalists, endeavours to keep the balance between the Right and Left of the Socialists, This leads to a policy of obstruction and little else, and, so long as Chernov exercises any influence over the Government, the bourgeois parties will fight ahy of it.The Position of the New Government.The personnel of the new Government has not yet been decided upon, but it seems clear that it will be a Socialist-Cadet Coalition. Probably several members of Kerenski&apos;s former Government will return,though Socialists of the type    of Tsereteli and Avksentyev may wellsprefer to remain in the Provisional Parliament so as to control its decisions.    It is still uncertain y/ho will represent the Cadets. Probably Kerenski will look to Moscow for support, as he has always found the Moscow Cadets more ready to agree to his terms.     If he can induce leading Moscow merchants and bankers of the type of Konovalov, Tretyakov and Kishkin to join him, he will do a great deal to restore a feeling of security.Whatever the personnel of the new Government, the point that really matters is the question of responsibility.     The experience of the last few months has shown that no Government can exist, if it is to be held responsible to a partially-representative body such as the Sovyet.       The Sovyet has been merely destructive;   it
has shown no constructive ability and is to be replaced, without being abolished, by a Provisional Parliament.    The latter, however, Is to be purely consultative, the Government having full legislative powers but drawing its moral support from the confidence of this Parliament.The result of such a compromise will be to drive the Sovyets into the hands of the extreme Left, who will tend to boycott the Parliament and concentrate upon the Sovyets in Petrograd and Moscow. Whether the new Government, with the moral support of its new Parliament, can overcome the Sovyets after the new elections for the latter on November 2, remains to be seen.     It may not have, during the winter, the constant embarrassment of fresh military failures, but it will be faced by economic difficulties still more formidable perhaps than the military ones of last summer.     The sooner the Government is organised the better, for the food and transport questions will become especially acute from November, when Russia Is denied the use of her numerous waterways and has to depend entirely upon her already disorganised railways.8.10.17.
