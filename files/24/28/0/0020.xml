Colonel Jones[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty!s Government.]3d1Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 19. Week ended 30th September.NAVAL OPERATIONS.There are no important movements of any of the enemy fleets to record, but reports Enemy-indicate that the Germans have part of their fleet in the Baltic to carry out some Fleets, operation against Russia.   There is at present insufficient information to name the point of attack but it appears probable that a movement of transports, carrying troops, is contemplated.Minelaying operations were carried out in the Heligoland Bight and off the Belgian British Coast, and a deep minefield was laid off S.W. Coast of England. &apos;     Minelaying.Two drifters have been blown up and sunk by mines, and a flotilla leader and two Casualties, destroyers were also mined, but all reached port safely.On the 25th September the monitor &quot; Terror &quot; bombarded Ostend naval establishment, Flandersseveral direct hits being observed on the naval workshops and docks. and Doverarea.R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aerodromes at Varssenaere, Houttave, Sparappelhoek and St. Denis Westrem on 3 occasions; also on Gontrode airship shed, railway junctions at Thourout, Lichtervelde and Cortemarck, and on Zeebrugge locks. The total weight of bombs dropped was over 21 tons. In the raid on Zeebrugge about 4 tons of bombs were dropped on the locks, and it is believed that the North Lock was destroyed.R.N.A.S. patrols from Dunkirk have, definitely destroyed one enemy machine, driven one down completely out of control, and driven down two.During the enemy air raid on S.E. coast on the evening of the 28th, the &quot; Marshal Ney&quot; reports having probably brought down an enemy machine and Port Victoria guns claim to have brought down another.One of our seaplanes from Dunkirk failed to return from patrol and of two aeroplanes and one seaplane which were flown from &quot; Vindex&quot; to attack Zeppelins, one aeroplane is missing and the seaplane was picked up by the Dutch.In the air raid on Dunkirk on the night of the 25th, a fire was caused at our Aircraft Depot by enemy bombs, the engine repair shop and machine shop being destroyed, involving the loss of all machinery, spare engines and engines under repair.The cruiser &quot; Grafton &quot; shelled a shed on the Mole at Beirut on the 27th and on the Syria, same day other sheds were bombed by seaplanes.   In each case fires were caused.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.The number of large enemy submarines believed to have been operating during the Number of week is 20 to 22.   Most of these have operated in the Atlantic, but their activity has submarines been comparatively limited.   From reports which have been received, it would appear 0Peratmg-&apos; that submarines are being detailed to work well out in the Atlantic in the hope of meeting the convoys before they are joined by destroj^ers from Home bases.    Several reports have been received of submarines being sighted 200 miles west to north-west of Cape Finisterre.The number of encounters with enemy submarines in Home Waters shows an Actions increase, and two submarines have certainly been destroyed this week.   In addition, with enemy during the week reports have been received of the probable destruction of a submarine submarines, in each of the weeks ended 9th and 23rd of September.(c 667)   50   10/17  h &amp; s
The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home Waters during recent weeks and the nature of the craft which have engaged them, the numbers of results having been adjusted to include those subsequently reported : Nature of Craft.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.These successes against enemy submarines in recent weeks, with the consequent reduction in their number and effect on the morale of enemy crews, doubtless account to a considerable extent for the satisfactory results shown in the next table.MERCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.Number The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchantand tonnage Vessels sunk in recent weeks by Submarine and Mine :  of all vessels	British Vessels.

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of Losses oflosses by Submarine and Mine of British Merchant Steamships of over 500 tons gross British- ,    J steamships,register. rThe tonnage of British Vessels lost this week, again and for the third, week in succession, constitutes a record since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare. The British tonnage lost for the last week in September (the week under review) is very little more than one-third of that lost during the last week in August. On the other hand, the percentage of losses to sailings of British Steamships to and from the United Kingdom, while showing a great improvement on last week is not yet down to the lowest on record, as the total tonnage afloat again shows a considerable reduction. Indeed, the total British tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports this week is just over a million, whereas three weeks ago it exceeded a million and a half.The tonnage of Allied and Neutral Vessels lost this week is also the lowest on record during the period of unrestricted submarine warfare.The table in Appendix II is a comparative Statement of all British Merchant Areas in Vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk which in the last two weeks by submarine and mine according to  areas, and that in vessels lost-Appendix III shows by routes as regards British Merchant Steamships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine or mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last two months.The former table indicates the comparatively small success which now attends the enemy&apos;s operations in the Atlantic, the casualties inflicted being mainly in Home Waters and in the Mediterranean, only one British Vessel and one small Neutral Vessel having been sunk in the Atlantic (outside Home Waters) during last week.From the latter table it appears that the percentage of tonnage sunk to tonnage sailing in the week under review compares favourably with the average for the whole of September, and is less than one half of the average percentage for the month of August.ENEMY MINES.The week under review has been quiet, the principal activity being on the South-East Coast of England. Two drifters and two merchant vessels, one being a dredger, have been lost by mine in Home Waters during the week.The following Table shows the number of Enemy Mines destroyed and British Vessels sunk by mine in recent weeks : Week Ended.

Of these Convoy. 814,107 were on the inward convoy, 80 on the outward convoy, 171 on the Scandinavia  Berwick Humber route, and 456 were engaged in the French coal trade. There are no reports of convoyed vessels having been sunk or torpedoed during the week, but 2 ships of the Gibraltar inward convoy were sunk in the week ended .the 23rd ultimo which were not referred to in last week&apos;s Appreciation.During the week 48 additional merchant vessels were fitted for defensive armament, Defensive bringing the net number now fitted up to 3,296.   The number of guns now available armament, amounts to 2,958.During the week 49 additional Merchant Ships have been fitted with Otter equip- Mine ment, bringing the total number so fitted to 483.   The number of Warships now fitted Protection with Paravane equipment is 268.   Three cases have been reported during the week in gear&quot; which mines have been cut by protective Otters.

None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.Raider. Further information has been received with respect to the operations of the motorsailing vessel &quot; Seeadler.&quot; About the 18th of April she appears to have rounded Cape Horn into the Pacific, and subsequently captured and sunk three American schooners. On the 2nd of August she ran on the reef at Mopeha, Society Islands. The Captain, one Officer and four hands left in a motor launch on the 23rd of August,, and were from time to time reported off various islands until they were finally captured at Wakaya, Fiji, on the 21st September.The French trading schooner &quot; Luteogist&quot; arrived at Mopeha on the 5th of September and was captured by the remainder of the &quot; Seeadler&apos;s &quot; crew who embarked in her the next day, taking with them machine guns, rifles and bombs, and leaving 27 whites and 70 natives marooned. The &quot; Luteogist &quot; having left Mopeha on the 6th of September was reported as being off Suva, Fiji, on the 21st ultimo.ENEMY WARSHIP CONSTRUCTION.The following tables show the position of German and Austro-Hungarian Warship Construction at the present date : -German.

In the latter case all the crew were saved, and it is hoped to salve the boat, operations but the i  Okhotnik &quot; lost all her officers and crew, except 11 men. and losses-There has been considerable aerial activity in the Gulf of Riga on the part of the Germans. During the night of the 25/26 September the south-west coast of Osel was twice attacked by Zeppelins, but the result is unknown.Russian submarines and T.B.D.s, supported by aircraft, are reported to be denying approach to the Gulf of Riga through the western channel.The British submarines have now shifted their base to Hango on the south west coast British of Finland. &apos; Submarines.Italy.On 23rd September four enemy T.B.D.s attacked Italian Coastal T.B.s which were Minor accompanying a seaplane near Istria.   They were driven off by Italian aircraft after firing 0Perations. five shots. On the same day 22 bombs were dropped on Grado by enemy aircraft, causing one casualty and no damage.    On September 27th seven Italian seaplanes attacked the hangars at Prosecco, north of Trieste, dropping 23 torpedoes, 14 incendiary and four explosive bombs.United States.It is proposed to employ the U.S. Force based on Gibraltar mainly for escort work Patrols, to the West of Gibraltar.Brazil.A scheme of distribution of Brazilian patrols has been drawn up by the Brazilian Patrols. Ministry of Marine.   Most of the ships named are ineffective until repaired.Squadrons will be based respectively   on  Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and Florianopolis (Santa Catharina).The U.S. patrols are based on Bahia and Rio de Janeiro and H.M. Ships on Rio de Janeiro and the River Plate.Should Brazil definitely join the Allies the Brazilian ships are not likely to be able to Possible co-relieve the Allied patrols of any of their duties but in the event of emergency those that operation, can steam could reinforce our forces.
Argentina.Visit of The visit of H.M.S. &quot; Glasgow&quot; to Buenos Aires was most opportune and did&quot;Glasgow.   mucn to create enthusiasm for the Allies.   An offer was made to the &quot; Glasgow&quot; of the unrestricted use of the Argentine docking and repair facilities.Japan.Programme       Japan&apos;s present Naval Programme aims at a main Fleet in the first instance of of Con-       g Battleships and 4 Battle Cruisers, and eventually of 8 Battleships and 8 Battle stmction.    Cruisers.   Very little progress has actually been made, although the instalment of money for the current year is forthcoming.   The reason is thought to be partly lack of material, and partly indecision as to a suitable type of -capital ship.   The new battleships, of which one only is provided for, are to have 16&quot; guns.Japan has not yet succeeded in making a satisfactory submarine engine.Naval Staff,4th October, 1917.[Appendices.
