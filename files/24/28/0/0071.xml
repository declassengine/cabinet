Colonel Hons(Th&apos;3 Document is t*    Property of? Government)414&apos;REPORT-&apos;re] ating to the War Work of the Beard of Agriculture i-&apos;&quot;for Scotland for the week ending 10th October, 1917.I. Food Production.Agricultural Work.The weather has been of an exceedingly unsettled nature and -heavy rains accompanied by flooding have taken place In many districts.     While the harvest is completed in the more important agricultural districts, a great deal of the grain is still in the fields in the south-western counties and con-eiderable damage by sprouting i8 reported.     Many farmers are carting in grain in a raw or damp state and threshing it off as quickly as possible.     Potato lifting is now in progress in some districts and in counties where the harvest is completed ploughing is also general.1. Labour - Soldiers.Many of the soldiers who were lent for harvest purposes have been returned to their units, but those who are reported by their employers as suitable for agricultural work are being retained with a view to the future working of farms in Scotland. Although very few of the men who were placed at the disposal of farmers had any knowledge or experience of farm work, a considerable number of them became fairly efficient in the end and it ia hoped that they will eventually turn out to be useful farm workers.     It cannot be denied, however, that the dis-appointmont whioh many farmers experienced owing to the in-adequate nature of the labour supplied to them has militated seriously against tho scheme for increased cultivation in1015*. Tho long dragging harvect haB also tended to damp their enthusiasm.2, Compulsory Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulatbm 2M.A Compulsory Order terminating a tenancy at Drumpark, Khbokaiido, Morayshire, under this Regulation was issued by the Board during the week.11.Collection of Returns and Statistics relating to Agriculture.Returns of Stocks of Potatoes.The Board have undertaken, at the request of the Food Controller, to obtain from all persons in Scotland growing five acres or more of potatoes monthly returns showing the quantities of potatoes (classified in five varieties or groups of varieties) in their possession, whether sold or unsold, at the date of the return, and the quantities disposed of during the preceding month.     It Is proposed that the first returns should be made on 1st November.   The Counties of Shetland, Orkney, Caithness and Sutherland, and the greater part of the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll are excluded from the scope of the inquiry.
