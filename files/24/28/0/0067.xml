(This5s Document Ssth^P^P^nfanrilc Majesty^ -over nment;REORGANISATION OF THE BOARD OF TRADEAfter the War much greater demands than heretofore will be made upon the Board of Trade by the commercial and manufacturing interests of the country for guidance and help, and it is essential   that steps should be taken to secure&quot;&apos;greater Governmental vigilance and initiative with -a.view to the maintenance of our commercial.and industrial position.. So far. as relates to Commercial Intelligence, the position will I hope be adequately met by the new organisa-tion which is now being set up jointly by the -Board of Trade and Foreign Office.   But this only covers a comparatively small part of the whole ground.&apos; There-is a widespread demand for a strengthening of the Board of Trade in other directions, and I accordingly invited a small informal Committee, consisting of Sir Clarendon Hyde., Sir A.F. . Firth, Bart., Mr H.J.Mackinder, M.P., and Mr C.T.r;eedham, M.P., to assist me by making inquiry into the organisation of the Board of Trade and by framing proposals for such changes and developments of that organisation as they might think necessary to increase the efficiency of the Board and adapt it for meeting, the growing demands which will be made upon it in the future.The Committee have presented a Report, which is annexed to this Memorandum.   Subject to certain modifica-tions in detail, I am in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s recommendations and as it is in my judgment ofthe
the greatest impbHanee that -the Department should be ready and equipped to meet dt&apos;s.;;new.;respansibilities immediately&apos; on the termination o-f-^the^far and-should be in a position to make&apos;adequate&apos;preparations to- that ;i end, I. pro pose to take&apos; immediate steps to put the scheme int-o operation, at least in its&apos;main-&apos;outlines/ -     - ; .....The following are the principal features of the scheme:-1.    The work of the Board of Trade to be organised &quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; in two main divisions dealing respectively with (a) Commerce&apos;-&apos;. and Industry, and (b)&quot;Pul)lic.-Services, and Control. -The Division of &quot;-Commerce :and Industry will be entirely con-cerned with the development pf tradef with vigilance, with * suggestion,&apos;with iriformation. and wi th.the duty of thinking out and assisting national/commercial and industrial policy. The Public Services and Control-Division will be primarily&apos; engaged in the exercise of statutory and other regulative &quot;&apos; functions now or in the future, entrusted to the Board of Trade.     It&apos;will therefore include: the.present Harbour,&quot;&quot;    * Marine, Railways, Companies end Bankruptcy Departments, and possibly also the Patents -Office.2&quot;&apos; Sach Division will be in charge of a Joint permanent Secretary, but. the Permanent Secretary in charge- of the Commerce, and Industry- Division will rank as&apos;senior.2.    For the purpose of determining questions of policy arising in either Division or affecting both Divisions,-:., . there will be regular meetings of the President, the two Joint Permanent Secretaries and the Parliamentary Secretary,whoxi have not yet finally determined on which side the Patent Office shall be.
who will thus constitute an effective working Board,3.    The Commerce and Industry Division will be concerned with a great number and variety of matters and will according^ ly be divided into a number of sections, or departments,   Each of these sections will be in charge of an officer of-As sis-,-tant Secretary rank (termed &quot;Directors&quot; in the Report), but the organisation will be kept as flexible as possible and. the heads of the various sections will be in constant consultation with each other, and so far as possible will .he. interchange-. able..(   An important feature of the scheme, is that there should be one or more &quot;Directors&quot; in.excess of the. number of sections, so as to provide for.-special investigations and missions, etc.The first Sections to be organised will be for - .. (a) Industrial Development:. A new.department dealingwith home industries, with special reference.to..their development and stability, production, andthe economic strength,of.the country, generally;with questions, of policy.connected with trade. ,   - monopolies and combinations,, slim penetration, ...into British.industries,, and.the promotion of...newtrades.

BCURD Of TRADEReport of a Committee appointed to considerthe question of theREORGANISATION OF THE BOARD 03? TRADE.9th August 1917.
BOARD 0? TRADE RDORMISATIOH.The Right Honourable Sir Albert Stanley, M,P. President of the Board of Trade.*Sir,1.     In accordance with the duty imposed upon us by you, we have undertaken a confidential examination of the Commercial side of the Board of Trade with a view to the framing of propos-als as to measures for strengthening the Government machinery for dealing with trade questions and adapting it to meet the larger demands which will in the future be made upon it in res-pect of the ever-growing needs of British commerce and industry.2.    We have had the advantage of hearing the views of the Permanent Secretary, and of the Second Secretary, the Assistant Seoret&amp;ry in charge of the Commercial Department, and the Comptroller General of the Commercial Intelligence Department, whilst additional information has been furnished to us by Mr, Ashley.     Further, in order that we might have a complete view of the present activities of the Board of Trade and the nature of its work, we have thought it advantageous to consult with the Assistant Secretaries having charge of the Harbour, Marine and Railway Departments, the Comptroller of the Companies Depart-ment, the Comptroller General of Patents, the Inspector General in Bankruptcy, and the Director of the Census of Production,3.     It was apparent at once that the Board of Trade has in the past not considered the promotion or assistance of home trade to be one of its main functions.     Its Commercial side was ohiefly devoted to the assistance of Biitish trade abroad by the collection and dissemination of information, the collect-ion and publication of foreign  trade statistics, the advising
of the Foreign&quot; Office in respect of commercial treaties and other international cigreements, and to dealing with the indiv-idual complaints of traders carrying on &quot;business abroad and their rectification where possible through the medium of the Foreign Office.   But it appears to us obvious that British trade in the future will require many more services from the Board of Trade than it has been accustomed to reoeive in the past.   The demand for a separate Ministry of Commerce and Industry has we think been largely due to the absence from the Board of Trade of any Department which was direotly charged with the safeguarding and development Of home trade, with viligance as to the inroads of foreign manufacturers on British markets, and with watching for gaps in the chain of British manufactures.   There has also been obviously a lack of any home policy with respect to a large number of trade matters, which will be indicated more or less in this report.4.     The Board of Trade will naturally be primarily inter-ested in trade questions from the point of view of the produ-oer, manufacturer and distributor; on the other hand, it should not overlook the interests of the home purchaser and consumer and in this respect should exercise functions alto-gether distinct from those of the various trade associations throughout the country.   Each trade association is necessarily prone to regard tr.:.,de questions from the point of view of its own trade to the exclusion often of all outside considera-tions.   It will be the duty of the Board of Trade to look upon all trade questions as a whole and regard them from the standpoint of national interests.
5.    A great many functions discharged by the Board of Trade at the present time are regulative only.   The Harbour, Marine, Railway, Companies and Bankruptcy Departments and the Patent Offioe are occupied to a predominant extent and in some cases almost exclusively with the discharge of certain statutory duties and the administration of detailed legislative enactments.     They have in some respects consid-erable discretionary powers and we recognise that from time to time questions of policy In which those Departments are largely concerned do arise.   The Heads of those Departments must, with regard to matters coming within their scope, be advisers cf the Board on questions of policy, but whilst we are quite alive to the symmetrical advantage of treating each subject comprehensively by itself, so that policy and administration may go hand in hand, we believe that to leave questions of policy entirely or even mainly to these Depart-ments would lead to a certain amount of suspicion on the part of traders that control was aimed at, and would largely restrict the authority and influence of the Board.6.    For whilst the functions of -ehe Board on its com-mercial side will be to act as a friendly adviser of British trade and to take an active interest in everything that promotes or develops the commerce of the United.Kingdom, we feel bound to enter a warning against any attempt to estab-lish a bureaucratic control of the operations of British traders and manufacturers,,   Any such attempt must in our judgment not only be doomed to failure but exercise a detrimental effect on British trade.
For this reason we think it is essential that the oommer-cial side of the Board of Trade, which will he concerned with the promotion and development of British commerce and industry, should be kept as separate and distinct as possible from the regulative and administrative Departments, that is, those which are principally concerned, as we have said, with the discharge of statutory duties.   In saying this, however, we wish to make it quite clear that the work done by those Departments In the past appears to us to have been valuable and necessary, and it does not seem that any suoh work should be discontinued in the future.   On the con-trary the Departments in question should, where they require it, be strengthened, and in particular we think that the Heads of those Departments, though responsible for the admin-istrative work, should have the services of such numbers of principal clerks as may be necessary to prevent actual minis-terial work devolving unduly upon them, so that they may be in a position to devote all the time that may be necessary to advising the commercial side of the Board on all questions of policy, where their practical experience should prove of the greatest value.7.    For the purpose of seouring the division of functions whioh we advocate whilst at the same time securing joint con-sideration of all the questions affecting both sides of the work of the Board, and maintaining unity of direction, we have come to the conclusion that the Board should be divided into two main divisions:-(l) A division of Commerce and Industry, which would be entirely concerned with the development of trade, with vigil-anoe, with suggestion, with information, and with the duty Of thinking out, unifying and assisting national commercial and Industrial policy; and
(2)   A division of Public Services and Control, which would be primarily engaged in the exercise of statutory regulative functions now or in future entrusted to the Board of Trade. In this division we should include the present Harbour Depart-ment, possibly with some change of name (such as the &quot;Public Utilities Department&quot;) which would better Indicate its scope, the Marine Department, the Railway Department, the Companies Department, the Bankruptcy Department and the Patent Office.8.    As regards the Patent Office, the Comptroller General of Patents is entrusted by statute with considerable powers of a judicial nature, and is also the expert adviser of the Board of Trade on questions Of Industrial Property.   But whilst the Comptroller General himself thus occupies a special position by far the greater part of tho work of the Patent Office is of an administrative character, and we are of opinion that the Offioe should be placed in the Public Services and Control Bivision, though the Comptroller General would remain the principal expert adviser of the Board and be constantly con-suited on questions of policy.9.    From a logical point of view, it seems inconsistent that the safety of railwaymen, sailors, and passengers should be entrusted to the Board of Trade, whilst the safety of miners and operatives is in charge of the Home Offioe.   We recognise, however, that logio does not enter into the consid-eration, and that both Ministries can be indifferently charged by Parliament with like, if non-competitive functions.   The advisability of regrouping the analogous work of the Board and other Ministries forms no part of our reference.10.    For the purpose of carrying out the duties of the Board as thus divided, it appears to us to be eminently desirable that the present office of Permanebr Secretary should be converted into two Joint Permanent Secretaries,
0 Q 9o Lone for each Division, the intention being that whilst eaoh Joint Secretary should be primarily concerned with the work of his own Division with definitely delegated authority and responsibility in respect of it, he would nevertheless be acquainted with and equally responsible for the work of the other Division, for it is essential that however much the various Departments are nominally separated, they should in the minds of the Secretaries, be considered as parts of a complete organised whole. Each Secretary will, of course, have free access to the President, but we think that the Permanent Secretary in charge of the Commerce and Industry Division should rank by courtesy as the senior official.11.     We have considered the advisability of inter-polating a Permanent Vice President of the Board of Trade whose functions would be to exercise a general supervision and see that the decisions of the President were carried out, but who should not be responsible for the actual conduct of either Division.   There seems, however, no real opening for suoh an official, and it is possible that he would find himself without sufficient occupation except during the inter-regnum caused by change of President or during the absence of the President for any reason. There is the further disadvantage that a Yioe*President of strong personality, with insufficient work, would tend too often to become, as a Senior Official, one to whom the Permanent Secretaries would refer matters for decision and who would be regarded by them as a responsible chief. The result would be that the present system by which much of the weight of the Board of Trade is concentrated on one man would be reestablished.   The objective to be had
in view is to increase the number of responsible officials answerable directly to the President.   The inter-position of a Vice-President or of a third Permanent Secretary without definitely assigned duties acting as the Presi-dentTs right hand man, would we believe weaken the res-ponsibility of the two Permanent Secretaries and tend to give rise to jealousy and friction.   We therefore cannot recommend either of these appointments, though their con-venience from some points of view is obvious.12.    Questions of policy may originate either within or without the Divisions.   But such questions should usually be examined by the Divisions or Departments con-oerned and should then come up for discussion at a meeting of the President, the two Permanent Secretaries, and the Parliamentary Secretary, who w)uld call into consultation the heads of the various Departments both advisory and administrative and any other persons whose Opinion they may think likely to be of use.   This would seem to pro-vide the best means of arriving at a correct and well-informed solution, the final decision of course remaining with the President himself.In the absence of the President we think the Parliamentary Secretary should preside both at these meetings and also at the meetings of the Advisory Council referred to later in this Report.   If it were possible for the President to have some voice in the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary, we should regard it ae a distinct advantage,13,    We do not think it necessary to make any fur-ther suggestions as to the Departments whose main concern is the exercise of the regulative powers and duties of the Board, and we proceed to discuss the organisation of the Division of Commerce and Industry.   That Divison will
be concerned with a very great.ntunher.and variety of matters, and, whilst we recognise that it will be neo-essary for the carrying on of its work for those subjects to be divided into various sections, we regard it as of great importance that the organisation of the Division should be as flexible as possible and that every effort should be made to secure that any such grouping as may from time to time be adopted shall not become stereotyped. For this purpose what we should \?ish to see is the appoint-ment of a number of officials to be called Directors of a standing corresponding to that of the Assistant Secret-aries in charge of the Departments on the Public Servioes and Control side, to whom groups of matters would be ref-erred by the head of the Divison from time to time, but who would not regard themselves or be regarded as assigned permanently to the charge of those groups, and should be readily interchangeable.   The number should not be fixed but should be capable of temporary or permanent increase according to the changing needs of the Department. Provision should be made for filling a proportion of these posts from outside the Civil Service.14.    It is in our opinion very desirable that the officials whom we have styled Directors should be enabled to make frequent visits to the chief centres of commerce and industry and to attend meetings of representative Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associations and should also go abroad from time to time on special missions.   This would widen their knowledge and experience and also give them that personal acquaintance with manufacturers and merchants Which we think is essential if the Department is to command the general confidence of the trading communi-ty.   In order to allow of Directors being seconded for
for foreign visits, and for the purpose of the investiga-tion of special economic problems from time to time, it would in our opinion be advisable to appoint a small number of Directors in excess of the number actually required by the grouping of the matters dealt with in the Commerce and Industry Division, these &quot;free&quot; Direct^ ors being utilised both for special work and for taking the places of any of their colleagues detached for special duty. -15.    As there will be a number of these Directors, it would probably be advisable that, say, two of them should rank as senior and aot as assistants to the Joint Permanent Secretary in charge of the Divison, but just as we think that there should be no stereotyping of the matters entrusted to the various Directors so we are of opinion that there should be no stereotyped division of work between the two assistants to the Joint Permanent Secretary, and that the functions discharged by each should be variable and in fact be varied from time to time.   It will be necessary in order to enlist and retain the confidence of the Trader that certain Directors should be assigned for limited fixed peri-ods to each section within the Division - so that the Trader may know and have confidence in the Director whom he comes to consult.   The relative co-Director assigned as understudy to one or more particular groups of subjects should take every opportunity to form the acquaintance of the Trader when he calls on business, so that the transfer of the Director to other work or his absenoe on the business of his section would permit his oo-Direetor to take on his work either as successor or in charge without disturbing outside relations.
0 Q C 6 016*    Subject to these main principles we proceed to outline the work which we think might be taken by the Commerce and Industry Division, indicating the Sections into whioh it might in the first instance be organised.   These Sections would naturally be added to or varied from time to time.fl) Industrial Development and Business Organisation.     To this; Section would be allotted in the first instance all subjects which do not naturally fall into one or other of the Sections named   below.   It would from time to time divest itself of any growing subject by constituting a fresh Section.   The subjects with which it should deal at the outset would in-clude all enquiries into the state of the industries of the country, with special reference to their development and stability, production, imports and exports, and the economic strength of the country generally.   Amongst the matters to be dealt with will be questions of policy connected with trade monopolies and combinations, their organisation, con-duct and management; State action as to alien penetration into British Industries; investigation into the state of key industries and other industries essential to the National safety and for the security of trade; questions of policy as to the promotion of new trades; questions in connection with such matters as the conservation of the mineral resources of the country, cotton growing within the Snpire and the supplies of other raw materials for which this country is dependent on imports - rubber, timber, wool, jute, tin and other metals; the improvement of the classification of imports and exports both in this country and the Dominions; questions of policy (domestio and international) relating to Industrial property
(Patents, Trade Marks, Designs, Copyright and Merchandise Marks), including the harmonising of the Empire Laws in relation to such matters.The work of this group would he of very great impor-tance and would need a larger number of Directors than any other Section,(2) Overseas Commerce,   This would include ths work of the present Commercial Department; such matters as Commercial Treaties and Agreements; Foreign and Dominion tariffs and trade regulations, and all other matters affecting British commercial industrial and shipping interests abroad, in res-pect of which the Board will play an inoreasingly important part as Adviser of the Foreign, India and Colonial Offices. Included in its work should be the watching and reporting upon, the effect of dumping and of any anti-dumping legis-lation,(3) Commercial and Industrial Information. This would includethe work of the present Department of Commercial Intelligence, namely the collection and distribution of trade information both at home and abroad, the supervision of the work of Trade Commissioners and correspondence with Consuls and other offioial commercial representatives in foreign coun-tries.   We desire to emphasise the importance which we attaoh to this Section.   The work which has hitherto been carried on must in future be considerably extended.   The Exhibitions Branch promises to be an increasing factor in the development of British trade.   The &quot;Board of Trade Journal&quot;, which we consider of increasing utility, should be kept thoroughly up to date, especially with regard to all matters relating to the development of new trades and new branches of trade within the United Kingdom.
We think that the Section should take into consider-ation the advisability of establishing branch offices for information purposes in the chief centres of industry where information of local importance should be specially regis-tered, as well as at the Central Office.   We are of opinion that the Central Office will afford the best assistance to trade generally if it continues to be located in the City of London.(4) Transport Light and Power. This would include the considera-tion of all questions of general policy relating to trans-port, including shipping, canal and railway rates, shipping conferences and other transport combinations; the question of the conservation of fuel; and all questions of general policy regarding the generation and distribution of electri-city, gas and water power, including the restriction of in-dustrial and trade developments, owing to the existence of rights of way (e.g. unreasonable prevention of wayleaves for coal or for transmission lines for electricity, and the im-peding of the construction of docks and harbours by public rights of way).     To this Section would also be assigned the growing questions connected with Aerial Transport.17.     Provision should also be made for the Commercial and Industrial Division of the Board being in constant and close communication with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and any other official bodies such as the Imperial Institute and the National physical Laboratory, and unofficial bodies such as the Engineering Standards Com-mittee, whose work has any bearing on the matters with which the Division would be oonoerned.
j18,     To the Commercial^and Industrial Division of tho Board of Trade there should be attached a strong unpaid Advisory Council thoroughly representative of the commercial and trading interests of the country.    We suggest that the trade oommittees now in existence X with any alterations in personnel that may be expedient to make them really repres-entative should be maintain^ as Standing Advisory Sub-Committees until after the period of reconstruction and the question of their reconstitution should then be considered,3?he Chairman for the time being of these sub-committees should be ex officio members of the Advisory Council, whioh should also include representatives of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and other leading Trade Associations, such other Government Departments as the For-eign Office, the India Office and the Colonial Office, and also of.the Dominion Governments,     The representation on the Council should be based rather on industries than on geographical areas and for this purpose in addition to the representation given through the Association of Chambers of Commerce some of the more important and comprehensive trade associations might be invited to nominate representatives. Provision should also be made for the representation of financial interests, and whatever rights on nomination be accorded to associations, we think the President should reserve to himself a certain number of appointments.Viz. for 1, Financial Facilities.2. Coal.3. Iron and Steel.4, Engineering.5. Electrical Trade.6. Textile Trades.7. Non-Ferrous Metal Trades.8. Shipping and Shipbuilding
19,     The fact that a sub-committee exists for any parti-cular branch of industry and that its chairman is ex offioio a member of the Advisory Council should not exclude the ap-pointment of other representatives of that industry.   As a first list of trades which might be represented we suggest for consideration the Shipping Industry; the Coal Trade; the Heavy Iron and Steel Industries; the Sheffield and Birmingham Districts Metal Trades; the Electrical Trades; Shipbuilding; the Leather Trades; the China and Glass-Ware Trades; the Paper Trade; and possibly the Pood Export Trades.   In the cases of the Textile Trades (Cotton, Wool, Silk, Linen, Jute) and the Chemical Industries provision would necessarily have to be made for the representation of the various branches.We think that some provision should be made for the representation of the merchant class.20.    The Advisory Council should meet at least monthly and have a General Purposes Committee constituted by rota meeting weekly.   It should be arranged that one-third of the members of the Advisory Council retire each year (the first retirement being at the end of the second year) and are not eligible for re-election until at least one year has elapsed. Any vacancy should be filled so far as possible by the appoint-ment of a new representative of the same particular interest.21.    The Trade Advisory Sub-Committees, as to which there should be some similar provision for systematic changes of membership would be called together from time to time as occasion arises and any Officials in the Commerce and Industry Division who might be concerned with the business of the Com-mittees would attend as a matter of course.22, Statistical Department. This Department should con-solidate the Census of Production and the Statistical sections of the present Commercial Department; it would have charge of
the Census of Production whether quinquennial or at more frequent intervals, and should also have charge of the collection, compilation and publication of all statistics relating to railways, shipping, cotton and other raw mater-ials and foreign commerce, and of the preparation of the various annual publications of the Board, so far as theso do not relate to the regulative work of any Department on the Public Services and Control side.   It is, however, most desirable that the head of the Statistical Department should also exercise consultative functions with respect to these purely Departmental statistical publications, but by far the greater part of his work will be related to that of the Commerce and Industry Division,   We believe that more valua-ble results would be obtained from the formation of such a statistical Department as we propose under the direction of&quot; highly trained statisticians (and for this purpose the head of the Department should have at least two highly trained assistants well paid) than are likely to be obtained by the maintenance of a number of small statistical divisions under competent  hut not highly skilled clerks.   The heads of this Department would necessarily have to be in constant consul ta-tion with their colleagues \iho would have to make use for their own special purposes of the statistics prepared by the Statistical Department, so that the salient facts may emerge and not only correctly tabulated dead figures,23,    There remain three Departments to which we have not yet referred, namoly, the Legal, Finance, and Establish-ment Departments.   The first of these was we understand prior to the War engaged chiefly with work connected with the regulative Departments and presumably its work would be mainly of that character in the future, though as hitherto
the services of the Solicitor will he at the disposal of any part of the Board which may require them.   The Finance and Establishment Departments will continue to serve the Board as a whole.84.   An organisation suoh as that we have indicated is outlined in the appended diagram and seems to us likely to provide that flexibility and power of expansion which we think essential and to place the Board of Trade in a position which would enable it to command the general confidence of the commercial and trading community and in which it would be competent to meet the growing demands of the country for Government information, assistance and guidance.     We think it of great importance that the first steps in the creation of such an organisation should be taken at the earliest pcssi-ble moment so that the Board may be equipped to play its pro-per part during the difficult period of commercial and Indus-trial reconstruction after the War.25.   We desire to draw special attention to the fact that the Ministry of Munitions has acquired a vast amount of information both as to the trade of the country.t the possibility of regulating supplies eo as to economise waste; the sources of supply of present and future raw materials; costs of production (so far as the same aienot eeoret or individual); and the openings for future trade.   All this mass of information and statistics, together with the in-formation to be obtained from the War Trade Intelligence Department, the Censorrs Department of the War Office and other War Departments, will be of great assistance to trade after the War if intelligently handled.   The Board of Trade should be ready and equipped to take over and deal with these matters and should arrange in due time for the trans-fer to the Board of the services of Buch suitable members of
the staff of the Ministry and the other Departments above referred to as may be available *26.    We attach much importance to the creation of a class of Foreign Trade Commissioners not resident abroad but visiting foreign countries periodically, to obtain a nearer sitrvey of the trade of those countries, to stimulate the work of cur Consuls, and to report on possible openings for British trade and on hindrances and drawbacks from which it suffers.Whilst we recognise that the Consular Service must -remain under the control of the Foreign Office, we consider that closer and direct relations between the Consuls and the Board of Trade should be established and encouraged.27,    The manufacturers and traders of this coun-try wish to have a Government Department to which they can refer in all questions of difficulty which they cannot by themselves solve.   Many of these problems will have to be solved ultimately by statute, but until the Commerce and Industry Division of the Board of Trade Is satisfied as to the advisability of adopting any particular line in the national interest, the President would no doubt hesitate to proceed to obtain statutory powers.   On the other hand it should be the duty of the Commerce and Industry Division thoroughly to in-vestigate all those questions on the demand of Associa-tions or traders, the chief object being to remove from their path everything which obstructs the free course of production, manufacture and salem and to see that British traders are not hampered either here or abroad in any unreasonable way, or in any matter in Which by careful intervention en the part of the Board of Trade
a satisfactory solution can be arrived at,28.    In conclusion we draw your attention to the fact that for the successful carrying out of the work of the Commerce and Industry Division, in addition to inviting more frequently than hitherto the assistance of experienced memberB of the public, great reliance will have to be placed upon the efficiency of the senior offiaials.     It will, we imagine, be frequently a case of obtaining men frpm outside, as distinct from ordinary promotion within the ranks of the service.  High qualifications and experience are essential if the Board of Trade is to command the confidence of manu-faoturers and traders of the country, and to discharge ade-quately the duties which we have in view.   We doubt very much whether it will be possible for the Board to obtain or retain the services of such officials as will be needed at the inadequate rates of pay now attributed to the senior officials*Whilst wo recognise the social status of the Service and the pension advantages attaching thereto, these considera-tions are not, in our judgment, sufficient for the purpose. We venture to direct your earnest attention to this point. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servants, (signed) CLARENDON S. HYDE. (Chairman), A,F, FIRTH. H.J.
