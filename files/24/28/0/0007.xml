This action is desirable in some cases.in the interest of the securing of the distribution of fish supplies at inland towns.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries *
Fish Food Section.A Register is &quot;being compiled of all the motor fishing &quot;boats on the ;.ist, with particulars of their engines, with a view to making   rovision for supplies of fuel.     Fuel must &quot;be supplied sparingly owing to shortage, and it is proposed to limit the supply allowed to each &quot;boat-Shoals of mackerel having &quot;been seen off Sidmouth an officer has gone to Bridport to make arrangements for dealing with the fish.Another officer has gone to Yarmouth to deal with any difficulties that may arise there.     The Scarborough fish trade have expressed their thanks for the help which has &quot;been given &quot;by the Board in dealing with difficulties of transport etc.An ample supply of wood-turnings has &quot;been procured for the Smokers at Yarmouth and Lowestoft;   without the help of the Section there must have &quot;been a grave shortage of this essential commodity.The questions of tinplate, wood for boxes, mussels, etcT receive daily attention.Motor Loan Seotion.Three more installations have been completed on the East Coast, South Coast and Thames Estuary.Highly satisfactory reports have been received of the work of motor-boats on the East Coast in the neighbourhood of Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth.     The herring season is beginning and the small motor boats have been making good catches.     On one day at Yarmouth they landed 180 crans.     The two. most successful boats at Yarmouth -are equipped with motors under the loan scheme, and so is the &quot;top-boat&quot; from Kessingland Beach.Complaints of the high price of paraffin continue to come in from all ports where there is at this time no specially profitable fishing.     At Yarmouth and Lowestoft control of the supply is being taken in hand, with a view to preventing any shortage;   but regulation of price can be accomplished only by contracts on a large scale.     This will, if possible, be undertaken.Freshwater Fish.The arrangements for the establishment of an experimental eel fishery at Beaulieu are nearing completion.Questions affecting the pollution of the Ouse and Nene and the Canterbury Stour have been dealt with and the officer commanding Sutton Veney Camp has agreed to remedy the pollution caused by sewage from the Camp.Ordnance Survey.94,443 maps were sent to France during the week and 2,748 to the Admiralty.12 relief models were sent to France.
Potato, disease.The season for lifting potatoes being now well advanced the number of new cases of Wart Disease reported during the week has fallen considerably.     Taking stock of the results of this season in preparation for next year&apos;s campaign, it is quite evident that the potato planting propaganda of last Spring has indirectly caused an enormous increase in the amount of disease present in the country.     Not only have a large number of old allotments, previously abandoned on account of disease, been replanted whereby the disease has been renewed, but much new land has been infected for the first time.     It is estimated that the number of infected allotments and gardens, treating each as a separate case, are little short of 100,000, a total obviously too large to cope with by means of direct inspection and the issue of notices as has been the practice in past years.     Even the system adopted in 1914 of treating groups of allotments as units for certain purposes is out of the question.Hew measures are therefore needed, of which the most important is the adequate supply of seed potatoes of the immune varieties.     It is useless to insist on the planting of immune varieties unless the Board are in a position to ensure supplies. Arrangements have accordingly been made with the Pood Production Department for the purchase of 10,000 tons of potatoes of immune varieties, and steps are now being taken to ascertain from dealers, co-operative societies and local supply committees what quantities will be required in each district.     At the same time the machinery for distribution and licensing is being simplified and accelerated, and some new Orders are under consideration with this end in view. To maet one set of conditions the co-operation of the Local Authority is being sought; under other conditions it is proposed to prohibit the planting or sale of potatoes of susceptible varieties altogether over a very large area.     It will be necessary to apply three or four grades of restrictions on planting potatoes on Wart Disease infected land, according to the degree of prevalence and intensity of the disease in different places^In other Branches the business has proceeded on normal lines as indicated in previous reports.Secretary.5th Ocvcber, 1917.65,625 Redistribution maps have been sent to London for the lie port of the Commission on Electoral Reform.In last week&apos;s report the number of Redistribution maps sent should have read 351,625 instead of 38,000.
