Colonel Jones(iimTS TOCDMBIIT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS JHM1IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.s icrbfWAR   CABINET.G.T.2252.SUGGESTED CESS 101 OP VIRGIN ISLANDS TO THE UNITED STATES OP AMERICA AND QUID PRO QUO FOR THE SAME.The following Note, prepared by Captain Amery, is circulated for the information of the War Cabinet.tint a J   M.P..A.E.2 Whitehall Gardens, 11th October 1917.S.A paper (G.T.2168) Under the above title, prepared in the Admiralty, has been circulated for the information of the Wax Cabinet&apos; In considering tbe question of possible territorial concessions fromthe United States in&quot;exchange for the Virgin Islands, the Admiralty paper deals with a suggestion put forward by Sir Alexander Swattenham that euTbh concessions might be secured in the neighbourhood cf the Straits of Juan da Puca, ho, on the southern boundary between British Columbia and the United States, end rejects this suggestion as certain to bo wholly unacceptable to the United States.   The paper does not, however, discuss the possibility of a rectification of frontier at&apos; the other.end of the Canadian Pacific sea-board, viz. in respect of the Alaska coast strip of &quot;Pan-handle&quot;.   This strip of territory, the subject matter of the Alaskan Boundary Arbitration, is of the greatest importance to Canada owing to the fact that itrestricts the natural access by sea to a great part of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory.    On the other hand it is of relatively little value, whether from the practical or from the sentimental point of view/ to the United States.   The great desirability of securing this strip for Canada, which, unlike the other Dominions, has otherwise no direct territorial claims in respect of the settlement at the end of the war, was brought before Lord Curzonls Committee of the Imperial War Cabinet by the Canadian Government.   The difficulty of finding any equivalent which would be of real value to the United States, an5 which we could give up consistently with our- own strategic interests in the VTest Indies and our obligations to the populations concerned, was on that occasion pointed out by the Secretary&apos;of State for the Colonies, and the matter was not pressed, though&apos;it was understood that it would be further enquired into.     The possibility of securing, if not the whole, then at any rate some portion of the Alaska coast strip should therefore be kept in view in connection with this question of the Virgin Islands,- or of any other concession, o-.gh liberation from the terms of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, which the United States may put forward in connection with the general settlement at the end of the war.(Signed)1.5-. AM3BY.3rd October, 1917.
