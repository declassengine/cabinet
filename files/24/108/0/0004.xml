(Visited 22nd April-2nd May.)Political.1. The British are not popular in Constantinople. Our French and Italian Allies regard us with coldness, whilst the Russians, of whom there are a considerable number of refugees, do not show the gratitude which our help would seem to have deserved. The Turks appear to look upon us as their principal enemy, and as the main cause of the severity of the terms of the Peace Treaty; at the same time, they evidently hold Great Britain and our authorities in Constantinople in high respect, owing to the part we played in the war, to our strong action in occupying Constantinople so promptly and efficiently, and to the number of Imperial troops now on the spot.Both in Constantinople and Smyrna the friendliness of the Greeks was extremely noticeable : they regard us as the saviours of their country * and recognize our help in assisting them to their new territorial acquisitions.2. Strong Nationalist Turkish opposition to the Peace Treaty may be expected, especially with regard to the cession of Thrace and the Smyrna area to Greece. In the latter case, the Turks believe the Italians and, to some extent, also the French, to be on their side.The present anti-Nationalist Turkish Government has, of course, no power outside Constantinople and the small area controlled by Allied troops ; beyond this region its decrees carry no weight whatever.3. Large portions of the city of Constantinople, in Stamboul as in Pera, have been burnt out and are in ruins. In consequence of this, and owing to the numbers of refugees now in Constantinople, the town is very much overcrowded.There is danger of a serious food shortage later on in the summer, the normal sources of supply from Anatolia and the Black Sea ports having been cut off. Prices are already high and are likely to rise still further.4. General Milne spoke to me of the necessity of having a diplomatic representative in the Crimea with General Wrangel to assist in carrying out negotiations with the Soviet Government. It is highly undesirable to use British officers of the Mission for this purpose, and the High Commissioner s charter for Constantinople does not extend beyond that city.Military.*1. The British and Indian troops of the Army of the Black Sea are adequate for the task of defending Constantinople, and of ensuring a free passage through the Dardanelles, against any Nationalist forces that can be brought against them in the* This was written at the end of April, when General Milue had no reason to suppose that the Turkish Government troops, which were at the time operating- successfully against the Nationalists, would fail him. After the terms of the Peace Treaty became known, the Turkish Government troops collapsed and offered little or no resistance to the advauce of the Nationalists. (B20/292)   100   6/20  H&amp;S   8329woMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, some notes by the     221 Director of Military Intelligence on his recent visit to Turkey, Palestine, Egypt,    Medn. Jugo-Slavia, Bulgaria, Italy and France. 5575w. s. c.The War Office,21st June, 1920.
near future. In such an eventuality, it is hoped our forces would receive some measure of support from the French and Italian troops, which at present do not obey the orders of General Milne.2. On the other hand, our present strength is inadequate for offensive operations of any importance, or for holding Batum against any determined attempt by the Bolsheviks to take the place.3. The appearance, of the British troops is good, though they are young. The morale of the Indian battalions is satisfactory and they may, at all events for the greater part, be relied on to fight well in case of necessity; some attempts are being made to undermine their loyalty, but with little or no success up to the present.4. General Milne&apos;s position is one of some difficulty and considerable delicacy, especially in regard to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey and the French. It is advisable that General Franchet d&apos;Ksperey should not return to Constantinople.Until final ratification takes.place, it is essential that General Milne should remain in command at Constantinople, and that he should be the sole military adviser to the Civil High Commissioners. At present the French and Italian commanders interfere constantly by influencing their own High Commissioners. After ratification, chief command should be held in turn by Allied generals, beginning with a British officer.5. The general impression made by the Greek troops in the Smyrna area was fairly good ; the men seemed fit and contented and looked ready to fight if required. It is always difficult to gauge the fighting value of troops belonging to a Southern race, as they are liable to considerable fluctuations, but the appearance of these Greeks certainly warranted the belief that they would give a axwd account of themselves.If not closely watched, they are liable to attempt encroachments beyond the sphere allotted to them in the Smyrna Sanjak without authority.For example, a few days before I visited the Greek front at Cherkess-keui on the 2nd May, General Joannou, Commanding Greek 2nd Corps at Manisa, had massed troops for an advance east of the Panderma Ak Hissar railway, a line the Greeks have always wanted within their area. Brigadier-General Hanbury, the head of our military mission, discovered this and reported it to the Greek General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, General Paraskevopoulos, who at once stopped the movement. My visit, which was quite accidental, was regarded as an investigatory one into the affair,6. The intelligence section of the Army of the Black Sea is of great importance, and I am by no means satisfied with its conduct at the present time. Much hard work is being done, but the organization is not good, and little attention is being paid to field intelligence, with regard to which the troops are not so well informed as they might be.In my opinion, this section, which controls some 100 officers, engaged in most varied work and spread over a large area, should be under a General Staff Officer, 1st Grade, a man of greater&apos;experience than the officer now in charge, especially with regard to &quot; fighting intelligence,&quot; as opposed to secret and political intelligence.In the meanwhile, after consultation with General Milne, who asked me to send him out a fully-trained intelligence officer, I have offered him Major P. C. Hey wood, Royal Garrison Artillery, who should carry out the duty to his satisfaction.7. General Milne spoke to me of the necessity, in his opinion, for having an Inspector of Artillery to ensure uniformity of training and to get rid of inefficient officers.Notes on Palestine and Syeia.   (Visited 4th-l 1th May.)Political.1. The political situation in Palestine and Syria is at the present time unsettled and dangerous, owing to a variety of causes, amongst which the principal are : (a.) The delay in making peace with Turkey. This leads to all sorts of political aspirations and propaganda, aided by the &quot; self-determination of small nations &quot; and similar doctrines.It is still of importance to conclude and ratify peace with Turkey with the least possible delay, though it is now too late for us to hope lor the terms of peace to be accepted by the Turkish Nationalists. The inaugura-tion of a Nationalist Government in Constantinople with Mustapha Kemal in the Cabinet might offer some chance of getting the Peace Treaty carried out, if signed.(.6.) The loss of confidence in, and respect for, the Allies, mainly owing to unfulfilled promises, and to the dissensions between Great Britain and France over Eastern questions.
(c.) The apparently wilful disregard by the Allies of the wishes of the people of Syria and Palestine, by foisting the French on the former and the Jewish National Home on the latter.It must not be forgotten i hat the Jews are a hated and despised race, both by the Moslems and Christians, in this part of the world, and that the policy of making Palestine a State to be eventually ruled by the Jews, cannot fail to arouse the fanaticism and racial pride of the Arabs.(d.) The high cost of living and uncertainty of the future.2. Palestine and Syria are full of intrigues. There can be little doubt-that the French are intriguing against us their agents are all over Palestine but they regard this as only a just return for intrigues of which they consider our officers in Syria to have been guilty last autumn, before the country was handed over to the French.3. Syria and Cilicia are in a dangerous staTO of disorder and anarchy. The French, are extremely unpopular and a strong attempt will be made to shake off their yoke. On the other hand, the Arab Government at Damascus is by n) means strong and it is-po-sible that the Arabs will eventually agree to some form of advisory control by the French. ,Reinforcements are now being despatched by France to Syria, and it remains to be seen what action the Arabs will take after their arrival.From all accounts the French officials in Syria are disheartened by the state of&quot; affairs, and do not consider it worth while to remain in a country the people of which desire to be independent and are ready to fight for their freedom.4. With regard, to Palestine, our policy is one fraught with extreme danger unless dealt with very carefully. As long as, in making a &quot;National Home for the Jews,&quot; the rights of the present inhabitants are completely respected, the policy is not open to serious criticism and need not lead to grave trouble. ,The danger is that undue favouritism should be shown to Jews and that they should be given unwarranted ascendancy over the other inhabitants, i.e., the Moslems, and Christians, who outnumber the Jews in a proportion of about ten to one.Such conduct would be rightly regarded by the Arabs as a complete breach of faith, and might lead not only to serious local trouble, but to Mohammedan unrest, and even rebellion, throughout our Eastern Empire.All this was stated to me quite openly by the Grand Mufti, who went so far as to talk about a Jehad. He told me that he likened the country to a dried up garden, sprinkled with inflammatory material ready to burst in to flame owing to the want of irrigation by British justice.He also informed me that the German Jew, Roupin (a member of the Zionist Commission in Jerusalem), had suggested to him an Arab-Jew combination against the British, whose power was now impotent as regards Zionist aspirations.5. The Zionists in Palestine are not pro-British, and there is no reason to suppose that a Zionist Palestine would ever be really friendly with Great Britain; at all events, the friendship would only last as long as the Zionist State were dependent on Great Britain for military protection.6. The existence of the Zionist Commission in its present form is a standing insult to the British Administration. The Zionist Commission is organized in 13 Departments, exactlv corresponding to those of General Bols&apos; administration.Not only are these Jewish Departments inclined to interfere with the work of our officials, but their very constitution affords ample testimony that the Zionists are already preparing to take over the government of the country.All thinking Arabs appear to hold this view, and it has shaken their faith most seriously in the impartiality of our present policy and of its future attitude.British officials of our administration in Palestine, and British officers of the troops of occupation are unanimous in expressing their dislike of any policy favouring the Jews, and serious fears of the consequences of such a policy.They are convinced that the Arab population of Palestine will not submit willingly to Jewish domination. They are equally convinced that the real intention of the Zionists is to flood the country with Jewish immigrants, mostly from the lowest classes in Russia, Poland and Roumania, with the avowed intention of creating an alien majority, thereby seizing political power, and crushing and dispossessing the Arabs of their lands and eventually getting rid of the mandatory Power-Great Britain.Moslems and Christians in Palestine consider that Jewish rule will be a fierce and bigoted tyianny, and are consequently unwilling to submit to such a rule except under compulsionC8329) A 2
7. It seems, therefore, of the utmost importance at the present time to check any-advance in the Zionist policy and to abide strictly by our declared policy of helping to create a &quot;National Home for the Jews,&quot; but at the same time safeguarding and protecting the rights and independence of the present inhabitants of the country.Although the Arabs of Palestine are not sufficiently organized, rich and warlike to start a revolution or oppose a Zionist policy (backed by British bayonets), by force to any serious extent, there may be isolated outbreaks, and in any case the situation will give fuel for agitation throughout the Mohammedan world.We have everything to gain by supporting the just rights of our Moslem, subjects, and of the Moslem inhabitants of Palestine, and a great deal to lose by failure to do so in the interests of what is commonly &quot;considered as mistaken idealism.Military.1. If a pro-Zionist policy is adopted, beyond that indicated by the, official pronouncements, the cost of maintenance of troops in Palestine will be high. Owing to resistance by the local Arabs and attacks from outside, it will be impossible to reduce the strength of the British garrison, and it may be found necessary to increase it. In fact Lieut.-General Sir W. N, Congreve and Major-General Sir John Shea both stated that, to keep order with the situation as it is at the moment, the existing troops were sufficient, but if extensive operations were necessitated by a general rising, another division would be required.- 2. There is a general unwillingness among the British troops to support a pro-Zionist policy. They are not exactly prorArab, but prefer the Arabs very greatly to the Jews. There is a general feeling against the sacrifice of the lives of British and Indian soldiers in support of a policy of oppression of the local inhabitants in favour of the Jewish minority.3. The Jewish battalion at present serving in &quot;Palestine should be disbanded with the least possible delay. It is considerably under strength, ill-disciplined, and its members are constantly indulging in illegal acts, its military value is extremely small and does not by any means justify the expense of upkeep. Its existence is a constant provocation to the Moslem and Christian inhabitants, and its composition renders it impossible to use it for the maintenance of order, on religious grounds.4. The following are some of the difficulties with which the General Officer Commanding our Forces in Palestine, has to contend(a.) Too rapid demobilization, depriving him of practically all his experts, e.g., signallers, mechanical transport drivers, &amp;c.(b.) Excessive parsimony on the part of the War Office, and failure to accept recommendations for the provision of things that are urgently required. An instance of this is the provision of water for the troops encamped near Ludd.(c.) A number of units are considerably under establishment. In view of the likelihood of trouble in Palestine, as well as attacks by Trans-Jordan Bedouins, as have already taken place, it is most necessary that all British and Indian units should be kept up to full strength.(d.) Clothing should be on the peace scale. At present only one&apos; khaki coat per man is allowed and one hair brush among eight.(e.) Road communications in Palestine are extremely bad. In view of the likelihood of military operations, these should be improved without delay, and sufficient money granted for the purpose.(/.) The number of aeroplanes requires doubling from 12 to 24. It is necessary to be able to rely on getting 12 planes into the air at any one time. At present it is sometimes difficult to get even two. Road communications being as bad as they are, brigade commanders can only get to their advanced posts by aeroplane, and these are often not available when most required, e.g., the recent Bedouin attacks on Samakh and Beisan (22nd-24th April) when an aeroplane would have been invaluable to the 10th Cavalry Brigade Commander at Jenin.
Notes on , Egypt.   (Visited 12th-18th May.)Political. m1. Whilst in Egypt I had two interviews with the Sultan and several long conversations with Lord Allenby, General Congreve, and a number of British civilian and military officials in Cairo.Sirri Pasha, Egyptian ex-Minister of War and of Public Works^ travelled from Alexandria to Malta with me and discussed a number of Egyptian questions.2. The situation in Egypt is decidedly better, but the improvement is likely to be only temporary, unless the Report of the Milner Commission is favourable to Egyptian aspirations.In spite of the improvement of the general situation, we may expect the continuance of minor troubles, such as attacks on British officers and soldiers, which are probably engineered by agitators in order to drive the Government to strong repressive action, and also to provoke reprisals by British troops.3. The main causes of unrest in Egypt, according to Sirri Pasha, seem to be : [a.) The machinations of Zaghloul Pasha. This man is a strong, able and comparatively honest politician, who has been driven into bitter hostility to the British by our refusal to accept him as a member of the Egyptian Government. It might still not be too late to win him back to more moderate opinions.(6.) The employment of numerous British officials, said to be idle, ignorant and ineffi-cient, in the lower posts of the Epyptian Government Services. This causes much bitterness among educated Egyptians, who see posts, for which they may be well qualified, handed over to Englishmen with little knowledge of the work and none of the language or people, and who, nevertheless, receive far higher pay than the Egyptian would be ready to accept. A reduction in the number of these officials is a matter of importance and it has, no doubt, been recommended by the Milner Commission.Military.1. A number of points have been brought to my notice by General Congreve, and I have already written to the War Office to draw attention to them. Some of the most important are here repeated for the sake of further emphasis.2. The remounting of the cavalry in Egypt and Palestine is unsatisfactory. No cavalry remounts have reached Egypt since June, 1916. Units are under strength in horses and many of the officers and men are badly mounted.3. As a result of too rapid demobilization the technical services are undermanned, and tKere is a serious shortage of motor drivers, mechanics, signallers and Royal Army Medical Corps trained men. In consequence, British fighting units have been depleted to supplement this shortage, and in some cases have become dangerously weak.Native Egyptians are used to supplement the motor drivers and mechanics, but they require high pay, are bad drivers and mechanics, and ruin their lorries and cars.4. There is a good deal of discontent among the troops owing to their still being on a war basis in regard to the supply of necessaries. The Army in Egypt should now be on a peace basis for all things which affect the comfort of the men. The issue of part-worn clothing to replace worn-out garments is creating great annoyance among the rank and file.5. The building of cantonments should be pushed on without delay. The men are now living under canvas in most unfavourable conditions.Sites for cantonments have not yet been bought, and until this has been done, no buildings can be put up. Apart from the necessity of early construction, it will, be a considerable economy for the Government to purchase the sites at once, as prices are likely to rise considerably after the signature of the Peace Treaty.6. Non-commissioned officers are anxious to have their families sent out, and there is a good deal of discontent over this question, which may lead to the resignation of a number of valuable men.7. The supply of trained nurses from Army Funds to look after the married families is necessary.
GNotes on Jugo-Slavia.   (Visited 16th-19th April.)1. The Serbians are a fine race, but appear to be 200 years behind Central and Western Europe in civilization ; they are so inferior to the Croats, Slovenes and Dalmations in education and modern culture that it will be most, difficult to organize and administer Jugo-Slavia under the present methods, i.e., with the capital at Belgrade mid with a majority of Serbian ministers.The present Government at Belgrade, which is mainly Serbian, is incompetent. Most of the ministers have no real experience of administration, e.g., the Minister of Communications is a priest.   The pay of the ministers is so low that bribery and corruptioD are inevitible. &quot;&apos;:2. The army has great fighting qualities and their general staff is said to be-efficient. The people are, however, hyper-oriental in their habits and seem to be lacking in energy and progressive character. The civil administration is not up to modern standards, and it is unlikely that Jugo-Slavia will ever prosper under the present regime. The administration and organization should be in the hands of Croats,. Slovenes and Dalmations, many of whom have had training and experience under the ex-Austro-Hungarian Government.   The army might remain under Serbian control.3. If Jugo-Slavia is to continue in its present form and to become a prosperous State, it is essential for trade to be opened up. For this, the development of. communications by road, rail and river, is a necessary first step, and relations with the-neighbouring States must be improved.4. The Serbian people are not hard workers like the Bulgarians or Hungarians,, and are less intelligent. Serbian officials are friendly and plausible, and are free with promises, which they never intend to carry out unless further pressure is applied.5. During our motor journey through Serbia, it was clear that the municipal administration is in a backward, almost primitive, state. There are no arrangements for lighting the streets, even in the larger towns in the interior of the country.. There is a complete absence of sign-posts or notice boards of any description. The roads are in a shocking condition, and no attempt whatever is being made to-improve them.6. Little work was being done in the fields, in strong contrast to the activity seen, immediately after crossing the Bulgarian frontier. Although the crops seemed poor,. there was a good deal of cultivation. The people looked well and contented, but the; shortage of young men was very marked. We saw plenty of pigs and sheep, and a. number of bullocks, horses, ponies and mules; there is a serious lack of milch cows, due to their having&apos; been taken away by the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians, and no&apos; butter was to be had anywhere in Serbia except at Belgrade. Otherwise, there is no-shortage of food in Serbia.7. Accommodation is limited, partly owing to the damage done during the war,, and partly owing to the influx of Russian refugees, who abound in the larger towns; there were said to be 14,000-15,000 in Belgrade alone. Hotels are bad and primitive, even in Belgrade. At Jagodina the best room in the best hotel was about 12 feet by 8 feet in size, with no furniture but a bed and washing stand, the latter equipped with only a jug and basin, kt Nish, all our efforts and those of the local authorities to secure accommodation failed completely, until the British Red Cross Mission came to our rescue and put us up in their hospital; the town was apparently crammed with Russian refugees.8. Belgrade, showed few signs of the war, although the bridges (road and rail) oyer-the River Save had been destroyed.   The road bridge has not yet been repaired ; the railway bridge is not completed, but trains can cross it at a slow pace.   There is no. bridge across the Danube.The town, in spite of its wonderful situation, is not by any means a modern capital in fact, it resembles a large village and is very Oriental.   Most of the streets are narrow and badly kept,&quot; and the general  impression  is one of poverty and backward civilization.Bulgarian prisoners were at work in and close to the town.9. In criticising conditions in Serbia, it must be remembered that the country has. not yet had time to recover from a long period of hostile occupation, from the ravages of war in general, and- from its great losses in man power.   The people at present prefer, quite naturally, to re-establish their homes rather than work for public purposes.10. The British are decidedly popular in Serbia, and this popularity is kept up by the good work being done by our Red Cross Mission. Our trade connections are indifferent, and seem to lack official support. t
11, Owing to a railway strike which commenced on the day of my arrival  16th April-rl was obliged to continue the journey to Sofia by road, which enabled a much better idea to be gained of the country and people.   The Serbian military -authorities very kindly placed two bars at my disposal.Notes on Bulgaria. &apos; (Visited 19ith^21st April.) &apos;Politico!&apos;.1. The people are groaning under the terms of the Peace Treaty, wfrich they -consider to be unfair an$ unduly harsh.   They dp not un4erstand why Greece should receive any Bulgarian territory, and regard the cession po, Qree.ce of Western Thrace as .an iniquity, especially as Bulgaria is thereby deprived of all really free access to the Mediterranean. - ,2, The Bulgarians appear to be a sturdy and industrious race, with fair intelligence. The country looked prosperous, and much work was being done in the fields. The number of young men was noticeably far greater than in Serbia, where the war losses have been so much heavier.There is no real shortage of food in Bulgaria, though the high prices cause discontent. There appears to be no serious tendency towards Bolshevism, and the people looked fit and contented in general.3. King Boris is popular and a figure of great importance in the country.The most important Minister is M. Stamboulisky, who has many enemies, but is a &apos; clever statesman.   He is said to be the originator of the Labour Law, which is intended to compel all Bulgarian subjects, both male and female, to do two hours&apos; work per diem for the State.   This Bill may, however, undergo considerable modifications; women will probably be released from the obligation, and many exemptions will be allowed.4. Sofia is a well laid-out modern capital, very different in this respect from . Belgrade ; although manv of its streets are narrow and squalid, it has fine thorough far-s and squares, with buildings worthy of, at any rate, a small capital.5. The British, who at one time stood highest in the respect and esteem of the Bulgarian people, have lost much of their popularity owing to their support of Greece. .A mark of Bulgarian friendship was shown by the action of their railway authorities in placing a special saloon at my disposal, for attachment to the train from Sofia to &apos; Constantinople on the 21st April, there being no sleeping car on that day.6. The Chief of the French Mission, General de Gondrecourt, is a man of considerable charm and ability. He criticized strongly the Allied policy&apos;in giving Western Thrace to Greece, and expressed himself in javour of allowing the Bulgarians to exercise some method of compulsion to raise their armed forces to the strength fixed by the Peace Treaty.He showed his personal friendliness by coining to see me off at the railway station -at a very early hour on the morning of 21st April.Military.1. In the course of a visit which General Nerosof, the Chief of Staff of the Bulgarian Army, paid me on 20th April he was at great pains to impress upon me the impossibility of raising a sufficient army in Bulgaria by voluntary service. He pointed out that the Bulgarian people are mainly agricultural, and that, in the existing conditions, none but the most undesirable men would accept voluntary military service, and that in any case the cost would be prohibitive. He pleaded for permission to use some form of compulsion to raise an army of the size allowed by the Treaty.2. The Bulgarian rolling stock is in bad condition. Many engines are out of order, and a great deal of rolling stock in a dilapidated state w^as seen standing about at the various stations.   There is a serious shortage of coal.4. A great many soldiers are to be seen, hut this may be due to their possession of uniform which the men continue to wear in spite of being demobilized.Miscellaneous.1. Feeling in France and Italy. The French seem rather more friendly now (end of May) than early in April, at the time of the advance to Frankfurt, but are still decidedly suspicious of us ; there is no doubt that the tactics of the Northcliffe Press have a strong effect in fostering this feeling of suspicion and in causing irritation against the policy of our Government.
The Italians are in general unfriendly to us and apt to be touchy, especially when they consider us to be adopting a patronizing attitude or treating them as inferiors-General Duncan (Military Attache^ Eome) is of opinion that matters are improving in this respect.2. The Situation in Central and South-East Europe.My opinion has always been that some form of Danubian Confederation is essential if peace and order are to be restored in Central and South-East Europe. This opinion has been strengthened. I consider that it is of the greatest importance for the Allies-to set up some controlling machinery, such as an Allied High Commission, at a central point like Vienna or Budapest, to direct and co-ordinate rail and river communications, financial and economic questions, trade, &amp;c, among the States of the ex-Austro-Hungarian Empire. If this is not done, war between those States is very likely and-chaos probable, and Austria may join Germany at a comparatively early date.Wm. Thwaites, Major-General.
