This document is the property of His Britannic MajestyJs Government,   ggjj-   -SECRET.THE CABINET.present tendency of wages.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith for the consideration of my colleagues a note by the Financial Gen. No. 6 Secretary of the War Office on the recent memorandum by the Minister of Transport    51 ^ (CP. 1465).w. s. c.The War Office.6th July, 1920.Note by the Financial Secretary op the War office.The recent re-transfer of the munition factories and allied departments from the Ministry of Munitions makes the War Office again one of j the departments of State principally interested in questions of industrial wages.I desire to support the recommendation of the Minister of Transport that an enquiry should be held into the general position and tendency of the present-day wages movement. The double stratification of wages, by trades and by employers, which has for some, years past been made use of by labour to force continual increases of wages all round, is perhaps most clearly seen in large Government establishments employing a great variety of trades. An increase secured by one trade in negotiation with private employers cannot be denied to the men of that trade in Government establishments; and it immediately sets up a claim that an increase given to one class of Government employee in, say, Woolwich Arsenal, must be extended to other employees in the same area and thence to other areas.It is one of the weaknesses of the Whitley scheme that it does not definitely deal with this difficulty. It does not lay down, for instance, whether engineers in railway shops are to act through the Whitley Councils of the engineers or of the railwaymen. At present they claim the advantages of both connections.There is to-day no clear principle or theory of wages, either in Government employment or outside it; and until we.have such a theory accepted by both employers and employed, we cannot escape unrest.(B20/311)   100   7/20   h&amp;S  8375wo
