CONFIDENTIAL.No, 17Notes on the present Political Situation in Central Asia.Notes on the present Political Situation in Central Asia.The state of political and religious unrest which exists to-day throughout the Middle East from the borders of the Black and Caspian Seas southward through Trans-Caucasia to Persia and eastward through Turkestan and Afghanistan to the northern frontier of India-is a legacy of the Great War, which may be directly attributed to the collapse of the Russian and Turkish Empires. States and races which were held together either under the autocracy of the Russian Czars, or by the traditional religious ascendancy, or the military despotism of the Turkish&quot; Padishahs, have drifted apart, and the inevitable result lias been a revival of racial feuds and religious differences. The anti-British attitude, Which is so conspicuous a feature of the present agitation in this part of the world, can be traced to the work of German agents during the war, to the steady and persistent progress of Bolshevik propaganda, and to the necessarily protracted discussions of the Supreme Council in dealing with the settlement of the Turkish Empire, which afforded the Turkish Nationalists time and opportunity to incite the patriotic and religious sentiments of the Moslem races.German Influence in the Caucasus.German intrigues in the Caucasus date from a period before the beginning of the war, but it was the capture of Baghdad by the British iu March 1917 which, by closing one end of the Berlin-Baghdad railway, forced the German military authorities to turn their attention to the development of German interests in the Caucasus, in order to carry out the policy of German penetration into Asia by means of Baku and Bokhara. It was just about this time that the disintegrating effects of the revolution in Russia brought about the collapse of the Russian forces which were operating from South Russia, through the Caucasus, across the Caspian Sea, through North-west Persia to the east of Baghdad, where they were in touch with the British/ The way was thus made easy for the advance of the Turkish army, acting in pursuance of German aims, into the Southern Caucasus. Iu order, if possible, to prevent the enemy from obtaining control of the Trans Caucasian railway line from Batuin to Baku, and with it possession of the valuable oil-fields at the latter place, the minerals in the Caucasus Mountains, and the grain and cotton from the shores of the Caspian Sea, a small British force, under the command of Major-General Dunsterville, was sent to Baku early in 1918. It was hoped that the presence of this force would stiffen :the resistance to the Turkish invasion of. the newly-formed Tartar republic of Azerbaijan. The expedition failed in its object, largely owing to the treachery and cowardice of the local Armenian population, and in September of the same year General Dunsterville was obliged to with-draw his troops from Baku. The town then passed into the possession of the Turks, who remained there until the following winter, when their troops were officially withdrawn in conformity with the terms of the* Sec &quot;The Adventures of Dunsterforcp,&quot; by Major-General Dunstcrvillc. 0  ( 33)11343-1  Pkl76 225  7/20  E&amp;S A
Armistice. Tho Azerbaijan Republic was then reconstituted, and inde-pendent republics were also formed in Georgia and in tho Armenian district of Erivan.The Republics of the Caucasus.The Azerbaijan Government, which entirely controlled the fuol supplies of the Trans-Caucasian railway system, claimed to administer the whole of the former Russian province of Baku, and parts of the provinces of Daghestan and Elizavetpol. Politically the republic has been torn between various parties representing the Nationalist Neutrals (the Miissawad party), the Social Democrats (the Itichad party), and the Bolsheviks (the Gummet party). Until the recent Bolshevik coup at Baku the Government of the republic was in the hands of a coalition representing the Mussawads and the Socialists. This Government came into power after the Armistice in the autumn of 1918 after the evacuation of Baku by the Turks, and professed friendship with the Allies, from whom it secured, in January 1919, an official recognition of the inde-pendence of the republic. Pro-Turkish and pro-Russian influences were, however, at work. The Itichad party abused the Mussawads as minions of the Entente, &quot; those exploiters of the Moslem race,&quot; and as traitors to Islam. As long ago as October 1919 a military convention was signed at Constantinople which provided for the organisation and training of the Azerbaijian army by Turkish officers. The army of the republic is mainly composed of Turks, who remained at Baku when the main Turkish force retired from the town, and of Russian officers who joined it after the defeat of Denikin&apos;s Volunteer Army. It was probably largely due to the influence of the army that the extremists at Baku were successful in overthrowing the Coalition Government and replacing it by a Bolshevik Government.The real significance of this Bolshevik triumph lies in the immediate effect which the fall of Baku has had throughout the whole region of the Caucasus. The Georgians, who had hitherto offered some opposition to the approach of the Red troops over the mountain passes from Vladikav-kas, have also made peace with the Soviet Government, the peace treaty being actually signed on the 8th of May, and Tiflis beflagged in honour of the event. The Armenian republic of Erivan is also reported to have adopted the same policy.The position of this latter republic since its foundation has been one of extreme difficulty. Its situation in the centre of an area in which the Turkish Nationalists have been particularly active, and where the pan-Turanian gospel has been preached assiduously, is particularly unfortunate. During the greater part of its existence the republic has been engaged in a life and death struggle with the Tartars of Azerbaijan, who contend that its territory should be limited to the two districts of Novo-Bajazet and Alexandropol. The Armenian republic is looked upon by the Nationalists as an obstacle to Turanian unity, and although, up to the present time, it has been able to maintain itself against its enemies, it is obvious that it could not continue the struggle with any hope of success against the Nationalists supported by the Bolsheviks. Whether or not the independence of the republic will be respected, and the lives and liberties of its inhabitants be secured, by means of the treaty which its Government has concluded with the Soviet Government, remains to be seen. It does not seem likely that, in the event of a general Turkish Nationalist rising in conjunction with the Bolsheviks, the Armenians of Erivan will be spared from the massacre which is the usual fate of their race when the Turks are in a warlike mood,
* For British consumption the Bolsheviks themselves define their role merely as that of peacemakers between the various local Governments, and pose as the protectors of the Armenians, whom the Powers have shown themselves so inefficient to defend. Georgia and Azerbaijan they state to be under the jurisdiction of a mixed commission under their presidency, the business of which will be to define frontiers, &amp;c. In the no man&apos;s land between Armenia and Azerbaijan they depict their troops of occupation.as the one restraint on mutual massacre between Turk and Armenian, while describing merely as peace negotiations the pressure which they are maintaining upon the unfortunate Armenian Government.Situation in the Caucasus.It is difficult, if not impossible, when dealing with a country like the Caucasus, in which the relations between races and creeds are so inextricably iuterwoven, in which new political forces are at work, and Where all the ancient ties have been torn asunder by war and revolution, to form any just appreciation of the situation. It is fairly clear, liow-ever, that, for the time being at any rate, the Bolsheviks have scored a signal success, with the result that Bolshevism has at last obtained a footing inside the door of Central Asia. The Red troops are now within 160 miles of Batum, and, although it may still be possible to secure the safety of that town, it would seem a task of almost insuperable difficulty for the Allies to protect the Trans-Caucasian railway system, and to preserve the land communication between the Mediterranean aud Mesopotamia ; nor, with the forces available, would it appear possible for them to prevent the Bolsheviks from advancing south to the assistance of the Turkish Nationalist Army in Anatolia. But, although the Soviet Government may have . come to terms with the various republican Governments in the Caucasus, it does not by any means imply that the population of this region as a whole has accepted the doctrines of Com-communism. On the contrary, it iB extremely doubtful whether Communism, in spite of Bolshevik propaganda and the presence of Bolshevik troops, has made much progress outside the towns. The spirit of lawlessness and unrest, which during a period of revolution must always be prevalent,, certainly exists throughout the whole of this region, and, so long as the Volunteer Army under Denikin&apos;s command was in being, the revolutionary spirit which was carefully fostered by Bolshevik and Turkish agents manifested itself in various risings, especially among the hill tribes in lnquehetia, Daghestan, and Chechnia. These tribes eventually formed themselves into a separate republic which at first professed itself to be Bolshevik. As soon, however, as the Volunteer Army was definitely defeated, the hillmen turned against the Bolshevik emissaries, and, in collusion with Nuri Pasha, the Turkish Nationalist leader, drove them out of the country. The hillmen seem then to have got tired of the Turks^ and Nuri Pasha found it expedient to return to Baku, where he decided to throw in his lot with the Bolsheviks, and is reported to have been instrumental in bringing about the recent revolution in that town. The intention of the hillmen, who do not appear to be inspired by the pan-Turanian gospel, is said to be to maintain their independence at all costs. Their attitude is not unlikely to be that of the majority of the rural population throughout the Caucasus. Unless, therefore, the Soviet Government is prepared to embark upon a regular military campaign to enforce its authority in this part of the world, it is unlikely that it will succeed in re-uniting under its&apos;rule these scattered fragments of the old Russian Empire. Such may be the ultimate intention of Lenin and his associates.* There are not wanting signs that the present Government at Moscow is gradually adopting the Asiatic programme of the Tzars, but, for the time being, it is probable that the Bolsheviks will content themselves with a less ambitious programme.   They have succeeded in
establishing themselves in the Caucasus and are in possession of Baku and the surrounding oil-fields. Their position is a strong one, and, if they can.succeed in maintaining good relations with the Governments of. the various republics, there is no immediate reason -why they should endeavour definitely to annex them. The Caucasians are anxious to sell their surplus products, especially naphtha, to the Russians, and it is probable that the object of the Bolshevik advance has been directed mainly, if not entirely, to secure possession of oil and other commodities with which to improve their commercial position with the outside world. It must not be forgotten that the principal anxiety of the Soviet Government at the present time is to revive Russian trade, and that consequently it is unlikely to adopt a militant policy which temporarily might render it more difficult for it to obtain the most valuable exports of which it stands in need, and which it can only find in the Caucasus.At the same time, it must also be borne in mind that the Bolshevik southern advance appears to have been made in collusion with the Turkish Nationalists, and that the Bolsheviks are now in a position, if they so desire, to move their army into Anatolia. In Turkish Nationalist circles in Europe it is confidently asserted that the Soviet Government has already supplied the Turkish Nationalist Army with vast.quantities of war material, and that an agreemept is in existence by which the Bolsheviks have pledged themselves to assist Mustapha Kernel. According to these reports active operations designed to embarrass the Allies, especially Great Britain, are to begin when the Turkish Government definitely rejects the terms of peace.*In connection with these rumours, it is worth while considering shortly the course of the policy hitherto pursued by the Bolsheviks in Asia generally, and in Persia and Afganistan in particular.Bolshevik Policy in Central Asia. VEver since their first rise to power, Lenin and his associates have made no secret of their fixed determination to join the long-sufiering Eastern races &quot; to the oppressed family of the whole world &quot; under the reign of Communism. Their policy has been to spread discontent throughout the whole of Asia, and to endeavour to arouse a pan-Islamic movement, mainly directed against Great Britain, as the leading Imperialist power in the East. Their alliance with the Turkish Nationalist move-ment, to which further reference is made in this pamphlet, has no doubt assisted their propaganda, but its principal strength is due to the bad economic conditions and the general unrest which, in Asia as in Europe, are largely the consequences of the war. The more intelligent Bolshevik leaders have probably now learned that any such political conception as Mohammedan Communism is not feasible, and this is the most likely explanation for the closing of the &quot; Central Propaganda Bureau for Oriental Peoples,&quot; which was set up in Moscow early in, 1919f the* The first attack is to be upon Smyrna,, followed immediately by an attack by the Azerbaijanis and Arabs on Mesopotamia, by way of Persia, to turn the British right. A simultaneous rising is planned to take place in India, and arrangements are said to have been made for an Afghan attack should the Mesopotamian attack prove successful. It is interesting to note, however, that not much confidence seems to be placed in the support of the Indian Mohammedans.i&quot; t It is reported that this Bureau was closed in March of this year. It is probable, however, that &quot; the League for the Liberation of Islam&quot; (Ittihadi SelametiIslam) which was formed in Moscow, under the auspices of the Mussulman section of the Oriental Department of the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, still exists. Representa-tives of Russian Mohammedan organisations, and of the Turkish, Persian, Afghan, Egyptian, and Hindoo Nationalist Parties serve on this league, which is assisted financially by the Soviet Government. Its central committee is1 at Moscow, and there ai&apos;p sub-committees at Berlin Sivas; and Tashkent.
main object of which was to effect the immediate union&apos; of all Eastern peoples for the purpose of a combined attack against British rule in Asia.The Bureau endeavoured to deal with the East as a whole, but its propaganda was largely national and religious in character, because it had necessarily to be adapted to the various races and creeds to which it was addressed. It soon became apparent, however, that the inherent con-tradictions between the political and social theories of Communism and the tenets of religion in general, and of Islam in particular, would prevent any widespread acceptance of Bolshevik doctrines by Eastern races. In spite of this, the propaganda of the Bolshevik agents, who availed themselves of every means to foment discontent and to foster racial and religious animosities, undoubtedly succeeded in gaining supporters in Turkestan, Persia, and Afganistan, and in preparing the ground for political and social revolution.The policy of the Bolsheviks at the present time appears to have changed, and is a further proof of the political adaptability which is their most dangerous characteristic. They found by their experience in Tash-kent, and other places where their Commissars endeavoured to force Communism upon the people against their wishes, that it was useless to attempt to dragoon Mohammedans into Communism. Their methods now, therefore, are more conciliatory, and are designed to induce their Eastern neighbours to live at peace with them, and to reopen commercial relations with Russia. They have, in this way, succeeded in arriving at an agreement with the Amir of Bokhara. They have promised to refrain from any incitement to disorder within the Amir&apos;s territory, in return for which he has agreed to co-operate with them in pan-Islamic propaganda, to export grain to Russia, and to accept Bolshevik currency in payment. He has also allowed Bolsheviks to come into his country.The exact relations which exist between the Bolsheviks and the Afghans are more difficult to understand, because, although the former have made the most strenuous efforts to obtain a controlling influence in Kabul, and have certainly succeeded in arousing the militant instincts of the Afghans, it is by no means clear that the Amir of Afghanistan is acting in strict co-operation with them. It is reported that the Bolsheviks distrust him and are becoming increasingly suspicious of his political designs. He is credited with the intention of forming a Mohammedan Confederation in Central Asia, and to be merely utilising the support of the Bolsheviks, and of the Turkish Nationalists, to assist him in the further-ance of his own schemes. The administrative control which the Afghans have assumed in Turkestan, and the assurances which they are said to have given secretly to the Turcomans, and to the Amir of Bokhara,,of their eventual assistance against the Bolsheviks, seem to lend colour to this view of the Amir&apos;s policy. The refusal of the Afghans to support the Bolshevik system of land ownership, and their vigorous protection of the rights of the local population in Turkestan against the Bolshevik Commissars, are also signs that the Amir has no intention of submitting to Russian control. Meanwhile, however, the Afghan policy is clearly anti-British, and is designed, with the assistance of the Bolsheviks and Turkish Nationalists, and by the creation of a Mohammedan solidarity in Asia, to destroy British influence in the East.The success of this ambitious Afghan policy, which of course in its principal object the destruction of British prestige coincides with the immediate aims of the Bolsheviks, largely depends upon the situation in Persia. So long as Great Britain maintains her control in that country any such conception as a Mohammedan Confederation in Central Asia is out of the question. ,The entry of a small Bolshevik force into the Persian frontier town of - Astara, and the seizure of the port of Euzeli in northern Persia by
Bolshevik troops, have drawn public, attention in England to the clanger which is now threatening British interests in Persia. For nearly two years a small British garrison has been maintained at Enzeli. The withdrawal of this force has now been rendered necessary, and there can be little doubt that the Extremists throughout Persia will welcome this withdrawal as a blow to British prestige. There is evidence to prove that the Bolshevik attack on Enzeli was carried out merely for the purpose of destroying remnants of the White forces which had taken refuge at this port, and without definite orders from Moscow.*It is reported that the Soviet Government has ordered the Red troops to evacuate Enzeli the moment that military exigencies permit, but at the same time it disclaims any responsibility for the action of any individual Bolsheviks who may enter Persia. The formation of the Bolshevik republic at Resht indicates that Bolshevik partisans are by no means idle, even if the Soviet Government professedly remains neutral.If it is true, however, as is often contended, that the real key to the Middle East lies in Persia and not in Mesopotamia, it is clear that the proved ability of the Bolsheviks to land a military force in the former country from the Caspian Sea, combined with the complete control which they now exercise in Transcaspia, constitutes a serious menace to British influence in Persia.f It must also be remembered that Russian influence is still strong in Persia, and that a Persian Cossack division, under the command of Russian officers, is the strongest military force in Teheran. It is reported that Starosselsky, the leader of this force, is determined to keep alive Russian interests in the country, whether Bolshevik or Tzarist, with the result that he is actively assisting the Persian democrats and other malcontents in their opposition to the British. He is said to be making every effort to render unpopular the Anglo-Persian agreement, and is acting strictly in accordance with the Bolshevik foreign policy. All Russians indeed, whatever may be their political opinions, welcome the capture of Baku by the Bolsheviks. Extremists naturally look upon it as a political success of the greatest importance, while Monarchists regard it as a sign of the speedy disappearance of all the small republics in the Caucasus, as well as of the resumption of Russian control in Northern Persia.It is unlikely, however, that the Bolsheviks will make any serious attempt to reclaim the Russian sphere of influence in Persia until they have established themselves more firmly in Georgia and Armenia, and gained possession of Batum.Their recent successes have clearly had a considerable effect upon the Persian Government, which has recently sent a mission to Moscow for the purpose of renewing diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Government, and is also accepting friendly overtures from the Afghans. Moreover, the Government by its political timidity and pronounced unwillingness to summon a Migliss (Parliament), without which no serious financial or constitutional reforms cau be undertaken, is either consciously or unconsciously playing into the hands of Extremists, who argue that the agreement with Great Britain is the only cause of strife between the Persians and their &quot; spiritual friends,&quot; the Bolsheviks. It is not easy with the information available to form any. accurate estimate* Dehikin&apos;s fleet had sought, refuge in the harbour of Enzteli, aad it was no doubt considered necessary by the Bolshevik military authorities, in order to obtain com-plete control of the Caspian Sea, to seize these vessels, although it is reported that they are in a bad state of repair, and that it will be some time before they can be made of much use.t Bolshevik troops from Turkestan invaded Transcaspia in 1918. They obtained control.of the railway at Merv, and proceeded to move along it towards-Merv. A British force under the command of General Malleson assisted the Persians to drive back this invasion. In 1919 the British troops were withdrawn.
of the attitude of the Persians generally to the British protectorate. It is said that the people as a whole have only one real political idea, &quot;fair terms for farmers and a guarantee of order. They have no other &quot; political ideas, but in their hatred of the present tyrannical system of &quot; landlordism they unconsciously become true democrats as opposed to &quot; the political democrat, who does not know what the word means.&quot; It would seem, therefore, that, provided the British officials who have been sent to Persia can induce the Government seriously to tackle the. agrarian problem and to pursue a generous policy of domestic reform, it. may be possible to resist the progress of Bolshevism.It is clear, however, that the fall of Baku and the encroachment of the Bolsheviks in Northern Persia have materially changed the situation, and that, unless the population of Persia can be made to realise the good faith of Great Britain and her ability to maintain her position of predominance in the country, there is a grave danger that the Bolsheviks, whenever it may suit them, will be able, either by a policy of peaceful penetration or by means of armed force, to engineer a popular rising which may lead to a revolutionary movement, the consequences of which cannot fail to be far-reaching.The policy of the present Bolshevik leaders, who are anxious for a general cessation of hostilities, and who are probably adopting a threaten-ing attitude on the Persian frontier largely for diplomatic reasons, appears to be designed to win over the Persians by means of propaganda. But if this policy should fail in its object, or should the pan-Turanian and pan-Islamic policy of the Turkish Nationalists prevail at Moscow, an hv vasion of Persia in conjunction with risings in Afghanistan and Kurdistan may be anticipated.The Bolsheviks and the Turkish Nationalists.As has been already suggested in this pamphlet, the source of danger in Central Asia to-day lies in the alliance or understanding which exists between the Bolsheviks and the Young Turks, who are, the real leaders of tlie Turkish National Party.Since the autumn of 1919 the Nationalists have been in control of almost the whole of Turkish territory in Asia Minor. Mustapha Kernel, who is the acknowledged military leader of the National Party, and commands the only serious military force which now exists in Turkey, has shown himself completely independent of the titular Turkish Government in Constantinople, and, posing as the champion of the liberties of the Turkish people, has exercised, and still exercises, a virtual sovereignty over the country.The domestic policy of the Nationalists was outlined at the Congresses of the party held at Erzerum and at Sivas in August and September 1919. It may be summed up as the same policy as that of the Young Turks. It declares the determination of the party not to surrender any Turkish territory, but guarantees full equality of rights to all citizens of the Empire, without distinction of race or religion. The value of this guarantee, as has been pointed out in a recent article by M. Andre Mandelstam,* may be estimated by the recent massacre of several thousand Armenians in Cilicia, for which Mustapha Kernel must be held responsible.The foreign policy. of the Nationalists, which is pan-Turanian and pan-Islamic, is also the policy of the Young Turks, whose leader, Euyer Pasha, acts as a link between Mustapha Kernel and the Bolsheviks, who have now taken the place of the Germans as the active supporters of* See 11 ThaJNaw Europe&quot; Yol. XV-., No. 184, 22nd April 1920.
Turkish national aims.* He and his brother-in-law, Nuri Pasha, are constantly on the move between the Nationalist headquarters in Anatolia and Moscow, Asia Minor, the Azerbaijan Republic, and Turkestan. Enver Pasha is now said to be at Baku in command of a force varying from 20,000 to 50,000 men, and to be organising an attack upon Batum preparatory to effecting a junction with Mustapha KemePs Army.From the above short summary of the relations between the Bolsheviks and the Turkish Nationalists, it is amply apparent that the situation throughout Central Asia to-day is full of dangerous possibilities. Every-thing that unscrupulous and systematic propaganda can accomplish has been done to spread the pan-Islamic and pan-Turanian policy. It has. been successful in the Caucasus, and is making headway in Persia. From a military point of view the Bolsheviks and Nationalists now hold a strong position, for the occupation of Constantinople is of little practical value to the Allies as a means of enforcing their wishes upon Turkey, if the Sultan and his Government have lost control over the rest of the country. With the forces at their disposal the Allied commanders cannot, with any prospect of success, attempt any offensive operations against Mustapha Kernel. His position in Anatolia is a strong one, and his recent, repulse of a French force, which was making its third attempt to advance towards Aintab in Cilicia, and his massacre of French troops at Urfa, clearly prove that he is in command of a fighting force which must be taken seriously into account. His offensive power will of course be materially increased if the Bolsheviks decide to move forward to his assistance.Everything, therefore, would seem to depend upon the policy of the Soviet Government. This will no doubt be dictated by existing conditions in Russia, because, although Lenin and his adherents may entertain dreams of foreign conquest, and are certainly determined to re-assert Russian influence in the East, their first aim must be to insure the stability of their own government at home. This is only possible if they can succeed in restoring the industries and commerce of the country, and they now realize that, without the assistance and co-operation of the Allied Powers and the United States of America, they cannot carry out their purpose. If, therefore, they embark upon fresh military operations&apos; in alliance with the Turkish Nationalists for the avowed object of main-taining the existence of the Turkish Empire against the declared decision of the Allies, and of inflaming the Moslems throughout Asia against Great Britain, they run the risk of losing the foreign assistance upon which they are counting. There is no doubt a section of the Bolsheviks  to which belong the adherents of the old regime in Russia who have thrown in their lot with the new government which is. prepared and anxious for a policy of aggression. They are ready to exploit to the full the energies and ambitions of the Turkish Nationalists in order to restore the ancient Russian Empire, and they are obviously less interested in the maintenance in power of the Soviet Government. This section, however, can have little real influence in the actual direction of the Bolshevik foreign policy, which must rest with Lenin and his immediate adherents. The order for the evacuation of Enzeli, the recognition of the republics in the Caucasus, and the continued commercial negotiations with the Allied Powers rather tend to show, in spite of the rumours to the contrary, that the Bolsheviks, for the present at any rate, are in no hurry to commit themselves too deeply in the military designs of the Turkish Nationalists.* Although Germany is no longer in a condition openly to assist the Turkish agitators, there is evidence to prove that German assistance is being given to them secretly. Djemai Pasha and Talaat Pasha are constantly in Berlin and pan-Islamic propaganda is being carried on continuously in that city and throughout Germany.Printed by Btee and Spotiiswoodb, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.0.4.
