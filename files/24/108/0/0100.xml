-BMBBIl............iiiwmii........hi&quot;\T\ CONFIDENTS425I oirculate ta the Cabinet the draft of a Bill entitled the &quot;Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Prooesses) Dill&quot;. which has been prepared to give effect to a Recommendation adopted by the International Labour Conference held at Washington last November, under Part XIII of the Treaty of Peaoe.    Under Article 405 of the Treaty the Government is required to bring a Reooramendation adopted by the Labour Conference before the competent national authority for the enactment of legislation or other action. Clause I of the Sill prohibitsthe employment of women and young persons under 18 in certain processes involving the use of lead which is specially dangerous.   In some of the prooesses mentioned, e.g. manufacture of white lead, manufacture of electric accumulators, etc. the employment of women and young persons is already prohibited by Home Office Regulations, and in others there is very little employment of women and young persons at present. The Clause therefore will not make any considerable alteration in the present arrangements of the industries.    Clause II prescribes certain preoautionB which are to be observed in lead prooesses when women and young persons are employed.   These precautions follcw the methods which have been adopted in this country for many years past in regard to all the important lead industries.    There are a number of industries, mostly minor industries, which have not yet been brought under Regulation, e.g. industries in which lead paints are used and whioh produce a oertain amount of lead poisoning, and it is desirable that the precautions should be extended to them.E.S.9/7/20.7G149.
