[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] -CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,^rr^r^Mo) Foreign Office.-&apos;^^^v     \ Italy/013., 5 511    k)___^y^^J MEMORANDUMONSIGNOR GIOLITTI AND HIS MINISTRY.1. THE most remarkable feature of the recent fall of Signor Nitti&apos;s Government was the sudden shifting of support from Signor Nitti to Signor Giolitti. The return of the latter to power had been foreshadowed for several weeks past--even the Nationalist and Interventionist papers inclining to favour him on the report that he would attempt to apply the Treaty of London, while it was recalled that on the withdrawal of Signor Orlando from Paris over the Fiume question, Signor Giolitti. gave his vote in favour of the Government. On the occasion of the last Cabinet crisis it was believed that Signor Giolitti himself was averse to accepting power until the Fiume question had been got out of the way, and Signor Nitti&apos;s inability to deal with the internal situation completely demonstrated. The increase in the number of Giolittians in the Cabinet, however, particularly the accession of Signor Giolitti&apos;s principal supporter, Signor Peano, who became Minister of Public Works, and the common report that Signor Nittfs fall had been brought about by the French Ambassador at Rome, owing to French fears that Giolittian influence was about to become predominant these facts heralded an earlier return of Giolitti himself than was generally expected.2. Signor Giolitti&apos;s Ministry is composed of four Liberal Democrats Giolitti&apos;s own party namely, Signor Tedesco, who has held the following posts : Treasury under Giolitti in 1911, Finance under Nitti, 1919 a post which he retains in the present Government; Signor Peano, who was Minister of Public Works in Signor Nittis third Cabinet, formed on the 21st May last, and remains in the same office under Giolitti; Signor Rossi, who again takes over the Colonial Ministry, which he held &quot;under Nitti&apos;s first Government of June 1919; and Signor Raineri,. Minister of Liberated Territories, a portfolio which he held under the Nitti Cabinet of March last. The three Radicals whom Signor Giolitti succeeded where Signor Nitti failed-in inducing to enter his Cabinet, are: Signori Alessio, Fera and Vassallo. Signor Alessio was Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in the Nitti Cabinet of last March and has taken over the portfolio of Industry in the present Government. Signor Fera becomes Minister of Justice. Signor Vassallo, a Sicilian, becomes Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Signor Bonomi, the Reformist Socialist leader, again becomes Minister of War, a post he held in the Nitti Cabinet of March 1920. The other Socialist representative is the Independent deputy for Naples, Arturo Labriola, who becomes Minister of Labour. Of the Popular Party there are two representatives, as compared with three in the last Nitti Cabinet, Signor Rodino having been dropped out. They are Signor Meda, who was the Catholic representative in the Orlando Ministry, and now succeeds to the same office with the portfolio of the Treasury, and Micheli, who again receives the portfolio of Agriculture, which he held under Signor Nitti. The Popular Party, it should be noted, is strongly represented among the Under-Secretaries, no fewer than five being allotted to them. The Foreign Minister, Count Sfbrza, was Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the last Nitti Cabinet. The portfolio of the Ministry of Education has been accepted by Signor Benedetto Croce, the well-known exponent of Hegelian philosophy at Naples University, and director of the review, &quot;La Critica.&quot; He was noted for his pro-German sympathies during the war.3. The present tendency of Giolittis policy, both domestic and foreign, may be gauged from the following passages taken from his electoral speech at Dronero last October, from articles in the pro-Giolittian newspaper, &quot;La Stampa,&quot; of Turin, and from his noteworthy interview with the &quot; Tribune,&quot; of Rome, on the 28th May last: In the Dronero speech Signor Giolitti, after emphasising his support of Italy&apos;s remaining neutral, denied that he had neglected Italy&apos;s military preparations after the Libyan war. Referring to the Treaty of London, he said this was obviously framed in expectation that the war would be very brief, whereas he always foresaw that it would be very long and costly.   Italy&apos;s interest was the maintenance of European equilibrium;[3627]
she was not a guarantor of Belgian neutrality, therefore he opposed the war. He contended that by article 2 of the Treaty of London Italy should have declared war simultaneously on Austria and Germany, but she only declared war*on Germany at a much later date. Concerning Fiume, Signor Giolitti laid all responsibility for the impasse on that Ministry which expressly assigned Fiume to Croatia in the Treaty of London at a.moment when the Allies would have denied Italy nothing.4. Further light on Signor Giolitti&apos;s policy at this time is thrown by the interview which Signor Nitti gave in reply to the Dronero speech to the &quot; Messaggero &quot; on the 17th October (reported in the &quot;Secolo&quot; of the 18th), of which the following is the principal passage : In December 1914 and the following months, Signor Giolitti was of opinion that the Central Empires must of necessity win the war. France, he declared, was a decadent and corrupt country, and had lost much of her former military prowess. (This after the battle of the Marne.) England, a sea Power, had no land army, and if she had she would be beaten because her soldiers were bad land fighters. No reliance could be placed in Eussia. The Central Empires, on the other hand, had extraordinary military resources, and Germany possessed abundant energy, which must have its effect on the outcome of the war, and made her invincible. Her victory would be a blessing to European interests. Italy would be ruined if she intervened on the side of France and Great Britain, the losing parties. Apart from that Italy had no general securities, and the Italian nation had not sufficient grit to make a prolonged resistance.&quot;La Stampa&quot; April 21, 1920 (one of the numerous Giolittian advances to the Socialist Party): As in the Liberal Party the men who wished to spare their country the horrors of war parted company with those who wanted war at any cost, so in the Socialist Party the men who wish to avert the catastrophe of a revolution must break with the advocates of revolution.But a split does not constitute positive action. And the time has come for action. To save the proletariat and&apos;protect its conquests, it is necessary to assume the responsibility of power. Many facts indicate that Signor Turati is by no means without support. Strong men always find followers. And one day the Italian proletariat will hail him and his friends as saviours.&quot;La Stampa,&quot; April 8, 1920:-France has unwittingly done Germany a good turn. If German common-sense rises to the occasion we shall some day see the full consequences of her move. Everybody&apos;s sympathies are with the German Republic, which has so far given proof of its peaceful, liberal and reconstructive tendencies. Europe is realising all the aberrations embodied in the Versailles Treaty. And France, who places all her hopes on that- treaty, is speeding its revision by her terrors and mistakes.&quot;La Stampa,&quot; April 28, 1920 (referring to the Herakleia district) :-Considering that the French privilege, covering one-fifth of the coalfields, i.e,, all that can be worked immediately, remains, Italy will need many years and large capital to sink pits and avail herself of what is given her. Meanwhile, British coal rises in price and the quantities exported diminish.5. In the interview with the &quot; Tribuna,&quot; Signor Giolitti gave utterance to the following views: After stating that he had taken no part in the recent crisis, he went on to say that, in his opinion, Italy&apos;s great need at present was for a programme.oi real reconstruction a necessarily complex affair, seeing the numerous social reforms which were pressing, particularly in regard to the land-workers. But two perils in particular menaced the State: the discredit of Parliament and the parlous state of finances. Parliament had lost its prestige by reason of the continuous employment of Royal Decrees.   This practice must be
abandoned. Parliament must have full powers of legislation, complete control of public expenditure and of the public services, and it must possess equal powers in the matter of foreign affairs, two permanent commissions for foreign affairs being instituted in Chamber and Senate respectively. - Turning to financial matters the member for Dronero remarked that in the current budget there was a deficiency of 18,000,000,000, part of which was covered by debts, and part by the issue of paper money. The last loan realised 7,000,000,000, barely enough to cover the deficit for five months. Had Parliament had any efficient control of public expenditure, Italy would not have contracted 18,000,000,000 of debt in one year. To avert disaster, Signor Giolitti suggested two measures: the revision of contracts entered into during and since the war by the Government, and the application of the capital levy.6. The following press comments on the &quot;Tribuna&quot; interview may be of interest: &quot; Corriere d&apos;Italia &quot; (Clerical): It seems to us that there is lacking in the words of Signor Giolitti that declaration of war which some people pretend to find in them; neither do we see that they outline a programme such as would alienate from him those groups and parties which have shown themselves in line with the Opposition. It would have been interesting, however, to have heard what Signor Giolitti had to say on foreign policy and the Adriatic problem, after the publication of an indiscretion by a newspaper which gave it to be understood that in these matters he was seeking the support and sympathy of the Left.&quot; II Secolo &quot; (Radical) : In these declarations, which are in the nature of an appeal to the deputies and a warning to the country, Signor Giolitti is pressing his candidature for the succession to Signor Nitti. This is not much to be wondered at when he has heard himself referred to as the restorer of public order and the saviour of the sinking ship by those who, during the war, were his most bitter foes. But can it really be that Signor Giolitti is considered the only man capable&apos; of applying the Treaty of London ? That would be the greatest irony of our history.&quot; Idea Nazionale&quot; (Nationalist) (which is uncertain whether it hates Giolitti or Nitti the more) : We have so far had no occasion to change our opinion of the personality and work of that man who, up to May 1915, reigned supreme in Italian politics, and the document yesterday made public certainly does not conduce to any modification of that estimate. Five years ago he put himself beyond the pale of Italian nationality, and there he still remains. His friendship with Billow in 1915 was no greater treachery to the ideals and interests of the Italian nation than the crafty accord with Wilson, with Steed and with Trumbich in 1918, 1919 and 1920, entered into without the concordance of responsible Ministers. Those who, after a long and sanguinary war and a costly victory, would be content with &quot;a mere something &quot; (&quot; parecchio &quot;) have no right to inveigh against those who&apos; would have been content with this &quot; mere something &quot; without war. The Government which has belittled and dishonoured Vittorio Veneto is no more acceptable than the Government which was determined not to see the need for intervention.&quot; Avanti.&quot;   (Extreme Socialist): Signor Giolitti gives us to understand that the current budget has a deficit of 18,000,000,000, which can be covered only by fresh debts or by a fresh issue of paper money: that is, by greatly enhanced prices. The situation, he said, was bordering on national bankruptcy. And the remedy ? To strike at wealth by first transforming bearer bonds into inscribed bonds and then by taxing them enormously. this part of his programme cannot be gainsaid. But one must bear in mind that Signor Giolotti a clever politican has more than once proposed radical schemes of taxation which have never been applied. On the other hand, we shall see how the capitalist banking world will receive these proposals.
7. The trend of Signor Giolitti&apos;s policy on succeeding to office may be summarised as follows: (a.) Foreign. The nomination of Count Sforza to the Foreign Secretaryship maybe taken to indicate that Signor Nitti&apos;s foreign policy will remain practically unaltered. On the two outstanding points, hoAvever, the Adriatic and Albania, Signor G-iolitti has let his views be known, the first in the Italian press, and the second in a conversation with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Eome. As regards the Adriatic, Signor Giolitti&apos;s views are-to the effect that: (1.) Italy will wait for the Jugo-Slavs to make proposals to her, and meanwhile will hold the armistice line.(2.) As for Fiume, the only possible solution is for the Government to come to terms with d&apos;Annunzio as quickly as may be and for regular troops to replace d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s legionaries., Speaking of Albania, Signor GiolHtti stated that it was not his intention to embark on ambitious schemes but to concentrate at Valona, securing merely as much hinterland as was absolutely essential, (b.) Domestic. Apart from indications already given by Signor Giolitti in his interview, which has been quoted, it is clear that in general terms Signor Giolitti proposes to pursue a strong policy in regard to home affairs. Under his direction it seems probable that there will be an end to the Nittian policy of calling off strikes by making large promises impossible of fulfilment, while at the same time the definite political character of the many strikes now proceeding in Italy will be frankly recognised and firmly grappled with. It is the belief on all sides in Italy that Signor Giolitti is the only Italian politician at present capable of taking this strong line, which has made his recent return to office the subject of so much less opposition than would otherwise have been expected.June 21, 1920.o
