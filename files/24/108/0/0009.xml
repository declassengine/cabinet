*tt,LbVZ\ CHAMBERS, 22nd June, 1930,Sir,The Lords Commissioners of His Majestyfs Treasury hare had under consideration tho draft memorandum prepared Toy the Minister of Labour, relative to the grant of allowances to single men undergoing training who have dependent relatives.In reply I am to state that My juords are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a letter addressed by their directions to the Minister of Pensions on the subject of the joint memorandum relative to the grant of a bonus on war pensions.    For the reasons therein stated My Lords are unable to approve the scheme for a temporary bonus and still less the present proposal to which They understand the concurrence of the Minister of Pensions has not been obtained.My Lords observe that the-present scheme is confinod to single men in training living at home who have a widowed mother dependent on them.        It is not clear whether it is intended that the tost should be pre-war (or pre-enlistment) dependence as under the Pension Warrant.    My Lords consider that if the concession were made it would &quot;be difficult to confine it indefinitely to a widowed mother to the exclusion of other cases e.g. an invalid father and mother.    $or indeed is it clear that similar claims would not at once be put forward on behalf of married men who have a widowed mother dependent on them.But the essential point-in Their lordships view, is that the scheme would Immediately re-act on Pensions administration, and They are unable to consider it unless it can be shown that it can be confined to the Training Scheme.    Prima facie this appears quite improbable for even if withheld from the general body of pensioners it can scarcely be
refused to men under treatment who are many times more numerous than men in training.    The estimate of  170,000 as the total cost &quot;for the duration of the (Draining Scheme&quot; would in these circumstances be immensely exceeded,,I amSir.,Your obedient Servant (Sd.) G.1.MRST0W.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 25th June, 1920.
