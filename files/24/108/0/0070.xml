. This Document, \s the Property of  mi LA Military Secret.       Britannic Mm%3%&apos;&apos;3 Government,From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,mh June 1920.(Received 2nd July.)1. A week ago the General Officer Commanding, Meshed Mission, asked istructions as to the role of his mission in event of (a) Bolshevik or Afghan forces crossing the frontier, (b) internal risings against local Persian authorities.In reply to (a), he has been ordered to protect Persian territory against inroads by small parties; if large forces act aggressively he is to avoid committing his force, and is to withdraw and evacuate Meshed if need be.In reply to (b), he is to protect local Persian authorities if applied to, but should not actively intervene unless the safety of his detachment is menaced by his remaining inactive.   Reference to your telegram No. nil of 5th May 1920.2. He now asks for further instructions as to how he should act after the bulk of his force has been withdrawn : (1) Is the mission only to collect information or is it to continue anti-Bolshevik propaganda.(2) If the latter, is this propaganda to be continued (a) only in Persia, (b) in Transcaspia, in which case the Turcomans might be made use of and assisted with money grants to enable their carrying out anti-Bolshevik propaganda, as the issue of arms and ammunition to them appears to be undesirable.The General.Officer Commanding at Meshed finds himself hampered by lack of knowledge as to our policy vis-d-vis Soviet, and anticipates complications until this is clearly defined. We agree with him, for we feel most strongly that officers placed in command of isolated garrisons and missions should be given definite instructions as to their duties, and not be left to decide matters of Imperial importance on their own initiative and responsibility. Further the uncertainty as to whether we are not at peace or war with the Soviet not only places local commanders in difficult position, but also affects our whole military policy. We, therefore, request that Imperial policy in regard to the Soviet Government be explained to us to enable us to give General Officer Commanding, Meshed Mission, definite instructions.
