memorandum by secretary of state for india.GAS  WARFARE.The President of the Board of Education will doubtless deal with the general arguments of the Imperial General Staff. But as India is quoted as affording a particular instance in which &quot; British lives have been sacrificed owing to our refusal to use gas.&quot; I must point out that the capture of the Afghan Fort of Spin Baldak occurred on 27th May 1919, only 17 days after th e first suggestion made by the War Office, in a telegram to the Commander-in-Chief dated the 10th May, that gas might he useful in India. Brigadier-General Foulkes only left for India on the 11th, June 1919 to experiment with samples of gas with a view to testing its usefulness in Indian conditions. There can therefore have been no question of a &quot;refusal to use gas &quot; or of lives being unnecessarily sacrificed owing to such a refusal in the only &quot; typical instance &quot; which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff adduces.Further, our casualties in capturing the Afghan position, which consisted of the main fort and the fortified hills to the north-east of it, were 18 killed and 19 wounded. The enemy&apos;s casualties were 3^0 killed, 169 captured. The price paid for the capture of the Fort does not appear to have been excessive, even without the assistance of gas.We have no information as to the ^perpetration of horrors upon our wounded in the recent frontier operations, but a case was reported of a village being completely destroyed as a punishment for the fact that a human head was found in a jar. It is of course well known that the frontier tribesmen and Afghans are not chivalrous enemies. My argument was that we shall make them still less so if we lower ourselves to their levelE. S.
