Jo...93-Far .thp week ended 26 th. Juner1920,Trade..There are strong indications that the Krassin negotia-tions for the resumption of trade, will prove abortive.   The Soviet Government endeavour to convert the proposed commercial conferencesone of his usual protests against the restrictions placed on KrassinJs communications with the Soviet Government, and charges H.M. Government with the responsibility of the results of the&apos; negotiations.5sthonia.No material change,   Trade reconstruction with Soviet Russia is proceeding very slowly owing to inefficiency of Soviet business organisation,   &quot;fee chief difficulty is the small export capacity ofEsthonia, and the insecure political situation, fee reorpaisation of the railway transport is only intermittent and desultory. The Walk dispute&apos;with Latvia&apos;continues.-   The latterfs attitude is conciliatory while that of esthonia is so aggressive as to call forth a rebuke from RJiv Commissioner..Latvia.Peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks are proceeding more satisfactorily.   The Lettish General Staff are reported to be against the Polish aggressive campaign. The former agreement with Poland included Latvian help if&quot;Soviet attacked Polish territory, and vice versa.Lithuania.Lithuanian Military Officers consider that the Polish situation south of Dvinsk is critical and that it is unlikely-the Poles will be successful in resisting the expected Bolshevik offensive.   They think Vilna may  fall and that the possibility of Lithuania breaking her neutrality may be considered.   The Bolshevik policy on the other hand, is.to do nothing to alienate Lithuanian sympathy owing to the threat to their right flank.Poland and Ukraine.The situation remains critical.   The Polish retirement continues and a new Bolshevik offensive on the left flank is threatening (vide Lithuanian situation).   Soviet appeals to Jussian national sentiment to resist the Polish attack continue&quot; to be made and there are indications that the national spirit is becoming regenerated.   The disentegration of Petlurafs influence m the Ukraine is becoming more apparent.   The Ukrainian army continue however actively to cooperate with the Poles. Srom reliable and corroborative reports the Polish occupation of Kiev was orderly, and on evacuation no damage whatsoever was done to public buildings- as alleged-by the mendacious Bolshevik W/T rep6r.it.
On 23rd June the Finnish Government communicated to the Soviet Government that their armistice conditions werel-1,   Retention of status quo on the&apos;frontier except Bep&amp;la, which is to be promptly evacuated...2.   In&quot; Ladoga and Gulf of Finland the 1917 frontiers were to be observed.3.   Armistice to be of indefinite duration and terminable at two days notice.Further reports have been received of the supply by sea of munitions of war from Germany to Finland..   It is reported that Soviet Forces are evacuating Petchenga and the Murman Coast..   If confirmed., this will remove the greatest obstacle to peace.v..It has been decided to refer the Aaland Islands contro-versy to the Council of the League of Nations at the request of ELM. Government.Sweden.The proposed settlement by the League of Nations of the Aaland Islands question has somewhat cleared the atmosphere.Denmark-.The Sloop &quot;ASPHODEL&quot;, now sold to Denmark, is expected to arrive at Harwich&quot;on or about 7th July for turning over to the Danish Government.The visit of the Battle Cruiser Force to Denmark was concluded on 23rd June..   The political result is stated to be most satisfactory.lara Sea JMiei Expedition.A Press report of 21st June states that Captain Sverdrup of Ice-breaker &quot;SVIATOGOH&quot; reports that he found the Bolshevik Ice-breaker &quot;SOLOVEI BUDIMIiiOvITCH&quot; drifting in the Kara Sea.. All her crew and passengers have been embaried and are being taken back to Norway.   Latest Beuter report states &quot;SVIAT0G03&quot; is ashore, but hopes to get off,Russia. Internal Conditions.The general situation, as reported before, hinges on the result of the economic negotiations.&apos;   There has been a recrudescence of national spirit owing to the Polish offensive, which will undoubtedly strengthen the existing dictatorship of Lenin and Trotsky and prolong its life.    Should, however,&quot;the Polish offensive be discontinued and peace negotiations result, then the imperative necessity of resuming friendly economic intercourse will come to the fore..   Frantic attempts are made to deal with the transport problem, but until a general peace is ensured, it is difficult to see how any progress can be made. A complete cessation of movement on all Soviet railways is consider-ed by experts to be inevitable.    Even if new locomotives and carriages are received from abroad the general disorganisation of the railways will continue - the people having been taught to adopt a system of-&quot;natural means of existence&quot;, each locality with oriental apathy exists for itself, and the need therefore of rail-way transport for export of goods is, to their minds, no longer necessary&quot;;    This attitude is     -similar to that of a Central African tribe-.    The economic development of the country as a whole is therefore entirely arrested -and this is due to the-violation by the Soviet Communism of the unalterable laws of economic development. -
BL4GK SEA &amp;       TOME AN.Crimea.The situation is unchanged.    Active cavalry&apos;reoonnaiasano^s-continue and General Wrangel is consolidating his position on the mainland.    Having learnt&quot; the lesson of KolcnakTs and Denikinfs failure, he has wisely reorganised the rear of the fighting line and conciliated the peasantry.    The line now runs -Viadlmlrovka, northwards to Bolshaya Tamak and thence westward to Michailovka Balki and eastwards to Dnieper and the sea. &apos; A Moscow W/T reports that General Schilling has been executed by Wrangel for his treachery in surrendering Odessa.

This can be done by the Petrovsk - JJostov ifeilway and roust be borne in mind in view of the necessity of countering General tfrangelfs Nafel operations.   General Wrangel has been informed by the C?IE*C., Mediterranean,Persian. LUtpral. -  -The Bolshevik manace to Persia is accentuated by .the presence in Persia of the Cossacks under Starosselsky.   The G.0.C, * Mesopotamia points out that the advance of Bolshevik forces by Tabriz and Enzeli combined with a probable siinultaneous coup by these Cossacks would be beyond the powers df any troops he&apos;&apos;can spare or maintain in O. Persia.    A retirement on Ramadan would result.    It was reported on 15th June that bolshevik warships bombarded Persian Astara and troops were landed and cut the telegraph line.There are indications that a Bolshevik ultimatum to Persia may be expected in the near future *    The latter must benJ to &quot;force Majeure&quot; and the terms imposed are almost certain to include withdrawal of British troops from Persian soil, thus giving- the coup de grace to our moribund nrest.Age in the Caspian.The Naval Mission to Persia, under Commodore Norris, arrived at Teheran on the 18th June,.....

The Japanese Government have reported that now minesweeoing is completed, free passage of ships is allowed north of Kastries Bay to Cape Jaore (?) after 20th June, but landing of arms and munitions is prohibited unless under Japanese control.    &quot;The French Government have informed the Admiralty that the French General at Vladivostock wishes the British, ships detailed for the repatriation of 3,000 Czechoslovaks to be at Vladivostok by 15th July 1920^ &quot;c&quot;Governments that they bad considered the very serious position summar-ised to them by the riaval and Iviilitary authorities aThe allied Commissioners&apos;reported to their  respectiveis position jis follows;-&quot;Constantinople was threatened from the Asiatic side and might be from the European side. On the Dardanelles side food supplies &quot;might be endangered.    The Allied forces could not counter all these dangersControl of Constantinople and the Straits had, however, to be&apos;&apos; securer; at all costs and consequently reinforcements must be forth-comingi&quot; .&quot;\The High Commissioners also pointed out that, as foreseen, the Nationalist &quot;forces were set in motion as soon as the peace terms became known.   The Allies were now faced with the necessity of employ-&quot; ing force to impose their will, or, alternatively, modifying the Treaty. * &quot;   -The Nationalist advance might.conceivably start a movement in Constantinople for the overthrow of &quot;the existing government and its replacement by a Nationalist;Government.    Are&apos; the High Commissioners to suppress such a movement 6r to maintain order while allowing events to take their course?     In the former^a collaose of the existing Government mii?ht ensue and the Allies would have to take the Govern-ment and ^clministration into&apos; their own hands.    In the latter case they would find themselves confronted with a Government representingments are to be desoatchedi    But if the   Allies are not prepared to undertake a new war with Turkey and are prepared to modify the Treaty as regard? the Territorial Clauses then the second alternative shouldbe...
-5- V 231be followed.The dileMia(Will be seen to offer two alternatives   the first involving creaking the armistice and renewing the war &apos;thesecond involving&apos; negotiations for the revision of tie Treaty!    Such negotiations would be commenced at a disadvantage in consequence ofa.   ihe strength of the Nationalist organisation.o.   ihe successes already achieved by  ustapha Kemal.c.   1ng difficulty of going on with the disarmament of Turkey.GoVithe...........the endangerment of Constantinople.In response to these representations the French Government.announce that they recognise the necessity for defending the Ismid Peninsula an and for the closest allied co-operation in Turkey.They object to the intermingling of Frenchj Italian and British troops as difficult, on,the grounds&quot;of command and supplies, and^suggment is suggested as France has already agreed to General Milne&apos;s command in asia Minor and it is considered right, and has been repeat-edly proposed by the French Government, that the command in European Turkey should be French. &quot;     *Having considered, these proposals our military authorities Point out the necessity of unity of command in the operations now being s-onducted against the Turks ana which may involve both the north &quot;and south sides of the Straits.    The arbitrary division of the forces engaged into two commands is opposed ,o all principles of strategv and deprives us of the advantages of a central position.    The base of our operations must remain Constantinople and this precludes the work-of the French proposal.    In the event of a general attack and possibly a rising in Constantinople nothing could be worse than the existence of two commands in such a small zone.    There might even be three as the Italians might claim a separate command also.&apos;It is therefore impossible to agree to abandon unity of command and the only ouestion is whether the command should be British or French,      ihe whole burden of the Turkish war was borne by Great Britain and the majority of the troops in the area concerned are still British-,    We agreed to a French C-ih-C on the Western Front and at Salonica and worked loyally under those arrangements.    It seems there fore only reasonable that France should agree to a British C-in-C for the present operations.    It would be unfortunate to have to explain in Parliament that unity of command always means that British troops are placed under French command and never means that French or Italian troops are placed under British command.&quot;    Should the French agree to a British C-in-C it is proposed to consult them in the selection of the Officer.The High Commissioner^ view  is that to accept the French proposal that they should command in Constantinople is to sacrifice our&apos; predominant position there as . the Power which defeated Turkey, made the armistice and executed the recent occupation of the city&quot;. Further it involves handing over the only possible base for operations in the Turkish area and for influencing the    -Sultan and the Turkish Cabinet.    fie are the only Power determined to execute the Treaty whereas the French have been in communication with Mustapha Kemal, have made an armistice with him and may at any time decide that a policy of compromise with him. accords best wit i their interests.   By controlling Constantinople they could facilitate tie creation of a nationalist Government and so render execution of the Treaty impossibleIt may be further noted that the French forces are at present insufficient In number (and in Quality) for the defence of Constantinople and the defence of the&apos;Chataldia lines and would have to Be reinforced by British and Greek troops from Asia Minor.    The Greek troops have accepted British, but not French command, anda Constantinople must be&quot;the base for their operations in the Ismid &quot;^nin^ula

The Italian Government has been asked to co-operate in- -     - _______ _____...... ______anOfficers to the Nationalist leaders in Anatolia are so openly directed against the allies that the presence of Italian troops in the Ismid area might involve the transmission of intelligence to the enemy.French officers have also undoubtedly been in relationship with the Nationalists and have worked against us.    The attitude of the French authorities is however loyal and correct.The High Commissioner urges that the French and Italian Governments should forthwith give categorical orders for the withdrawal of officers and agents from areas under Nationalist control, and the F.O. has reouested our ambassadors at Paris and Home to make representations accordingly.Feisal is seriously concerned as to the results of the Armistice concluded with Mustapha Kemal by   General Gouraud and followed by a considerable French retirement.    He feels this having occurred before the Turkish Treaty has even been ratified may menace the neace and lead to a series of defeats in the Near East in which all the Allies may bo involved.    In this way the Turkish desire to extend their domination south would be strengthened and their influence become overwhelming.   In view of Feisalfs reported visit to Aleppo to meet Mustafa Kemal1 s emissaries and of his distrust of French&apos;intentions it is thought that a possibility of his joining hands with the Nationalises exists.A report from Constantinople credits the Grand Vizier with having -made an attempt last month to enter into an agreement with Greece on the following linesa. A defensive alliance for the mutual protection of their Thracian territories against Bulgaria.b. Turkey to retain&quot;adrianople and a corridor connecting it with thebetween Rodosto and Silivri, c.   Large commercial concessions in return for a Greek withdrawal.The report states that the Greek High Commissioner agreed to transmit these proposals to his Government.    It appears improbable that Greece will surrender any of the advantages she has gained.Reschid Bey and Djemal Pasha returned   to  Cons tan tmonle from Paris on the 17tn instant bringing the views of the Peace Delegation on the Treaty for consideration by the Government.    On the 19th the Porte reouested an extension of 15 days from the 26th in view of these two delegates being unable to return to Paris with the Cabinet&apos;s views by the date.In an interview with the Jligh Commissioner Reschid and Djemal took the line that the extension of time would certainly be granted and also expressed the hope that Turkish objections to the Treaty would be considered indulgently.    It was pointed out that the recent proceedings in Ismid were likely to have a&quot;cooling effect on any sympathy entertained for Turkey and that observers at a distance mirfit find it difficult to discriminate between the Ottoman Govern-merit and the Nationalists, who were operating in Paris as well as in Asia l-inor, making every effort to persuade--Allied opinion that Mustanha Kemal alone represents Turkey.    In&quot; renly the two delegates duly denounced the Nationalists withfervour and said the future stability of Turkey could only be assured by placing her under the aegis of a single Power, this1 country being, of course, the only one nullified, .
004  &apos; Ji Since his return to Constantinople, Beschid has beeiL-on^girig-&apos;r i-n intrigue against the Grand Vizier and it is knowrf for some &quot;time jpast ho has been gravitating towards the Nationalists, whose aim is to caoture the &quot;peace delegation, reduce Damad Feria to nullity and force, bis resignation.    The French have a hand in this game and would, like to see tfeschid, who is on intimate terms with them, 1 in Perid&apos;s place.    In order to be quit of him as a source of danger C-in-C, Mediterranean, offered tho two delegates passage to Taranto in OARADOC on the 26tb instant.

Nationalists were reported active in the &quot;unguldak area, at present occupied by French troops, and were showing &apos; hostility to the British all along the Marmora shore and had become much more truculent.    Similarly In the Dardanelles area insolent messages have been received demanding the release of certain Nationalists, recently arrested, failing which, reprisals were j threatened in the future against any British landing at Bigha.j8.6.20.       On this date C-in-C, Mediterranean, reported Ismid was still held but that the railway.to Haidar Pasha was unsafe as no British troops were available to guard it.     All the South Coa^t of the ; Sea of Marmora was in Nationalist hands and the ^siatir side oftho Dardanelles was open to them, with the exception of Chanak, Lapsaki being already in their hands.    Nationalist objectives were * assumed to be the occupation of   Scutari and the Asiatic side of the Straits.The French had been asked to send aeroplanes to Gallipoli, no British machines being available and admiral de Robeck had offered General Milne 2000 men from the Fleet for service in Constantinople and 700 for the Dardanelles area.    As the French were understood to have undertaken the guarding of the Gallipoli peninsula and the Chataldja Lines it was assumed&quot;&apos;that they could spare no men for the danger point - the Ismid Peninsula.&quot;By this time all Italian warships, with the exception of one T.B.D, and the Depot and W/T ship had left Constantinople,I The important factor at this date was the armistice betweenthe French and imstapha Kemal, which set free certain Nationalist forces to act against the other Allies.    The Nationalist leaders did not, at the moment, consider the Smyrna front as of importance in view of the Supreme Council&apos;s consent being necessary before an advance could, take place.- 0.6.20.

All guns on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles were reported destroyed, the operation being carried out by the following ships under R,A, Doughty:- RESOLUTION, ROYAL OAK, GERES, VIDETTE, SOOME.25.6.20.        General Zymbrakakis informed General Milne that so far he had received no orders to embark the Division placed under his orders.; General Milne, who had sent some ships for&quot;this purpose requested j that M.

-Newswas received in Const ant inoxae on June 22nd attained a period of comparative quiet, fixating ^ reeur.od a few days previously on a more extensive scale than fomerly.   French warships were bombarding the Nationalist forces,which in turn were shelling Mersina and the warships.     700 Armenian orphans from Morsina  were, embarked onboard the Italian s.s. Tirol, and reached Limassol, Cyprus, on June 21st.With regard to the safety of the Armenians in cilicia H.M. Embassy in Paris was inferred on June 18th that recent news was of a re-assuring nature- the French being encamped near Aintab and capable of intervening in the event of danger to the Christian population there.     In the meantime 3,600 Armenians had been evacuated to Killis, whence they nay return in due oourse to Aintab, or proceed if they prefer it, to the now Armenian republic in the Caucasus.     Assurances were sought for from ^ustapha ftemal as to the safety of those left behind, but it is. not clear whether these were forthcoming.    However it is understood that a number of them have arms, and that some French officers were loft behind to afford them assistance.The French authorities surest that their difficulties have been much increased &quot;by the action .of the Armenians themselves, who are said to have lost no opportunity of massacring isolated Turks.).fIS0HrLLAN2QTJS   HOME   IHPI31LLlGi5IJD5.There has been considerable comment in the Portsmouth local press over the fact that shipbreakers have been asked to       / tender for 8 obsolete vessels lying in the Yard.
