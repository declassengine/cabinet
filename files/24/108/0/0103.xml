This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.IFIDENTIAL3THE CABINET.WITHDRAWAL FROM MESHED.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I must draw the attention of the Cabinet to the fact that, although six months have passed since the Cabinet came to a definite decision to order a withdrawal from Meshed, no troops have yet left. The two million pounds taken in the Army Estimates on account of this force, over which we have no control, have already been far exceeded, and the Secretary of State for India has informed me that at least another two millions will be needed. A factor like this destroys at a stroke the fruits of many minor laborious War Office economies, and really makes the task of defending War Office Estimates extremely difficult. Parliament has not yet been told that a large Supplementary will be required for the Army in consequence of the delay in curtailing and contracting our responsibilities in the Middle East.I subjoin minutes which show how the matter stands.W. S, C.The Wae Office, 9th July, 1920.APPENDIX.(i.)D.M.O.,Let me have a report showing the exact position to date of the Meshed Mission. How many of the troops have been actually withdrawn ? Let me have a map showing the position both at Meshed and on the lines of communication. What is the time-table for withdrawal.6th July, 1920.w. s. c.(ii.)D.M.O.,1. Reference Secretary of State&apos;s query : x A. No troops have at present been withdrawn.B. Map attached. C. Time table not received.2. This withdrawal is being carried out under orders from India. Please see telegram &quot; X &quot; and &quot; Y &quot; attached.3. The India Office was asked unofficially to find out the situation and they replied that India was doing her best and would keep us informed, as promised.4. India Office have since received a- wire stating that Meshed were awaiting a reply re disposal of stores. India Office have replied to this that there is no reason to await a reply as the withdrawal is timed to take so long that the troops can commence to withdraw before the stores question is settled. We have not yet received the official correspondence referring to this./&apos; (iii.)

Meshed canriot begin until early in July. By the time that Bolsheviks on Enzeli front ( become aware that withdrawal from Meshed is in progress, Enzeli situation may have been satisfactorily settled. On the other hand, if after another month Enzeli situation has become increasingly serious, this in our opinion will of itself constitute additional and weighty reason for withdrawal of Meshed Force with least possible delay before it becomes involved locally. The smallness of Meshed Force and the length and vulnerability of lines of communication render it a tempting bait to Afghan aggression, and its maintenance is draining us dry of transport which may be urgently required elsewhere and cannot be replaced from India.&apos;We are therefore reluctantly compelled strongly to oppose Cox&apos;s suggestion to retain force at Meshed for even a day after commencement of withdrawal becomes practicable.Repeated to Teheran and Meshed.(iv.) &apos;   &quot;[Copy of telegram Y. J From Viceroy to Secretary of State for India.Handed in 2nd June, 1920.(No. 6917.) (Received 3rd, 6 p.m.)Your telegram No. Nil of 5th May re withdrawal of Meshed force. We presume that mission and consular escort at Meshed will be maintained from Teheran after force has been withdrawn as was case in pre-war days.2. Alternative line of maintenance from Duzdap is so unreliable that we deprecate its use, and we could not undertake maintenance of escort unless road is kept in constant state of repair, is adequately protected and posts provided at regular intervals for protection of convoys en route. We propose, moreover, that ultimately the escort at Meshed should be found from the Indian troops which we furnish for the post-war garrison in Mesopotamia.3. We will arrange to furnish and maintain consular escort in Seistan.4. Arrangements for withdrawal are in progress, but no move can take place until water arrangements are complete.   You Will be kept acquainted with situation.Repeated to Minister, Teheran, and Malmiss.
