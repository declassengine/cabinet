They have examined the\ building programmes undertaken by the Office of Works for the PcWfc Office, The Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Pensions, Treasury, Ministry of Health and other departments.   In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet 28 ( 0) Minute 5, they have also reviewed the buildings on the estimates of the Admiralty,,-War Offioe*and Air Ministry.It appeared at an early stage in the Committeefs discussions that the Building Programmes of the various Departments had already been drastically cut down both on financial grounds and in order to meet the requirements of the Ministry of Health for housing.   The opportunity for further curtailment was therefore limited.   The4Committee have recommended the postponement of the buildings set out in the Appendix to Jhis report.   In consequence of this post-ponement it has been possible to make a saving at the moment of -approximately 700 bricklayers, 310 carpenters and 756 men employedin other skilled trades.   By far the greater part of the saving &quot;has been^made by the postponement of buildings which are very urgently required by the Post Office for the improvement of t e&apos; telephone system - an improvement, already overdue before the war, the necessity for which to-day is too well-known to require comment hei Out of the above totals 283 bricklayers, 138 carpenters and 44 *ther skilled trades have been saved on the Post Office Programme -for telephone exchanges and other Post Office buildings.
many of which in any case would not have been commenced for some time. The Ministry of Labour at the suggestion of the Committee have reconsidered their building programme, and have made drastic reductions. In their revised ,scheme temporary hutments have, been substituted for permanent buildings in every case save one. By the substituted scheme the following reduction has been made in the amount af skilled labour to be employed :- 

Bricklayers 166 carpenters  83. Other skilled trades  218

In order to secure this reduction it has been nessary to postpone several buildings which are urgently required either for the convenience of the public or the health and welfare of Government servants and it is a question for consideration whether such postponement is really justifiable in view of the very small addition that it will give to the number of skilled labourers required by the Ministry of Health. for housing.

The shortage of cricklayers and carpenters required for housing in Great Britain at the present time is nearly 7,000 bricklayers and 4,000 carpenters.     It is obvious that the postponements ordered by the Committee will make no appreciable difference in this amount.

As I have already explained in my Memorandum to the Cabinet (C.P.1348) I have come to the conclusion that the only solution of of the problem presented by the shortage of skilled labour in the building trade is the adoption of a system of dilution, but as this matter will be under review by the recently appointed Cabinet Committee on Housing (Cabinet 36 (20) Conclusion 2) it is unnecessary to consider it in this report beyond stating that my Committee are unanimous in the opinion that no real progress can be made
with housing until the building trade is prepared to agree to the admission of new labour on a very large scale andto encourage a much higher rate of output.(Initialled) I.7/.E.XEngland &amp; Wales ScotlandBrj-cklayers, 4804&apos;&quot;&apos; 125Carpenters?
