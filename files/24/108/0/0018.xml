Cabinet to consider&apos; -whether any steps could be taken to relieve &quot;exceptional cases of hardship among pre-war&apos; pensioners due, for example,, to age and infirmity-.&apos;&quot;The Bill provides-in Clause I for the payment of increased rates of pension to Government pensioners and&apos; in Clause 3 for the grant of;corresponding benefits to pensioners&apos;In-&apos; receipt of pensions payable by any Police, Looal or other, public authority.    - -.-- Navy and irmy&apos; pensioners will be dealt-with bv Order in : Council and hoyal Warrant respectively- in&apos;accordance-with normal constitutional practice.&apos;  It will, however, be     ... observed that provision is made in the- Bill for the&apos; applica-titn to these pensioners1 of the prescribed.penalty for &apos;false statements,&apos;, etc.The Cabinet Committee recommended that&apos; in order to-qualify for relief a; pre-war&apos; pensioner&apos; should have beenpensioned on retirement for age or have corn;leted&apos;the termof service required- to earn a full- service pension or:&quot;have ; - :   .been invalided out of the- -ervice before complction of that term; and- that he should be 60 years of age or over unless&apos; he had: been invalided- out of the cervice.   jrtiis recommendatdon has been carried into Clause 2 of the&apos;Bill with the omission: of any reference to the completion of a full term of service,. This slight modification is. desirable partly-because- of the difficulty of determining in certain eases what: &quot;constitutes &apos; - a full term of service and partly in order that the benefits of the Bill may apply to.cases of persons- discharged to pension on abolition of Office&apos;&quot;,&apos;&apos;The
The  ill will apply primarily to pre-war pensioners but&apos; its benefits will extend also to persona discharged to pension since, the outbreak of war who would otherwise , be receiving lest than the pre-war pensioner whfrse pension is increased under the provisions of the ,*ot.The Cabinet Committee was averse from making any stipulation that a pre-war pension as increased under the Act should not exceed a pension which would be payable at the present time in respect of corresponding service.     It is clear that In the groat bulk of cases to be dealt withthe&apos; pension as increased under the &amp;ot will still be lessthan the pension which, would now be awarded in&apos;respect of corresponding service.   There are, however, a few cases inwhich the increase under the *j.et would result in thepre-war pensioner getting more than the poet war pensioner, and It has been represented that in such cases it will benecessary either to prescribe that a pension as Increased*under the not shall not exceed&apos; the amount of corresponding pension granted in accordance with the present day scale or to revise the present day scale,   On the whole I consider that a provision to give effect to the first of these alternatives might fairly be embodied In the Bill,The Cabinet committee suggested that the- system of calculating means for the purpose of Old Age Pensions  . should so far as possible be adopted and that in particular lump sum grants made on retirement should be treated as capital on the lines laid down for Old ,-.ge 1&apos;ensions.   ,*fter careful consideration the Treasury propose that applicants for increased pension should fill up a declaration on the lines of tin.- attached form, which is a &apos; good deal simpler than the form which would have to be adopted if Old ,-ge Pensions&apos; procedure were strictlyapplied.
