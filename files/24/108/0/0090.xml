SUMMARY.TURKEY.The connection of the Turkish Nationalists who attacked British troops on the Ismid Peninsula with the Bolsheviks is demonstrated in the account of a secret alliance held in the Moscow Foreign Office at the end of May. Leading Bolshevik commissars and representatives from Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and India were present. The parties agreed to help each other with officers, troops, arms and money.Direct touch has been established between the Emir Feisul and Mustapha Kemal Pasha, and a defensive alliance between them has been signed. Arms and supplies are reported to come to the Nationalists from Italy, and in April Turkish Nationalists were,, purchasing American uniforms, hospital stores, &amp;c, which were being sold by the French Government at Basle.ITALY.Italian disappointment is finding expression in revolutionary intrigues against her Allies of the Entente in Central Europe, in Asia Minor, in Egypt, and even so far afield as India.GERMANY.Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin, has been recalled on account of his failure to secure more than two Communist seats in the newly elected Reichstag. He was approached in May by Ludendorff with regard to an alliance between reactionary Germany and Soviet Russia against Poland aud the Entente. He, like Radek six months ago, refused to allow Soviet Russia to be used as a catspaw.The Hamburg Opposition group of the Communist party, which stands for the so-called &quot;National &quot; Bolshevism of revenge, has been in conference with the reactionaries.HOLLAND.There is now positive evidence that the closing down of the Third International Bureau at Amsterdam, announced by Moscow wireless, has not actually taken place, and that Wynkoop, Rutgers and Roland Hoist will continue their activities underground.DENMARK.The Danish Government have absolute proof that Litvinoff, the Soviet Governments representative for Foreign Affairs, has been implicated in Bolshevik intrigue and propaganda in Denmark. It is probable that the elaborate plan for the transfer to Stockholm of the Soviet diplomatic centre abroad really originates in LitvinofFs personal uneasiness.EGYPT.The programme of the Egyptian Nationalist delegation now in London under the leadership of Saad Pasha Zaghlul includes independence for Egypt and the evacuation of the Sudan by Great Britain, and will not consent to lease Alexandria to Great Britain as a naval base. The locality of depots of rifles and other firearms is given.FRANCE.A general revolutionary movement throughout Europe early in July is anticipated by the C.G.T. Russian money brought into France for the use of Degott, the Bolshevik envoy, was distributed during the recent labour disturbances.The Federation des Fonctionnaires (Civil Servants) haB decided to join the C.G.T. French extremist leaders consider that its adhesion is more to embarrass the Government than to unite with industrial labour.A 2
FINLAND.......There has been a split in the Social Democratic party in Finland, tho left dissidents forming a party which they have called the Finnish Socialist Labour party, which adheres to the Third International, minus the army of the Proletariat. Its leaders, Sulo Vuolijoki and Pekkala were arrested by the Finnish authorities.ESTHONIA.Offers of business made to Grukowsky, the Bolshevik trade representa-tive at Reval, rarely became contracts owing to the high prices demanded for manufactured goods. Gukowsky is now reported to have been recalled. *AUSTRIA.The reorganisation of the Army, completed in April, was a complete victory for the Left Socialists, due partly to the indifference .of the Christian Socialist peasants and partly to the anxiety of non-Socialist Ministers about the stability of the Government.POLAND.Discipline in the Polish Army, a loose amalgam of German, Austrian and Russian Poles, is reported not to be good. The success of Communist propaganda among the troops is, however, unlikely, unless the,military situation becomes definitely unfavourable.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.The situation created by the Polish-Hungarian Secret Alliance against the Czecho-Slovaks is leading to reprisals on their.part. The Communist parties in Bohemia and Moravia are working for a revolution.SPAIN.The continual strikes accompanied by rioting and assassination are at present most apparent in the agricultural provinces. In Andalusia, Granada and Cordova, labourers are disaffected, and difficulties from harvesting have already begun.GREECE.Stories of prospective co-operation between the Socialists and the Royalists against M. Venizelos&apos; Anglophile Liberal party are in the air.BELGIUM.The Garde Civique is being reorganised as&quot; a precaution against the possibility of serious labour disturbances.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Public opinion is for law, order and evolution as a safe process for industrial reform and for a firm suppression of all social treasons. There is no change of policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Government. The admiuis-tration is opposed to re-opening trade relations with Russia at present. Eighty-five per cent, of the Communists in America would come over to the Communist Labour party except for the predilection of that body for underground work, which Americans prefer to leave to foreigners^SOUTH AMERICA.An International Convention, whereby the police authorities of j Argentine, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay,- Peru, and Uruguay undertake to furnish each other with information concerning dangerous individuals,-was signed.ad referendum by representatives of the Governments named, in Buenos Aires.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Preparations  or an International Revolutionary Movement.A general revolutionary movement is anticipated throughout Europe early in July by the Confederation Generale du Travail. The French extremists are making their preparations for internal troubles to break out in France at the end of&quot; June, and by the 10th July, if their arrange-ments held good, revolutionary risings should be in progress in England, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Spain. The French leaders know that they themselves have no hope of success after the the recent fiasco after the first of May celebrations, but they count on being able to give an impetus to risings in other countries. According to letters received by the C.G.T. in Paris, there will be a successful rising in Germany after the elections, and also in Italy. The Eailwaymen&apos;s Federation has also asked its members to hold themselves in readiness for a new struggle; they hope to appeal for a new strike in about six weeks, in support of an international syndicalist movement.The Communist party at Geneva has received a letter from Loriot pointing out that the first of May demonstrations and the subsequent strikes were entirely spoilt by Government counter-measures; the Federation. Sooialiste-Communiste had made preparations for important events, but the authorities were aware of them and prevented their being put into execution. Loriot assures the Geneva Communist party that the minority section of the C.G.T. grouped round &quot; La Yie Ouvriere&quot; proposes to transform itself into a movement for absolute revolution, which he thinks will have good chances of success as. soon as the left wing of the Socialist party in France can be got to join the new group.It has now been definitely ascertained that the Russian money brought into France for the use of Degott* was distributed during the recent labour disturbances. Degott first came to France in 1908 with his family ; he left in 1917 and was away until his secret return last month. He was sent to. France as a forerunner of Krassin, but there is little likelihood of the latter being allowed to enter France. Well-informed Russians in Paris consider that France is changing her attitude towards Russia and is now inclined to support General WYangel. At the houses ,of Monatte, Sirolle^ Legrand, Monmousseau, and Souvarine have been found memoranda and correspondence from Lenin, Trotsky, Sadoul, Krassin, Litvinoff, and Henri Guilbeaux, all sent from Moscow.* For Degott, see Report No, 19 (Way 1920) p. 60.
In the case of Paul Vaillant-Couturier, Parliamentary immunity will he raised, and he will be prosecuted at the instigation of M. Leon Daudet and kindred politicians, M. Millerand, it is understood, being opposed to such action.The F6d6ration des Fonctionnaiies and the C.G.T.The Federation des Fonctionnaires (Civil Servants) decided on 27th May to join the C.G.T. This decision was only reached after a debate lasting two days, during which considerable opposition to the proposal was shown. Among the teachers this opposition came from the higher grades, while among the minor postal officials a large number were so strongly opposed to joining with the C.G.T. as to consider the advisability of seceding entirely from the Federation des Fonctionnaires. It will be remembered that in December last the School Teachers1 Friendly Societies decided to transform themselves into trades unions and become affiliated to C.G.T., and now that the civil servants, with a membership of 200,000 persons, the majority of whom are also teachers, have taken the same step, another large body of teachers join the ranks of organised labour. The Government has decided that the C.G.T. has committed a breach of the law in accepting the affiliation of the civil servants organisations. French extremist leaders are said to attach little importance to the adhesion of the &quot; Fonctionnaires&quot; to the C.G.T. considering that these people have been driven to take this step by the neglect of the Government to remedy their grievances, and that their adhesion is actuated more by a desire to embarrass the Government than really to unite with industrial labour.The Association Republicaine des Anciens Combattants and Le Groupe Clarte\The Executive Committee of the Association Republicaine des Anciens Combattants and Le Groupe Clarte, after consultation with their branches in other countries, have drawn up a charter undertaking to refuse to take up arms against one another in the event of any war, and to do everything possible to prevent such war by promoting a general strike in their respective countries. The following are believed to have signed this undertaking : Henri Barbusse       - - - - - France.Karl Tiedt      -      - - - - - Germany.A. E. Mander -      - - &apos; - - - England,Jean H. M. van Treel - - - - Belgium.Vincenzo Pagella     - - - - Italy.The Congress of the International Labour Organisation.Judicial proceedings were begun on 5th June against the C.G.T., but at the request of M. Jouhaux the enquiry was postponed for a fortnight in order that he might attend the meeting of the Labour Bureau of the League of Nations at Genoa.At the Congress of the International Labour organisation instituted by the Treaty of Versailles,&quot; meeting at Genoa on 15th June, France will be represented by Arthur Fontaine, Giraud of the Merchant Seamen&apos;8 Society, Rio, Deputy in the Chamber for La Loire Inferieure, and a number of technical delegates. M. Millerand refused the request of Albert Thomas that Grunebanm Ballin should be included as a delegate. Jouhaux and Rivelli, the former representing the Conseil d&apos;Administration de rOffice International du Travail, and the latter the French Merchant Seam en&apos;s Federation, will be present.
The Boycotting of Hungary.The Confederation General du Travail and the Federation Syndicalo Internationale have been holding public meetings and issuing manifestoes&apos; in protest against the White Terror in Hungary.Resolutions have been passed in favour of &amp; complete boycott of that country in order to force the Hungarian Government to cease its reign of terror and to punish it for its crimes. On 20th June the French dockers and railway workers were to refuse to handle merchandise destined for Hungary. The decision has been approved by the English Labour party.BELGIUM.The growth of popular hostility to the Socialist programme is shown by the fact that the Minister of the Interior has decided to reorganise the &quot; Garde Civique,&quot; ostensibly in compliance with an existing law, but in reality as a precaution against the possibility of serious labour disturb-ances.Apart from a certain amount of propaganda carried on through their official organ, II Ouvrier Communiste, to which Henriette Roland Hoist, the Dutch Extremist, is now a contributor, the activities of the Communist group in Belgium are on the wane by reason of shortage of funds and of competent organisers. Josef Jacquemotte, editor of VExploite and the principal organiser of the Brussels branch of the &quot; Jeunes Gardes Socialistes,&quot; is still pursuing his activities in the mining districts, where his speeches, articles, &amp;c, have had considerable effect.The Congress of the *&apos; Jeunes Garde Socialistes &quot; at Brussels has been postponed in order, according to their own announcement, that a pre-liminary meeting of the district secretaries may be held, but in reality because many branches have failed to pay their affiliation fees for 1920.Bolshevik agents are trying to import arms from Brazil to Belgium via, Holland through Adolfo Hennies, a man born in Brazil and now living with a woman named Lima de Haag at 47, Rue de Leide, Amsterdam. The office for this alleged traffic is said to be at 31, Rue de Palais, Amsterdam.ITALY.General.Italian disappointment with Italy&apos;s share of the spoils of war does not grow less bitter with time, and is finding expression in the inter-national sphere in a transference of her political sympathies from her war-time Allies to her Allies of the Triple Alliance, and internally by repercussion in popular lawlessness and general labour unrest. The signs of her participation in intrigues against her Allies of the Entente in Central Europe, in Asia Minor, in Egypt, and even so far afield as India, are increasing. Her shipments of arms and ammunition to Hungary and Asia Minor are the theme of several reports from independent sources. Her readiness to enter into relations with the Soviet Government may be due. to her desire to placate her own revolutionaries.Dealings with Soviet Russia and the Hungarian Communists.The Italian Government forestalled this country in entering into trade relations with Soviet Russia. Her agreement signed in Copenhagen by Litvinoff and Bombacci, the Italian trade representative, is to be effective for a period of four months. This agreement, to which S. -Nitti&apos;s consent was anticipated by Bombacci, provided that Italy was to supply
soap, cloth, drugs, hoots, and salt to Novorossisk, and in return to receive at the same place, cereals, timber, cotton, and other raw materials from the Russian territories near the Black Sea.A responsible Italian official, who came to London about the time of Krassin&apos;s arrival, arranged to confer quietly with the Soviet representative before the latter&apos;s meeting with Mr. Lloyd George, He seems to have left Krassin with a good impression of Italian amiability and anxiety to please as compared with the British, and indicated that Italy was prepared to resume trade relations immediately, and would admit a Soviet representative as soon as the Soviet authorities cared to appoint one. He waived aside the previous debts and obligations upon which France and Britain were taking a stand, as not in the least binding upon Italy.On 21st May a conference was held at Milan at which there were represented: Federation of Italian Seamen. Syndicate of Italian Railwaymen, General Confederation of Labour. Union of Italian Syndicates. Executive of the Italian Socialist party. Communist Anarchical Union. SerratPs &quot; Avanti.&quot;&quot; Umanita Nuova&quot; (the organ of the Anarchists, edited by Malatesta, who attended the conference in person).The Conference decided to intensify the action of the proletariat for the defence of the Socialist Republic in Russia, and to this end the representatives of the organisations present pledged themselves not to allow arms and ammunition to be transported in Italy and later on to discontinue the production of war material. A week before the Socialist party had held meetings at Trieste and Gorizi, and decided to prevent any supply of war material to Poland or any other country at war with Soviet Russia, and they have since been carrying out their decision, with the result that various supplies, including some from France for Roumania, are already held up. The metal workers have passed a resolution refusiug to make anything to be used against Soviet Russia. There is some soul of goodness in things evil. This action of the extremists will also hold up the consignments of arms and ammunition for Egypt and Turkey.The Italian Socialists, Vella and Delia Seta, returned somewhat prematurely to Italy on the invitation of the Hungarian authorities during the first week in May. They were not allowed to pursue their intention of visiting all the Communist prisoners in Hungary, because they began their visits by inflammatory declarations inciting these prisoners against the Hungarian Government.Anti-British Feeling.. A wave of anti-British feeling is sweeping over Italy again. Practically every newspaper publishes articles daily, predicting the imminent downfall of the British Empire, and gloating over exaggerated troubles in India, Ireland, and Egypt,Public opinion in Italy is at the mercy of the press, and the present anti-British sentiment is the result of systematic propaganda undertaken with the object of weakening Italy&apos;s friendship towards England and reviving her alliance to Germanv.The causes of her present hostility are resentment at Italy&apos;s ill-treatment by England and the Allies, who did not appreciate the fact that she won the war for them,   Jealousy also has its part.  Italy; poor
and without raw materials, without food or energy for reconstruction, is jealous of the rapidity with which G-reat Britain is leaving the war behind. In her opposition to us she also finds consolation for her own troubles in the talk of revolution. It is consoling to the newspapers and to the public that England, the strongest country in the world, also has troubles, and that the British Empire, like the kingdom of Italy, appears to be on the edge of an abyss.Newspapers in Italy do not represent the individual ideas of their proprietors, or even the policy of the party to which they adhere, but the interests, financial or otherwise, of the banks, industrial concerns, or institutions that support them. Newspaper writers can be bought very cheaply, often with as little as 50 or 100 francs, and the ease with which an occasional contributor can get his stuff printed gives further oppor-tunity to the propagandist. Writers, again, often have ulterior motives, and there are some who are now writing against England who do so either in the vain hope of exercising effective blackmail or with the object of getting something they want. A case in point is that of Count Max di Colalto, formerly the Italian centre of intrigue against the British in Egypt, from which he was expelled. He is now trying to get permission to return to Egypt from the British Embassy by writing articles against England in the Boman newspapers, hoping that the Embassy may be impressed and may send him back to Egypt to get rid of him. A certain number of writers are, of course, influenced by real sympathy towards Ireland, India, or Egypt, because they have been approached by friends belonging to these countries who are in t Italy. Thus, Monsignor Bonaiuti befriends the Irish, while other journalists befriend Egyptians or Indians. It may also be surmised without undue cynicism that the present anti-British campaign is the result of the cessation of French expenditure for press propaganda in Italy. Journalists who benefited by French money during the war are now seeking Irish, Egyptian, Indian, Russian&apos;, or German gold. They are probably getting only Italian paper currency, and not much of that.Egypt and Turkish Intrigue.There is the gravest evidence that Italy has become a real centre of Egyptian and Pan-Islamic intrigue, its position rendering it a convenient, post for the despatch of war material and propaganda to Asia Minor and to Egypt via Tripoli. The Egyptian plotters are said to have relations with the Italian Socialists, and persons connected with the Italian Legation at Berne are reported to have countenanced, and even assisted, the intrigue. The plotters in Italy have relations with their colleagues in Switzerland, and there is evidence connecting them both with the Nationalist Committees in Berlin and with the Russian Bolsheviks.When Talaat was in Italy towards the end of April last, he made arrangements with the Italian Government for the assistance of the Turkish Nationalists. Subsequent events show that effect is being given to these arrangements. Turkish affairs are in the hands of the Italian General Staff and the Foreign Office, and the Egyptians are being openly helped by the Peoples&apos; and Radical parties. Arms and munitions are reported to be going to Egypt with the aid of the latter party, and Signor Paratore, Minister for the Colonies, has secured the assistance of officials in Tripoli.   It is a cheap way of placating the Tripolitan Arabs.Apart: from the help they are giving to gun-running, the Italian authorities give every facility to Turkish, Egyptian, Indian, and other Nationalists to carry on their activities in the country, and to pass freely from and to Italy. A number of Turks are given Italian passports, and a letter has been produced showing that the headquarters of the General
Staff arranged for a &quot; permis de sejour &quot; to be given to a hot Nationalist so as to enable him to pursue his avocations in Italy without interference from the police. All anti-British conspirators seem to be welcomed and everything is done to induce them to make Italy one of their principal centres, which indeed they are doing.Among the Italian notables who are active in helping the Turkish and Egyptian causes are Signor Giolitti, General Garibaldi, P. Garibaldi, and the Radical leader, Signor Amandola.Abdul Hamed Said has now become the leader of the Egyptian Nationalists in Italy, and has his headquarters at Naples, where he works in with the Turks. He is chiefly occupied in sending arms to Egypt and Turkey. The arms and ammunition which are being supplied by the Italians to Turkey are ostensibly sent to the Italian Army in Asia Minor. They are actually handed over to the Turkish Nationalists in due course. It is said also to have been arranged iu case of need to use an Italian warship in order to forward the arms to any part desired. General Tarditti, late Governor or Commander in Tripoli, and Captain Tavarrahi have been semi-officially selected by the Italian Government to deal with Oriental questions. The Captain is a member of the Italian General Staff; his mother being an Indian lady and a personal friend of Madame Cama, Chattopadaya, and other Indian revolutionaries.An indication of Italian feeling towards the British Empire in the East is afforded by their treatment of Ahmed Mansour and Mohamed Hamid, two lieutenants in the Egyptian Army, who were court-martialled and sentenced to death in Egypt, but succeeded in escaping to Italy, and have since been in charge of the Italian military authorities at Taranto. Assurances have been given by the War and Foreign Offices to Socialist Deputies that in no case will these officers be extradited and delivered to the British authorities in Egypt.The British Government having recently brought pressure to bear on the Germans to expel Egyptian and Hindoo organisations, Dato, President of the Hindoo Club in Berlin, and Talaat Pasha have gone to Milan through Switzerland. Authority to remain there has been obtained for them from the Italian Government by the Italian Socialists.Conference of Oppressed Peoples.The Conference of Oppressed Peoples and Nations which was to take place at Fiume is to be attended only by well known and thoroughly trustworthy National revolutionaries. The Conference itself has been postponed, but certain meetings between the Nationalists of the countries engaged in the intrigues have taken place. At one such meeting in Rome on the 27th May, which was held at the Grand Hotel in the room of the Mr. 0&apos;Kelly who, it will be remembered, was sent from Paris as a result of D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s mission, the following were present: The Italian delegates were entirely agreed that the Government of Nitti could not survive much longer, and that the reins of office would fall into the bauds of Giolitti. Strenuous efforts were being made in this direction. The discussion turned on the attitude that would be taken by the British Colonies and especially by Egypt, Ireland, and India, and itGeneral TardittiP. Garibaldi Signor Costa Mr. 0&apos;Kelly Mr. 0&apos;Brien -Abdul Wahid- y Italian.Dr. Hamid Said   -&quot; x Irish.- Indian.- Egyptian.
was considered what help it would be possible for the new Italian Government to give. General Tar$itti said that he felt very confident that a secret alliance could be made with the Russian Soviet using Ireland, Egypt, aud India as intermediaries. He did not wish to deal direct with the Soviet through the Italian official Socialists owing to certain internal political reasons. The Indian delegate promised to render assistance and so the matter ended.Social and Industrial Unrest.The past month has been marked by a series of disorders throughout Italy, which, though not singly of great importance, when taken together are significant of the general instability of the country.A Red insurrection broke out on 19th May in Carnia. In about 50 communes Soviet Councils were proclaimed aud red flags were hoisted on the city halls. The Communists took advantage of the ill-will towards the Italian Government among the rural population in the Redenta province, which has been described in previous reports. The peasant population, whose homes had been destroyed in the war and who have found their occupation gone, were incited to insurrection by extremist agitators from Milan. The Government at once sent troops, police, and carabineri, who restored order. As a protest against the peasants&apos; treat-ment by the Government, however, a general strike in which the railways joined was proclaimed throughout Carnia and the Friuli province, and even as far as Verona, where tramwaymen, metal workers, electricians, and in fact workmen in general, including printers and municipal clerks and employees, stopped work. ,In Italy, however, there is often a great flare from small fuel, and some of the strikes which make some figure in the newspapers are merely riotous episodes. Of this kind was the May Day disturbance at Viareggio. After a football match, where the people were very much excited, there was a fight. The police, as usual, jumped to the conclusion that it was a pretext for and prelude to a revolution. When the fight was over and the excitement had calmed down, a zealous &quot; carbiniere &quot; in a secluded spot shot the referee. The people became indignant. They mobbed the police and the carbinieri (who sought safety in flight), proclaimed a general strike, and decided not to resume work until the &quot; victim &quot; had been appropriately buried. The Socialists hoisted the Red Flag over the Labour Union and proclaimed a Soviet. As was to be expected, the local authorities completely lost their heads. There were hardly any troops at Viareggio with the exception of a score or two of artillerymen in charge of a gun range, who naturally gave up the arms and ammunition in their charge.The rifles taken from these soldiers, and others from a detachment of fifty infantrymen who were sent from Leghorn to restore order (and who were mobbed, disarmed, and taken to the wine shops, where they were fed and refreshed at the public expense), were used by the young men and boys of the town to shoot birds in the neighbouring pine forest. Their vassiduous firing day and night alarmed the neighbouring districts during the three days that the town was isolated. Finally, the authorities decided to take energetic action. Battleships and other war vessels were sent to Viareggio. Troops surrounded the city. Two generals, accompanied by the local Socialist M.P., entered the town to negotiate its surrender. They were mobbed and would have been roughly handled had they not promised to take no action before the victim&apos;s burial. When this took place everything was over and the troops entered the town cheered by the people, while the men-of-war steamed away.
As the report that Viareggio had joined the Soviet Republic spread in the neighbourhood, sundry strike? encouraged by the Anarchists and Socialists were proclaimed at Leghorn and elsewhere, while the railway men stopped all trains conveying troops to Viareggio, and insisted that they should march there.SPAIN.Revolutionary Disturbances.Germany was reported towards the middle of May to be fostering serious disturbances in Spain for the month of July. The recent Syndicalist disturbances are regarded as having been a trial of strength in preparation for the great movement which is generally expected in that month. Felix Graupeera, late President of the Federation Patronal, is in German pay and in possession of funds which he is using to stir up trouble between capital and labour. During the , second week in May a messenger from the German Government arrived in Barcelona and was to return to Berlin to make final preparations for the upheaval.Syndicalists.Violent disorder is not confined to Barcelona which, along with Valencia, is still reported as the centre of revolutionary activity, but is described as general throughout the country, especially in places east of a line from run to Gibraltar. Strikes are continual and are accompanied by rioting and assassination.The effect of the storm is, for the moment, most apparent in the agricultural provinces. In Andalusia, Granada and Cordoba the agricul-tural labourers are disaffected, and difficulties over harvesting have already begun. If the harvest, which is unusually abundant this year, were even partially lost owing to a general strike in these provinces, the situation would become serious over the whole country.The new Minister of the Interior, Bergamin, is not only very weak, but is said to be practically in league with the Syndicalists, who are said to be much encouraged by his passivity, while the officials who are really trying to enforce strong measures against disturbers of the peace are correspondingly depressed. Bergamin was responsible for the resignation of Duran, Governor of Valencia, a man who had pleased everybody except the Syndicalists.The police in Barcelona are working hard and energetically, as far as their limited powers go. Careful watch is kept on the Syndicalists, and as soon as a secret meeting place is discovered it is raided.&apos; This is certainly having a very disturbing effect on the Syndicalist organisations ; for example, the Syndicate of Water, Gas, and Electric Works has fallen to pieces owing to the arrest of its leaders, and has not yet been re-formed. It is now almost certain that Pestana and Segui haVe never left Spain, but are still in hidiug in Barcelona. Terrorism is.still so rife, however, that judges and juries do not sentence oven murderers to more than long terms of imprisonment which, if the criminal is a Syndicalist, are invariably reduced on some pretext to a few months.A bread strike in Madrid on 20th May caused great hardship. It-was called in support of the biscuit makers, who had been on strike for some time, but it was&apos; quite evident that revolutionary tendencies were also at work : Marino Garcia, the Syndicalist leader, stating at a meeting that the way to advance the revolutionary cause was for the strikers to make exorbitant demands. The strike having set fire to the train, a number of further explosions took place in various places, notably at Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville, where the release of imprisoned Syndicalist leaders-was demanded. t
PORTUGAL.High Cost o! Living.Revolutionary unrest in Portugal, should it become serious, will, it is stated, be due solely to economic. factors. In the meantime social and industrial disquiet is reported to have decreased considerably owing to the firm action of the government supported by all but an infinitesimal minority of extremists. Spanish unrest affects Portugal very little. The fact that the Spaniard does one thing is almost enough to make the Portuguese do another. Even common Socialist or Revolutionary aims lose their force under this national antagonism, and Spain is described as forming a buffer state against the waves of Bolshevism or Extreme Socialism, which might otherwise invade Portugal from the East. German activities are said also to be on the wane, no revival of them being anticipated until the German official representatives are re-established in.the country. Portugal therefore appears to be immune as regards external influences. On the other hand, the economic situation is rapidly becoming serious and the prevalent high prices may lead to local, disturbances. The necessaries of life are rising . in cost as they detoriate in quality. . Bread is said to be all but uneatable, and butter and sugar practically unobtainable.The bread strike ended by a compromise, the Government being prepared to examine the question of the socialisation of the industry and to consider the question of an eight-hour day. The case of workers at the biscuit factory from which the strike originated is to be the subject of arbitration by the authorities. The workmen thus give up their demand that all employees of the factory must be members of the Union, the most important point in dispute. A. beginning of strike weariness is in fact becoming apparent among workers generally, who are finding that strikes while achieving little, inconvenience them and their families as much as the public.Italian port workers have come to a resolution to boycott Spanish goods as an international protest against the detention of Syndicalist prisoners in Spain. It is said that during his visit to Italy, carbohydrates arranged this personally with Malatesta. France and Portugal are reported to have agreed to do the same, though it is doubtful whether the dockers in the latter country will adhere to the agreement.Communists. ,Information was received late in April that arms for the use of Spanish Communists were being shipped on Spanish and Norwegian boats. The Spanish Bolsheviks have proposed to the International Bureau at Amsterdam that a Communist Congress should be held this year in Spain. Invitations have already gone to the United States, France, and Italy. Lamoneda delares that he has great.hopes of the success of this congress and privately expects that America will pay the piper.   The Bureau Internationale have invited the following : France - Rappaport, Lefebvre, Loriot.Germany - Legien, Schweizer.Holland - David Wynkoop, Roland Hoist,Norway - Shefio.England - Sylvia Pankhurst, McLean, A. Inkpin.Italy - - Jacinto Menolti Serrati, Amadeo Bordiga.Russia - Radek, Zinovieff or Borodin.
Emigration.Under the circumstances it is scarcely astonishing to find that the increased inclination to emigrate, which has been evident since 1901, has now greatly increased and is causing the Government anxiety. Since the Armistice the figures have increased so rapidly that the authorities are considering restrictive legislation. Portugal has lost no less than 768,538 inhabitants by emigration since 1901. Whole families have left or are leaving. At least one third of the good agricultural land is lying fallow from lack of labour. Meanwhile from the Azores come private advices to the effect that the exodus to the. United States is assuming serious proportions.PoliticalPolitically there has been redistribution of parties. At present the army, the greater part of the Republican Guard and the Artillery in the forts surrounding Lisbon, are on the side of the Government and the Chief of the Staff of the Republican Guard, while the Opposition Group consists of the Navy, the Fiscal Guard, a small portion of the Republican Guard, the Socialists and the leaders of the extreme Left. The existing Government is not inclined to grant an amnesty to political prisoners, a course which it considers dangerous on account of reports of an attempt at collusion on the part of the Royalist emigres in Spain and the Sidonistas with a view to a restoration of the Monarchy.The &quot; Batalha &quot; and Sinn Fein Propaganda.The extremist organ &quot; Batalha &quot; appears to be on its last legs. Most issues are now merely a single sheet. In its issue of the 5th May large headlines in the centre column announced that &quot; Things are Going Badly, Friends,&quot; stated its net loss at about 630?. a month, and appealed frantically for funds to the proletariat, whose enthusiasm however seems to cool when it is asked for money. . Lenin &amp; Co., after their experience in the railway strike, also seem disinclined to throw good money after bad in trying to bolster up Bolshevism in Portugal.The fact, however, that the &quot;Batalha &quot; goes on, shows that money is coming from somewhere. On 6th May the paper started a series of articles by Augustin Hamon on the Irish &quot;question and it has since been devoting itself largely to Sinn Fein propaganda, of which this is.stated to be the first appearance in Portugal.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.Extremists.There appear to be three shades of revolutionary thought in Norway, Bolshevist, Syndicalist, and Individualist. Adherents of all three parties show a more or less united front to the world for tactical purposes, and, given a good opportunity, they might, it is reported, be pursuaded to adopt a common policy towards revolution. The way of the leaders, however, would be hard, by reason of the discordant elements with which they would have to deal, and of the general distrust with which they are regarded by the workmen. In consequence, Norwegian extremists appear to have two voices, one for their own working classes, and the other for labour representatives. of foreign countries; They conclude that it is no longer of use to talk to Norwegian workmen about the
Imminence of revolution, and do all they can to impress upon tourists like Robert Williams that the Norwegian working classes will be ready when the occasion arises. It appears that only by encouraging revolutionaries in other countries can the Norwegian extremists hope to stimulate the apathy of their own.The Third International proposes to make Murmansk a base for revolutionary propaganda in Eastern Europe, with Schlovsky, the Bolshevik Commissar, as director of the organisation. Martin Tranmel is regarded as the official representative in Norway of the Russian Soviet Government. All applications for entry into Russia must be approved of and endorsed by Tranmel, whose local popularity and influence are said, however, to be on the wane.A general strike in Norway, which had been prepared for 22nd May, came to nothing. This strike was being supported by the Bolshevik Commissar at Murmansk, and was to have been carried out under the leadership of Martin Tranmel. It was to be of a political character, and to aim at the dictatorship of the proletarait.The Bolshevik agents, whose propaganda work is directed from Murmansk, are very active in Norway, and a considerable amount of literature has been confiscated by the Norwegian police at Vardo. The Norwegian authorities are lax as regards counter-measures, and there is reason to believe that this attitude is due to a desire on their part to re-open trade relations with Soviet Russia. There is indeed a certain agitation in favour of such trade. Sixty Tromso firms have forwarded a manifesto to the Government demanding that it should be re-opened forthwith. The Communist elements in Norway are making great play with the Polish offensive. The Extremist leaders are, however, en-endeavouring to restrain labour from spasmodic manifestations which waste themselves upon the air.The Communist Congress at Christiania.There is no very definite news of the Communist Congress at Christiania, which was to take place late in May. Delegates to it left Holland in the middle of May. The formation of Bolshevik schools of propaganda in Scandinavia was to be the chief subject of discussion at . the Syndicalist Conference which Strom and Carlsson were to attend in Christiania. Instructions for the organisation of sabotage are believed to have been issued from Moscow to all countries. One such organisation is already reported to exist in Germany. Extremists in Norway claim that one is to be formed shortly in England. The Norwegian extremist newspaper, &quot; Revolt,&quot; incites its readers to acts of sabotage and obstruc-tion at all works manufacturing arms or other war material.The only revolutionary stimulant at the May Day demonstration in Christiania was the presence of the British Labour delegation to Russia, who made boastful speeches of the strength and power of the revolu-tionaries in Great Britain.   Otherwise the day was a failure.The official index of the increased cost of living is given at 30 to 35 per cent, above the standard of 1919.SWEDEN.Both the Right and Left Wings of the Socialist party are making 1 vigorous preparations for the elections in September next, and appealing for funds... The rift between the Right and Left Socialists is reported to be widening. The Swedish Government decided, at the instance of Swedish firms anxious to enter into business relations with Soviet Russia, to protect money or credits placed by,tb.es Bolsheviks in Swedish banks
and 25,000,000 Swedish crowns in gold sent to Stockholm by the Swedish Government are to be held in the Swedish bank under Government control.Apart from this a certain amount of difficulty arose early in May when Krassin visited Stockholm to conclude agreements with Swedish firms before coming to London. The Swedish Government insisted that before the Almanna Export Foreningen concluded any agreement with the Centrosoyus, this export association should obtain an undertaking&quot; from Krassin that all Swedish property seized by the Soviet should be handed back and an indemnity paid for all merchandise requisitioned by the Bolsheviks. Krassin, to evade giving an answer, initiated the diplomatic practice, which Litvinoff inculcates so constantly, of retiring from political on to economic territory, and pointed out that he repre-sented the Centrosoyus, but not the Soviet Government. The Swedish Government, not having received permission to send an economic commission to Russia, had no intention of recognising Krassin as official representative of the Centrosoyus.All these verifications of Krassin&apos;s precise status had, however, been anticipated earlier in the month by firms anxious to forestall the Americans and to obtain, contracts from Soviet Russia. At the very beginning of May, the Swedish Bolshevik, Hellberg, concluded an agreement between the Baltic Company of Stockholm and Krassin, by which the company was to deliver 6,000,000 kronen worth of agricultural and dairy machines to Reval. Payment was to be in gold. Hellberg was reported to, be making 100,000 kronen out of the transaction. At the same time, Swedish representatives in Copenhagen, amongst whom were mentioned Mr. Bergwall, of the Baltic Company, and Director Lindhagen, formerly Mayor of Stockholm, were said to have made arrangements for the supply of machines, spare parts, and other commodities for Soviet Russia. The terms for payment were 40 per cent; in gold and 9 per cent, interest to be charged on the balance.The Swedish Bolshevik, Grimlund, who, in the first fortnight of May, managed to visit Litvinoff by travelling under a false name, was arrested later in the same month by the Danish authorities. Grimlund apparently had several missions to carry out on behalf of the Third International, and his arrest raised a storm of protest in Extremist circles in Sweden..DENMARK.The Danish Government, early in May, obtained absolute proof that Litvinoff, the Soviet Government^ representative-for Foreign Affairs, had been implicated in Bolshevik intrigue and propaganda in Denmark. Litvinoff is still at Copenhagen, where he is now intensely preoccupied with his own personal situation (which may, indeed, generally be taken as the raan&apos;s ruling motive), even to the point of subordinating to it Soviet policy in England, Sweden, or elsewhere. His shifts, now that lie knows his scope to be restricted by the vigilance of the Danish Government, by whom he has been in imminent danger of expulsion, will be amusing to watch. It is now probable that the elaborate plan for the transfer to Stockholm of the Soviet &quot; Diplomatic&quot; centre, abroad really originates in Litvinoff&apos;s personal uneasiness. There has also been some question of his transfer to Italy.According to a statement by the Danish Prime Minister the Govern-ment is not afraid of a violent revolution so much as of a gradual disintegration-tegration or dissolution of the social body by Communist agitation and propaganda.   They fear that this is being supported from abroad.
The dockers&apos; and soameu&apos;s strike at Copenhagen, after lasting two mouths (and obtaining the support, it may be said in passing, of the British Seamen&apos;s organisation, which promised an immediate contribution of 5,000/. with more to follow early in May), has been definitely broken by the intervention of the organised body of &quot; Community aiders &quot; which has been mentioned in previous reports. The number of these voluntary workers has been increasing almost day by day. It lias now reached a membership of 10,000. It is probable that other strikes will also be undermined.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.The Western Bureau o  the Third International.There is now positive evidence that the recently bruited closing down of the Third International at Amsterdam, announced to all the world by Moscow wireless, has not actually taken place. Wynlcoop, Rutgers, and Roland Hoist will continue their activities underground. The Moscow authorities, however, appear to have felt that a certain awkwardness, not to say gracelessness, was apparent in doing all they could to show an amiable face in London, while openly encouraging and arming Sinn Fein outrage and intrigue through Amsterdam. The Western Bureau has therefore been disowned, and its overt functions transferred to the Secretariat of East Europe at Leipzig under the direction of James Reich, alias Gordon. Information which cannot be called in question shows that it is nevertheless being kept in funds by Moscow, and that its subversive activities will be rather developed than mitigated.A reliable informant who is in a position to know states that Wynkoop was recently seen buying English banknotes to the value of from 400Z. to 500/. at the Twentsche Bank at Amsterdam. These purchases were made before his departure for Christiania and Moscow, and their scale would seem to indicate that they were for purposes other than his own personal expenses.Miscellaneous.The difficulty of controlling the movements of Communists passing between Holland and Belgium has been increased by a property quite close to the Belgian frontier owned by Mrs. Roland Hoist and used to smuggle agents across.An International anti-Militarist Congress to be attended by delegates from all European countries is to be held in Holland during the summer. Mr. Robert Smillie is mentioned as one possible delegate from this country. Troelstra, the Dutch Social-Democrat, is the moving spirit in the affair.GERMANY.General.The plans of the German reactionaries to reinstate themselves, and to achieve if not a world hegemony, which the loss of their fleet puts out of the question,, at any rate the ascendency in Europe of a central European monarchist block, depending for its wealth on the exploitation of Russia, are in intention as disquieting as ever. Two prime facts, however, appear to emerge, first, proposals of direct alliance with Soviet Russia have broken down again.   Kopp has been approached,O  11343-3&amp;c b
as Radek was formerly (see March report, Germany), but lie has refused participation on the grounds that it was clear that the German reaction-aries were only seeking to make a catspaw of Soviet Russia and her Red armies, which they would afterwards overthrow. In the second place the direct participation of the German Government as a Avhole has been pretty definitely eliminated, not that it was never in fact a menace, but because certain members of the latter body, notably Noske, the former Minister of Defence, have amassed sufficient fortunes to enable them to cut so dangerous a connection. While this is true, however, of the Government as a corporate body, it is certain that the reactionaries have servants in high place among the permanent officials, notably in the Foreign Office and in Ministries abroad. Although again it, is thought unlikely that any definite agreement exists between the leaders of Sparticists and the parties of the Extreme Right, the condition of Germany is so desperate that if the Reds were to seize power the military party might join them rather than go under.Most people in Germany itself appear to be counting on a putsch from either the Right or the Left, and there is a pretty general opinion that the Monarchists will pursue their former policy of inciting the Left to revolu-tion, and then stepping in to restore order. There is a general tendency in both Socialist and Bourgeois circles to look to the restoration of some form of royalty to save the country from political and economic disaster.One disquieting aspect of the present situation is that four million rifles are unaccounted for and &apos; are believed to have found their way into the Spartacist organisation through returned soldiers who sold them. ( Vide below : Independent Socialist Party.)Plans of the Reactionaries.Following on the Conferences in April (see May report: Germany) two military Conferences were held in Berlin early in May, and were attended by General Ludendorff, General von Watter, and General von Moehl. Speaking of the Polish offensive General LudendorfF said that both the present German Government and the German Syndicalists, and Communists were opposed to Poland&apos;s attack on Russia. This appeared to give an opportunity. He suggested that Kopp should be approached, and that plans should be made for Germany to join the Bolsheviks.Von Moehl spoke on the situation in Bavaria, where, he stated, everything was proceeding satisfactorily, but that military preparations for a new counter-revolutionary coup were not yet completed.Von Watter urged that Prussia was not yet ready, and that it was essential that preparations should be complete before any attempt was made to carry out a new putsch.An interesting speech was made by Captain von Kanitz, who stated that the Government meant to take strong measures against the counter-revolutionaries.At the conclusion of the meeting four resolutions were passed : (1) In favour of preparations being carried out quicker. (2) On the necessity of obtaining outside help, especially from Russia.(3) On the desirability of approaching Victor Kopp.(4) In favour of sending von Boris to Hungary to ask what the Hungarians plans were, and to find out whether they were willing to join in LudendorfTs scheme against Poland.As regards the third resolution Kopp has already been approached, and refused to participate in any action with the German reactionaries
on the grounds that it was clear that Germany was going to serve her own ends, and afterwards overthrow the Bolsheviks. Ludendorffappears to have anticipated the failure of overtures to Kopp, and to have entered into some sort of agreement with Mannerheim (see Finland: Reaction-aries and German Intrigue). In March Ludendorff sent a spesial emissary to the leader of the White Party in Finland to ascertain what action he would take in the event of the Germans attacking the Bolsheviks. He received a reply guaranteeing the support of the White Russians in any operations against Soviet Russia. Count Palen, under the direction of General Gurko in Berlin, is giving financial assistance obtained from German sources, to ex-officers of the Russian North-west Army who are of German orientation, the idea being that these officers may be employed in a reactionary movement , which may arise in Germany.Falkenhayn appears to be playing a prominent part in the activities of the reactionary party in Germany, and is working in close touch with Colonel Reinhard.The Polish offensive in its early stages apparently caused considerable alarm amongst the German reactionary party, who were at that time inclined to hurry on preparations for a new putsch which they intended to carry out early in July. The subsequent defeat of the Poles has probably altered their plans* again. Noske is now reported to have ceased to co-operate with the Militarists, having amassed a small fortune which he states has been obtained &quot; through writing for American newspapers &quot; !Falkenhayn&apos;s plan for the coming putsch is to abandon Berlin in the early stages to the Communist and to retire to Pomerania, Baden, and Bavaria, Four army corps are to be supplied by these States, which would conduct a campaign against the Ruhr and Berlin.On coming into power the reactionaries intend to proceed with the greatest care not to prejudice their position by direct refusal to carry out the terms of the Peace Treaty. At first they will demand small things ou which they can count upon the world backing them and for which the working classes of Europe and America would not consent to go to war.They hoped not to be the attacking party, but wish to be attacked by the Entente for refusal to carry out certain terms of the Peace Treaty. If the Entente does not pursue an aggressive policy, Germany will proceed forthwith against Poland.According to a report by an informant, who returned from East Prussia about the middle of May, the country then resembled a huge military camp, the whole of the peasantry having been armed by the reactionaries, in whose hand were all official posts and under whose influence the whole administration of the Reichwehr fell. Troops at that time were everywhere marching through the streets flying black, white, and red banners and singing the old National Anthem. Martial law, which Avas still in force in East Prussia, afforded a welcome opportunity to the military party to use drastic measures against the democratic and labour sections of the community.The Foreign Office.It seems probable that Dr. Koester, the new German Minister for Foreign Affairs, is as much in the hands of the Junker officials in the Foreign Office as his predecessor Herr Mueller. In the tone of the Foreign Office itself there appears to be no change, and apart from Dr. Koester there is no one occupying a prominent post who does not belong to the old bureaucracy. Dr. Koester is reported from a good source to be spending money to gain the sympathy both of the ItalianB 2
and also of the English members of the Press. Advices from Italy confirm this report as far as that country is concerned, Acting on the recommendation of Dr. Stamer, Gorman Minister in London, Koester has also been advising leading German journalists to abstain from attacking Great Britain. It is his opinion that England&apos;s present policy will shortly isolate France both politically and economically.The Hamburg Opposition Group in the Communist Party.In close conjunction with reactionaries of all colours must be placed the Hamburg Opposition Group of the German Communist Party with its policy of &quot; national Bolshevism.&quot; This group, while adhering to the Third International, favours military action against the Entente in order to annul the Versailles Peace Treaty, and at a conference latish in April, where the delegates were said to represent 40,000 members, was re-named the &quot;Kommunistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands.&quot; Its leaders are Lauffenberg and Wolffheim, who work in conjunction with the Syndicalisms &quot; Arbeiter Union,&quot; and have many adherents among the dockers. This group of extremists is reported to be in possession of very large quantities of rifles, ammunition, &amp;c.Prior to the Putsch in Germany there was a liaison between officers of the Reichswehr and its leaders. Officers attended meetings of the group, and its so-called national Bolshevism seems to have been much discussed in reactionary circles. The Hamburg group is in direct opposition to the German Communist Party, which is under the leadership of James Reich. One of the reasons given by the central executive of the German Communist Party for the dissolution of the Amsterdam Bureau was that Rutgers and his associates supported the policy of Lauffenberg and Wolffheim. As stated elsewhere, however, there is excellent reason to believe that this dissolution has not, in fact, taken place, and that its activities have merely been driven underground.Anti-Semitism.Not unconnected with the proceedings of the Junker military and national Bolshevik parties would appear to be the recent revival of anti-Semitism, which is reported both from occupied territory and from the interior of Germany.Russian Reactionaries in Germany.Russian reactionaries in Germany have apparently not lost hope. A conference held at Frankfurt-on-Main early in May discussed the situation of the White Armies, and, it is believed, decided to proceed with their plans of forming White Armies to carry on war against the Bolsheviks. General Glassenap in London, General Krasnow in Berlin, and General Vladimirow in Paris are said to be doing what they can to obtain support for this project. Gutschkow was in May trying to get permission in Paris for the Baltic troops interned in Germany to take part in the Polish offensive against Russia.Russian Cadets in Berlin.The Russian reactionaries are, however, opposed by the Cadets. Miljukoff and Nobokoff were expected in Berlin about the beginning of June for the purpose of weakening the influence of the Russian reactionary committee there, either by active opposition to it or by widening it by the inclusion of members of other political groups so as to make its policy saner. The Cadets are against any form of foreign intervention in Russian affairs, and hold strong views with regard to the Polish offensive.    Their party in Germany lacks organisation.   The
prominent members are working actively to bring about improvements in that respect.Trade and ether Relations with Soviet Russia.The present policy of the German Government towards Soviet Russia is said to lie along a middle course between an alliance with Russia as a counterpoise to oppression by the Entente and opposition to any relations at all. The Government does not consider that the right moment lias come to enter into commercial relations with Russia, but is both keeping in touch with Kopp and watching Russian affairs very closely. A strict control of the Eastern frontier is still being maintained. According to a statement by an informant, who was in touch in the second half of May with Victor Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin, trade relations between the two countries are at a standstill. No contracts had then been completed, but individual merchants were travelling freely between Germany and Russia. Two organisations are apparently in existence for arranging the transfer of German skilled labour to Soviet Russia ; one, a purely Communist organisation, has already despatched a considerable number of men ; the second is non-Communist, and is refraining from action until affairs in Soviet Russia become more settled.Before the Polish offensive a Mission arrived in Berlin from the Ukraine to negotiate for the re-establishment of trade relations between that country and Germany and to arrange for the purchase of farming implements, chemicals, &amp;c.Independent Socialist Party.Towards the middle of May the Executive Committee of the Moscow International published a violent attack on the policy of the Independents, demanding that the latter should definitely declare their attitude towards the Moscow International before the vyorkmen&apos;s public meetings took place in Berlin. In the Cologne district the Communists are said to have succeeded in forcing their programme cn the Independents. In any further revolutionary movements in Occupied Territory, the Independent Socialist Party has promised the workers its support in men aud money. It is, however, against German Militarism in any form. The Red Army in the Ruhr district is now practically dissolved, but its members have, in most cases, succeeded in retaining their arms.The German Independent Socialists, the Rhineland Centre Party and clericals all oppose any separation of the Rhenish lands from the Empire.There appear to be no less than six Revolutionary Committees in Berlin, directing their efforts to the detriment of Great Britain. These organisations include the Egyptian Committee, the Germano-Irish Society, the Society of Oppressed Peoples, the Indian Committee and the Pan-Islamic Committee. There appears to be considerable co-opera-tion between the first two named. As regards the Germano-Irish Society a good deal of correspondence is being received from Ireland, and the work appears to involve considerable movement between Berlin and Munich.The &quot; Society of Oppressed Peoples,&quot; which has its headquarters at Berlin, and is under the Presidency of Colonel Edwin Emerson, an American, has for its object the binding together of the so-called &quot; Oppressed&quot; nations and the creation of a powerful and extensive organisation,, which is to be represented in every country.John de Kay is a member of the Inner Council of this organisation, and its secretary is the well-known Indian, Pillai.
John de Kay&apos;s &quot;League of Oppressed Peoples&quot; is apparently meeting . with the approval both of the Bolshevik authorities and the Germans. The latter have expressed a special desire that the League shall have its headquarters in their country, probably because they see a possibility for causing trouble in British Colonies or Protectorates. A report has been received that Extreme Nationalist elements in Constantinople are sending delegates to meet others of their party in Italy. It seems probable that these individuals are proceeding to Rome or Fiume iu order to attend a Conference of &quot; Oppressed Peoples &quot; which is to be held shortly.SWITZERLAND.Precautions in case of disorder.The Federal Government has in the past three months elaborated very definite measures in case of a revolutionary outbreak. Instruc-tions embodying these have been issued to the Army, and include a free use of arms in the event of a disturbance in which the rioters get to the length even of throwing stones. Firearms and machine guns are then to be used without restriction. Arrangements have also been made for the publication in the event of a revolutionary movement of bulletins dealing with the general situation. The existence in fact of organisations menacing to the State was demonstrated iu the Federal Assembly late in April by the Federal Councillor in charge of the Department of Justice and Police.The Polish offensive has come as a relief to members of the party of order. It is regarded as having put a stop, at any rate for a time, to the threatened BolsheAak invasion.Meanwhile the Swiss Communist, Platten, has been arrested by the Swiss authorities.Eastern Nationalism.Lausanne is a centre of Nationalist communication from which orders are sent to revolutionaries in Oriental countries. Communication is so rapid that matter published at Angora is received in Lausanne in between 10 days and a fortnight. The Nationalists regard the channel through which their important communications are sent as absolutely safe, and it has been ascertained that the Italian Consulate at Lausanne is the Swiss end of that channel. In this connection, it is interesting to note that a certain Reshad Bey, concerned in Switzerland in the purchase of munitions, &amp;c, for the Turkish Nationalists, has spoken highly of the help given to him and his friends by Guisi, of the Italian Consulate at Lausanne.International Congress of Miners.The International Congress of Miners will take place at Geneva on the 2nd August, and will deal mainly with the nationalisation of mines. Robert Smillie, the president of the International Federation of Miners, will represent Great Britain.AUSTRIA.Political.The voluntary resignation of Dr. Renner, the Austrian Chancellor, is expected, and it is rumoured that Count Albert Mensdorf, former Austrian representative in this country, whose policy is likely to be pro-English, may become President. Early in May the Austrian Govern-ment approached the representatives of the Allied Government in Vienna,
asking tliem to sanction the release of Bela Knn and other Hungarian Communists interned in Steinhof, with a view to their deportation to Soviet Russia. If this be done it is not impossible that Hungarian officers may attempt to kidnap Bela Kun en route.The Communists and the Social Democrats.Considerable social and industrial unrest was reported in April. At Vienna especially strikes took place in rapid succession, and there was a marked increase in tho anti-Semitic movement, the streets being placarded Avith propaganda. Numerous demonstrations, in which the students were active, also took place. The reason ascribed was the exhaustion of the home produce of Upper Austria. Communists suc-ceeded in terrorising the town of Linz. For the most part, however, the working classes dissociated themselves openly from the Communist activities, and denounced them for their activities in connection with the rioting. Events, in fact, have proved the numerical weakness of the Communist party. According to Dr. Renner the Social Democratic leaders are doing their best to isolate its adherents, which were said to consist mainly of adventurers and criminals.From a source which is at least interested if not dubious, it was, however, reported in May that the Austrian Social Democratic Party had declined to participate in the Congress of the Second International, which is to be held on 31st July, and that Frederick Adler, one of its leaders, had suggested negotiations with the parties of the Third Inter-national, citing as analogous the position of the British Independent Labour Party.The Communists and the Volkswehr.The reorganisation of the army, completed in April, was described as a complete victory for the Left Socialists. The institution of soldiers&apos; councils was retained, and these councils, of which the present Volkswehr virtually consists, were to have, the decisive word in the organisation of the new army. With the Volkswehr as it is, the new army will be devoid of discipline. The worst elements will re-enlist and good men will seek other employment. The Reorganisation Bill provides that any soldier can become an officer on completion of a certain course, a proviso which will probably end by purging the officers&apos; corps also of all but unde-sirables.That the Bill was not energetically opposed was due partly to the indifference of the Christian Socialist peasants, who will have occasion to come in contact with only small detachments of the Volkswehr, partly again to the anxiety of non-Socialist ministers about the stability of the Government, and partly to the reaction against the Monarchist Putsch in Berlin, of which the Socialists took full advantage. The result is that the new Government is practically at the mercy of an army well on the way to be composed solely of rogues and vagabonds, and that the social order stands defenceless in the face of any attempt at sabotage and any menace from the extremists. Separatist tendencies in the provinces will be accentuated.At a meeting of the Biirger and Stiinde-Rat in Vienna, which the Communists Avere trying to break up, the police, in trying to keep order, were opposed by a detachment of Volkswehr of whom they got the better only after a serious struggle.Miscellaneous.The headquarters of the Austrian Monarchist party are reported to be in Budapest, but their principal meetings are held in Vienna.   There
are branches of the party iu Prague, Brunn, Krakau, Lemberg, Gratz, and Laibach.A recently established pro-Italian newspaper entitled &quot; Osterreichische Staats Zeitung &quot; had to cease publication early in April because it became known that it was subsidised to the extent of half a million lire by Italian banks.HUNGARY.The situation of Admiral Horthy during the past months has been anything but comfortable. On the one hand he is held to blackmail by the White Extremists, whose outrages he is afraid to curb lest his former implication with them should be discovered ; on the other his approaches to the Hungarian Socialists, Garami, Payer, Peidl, and Buchinger, made probably at the instance of Count Apponyi, have been rejected. Dis-agreements between the Christian Block and the Smallholders have undermined the formation of a Moderate party under Count Teleky, and au attempt to weld the extreme Monarchists into an opposition which would work for the gradual restoration of the Archduke Joseph, first as Governor and later as King, has also failed.Admiral Horthy thus finds himself isolated in a sea of contending distractions, the Smallholders party gradually inclining more and more to the Left as their hopes of a majority at the elections across the Theiss grow stronger, while the anti-Semites in army circles hound the Jews from the villages into the towns. Ninety-eight per cent, of the money capital in Hungary is in Jewish hands, a state of affairs brought about by the Christian aversion from and contempt for trade. The decision of the International Federation of Trade Unions to boycott Hungary on 15th July unless the &quot;White Terror&quot; is renounced adds to Admiral Horthy&apos;s many anxieties.The Budapest Military Court has issued a warrant for the arrest of M. Karolyi, who is at present believed to be in Prague. He is accused of inciting to the murder of Count Tisza, seducing troops from their allegiance, lese majeste, and revolt.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Foreign Relations.The situation created by the secret alliance between the Poles and the Hungarians against Czecho-Slovakia, which was reported in our May report, is leading to reprisals on the part of the Czecho-Slovaks.The Bohemians have been buying large quantities of arms in Germany, which are believed to be intended for an offensive against the Poles towards the end of the summer. The Government have been making inquiries in Italy, whether, in case of a Czecho-Slovak offensive against Poland, Italy will undertake to keep the Jugo-Slavs quiet.Finance.The Czecho-Slovakian Government is very much behindhand in its finances. It is reliably reported that one of the largest industrial con-cerns in Czecho-Slovakia is now the Governments debtor to the extent of 30 million kronen, seven million of which should have been paid last autumn. The recent rise in the value of the Czech crown is attributed to its purchase in Switzerland by American companies, which include the New York Guaranty Trust Company.
Communists.That the communist parties in Bohemia and Moravia are working for a revolution is confirmed by accounts of speeches at divers meetings of the Left Wing Socialist Democratic Party. Late in April the delegation from Kladno, which came to Prague to demand the creation of workers&apos;, soldiers&apos;, and peasants&apos; councils, expressed dissatisfaction with the Prime Ministers reply. Demands from industrial centres for workers&apos; councils are reported to be increasing.The army shows a general lack of discipline, especially among the legions who have returned from Russia. This may be generally attri-buted to party differences, and does, in some cases, amount to unrest. The Government is aware of the situation, and has taken steps, through the public safety organisations, to meet it should occasion arise.The Elections.Many charges of unfairness, many of which appear to be well founded, have been made against the Government in the recent elections. A law was passed by which all soldiers were obliged to vote in the area in which they were stationed. The movement of troops prior to the elections were stated to be not unconnected with electoral necessities. Large sums are reported to have been spent in unofficial bribes, and a cross put on the voting papers before the names of Government candi-dates is said to have imposed on the sympathy and ignorance of the country folk, who thought that the name with the cross before it was the one to vote for, and even perhaps invested the symbol with religious significance.4. RUSSIA AND BORDER STATES.FINLAND. Peace Negotiations at Dorpat.The peace negotiations between the Finnish Government and Soviet Russia at Dorpat, though they are. now on a diplomatic basis and no longer merely envisage, on the Finnish side, the resumption of trade relations, are not reported to be making great strides. In the discussions regarding Petchenga and Karelia, Bolshevik pretensions and Finnish obstinacy are apparently at grips, and even the advantage to the Soviet authorities or a transfer of troops, estimated at from 40,000 to 48,000, to the Polish front, has not hastened a settlement. The Erich-Ingman-Ehmrooth Government has shown tendencies of a reversion still further to the Right, which is visible in ihe reinstatement in the Foreign Ministry of officials who, while the pro-Entente Dr. Holsti was head df the Government, had to resign. Mr. George Gripenherg, for instance, has returned, and Baron Ernst Fabian Vredc, who gave a passport to Ludendorff, has been appointed to a temporary post. It seems probable that the present Government will remain in power, at any rate till the autumn.The Schutz Corps and German Activities.The German element in Finland is seeking to strengthen its position by typically Prussian means, and is reported, as it acquires power, to be using it in a typically Prussian manner. The Schutz Corps was reported in April to be acting with a very high hand in the country districts, where meetings even of the right Social Democratic Party were broken
up and speakers grossly ill-treated. Foreseeing that demobilisation may come, its administration has formed a union for mutual defence, and in view of the possibility of the Government withdrawing all arms bought from Government funds, has bought arms from Germany with its own. Certain members of the German Foreign Office are very reliably reported to have been negotiating with Mannerheim, not only for the despatch of arms and ammunition for Finland (in exchange for which Germany was to receive timber, &amp;c), but for the despatch to Finland of some of the troops who formerly belonged to Yudenitch&apos;s army. Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin, having discovered these activities, spoke to the German Foreign Minister, Koester, whose threat to resign showed that Kopp had come very near the truth. Reports to the effect that quantities of German arms and ammunition and other war materials have been landed at Helsingfors are too numerous and apparently too well founded for the published denials and explanations of the Schutz Corps to carry much weight. It is also noteworthy that Mr. Janues, Finnish Minister at Berlin, is a Monarchist, while Baron von Bruck, the German Minister in Finland, belongs to the old Junker regime, and the move-ments between Helsingfors and Poland of certain Kapp officers require explanation.The shipbuilding industry in Finland is also active on subsidies from German banks, and many specialists are being supplied from Germany to work in the yards, as also in their new factories now being built. Germany, forbidden by the Versailles Treaty to build ships herself, has, in the eyes of the Finns, not lost the right to do so in Russia or in Finlaud. The growth of German influence may also be apparent in the intended deportation of large numbers of Russians from Helsingfors, Newland Province, and from Finland in general. It is said that a list has been drawn up for this purpose, and that no more residential permits are to be issued to persons on it.The increased pressure, as well as the fact of a more conciliatory policy of the British Government, is visible in the change of attitude of the newspaper, Novaya Russkaya Jisn, which no longer sides so exclusively with the Russian White organisations, but thanks those British who are still faithful to the Russian people. British workmen are, nevertheless, warned by the newspaper against the exchange of goods with Soviet Russia, whose assurances about raw material and the possibility of transport, it says, are not to be believed.The Social. Democratic Party and Socialist Labour Party.M. Sventorzetski, speaking early in May, referred to the split in the Social Democratic Party, which has given birth to the Finnish Socialist Labour Party. He ridiculed the idea of communism in Finland, where, he said, everything was possible by parliamentary means if such means were only used and were not frustrated by the excesses of the Right. Of the workers, he said that 60 per cent, were in reality Centre, a fact which was veryobvious at the recent Party Congress, while 20 per cent, were Right and 20 per cent. Left. The Left leaders were, however, making use of the general dissatisfaction with the Right, and, under orders from Kuusinen and the Finnish Communist Party in Petrograd, were endeavouring to make the Centre Party throw its weight to the Left. He strongly deprecated the formation of the new Socialist Labour Party, which would split the Centre.At the constituent meeting of the Left Socialist Party, however, which was held at Helsingfors on 14th May 1920, a new party was formed under the name of the Finnish Socialist Labour Party. Its programme is virtually that of the German Independent Socialist Party
and it adheres to the Third International .ou the basis of its own programme, which excludes the arming of the proletariat. The stated policy of this parly is said to be rather evolutionary than one of armed revolution, though its stands for the introduction, as soon as possible, of the Council or Soviet system in industry or land, both of which, it says, should be taken over by the State. The constituent meeting of this party was held at Helsingfors towards the middle of May, but two days after its formation it was dissolved by the Finnish Government on the grounds that it had decided to adhere to the Third International. The extremists, Sulo Vuolijoki, Pekkala, and others, were arrested.While these arrests were undoubtedly the act of a Government the members of which, with the exception of Holsti, must be described as extreme reactionaries, there is some show of reason for them in that the omission from the programme of the Third International of the clauses regarding the arming of the proletariat was admittedly Oppor-tunist and did not really represent the convictions of those who voted for the party&apos;s adhesion to the Third International. The new party, iu fact, appears to grope in the same mental fog as Mr. George Lansbury, who also thinks that he can adhere to the Third International on his own programme. If Messrs. Pekkala and Sulo Vuolojoki were asked, as Mr. Lansbury was by Lenin, to which side in the event of armed revolution they would adhere, they also would be compelled to answer, &quot; To the workers&apos;.&quot;The police had also been active against the Left Socialists earlier in the month. The suppression of the Left Socialist paper, Savon Kama, which is published at Kuopio, caused considerable indignation in Socialist circles. An endeavour to publish the same organ under a different title led to its confiscation by the police. The paper has now emerged uuder yet another avatar.Communists.A split is reported to have occurred in the Finnish Communist party at Petrograd. The new faction accuses the leaders of the party of omitting to prepare for a Finnish revolution. It is possible that this omission on their part represents attraction to the policy of the Finnish Socialist Labour party at home. In a letter to his comrades in Petrograd a Finnish Communist describes ihe situation in his own country as hopeless from a revolutionary point of view. He states that, owing to the strength of the Civil Guard, there is no possible chance of the revolution having any success unless it is supported from outside.Valpas, the former leader of the Finnish Communists in Petrograd, who returned to Finland at the end of 1919 and was arrested by the authorities, has now been senteuced to hard labour for life for high treason, iBaltic States, ESTHONLA.The attitude of Hellat.Opinions even of competent informants differ widely as regards the real attitude of the Esthonian Government in face of the menace of Bolshevism on its borders.According to both the Esthonian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is a member of the Right Party, and Mr. Virgo, a prominent. Social Democrat, there is no possibility of Esthonia going Bolshevik provided she does not become bankrupt.
Hellat, the Prime Minister, and most living power in the adminis-tration, is said not to be so red as he has been painted. His measures towards both the Reds aud Whites certainly appear to be sufficiently drastic. The anti-Bolshevik League, which formerly had its head-quarters at Reval, has been broken up by the authorities and the Russian Whites expelled, while Esthonian citizens have been forbidden under severe penalties to take any part in anti-Bolshevik espionage or other similar activities. A correspondent of the Morning Post who recently wrote to that paper in a very anti-Bolshevik sense was also turned out of Esthonia.As a set-off, the deportation of several hundred Russian Reds who had been trying to raise trouble in Esthonia must be quoted, and Hellat&apos;s unpopularity among the extremists, both in Esthonia or across the border, seems to be shown by leaflets distributed in Reval, which accuse him of betraying the proletariat.Land Legislation.It is anticipated that after the elections this month some slight changes in the land reform scheme will take place in the sense of making it less drastic. On the present basis the peasants are granted a maximum of 400 acres in perpetuity. They have the right, on leaving the land or transferring it, to compensation for buildings and improvements. So far the Government, have only nationalised estates belonging to the German Baltic barons who have fled the country. Later they intend to nationalise the other large estates, paying compensation to the owners.Early in May it wag reported that members of the Right Party in the Esthonian Government were working, (it was hinted at the instance of German agents) to overthrow the present Government and elect new members for a constituent assembly.Trade Affairs.Gukowsky, the Bolshevik trade representative at Reval, has received many offers of business, which, however, rarely come to fruition owing to the high prices demanded for manufactured goods. . Gukowsky is not in a position to acton his own initiative, and is obliged to refer all trans-actions to Moscow, which in turn refers them to Copenhagen, where Litvinoff, the Soviet representative, appears to be too preoccupied with the difficulties of his own personal situation to deal with them effectively. Gukowsky is now reported to have been recalled. It is noteworthy that Krassin, while assenting to the proposals from Moscow to establish litvinoff at Stockholm as political agent for Scandinavia, is also insisting on the appointment with him of a really competent commercial agent in the person of Stomoniakoff, the Bulgarian ex-engineer and friend of Lenin. That the Bolsheviks have purchased paper for propaganda purposes through the Reval delegation to the tune of six million Czar roubles is an indication of the extreme subordination of commerce to politics, for which Lenin stands and which Krassin detests.That the extreme of capitalism appears to be regarded in Esthonia as almost as pressing a danger as Bolshevism itself is not altogether astonishing in view of the reported doings of a British trading company known as the Fortiugton Group. This group, which is largely backed by Jews, buys flax at approximately 201. a ton from the grower and sells it at 40/. a ton in England, a procedure injurious both to the grower aud to the consumer. The poverty of countries like Esthonia and Latvia and the necessity which drives their Governments to raise money for the country&apos;s needs by arrangements with commercial sharks is unfortunate.
Such financial groups, however, instead of helping the rehabilitation of the countries they exploit, merely encourage the spread of Bolshevism and bring discredit upon the commercial good name of Britain.POLAND.The Offensive against Russia.In the course of an interview granted towards the middle of May, Vassilevski, the Polish representative in Esthonia, said that the Polish offensive was part of a programme for the establishment of a treaty of alliance between the States bordering upon Soviet Russia, arid stretching from the Arctic to the Black Sea. The object of the Poles was the forma-tion of a stable government in the Ukrane under General Petlura, whose country could then join the alliance and form a part of the rampart against the union of Russia and Germany. Poland, as compensation for her assistance, would receive Galicia.Discipline in the Polish army, which is a loose amalgam of German, Austrian, and Russian Poles, is reported not to be good. For fighting quality the German Poles are far the best, the Austrians and Russians being described as unreliable. At the beginning of June the Poles were reported to be treating their prisoners well, and to have won them over, so that two-thirds had refused to return to Soviet Russia, and a consider -able proportion had started working for the Poles.Prior to the offensive it was reported that Austrian and Hungarian officers had been recruited for the Polish army, offices for the purpose having been opened at Vienna and Budapest.Communists.The Polish Communist party has now been driven completely under-ground, where it is trying to persuade the trades unions to work against the Nationalist and Socialist parties. The success of Communist propa-ganda among the troops, which is stated to exist, is unlikely, unless the military situation becomes definitely unfavourable.Miscellaneous.German colonists residing and owning land in Poland have been given two years to set their affairs in order and clear out of the country. Berlin has sent them instructions to sit tight in the meantime and do nothing.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES. ROUMANIA.Reports on the wheat situation in Roumania are not encouraging and it seems doubtful whether there will be enough grain to cover the needs of the local population. The exchange in Roumania is again very low, owing to the fall in export, to speculation and to pressure exercised by Anglo-American financial circles with a view to obtaining economical advantages. It is estimated, however, that with favourable crops the economic-situation should right itself completely within five years.A gang of money forgers at Slatina succeeded early in the year in placing false Roumanian 500 lei notes, to the total value of five millions, on the Roumanian market.
BULGARIA.The elections in the Philippopolis region having been declared invalid, the Agrarian party now has an independent majority of three over all other parties combined. Its situation is, however, uncertain enough to make Stambolisky incline to a Coalition Ministry. The determination, however, of the remainder of the Agrarian party to retain a homogeneous Government representing their interests will probably prevail.There is evidence of nascent, if not already considerably developed, co-operation between Bulgaria and Italy on the one hand and Islam on the other. A Bulgar-Italian Committee has been formed in Borne to encourage the rapprochement between the two countries, the working basis being that Bulgaria shall do all she can to weaken the Serbo-Greek influence in the Balkans, whilst Italy, for her part, will try to get those clauses annulled in the Peace Treaty which are territorially unfavourable to Bulgaria. Meanwhile Italy is to supply arms for the Bulgar-Islamic Committee.GREECE.Reports appear to indicate that all is not well with the Anglophile Liberal party of M. Venizelos, whose election prospects in part of Old Greece, in Salonica, and in Western Thrace are said to be anything but safe. Stories of prospective co-operation between the Socialists and the Royalists are in the air. The Royalists have in any case been financing the Socialists, whose part in the * alliance is said to be intended to counterbalance the efforts of non-Socialist workmen to save the pan-Hellenic conference from the Socialist Bolshevik group which has been trying to capture it.A meeting of the latter in April decided that the party should take part in the elections, but should refuse to co-operate with other political parties in any way. A resolution was also passed in favour of the nationalisation of land and closer connection with other Balkan Communist parties.There are signs also of a recrudescence of not only German but French support for the Royalist party. Germans who were banished during the war are said to be returning and their old organisations are being re-started. German support, however, is not looked upon as of value at present and the Constantine party is turning to the French instead, whose present dismay with English policy will, it is surmised, tend to bring them into opposition with the Anglophilism of M. Venizelos and of his followers. . The Greek Catholic party appears to be taking part in this movement with the idea of enlisting French support against the English and American Protestants, aud the Orthodox parties in general.Rumour has it that the King has stated that after the elections he will resign in favour of his father, whom France will support.Monarchists of all nationalities appear to have an important centre in Rome, where an active group led byLambros Coromilas busies itself with propaganda and intrigue in favour of Constantiue&apos;s restoration. The intriguers appear to be in touch with the Monarchists in Germany, the recent coup oVetat being known to them before its occurrence. They also maintain touch with Switzerland through one Angelo Raianti, who is said to have received 200,000 Italian lire in American dollars sent for pro-Constantine propaganda from the U.S.A.
6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.The opposition of the Turkish Nationalists to the draft treaty has come to a head in the attack on British troops at the Ismid Peninsula.Reports have concurred in increasing volume in depicting the network of Nationalist intrigue with its centre at Angora, which may now be said to embrace all Nationalist and Pan-Islamic aspirations in the Middle East.The succession of events during the past two months can only be described as bewildering, though their general import is clear, and the mist of rumours purposely circulated makes discrimination between reports difficult.Reports from Constantinople dated about the middle of April, stated almost simultaneously that the activities of the Nationalists there were being transferred to Paris, as Constantinople Avas too hot for the intriguers, and that the existence in Stamboul of a Nationalist bureau, under the direction of Hakki Bey, had been established. Mustapha Kemal at Angora was then said to have communicated to Salih Pasha, late Grand Vizier, the fact that he was in constant communication with Sherif Foisul, through the Kurdish chief, Ajem Pasha Saadul. In this connection it is interesting to note that about the same date an Arab delegation arrived at Damascus for the purpose of negotiating union with Turkish Nationalists on purely Pan-Islamic grounds.Later reports leave no room for doubt that direct touch has been established between the Emir Feisal and Mustapha Kemal Pasha, and that a defensive alliance between them has also been signed. Evidence in confirmation of the collusion of the Arab Emir and the Nationalist leader, both direct and indirect, has been received.The indirect evidence consists of a printed proclamation signed by Ibti Saoud, the Central Arabian chief, and enemy of the Emir Feisul, to the Syrian notables and religious leaders. In this proclamation Saoud refers to the part played by the Amir of Mecca and of the Hedjaz in the dispersal of the Arab nation and the destruction of Arab unity as notorious. Had he confined himself only to dealing Avith the affairs of the Hedjaz, the case, according to Ibn Saoud, would not be so bad, but &quot; He (may God punish him for it) has arrived at agreements and signed &quot; alliances which have thrown all the other Arab countries, which form &quot; the principal centres of Islam, into the abyss.&quot;The direct evidence consists of a telegram addressed to the Turkish War Minister by the Officer Commanding the 15th Ottoman army corps, dated 28th December 1919.   It runs as follows -: &quot; The chief of the Milli Tribe, Ismail Pasha Zacleh Ismail Bey, has received from Emir Faisal, the son of the Sherif, a dagger worth 500 liras ; and in a letter addressed to the chief of the Milli Tribe the Emir Faisal stated that he had communicated with the Ottoman Government and had declared that the moment had arrived when all Mussulmans should be united in the name of their religion to work for the welfare of Islam.&quot;&apos;This telegram was actually reported early in January, but the information was not at that time considered reliable. The original has since been received and there seems no doubt that it is genuine.
It was also reported early this month from a different source that the Turkish Nationalists on their side claimed that negotiations are being conducted between Mustapha Kemal Pasha and Saati Bey, Minister of Education iu Emir Faisal&apos;s Cabinet, and former President of the Turkish University, with a view to the formation of Nationalist bands in Syria and mutual co-operation against the Enteute&apos;s policy of expansion. Altogether the collusion of Arab and Nationalist no longer admits of doubt.About the same date it was reported that frequent applications were also being made by Turks to the Russian Labour Exchange then recently opened in Constantinople to obtain Russian techuical and engineering experts, whose services were required in Anatolia for the reconstruction of roads and railways and the repair of the workshops. Large salaries and other privileges were being offered. Later in the month it was reported that the Turkish Nationalists, in concurrence with the Pan-Islamic Society, had agreed to disown the Turkish Sultan and had established friendly relations with the heir-apparent, who was openly opposed to the peace terms. A Pan-Islamic conference, to be held in Kabul, was also reported. The Amir of Afghanistan was to preside, and the proposal to be discussed was that as soon as Mustapha Kemal opened hostilities the Amir should follow his lead and declare a &quot; Jehad.&quot;About the same date a group of persons under the direction of the Turkish Minister of Education and the Director-General of Turkish Orphanages was endeavouring to inaugurate a new society for philan-thropic work which, under the cloak of charitable enterprises, might eventually become a political organisation. This society was to have negotiations with Islamic centres throughout the world.&apos;In the first half of May it was reported that Mustapha Kemal&apos;s National Assembly at AngoraJiad declared that it refused to be bound by any treaty, agreement, or convention with any foreign power con-cluded since the armistice by any Turkish Government. A day or two later an extraordinary court-martial sitting at Constantinople sentenced Mustapha Kemal and his associates to death in contumaciam.A large number of Russian officers were said to have joined the Turkish Nationalist forces. Some reports stated that they were starving and could only live by joining the Turks, but others said that they had ulterior motives, and Avere supported by the Russian Embassy at Constantinople.Meanwhile a report, dated Constantinople, 13th May, stated that a vast association connected with the Committee of Union and Progress had been discovered in Constantinople, and that Turkish Nationalists were employing native agents to spread disaffection among the Indian troops there, the obvious methods, such as conversation with and enter-tainment of officers and soldiersun cafes, being adopted.Later in May the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi was noted as having recently received two emissaries from the King of the Hedjaz on an unknown mission.As regards supplies for the Nationalists, there is, in the first place, Italy, whose active complicity is dealt with both under that country itself, under Germany, and in Part II. of this issue : art. &quot;D&apos;Annunzio and Fiume.&quot; Reports written late in April and in the earlier half of May throw out hints from which it might be going teo far to hazard a conjecture regarding the probability of French neutrality in case of a conflagration. In April, however, the Turkish Nationalists were pur-chasing large supplies of American uniforms, hospital stores, &amp;c., to the value of about one million Swiss francs, which were being sold by the French Government at Basle.   These goods were sent through Austria
to the Adriatic and shipped to the Black Sea, nominally for Bulgaria and Roumania. Arms and ammunition were stated to be proceeding by the same route from Switzerland, Italy, and Spain.Certain light was thrown in May on the relations between the French and the Nationalists by a circular telegram dated Angora, 18th February 1920, which was reported to have been sent to Nationalist sub-committees by Mustapha Kemal Pasha, recommending that special attention should be paid to a French civil official who was expected to travel through Anatolia, and instructing Nationalist leaders to inscribe their names in the book of the Committee of Franco-Turkish Friendship,Meanwhile it was reported that French officers at Constantinople deprecated the occupation of the city by the Allies, and stated they were not responsible for it.PERSIA.(*See also the Special Report Notes on the Situation in the Near East.)In - April the Persian Government was believed by the Soviet authorities to be sending a diplomatic mission to Moscow to negotiate with the Bolsheviks. This belief is in apparent contradiction with the recent statements of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in London.The Bolshevist force which occupied Euzeli did so in order to dispose&apos; of the remnants of Denikiu&apos;s fleet which had found refuge there, and which, pace the Bolsheviks, constituted a danger to their command of the Caspian. Orders for the withdrawal of this force, whose further occupation of Resht was merely in the nature of a threatening gesture intended to influence negotiations in London, have been given by the Soviet Government. There&apos; are, however, the most serious reasons for believing that this withdrawal of a military force is only in effect a gesture of concession, as the other was a gesture of aggression. The Soviet Government disclaims responsibility for any individuals who may seek to propagate its doctrines in Persia. There is very little doubt that such individuals have its real, though not avowed, support. The recent creation at Reslit of a local Soviet Republic shows that its agents are active.ARMENIA.There is reason to believe that through Karakhan, the well-known Armenian Bolshevik in the Moscow Foreign Office, the Soviet Govern-ment has induced the Armenian Republic to sacrifice its control. of foreign affairs to the Bolsheviks in return for a guarantee from the Soviet Government of (1) internal independence of the Armenian State, (2) the same territorial concessions as have been promised by the Entente, and (3) military assistance in order to euable it to realise its territorial aspirations. According to the Moscow wireless, an Armenian delegation went to Moscow to conclude peace on these terms.EGYPT.The Nationalist Delegation in Europe.From reliable information it appears that the Egyptian Nationalist: Delegation, which is at present holding conversations with Lord Milner, has come with a programme stubbornly intransigent. The delegates intend to claim complete independence for Egypt and to stipulate that the Sudan shall be placed under Egyptian rule. The Suez Canal, according to their programme, is to be internationalised, but Egypt will1 not give its consent to Alexandria being leased to Britain as a naval base. In return for this abdication of British rights, Egypt, according 0  11343-3 &amp;c 0
to the delegation, is willing to sign an alliance with Great Britain, while remaining outside the British Empire.There is reason to believe that Zagloul Pasha has been working in with the Tashkilat Mahsosa, the head office of which is now at Berlin under the direction of General von Kressenstein. This organisation was formerly a civil section of the Intelligence Department organised by Enver Pasha.Conditions in Egypt.It seems more and more established that the proximate cause of Egyptian troubles is Italy, with Germany in the middle distance. In spite of her own strikes and other economic troubles Italy has her agents in Egypt and through them is reported to be a very real force on the Kile, where they are suffering from the repercussion of foreign propa-ganda by Italian democrats and socialists. Whatever the cause, there is at least no doubt of the fact that unrest has been rife during the past two months in Cairo, where, as well as in other places in Egypt, there have been a number of cases of assassination, successful or attempted, of British officers and soldiers. Pickets and military law can do little against organised sedition and the continual sniping of British youngsters. Our privates have started reprisals and self-arming in spite of orders to the contrary. That bombs are being manufactured locally has been known for some time, k Looting is common, and the diminution of gas lighting is said to have helped the seditionists.According to information from a very reliable source, from 50,000 to 60,000 rifles, ancient and modern, as well as countless ammunition and equipment, are still said to be stowed away in Cairo, even after the last perquisitions. The local police are said to be trafficking in ammunition with the native buyers, rifles of some sorts going at as low a figure as 15s. Mustapha Kharputly, who had his own wireless at Kafr-esh-sheikh, now has a store of all kinds of arms some of the very newest kind out in the desert, while a near relative of the late Khedive (and of the present Sultan) Omar Toussoun, locally &quot; Prince,&quot; has been doing all the late Khedive could have done, had he been there, against us and on behalf of our iate enemies. Others named as working together to our detriment of peace and order are the Cairo lawyer, Ahmed bey Zouffi and one Syed &apos;dli Musawi, brother of the Indian Sheikh el Islam Syed Agha Shushteri-now in India.The loyalty of the Cairo native police in encounters with swiftly appearing and as swiftly dissolving bands of hooligans, aud their pluck iu facing the stones which the roughs hide under their galabiehs and throw with dangerous accuracy, has been noted as the one satisfactory thing in the whole ugly business.Egyptian students, who have been proceeding to Vienna and Berlin in considerable numbers, ask for a visa from the British Consulate in Egypt for Paris. &apos; They then, presumably under direction, proceed to Trieste, where their passports are vised for Berlin and Vienna. When questioned as to why they do not go to England, Paris, or Switzerland to complete their studies, these students say that living is too expensive in all those countries, whereas in Germany, with the low value of the marki they can live for a few pounds a month.lit appears that the Greeks at Port Said have taken to attending Friday morning service in the mosques for the purpose of listening to the political sermons delivered on these occasions. This is noted as new, and may, it is thought, indicate a change of attitude corresponding with the gradually increasing importance of the Greek position in the Eastern Mediterranean.
7. FAR EASTERN STATES. JAPAN.Labour Unrest.The patient, almost Prussian, respect for authority on the part of the workers, and a hitherto almost continual concession of higher wages on the part of capital, make labour unrest in Japan less dangerous than in other couutries. The labourer raises his hat, bows, and holds his breath when a policeman talks to him. Labour troubles are put down with a very high hand, and the majority of the strikers at the critical moment leave their leaders to the tender mercies of the police.As long as high wages are paid, serious labour disturbances are unlikely. When wages are lowered, trouble may be expected. There are indications that something like this may shortly happen. A decline has set in on tho Stock Exchange at Tokio, with the result that values have slumped considerably, and the slump may be used as an excuse for lowering wages. A&apos; certain amount of unrest has already taken place in the Government Arsenal, where demands have been put forward for an 8 instead of a 10 hour day.CHINA.Although Bolshevism in China is on the whole unlikely to meet with much success, there seems little doubt that a good many pro-Bolshevik agents have been at work in the Far East. Their activities appear greatest in Shanghai, but cau also be traced to other large centres like Canton. there have existed for some time societies, unions, &amp;c, based on various forms of eastern Socialism, which are now convenient avenues of approach certainly used by agents of the Soviet Government.Sun Yat Sen, who appears to be the head of the Bolshevik movement in China, finds his opportunity in a widely-scattered discontent with the present corrupt militarism of the Chinese Government,SIBERIA.The idea of creating a Buffer State in the Far East, extending from Trans-Baikal to Vladivostock, is said to have been partly due to Bolshevik initiative under the menace of Japan from the East. The scheme is regarded, however, as not without danger for the Bolsheviks, because it gives the Democrats scope to show their metal to the population. In consequence, the Zemstvo Government in Siberia now appears to be gradually strengthening its position. The Japanese, however, continue to support Semenoff in spite of promises to the contrary on the part of some of their representatives.8. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Labour Prospects and the One Big Union.The Labour situation in Manitoba has, on the whole, been fairly quiet. The most disturbing feature of the last few days has beeu the rapid growth of the One Big Union in Winnipeg.  The influence of Joe R.
Knight, late of Edmonton, is growing formidable. He is recognised as one of the most capable organisers in the service of the One Big Union. After onlv a few days in Winnipeg ho had split the Carpenters&apos; Union there and set on foot a vigorous One Big Union campaign against the internationals. He is now setting out for the more western provinces, and may make trouble in the Alberta coal-fields, where the One Big Union has made little or no progress.Conditions in the lumber industry are very favourable. The industry is reported to be settling down after the late prolonged disturbances. There is an increasing demand for men and the prospects of the One Big Union and the Lumber Workers Industrial Union are not hopeful. Regular agitators, like Christophers, have been driven out of that field.There does not appear to be anyone in the internationals big enough to call the One Big Union bluff, or to attempt to combat the misrepresentations-tions of their local organ, the &quot;One Big Union Bulletin.&quot; Local news-papers are giving a large amount of space to reports emanating from One Big Union sources, and little effort is apparently made to ascertain&apos; the truth of the reports printed. .There are indications that the One Big Union leaders in Vancouver are trying to defeat the sailors&apos; strike with the hope of discrediting craft strikes, and thereby promoting a general strike.&apos; But, on the whole, in British Columbia and Vancouver, strikes appear to have died down, and the labour situation seems to be much more quiet and orderly.The One Big Union is said to be doing well among the loggers in Victoria, but to be making little or no headway in other lines of industry. Its attempts to organise the Chinese have come to nought.There are no agents of the One Big Union, Bolsheviki or Industrial Workers of the World operating in Ottawa, nor do they find favour among the Trades Unions and foreign element.In Alberta the mines are in full blast, the situation is normal, and with a few exceptions, the agitators have left the Grow&apos;s Nest Pass or gone to work.The One Big Union has also had a set back in two meetings at Montreal; at a large meeting of the raincoat makers strong opposition was shown, a number of the speakers denouncing the Union as anarchistic and supporting the International, the idea that the Government dislikes the One Big Union having a very damping effect.J. E. Bird, the Vancouver barrister, who is counsel for the I.W.W., has predicted that the One Big Union will be declared an illegal body. It, however, makes a special appeal to steady men. The Bricklayers&apos; International Organisation withdrew from the Vancouver Trades and Labour Council when the fight commenced between the International and the One Big Union, and left the impression that the International Organisation was becoming too expensive for ordinary men. they have admitted that the One Big Union principles suit them better than the International; that collective bargaining had taken the place of craft&apos; bargaining, and that if it were nor for the Red Army element that dominated the One Big Union they would be willing to take a chance with the iip.av organisation. &apos; &apos;The executive of the Dominion Trades Labour Congress has issued a stiitement to Trades Unionists in Canada denouncing the propaganda of the extremists ranged under the leadership of .the Oue Big Union.. They say that the Winnipeg strike leaders met with a fair trial and the sentences they received can only&apos; be reviewed with au eye to the possibility&apos; that clemency may be exercised.
Iii Ontario current opinion, among the real Canadian element of labour, is that it would be a very great mistake if the Winnipeg men are released from gaol at the present time.Threatened labour troubles on the Miramiehi River have been smoothed over owing to the course taken by the Officer Commanding the Maritime Provinces. The strikes were largely due to the feeling in the neigh -bourhood against the export of raw pulp wood, which it is considered could be manufactured into paper On the Miramichi River and not, as now, in the United States.The American Federation of Labour Convention has adopted a resolu-tiou indicating disapproval of Russian Soviet rule, and has decided to refuse to endorse the resolutions urging the United States to resume trade with Russia.Influx of Miners from the United Kingdom.It is reported that considerable numbers of miners from England and Wales are coming into the country to work in the coal mines of Western Canada. Carl Berg, J. F. Maguire and other radicals, iu and near Edmonton, are reported to be buying rifles.In Saskatchewan activities in connection with the alien unrest, pro-paganda, and revolutionary matters have been more or less sit a standstill during the mouth.Membership for Negroes..&apos; At its Convention in Montreal the American Federation of Labour adopted a resolution requesting the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks to eliminate the colour line from its Constitution and give negroes full membership. There was a stormy argument and several delegates spoke heatedly against the admission of negroes. Action is being taken to get all Unions to admit coloured workers.The Irish Question. .      ,The Canadian Branch of the American Federation of Labour again threatens to interfere iu the Irish question, although many of the Canadian delegates, other than those of Irish descent, object to American organisations meeting in and enjoying the hospitality of the Metropolis of a British Dominion and passing resolutions interfering in British domestic affairs. Should the resolutions with regard to Irish problems be pre-sented, the Canadian delegates, other thau Irish, may withdraw from the Convention until the debate is ended.British Columbia.A. P. Warrington of Krotona, who is probably the most prominent of the Besantine Theosophists in the US.A., proposes to accompany Mr. B. P. WadiaAo India. Under his lead the American section adopted the Besantine policy of introducing the Indian Home Rule agitation into theosophical affairs.&quot; &quot; The Messenger,&quot; the organ of the American section of the Besantine Theosophists, devotes considerable space to Indian Home Rule topics, while, on the other hand, mischievous circulars are issued by Indians to the Labour Party and to members of the One Big Union, especially to the Lumber Workers&apos; section in Vancouver.During his tour in British Columbia in the early part of the year, Mr.&apos; Tom Richardson, ex-M.P., spoke at several meetings of the Federated Labour Party, describing himself as a Socialist and Internationalist. He declared that the country was further from democracy than before the
war, deprecated &quot; direct action&quot; aud inveighed bitterly against the Canadian press, which, he said, was more corrupt and more under the influence of capital than that of England.AUSTRALIA.Extremists.The Bolshevik movement in Australia has not assumed important dimensions. The T.W.W. has not revived since the Unlawful Associa-tions Act was passed, but the remnants of the old organisations have formed. new societies under various other names and without disclosing any objects of association which might be considered unlawful.Two societies in Sydney the Industrial Labour Party and the International Industrial Workers are purely revolutionary, but, although the leaders are knowu as ex-l.W.W. men, sufficient evidence has not yet been obtained against them. It is hoped that, with the advent of the new peace legislation concerning immigration, it will be possible to deal, with any individuals who advocate or encourage direct action in Australia by repatriating them.The only body that has solidly declared in favour of Bolshevism is the Russian Association, of which the more militant members have been put out of the country.The Prince of Wales and Sinn Fein.Sinn I^eiu influences entirely failed to prejudice the Prince of Wales&apos;s tour through Victoria, though particular efforts were to be made to mar the Queensland demonstrations. The Teachers&apos; Executive of Brisbane decided not to co-operate, as a body, in arranging a children&apos;s loyal display, but that each teacher should be free to follow his own iuclina-tions.Sinn .Fein efforts to prevent the deportation of Germans interned during the War only exasperate loyalty everywhere.The resolution passed by the House of Representatives in favour of increasing the salaries of members from 600/. to 1,000/. a year has caused intense indignation, and politicians who joined in the Royal procession when the Prince of Wales landed were the object of a hostile demonstra-tiou. ,The proposed increase has led the miners in the Collie coalfield to demand an increase of 60 per cent, in their wages also.Strikes.The gas workers at Melbourne and neighbouring towns have ;ceased work demanding an immediate large increase in wages. Half a milliou people are left without means of cooking. The public services are paralysed and no electric trains are running.The Government has intervened in the strike in view of the import-ance: of maintaining the gas supplies for industrial purposes, aud Mr. Lawson, Premier of Victoria, has appealed, for volunteers to replace the strikers, and has established a national service bureau.The remaining gas supplies are to be rationed for hospitals and similar, institutions. The men have been offered 13s. a day, but they demand 14s. The strike has extended to the lumpers, who refused to handle coal intended for the gas workers.The meat exporters- have acceded to the men&apos;s terms, with the object of saving 1,500,000/. worth of meat, now iu cold storage belonging to the Imperial Government.
The tramway employees in Melbourne ceased work on 25th May owing to the Tramway Board&apos;s refusal to grant double rates during the Prince of Wales&apos; visit.   The railwaymen made the same demand.The building Trade Unions in Tasmania have passed a resolution not to work more than 44 hours a week.The coal miners&apos; Federation has proposed that the Broken Hill Mines should be taken over by the Government of New South Wales.Miscellaneous.The New South Wales Labour Government is holding an inquiry on the character of the evidence adduced in the case of 12 members of the I.W.W. who were sentenced, in 1916, to periods of from 10 to 15 years&apos; imprisonment on charges of causing arson in Sydney, attempting to get Tom Barker out of gaol illegally, and seditious conspiracy.A campaign to secure their release has been opened in England by Tom Barker, the Australian Workers&apos; Defence Committee delegate.A special journal, called &quot; Soviet Russia,&quot; published in Sydney by Peter Semenoff (see May Report), to inform the inhabitants of Australia concerning the situation in Russia has caused the Communist movement in Australia to grow, and resulted in several strikes and protests.SOUTH AFRICA.Political.The Native Affairs Bill, which has been read a second time, recog-uises that the natives of the Union are, as a whole, voiceless,, and makes an effort to call into being organic constitutions which will make the natives feel they are given a voice in influencing public policy.During the debate Mr. Van Hees, one of the younger Nationalist members, declared that the native policy of the Transvaal and the Orauge Free State was that the whole native question must be approached purely from the standpoint of protecting the white man, and must not be guided by the principle of justice to the native. He urged the complete elimination of European influences from the native governance in Southern Africa, ealling for the eradication of Portugal from Mozam-bique, of Belgium from the Congo, of the Charter from Rhodesia, and of Great Britain from the Protectorates.This programme was characterised by another member as one of frank, brutal Prussianism, which, if it ever could be applied, would spell the disappearance of the white man from South Africa.There has been a rapid growth of Bantu National Consciousness from Cape Town to Tanganyika, and if the growing sense of unity among the Bantu peoples is to be directed into channels offering no menace to European civilization, it can only be along such lines as General Smuts has adumbrated. Mr. Van Hees&apos;s policy would consolidate against the European race a hostile and sullen Bantu nationality constantly awaiting an opportunity to strike.The National Socialist League openly used the election platforms to educate the natives on revolutionary lines; in consequence, there, has been trouble in the form of boycotting concession stores and of demands for higher wages, and a general strike at an early date is under discussion.The &quot;Colour Bar.&quot;The question of white and coloured labour is a difficult one. In the past the &quot; colour bar &quot;has been accepted without very serious question, by the natives, but in the last few years constant contact with the effect
of.white labour movements has had a marked educational effect. White labour is almost wholly some form of superintendence, and native labour constitutes the manual work on which all operation of the minesdepends. ......... -The native now aspires to the skilled work which carries higher pay. &apos; In a recent strike of natives the organisers of trouble adopted trade union methods of picketing and rough handling of &quot; black-legs.&quot;The Premium on Gold.In many mines working now on a small margin there is a limit plainly within sight to the wages which can be paid. The limit of possible working would have been passed already in the cases of some of the poorer mines if the premium on gold had not temporarily removed the boundary line. - The advantages to Africa, and to industry in England, of working as low a grade of ore as possible is very evident, but as increase in wages does not increase output---and indeed often does the reverse it is quite clear that a continuance of some unreasonable recent labour demands will materially change conditions in the gold mining industry.The following figures based on a single month&apos;s operation of the Brakpan mine are interesting. There were 43,000 tons of ore milled, and it is calculated that white and native labour in Africa, and labour in other countries on the stores and materials used, received 58,734/. in wages, that is, the total labour cost was about 27*. 3d. per ton of ore milled. The yield of gold was 19,130 ounces, so that labour received 61*.- 5d. out.of each ounce of gold obtained, and the normal value of the ounce is 85*. The total cost per ton or per ounce is, of course, increased by administration, office expenses, taxes, Government share of profit, and raw-material, cost of the stores and supplies consumed.- It is, therefore, perfectly evident that unless the grade of every ton of ore will yield in gold considerably more than the 27*. 3d. paid to labour alone, such a mine working at this cost would have to close, and white aud native labour would have to go elsewhere for a living.The-premium on gold is considered by many authorities to be itself a temporary condition, dependent on abnormal exchange between the principal/ countries of the world, but the earners of wages do not want to admit that a standard of pay once reached can be reduced by reason of a little thing like the reduction in the selling price of the product.The Communist Party and the Extremists.The Communist party of South Africa has been formed by the Jewish sections of the International Workers and the International Socialists. This new party claims to be opposed to the International Socialists and the Labour party, who it declares have become corrupt by reason of the subsidies from the capitalists. Andrew Dunbar, the President, advocates the Soviet form of government for South Africa and the abolishment of all parliaments. He appealed to the &apos; Jews to standby their Communist leaders during the forthcoming crisis, as they, the Jews, had far more spirit than the ordinary working man,, and were not averse to causing trouble when they saw a convenient opportunity.1 , .....Bolshevik views are openly preached by the Industrial Socialist League, whose President is a Russian Jew named Buruian.   Propaganda&apos; work, more particularly directed towards coloured and native classes, is carried on, and the league appears to have ample funds, the source of which is unknown.   They have recently become affiliated with the
Soviet Council in Moscow. They do not appear to be making much headway at present, but might become dangerous in. the event of ^a strike. ; -  - ....... ^; &apos;. iThe shop stewards system, at present in force in the various craft unions in South Africa, is claimed to be the nearest approach to. the Russian Soviet system of government.At a meeting of the Communist party William MacLean stated that a great many of the police were with them heart aud soul, as they, the police, were underpaid and their families half starved and insufficiently clothed. &apos;        :  -Nationalisation of Mines.The South African Industrial Federation has passed a resolution demanding the nationalisation of gold and coal mines, and threatens drastic action if government does hot agree.Miscellaneous.: A society called &quot; De Vereeniging Zuid Afrikaansche Voorschot Kas-&quot; (the Union of South Africa Credit Bank), of which Dr. Mansveldt is secretary, is actively engaged in advancing sums of money to suitable applicants for tho purpose of assisting Dutch subjects to settle in&apos;South Africa, and so strengthen the Dutch element in the Union.The South African Industrial Federation will join in the boycott of Hungary.AFRICA.Liberia.The headquarters of the Universal Negro Improvement Association is, to be transferred to Monrovia, Liberia, immediately after t]ie Negro Convention in August. This is hailed by the &quot; Negro World &quot; as &quot;the first constructive step in the programme of a free and redeemed Africa.&quot; The Universal Negro Improvement Association claims to control 2,000,000 natives of Liberia, and the heads of the Liberian branch, are&apos; the dnefs of the various tribes.According to a speaker at a meeting of the Universal Negro Improve -ment Association the negroes are deserting Republicanism,and Demo-democracy, and their overwhelming sentiment is now unmistakably in the direction of Racialism. He attacked the Soviet representatives of Harlem, whose purpose was, he said, to deliver the negro bound and gagged to the Socialist party.9. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.General.There is no change of policy vis a vis the Soviet Government. The administration is opposed to opening trade relations with Russia at present.Eugene V. Debs, who is now serving a 10 years&apos;sentence for violation of the espionage law, has been nominated by the Socialist Party, by. acclamation, for the Presidency of the United States. Debs has already made four attempts to reach the White House.The Chamber of Commerce of New York has adopted a resolution urging the Government not to recognise the Soviet. Acting on orders from President Wilson, the State Department has formally refused to grant passports to the Committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce appointed to visit Russia with a view to establishing&quot; trade
relations. America will not necessarily be bound by the result of the negotiations between Krassin and Lloyd George, but officials declared that the United States was to be represented unofficially at the conference in London between Krassin and representatives of the Supreme Economic Council.An accusation of illegal acts, persecution, and cruelty by the Depart-ment of Justice officials in the recent campaign against the alleged Radicals has been made by 12 prominent lawyers in Washington, in the form of .&quot; A Report upon the Illegal Practices of the U.S. Department of Justice.&quot; This account is supported by affidavits and exhibits. It refers to the alleged use of agents-provocateurs.It is reported from Washington that President Wilson had signed a Bill to amend the deportation law so as to make it possible to deport Germans and other aliens interned in the United States.Labour.The General Executive Board of the Industrial Workers of the World has adopted a resolution on the subject of sabotage, in which they declare that their organisation does not now believe, and never has advocated destruction or violence as means of accomplishing industrial reform.The programme of the American Federation of Labour, which opened on 7th June, included, among other resolutions, the impeachment of Mr. Palmer, the Attorney-General, the right to strike, and the condemn a-tion of coercion in the case of Mexico. The Mexican clause carefully avoids a strike threat, while mentioning outrages and insults to the United States, which, &quot; if true, would justify immediate war.&quot; Mr. Gompers urged labour to use its forces and influences in moderation, but said that any attempts to make labour compulsory by enactment forbidding strikes must be resisted at all costs.The Republican platform upholds the &quot;right of collective bargaining for labour, but makes no mention of strikes, except to deny the principle of compulsory arbitration, while denouncing the strike of Government employees. The Irish plank was finally omitted, a decision which came as a severe blow to the Irish leaders.Extremists.An attempt to force the Socialist Party of America to adhere unreservedly to the Third (Moscow) International has failed, as the National Socialist Convention has voted in favour of re-affirming its allegiance to the Second International, with reservations, including that of, determining its own national policy.According to a declaration of the National Executive Committee of the Communist Labour Party, &quot; the differences between the Communist &quot; Labour Party and the Socialist Party are fundamental ones and there is &quot; no common ground for unity.&quot; The Socialist Party aims at the capture of the capitalist state, and the operation of its machinery in the name of the workers, whereas the Communist Labour&apos;Party aims at, not the capture, but the destruction of the capitalist state, and the setting up in its place of a proletarian dictatorship as an instrument of the proletarian revolution.Robert Baldwin, who is directly connected with the International movement, is closely connected with Robert Brnere, one of the signa-torles to.the call of the Committee of 48.  Mrs. Robert Bruere helped
to obtain funds to defend the Hindus indicted under the Espionage Act in 1919.   .The Dutch Communist Party has received notice that a new secret newspaper called Komoenista has been founded in the United States of America. This paper is the organ of the Polish section of the Com-raunist Party in the United States, and is published in New York.Jim Larkin, who sent the cablegram which caused the transport workers to go on strike and so brought about the release of the 92 prisoners, is anxious to be deported as soon as possible as he feels sure that were he imprisoned in England a general strike would be called demanding his release.Francis Hackett left New York for Scandinavia at the end of May and is travelling in the interest of Jim Larkin&apos;s defeuce, to give his case the necessary publicity in Ireland and to obtain money for the appeal. Hackett is co-edilor of the New York weekly The New Republic, and is Hearst&apos;s political lobbyist and agent.About 4,000 of the railway employees in the Chicago yards belong to &quot; One Big Union,&quot; and are planning for a strike in January.Communism.It is reported that 85 per cent, of the Communists are ready to go over to the Communist Labour Party, the chief objection being that the Communist Labour Party goes underground. Americans themselves insist on working out in the open, though they have no objection if the foreign branches prefer underground work. The members, of the Com-munist Labour Party who are opposed to &quot; underground work &quot; have been warned by the Executive Secretary of the Central Committee not to be too sure of the effect of . Secretary Wilson&apos;s statement regarding the legality of the Communist Labour Party, and have been urged to use even greater caution than before.International Labour Day stamps were sold on 1st May to provide money for propaganda purposes. Four Communist Saturdays a year are to be celebrated by the party, and are to be occupied solely in work for its benefit.A split has occurred within the Communist Party, and its leaders have brought charges against Nicholas Gourwitch, also a member of the National Committee, accusing him of forging a mandate from the Executive Committee of the Communist Party and collecting money upon that mandate from the branches of the party throughout the United States. Gourwitch did forge the mandate with Ruthenberg&apos;s signature and kept the money for his own purpose. The party has divided fairly equally, but Ruthenberg carried with him the more important members.The fight between Mr. Martens&apos; Russian Soviet Bureau and the Communist Party is becoming more and more aggravated. Martens, through his confidential mau, Nuorteva, who is the master-mind of the Russian Soviet Bureau in the United States, has brought indirect charges against the majority of the leaders of the Communist party, accusing them of being agents of the United States Government. These charges are not considered worthy of credence by the Third International.Bolshevik activity.Bolshevist propaganda written in Hungarian, which has been printed in the United States of America, has reached the Dutch Communist offices in Holland. Great secrecy has been observed by Wynkoop in this matter, and so far it has not been discovered exactly how these pamphlets
arrive in Europe. The intermediaries are members of -the Dutch Transport Federation who have the pamphlets fetched at Copenhagen, presumably by Dutch sailors. One pamphlet bears the badge of the I.W.W.Bolshevik propaganda is declared to be losing ground, as its fallacies become clearer to its former victims. The Executivo Council of the American Federation of Labour favours the establishment of voluntary conference boards in order .to induce co-operation between employers and workers as a means of curbing profiteering, and suggests that the control of credit be taken from private financiers and placed in the hands of a public agency to be administered by voluntary aud co-operative methods. The report of the Executive Council declares that the workers are as willing to work as ever, that productive capacity is great, and that the influences which are checking production are under the control of the employers and not of the workers.Bolshevism among Teachers.A certain percentage of the teaching personnel&apos;of many of the colleges and universities is affected by Bolshevism, and, while these people are negligible in number, the effect which they exert upon the minds of their students is most dangerous. Powerful organisations have been set up by influential people throughout the country to combat this danger by teaching Americanism.The publication of a pamphlet by the Department of Justice exposing the Radical programme and its criminal nature, as part and parcel of the Russian Bolshevist plot directed against the existing order both in Europe and America, has had an excellent effect in influential quarters.Anti-Bolshevik feeling in America.There has been a marked popular, reaction against Bolshevism in the United States during the last three months.American public opinion is overwhelmingly for laAv, order, and evolution, as the safe process for industrial reform, and for a firm repression of all &quot; social treasons.&quot;State after State has enacted severe laws for the punishment of sabotage, criminal syndicalism, and sedition generally, and there have been hundreds of effective prosecutions.:Raids, begun in November 1919 and continued in January 1920, together with numerous prosecutions of Radicals by authorities of individual States, have resulted in suppressing almost entirely the Communist movement., so far as open manifestations are concerned. Revolutionary propaganda is, however, still carried on by the Radical press owing to the lack of adequate laws for its governance. Such literature however carries little weight: outside the narrow circle of Bolshevik intelligeuza and , in the ranks of radically disposed labour, which constitute a comparatively small proportion, of the vast - industrial population.    ,;v This small proportion is, notwithstanding, well organised and its covert activities in promoting discontent aiid in intriguing for control of the labour unions are great. It is assisted in its agitation by financial aid from wealthy Radical perverts and from abroad. The disaffection of American, labour towards a more favourable reception of the ultra-Radical ideal,is, evident, and the latter, while still a minority movement, is an&apos; unpleasant sign of what might happen should the nation lose its.present condition of ^business prosperity. . - -
A feeliug that constructive industrial reforms are necessary and practicable is pretty general. A statement of these would include the establishment of industrial courts for the handling of labour-capital disputes, recognition of the right of collective bargaining, better laws for the prevention of excess profits and unearned fortunes, and, most impor-tant of all, ratification of the Peace Treaty, so that America may take its proper position of prominence toward restoration of International tran-quility. A comprehensive programme of reconstruction will undoubtedly be developed during the June convention,Irish Agitation.&quot;The Boycotting of England &quot; was discussed lately at a meeting of the &quot; Irish Progressive League.&quot; The League of Alliance, which corresponds very closely to the workings of the Committee of 48, is very&apos; much interested in this, question, and will lend both financial and moral support to any movement which may be started. iIt has been decided that all goods coming from Ireland must be marked as such, and not as coming from England. Manufacturers of linen in the United States, who have been calling their products &quot;Irish&apos; linen,&quot; will be persuaded to change this name.Members of the Progressive Irish League are being placed in useful positions, which will enable them to carry on propaganda, such as teachers in public schools, trained nurses, city inspectors, &amp;c.&quot; The Free Irish Trade Union League,&quot; started by Jim Larkin and&apos; Mrs. Brody, and composed of all the Irish Trade Unionists, has been formed, to send delegates or representatives out among the longshoremen and workers on the docks to provoke strikes. It was decided to ask the men to refuse to unload cargoes coming from England until the English evacuate Ireland, and the British Labour Party was asked to call a general strike until the British troops leave Ireland.During a sitting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on 28th May, a resolution was introduced declaring in the interests of Anglo-American friendship that the Irish question is &quot;no concern of the United States,&quot; although Mr. Colby, Secretary of State, had written that: &quot;Nothing connected with the foreign relations &quot; of the United States should deter the Committee from any action it &quot; felt impelled to take regarding American recognition of the Irish &quot; Republic.&quot;Mr. de Valera has been warned that he must not attempt to dictate . to the American people, and is. to be compelled to leave America because of his interference with Irish-Americans. He has also been accused of misappropriating funds subscribed by Irish-Americans for use in Ireland only, and using them to influence the Irish Convention. Mr. de. Valera . contends that the money belongs to the Irish nation, which can sanction its expenditure for &quot; all legitimate governmental purposes,&quot; and that he had the full authority of the &quot; Irish Government&quot; to use it as he thought best.It is said that many prominent leaders of the Irish movement -are -becoming citizens of both the United States of America and the Irish Republic in order to be able to ask the United States for aid if ever England unjustly detains them.   Both de Valera and Mr. Lynch are , said to possess this dual citizenship.
10. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES.An International Convention between the Governments of Argentine, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uraguay was signed ad referendum by their representatives on 29th February in Buenos Aires. The police authorities of the respective countries undertake to furnish each other with information likely to assist in the suppression of crime and to exchange data concerning individuals dangerous to society.A counter project presented by the representative of the Government of Brazil, proposed an agreement for the exclusion of undesirable persons^ by legislative measures, the joint convention to stipulate the form in which these should he enacted.It appeared improbable that the Uruguayan Congress would accept the Convention signed ad referendum in its preseut form, and the Uruguayan Government has in fact broken off negotiations pending with the Argentine, Brazil, &amp;c.ARGENTINE.Extremists.There has been no evidence of any determined official policy directed against strikes and Bolshevism in general, and, as a matter of fact, it was considered by business houses that the Government was aiding and abetting the strikers. Bolshevism and anarchism were being preached everywhere and a general uprising prepared for 1st May. The capitalists and the middle classes had to take strenuous steps to safeguard their interests and maintain law and order. They patrol the streets, break up meetings, and do any counter-strike work as ordered by the hurriedly-formed Masters&apos; Union (La Associacion de Trabajo) and the Workmen&apos;s Congress of the &quot; Liga Patriotica Argentina.&quot;An Anarchist plot has been discovered by the Governor of the Province of Mendoza. The Chamber has been closed, many arrests made, and a number of bombs and rifles seized at the residence of a Russian who was organising the upheaval.A kind of Russian Soviet was established lately at Irigoyen by a group of criminals, who were levying contributions on local farmers and labourers under threat of personal violence and the destruction of crops and buildings. The ringleaders of the movement were arrested, and the police secured documents relating to sums collected.Enrique Garcia Thomas, a Spaniard, has been condemned to six years imprisonment on a charge of being concerned in the production of the Anarchist paper &quot; Bandera Roja.&quot; The first issue of &quot; La Dandera del Pueblo&quot; has been seized by the police, and a number of suspects connected with it were arrested.American Trade.The British loan of 50,000,000 dollars has made an excellent impression from &quot; high official circles&quot; down to the man in the street. It is considered &quot; real friendly and sporting.&quot;Immigration.Immigration is on the increase ; 800 immigrants landed recently, 250 of whom had funds to acquire land or property. Increasing numbers are also arriving from Spain, France, Austria, Germany, and the Balkans, all with capital. .
At a recent meeting at the German Club it was decided to cable to Germany to discourage immigration to the Argentine, as being unsuitable for labourers and clerks. Only those with capital were advised to go there.According to a German there were in March over 2,000 newly arrived Germans without either employment or private means, who were compelled to exist on relief funds provided by their compatriots.There is no trace of any organisation for German Colonisation and Immigration.Strikes.The threat of a general strike has been abortive, partly because the ringleaders are known to the police and partly because the various trade unions are insufficiently organised to act as a coherent whole. As 90 per cent, of the men are really satisfied the deportation of some 200 agitators, many of whom are Spanish, would put an end to the &quot;worst features of the present situation.The Chief of Police, General Broquem, has a reputation for uncompromising firmness in dealing with violence on the part of strikers, and since he came into office a few months ago there have been practically no disturbances in the town.All labour abandoned work on 1 st May with the exception of those engaged in public services, eg., trains, trams, &amp;c, and even these were halted for five minutes at mid-day. A few stones were thrown at passing trams, but apart from this the day passed as au ordinary holiday.*CHILE.A revolutionary scheme was started last year to set on foot a Soviet Government in Northern Chile with headquarters in Antofagasta, the centre of advanced Socialist ideas in Chile. The Government took drastic action, broke up the printing press of the &quot;Socialista&quot; (the leading Socialist paper in Chile) and deported the agitators to the Southern provinces. At the beginning of this year, however, these men were all repatriated and even compensated by the Government. In consequence, agitation has started again in Antofagasta.
PART IL1. BOLSHEVISM AND ISLAM.The connection of Turkish Nationalists anrl Pan-Islamists with Russia,Up to quite recently a six months&apos; investigation at Constantinople had brought to light no connection between the Turks and the Bol-sheviks. It was discovered, however, that in Asia Minor tentative pourparlers had been afoot between Mustapha Kemal Pasha and emis-saries of the Soviet Government, and a Bolshevik organisation at Panderma appeared to be endeavouring to come to some sort of Avorking agreement Avith the Nationalists, But even in this case the impression was that attempts to come to a real understanding or agreement with the Turks had not been serious. Mutual distrust on either part seemed to lead to unwillingness on the part of both Nationalists and Bolsheviks to be bound by any real agreement, and to a preference for a kind of loose entente, whereby the two parties might help each other Avithout incurring definite responsibility or going too far.On the whole, while it was admitted that further east, in the Caucasus and Transcaspia, the chances of a rapprochement were great, it Avas considered that, in Asia Minor at least, it was improbable that the Bolsheviks would.look with favour on agreements Avhich would bind them to the Turkish Nationalists, or even to the Pan-Islamists. Definite signs of Bolshevik organisations in Constantinople were difficult to detect, though tendencies and sympathies among the&apos; Turks, Levantines, and Europeans in Constantinople were noted which might be taken to foreshadow a fusion with Bolshevism, and which might end,&quot; directly or indirectly, morally or materially, in aiding the Bolshevik cause to British detriment.While this Avas the general impression to be gained in Constantinople itself, an instance Avhich aroused a suspicion uoav proved to have been Avell founded came to light, when, on 6th May, the official Turkish Nationalist organ, Hakim-i-Millie, announced that two delegates from the Nationalist Assembly Avere leaviug to negotiate with the Bolsheviks in Moscow, Avhere the arrival of Mustapha Effendi aud Tewfik Bey was announced in a Moscow telegram dated 8th May. It Avas added that they were continually at the Foreign Office and War Commissariat, aud at the same time constantly in touch with the Caucasus.An exact account of what followed Avas received from a most reliable source towards the middle of June.At the end of May a secret conference was held in the Foreign Office at Moscow betAveen the leading Bolshevik Commissars and representatives from Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Tndia, and other countries.The Russian Commissars present at the meeting were Lenin, Tchitcherin, Karakhan, Radek, Kalenin, and General Kameneff; both Bravin and Dr. Suritz were specially recalled from Turkestan and Afghanistan respectively to attend. Vornozenski, Director of the Eastern Section, was also present.The Turkish delegates were Tewfik Bey and Mustapha Eflendi, Enver Pasha is also reported to have been present.
The object of the conference was to discuss combined political and military action against the Entente and especially against England. Bravin and Dr. Suritz&apos;s reports on the situation in the Near and Middle East were listened to with great interest.   Bravin said : &quot; Bolshevism falls on fertile soil amongst the followers of Islam. Our doctrines please them on account of the principle of equality which we preach. Islamites are willing to take up Bolshevism provided it is in a national form as they desire to preserve their nationalities.&quot; British influence is very powerful in the East, but it has now been pierced in several places, and if we can only unite there may be a chance of breaking England&apos;s power.&quot; The Islamites look upon Russia with favour, as they are convinced that Bolshevism has no imperialistic tendencies, but, on the contrary, protects the weaker nations. This attitude is due to our vigorous propaganda among them.&quot;&apos; A long discussion followed, and then Lenin made a speech.   He said : &quot; England is our greatest enemy in the world. British imperialism is a pest which spreads everywhere. The French are Jess dangerous, as they are Chauvinists, and do not travel much beyond their own frontiers. Let us look at what is happening in Caucasia. To begin with, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan were against us, and even asked the Entente for help. England only responded. She understood that there was a&apos; new field opening for her exploitation. As soon as Caucasia severed herself from Russia it became a &apos; No Man&apos;s Land,&apos; open to any nation which cared to rob it. England has now commenced to do this. At Baku she started to &apos; organise.&apos; She even wished * to make Batum an independent State and at the same time to export her riches.&quot; Luckily the inhabitants of Caucasia have begun to realise that in separating from Russia she &apos; fell out of the frying pan into the fire.&apos; They now see that European adventurers are not there to protect, but to exploit and rob them. Even charming Italy has not been able to resist the temptation, and has now commenced a general system of robbery.&quot; The Caucasian Republics have appealed to us for protection against the robbers. Azerbaijan and Georgia have concluded peace with us, and Armenia may do likewise at any moment. Baku is in our hands and Batum will soon fall; naturally our friends the Turks have helped us.&quot; It is not for us, however, to take back what formerly belonged to Russia.   Our task is to root out the British imperialistic spirit in Turkey, Persia, and Asia generally.   In India we must strike them hardest.   If we understand how to act, this task should not 1    be difficult.&quot;Several other delegates then spoke, among whom were many military experts and leaders of propaganda.At the conclusion of the conference a secret treaty was signed between the following : Soviet Russia; the Government of Mustapha Kemal Pasha ; representatives of the National Bolsheviks in Persia and Georgia; Soviet representatives of Azerbaijan; National Bolshevik delegates of Armenia, Turkestan, and Afghanistan; representatives of the national revolutionary movement in India.0 11343-3 &amp;e D
2. THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN SPAIN.A Spanish Communist party, adherent to the Third International, and more specially affiliated to the Western Bureau at Amsterdam, under Wynkoop, Rutgers, and Roland Hoist, was officially founded on 15th April, in Madrid, by the organisation of the &quot; Juventudes Socialistas Espanoles,&quot; the organ of which body, hitherto called &quot; Renovacion,&quot; becomes &quot; El Communista.&quot;The new party is certainly making headway and is said to be expect-ing, financial help from Russia. Marino Garcia and Daniel Aguiano,* both complete extremists, are its leaders. Marino Garcia is its banker, and his house in Madrid, Juan Pradilla 20, is the meeting place of the party, which has issued a manifesto making an appeal to the Left of the Socialist party to split off and join its ranks. It is alsbin relation with the &quot; Juventude Syndicalista &quot; (Young Syndicalists). A congress, which does not yet appear to have materialised, was to take place in May, at which the Communist Association of Madrid was to be represented by two. Socialists, two Anarchists, and two Young Syndicalists.  Anguianp* See R.B. for April, under Holland. This man was arrested by the Dutch police when he went to Holland, ostensibly to attend the Second International, but in reality to get into touch with Wynkoop. The Dutch police released him after the Spanish Minister had rather mysteriously intervened on his behalf,Amongst the paragraphs of the treaty, the following may be quoted: ]   (1) The parties agree to help each other with officers, troops, arms,and money. 0(2) None of the parties acknowledge the Treaty of Versailles.They undertake to fight for its revision. (3) There is no objection to any one party concluding&apos; a separate peace with the Entente, provided the interests of the other parties are safeguarded. (4) Independence of Caucasian Republics is acknowledged, but onlyon the assumption that they join the Russian Confederation. (5) Mustapha Kemal Pasha pledges himself, in the event of hisgaining power, to recognise the independence of Armenia. (6) Soviet Russia declares her disinterested policy towards european and Asiatic Turkey, on condition that the Dardanelles remainfree for navigation, and the forts are razed to the ground. (7) Constantinople to remain in Turkish hands. (8) The Soviet Government and the other parties pledge them-selves to support Turkey in the re-establishment of her rights in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.   Smyrnamust be taken from the Greeks and returned to Turkey.. (9) The rights of minorities are recognised. (10) The parties undertake to help Persia, and, after the Englishhave been driven out, &quot;the Russian and Turkish troops will be withdrawn.(11) Boundary questions between Turkey and Persia to be settled by arbitration. The parties to this treaty to have seats on the Arbitration Commission.     *(12) National movement in India to be encouraged and assisted in every way.(13) All the parties promise to put.no hindrance in the way of Bolshevik propaganda in their respective countries.
was to take the chair. The action of the party was to be modelled upon ,the recent programme at Sarragosa, and delegates were to be sent through to get into touch with the prime movers in that city.The &quot; Juventudes Socialistas Espanoles&quot; at their last National Congress declared without reserve for the Third International. These &quot;Jeunesses&quot; were the spirit of the Spanish Communists in the Socialist party, where, though the mass was undoubtedly revolutionary, the leaders were generally opportunist. Except Anguiano, in fact, who was secretary of the party, the Left wing was held to have no true Communist leaders and the &quot; Jeunesses &quot; accused men like Mariano Garcia Cortes, Manuel Numez de Arenas, Cesar Gonzalez, Jose Lopez y Lopes and Ramon Lamoneda, of working in collaboration with what they&apos; term the reactionary politicians of the party against the ideals of the Third International. Garcia Cortes was noted actually to have brought forward in the reunion of the party the argument that Soviet Russia itself was temporising, a demagogy condemned as treason to the Third Inter-national. The same was stated to apply to Nunez de Arenas, Lamoneda and others, who actually went so far astray as to vote for Fadra Ribas, a political friend of Renaudel, as director of the party&apos;s daily newspaper &quot; El Socialista.&quot; Such men, the &quot; Jeunesses &quot; held, could not be trusted by the Communists. Mariano Garcia aud Daniel Anguiano, however, were conceived to have proved by their acts that they intended to conform to the principles of the Third International, and in consequence they alone were allowed to contribute to the organisation of the Com-munist party.The &quot; Jeunesses &quot; claim to have about 10,000 members, but they count on the rapid adhesion of numerous elements in the Socialist party -and believe that in less than a year the tail will be able to wag the dog. It claims to have local organisations covering nearly the whole of Spain and originating from the fusion of the groups of the &quot; Jeunesses &quot; with other local groups similarly minded. They have also a propaganda committee directly in touch with the Provisional Executive Committee of the Communist party. In April four propagandists were said to be travelling through Spain. The members of the Provisional Executive Committee were Merino Garcia, Esteban, Anrade, Rodriguez, Portela, Illexas, Buendia, Ugarte, and Pico, and Comrade Rutgers of the &quot;Auxiliary Office &quot; of the Communist International at Amsterdam had sent to its organisers a letter of greeting.3. D&apos;ANNTJNZXO AND ANTI-BRITISH INTRIGUE IN FIUME.The situation in Fiume was reported at the beginning of June to be getting worse every day. D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s position is Very much shaken. The wellrknown affray between Carabinieri and Arditi divided the Fiume population into two parties. It is stated that when D&apos;Annunzio expelled the Carabinieri from Fiume, some of the Arditi would not let them leave the town. This would account for the fight which took place in the streets.Food is very scarce. There is a large quantity of coffee in the town, which was &quot; requisitioned&quot; by D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s men some months ago, when they captured a steamer bound to Yugo-Slavia. There is also a fair amount of wheat, but meat is hardly ever to be obtained ; milk is also very scarce.D&apos;Anuunzio cannot sell the coffee which he seized from Yugo-Slavia for money to carry on his little court. In order to raise funds it was suggested that he might sell the &quot; Dante Alighieri&quot; to the Argentine
52if:Republic. This transaction did uot, however, meet with the approval of the Italian Government.The Italian Government is undoubtedly backing up D&apos;Annunzio, in spite of the numerous facts which would tend to show the contrary. A regular courier travels from Fiume to Rome, via Ancona, and vice versa. In Rome he generally puts up at the Hotel d&apos;Angleterre, Bocca di Leone.The discipline of D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s Army is said to be &quot; good up to a point.&quot; A secret service is organised by D&apos;Annunzi&apos;o in Italy. Lists of all visitors to Fiume are sent to Italy, where careful inquiries are made. The courier generally returns with considerable sumB of money, the origin of which has, so far, not been ascertained. Should they emanate from private supplies or from banks, the fact would not entirely preclude the possibility of guidance by higher authority.An Italian steamer loaded with grain was stopped and seized some time ago by D&apos;Annuuzio&apos;s fleet. The Italian authorities made great protests and claimed the restitution of the cargo. It is, however, averred that the Italians knew beforehand that the ship was going to be captured, and that D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s torpedo boats would only fire blank.D&apos;Annunzio, as previous reports show, is also rendering important assistance, and it seems clear that his action is taken with the knowledge and connivance of the Italian authorities.In February last D^nnunzio sent a secret mission to Paris which appears to have had considerable results. Among the members of the mission were Captain Renenera and Signor Giuratti.* They carried letters to the Irish, Egyptian, and Boer Delegations in Paris asking them to send representatives to Italy in order to form an international anti-English Committee which&apos; would create trouble in every English colony. The moral and material assistance of the Italian Government and people were promised. Incidentally the mission was charged to get into touch with the French Pacifist and Socialist elements in order to enlist their support on behalf of the independence of Fiume, &amp;c. As one result of this mission, Mr. 0&apos;Kelly was sent immediately from Paris to Rome, where he is still living and working. Dr. Abdul Hamid Said was also charged by Zaglul Pasha to proceed to Rome, where he is displaying great activity in a thoroughly congenial atmosphere.Some sort of friction appears since to have arisen between Rome and Fiume over the question of the purchase and the transport of arms and munitions. D&apos;Annunzio directed his two secretaries, Martini and Kochnitsky, to deal with this question. They quarrelled with Advocate Costa, leader of the Fiumist party in Rome, and Lieutenant Catoi over certain financial matters, and Kochnitsky published some objectionable announcements in the press. As a result of this, not only did he fall out with General Tarditti and Abdul Said, but both he and Martini were suspected and subsequently found to be spies of Signor Nitti. Indeed, they were also suspected of being British spies. The Fiumist party in Rome asked D&apos;.A nnunzio forthwith to dismiss the two secretaries, together with some other, members of his staff. Failing this, D&apos;Annunzio was informed that no society could be formed under his presidency, and that no foreign leaders would be allowed to negotiate with him. Up to the 29th May no reply had been received from D&apos;Annunzio.It is said that the Advocate Costa, who has helped D&apos;Annunzio financially, will secure a loan of two milliards for the Fiume Government, and may be appointed Governor of Fiume in D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s place.* The spelling of these names is uncertain.
4. THE EVANGELICAL PURITANISM OF LENIN.&apos; [The following Article consists of Extracts from a more extended Report by a British Writer who has recently returned from Soviet Russia.)Russians have for the most part as little idea of a patria as the average Gaul had in the &quot;time of Caesar, and I have heard of many-Russians who did not know that they themselves were Russian, their imaginations having never travelled beyond the confines of their native province.Knowing the existence of this state of things, I was not surprised, subsequently, when we were captured at Krasnoyarsk, to find that the soldiers of the Red Army were indifferent as to our nationality, and were only anxious to know which of their two categories we belonged to. We were never once asked for our passports, such tokens of nationality being regarded as antique lumber which all mankind was throwing on the scrap-heap as fast as it could along with crowns and croziers. There was pained surprise when the private soldiers in our party did not, on being released by capture from their military &quot; servitude,&quot; join their natural friends the Bolshevists joyfully and at once, but remained volun-voluntarily with their natural enemies, us, their officers.Lenin knows more about conditions in the outer world than the simple folk who captured us at Krasnoyarsk, but he knows much less than he is given credit for in this country. He is a fanatical believer in his own dogma of Internationalism and in the duty incumbent on him of preaching it to all peoples. In speaking of this remarkable man many Englishmen seem to create in their own minds the picture of a statesman who will act, as they themselves would do, if they were in his position. They think that the responsibilities of office must sober and modify him, as it would sober and modify an English Socialist. They believe that his Extremist utterances are mere popular clap-trap, such as an English politician sometimes indulges in for electioneering purposes, that he must &quot; play up &quot; to the impossible demands of his party, but that, when it comes to practical politics, he is bound to display moderation and common sense.Such Englishmen do not know Lenin&apos;s character. They read their own character into that of Lenin, and attribute to him an English mentality and training which he has not got. Lenin is, in the first place, a Russian; that is, he has in him a strain of the idealist, the ascetic, the prophet, the fanatic, who would be rather pleased than otherwise to be a martyr for what he regarded as a great principle. There is in him and in the whole Communist party a good deal of that inflexibility, uarrow-ness, intolerance, and fanaticism which we associate with the Eastern Church ; and I might add, by the way, that if Bolshevism continues in power for a few years longer it will inevitably become a dead and mummified system like Orthodoxy.Lenin has all the characteristics of a fanatical Byzantine monk. He has narrowness, intolerance, asceticism, a fixed idea, and an incapacity to change. He believes in Karl Marx just as firmly as a Byzantine monk might believe in St. Nicholas, the Wonder-worker, and the same remark applies to all.his followers.Bolshevism, though anti-religious, has behind it all the driving force of a new religion, a religion quite as aggressive, as was Islam at its most militant period. Like Islam, also, it must spread or it will dwindle down. Like a forest fire, it must always have fresh material to feed upon. At Krasnoyarsk, where I witnessed the first onrush of the Red Terror, I
found it at its brightest. In Ekaterinburg the fire was already low. When I came to Moscow I found myself in the dead heart of a burnt-out conflagration.Though he has travelled abroad Lenin has lived, even abroad, in a close revolutionary atmosphere, which is after all a very narrowing atmosphere.* He brooded over his own ideas, exchanged views with people who were much of the same way of thinking as himself, and entered into controversy only with Mensheviks, Anarchists, and other visionaries, who are even further removed from the realities of life than he is. His ignorance of conditions in England is, therefore, very great. His manner of life has deprived his mind of all flexibility, and imparted to his utterances a pontifical tone, which would not be tolerated for a moment in political circles auy where outside Russia.The Russian newspapers are filled daily with interminable disser-tations on abstruse Socialistic subjects from his pen or from the pen of other prophets of Bolshevism, and the style of these lucubrations bears some resemblance, in respect at least of extreme aridity, to the intermin-able treatises on obscure theological questions which were popular in Europe during the religious ferment of the 16th and 17th centuries. Instead of quotations from the Early Fathers, they are full of ponderous quotations from German professors, who are apparently regarded by the Communists as infallible authorities. And, in the same way as some English congregations of the post-reformation period delighted in sermons lasting three or four*hours, so the Bolshevists delight in endless speeches on abstruse Socialistic subjects. .But amid all this confusion and obscurity there remains clear the ,fixed idea of Internationalism whereof Lenin is the prophet. He has passed most of his life in poverty and exile on account of it. He. is now wading towards it through blood. It would be a mistake, there-fore, to think that. he will ever really surrender it, though he may promise to do so for the sake of getting locomotives and machinery from&apos; us. He has made this perfectly clear in hundreds of speeches and newspaper, articles.; if we think otherwise he has ,a perfect right to say that he has not deceived us, that we have deceived ourselves. In a way he is honest, for he has warned us not only in his public utterances but by his actions that he will not keep any.promises he makes to capitalistic States, and that he will use any methods and aceept help from any quarter in order to attain his ends. He accepted help from the Kaiser in 1918 in order to contribute afterwards towards the Kaiser&apos;s overthrow.i and he has frequently boasted, that when he made peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk and promised to.cease his revolutionary propaganda in Germany,.he never meant to observe the conditions of!that peace and did not observe them in so. far as they related to propaganda.The danger of this propaganda consists.in the idea of internationalism. This theory enables the Bolsheviks to find accomplices and allies in the most unexpected places outside Russia-in battleships, wireless stations, military barracks, post offices, consulates, palatial hotels, and mansions. The result is that no one holding a responsible position in a non-Bolshevik , country can be sure that he has not in his employ an embittered subordinate sometimes with a genuine grievance against society and a genuine belief in communism as a cure for all the ills of the world, but&apos; * &quot;His eyes,&quot; said Krassin lately in conversation, &quot;are not cast upwards but on *: the ground. Lenin is a fanatic, if you like to call him so. I remember seeing him if, in Switzerland in a hare room with a single chair and table, and for ornaments &quot; portraits, of Karl Marx and other Socialist leaders pasted -on .the wall, without &quot; frames. He lives in the same simplicity now.&quot;
more frequently aggrieved because of a natural incapacity which, education does, not and cannot remedy.This danger is manifest on the Continent, and especially in the countries which lie near Russia. There is a persistent leakage of official information in the Finnish, Scandinavian, and Polish posts, telegraphs, and hotels, and even in some of the foreign consulates and legations. One such case of leakage that I know of was suspected to have taken place in a foreign consulate in Warsaw. The position in Finland is especially bad from this point of view owing to the accentuation of class differences by the arming of the middle classes and the disarming of the working classes, a measure which has been of enormous assistance to the inter-nationalist propaganda in that country.I have tried to make it clear how impossible it is for the Communists to abandon their theory and practice of International propaganda. My contention may be strengthened by a description, from personal observa-tion, of the conditions which prevail in the People&apos;s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs at Moscow; Most of the members of that department belong to the Third International, and their main work as such is to produce revolutions in foreign countries. After working hard all day organising trouble for us in India, Persia, Turkey, and Egypt, they allow themselves some comic relief and relaxation in the afternoon by the composition of soothing despatches intended for the English bourgeoisie. One of them, Commissary Feinberg, acts very often as a correspondent of an English newspaper, the Daily Herald. Many of the English pass-ports which go through Feinberg&apos;s hands, get &quot; lost,&quot; that is, they are set aside for the use of Bolshevik emissaries going to England, or else utilised as models in the well-equipped establishment for the forgery of English passports which the Third International has inaugurated. English banknotes are also fabricated there, and may be expected on the market at any moment. Thus we have the Foreign Office of a great country deliberately forging the passports and the paper money of a Foreign Government with which it is conducting friendly negotiations, and Foreign Office officials calmly supervising the work of forgery.In April last there sat in the F.O. at Moscow and under the aegis of Chicherin, a pan-Mohammedan Congress whose object was to stir up trouble in India, Persia, and Turkey. This congress was not composed of chance delegates, but of chosen and dangerous men in touch with anti-British organisations all over the Near and the Middle East. I saw and spoke with the Afghan and Indian delegates, and I believe that there were also Persian and Turkish delegates present. One of the Indians was the notorious Professor Barkatula. The meetings of this congress continued for a long time. Members of the F.O. staff took part in them, I believe. Strict secrecy was observed, and the doors were guarded by officials of the Soviet Government. I once discovered in the F.O. a written application from the Mohammedan delegates to the Foreign Minister. It asked that permission should be given to a certain Moslem agent to come from, I think, Askhabad to Moscow, and proved, though proof was unnecessary, that the F.O. was mauaging the whole business.Can we make the Bolshevist Government stop all this ? I do not think that we can ; for the F.O., like the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and one or two other organisations of technical experts, is regarded by the Executive Committee generally as being very lukewarm in the Faith and as having made too many concessions already to the capitalistic heretics outside. The organisation of the Third International is so interwoven with the. whole Bolshevist
Government organisation that it would he difficult to say where the one ends and the other begins, and quite impossible to separate them. Most of the leading commissaries are in the International as well as in the Communist group which rules Russia, and they can never be depended upon to expel, themselves from the latter body. Foreign revolutionaries orate frequently from the same platform as Lenin and Trotsky ; and they are not regarded as foreigners because, in the Communist scheme of things, there are no foreigners, only Proletariat and Parasites.Printed by Etrb and SPomswoonE, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.0.4.
