if-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,(11554) Foreign Office.East Indies/001.MEMORANDUMONUNREST IN THE DUTCH EAST INDIES.SPEAKING in 1919, the Dutch Minister for the Colonies stated: &quot;It is obvious that the world war has made in the Ease Indies impressions the depth of which cannot perhaps yet be fully sounded&quot; ; and his words were merely an echo of the alarm prevalent in Holland and in Dutch Colonial circles as to the future of Java and its dependent islands. Even ten years ago Java was a negligible factor in the world&apos;s politics. But that is all changed. It is now an important and disturbing element in the tide of Asiatic unrest&apos;, which is of vital importance to the British Empire, and will be one of the most serious problems of the immediate future.We find in Java the following disquieting elements : 1. An immense native population, living close to the starvation line and seething with discontent.2. A strong Arab influence, a section of which is pro-Turkish and anti British.The Arabs of the Dutch East Indies support the Arabs of the Hadramaut(South Arabia), and are of some importance in the Mahommedan world.The native population of Java is almost entirely Mahommedan, and theArabs have considerable influence. ,3. A restless intelligentzia among the natives and half-castes, whose avowed policyis independence for the Indies. 4. A nervous Government which cannot trust its own army and navy, and whosepolicy of conciliation towards the natives is viewed with alarm by theDutch colonists. 5. A large and rich Chinese colony.6. The advent of the Japanese, who have acquired considerable interests in the islands, who are suspected of intriguing with native discontent, and are believed to be coveting the islands for themselves. - 7. A strong German influence.The total population of the islands is estimated at about 50,000,000; but as 36,000,000 of these are accredited to Java, the political significance of the whole: archipelago, as far as &quot; unrest&quot; and &quot; bolshevism &quot; are concerned, is limited to this one island. Java is pitifully overcrowded, having an average of 700 persons to the square1 mile, and village merges into village along the high roads of the island. This, of. course, is the ultimate reason for the unrest. Javanese coolies are shipped in some numbers for contract labour in Sumatra, Borneo and British Malaya, but they eventually come home again, so the congestion remains unrelieved.Out of 36,000,000 persons in Java 86,000 (1912 figures) were stated to be Europeans. 92 per cent, of these were Dutch, but only 7 per cent, born in Holland. That is to say, the half-caste element is very considerably preponderant, and this preponderance appears in the Army, Civil Service, Industry and Commerce.Java is almost entirely an agricultural country.. Rice, which is the food of the natives, is the most essential &quot;crop ; but the island is not self-supporting. It imports rice from Saigon, Bangkok and Rangoon, mostly via Singapore. It is stated that the price of rice has risen 400 per cent since 1914. The most profitable crop is sugar. Oei Tjian Ham, the Samarang sugar king, is reckoned to be worth 8,000,0001.; the personal profits of a managing director of a certain British firm at Sourabaya was estimated at 80,000Z. for the year 1918. It is clear that &quot; profiteering&quot; has been rife in Java.&apos; An energetic native press, a list.of twelve Javanese papers has come to hand for Central Java alone, has been informing the native of the immense wealth, which his labour, paid in 1918 at the rate of about 9d. per day, has been amassing for the white man and the Chinese.   This is a second reason for unrest. .The Javanese are practically all Mohammedans. Although they are not over strict in religious observance, the pilgrimage to Mecca is the crown of their ambition. This journey keeps them in touch with the currents of opinion in the Near East.   The177   [3616]
Javanese, therefore, are a fringe of the pan-Islamic army and of the anti-white moye-ment which has gained such impetus owing to the war. Moreover, the Javanese have a strong national sentiment. They remember with pride their old empire of Madjapahit, which ruled the whole island before the Moslems or the white men came, and their civilisation, of which a fine artistic tradition still remains. They still have their Emperor, the Susuhunan, with his court at Solo; but the Dutch, who rule in Java on the principle of divide et impera, have raised up a kindred and rival court at Djokja. The pure Javanese themselves are divided by a serious-language,barrier from the Sundanese in East Java. .So there are two sources of unrest in Java; one economic and veering, towards Bolshevism, and one political and nationalist.It is generally stated by Dutch and natives alike that the modern history of unrest in Java dates from the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The Japanese victory shattered for ever the spell of the invincibility of the white man under which the native races of Asia have been held. The first organised party aiming at independence for the Dutch Indies, the &quot;Indische Partei &quot; (now known as &quot; Insulinde,,), came into existence in 1912&apos; under the leadership of Douwes Dekker. This restless and unscrupulous individual, being banished from the islands, was at one time during the war in relations with the German Secret Service, and afterwards gave evidence on the British side in the San Francisco trial of the Indian seditionists. He was allowed to return to the Dutch Indies, but was arrested this ,year and is now under examina-tion. He has acknowledged within the last year that he is in the pay of the British Indian Nationalist Party. He is the editor of a paper called &quot; De Beweging.&quot; He enjoys considerable influence. ; This &quot; Insulinde&quot; Party, though in alliance with the pure Indian natives, represents primarily the aspirations of the half-castes. Other ieaders of the party are Teeuwen, Tjipto and Abdoel Rifai.&quot; Sarikat Islam,&quot; the great native and Mohammedan society, came into existence about the same time. At first apparently a friendly society, it soon acquired a political complexion. It frankly advocates Java for the Javanese. At first it existed as separate local organisations, the Colonial Government refusing to recognise a central body. But in 1916 Governor-General Idenburg, as&apos;a parting present, granted his sanction. The central body has never had complete control over its component parts, and it is much more moderate and on much better terms with the Colonial Government than, for instance, the Samarang branch in Central Java, which is extremely revolutionary. The president of Central Sarikat Islam, Tjokro Aminoto, is a Government nominee to the &quot; Volksraad.&quot; Other leaders are Mas Marco, Abdoel Moeis and Semaoen (extreme). The society boasts a membership of 2,500,000. It has affiliations throughout the islands, and even in British Malaya, but is an active force only in Java and in the East Coast province of Sumatra.The &quot; Indische Sociaal Democratische Vereeniging&quot; is an extreme Communist organisation formed among the natives through the activities of certain Dutch propagandists, notably Sneevliet, Baars, Brandsteder and Bergsma. This organisation was particularly active at Samarang in Central Java in 1918, where it made an alliance with the local Sarikat Islam in a fight against &quot; capitalism.&quot; This agitation came to a head in November 1918 with theKoedoes riots and the lightermen&apos;s strike at Samarang. Both these events played into the hands of the Government. The strike collapsed, and Sneevliet was banished from the islands and returned to Holland, where he is now a considerable personage in the Bolshevik world. The events of 1918 were a serious blow to native agitation, which seemed to be hopeless without European leadership.In 1919 there was less outward disturbance in Java, but there were small outbreaks at Solo and at Garoet (Preanger Regencies), in both of which Douwes Dekker appears to have been implicated. These led to the discovery of a so-called &quot; B department &quot; of Sarikat Islam, a secret union of the society which advocates &quot; opposition to the legal authority.&quot;,   Since the beginning of 1920 the European element in Java has become increasingly nervous.   &quot; Unrest&quot; is now taking on an economic rather than a political aspect. A recent letter from a Dutchman in Java states : &quot; The organisation which at present causes the most anxiety is the &quot; Vakcentrale &quot; (Trade Union). The labourers of 161 sugar factories have already joined, and fully 42,000 labourers have become members of the Factory Union (or League of the Personnel of the Factories), a sub-section of the Trade Union. A great danger lies in this organisation for the sugar industry, and the great difficulty of acting against this combine lies in the fact that legally very little can
be done to such societies, and the Governments in Europe also are almost powerless against them. Here in Mid-Java an absolute boycott of the European agricultural industries has been proclaimed by Tjokro Aminoto, the President of the Central Sarikat Islam. In West Java a minimum wage of one florin per day (about Is. 10(1) is demanded for unskilled labour.&quot;Another recent report states that the central bureau of the revolutionary Trades Unions of the Dutch Indies has been established in Djokja. Its president is Sosrokardono, and it runs a paper called &quot; Kasem Moeda&quot; (New Thought). It is in touch with the &quot; Communists Wynkoop and Sneevliet in Holland. A similar newspaper called &quot; Soera Bekelei &quot; (War Cry) is being published at Samarang. &quot; The dangerous elements,&quot; says the correspondent quoted above, &quot; are the revolutionaries, for example, Sneevliet, the present exiled leader of the people, who has worthy disciples in Bergsma and Snmaoen and also in Baars, who is shortly expected in Java where he is going to be employed by the Samarang municipality. By drawing attention to the shortcomings of the Government machine, they deceive the people that they are being treated as a subjugated race, that they are being sweated by the capitalists and that the present officials govern the country and the people badly because the Government supports the capitalists. Their purpose, therefore, is to advance the economic condition of the people. By such means they obtain a large following, especially the unscrupulous adventurers who have nothing to lose but everything to gain. Their real purpose, however, is to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. Sneevliet himself was not without means, but was in possession of sugar shares for a large amount. The consequence of the Sneevliet propaganda is the general strike of the workers in the printing offices in Samarang now in progress (March 1920). This strike was supposed to be intended for material advancement, but was really undertaken to make the duped people discontented and to Jead to a revolution as soon as they have been driven by hunger to cause disturbances. By this means, about 1,000 well-paid workers have been thrown out of work.&quot;Similarly, a recent article in &quot; Java Bode &quot; considers that the factors which have wrought such havoc in Sarikat Islam are (1) Communism, -the &quot;cancer of Indian society&quot; ; and (2) the doubtful morality of the leaders. &quot; Carried away by the fanaticism of European Communists, certain leaders of Sarikat Islam have allowed their organisation to be dragged down the road of revolution. In this way Sarikat Islam, which as a popular movement was at first so worthy of sympathy, to-day borders on a state of complete degeneration and confusion.&quot;Faced by . the problem of native unrest, the Dutch Colonial Administration has outlined its policy as follows : &quot; The resources of the Indies are, as far as possible, to be developed by the Indian population. This population is to be educated so that they may be able to look after their own interests and the governing of their own country, and thus lay the foundation for complete self-government.&quot;The Governor-General is the autocrat of the Indies, but he must be guided by the advice of his Council The colonial budget must be discussed and voted by the States General in Holland. Moreover, in pursuance of the policy of admitting the people, both European and native, to some part in the direction of public affairs, the &quot; Volksraad &quot; was established in 1918. This council is purely consultative, but the Governor-General is obliged to lay before it general, financial and military matters. There are thirty-nine members.As a general statement, it may be said that the Colonial Government has no&apos; friends. The Dutch planters and merchants, having inherited the tradition of the old East India Company, whose general view was that &quot; the Javanese was made to labour,&quot; consider the Government vacillating and weak. The most frequent criticism is that it is too &quot; ethisch,&quot; i.e., that its policy is idealistic and humane, and does not take actual conditions sufficiently into account. In West Java a planters&apos; meeting has recently passed a resolution drawing attention to the shortcomings of the Government. The Eurasians, who find that the Chinese are ousting them from business and the natives from the Civil Service, have founded a new society, the &quot; Politieke Economische Bond,&quot; which though primarily intended as a counter-blast to Sarikat Islam and the Communist movement, appears to aim at overthrowing the present Governor-General (Count van Limburg Stirum), and obtaining a military Governor-General with a strong policy. The natives are also against the Government; for, as Kipling says, &quot; It is a hard law but an old one, Borne died learning it as our western civilisation may die, 
that if you give any man anything that he has not painfully earned for himself, you infallibly make him and his descendants your devoted enemies.&quot;The Dutch Colonial Government, however, considers, in the words of a recent article in &quot; Java Bode,&quot; that &quot; it is above all by raising the social and economic level of the population, in working for its wellbeing, that they will deprive the agitators of their principal weapon.&quot; Count van Limburg Stirum has decided, to encourage the native movement, which has all his sympathy, Accordingly, reforms in the educational system of the natives are being introduced on a large scale which a view to educating the next generation to a capacity for self-government. Considerable powers are tto be transferred from the Dutch Resident to the native Regent in the administrative residences of Java, and an experiment has already been made in the Tjandjoer Regency. &quot;The European administration will confine itself more and more to the giving of guidance and advice wherever necessary, gradually leaving the direct administration to native officials&apos;; (Colonial Report for 1919). It is clear from the debates in the Volksraad that it is expected that within twenty-five years the Indies will have made progress towards self-government; and that Holland is approved as being likely to recognise the equality of the natives sooner than would the Anglo-Saxon nations;The chances of a revolution in the near future are freely debated among all classes in Java. In a recent article Mr. J. Koning, editor of the leading Sourabaya daily, says: &quot; The native movement is a pernicious expression of Pan-Islamism; sanguinary conflicts are bound to come within the next few years; the chances of an early revolution in the Indies are large; even an immediate change in the policy of the Government and a change in the supreme authority.cannot considerably reduce these chances.&quot; Mr. Koning believes that the coming revolution will not put an end to Dutch rule, but will cost Dutch lives. This is the general opinion of European residents in the Dutch Indies. Perhaps their anxiety is excessive. They believe, however, in their ultimate ability to cope with the revolution; but if so, they depend more upon their native troops from Ambon (Molucca Islands) and Minahassa (North Celebes) than upon the white and Eurasian army, which is honeycombed with communism and discontent. It is no wonder therefore that the Dutch Government has extended such a warm welcome to German recruits from among the war prisoners in Japan, eighty-seven of which are to be enrolled among the police. The formation of rifle clubs among the European residents is being encouraged ; and the Government has been unostentatiously shipping a quantity of arms and ammunition to Java.Recent information shows no sign that conditions are getting better, rather the contrary. The &quot; Rotterdamsche Courant&quot; of the 24th March reports that strikes are breaking out in all the sugar-growing districts which come under the influence of the Bolshevik Revolutionary Central Trade Union. This union is endeavouring to extend its political sphere. Employers flatly refuse to discuss with the political strike leaders, who generally stand quite outside the various industries. The colony is threatened with economic dislocation. The same paper on the 13th April states, &quot; Conditions promise to grow worse than in the times of Sneevliet. The communistic tendency of the Federation of Trades Unions is becoming more and more manifest, and is responsible for labour unrest all over Java. Baars, the communist, and revolutionists like Bergsma and Semaoen, have all received public appointments at Samarang.&quot;It is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard with equanimity the dangerous tendency of affairs in the Dutch islands. Unrest in Java is an essential part of the Asiatic movement. This movement, as &quot; Pan-Islamism &quot; in the Turkish Empire, as &quot;Ghadr&quot; in India, as-&quot; Militarism&quot; in Japan, as the awakening of nationalism in China, as demands for independence in the Philippines and for treaty revision in Siam, is swelling into a formidable bulk of opposition, the brunt of which must be borne by the British Empire. The economic wealth of the Dutch Indies is enormous; they produce in plenty petroleum and coal, sugar, copra, rubber, quinine, coffee, tea, tobacco, spices, &amp;c. A state of anarchy in these islands would be a disaster to the whole world, and a state of affairs wmich neither the British, the Americans nor the Japanese can afford to contemplate. Sir Ross Smith V flight to Australia has removed any doubt as to the geographical importance of the islands in the communications of the future. The British Government can have no wish to undertake Hollands alarming responsibilities. All our efforts should be directed towards maintaining the status quo. Regarding the Asiatic problem, our interests are entirely at one with the Dutch, and it would, seem that any rapprochement, social or political, would prove of advantage to both nations.  .June 18, 1920. ;o
