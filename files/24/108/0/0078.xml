HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC i,IAJESTY S GCVFt&apos;RNi\EKfJ:.)C.P. 1575,SECRET.COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS,CABINET,EMERGENCY POWERS BILL(Memorandum &quot;by the Chairman of the Supply &amp; Transport Commit tee)At a Cohference of Ministers held oh June 14th 19^0i it was decided that the Emergency Bill, which has been drafted in order to give the Government full powers In a  $rave emergency, should be referred for examination by the Home Affairs Committee, more particularly from a political p6int of view0framed with the object of giving the Government- full powers to meet a situation which would amount practically to revolution^ In view of its secret character I do not wish to give It a wide circulation^ but the Bill can be produced at any meeting of the -Home Affairs Committee.     The Bill has already been considered by the Supply and Transport Committee; who have taken note of itn It is regarded as an extreme measure, of which use should be made only in the last resort.  -What is&apos;required, in my opinion, is a decision as to the action which the Government should take .iri order to maintain in force those emergency powers which will lapse when the war ends or the Emergency Powers Continuance Act terminates(whichever is the later date)0   in particular., it should be decided whether powers should be asked for from Parliament to sanction the use of the Navy, Army and Air Force in non-military duties.     Oh this subject I circulate a memorandum by the Home Secretary (Paper No* T.C.91), and should be grateful for a decision from the Home Affairs Committee on the alternative courses suggestedI assume that the Home Affairs Committee will ask each Department concerned to explain Its point of view.The Bill In question is of a very drastic character and Isby him.

I&apos; CABINET.91. SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT COMMITTEE.E^RGENOY   PO^RS. (Memorandum by the Home Secretary).In accordance with the request made by the Supply and- Transport Committee at the meeting on the 23rd &apos;farchf the Home Office has c6fHptled the annexed list of the powers which the various depart-ments consider^ necessary to enable them to deal with a grave emergency affecting the life of the community after the powers given by the Defence of the Realm Act have expired.     The powers claimed are classified as directed by the Supply and Transport Committee.It will be seen that the most important powers are included in Class A5 which contains those required from the first day of the emergency,.     They include all the powers of. the Ministry of Food and most of those of the Coal. Controller and the Ministry of Trans-port as well as the power to require members of the fighting forces to undertake non-military work and important powers needed by the Ministry of Shipping; the Board of Customs and the Electrical Services CommitteeuClass B (powers required by the fourth day of the emergency) includes further powers asked for by the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Shipping and the demands of the Ministry of. Labour, the Board of Trade (as regards petrol) and the Home Office..No department&apos;is prepared to defer action until revolution-&amp;ry disturbances arise and Class C is therefore blank.It is&apos; possible that some of the departments after further discussion mtgTit agree to the postponement of some of their powers,- but the modifications which could be accepted would not be such as to alter the general clw-kcter of the problem, and it
appears best to cubmlt the matter to the Committee at this stager, The question is what course should be taken to provide,for the possibility that, after Parliament is prorogued, orriseo for a long Autumn&apos;recess, an emergency may arise as great or greater than the Railway Strike of September, 1919, and calling for similar or even stronger action on the part of the State.It ,1s agreed that the first essential is to pass a Rill enabling Parliament to be assembled within three days, but after this has been done, if a strike occurs when Parliament&quot; is not sitting It is unlikely that Parjlament could be assembled and a Bill containing the powers enumeraoea in Glasses A and B sould be possed within seven aays0     In the meantime the position might become so bad as to be beyond remedy *Two courses may be suggested to guard against this danger. (1) To include in the annual Expiring Laws Continuance Act a provision prolonging those Defence of the Realm Regulations whioh are enumerated in the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act.   This should be accompan1eo^^ithp^edge that these powers would not be used save in a sericir eme-rgency,-.     If this were done the position during the recess would not be worse than it is at present, though all the powers asked for would not be available, particularly the power to require members of the fighting forces to assist in non-military duties and the power to requisition accommodation for volunteers.(2) To include in the Bill for the emergency summoning of Parliament a power to make regulations &quot;for the public safety&quot; on lines similar to the Defence&apos; of the Realm Regulations, but with the proviso that these powers will expire within a week of the meeting of Parliament unless confirmed by resolutions of both Houses and will thereafter be subject to be determined at any time by a resolution of either House.     If this were done it would be possible when an emergency arises to embody in an
Order in Council -all -the&apos; poirew ^julred: by tto&amp;ji urvwl departments, both new and old, and many of them could be made much narrower in their application than in the existing Defence of the Realm Regulations.E * B *14. 5.  0;CLASSIFICATION 09 POWERS RWIRET) by VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY;As requested by the Supply and Transport Committee, the Home Office has asked the Departments concerned to specify the powers which they would require to meet an emergency of the gravest kind when the Defence of the Realm Act and the Regulations prolonged by the War Emergency Laws Continu-ance Act have expired, and to classify them under the following conditions:-A. At the outbreak of a strike and up to the end of thefirst four days.B. After the first four days when the struggle has becomeintense and is similar in gravity to the Railway Strike of September, 1019,C. When the struggle involves serious,civil disturbancesamounting to attempts- at revolution.The following cables give the result of the inquiry.In toe tables &quot;the Bill&quot; means the first draft Emergency Powers Bill (not the modified Bill, NOo2)j   and &quot;D.R.R.&quot; means a Defence of the Realm Regulation as existing on the 1st January, 1920.

SECRET,T.0,94. CABINET.SUPPLY AlJJ) TRANSPORT COMMITTEE. MBggggOY POWERS.Admiralty Memorandum for the Supply and TransportCommittoo.With reference to tho ilomo Secretary1 s Memorandum of 14th May (T*C.9l), tho Admiralty desire to make clear to the Supply and Transport Committee what, under the alternative courses suggested, will bo the position in regard to the utilisation of tho navy for carrying on services of essential importance to tho Public if these are interrupted owing to industrial disturbance.(a) If course (1) mentioned in tho Home Secretary^ Memorandum is adopted, viz: the inclusion in the annual Expiring Laws Continuance Act of a provision prolonging thoso Defence of tho Realm Regulations which are enumerated in tho War Emergency Laws(Continuance) Aot:-tho Navy would not be available for carrying on services of essential importance to tho Public until Parliament had assombled and had passed tho Bill containing tho fowors enumerated in Classes A. oc B. (attached to tho Homo Secretary1 s Memorandum), except in so far as any of thoso services can in tho actual circumstances of tbua moment bo properly regarded by tho Admiralty as &quot;affecting some military Object, purposo, or proceoding,&quot;     .,(b) If the alternative course (2) mentioned in the Homo secretary Memorandum is adopted, - viz: tho inclusion in tho Bill for tho emergency summoning of&quot;Parliament a power to make &quot;Regulations for tho public safety.&quot; :-the navy could be made available for carrying &apos;on services of essential importance to tho Public, to whatever extent tho Regulations &quot;for the public safety&quot; authorised this.(c) But both the foregoing alternatives apply only to a state of affairs in which there is a grave emergency necessitating the summoning of Parliament and other extraordinary measures. Uoithor alternative provides for strides of a lessor nature than can be classified as a &quot;grave emergency&quot;, although their effecton tho convenience of the public may bo serious, o^g. such an occurrence as a strike of the Electrical Trades Union affecting tho Sloe trie Powar Stations of-London.In such cases, - unless lobal powers beyond those contemplated in tho Home secretary Memorandum are obtained beforehand, - the assistance of tho Bevy must in accordance with the opinion of tho Law Officers of the Crown be limited to services which can in the circumstances then actually existing be properly regarded by tho Admiralty as &quot;affecting somo   . military object, purposo or proceeding&quot;.(Signed)     W.H.L.1st June, 1920.
