this comikg roaagioYiaHTThe signs of a period of uneraploynont in the near future ere growing.   In the opinion of many competent observers it may be a blessing In disguise, since it met result immediately in the lowering of retail prioes, whioh will probably not again attain the post-war level.   It is fortunate that it should have been postponed to a time when the nerve strain of the War has been to some extent relaxed,   Labour leaders themselves are tired of this constant agitation, and the unskilled labourers are beginning to realise that their places can be filled by unemployed even now.   There is a growing feeling in all ranks that the time has come for some firmness to be shown.THIS COAL UWSRS*As anticipated in my last report, the miners at Leamington have demanded an increased we^e of 2s. a shift for adults, le. a shift for youths and 9d. a shift for boys under 16, coupled with a demand for a reduction in the price of domestic coal of 14s. Sd.   This seoond demand is nut forward with the idea of placating public opinion.At the Railwaymen&apos;s Congress at Belfast a violent attack was made upon the Secretary of State for v/ar with reference to intervention in Russia,   ilx. C. T, Crawp went oo far as to say that Soviet government on the Russian plan might be Introduced without the accompaniment of bloodshed, and that it was worth consideration whether our own and other Governments might, be more effective &quot;If they had some form of Industrial representation.&quot;
"HANDS OF RUSSIA3 MOVEMENT

The agitation against the Polish offensive has died down in the provinces And in London public interest is waning. The last two meetings held in Crosvenor Square on July 3rd and 4th were negligible.  The "Daily Herald" reported that 2,000 people were present at the second meeting, but though the afternoon was fine the attendance did not exceed 500, of whom more than half were apparently unsympathetic spectators.   The sale of extremist literature was very poor.

On July 11th a demonstration will be held at the Albert Hall to welcome the labour delegation. From the notices published, it appears that ? Snowdan will not speak; her exposure of ? and of Lenin has provoked a stream of vituperation from extremists all over the country; they are especially incensed by the fact that she has supplied articles to the "Capitalist Press".

The "Daily Herald" is publishing four articles which Mr. Robert Williams wrote for the "Daily Hall" is that paper declines to print them in their original form. They are pure ? propagada.

The "Hands off Russia" committee is organising a poster parade through the west end on the evening of July 12th and throughout the following day.

The "Daily Herald" of July 7th prints the following illuminating extracts from a "speech reported to have been made at Serpuchovo by Lenin:-

"Freedom" is a bourgeois notion,"devised as a cloak under which,to hide the spectre of economic slavery.   Russia must get rid of the notion that happiness is to be obtained letting every man do as he likes.  An iron Government composed of a few unshrinking men with clear minds and, emphatic class consciousness is what Russia wants Russia wants and what happily Russia has.

"Every Russian has the right to be promotarian and be proletarian and he may be proud of that, but he has not the right

Shirking and grumbling are as wad&quot; forms of treason as intriguing with the White reactionaries, find one treason will be as sharply punished as the other.&quot; .It has now transpired that, the real reason why Hiss Sylvia Pankhurst started a &quot;Communist Party&quot; of her own , was that under the resolution of the Third International at Amsterdam that representation should be on an industrial basis, she would have been excluded.   She is nov trying to get to Huseia; the Norwegians refused her a visa and she declares that she will &apos; stow away&apos;.   On Priday last she received  300 from Russia by the hand of a woman traveller. Her campaign in South l&apos;ales was a failure; she is discredited and in some quarters she is suspected of bein  a traitor to the movement.. ,?he United Communist Party organised by KacIIanue and Inkpin is a more serious effort; its manifesto, is much milder then that of Kiss .Pankhurstt and-fine names of the Committee, in which . ..T.

It is contended that &quot;something&quot;will have to be done to prevent unfair use of the block vote by larse unions to secure the election of their candidates to the rb:ecutive, ... The membership of a few of the greater tuiions nee become so large since recent amalgamations that they can secure the elections of their candidates with little or no regard to their fitness.&quot;&apos;   The &quot;labour Leader&quot; thinks that &quot;its method of voting regains the ohief blot on the  abour Party Conference..   If it is to register free political opinion, it must devise a more accurate va? of showing its opinion. &quot;THE UfllOU OF &apos;2lU xfflglllSllRItJG TRAIUS.......The fusion of the Ifrigineering Unions which became effective on July 1st will undoubtedly result in an aggressiv policy, since itsdominating factor will be the amalgamated society/
Society of Engineers, with a membership of 320,604 and a credit balance of £2,827.094.

SPECIAL TRADES UNION CONGRESS OF IRISH AFFAIRS

It is reported that the special Trades Union Congress which will meet in London on July 13th will consider two resolutions, submitted by the national Union of Railwaymen and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain respectively.  The first calls for "a truce between all parties by the Irish people themselves using their power and influence to stop all murder and outrage, and by the Government withdrawing the Army of Occupation.  In the event of such a truce as suggested being arranged, the Government shall open forthwith an Irish Parliament, with full Dominion powers in all Irish affairs, with adequate protection for the interests of minorities."   The miners&apos; resolution condemns "the ruthless attack upon the liberties and independence of the irish people" and demands the immediate withdrawal of troops.

Although there may be an escape of "hot sir" at the Congress, the probability of extensive support for direct action is remote.

SPEECHES AT THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS

About 200 delegates attended the Annual General Council meeting at Leumington, at which some interesting speeches were made.  Mr. Bon Tillett appealed for labour to take a larger hand in public affairs and a wider outlook; he complained bitterly of profiteering by monopolists and said that in most strikes working men out off their noses to spite their faces. "We must tell our own-Cabinet and France that wars must go on no longer. We must tell the profiteers and junkers of the military casts, and toll Lunin and Trotsky too, that all this bloody war, anarchy, and revolution in the name of the peoples Of all the world must ?. He cannot afford either revolution or/
or war&quot;,Mr. Appleton challenged the statement that every child in Russia was being fed, clothed and educated: as President of the International Federation of Trade Unions, he had sources of information, azid such a statement was a gross absurdity.   He advised them to follow the advice of Mr. Tillett and not look to Russia for an ounce of anyth: for the next three or four years.AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS% correspondent reports that the strike of farm labourers in Cheshire is spreading; the local officials of the Workers1 Union claim that 2,500 men are out, but the farmers state that not more than 1,000 are affected.   There is no doubt that the menTs fear of &quot;blacklegging&quot; is causing them to think before striking.In Ramp ah ire vigorous propaganda for a strike during -the&apos; harvest is being conducted and in Suffolk agitators are said to be working in almost, all the villages for *he same object,!Worcestershire farm workers are very unsettled and contend that their standard of living is far below that of other industries,   Uy Warwickshire correspondent states tha^j great efforts are being made in his district to avoid a stritWFEELING AMONGST EX-SERVICE MENAt a meeting of the Bristol Ex-Service Men on July 3rd it was stated that the march to London will probably begin next week and that the men would take no field kitchens but would &quot;help themselves as they go&quot;.There is considerable feeling in Bristol as a result of the activities of the International Union of Ex-Service lien -and the local Secretary said at a recent meeting &quot;There is no need to negotiate with anyone for arms, all you haveto/
- 7 -3$6to do is to join the Territorials and yon will be supplied with some.&quot;   So far, however, only one ex-private has been found to be in possession of a revolver, whioh was taken from hini by the police.The following interesting  report of the National Union of Jibe- Service Hen has been received from an inside source&quot;About 12 months ago several of the executive members of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers broke away because the Federation would not go over to the Labour Party.   These men formed the first branch of the National Union of  he-Service lien at Ilford.   Tney wanted to make it a National Movement.   Lansbury, Fenner Broikway, Ramsay ilacDonald, Snowclen, etc., provided the finance.   Lansbury alone - so I heard at Head Office from the present financial Secretary three months ago - gave them about  300.   Fenner Brockway sent in a list of names of people who could be approached.   I wrote these appeals out for money myself for the general secretary, who was a Captain in the R.F.A.   I had to mention that Ramsay MaoDonald said we could mention his name, and that he said it would be a tragedy if this particular ex-service movement was hampered in its development through lack of finance.   I , had to enclose with these letters to rich socialists specially selected leaflets.   Those that referred to baok pay for the soldier were not sent, only those that referred to Class-Conscious Ex-Soldiers were sent.   The Union built up i$s organisation by getting the soldiers to believe that by Joining it they would get 6s. a day BACK-PAY. What the men are really wanted for is to help the Socialists overthrow the Government.   The &quot;REAL function of the National Union is to organise ex-service men, and get them Class-Conscious.   They are the basis of the Red Army. Colonel M&amp;lone, M.P., knows that, he told me that they would not be able to do enything until they got stronger. One of the Socialist Labour Party speakers who spoke from the same platform publicly stated that the National Union was the Red Army.   The Independent Labour Party, the Socialist Labour Party and others have been recommended to give the National Union of Soldiers their wholehearted support.Some time ago Sylvia Pankhuret drew up her own form of appeal for money for the National Union of Bx-Service Men and sent it to Head Office for-approval. In her covering letter she said she had some friends who would be pleased to give money.   She sent that letter to the National Union of Ex-Service Men1e Read Office in London three weeks prior to the date on which the aeroplane had to make a forced landing in Latvia&apos;.   The National Union have a membership of about 98,000,not 320,000 as the TDaily Herald&apos; keeps announcing.   The Left Wing - those that have given a pledge to do anything that the National itocutive require - numbered three months ago about 36.000*   The other branches are being carefully nursed,   Sylvia Pankhurst recently sent a circular letter to tho brarohes asking them to read the 1 Workers1 Dreadnought&apos;.   Socialist Labour Party speakers come to the branch meetings and lecture on Communism.The/
The Independent Labour Party send literature down   1 free of cost.   Everything, is being done by the socialists to win them.ail over to rebellion, in trade union branches, socialist societies and pensiX committees.&quot;In the Bradford districts extremists are said to be I organising resistanoo to any calling up orders.: ITR3 ANTI-MILITARISM AKD CIVIL LIB3RTIES L3AGU3 IAs a result of the Liverpool &quot;Hands off Huesia and I Ireland&quot; demonstration on June 23rd, to whioh I referred in my last report, the Rev. Vint Lrughland, Pastor of Pembroke Chapel, held a meeting in his vestry on June 30tl at which the &quot;Anti-Hilitarism and Civil Liberties League&quot; was fonned.   it was decided that the objects of the Leagw would be:-(1)   &quot;to oppose by any and every means the military enterprises of this present Government.&quot;(2)   &quot;to refuse to take uo&apos; arms.&quot;(3)   &quot;to refuse to make or handle munitions.&quot;(4)   &quot;to refuse to pay income tax.&quot; At present the League is of no importr.noe, as only thirteen people were present at the meeting, but Vint Laughlahd and Roberts, who were appointed Chairman and Secretary respectively, are avowed revolutionaries.   The former said that in the event of a revolution it would be the duty of the members to arm and use all their powers. Roberts stated that he visited a Liverpool recruiting office almost every day and did his beet to nersuade young fellows not to join the Army.   Re added, however, that he had not met witty muoh success.THB -UaiOB JACZ AiID W RKP FLAG&quot;    The Labour majority on the Islington Council raised the question of hoisting the Union Jack over the Town Hall r - and/
and voted that the hoisting of the Union Jack should he left to the discretion of &quot;the way or, as &quot;if Lenin came over here it might be expedient to hoist the Red Hag as well as the Union Jack&quot;,   The two members of the Municipal reform Party protested in vain.On tho other hand, a letter appears in &quot;The Post&quot; (organ of the Postal Workers) from a working man who says, &quot;Let the supporters of the&apos; Ked Flag carry their own standard; they do not represent the views of the bulk of the membership.&quot;On June  8th Peginald Bishop, a member ofthe Industrial Workers of the &apos;.&apos;orld and a&apos;book thief by profession, was fined 40s. at iiarlborough Street,Police Court for insulting words and behaviour at a Hyde Park, meeting on the previous day.   In the course of the obstruction which.followed his arrest, Esther Archer, a Whitechapel cigarette maker, was also arrested and . was fined  7 at &quot;Maryborough Street Police Court on July 5th. A sum of about  7 has been collected for her defence at three protest meetings.   It is stated that these people and their associates court imprisonment as they wish to pose as martyrs.Mr, L^STOJGB foSOflS. IIVP.    : &apos; ;At.a.private meeting of the British Socialist Party Maione announced that in future he would represent the party in the House of Commons; he will not accept the Liberal or Coalition Whips,, nor will.he at present join the Parliamentary Labour Party, but if approached he will acoerjt their Whips.   He intend to establish a branch of the Communist Party in Ley ton and he &apos; : will do his best to get the; Ley ton, Labour Party to adopt him as their candidate in place of Carter, their present candidate. He said that his opinions Were still rather fluid, but he was a supporter of the Communist Party and is tending towardsanti/
anti-Parliamentarism.   Mai one BEid that he defended on hie Parliamentary salary for his livelihood, which scarcely tallies with his assertion that the officials and agent of the Liberal Association at East Leyton were paid by him.WILL I All GEEWilliam Gee, of Coventry, who is one of the extremistsexpelled from the Socialist Labour Party for insubordination,has recently been talcing wild sneeches at Salford.   On June30th, in the course of an open air meeting, he uxged all togather round the blood red flag of revolution. &quot;Revolution isat hand&quot;.   The following day he said:&quot;No matter what form the State may assume its annihilation is a necessary prelude to the unbridled and unlicensed freedom of the working class.   I shall be glad when we are called to exercise the same in this country, I am not only in favour of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but I claim that when we see and compare the j ravages which one year1b maintenance of the present system is responsible for with the conditions in the most trying circumstances the Soviet rule would be responsible for in this country, I&apos; am prepared to advise any means in order to bring it about, whatever that may mean.   The revolution in Russia must be sustained as far as possible by us.   The more freedom there is4n Russia and the more sustained the freedom is, the easier our own freedom will be to r,ot,&quot;SINK FSIN IN GR3AT BRITAINThe Glasgow extremists are making the most of &quot;Rands off Ireland&quot; and, as might have been expected, John IiacLean is very much in the limelight.   His &quot;Tramp Trust Unlimited&quot; is printing 100,000 leaflets entitled &quot;Proposed Irish Massacre.&quot; which oonclude:&quot;britain s weak spot ir. on the V/est Coast of Ireland; that is why Lloyd George Fill go through five years&apos; civil war and lose a million (other) men&apos;s lives to prevent Irish Independence...If a civil war starts, America will enter to save &quot;Little Ireland&apos; : a  orId War will ensue v bloodier end more destructive than any before in history.SCOTTISH WORKERS. START A GjSNSRAL STR113 TO PREVENT A CIVIL WAR AND A WORLD &quot;AR.&quot;On June 30th the Orangemen broke up his meeting at Mothenrwelland/
and. ho had to be rescued by Sinn Feiners.- Members are being enrolled in the Sinn Fein Clubs in large numbers and the same care is not now exercised in regard to birth and character.   In consequence the hooligan element is strongly represented in these Clubs, a fact which has a deteriorating effect on the campaign of the &quot;Irish Republic&quot; as far as order is concerned.On June 29th an open-air meeting of the Irish Labour Party was broken up by discharged soldiers.   A disabled ex-soldier on, crutches assaulted several oerqons,, using his crutches as weapons.   Ilo arrests wore made, out tiie sympathy of the crowd was with the soldiers.,;: It is reported that about 40 officers of the Irish Republican Army in Scotland met in the Parochial Ball, Uddingston, Lanarkshire, on 37th June.   The chair was occupied by William ;Mc)illh ill eny end-Robert llaquire acted as Secretary. Representatives were present from Uddingston, Bellshill and Mossend, llotherwell, &quot;Jlentyre, . Iltaallton and Coatbridgo.Reports were submitted by. the delegates on the strength of the Irish Republican Army in Scotland and its efficiency. It was stated that 500 Den had indicated their willingness to go to Ireland when the necessity arose,-and that other contingents. would quickly follow the first.   The conference decided to issue instructions.;to the effect that it,would be inadvisable to carry arms^and munitions as everything necessary in this respect will be provided on arrival if needed.Collections for the Irish railwaymen are being made at all Glasgow Sinn Fein Clubs.. - ,From reports of Sinn Fein demonstrations.held during the week at Socles, Bolton, Bradford, Kewcastle-under-lyne and Cardiff it would appear that Sinn Feiners such as Ilrs. Sheehy-Skeffington end Sean HUroy are. touring V)Q provinces.   &quot;Jhe speeches at Bolton were particularly violent and the following: resolution/
resolution was passed h7 an audience numbering about 250:&quot;That this meeting strongly condemns the attitude oi the British Government in seeking to compel the railwaymen of Ireland to become co-workers with them in the destruction of the Irish nation; demands the immediate stoppage of the landing of munitions in Ireland, which in all probability will be used in taking the.lives of innocent and harmless people.&quot;A small incident that occurred at Southampton last week may have far-reaching results.   A stoker from the American liner &quot;New York&quot;, nt-med ^illlem Barrie, was stopped at the dodk gates and found to be carrying automatic pistols and ammunition, as well as letters from a member of the Clan-na-G-ael addressed to Sinn Peiners in Ireland, denouncing de Valera and hie narty, Barrie will appear on remand at Bow Street next Tuesday and it is intended to ttfce this opportunity for circulating these letters as widely as possible in the press, in order that the quarrel that is developing between the two sections of Sinn r-eifl in the United States maybe carried into Ireland.Meanwhile, Sinn Fein lawlessness continues, especially in the holding of &quot;Republican Courts&quot;; kidnapping iB increasing and the decrees of the &quot;Republican Courts&quot; are enforced through the terror inspired by the Irish Volunteers.   Sinn ?ein is gaining many adherents who Join it unwillingly under fve impression that it is the one forae which is to be reckoned with.175 offences of an indictable nature were reported during the week, but this figure cannot be taken as exhaustive,   Of these offences 128 were directly attributable to 3inn l?ein, 19 were of an agrsrian nature and 28 were serious crimes affecting the state of the oountry,Nortb-East Ulster remains normal, but the greater part of the rest of the country is now in such a state that no loyalist or person of property is safe.&quot;Old Ireland&quot;, the &quot;Watchword of labour&quot; and &quot;Young Ireland&quot;are/
-1? - -   379are published this week; the letter has Just resumed publication and is as bad as the others.   &quot;Old Ireland&quot; has an objectionable article entitled &quot;Derry and Other Places&quot; in which it is alleged that the police joined the Unionists in the masked and armed murder of non-Unionists.labour seems completely dominated by the extreme section of Sinn Pein,   The Irish Transport and General V/orkers Union shows a slight decrease in membership during the past two months.   The reilway situation shows no improvement.   Additional employees are dally suspended owing to their refusal to drive trains carrying the armed forces of the Crown.   Railway traffic is at a standstill in many places.   The labour leaders fear they have mismanaged the situation and are attempting to justify their attitude by putting the blame on the Government, and are relying for financial support on Sinn Fein.Illegal drilling is reported to have been   carried on all over the country from Belfast to Cork.
