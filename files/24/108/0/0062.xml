Ml hiNote on -present conditions InJFlnaaoe and Industrys1.     Since January 1st, if allowance &quot;be;, mads for the  40,000,000 in gold transferred from the banks to the Bank of England, the amount of legal tender&quot; currency in circulation has been reduced by approximately  22,000,000.     There has been some addition &apos;to the amount of copper coinago in circulation, but on balance thoro has been a small reduction in the amount of silver coins.     It is significant that hitherto it has been found possible to avoid any issue of the new 500 fine silver coins except threepenny bits, a sure sign that there has been no fresh inflation of credits Z*     Since January 1st the gross national debt has been reduced by  200,000,000 and the Floating Debt by  60,000,000, 3i     It may be assorted without hesitation that sinoe*January 1st all.new demands for capital, public and private, have been met out of the current savings of the nation, and that not only has the process of manufacturing new credit which was a continuous feature of the calendar year 1919 been chocked but there has also been a small but real deflation of credit.4.     Though this is less easy of exact verification, it is probable that since January 1st the exports of the United I-ingdom visible and invisible have moro than coverod the imports, and that the  50,000,000 which Has   . been either devoted to paying off. foreign debt in that, period or accumulated, for that purpose in foreign currencies has been provided out of.the surplus of exports over imports..    I venture to think further that on balance we have not since January last added, as a nation, to the debts owed to us, publicly and. -&apos;. 1&apos; privately        &apos;; &apos;
privately, toy tho Impecunious countries of the  *&apos; Continent of Europe. .   He have I think made these&apos; countries; pay off a portion of what they owed privately, which they have done by selling us their holdings of foreign securities and to some extent by indirect assistance from the %1 ted States of America and from neutrals.     (There has been a fairly extensive &apos; American speculation in marks and francs.) 5.     In addition to the above favourable symptoms, / attention may be directed to the fact that the &quot;economist index number of wholesale prices has, after 13 months of continuous rise from February 1919 to March 1920 shown a fall in April and May, and will certainly chow a further fall for June*    This fall is all the $ore significant in that it has occured in spite of very considerable rise3 in the prices of coal, flour and sugar which are due simply to the action of the Government in abolishing or reducing subsidies.    Had the index number&quot; throughout boon built on absolute prices ignoring the&quot; effect of subsidies the fall would havo been much more striking* .6,    Retail prices, and especially the cost of living index number, have not yet responded to tho fall in wholesale prices, but this is explainable (1) by the fact that an interval necessarily occurs while retailers are working off stocks paid for at higher prices and (2) by the abolition or reduction of subsidies&apos; and by the well recognised fact that during the period of rising prices public opinion in regard to profiteering prevented retailers from putting prices as high as mere&apos; considerations of demand and &quot;supply warranted, so;that they are tending to maintain retail prices at the same level as before in spite   of falls in wholesale- prices.
7*   Tho-TaluG of sterling in terns of dollars which fell below $-for the first tine at the end of November, 1919* and reached its minimum of $3*l8-early in February, 1920, has now recovered to practically $4. Meanwhile the franc which was quote;] at just under 10 francs to the dollar at the ond of November, 1919* after various ups and downs, is now over 12 francs&apos;to the dollar, sterling having shaken itself free in February, 1920, of its tendency to fluctuate on parallel lines with the franc.1.     Tho favourable symptoms above enumerated can be claimed without hesitation to be due to the combined effects of (a) the payment off of debt out of revenue, (b) stiff rates for money which have (c) forced the Banks to put a check on ored.it expansion and (d) scoured for the Exchequer out of tho current savings of the country a sufficient amount of new money by nay of tax-payments and subscriptions to Government issues to*preclude tho necessity for credit manufacture by tho Government.     These effects h^ve been very greatly enhanced by the shadow of hdavy taxation to come pro-aused by the Budget proposals.2.      In these circumstances the intense hostility to the Government*s financial procedure is only natural. The attacks on the Government proceed from many mutually discordant directions,(a) Those who are sincerely disturbed at the size of Government expenditure, whose ranks have been re--inforced by- the Budget.(b) The people who have-to pay Excess Profits Duty.( c)   The bankers who shouted for deflation until it same, and are now made uncomfortable by its effects.(d)   The financial and business world generally which had come to believe that tho trade boon would  -last for ever, .
3.   The .onl7-aceusartiona*-.agains^ -ItovOTnmeirt finance.-., which de-serve to be treated with respect are(a) the accusation of extravagance and(b) the accusation that Government financial policy is cheeking production%4.      The accusation of extravagance need not bodealt with here.     Pew of the critics fail to press for expenditure on their own pet plans.    But it may be v/orthreferring to Mr. McKennals charge that the Country &quot;cannot afford taxation to the extent of more than  1,000m. ayear.    This argument is an extraordinary one for a man of41Fir. McKenna!a standing,,    As stated by him it seemed to ignore entirely the fact that  500,000,000 a year goes to pay interest to the holders of the internal debt, and to assume that  20Cm, &quot;spent&quot; on repaying internal debt was inttihe same category as  200m. spent on absolutely non-productive Government expenditure.5.     I have been constantly on the look out for the slightest evidence- of any check on production.    A- policy of steady   deflation has to steer very gingerly between the Scylla of new inflation and the Charybdis of a financial crisis destroying credit and stopping-new production.    There are indeed some arguments in favour of a more violent remedy which though it might produce momentary dislocation would soon be followed by a fresh start on a considerably lower level of prices.     The policy of gradual deflation involves long months during which com-merco and industry is a prey to despondency.    The hope of quick profits owing to rising prices gives way to the fear of actual losses owing to the gradual fall in prices eating into the profits estimated for at the start of an operation%e
The danger of a check on production at present arises net from any real fear of over production. , There are potential demands all over the world sufficient to keep employment up to the highest level for a long time to come.&quot; The danger comes rather from the pscychclogical effect of falling prices on the natural optimism which seems to be essential to enterprise.   But so far with the possible exception of the boot trade there are no signs of failure &quot;of production and the Board of Trade confirm this view.    People like Sir Mackay Edgar whose grandiose speculations and plans for almagamations and mergers are stopped by the fear of Excess Profits Duty and the restrictions on credit always mistake the stoppage of their schemes (which do nothing in themselves to increase production and may frequently result only in needless competition for available materials and labour) for checking of production..But the returns of imports and exports tell an-other tale, and everywhere one hears that labour is grad-ually recovering from the prostration caused by the War and War efforts.   It is probable also that the signs of reduced private extravagance which the new state of mind and the absence of colossal profits is inducing among the employing class are reacting favourably on labour.   The check on the home demand- which has been brought about is undoubtedly contributing to increase exports.In truth the community as a whole stands to gain enormously from the improved standing of British credit, and the opposition even where honest is very short-sighted.
III.      Summing up one may surely claim $ha-t so farthere is every reason to be satisfied with the real euc-oeseeswhich have been obtained by the Government&apos;s unpopularfinancial policy.   That that policy will achievepopularity or will even be allowed any share in the &apos;credit for restoring sanity and stability to our financial situation is too much to hope.   But it will surely standthe verdict of history.   What is happening now isalmost exactly1 paralleled by the story of other epochs    /when (as a rule) the unpopular policy of deflationhas bowed to the storm.   The position in the unitedStates of America after the Civil War ended in a surrender to the unsound money party which retarded recoveryfor ten years.   In 1920 the United States of america is (so far) successfully adopting the sound money policy.It is all the more essential that the United kingdom should not fail.   The United Kinpdom has given the leadto the world and largely owing to the action of theUnited Kingdom the movement towards lower prices hasbecome world wide.   This fact adds to the gloom of theimmediate outlook here, but gives promise of an earlierrestoration of sound conditions than would otherwise bepossible. *-6-Treasury, S.W.,July 2nd 1920.
