THIS DOCTMflT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN 1,0......MAJESTY^ GoyEHITONyoiOWANCES FOR SINGLE MEN UNDERGOING TRAINING WHO HAVE DEPENDENT RELATIVES,Memorandum &apos;byi the Minister of Labour,*r- - x508* Further to the joint memorandum by the Minister&apos;of Pensionsl^i(J- and myself respecting a bonus of war pensions, I desire to call CuJtoswattent ion to a particular case of considerable hardship. In thecourse of my visits to Training Centres I have been impressed with the fact that a single man undergoing training and having dependent relatives, e*g. a widowed mother, is at a great disadvantage under existing regulations, particularly when he is living at home* Conferences of departmental officers concerned in the administra-tion of the Training Schemes have invariably called attention to the same case of hardship0Under present regulations a single man with dependent relatives living away from home may receive an allowance up to 17/6 a week in the same way as a married man with similar obliga-tions; further, whether away from home or not he may receive children!s allowances in respect of brothers and sisters whowere dependent on him before enlistmentsiWhilst there are other dependent relatives for whom a single man living at home receives no allowance, the case of the widowed mother   appears to me to deserve special consideration.I ask, therefore, that sanction should be given to pay as from July 1st 1920 the following allowance to a single man in training:-for a widowed mother dependent upon him and living at his home 10/- per week (corresponding)to the wife&apos;s allowance)*/ The cost of the above proposal is estimated at a total of B^OjOOQ for the duration of Training Scheme. This is only an approximation but is probably an outside figure *T * J * MACSAMARA*   v Ministry of Labour, ^22-6-20.
