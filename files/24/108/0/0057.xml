I desire to draw the attention of the Home Affairs Committeeto the First Report of the Departmental Committee on the Wholesale Food Markets of London.   It will be recalled that the Committee was set up in accordance with a decision of the Home Affairs Committee at a meeting held on 9th October, 1919. The London County Council had urged the Government to appoint a Departmental Committee to go into the question of market facilities, and had written to the Prime i Minister on the subject. The case for an enquiry was strongly press-ed at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee by my predecessor, Mr. G. H. Roberts.2, The more important findings of the Committee may be summarisedas followsj that Markets whioh were built 40 or 50 years ago are no longer capable of meeting the needs of London to-day, with its in-creasing population; that in the case of some of the Markets improve-ments and extensions- are urgently required which cannot be carried out under their present ownership and management; that in the case of other Markets the question of removal ought at once to be con-sidered; that the economical transport of produce to and from the Markets is dependent on the existence of good approaches and access t and that, in this respect, improvements in some cases are imperative), that any saving in the transport of foodstuffs thereby effected, would ultimately have the effect of bringing down prices to the con-sumer; that there is at present no one authority which has, so far as Greater London is concerned, power to create new Markets, or to improve, remove, or co-ordinate those now in existence.3.        Accordingly the Committee (with one dissentient) recommends:-(a) That market facilities ought to be administerednot in the interest of Private Owners or of Separate Local Authorities, but in the Public interest.(b) That full legal powers and full financial resources should be made available for that purpose.(c) That the administration of those powers should be vested in one Central Authority for the whole of Greater London.4. I strongly support this recommendation and suggest that authority should be given with as little delay as possible for the preparation of a Bill setting up the proposed Authority and provid-ing for its administrative and financial powers.5. If this recommendation is accepted the Port of London Act, 1903(8 Edw.7.Ch.68) naturally forms the precedent which in broad outline should &quot;be followed. It is proposed that the London Market Authority shall be a body corpa^ate with a Common Seal, having power to acquire compulsorily a^d hold land, buildings and market rights for its purposes. That it shall consist of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and other members appointed as may be determined. On this point I sug-gest that the first Chairman should be nominated by the Food Con-troller, that the Vice-chairman should be elected by the remaining members of the Authority as constituted, and that,the person to be
appointed to either such office may, but need not, be an appointed member. It is considered advisable that the various trades should not be directly represented on the Authority itself, which Should consist; o.f a small administrative body independent of the trading interests involved,6. It is suggested that the hvlmber of appointed members shall be25 in addition to the Chairman^ appointed as follows:-&apos;.By the Pood Controller 1. By the Minister of Agriculture &quot;and fisheries&apos; 2,&apos;  By the Minister of -Transport \; ,.   1*, . r. By the Board of Trade                 &apos;-.. -   1. ;. &apos;By the Corporation of the1 City of &quot;&apos;.London- [ 4? -By the London County Council 4* By the Minister of Health, representing   .    ....    London Local Authorities &apos;4J&quot;.... &apos; ; By the Minister of Labour, representing .           &apos; Labour- interests &apos;. 4.. ,By the London Chamber of Commerce   &apos; 3. ... By the Port of London Authority.;&apos;   : . (in respect of imports)     , . 1.The detailed provisions of the constitution of the Authority should be substantially the same as those set out in the first :&apos; schedule of the Port of London Act, 1908, subject to such modifica-tions as the altered circumstances require. It should however be noted that1 the provisions with regard to elections and qualificat-ions of electors will not be required if the constitution suggested above is accepted. It will be observed that representation of the consumers on an elective basis is secured by the provision of 12 representatives who will hold their seats in virtue of their elect- . ion to the Corporation of the City of London, the London County Council and the Local Authorities, and it Is suggested that for this reason.the persons, nominated by these bodies should be elected&apos; members. &quot; &quot;&apos;&apos; -------,    - W,        :,7* In order to provide a channel.by means of which the views ofthe various branches of the trades can be placed before the Market Authority, it is proposed that a Committee consisting of represent-atives of all classes of trades and labour concerned in each case should be set up for each wholesale market.under the Chairmanship, of a member of the Central Market Authority appointed by that Authority*,8* It is also proposed that power should be taken to pay out of the funds of the Authority the salaries of the Chairman,&apos;Vice-Chairman, Chairman of Committees or Sub-Committees, and such officers or staff generally as may be found to be necessary.-9.    ;.   It will be necessary as indicated in general terms in the-Committee!sreport to take specific powers to acquire existing market ----- rights and properties -whether held by public or private owners; to acquire ccmpulsorily any land, buildings or other property which may be needed for the extension or improvement of any market j to carry on, close or remove the markets as may be considered desirable; to make bye-laws and regulations for the conduct of the markets with -&quot;&apos;  legal power to enforce them; to modify or. determine any existing - agreements with users of the markets, to construct, equip, maintain or manage any warehouses, cold stores or other buildings which may exist or may be found to be necessary for public use in connection with the. markets; and to levy tolls, rates or charges as may be de- * ;:.  termined by the Market Authority on users of the market or on goods ffold or offered for sale within the area over which the market rights . extend or to which they may be   extended.
IQf,      -   It is suggested as; a matter of general principle that the Market Authority should have power&apos; to raise&apos; money for its- purposes by the issue of stock, but the financial side of the proposal will &apos; need careful and detailed expert examination.   For this purpose a small Committee, mightI smuggest, he appointed by His Majestyfs Treasury, who should be invited to make the&apos;necessary arrangements.11* It should be noted that the;above mentioned powers are askedfor only in connection with wholesale markets in which Fish, Fruit and Vegetables, Meat,: Poultry, Game, Eggs, and Rabbits are dealt with.&apos;  It is. not considered desirable that the Market Authority should exercise control over retail markets except so far as retail trading may be carried on within the actual market buildings acquired or to be acquired by them.    Retail markets, including street markets, will probably be better dealt with by the Loca&apos;1 Authorities concer-ned. .      (        &apos; ,;    ,.. &apos;l. g \ /&apos;      - -12. In advising the establishment of a Central Authority in pref-erence to any enlargement of the powers of existing market Authority ies or of the. London County Council, the Committee has been largely influenced by the consideration that their proposal is, in effect, directed to, the organisation of a very important department of Local Government;    The present needs for such organisation are urgent, and if at some future time a comprehensive scheme is carried out for the Government of Greater London, the Authority then established will be able to take over this Department as a going concern.13.      .    I desire also to call the attention of the Home AffairsCommittee to the second report of the Departmental Committee issued on the 10th May last.    This report deals specially with the waste of fish, and in that connection re-iterates the need for a radical Improvement in the present market facilities.    The Committee points out that serious waste is caused by delays in the railway transport of fish, especially in the cross-country traffic at the   junctions, and also in late arrivals at the markets.    Attention is drawn to the delays caused in delivery by the congestion of trie approaches to Billingsgate,&apos;and also to the want of provision of suitable storage facilities.    In the opinion of the Committee the essential remedies will be found in the provision of suitable rolling stock in adequate quantity, the improvement of the railway service in point of speed and punctuality, and, in the case of the London fish supplies, the simplification of the present slow, costly and cumbersome machinery for delivery, and a radical improvement of the present market facill-ties.CHARLES A.
