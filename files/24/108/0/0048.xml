^P 50-16) From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 27th June 1920.(Received 28th, 8 a.m.) !    .Clear the line.&apos; 788 S. Your telegram of the 24th June, P. 4838. Afghanistan. It was not suggested that payment of subsidy should commence simultaneously with opening of (? negotiations) and we would (? deprecate) this as showing undue eagerness on our part. There would certainly be provisions making payment conditional upon fulfilment of Afghan undertakings.; sOur views on the two points mentioned by you are as follows : (1) There is, of course, possibility that Amir may act as suggested but this is inherent in situation and cannot be avoided except by agreement over Amir&apos;s head between ourselves and Soviet Government. Dobbs has already (vide our telegram of the 8th June, No. 709), addressed grave warning to delegates of risk which they will run of incurring British enmity if they do not accept offer of friendship now made, and conviction now (corrupt1 group) them of superior wealth and stability of British Empire may overcome Afghans love of bargaining and impose restraint upon their demands. But if not, situation will certainly not be worse, than it would be if we ^refused to state our terms now. If Afghans did ultimately make exorbitant and truculent demands when negotiations took place, we should presumably refuse to continue negotiations and prepare to deal resolutely with any manifestations of hostility which might result.(2) There is no prospect of Afghans consenting formally to our controlling their foreign relations nor could we even hope to enforce such control without constant risk of war. Moreover, a paper control of foreign relations does not place us in any stronger position. War is only real sanction of such a condition. And if Afghans so conducted foreign relations &quot;as ^ to give us a casus belli, this would be equally operative without any paper condition, as with such condition. Further, under treaty conditions we should have probably often to look the other way when, a breach not amounting to casus belli occurred, as in Habibulla&apos;s time.Small breaches of conditions places in undignified position and lends colour to supposition no breach would rouse us from indifference. Hun somewhat on line of Anglo-Persian Treaty, British Governments promise to help in the development of the country but not stipulating for monopoly of the development. &apos; Clause regarding the subsidy could easily be so phrased as to make it clear that it would not be black-mail, but merely assistance granted towards development of Afghanistan as proof of interest taken by British Government in contentment and security of&apos;-neighbouring friendly nations. ... \&apos;We hope this expression of our views will satisfy His Majesty&apos;s Government that the policy we advocate is (? group omitted) and, that we may receive from you early intimation to this effect.Dobbs represents that Afghan delegates are showing greatest impatience and&apos; are being pressed from Kabul to return without&apos;delay.
