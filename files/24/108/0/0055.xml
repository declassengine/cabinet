The effectiveness of these measures much ia^reseed the Committee.A lengthy discussion and a full interchange of views followed which resulted in the general agreement of the Committee;   and, though on certain points there were differences of opinion, these were afterwards reconciled.The question of amending the Proclamations which had been made under the Crimes Act was raised (see Telegram from Chief Secretary to Lord Privy Seal - Appendix) and the Chief Secre-tary agreed to postpone, for the moment, tho request contained in his telegram.    The Committee asked the Chief Secretary to consider whether the same result could not be obtained by administration.The Chief Secretary undertook to prepare for the informa-tion of the Committee, when he is unable to attend the meet-ings, a short weekly report giving information which he mights consider would be of value, the report to contain also a short summary of his own views;   and, in any case, to furnish tho Committee with a weekly appreciation.The Committee have decided to meet once a week, when theIrish Situation will be reviewed and further reports will be made to the Cabinet..tehall Gardens, S.V/.1. , (Initialled)   W.

1   20APPENDIX.Copy of Telegram from the Chief Secretary for Ireland to&quot; the Lord Privy Seal, dated 22nd June, 1920.&quot;I think it would he in harmony with the Prime Ministerfo statement and your own,to the Labour Deputation last Friday if the Proclamations which have been made under the Crimes Act were amended,      Those Proclamations at present declare to be dangerous and unlawful all Sinn Fein and allied organisations, and not merely those known to be active in the organisation of crime.    This is a great embarrassment to us In administration for we cannot as a practical matter suppress all exprossions of Sinn Fein sentiment, and under the present conditions., therefore., the law is openly flouted every day, moreover., it is not consistent with the policy of His Majestyrs Government as we understand it to stifle the mere expression of political views and aspirations however obnoxious.     Hor can we ignore the fact that the local councils., which, in a wide sphere are the recognised instruments of&apos; Government., and are in receipt of largo Exchequer grants., containing now a preponderating Sinn Feinelement everywhere except in the north east,,    Vfe have been awaiting a suitable opportunity of taking this step.   I feel strongly that the opportunity has now arisen, and trust you and the Prime Minister will agree..   If so we will make an announcement at once,.     Macready and Anderson entirely concur in these views.     Please win reply..&quot;    Ends,.
