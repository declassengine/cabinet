\lf\ /Hi ft  /u*/&apos;Mfit&apos; Kf&apos;v/m36?THIS DOCUMENT IS MB PROFBBT? OP HIS BKITAHEICWDENTIAU,s for the Treatment of tuberculosis,li   The National Health Insurance Act, 1920, hasMemorandum by the\ Minister of Health,M.H.22.now been passed and provides, inter alia, for the discontinuance of sanatorium benefit. \  Insurance Committees will no longer have.the duty of providing treatment for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis, and it becomes essential, in order to secure efficient provision in every area, to introduce legislation imposing upon County and County Borough Councils the statutory duty of providing adequate institutional treatment.   I have already obtained the assent of the Government to this legislation and the necessary Bill is ready to be introduced.2.   When sanatorium benefit is discontinued, the Insurance Committees will no longer have any funds available for tuberculosis treatment, and I have been in correspondence with the Treasury for some months on the question of the Exchequer assistance which must be given to the County and County Borough Councils in lieu of the insurance money which they will now lose through the passing of the &quot;recent Insurance Act.    The Councils were urged by the Government in 191g to undertake schemes for.the institutional treatment of tuberculosis in reliance upon the promise that everything possible would be done to secure to them the funds available to the Insurance Committees for Institutional treatment, and most of the Councils have agreements with the Insurance Committees extending over a long term of years.   Those agreements must, of course, be determined when sanatorium benefit ceases, and under the recently passed Insurance Act I have power to do this by the issue of Regulations, At
v   368present the Councils receive, in addition to the funds whichthe Insurance Committees have available for institutionaltreatment, Exchequer grants amounting to 50 per cent of the balance of their expenditure, and I havo informed the Treasury thatj in my opinion, the minimum additionalgrant which can be offered to the Councils,   if we areto avoid charges of breach of faith, must be a block grantequivalent to the amounts whioh they will lose when theagreements are determined, so that the Councils will be inno worse position financially than they would have been ifsanatorium benefit had continued.If this proposal   is adopted, the Councils will receive the same financial assistance as now towards their present expenditure, and all additional expenditure will be shared equally between the rates and the Exchequer grant.3.   The Treasury take the view (in which I concur) that if a general scheme for the treatment cf tuberculosis by Local Authorities had been introduced prior to the National Insurance Act, 1911, there would have been no need to offer a higher grant than 50$   of the total cost of local schemes;   and they propose that an arrangement should now be made under which the annual grant to each Council in respect of the treatment of tuberculosis would be fixed at the total amount.actually received by the Council in the financial year en&amp;cd 31st March, 1920, either from the Insurance committee or the Government Grant, until such time as the expenditure of the Council justifies a higher grant on the 50  basis.   The effect of this proposal would be that all additional expenditure incurred by the Councils, in. excess of the expenditure during 1919**20, would be thrown on the rates until the additional expenditure exceeded their present income from Insurance funds.   I am satisfied that the
-   369adoption of this proposal would..Ju8tlfiably be regarded as a breach of faith on the part of the Government, and would have the effect of retarding, end in many cases completely stopping, ,the development of tuberculosis schemes.4,   At the suggestion of the Treasury, however, I have placed this proposal before the Associations of the Councils concerned and have conferred with representa-tives of the Associations.   Those representatives were unanimously of opinion that the offer of the Treasury was unfair to the Councils and a complete departure from the Government promise in 1912, They pointed out that the Councils had    undertaken the treatment of tuberculosis relying    upon the Government pledge as to the financial arrangements, end that the Government alone are responsible for the discontinuance of Sanatorium benefit.   %ey realised that considerable extensions of the tuberculosis service are required in most areas, and although they are willing that half the cost of those extensions should be found by the Gouncils, they protested strongly against the whole cost of extensions,, up to the amount of the Insurance committees present contributions, being thrown on the rates;   and they expressed the fear that, if the present proposal of the Treasury was adopted, there would bo an inclination in many areas to stop the development of tuberculosis schemes.5.   I agree with the, views of these representatives of the Councils, and am convinced that the adoption of the Treasury proposal would cause grave resentment and endanger the prospects of the successful development of tuberculosis schemes.The objections to that proposal may be briefly summarised -(1)   The Councils have undertaken considerable financial obligations in reliance upon the promise given by the Government in 1912 as to the assistance they would receive
receive from insurance funds and the Exchequer grant.(2) The Government are responsible for the decision to discontinue sanatorium   &apos; benefit and to determine the agreements under which the Councils receive the insurance funds available for the treatment of tuberculosis.(3) The cost of the Councils1 schemes must increase and developments of those schemes are necessary, and it is unfair to cast upon the Councils the whole of the increased cost up to the amount of the Insurance contribution which is now being withdrawn by the action of the Government*(4) If the Councils are not satisfied as to the future financial arrangements in regard to tuberculosis, it will be impossible to secure the necessary extensions and improvements in this service and there will be strong opposition in both Houses to the proposed legislation imposing a statutory duty upon the Councils to provide adequate institutional treatment.   As I have explained, such legislation is essential now that sanatorium benefit is to be discontinued, but I doubt whether it will be possible to obtain it in the face of the
formidable -oppos-itjLon-of tha-Associations representing the Councils.6i   I feel bound, therefore, to request the Government to agree to my proposal that, when sanatorium benefit ceases, the Councils should receive an Exchequer grant equivalent to the amounts they now receive from the Insurance Commit toot?, in addition to the present grant of 50 per cent, of their net expenditure after the deduction of the&apos; former grant.   This will involve ultimately an additional charge upon the Exchequer of about  275^000 per annum, in excess of tho charge which would result from the adoption of the Treasury proposal, but this    /amount will not be reached for some years.C. ADDISON. 7th July, 1920.Ministry of health. ,
