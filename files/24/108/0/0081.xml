/OCIB&amp;NT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT *prf,rPROPOSED STATE GRAifT IN AID OF VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH,I have to ask the attention of the Cabinet to the grave position of the voluntary hospitals throughout the country and the necessity of some assistance from public funds if the entire breakdown of the voluntary system is to be averted.    Prior to the war voluntary hospitals, in spite of difficulties in particular cases, were in.the main solvent, and the position was not materially altered until the rise of prices and the&apos; depreciation of currency be$an to be acutely felt in 1918.    The cost of maintenance had begun to rise before that year, but it was counterbalanced by an increase in Income attributable partly to payments in respect of military patients and partly to a progressive increase in subscriptions. , But by the end of 1918 the rise in cost of maintenance had overtaken the rise of income and in   1919 the situation was aggravated by the reduction in the number of military patients and a reduction of income from subscriptions attributable to the effects of Increased taxation and the rise in cost of living.    The war deficits were more serious in London than elsewhere and the King Edward Hospital fund calculate   the deficits on the London hospitals for the five years ending December, 1919, at  291,000,. the- bulk of these deficits having accrued in the last year of this period.    Complete statistics are not available in respect of the provincial hospitals, but Sir Kapler Burnett, Y^ho has been making a survey on behalf of the lied Cross, estimates the deficits up to the end of 1919 as follows:-England,         316,000Ireland,   .       84,000Wales, 19,000The/
The Scottish hospitals, owing to exceptionally large legacies, show a surplus, though individual hospitals, notably the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, are heavily in debt.    These figures, however, under-estimate the real position.    They are arrived at by treating all legacies as income, although in fact many hospitals have invested their legacies, and investments iri the earlier yeers of the quinquennium could now only be realised at a heavy loss. The amount of this depreciation would therefore have to be added to the estimated net deficit.     It is also to be remembered that legacies were not uniformly distributed between the hospitals that showed deficits, and it is therefore misleading to set off aggregate legacies against aggregate expenditure in the absence of any arrangement for pooling hospital funds.But the position at the end of 1919,   grave as it is, is not the most serious feature of the situation.     So far as London is concerned the war deficits will to a large extent be met by the decision of the King Edward Fund to distribute  250,000 of their invested funds.     But all hospital authorities are agreed that the rate of expenditure will be much higher during 1920 than it was in 1919.     Prices and wages have continued to rise and the demand for shorter working hours for the nursing staffs will entiil a serious increase of the wages bill in addition to expenditure on the provision of additional staff accommodation.     During the war practically all structural work had to be deferred, and the cost of carrying out the accumulated arrears of repairs and necessary extensions will be far higher than if the wDVk had been carried out in the ordinary course.The Red Cross Society, in conjunction with the King Bdward Fund, are organising a scheme for a co-ordinated appeal on behalf of all voluntary hospitals, which is designed to eliminate
eliminate the present competition and overlapping of rival appeals and to-draw subscriptions from a wider area of the community than has hitherto been reached.     The amount of new money required to be raised if the voluntary system is to be saved is, in my opinion, larger than a purely voluntary effort is likely to secure at any rate for the next two or three years.    The Chairmen of the London hospitals calculate that they will need  740,000 of new money to meet ordinary expenditure and  320,000 fo: deferred capital expenditure.     I believe these figures to bo inflated, but on the best judgment which I can at present form, London will need between  500,000 and  600,000 new money .fov   ordinary expenditure or practically double the 1919 deficit.    The provincial hospitals may well need at least as much new money as London, and in addition, the deferred capital expenditure, excluding London, is estimated by Sir Napier Burnett to amount to  500,000. ,The hew&apos;scheme Will necessarily take time to organise and, in rr.y opinion, it is essential that voluntary effort should be encouraged by a liberal State grant.     I therefore asked the Treasury to sanction a grant of  100,000 on condition that the aggregate of the voluntary subscriptions and donations raised for hospitals during 1920 amounts to no less than the total raised from voluntary sources during 1919, and a further grant, not exceeding  400,000 on the following terrast-(1)    50,000 for the first  100,000 by &quot;which the income fromvoluntary contributions for 1920 exceeds that for 1919. (2)    75,000 for the second  100,000 by which the income for1919 is exceeded. (3)    1 for  1 for any increase of voluntary contributions beyond the first  200,000.In/
In a few exceptionally urgent cases an immediate emergency payment may be necessary, but any such payment would be taken into Account in the subsequent distribution of grants/   This  -proposal the Treasury have now rejected, and I am informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is &quot;unable to accept&quot;the cost of hospitals as in any degree a national change.   In his opinion i.,othey are essentially local institutions and must look to local support^ whether public or private, for their maintenance0H   This view appears to mS wholl^ inconsistent with the health policy of recent years1 and 1 am at a loss to understand upon wha.t grounds hospital treatment should he regarded as a purely local Service in a year in which the Estimates provide for grants in England and Wales alone amounting to  1,800,000 for maternity and child welfare and the treatment of tuberculosis and venereal diseases, in addition to.a.special grant of  4,335,000 towards tHe oost of medical benefit undet1 the Insurance Ac^s. These grants sfceem to me to constitute ample recognition of the principle that the treatment of disease is &apos;a national .as well as1 a local charge, rlbi? can it be argued that State grants are limited to the treatment of... infectious diseases the spread of which may endanger the whole community, since it is obvious thai no such considerations apply to the grant in aid of medical benefit or to the State contribution to maternity and child welfare work and to the medical treatment of school children.&apos;  .I attach great importance to the maintenance of hospitals on a voluntary basis, not only because I am anxious to retain the services of the honorary medical staffs and of the unpaid lay administratorsbut also because 1 believe that the voluntary system is more economical than the alternative of either State or municipal hospitals*   If the voluntary system is allowed to collapse there will be an irresistible demand for t]ie hospitals to be taken over by the State or by the local authorities, Who will in that event unquestionably demandExchequer
Exchequer subsidies.   There is a growing agitation in favour of hospitals being maintained from public funds and this is tho avowed policy of tho Labour Party.   Nothing is more likely to reinforce this demand than to allow the voluntary hospitals to drift into bankruptoy-   If tho voluntary system is allowed to fail the Exchequer and the local ratepayer will be required to find not the half million for which I am now asking, but practically the whole of the cost of maintenance amounting tO&apos; not loss than  5,000,000 a year after allowing for endowments.The co-operation of the hospitals Is essential If any scheme of co-ordinated health: s orvices is to bo worked out, and the comparatively small grant for whioh I am now asking is not a long price to payoas a moans of securing that, measure of control which is essential if tho most effective use is to be made of the existing hospitals.   At present hospitals differ widely in their efficiency both from a clinical and from an administrative point of view, and in the larger urban areas, and.notably In London, they are often wrongly plsccd and there is no attempt at co-ordination or a proper definition of their respective provinces. Tho resulting waste and duplication of work cannot be eliminated unless the Ministry secures oome powor of supervision.    The experience of the university grants in relation to medical schools has shown the value .of supervision by a central authority in raising the general level of efficiency, and 7. believe a State grant in aid of general hospital   work would bo of tho greatestvaluo from this point of view.   Jly proposal is economical because it would avert the monaco of much larger demands on the Exchequer4.and I am confident that its positive advantages in securingco-ordination and a higher level of efficiency woul^make it intho
the long run remunerative.     It is unthinkable that the Institutional treatment of disease should be allowed to stop for want of a State grant, &quot;when it is recollected that at least  160,000 is to be spent on making a section of the Army mox^e attractive.C.
