v(SECRET.......jIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT .555IP. 11:54 3^   LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND TRADE UNIONS.L.G.32.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH *regret to have to trouble the cabinet again with reference to the action which certain local authorities now dominated by a Labour majority are taking in regard to their employees.P 1001.   0n       30th March I circulated a&apos; Paper drawing attention to Xhe action of certain Councils and Boards of Guardians who were endeavouring to force all their employees to join Trade Unions by discriminating between Unionists and non-Unionists in connection with increases of salaries and the merging of War Bonus in Wages. .The Home Affairs Committee considered this on April 14th, and took the view that such action was wrong and ought to be resisted;   but doubt was expressed as to how far the present powers of the Ministry .of Health would enable action to be taken.i * . ** &apos;J.I have had this point examined and am advised that the Ministry of Health have no powers which would enable them to deal effectively with the situation.    Indeed, my legal advisers suggest that it will probably be found impracticable to devise legislation which would -be effective, short of giving employees of looal authorities absolve security of tenure.    A Labour Council would it is feared ; be able to find various excuses for getting rid of non-Unionists and thus evade any legislation that may bo passed.i am constrained, however, to bring the whole matter before the Cabinet again, because Councils where Labour predominates are steadily pursuing a policy of coercion In regard to non-Union employees.    The Borough of Camborwell has recently issued the following notico in poster form:-&quot;THE COUNCIL ON THE 11th OF FEBRUARY, 1920, PASSED&quot;THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION,. V1Z:*-lTIIAT ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE COUNCIL BE MEMBERSOF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADE UNIONS.Frederick J. Slater.Borough EngineerI am informed that since the Issue of this Notice, there have been Trade Union Ticket inspections among the Councils * Employees by Trade Union Offi^datiI have considered whether the Auditor could surcharge the cost of printing this Notico as being contrary to public policy; but again I am advised against adopting this course, since in the present state of the law the Courts might upset such a surcharge on technical grounds.But in spite of the difficulties the issue seems to me to be one which must be faced by the Government.    The Labour Party who have secured majorities In seme of cur local councils are using&apos; their poser to force the employees of the local authorities into a particular form cf industrial organisation.    This, in my view is a dangerous invasion of the freedom of the subject, which should be checked now before it is too late.
X hope,, therefore? 13u&amp;1&amp;6^ theImmediate consideration of the Cabinet *    If xhe Cabinet- -decide that steps should be taken to deal with the situation, I suggest that the Law Officers should he asked to explore the question an  advise whether legislation oan he framed to prevent Councils from pursuing policies oot&amp;tfary to the personal freedom of their employees*Ministry of Health.C, ADDISON. 25.6*1920.
