(Previous Papers CP. 846, 1117, 1245 and 1357.)I ANNEX replies by Colonel Amery, M.P., and Mr. Darling to some of the objections made by the representatives of the Treasury in CP. 1245.The Treasury does not deny the dislocation which the war has caused in the currencies of the Empire, but treats them as, &quot;purely temporary results of the temporary loss of an effective gold basis for sterling &quot;; in effect, it says that as the United Kingdom will very quickly return to a gold basis, all the currencies will again become linked, and in the meantime no action need be taken.No one can pretend to prophesy when the United Kingdom will be able to allow the free import and export of gold, but having regard to the large amount of gold that India could absorb and the indebtedness of Europe to the United States of America, it is permissible to doubt whether twenty years will see equality between the pound sterling and the pound gold, if nothing is done to assist.If it be true that there is even a reasonable risk that for a long period each part of the Empire will develop its own currency exchangeable at fluctuating rates with the pound sterling, it is surely worth while, before the differences become pronounced, enquiring whether means cannot be found for linking the whole producing strength of the Empire in one system, not merely to avoid differences within the Empire, but also to ensure that the Empire shall stand together in the battle with the dollar.A common currency is as valuable for Empire trade as a common language is for political intercourse.By delay we risk introducing a veritable Babel into our Empire trade.India has just removed the restrictions on the import of gold, the effect of which on the Empire gold reserves may well be disastrous. India is pursuing her policy without regard to the Empire&apos;s interests, The South African pound is at a premium over the British pound sterling, and it is not improbable that the Australian and New Zealand pound may follow suit when the prices of their principal raw products have ceased to be controlled.I agree with the Treasury that if this were a mere passing phase to last a year or perhaps two, it might not be worth facing the great difficulties of finding a unified system,, but I believe the free market in gold in the United Kingdom may have to be postponed for many years, and that the quickest method of re-establishing it is to link up the whole Empire in its support, so that I urge my colleagues to take steps to have an enquiry made, as suggested in my paper CP. 1117.(Initialled)        L.

Imperial Exchange and Currency.Memorandum by Colonel L. S. Amery.I hope I may be pardoned for suggesting that the Treasury Memoranda which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has. circulated (CP. 1245) cannot be regarded as disposing of the arguments in favour of a unified and stable system of exchange and currency in the British Empire.Mr. R. G. Hawtrey&apos;s Memorandum on the general subject is apparently based on the assumption that a fall in exchange arises only as a consequence&apos; of currency inflation, presumably with the corollary that a rise in exchange must be due to actual or relative currency deflation. But this is only one of the causes of exchange fluctuations. A large excess of imports over exports, or vice versa, affecting the exchange, may be due to causes entirely disconnected with internal currency questions. Our huge imports from America during the last five years have been due to war necessities, and have not been a mere incidental consequence of the printing of Treasury notes. Again, exchange may be influenced by a variety of factors, moral and physical, which encourage or discourage trade. The German and Austrian exchanges stand at a level out of all proportion to the actual internal inflation in those countries, and are an index not so much of that inflation as of the uncertainty of their future. These exchanges and, indeed, our own exchange with America have fluctuated very considerably in recent months from all sorts of causes unconnected with the local supply of currency. Lastly, there is the exchange fluctuation which arises in. the case of metallic currencies from changes in the commodity value of the metal of which they are composed, of which the Indian exchange is the most familiar example.All these causes of exchange fluctuations are present in the international and inter-Imperial situation to-day, and are likely to continue to be present for many years to come. And this is the whole essence of the problem and is entirely ignored in the Treasury Memoranda whatever the cause, these fluctuations are an obstacle and discouragement to trade and to investment. Every contract under such conditions is a gamble on the part of either buyer or seller. Goods and capital are both held back, the one because by the time they are paid for the transaction may prove a loss, the other because both capital and interest may be drastically diminished by causes entirely disconnected with the actual merits of the investment.On the other hand none of these obstacles to genuine trade and enterprise, or encouragements to undesirable speculation, exists within the area of a single currency or fixed exchange system. AH the factors which create exchange fluctua-tion are automatically eliminated wherever the same monetary token or unit of value is recognised by the administration or the courts as legal tender or of the same statutory value. There is no gambling in exchange involved at this moment in trade between Vancouver and Montreal, between London and Liverpool, ,between Bombay and Calcutta, and no one would dispute that that is a good thing as far as it goes. Surely it must also be a good thing if we could eliminate gambling in exchange between Montreal and London or between London and Bombay. Apart from all question of the advantages of a low exchange or a high, exchange with the outside world, that in itself would, I still venture to suggest, be a most effective and politically non-contentious form of Imperial preference.The. Treasury Memoranda assume that this enxiety to secure stability is unneces-sary because it will be attained in any case by the restoration in every part of the Empire of the gold standard. But in the first place, it is still entirely uncertain when the gold standard can be restored. At any moment events may take place which might postpone its restoration for months or even years. The repayment of our debt to America will, in itself, steadily tend to prevent the exchange recovering. In the second place, the stabilising of the different currencies of the Empire to gold, when it is achieved, will not, of itself, give the full advantages of a unified currency and exchange system, for in the absence of sufficient supplies of gold, stability can only be maintained by frequent recourse to such an artificial device as the raising of the bank rate, which directly interferes with trade in order to shore up an inadequate medium of exchange. All the gold we are likely to get will be wanted for interna-tional purposes, and it will help both the international and the Imperial trade of each part of the Empire, if it can be dispensed,with for the regulation of inter-Imperial exchanges.In CP. 1117 two methods for securing the object of a stable exchange and an
Imperial currency system were suggested. Without claiming to be competent to expound or defend Mr. Darling&apos;s scheme, the criticism of it is a little wide of the mark. The essence of the scheme, as I understand it, is the setting up of a banking institution, which will give uniform exchange at par throughout the Empire and which will be authorised by the Government of each part of the Empire to issue local notes, or a common Imperial note, in payment of these exchange transactions. The particular proposal to limit these issues to cover self-liquidating bills of exchange may not be an absolute check on inflation, though I cannot follow Mr. Haw&apos;trey&apos;s argument when he suggests that bills drawn on. the actual sale of commodities intensify the inflation. In any case the consequences he anticipates could only follow if there were, in fact, a simultaneous condition of inflation in every part of the Empire an event much less probable than a condition of inflation in a single country. No doubt, too, that feature of the scheme is not incapable of modification. Nor, I imagine, is it essential that the proposed Empire bank should be a Government institution, as long as the interests of every part of the Empire were represented upon it, and so long as its notes were recognised by the various Governments concerned. After all exchange is, at this moment, being kept level between England and Australasia, and more or less level between England and South Africa, purely by the action of the banks. All that is required is that what is now done partially and almost at haphazard should be done for the whole Empire and as part of a general Imperial policy of economic development.The alternative method of eliminating exchange, viz., the issue of a definitely fixed quantity of Imperial notes made legal tender at par in each part of the Empire, is not discussed in the Treasurv Memoranda. Whether those notes were issued in a fixed proportion to the outstanding note issues of the Empire, which would be exchanged for them, or whatever the principle on which their total amount and allocation were decided, they would, when once issued, have, for inter-Imperial purposes at least, just the same value as an &quot; automatic &quot; basis of currency as gold. It is true the amount might be increased by further joint agreement of all the Governments of the Empire. But there is no reason to believe that these Govern-ments are likely to go in collectively for a policy of wholesale inflation. On the other hand over-inflation of the local note issued by any particular Government would have an automatic check in the tendency of the Imperial notes to leave the country, just as gold does under similar conditions.The point at which the exchange should be stabilised in those cases where it is at this moment unstable does undoubtedly present real difficulties. But they ought not to be insuperable. The Indian Government has, after all, attempted to do this very thing in. refixing the exchange value of the rupee. Only it has added to the difficulty of the task by trying to fix the rupee, not in relation to sterling which we do control, but to gold which we do not control, and has so far failed to secure stability with either. As a matter of fact with the present silver value of the rupee at Is. 10ld. and exchange value at 2s. ljd. there would seem to be no practical difficulty in fixing it at 2s. sterling.The case of Canada is in some ways the most difficult, though even there I suggest that it is somewhat rash to say, as, Mr. Blackett does, that practical people in Canada would not seriously consider fixing their exchange to sterling. The same argument might be applied against the idea that Canada should prefer a scheme of fiscal preference with this country to one with the United States, but the fact remains that she does, and what is more, believes it to be economically as well as politically a sound policy. The present moment when the Canadian exchange with New York has, in fact, broken down, is obviously the most favourable for such a change. And if the advantages, from the point of view of production and export, of a sudden pegging down of the Canadian dollar to 4s. were not considered sufficient to outweigh the disadvantages, it would always be feasible to proceed by stages, gradually widening the exchange gap between the American and Canadian dollar and bringing the latter down to its final sterling equivalent.The Treasury Memoranda are especially critical of the suggestion that a low Empire exchange with the outside world involves a stimulus to Inter-Imperial trade and to export outside the Empire.&apos; It is perfectly true that the effect in this direction is temporary, and is gradually checked by changes in internal prices. But the readjustment may take several years, and during those critical years of economic reconstruction, our whole future position in the world will be settled. The Treasury argument on this aspect of the question is, I may say in passing, weakened by the
assumption to which I have already referred, that exchange phenomena are only reflections of internal inflation or deflation of the currency.In any case, it is not a question of artificially keeping down our exchanges for the sake of the stimulus and protection afforded, out only of not taking too extreme measures to hasten to force them up. Mr. Hawtrey admits the danger involved in too rapid a deflation, and points out the serious restriction of trade and activity which may follow a sudden fall in prices. But he overlooks what is the greatest practical obstacle in the way of rapid deflation at the present day. Labour is in no mood to accept any reductions in money wages, even if accompanied by a&apos;fall in general prices, and any attempt to bring down general prices quickly without bring-ing down wages would bring induistry to a standstill. On the other hand, we,may hope, within a reasonable number of years, to see such an increase both of total production and of individual efficiency, as will warrant the retention of the present scale of wages even with a very considerable fall in general prices.(Signed)&apos;.     L. S. AMERY.Imperial Exchange and currency. Notes by Mr. J. F. Barling&apos; on the Memoranda contained in CP. 1245.I.- We claim that the Empire system can get us back to a gold standard sooner than the policy of the Cunliffe Committee, which policy, moreover, is fraught with great danger.r,i Currency settled down or pegged down in terms of gold.&quot; With the American debt blocking things, there will be no settling down in terms of gold for some time. The Empire system is, we hold, well calculated to shorten the transition period. Thus we would have conditions which would &quot; Act as a strong stimulus on exports and a protection for home industries &quot; only it would then be a strong stimulus on Empire exports and a protection for Empire industries.India. We did not suggest the stabilization of the rupee at Is. 4d. but at 2s. sterling. If the attempt to fix the rupee at 2s. gold (which by the way is so far a fiasco) is a move towards an Imperial Currency, of what benefit is that if it helps to retard the Empire from reaching that standard ?Canada. The points raised are more for Canada to decide and can be discussed with her &quot; at a Conference and also beforehand.&quot; They are undoubtedly important, as much for Canada as for us. Looking ahead a bit, the time might come when for Canada it would be Empire or a closer connection with the United States. Even her banking reserves are mainly kept in the United States. If she joined the Empire system, these would be transferred to London. She would (also have the benefit of cneaper money and a more even flow of it for her trade and renewal of War Loans. Her trade with the rest of the Empire would have time to develop as against the United States during the transition period, and before gold parity was reached. So there would be set-offs.  There must necessarily be some give and take.But I cannot help thinking that Canada would be willing to help us to bear the heavy burden of this American war debt if the situation were placed before them from that point of view.When Mr. Hawtrey writes of reversing cause and effect, he is dealing with a very disputed point. Just how much is cause and how much effect is most difficult to determine. He goes on to say that if the exchange produce an actual excess of exports, that can only mean we are lending abroad. &quot; The granting of credits is the cause, because without it the adverse exchange could not continue.&quot; But would paying off debt abroad not be an exactly similar cause \ With, then, this American debt and interest to settle, the adverse exchange will continue. In face of this, will Mr. Blackett be good enough to inform us just in what way the policy of the Cunliffe Committee, which, he says on p. 1, the Treasury are steadily pursuing, is going to get us &quot;from a State regulated currency back to the gold standard.&quot; And again, &quot;how they are going to restore the gold basis of sterling,&quot; which may come about much sooner than seems to be expected by the writers of the memorandum.At the end of his memorandum Mr. Hawtrey says: &quot; But undoubtedly, if symptoms either of unemployment or of a commercial crisis developed, it would be
undesirable to push deflationary measures so far as to transfer the steady flow of production.&quot;A crisis can develop very rapidly. Mr. Hawtrey may be too late. High taxation about as high as can be borne, if not higher plus a calculated system of deflation, is a strong combination for a &quot;steady flow of production &quot; to fight against.II.* mr . Hawtrey&apos;s first objection to the Empire bank is that there would have;to be a new measure of inflation in the countries in the Empire whose exchanges are unfavourable for us, so as to reduce the value of their currency units in terms of sterling to par. I would suggest that the Empire system, providing as it does for a very rapid ebb and flow of currency equally open to all parts of the Empire, would result in some inflation for them and some deflation for us until we met. But so wide is the area over which we have to work, and so easy in its working is the machinery that is proposed, that the effect of such movement would probably not be greatly felt.With regard to the cure for the exchanges, which Mr. Hawtrey says I assume can only be effected by increased production and exports, I would add a diminution of imports (of course, by exports and imports one includes invisible as well as visible). The Empire is then treated as a united whole, endeavouring as far as possible to supply its own wants and, on balance, producing a surplus towards payment of the debt to America, being aided in this for the time being by the unfavourable exchange.The purchasing power of the currency unit in terms of commodities, which Mr. Hawtrey calls the fundamental factor in correcting exchanges, is made up of two factors, one relating to currency and the other to commodities. One school, to which Mr. Hawtrey evidently belongs, holds that the main cause of the rise in prices is the increase in currency or purchasing power; the other that the cause of the rise is mainly the great decrease in the supply of commodities brought about by the cessation and diversion of many lines of supply, and actual destruction caused by the war. I adhere to the latter view, and therefore hold very strongly that to increase the supply of commodities is of the first importance, and that, whatever measures of deflation may be considered necessary require to be undertaken with the greatest care, otherwise we may experience a set-back that may take a lot&apos; of making up.Meanwhile, banks are near the end of their tether in granting advances, It may be that since the armistice these advances have been made too liberally. If so, this was due to a desire on the part of the banks to help trade, which on all hands they were urged to do; and also to some extent perhaps to competition. Measures of deflation have been put in hand through the tightening of money, with, however, no relief in prospect save after a further rise in the bank rate until presumably 10 per cent, is reached, and then the issue of further paper with nothing tangible behind it. If I may be pardoned for further criticism, the policy of the cunliffe Committee is now fraught with considerable danger, because conditions have altered and the report is out of date. The exchanges had not then gone to pieces, and throughout the argument in the report there runs the idea that the movement of gold, out and in, would, if not immediately, then very soon, be again effective. There is no early prospect of this. It may, indeed, take a long time. It is difficult to see how it can be effected until the American debt is materially reduced. Funding interest or postponing payment of principal of that debt will not do it, because for one thing the moral effect of the great weight of the debt would prevent exchange from reaching gold point. The debt must be reduced to such a figure that there can be no reasonable doubt as to our ability to meet it, before an effective gold standard is even in sight. The pursuance of the Cunliffe report policy under present conditions is the pursuance of only half a policy^the deflation end without the possibility of the gold relief  and, I venture to think, is dangerous in the extreme.We shall now take up Mr. Hawtrey&apos;s criticism on the self-liquidating bill of exchange as the basis for the Imperial currency. It can do little good to go back 100 years, when conditions were very different. We have before us the British Empire and all that it implies. But we take up most readily the alleged flaw in the bill of exchange of to-day (not of 100 years ago) ,which is proposed as a basis for the Imperial curency. We shall also deal with the reference to the Federal Reserve Board. First of all, let us see what the position of the American system is, and how far it differs from the proposed Empire bank system.In the United States the banks number many thousands (I think well over 30,000 distinct institutions), branch banks being practically non-existent.   They are of all
sorts and conditions. But I think it is only the National banks that are required by law to become members of the Federal Reserve Banks, though many Trust companies and State banks have joined this system. The last statement showed a membership of 9,161 institutions. The Federal Reserve banks discount for their member banks bills and notes for &apos;&apos; agricultural, industrial or commercial purposes, or the proceeds of which have been used or are to be used for such purposes.&quot; Bills drawn against investment securities are not eligible except against securities of the United States Government. There are various restrictions, based on its capital and surplus, on the amount of paper any one member bank may have outstanding. For this mass of paper the Federal Reserve banks obtain from the Federal Reserve Board currency notes with, however, the restriction that the Federal Reserve banks must hold 40 per cent, of its circulation, in gold.   The notes are also payable in gold.This paper represents mainly the internal trade of the country, the foreign trade proportion being very small, and Mr. Hawrtrey&apos;s criticism that several bills may be simultaneously in existence against the same lot of commodities applies, and I also admit that the increase in prices of commodities (however brought about) increases the face value of the bills drawn against them. The Federal Reserve system must also find it difficult to control so many different member banks of such varying calibre. But the principal blot/ in the working of the system is in the admission of bills or notes drawn against Government securities. After the United States entered the war these notes were largely drawn in order to assist the flotation of war loans. The following extract is from the Federal Reserve Bulletin for April 1920: &quot; Hold-ings of discounted paper on the last Friday in February totalled 2,453,511,000 dollars compared with 2,174,375,000 dollars on the last Friday in January and 1,879,820,000 dollars at the end of February 1919. About 65 per cent, of paper held about the end of the month under review was made up of war paper, compared with about 67 per cent, at the end of January and 89 per cent, at the end of February of last year.&quot; That is to say, at the end of February 1920 the Federal Reserve banks held discounted war paper to the extent of in round figures 1,600,000,000 dollars.Now the self-liquidating bill of exchange, which it is proposed&apos; should be the basis of the Imperial currency note, is a very different instrument. It does not include war paper; war paper representing the internal trade of any part of the Empire; it only includes bills drawn against goods shipped (a.) From one part of the Empire to another part of the Empire. (&amp;.) From a part of the Empire to a foreign country. (c.) From a foreign country to a part of the Empire;and a proportion even of this trade is settled by cable transfers and demand drafts.The method would be that the bill must be accepted (payable in London) by a customer bank or banking house, through whose hands or through the hands of whose agent the shipping documents would pass. The acceptor would mark the bill in a way to be arranged so as to clearly indicate that the conditions had been complied with, and that the bill was eligible for discount at the Empire bank. The responsi-bility for this would rest with the acceptor. Any wilful marking of wrong paper, which, considering the standing of the acceptors, is unthinkable, would bear a penalty-let us say a request to close the account with the Empire bank. The bank presenting the bill for discount must also be a customer of the bank and be other than the acceptor. There could not be more than one bill or set of bills in existence simultaneously against the same consignment. (A re-export would be a separate transaction.)Mr. Hawrtrey goes on to say: &quot;The real fkw in the self-liquidating bill of exchange is that any tendency to inflation increases the prices of commodities and increases therefore also the face value of the bills that may be drawn to finance a given consignment.&quot; But in the case we are considering the goods must be actually produced in the first place; they must then reach the ship and the shipping documents be handed either to the buyer or the bill for despatch with the bill, or to the acceptors agent at the port; the bill goes forward, in most cases to London, and, anyhow, days and more often weeks elapse before it reaches the acceptor and is accepted. Then it must reach another bank and may be held for a time in that bank&apos;s portfolio, and, finally, if and when that bank is in need of currency, it is turned into notes. By what process of reasoning can the relationship between these goods, which in all likelihood have also been soM, and that bill, cause inflation or a tendency to inflation ?Further, all banks will be eager holders of self-liquidating bills, but because they are interest-bearing they will only turn them into currency as the currency is
actually required. The system will1 produce great economy of currency and credit. There are also only joint-stock banks in the British Empire. But a further memorandum on the rate of interest and dealing also with the relationship between the Empire bank and its customer banks, is being prepared and will show more fully the well nigh automatic working of the Imperial currency.There is more fear of the Imperial currency under the conditions described not being sufficient than of its being in excess; and it is a question how and to what extent the basis might have to be widened. ,  ;Mr. Hawtrey goes on to throw cold water on the proposal to issue 3-pe.r cent. Empire loan certificates to the banks in exchange for redundant currency of the existing local issues. From the nature of his criticism I can only conclude that he has omitted to notice that these certificates are to be free of all taxes in any part of the Empire. When one considers British income tax at 6s. and super tax up to 6s., there can, I. think, be little doubt as to the popularity of this security if the banks were prepared to sell. To the big super tax payer it would be equal to a 6 per cent, investment with income tax and super tax and any other tax compounded at 10s. It provides him, too, with a certainty. But banks are likely to retain the certificates; their borrowing facilities are very valuable, and in addition the yield to a British bank, for example, would be equal to fully 4J per cent, with income tax compounded at 6s., while any corporation tax would make the gross yield still higher. There is also the super tax payer ready to snap up any that may be offered in the market. Here again the terms appear if anything too liberal.With regard to Mr. Hawtrey&apos;s remarks about the Bank of England, the writer fully appreciates all that the Bank of England has done and the value of its traditions. But in the present rearrangement of things there can be no resting on tradition. The future is with the Empire, as is being increasingly acknowledged, and the opportunity is now given to the Bank of England to maintain, and even enhance, its great position as the bank of the British Empire. The maintenance of the best of its traditions is surely not incompatible with the supreme position it will then occupy.Mr. Hawtrey then points out that the working of the Empire bank system is not very different to pre-war conditions. Apart from the working proving, 1 venture to think, much more rapid, and through its numerous and immediate set-offs much more economical in the use of credit, there is a most important change which Mr. Hawtrey has overlooked. With reference to pre-war conditions, he says: &quot;Each Dominion regulated its currency by reference to its relations with London.&quot; This is not the case with Canada, whose banking reserves are mainly kept in New York, which is, in effect, the clearing house for Canada&apos;s financial transactions. While the Canadian banks have gained to some extent through having their cash reserves and short money in United States dollars, they must now be subject to great inconvenience through these reserves being in a fluctuating currency. It is absolutely essential for the smooth and economical working of a banking system that the reserves in short-time money should be stable and not subject to abnormal exchange fluctuations, which might involve serious loss. Under the Empire bank system these reserves would for the greater part be held in London under conditions of entire stability as regards exchange. The transference of Canadian banking reserves from New York to London would also provide a set-off and help to strengthen the sterling-dollar exchange. In all likelihood there would be an upward movement in anticipation. But politically the effect would be of the greatest importance. It is far from desirable that the banking reserves of such an important part of the Empire as Canada should be kept in a foreign country.With regard to India, may I be permitted a personal note. I was resident in that country, from 1886 to 1899, and witnessed the fluctuations in exchange caused&apos; by the Bland Silver Bill; the closure of the Mints to silver and the many upheavals between that time and the stabilisation of the rupee at Is. id. I was in the thick of it, and it fell to my lot to study the subject somewhat closely, and to comment upon it. On the other hand, I have been out of touch with India since. Somehow or other the impression on my mind is this, that given time and time is not of the same importance in the.East, and conditions take longer to work out-but given time, and India will either break with or upset any currency system that attempted to attach her. I cannot argue this out; I merely give it as an impression, which may be valueless. But so far the history of the rupee has proved how difficult it is to control. To-day exchange conditions in India are very troublesome.   But the fall in silver
may help the siutation, and lead for a time, at least, to a stable rupee on the basis of 2s. sterling, which figure is has nearly reached.In my memorandum I suggested a further study of the question in its relation to the Empire, and that in the meantime we might go on with Great Britain, the Dominions and the Crown Colonies and Protectorates, and if desirable India could join or be affiliated later.I would just like to add that if the Imperial currency note does, not go into circulation, but is used as a basis for any extension of existing currencies, the actual setting up of the Empire bank system, with the Bank of England as the foundation, need not be a prolonged affair.(Signed)       J.
