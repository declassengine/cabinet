Worn Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,2&amp;Ji June 1920.Clear the line.P. 4838. Your telegram of 19th June, 759 S. Afghanistan. I understand your present recommendation to be revival of second proposal submitted in last paragraph of your telegram of 30th April, 522 S., and that what you now ask for is authority to inform Afghans that in event of negotiations for treaty of friendship taking place we will pay them subsidy of 18 lakhs in return for satisfactory assurances as to (lj cessation of intrigues with tribes; (2) denial of Afghanistan as focus for hostile influences; and (3) non-encouragement of Indian agitators. I agree with you that situation has changed since my telegram of 4th May was sent, aud I accept your view that there is sufficient evidence of improved Afghan attitude to justify reconsideration of decision then conveyed to you. I understand you lo propose that subsidy should become payable immediately negotiations start. If so it would of course, be pro-visional only and would be liable to discontinuance in event of negotiations breaking down. Treaty, if and when concluded, will, I presume, contain provision making-continued, payment conditional on due fulfilment of undertakings indicated above. On this understanding I sanction your proposal, if immediate action is absolutely necessary. But if possible I should like your views on two following points by clear the line telegram before anything is said to Afghans. (1) If we are to bid for Afghan friendship, bid must be large &quot;enough. Have you considered situation that will arise if Amir uses offer to bargain with Bolsheviks, and as result of them counter offer raises his terms ? (2) Subsidy is open to objection unless in return for control of foreign relations. Have you considered possibility of loan and treaty on lines of Anglo-Persian agreement ?
