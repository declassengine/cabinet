T!&quot;h Docum^t h the Property of .rH       :inirU i;3Sty&apos;3 Government.-- .    ,  3gfiRccjred to Comir,ittee of Home AffairsConfidential.Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Bill.MEMORANDUM.It is proposed by this Eill to make certain amendments in the Irish criminal injuries code, in order to remove the difficulties which have arisen owing to existing conditions in Ireland.There has been a great increase in the number of claims for compensation in respect of murder, injuries to property, and injuries to the person, and large sums have been awarded by county court judges and judges of assize against the councils of counties in which the injuries have been inflicted. Even in normal circumstances the injured person cannot enforce payment of the amount awarded to him until a rate for the purpose has been made and collected by the local authority, and in the present year a number of councils have refused to levy any such rate, particularly in cases where a policeman or Government official ha,s been murdered or injured, or Government property has been -damaged.The existing procedure for enforcing payment is antiquated and expensive, and it is within the power of a recalcitrant council to protract the proceedings indefinitely. It is accordingly proposed in the present Bill to afford a summary and more effective means of enforcing payment, and, as it may be anticipated that certain councils&quot; will resort to every possible expedient to avoid discharging these liabilities, a number of alternative remedies are provided for the purpose, viz.:Under clause 1 the treasurer of a county council is required on demand to pay the amount out of moneys under his control, or, if those are insufficient, out of the first moneys coming to his hands. This merely extends to compensation awards of a provision in section eighty of ,the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which already applies in the case of ordinary judgment debts or statutory liabilities of a county council.Under clause 2 the Lord Lieutenant is empowered, where he is satisfied that immediate payment of the amount cannot otherwise be obtained, to make an order for intercepting pay-ments which otherwise would be made to the council out of196-3 A
Criminal Injuries (Ireland).   [10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5.&quot;the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account or some public fund or parliamentary grant, and for applying the same in payment of the amount. Under the existing law the payment of debts&apos;due to the Crown or to any Government department by a council may be secured by intercepting sums payable to the council out of that Account, and, in effect, the clause proposes to place the amounts recovered for criminal injuries in the same position as debts due to the Crown; but inasmuch as* the payments from the Local Taxation Account may not be sufficient for the purpose, it extends the power of interception to any public funds or parliamentary grants payable to the council.Clause 3 enables a person who has obtained a decree for compensation for criminal injuries to apply to the High Court for an order attaching the rates payable by any ratepayer. Under the existing law rates are not attachable at the instance of a judgment creditor (Murphy v. Belmullett Union, 22, L.R.I.).Under clause 5 a council is empowered to strike a rate at any time of the year for raising the compensation instead of waiting until the beginning of the next financial year. &quot;With a view to avoiding an excessive burden being placed upon the ratepayers in one year, the same clause authorises a council to borrow money for the payment of compensation, with the approval of the Local Government Board, the amount being repayable by instalments spread over a term of years. In the case of poorer counties, i.e., congested district counties, the Lord Lieutenant is empowered to direct that the amounts, instead of being payable on demand, are to be payable by instalments extending over a period not exceeding five years.It is proposed also to make certain amendments in the procedure under the criminal injuries code, as regards extension of time, &amp;c. (clauses 6 and 7).
