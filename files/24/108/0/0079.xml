S. GThe War Office,7 th July, 1920.MEMORANDUM BY THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. This Bill was originally submitted to the Cabinet on 12th March, 1920 Gen. No. 8 (CP. 854).   The Home Affairs Committee considered it at their 53rd Meeting, and     892 requested that it should be reconsidered with a view to the preparation of a new draft restricted in scope and with a title more closely drawn.It was accordingly re-submitted on the 4th May, 1920, with three of the original five clauses omitted (C.P. 1224). The Committee then agreed at their 62nd Meeting that an additional clause, amending Section 13 (2) (b) of the principal Act, should be inserted, relating to the retention of possession and acquisition of land belonging to railway companies, and that the three clauses omitted should be restored.2. A new question of the greatest importance has since arisen with regard to the power of the Crown to acquire land for re-sale, and a further clause has been drafted to deal with this point and certain other points with regard to which, in Counsels opinion, the Crowns position is open to doubt.I attach herewith a revised draft of the Bill (imprint of 25th June, 1920) in which these additions have.been embodied as Clause 3 (1) (a),(b), (d) and. (e), and (2); 3 (1) (c) was approved in the drafts previously submitted.Clause 3 (1) (a).3. In order to prevent valuable buildings and other structures built at the expense of the Government reverting to the owners of land on which they have been erected or being sold at mere scrap value, it is essential that Government Departments should have the power of compulsorily acquiring land on which such buildings have been so erected, for the express purpose of immediately selling the land with the buildings thereon. It has hitherto been assumed that this power was conferred by the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916.The Law Officers have now, however, advised that it is doubtful whether the Act gives any power to acquire land compulsorily for the purpose of re-sale and the Bailway and Canal Commission has expressed a strong opinion to the same effect in a case (Minister of Munitions v. Mackrill) decided by them on 1st July, 1920, which was the first case in which the point arose before them. A transcript of the judgment in that case is attached.This creates a very serious position which may result in the loss of many millions to the Exchequer.It is estimated that the outstanding cases of this kind with which the Disposal Board are dealing involve more than 10,000,000^., and cases in which Government buildings have already been sold to the owners of the sites at substantial prices in consequence of the Governments reputed power of purchase for re-sale have also involved several millions.It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the doubt as to the power of the Crown in this matter should be removed by legislation at the earliest possible moment.(B20/309)  70 7/20  h&amp;s  8S72wo ,
Clause 3 (1) (a) as it stands would only cover purchases of land on which buildings have been erected. It would not authorize purchases of land to-avoid cost of reinstatement (which sometimes exceeds the value of the land) nor would it authorize the purchase of adjoining land which might be essential for the use of the buildings. If, however, the last four lines (from &quot; re-sale &quot; onwards) were omitted both these difficulties would be removed.   I, therefore, recommend the omission of these lines.Clause 3(1), (6) and (e).4. In certain cases property taken under Defence of the Realm powers has been occupied at different times by various Government Departments, some of them being. Departments to whom a transfer is not authorized by Section 1 (4) of the Act of 1916. A doubt has been raised as to which Department is, in such circumstances, the occupying Department, and the Law Officers have advised that in many cases there is no occupying Department. Sub-paragraph (b) makes it clear that in the Act of 1916 &quot;Government Department in possession&quot; and &quot;occupying Department&quot; mean the Department for the time being in possession, and sub-paragraph (e) makes it clear that Section 1 (4) of the Act is not intended to limit the power of one Government Department to transfer possession to another.Clause 3(1) (d).5. This sub-paragraph&apos;has been drafted to remove doubts which have been raised (i) as to the power of the Ministry of Transport to authorize the retention of railway or dock property by a Government Department after the war under Section 13 (2) of the Act of 1916, except for the purpose for which it was originally taken, and (ii) as to the powers of Government Departments to retain requisitioned property until the legal termination of the war, seeing that under the Defence of the Realm Regulations possession can only be taken for the purpose of securing the public safety or the Defence of the Realm, and it might be said that occupation of the property is no longer required for these purposes.Treasury Counsel (Mr. Austen-Cartmell) is of opinion that the powers of the Crown in these respects are open to grave doubt, and that, particularly as regards (ii), the Crown is therefore in a serious position. Sir Frederick Liddell, the Parliamentary Counsel, on the other hand thinks this sub-paragraph one to which it would be difficult to ask&apos; Parliament to assent and he very much doubts its necessity. A decision is required as to whether this sub-paragraph should be included. The most controversial part of the clause is in the last two lines, but even if these were omitted the clause would still have some value.Clause 3 (2).6. This provision is intended to meet cases where buildings for war purposes have been erected on land held by a Government Department under a pre-war lease. In such cases Clause 3 (2). if enacted, would give power to purchase for re-sale, but there would still be no alternative power to remove the buildings. In some cases the land belongs to a local authority and cannot, therefore, be purchased, so that in the absence of a power of removal the buildings will pass automatically to the landlord.7. The remaining clauses of the present draft of the Bill are, with the exception of a few minor (mainly drafting) details, identical with those already approved by the Home Affairs Committee.8. I shall be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for the immediate introduction of the Bill with the inclusion of Clause 3 (1) (a), (6) and (e) and (2), and with the omission from 3 (1) (a) recommended above, and a decision with regard to the inclusion of (1).(^)-Peel.The War Office,6th July, 1920.

Royal Courts of Justice,. Thursday, 1st July, 1920.IN THE COURT OF THE RAILWAY AND CANAL COMMISSION.In re DEFENCE OF THE REALM (ACQUISITION OFLAND) ACT, 1916.MINISTER   OF   MUNITIONS MACKRILL.Before Mr. Justice Lush and Mr. Macnamara.(From the Shorthand Notes of Cherer &amp; Co., 8, New Court, Carey Street,W.C.2).judgment.Mr. Justice LUSH: This case raises a question of considerable importance which comes before us for the first time as to the conditions under which the Crown after taking temporary possession of the land of a private owner and erecting buildings on it for purposes connected with the War is entitled to acquire the property by compulsory purchase.
The facts are these.  The Minister of Munitions took possession, for the purpose of manufacturing munitions of War, of some premises at Hammersmith which belonged to the respondent, who is a builder, ^and which he had been in the habit of using for storing his building materials.  Buildings of a permanent nature were erected upon the land at a cost of  2,500.  A fire occurred there a year or two ago and the buildings were seriously damaged.  Their value as they stand is, it is agreed, about  500.    The Minister of Munitions asks for our consent to the acquisition by him of the land and buildings under the circumstances I am about to mention. Under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, the Crown is entitled, to retain possession of the&apos; premises for two years from the termination of the War or for &quot; such further period &quot; not exceeding three years as the Commission&quot; that is this Court  &quot;may consider necessary or expedient in the national interest&quot;. That is Section 1 sub-section 1. This power is made subject to the Respondent not having agreed otherwise with the Crown when possession was taken (Section 13, sub-section 3).   But the land cannot be acquired against the will of the owner unless the purposes for which it is required are within the purposes for which land can be acquired under the Defence Acts, 1842 to 1873, and the Military Lands Acts, 1892 to 1903, or the Naval Works Act, 1895, without the consent of this Court (Section 13, sub-section 5, and Section 12, sub-section 4). The purposes for which land can be acquired under these earlier Acts are certain military or naval purposes, the Crown being authorised to acquire land in order to use it for purposes of defence. This power&apos; of compulsory purchase is also subject to no agreement to the contrary having been made with the owner (Section 13, sub-section 4). The Respondent, the owner of these premises, was unwilling to part with the property, and the purposes for which the acquisition of it was required is not within the above mentioned Acts. The Minister of Munitions has accordingly applied to the Court for consent to the compulsory purchase of it.   The purpose for which the acquisition of the land is required is this. The Minister of Munitions has entered into a contract with a Distillery Company to sell the land with the buildings upon it to them at a price which is represented by the cost to the Minister of Munitions of obtaining it from the Respondent, that is the sum to be fixed by an Arbitrator adding interest and legal expenses and the value of the buildings.  The Minister of Munitions does not there-fore really require the land at all.  He would not use it; he would not be able to use it; he only wants to take it from the Respondent in order to sell it to recoup to the Department part- of the moneys that have been expended in erecting the buildings and avoid the loss which the Crown say will necessarily have to be incurred in removing the buildings. Section 2, sub-sections 1 and 2, of the Act say this: &quot;Whilst any land of which possession has been so taken
&quot;is in the possession of an occupying department after the termina-&quot; tion of the present War, any building,&quot; and so on,&quot; may be removed &quot;without the consent of any person interested in the land by the &quot;occupying department,&quot; .and then there are certain words which -it is not necessary to read. That is sub-section 1. Then sub-section 2 says: &quot;Where any building or work has been removed under the &quot;powers conferred by this section the occupying department shall &quot; cause the land to be restored to the condition in which it was before &quot; the building or work was erected&quot;, and so on. Then there is a provision with regard to compensation. Sub-section 3 says: &quot;Where any such buildings or works have been erected or &quot;constructed upon any common, open space or allotment the build-&quot; ing or work shall be removed and the land restored as aforesaid&quot;, and certain exceptions which again it is not necessary for me to read. The value of the materials if these buildings are removed will not equal the cost of the removal. I deal with the case on the assurnp-tion that this loss will be incurred if our consent is withheld.Now the first question to consider in determining whether our consent ought or ought not to be given is this: by what principle ought we to be guided, in deciding the question. No reference is made to it in the section under which the application is made Sub-section 3 of section 13 which provides for the Minister of Muni-tions compulsorily acquiring under an Order of this Court the whole or part of a park or garden where possession has been taken of part for War purposes says that this Court may by Order authorise the compulsory acquisition of the whole or part if we are satisfied that it is of national importance that it should be acquired. The p-rin-ciple on which we should, act in considering whether to make an Order is stated in that section. What we have to consider on an application under that section is whether it is of national import-ance that the whole or part of the park should be acquired. We dealt with an application under that section in the recent case, of the Minister of Munitions v. Chamberlain 1918&apos;, 2 King&apos;s Bench, 758,. wbjere the Judgment of the Court of Appeal is reported. Again in. section 1, sub-section 1 which as I have said empowers the Crown to continue in possession for such longer period than two years, not exceeding three years as the Commission may consider neces-sary or expedient in the national interest, the principle on which we should act is stated; but. in a case like the present nto express reference is made to it. The matter, as far as express reference is concerned, is left at large. The Attorney General in one part of his argument contended that all we have to consider is whether the conditions precedent to the making of the application have been fulfilled, namely, whether the Minister of Munitions is lawfully in possession and whether buildings of a permanent nature have been erected on the land. He said if we are satisfied of these facts we must exercise our discretion in favour of the Crown. I entirely
disagree with this contention. The statute in speaking of&quot; consent&quot; means what it clearly I think says/that we must not only be satis -lied that the application was properly made, that is that the conditions precedent have been fulfilled, but thiat it is under the circumstances- a proper one to which to accede, whatever the test. may be by which the propriety of it is to be judged. The Court is intended to protect the subject against any undue exercise of the power of the Crown to deprive him permanently of his property, and if we think in our discretion acting, of course, judicially that the circumstances are such that the power ought not to be exer-cised, I feel no doubt that it is our duty to prevent its being exercised by withholding our consent. It was further contended that at all events we ought to consent to the compulsory acquisition of the land if thereby a substantial loss to the State will be averted. It is in the national interest, it is said, or of national importance, that this object should be secured and no restriction being placed in the Act on the purposes for which the land is required we ought to sanction the purchase. The owner it is said, will be properly compensated by the payment of the sum to be fixed by the Arbitrator. The same argument would seem to apply if a substantial profit could be made by the compulsory purchase and re-sale of the land. This is a large claim and it raises a large question. Land includes mines and minerals; that is section 3 sub-section 3. If any Government department is in possession of any land or if any buildings have for war purposes been erected even partly at the expense of the State, the Crown may, according to thei argument, compulsorily acquire the land with the consent of this Court and we ought to consent if the Crown can avoid pecuniary loss or make a pecuniary profit by the purchase. I do not see why, if this argument is right, the Crown cannot purchase additional land from an adjoining owner and why he should not under section 13 (-1) acquire the whole of the &quot; park&quot; if buildings for the Minister of Munitions of War have been erected on part of it and so increase the profit that would be made. It is of national importance, it is said, that loss should be avoided or a&apos; profit made. If so, these/ sections, that is section 3 (2) and section 13 (lb) which equally with section 13 (5) say nothing about the user of the land would apply, and the Court ought to give its consent to the further compulsory acquisition. I cannot agree with this contention. We must, in my opinion, before deciding whether to give or withhold our consent to the compulsory acquisition of land consider whether the Government department really require it, need to have it and use it for national purposes or, at all events, see whether they can make any advantageous use of it. If they prove that they need it, or can so use it, it was, I think, intended that we should sanction their acquiring it, if in the exercise of our discretion we think that under all the circumstances it is right to do so. Just as in the case of an application for leave to continue in &apos;   possession for more than two years, but it was not, in my opinion,a)
ever contemplated by the Act that the compulsory powers should be exercised where the Crown do not really want tho land at all, and where they only take it in order to sell it to some other person or to carry into effect a contract to sell it which has already been entered into. Under the Defence Act of 1842, and the other group of Acts referred to in section 13 (5) which so far as the acquisition of land is concerned are in pari materia with this Act, the power of compulsory purchase was only given where the land itself was wanted for national defence, and throughout the Act of 1916 it is, I think, assumed that the same principle applies. Section 3 gives power to acquire any adjoining land or easement if it appears to the Commission to be required for the proper enjoyment of the land so acquired. Section 4 deals with the uses to which the Crown can put the&apos; land It says: &quot;Any land which, or an interest in which, &quot; has been acquired under this Act may be used by any Government &quot; department for the purpose for which it was used during the War &quot;&apos;or for any other purpose for which it could have been used had &quot;the land been acquired under the Defence Acts&quot;, and so on, &quot; notwithstanding that such user could, but for this Act have been &quot; restrained as being in contravention of any covenant&quot;, and so on. Section 5 says this:&quot; Where any land or any interest therein has by &quot;virtue of this Act been acquired by any Government department, &quot;the department may at any time thereafter sell, lease, or other -&quot; wise dispose of the land or interest&quot;. This seems to me to contem-plate a subsequent sale after the Department has bought and used the land. It provides that if it is afterwards found unnecessary to keep the land it. may be sold, but it assumes, I think, that when acquired it was intended to use it, and again power is given to the Court to bold a local inquiry by section 8, sub-section 2 with a view, of course, to assisting us in our consideration of the utility for national purposes of the lands which it is proposed to acquire. Moreover, I do not think that if we were to sanction this purchase, the Crown could be said to be acquiring the land at all, in any real sense. The conveyance would naturally be taken direct to the Distillery Company. That Company would be the equitable owners and the Company would, I think, be really acquiring the land and not the Crown. I find it difficult to see why the legislature should have enacted in section 5 (3) that if buildings of a permanent nature are erected the Minister of Munitions need not offer the land in the first instance to the owner if this kind of transaction&apos; was contem-plated. One would have thought that the owner would have been the first person to whom the land with the buildings on it should be offered if the Crown only bought it. in order to resell. The reason why section 13 (5) was framed as it is, is, in my opinion, that under the development of modern warfare land can be put to many uses which are not, strictly speaking, or may not be military purposes at&apos; all; purposes of research and experiment, for example, and it was intended, I think, that the Court should consider each case on its
merits if the  proposed purchase was not strictly a military or naval purpose, and decide&apos; whether, under all the circumstances, the Order ought to be made. The other view for which the Crown contend would enable a Department to compulsorily deprive an owner of land merely in order to make a profit out of it at his expense. The power to compulsory purchase land, take it from the owner against his will at a price to be fixed by the Arbitrator has hitherto been confined to cases where the land will be put to some use from which the community can derive some benefit. If the Statute has given to the Crown the right which is claimed in clear terms, we, of course, have nothing to do but to enforce it. But the power is certainly not given in clear terms. In my opinion, it is not given at all. For these reasons, I think, apart from the special circum-stances of this case, that we ought to withhold our consent.But I do not wish to confine my Judgment to the general ground. On the special facts of this case, I am of opinion that even if the purpose is a legitimate and proper one, we still ought to with-hold our consent. On an application under this section we must, I think, consider not only whether the proposed order is expedient from the public point of view, but whether it would work a hardship and injustice on the owner. It is not enough to say that he would obtain compensation. He ought not to be compulsorily deprived of his property for such a purpose as the Crown have in view in this case unless it is just and right to compel him to part with it. The respondent will be seriously hampered in his business if he is deprived of these premises. It is the only place he can get in which to store his building materials, and it is conveniently situate near to his business premises. He has had to discharge some of his men through being deprived of the possession of it. The Minister of Munitions, though, I agree, that he is not bound to do so, has not given him the offer of re-purchasing, and has contracted to sell them to another firm. The Minister of Munitions has not proved that the respondent will not pay the same price. He has not proved that the Distillery Company are paying an advantageous price to the Minister of Munitions. In fact, the Respondent stated, and I have no doubt truthfully, especially considering the terms of the contract with the Distillery Company, that he is prepared to enter into a contract on the same terms. He can adapt and use the buildings in his business, and will be glad to have them. The Minister of Munitions, if this is done, will sutler no loss at all. If we give our consent to the applica-tion, we shall, as I have said, be really consenting to the Distillery Company acquiring the premises. I do not think that we ought to do that, even assuming that the proposition is a proper and legiti-inate one within the meaning of the Act, and therefore in any view of the matter, I am of opinion that we must refuse our consent to the application.With regard to the costs we have power under this Act to deal with them, and, in my opinion, the respondent must have his costs.
Mr. MACNAMARA: This is an application under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916- statute prepared for the purpose of making provision as to the possession and acquisition of land which was occupied and used for the defence of the Realm in connection with the War. Section 3 sub-section 1 of the Act, provides that: &quot;-Subject to the provisions of this Act it shall be &quot; lawful to acquire by agreement or compulsorily on behalf of His &quot; Majesty (a) any land in the possession of the occupying department &quot;or any interest in such land; (3) any land on over or under which&quot;any buildings.....have for purposes connected with the&quot;present War, been erected, constructed, or made wholly or partly at &quot;the expense of the State, or any interest in such land&quot;.One of the provisions of the Act to which this wide enactment is subject, is to be found in Section 13 sub-section 5 which enacts that &quot; Nothing in this Act shall authorise the compulsory acquisition of &quot; land without the consent of the Commission where the purposes for &quot; which it is to be acquired are purposes other than those for which &quot; land can be acquired under the Defence Acts 1842 to 1873, or the &quot; Military Lands Acts 1892 to 1903&quot;.In 1916 the Minister of Munitions under the powers conferred upon him by the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act 1914 took compulsory possession of a piece of land, the property of the Respon-dent situate in Chancellors Road in the Parish of Hammersmith for the purpose of erecting a factory fpr the manufacture of acetone. The factory was completed and the land is still in the occupation of the Ministry of Munitions.The Minister of Munitions now applies to this Court for an Order authorising the compulsory acquisition of the land of the Respondent. The grounds on which the application is based are stated as follows: &quot;Public funds to the extent of approximately &quot;  2,500 have been expended in the erection of the said factory. If &quot; the said parcel of land is not purchased by the Applicant the said &quot; factory must be removed in which case a building of considerable &quot; utility for industrial purposes will be demolished and only a very &quot; small fraction of its value will be recovered and in addition the &quot; said parcel of land will have to be reinstated or compensation will &quot;have to be paid in lieu of reinstatement which will constitute a &quot; further charge on public, jjmds. On the other hand if the consent &quot; of this Honourable Court is obtained and the said parcel of land is &quot; purchased the said land together with the said factory can be sold &quot;in pursuant of an Agreement dated the 30th day of October, 1919, &quot;made between the Applicant and the Hammersmith Distillery &quot; Company, Limited, on terms which will enable public funds to be &quot; recouped a considerable portion of the expenditure which has been &quot; incurred.&quot; In answer to this the Respondent in his pleading states that&quot; The said land was and is of great importance to the Respondent
&quot;in his business as builder and decorator as a store yard for his &quot;materials and as a yard for constructional and other works and &quot; was so used by him (with the exception of a part which he sublet &quot;at 2/- a week) from 1896 till the date when the Applicant took &quot;possession. It is close to his office and he has been unable to find &quot; any other land within any reasonable distance at all suitable for his &quot; purpose and during the possession of the land by the Applicant he&apos; &quot; has been compelled to use temporarily a yard considerably smaller &quot;paying  13 a year for a yard which is almost useless for his &quot;purpose. As a result he is and will be hampered in his business &quot; particularly in view of the revival of the building trade and there &quot; is no available land which will compensate him for the loss of the &quot; land now in question and he will submit that this is not a case in &quot; which consent to the compulsory acquisition of the said land should &quot;be given by the Honourable Court&quot;.The learned Attorney General submitted that all the Court had to do was to see that conditions precedent were fulfilled that the Ministry was in possession of the land and had erected permanent buildings on it and the Court being satisfied of that should exer-cise its discretion in favour of the Crown. I disagree with this contention for the reasons stated in my Lord&apos;s Judgment.I express no opinion on the question for what purpose must the Crown apply to acquire the land because in this case on the conclu-sion I have arrived at, it can be decided without doing so.The Respondent, the owner of the land, is not entitled to pre-emption under Section 5, Sub-section (3), of the Act, but he stated in the witness box that he was willing to pay  500 for the building which is the admitted value. That is also the price that the Distillery Company are to pay the Minister of Munitions if the agreement between them is carried out.The Court must consider whether it is a case in which the loss to the Respondent of being deprived of the land can be adequately provided for under the compensation sections of the Statute. The Respondent does not desire compensation but the return of his land Which he was willing should be occupied during the period of the war for the purpose of the war. The land which he temporarily rented.during the war is no longer available.The Respondent says that the land, the subject of the applica-tion, is essential to his business and that he cannot get any other suitable land. No evidence was given on behalf of the Applicant contradicting this. What Lord Terrington said in his Judgment in the case of The Minister of Munitions v. Tankerville Chamberlain (the first case in this Court under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916) I desire to quote and adopt. He said, &quot;I agree &quot;in the view that in considering these applications, and in exercising
&quot; the wide discretion entrusted to them by the Legislature, the Court &quot;must have regard to all the facts and circumstances of each &quot; particular case, and whilst guarding the interests of the State where &quot;considerable sums of money have been expended, must be careful &quot; to see that the State does not use the power given to them by the . &quot;Statute in a way which would work undue hardship to the &quot;individual whose property is expropriated&quot;,I am of opinion that the Court in the exercise of its judicial discretion should not give its consent to this application on the ground that it would work undue hardship to the Respondeni^-a hardship which compensation would not do away with.The application for consent must be dismissed with costs.
