563(P 5132)rom Viceroy, 2Slk June 1920.(Repeated to Teheran.) (Received 30th, 3.15 p.m.)792 S.   Your telegram dated 21st May last, No. 3712 P.Strategic. In view of the military advantages of crossing the waterless region between Dnzdap and Neh by rail instead of by animal transport, the extension.,of. the railway to Neh and possibly even to Shusp would be an important strategic asset. Such an extension would greatly increase our initiative should any operation be necessary in East Persia in the future. We strongly oppose any further extension beyond Shusp, as unduly reducing gaps between Indian and Russian railway systems. With rail (? head) at Shusp tho distance to Khuskh, the nearest Russian terminus, will be some 280 miles. Any exteusion beyond Shusp would create a railway exposed to Afghan attacks throughout its length. The decision that our troops are shortly to be withdrawn from lending assistance only partially affects general strategic argument. ,We have already shown in our Army Departments telegram No. 54, 1st May, that had this withdrawal not been sanctioned, construction of Duzdap^ Neh extension would have been essential from a military point of view. ,v(2) Commercial. It is owing to the hot desert stretching bet wean Duzdap &quot;and Neh that the Nushld extension of railway fails to open up East Persia to British trade. We do not contemplate extension to Neh will pay its way as a commercial -proposition, but we are of opinion it is only by such an extension that we can,hope at present favourable moment to consolidate, and subsequently to retain, British commercial predominance in North-East Persia. &quot; . .(3) Political.   Extension would tend to give moral support through trade to the pro-British element in East Persia, and we see in healthy trade the most potent: antidote to Bolshevism.   Extension would also be extricate trade from the double threats of; Sarhacl Rafiq and of Afghans.   We believe that it would be welcomed by all classes in East Persia.(4) We do not approve of Scott&apos;s idea(s) of a light railway. Besides being of little military use in time of need, it would cost more to run than a broad gauge&apos; extension owing to the need of special engines and rolling stock, and heavy establishment charges. . - * &apos;,(5) In laying above facts before His Majesty&apos;s Government the Government of India wish to add that they do not consider that they would be justified on commercial grounds in applying capital funds at their disposal for railway purposes to the construction of an extension from Duzdap./
