A(lip)twit?1 ^KVO ,A,dV.2 .0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS, ^ITAITOC, M^S^;S,,ggmMgWPOSITION OP CONTROLLED CANALS.MfttORAHDUM POR THE CABINET BY THECF TRANSPORT.4225   \:1It is necessary for me to draw attention to the position of the Controlled Canals.The Railway owned Canals fall within the scope of the Railway Agreements and are thus guaranteed their 1913 net receipts for the period of controls.The more important Canals, numbering 32 in all, not owned by a Railway Company, were taken * under control in 1917 or later by the Board of Trade under Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Regulations 9 H, which gave the Board power to Issue directions as to user and management.    This regulation makes no reference to any question of financial compensation.The tonnage carried was diminishing end the personnel was being rapidly depleted?  but it was necessary to secure their continued operation during the emergency period.    Agreements were, therefore, negotiated with the individual Companies on a basis similar to that of the Railway Agreements, including a guarantee of the net receipts of a basic year, which in general represents 12 months immediately prior to the War.    The guarantee extends to all aspects of the Companies8 Undertakings, including their carrying trade.Similar agreements were also entered into with private carriers in a few cases;   but these have now been determined, as such carriers are not/subject
subject to any statutory maxima In respect of the rates they may charge*There are a considerable number of small canals and navigations,, of no national import-anoe though no doubt of local utility, irhich were not taken under control.    fto immediate question arises in regard to thenu2* As regards the Controlled Canals thesituation it diffioullt    The financial guarantee empires in any case with the Emergency Powers in connection with which it was given, arid X think that the Ordtr made under Defence of the Realm Regulation!, should be revoked m from the Slit August mx%*    The financial position of the Undertakings is, however, far more serious than it was in 1917.    The Com-pensaticm payments which amounted to  433,000 for the nine months March to December 19X7 and to  829,000  0* the $hole year 19X8, reached over  1,324,000 in financial year 1910/80*rlhe operating expenses of the Canals have risen enormously as a result of inoreased cost of material and labour concessions while their traitie fom fallen off*5* It is estimated that by raiging Canaltolls and Charges to a competitive level with the Hallway rates as increased under the January revision, an additional revenue of roughly  600,000 on the basis of the 1918 traffic could be obtained and the additions^ to Hallway rates now under consideration would enable/this
this  sum to be materially Increased.4* It must, however, be borne in mind that even when steps have been taken to raise Canal tolls and charges to the highest point consistent with maintenance of their traffic, it may not be practicable to leave all the Controlled Canals to their own resources.    Though control was assumed solely on grounds of emergency and though there is no express obligation upon the State to continue to subsidise Canals once the emergency period is over, 1 am of opinion that until such time as the Government is able to formulate its future policy In regard to Canals as a whole, it would not bo right to run any risk of what may be important links in the chain of inland oommuni-cation by water becoming derelicts5. Apart from special legislation, the onlyprocedure under which Canal tolls and charges can be raised is that prescribed by the Ministry of Transport Act*&apos; My reoommendatlons accordingly are s-(1)    That X should be authorised to takepossession of any controlled canal that may apply to be taken into possession under the Ministry of Transport Act, with a view to immediate reference to the Rates Advisory Committee and a subsequent direction to increase tolls and charges to such an  extent as may be practicable in existing circumstancea*/(2) That
That I should give notice to tho Controlled Canals through the Canal Control Committee, that the present control and the financial guarantee given in connection therewith will cease on the 31st August nextoThai in taking possession for the purpose of directing an increase in rates 1 should intimate In each case that the Government neither continue? the existing guarantee nor assume any new financial obligation in its pl&amp;ee*    It may, however, be necessary to take into account on its merits what the position of each Undertaking will be on the termination of the present control in the light of its increased charging powers *X ought to point out that while no direct financial obligation is involved in taking possession, if i% became necessary to give directions not con-curred in by the Canal Undertakings, claims for compensation might arise, but, as my present intention is not to Issue directions except for the purpose of directing increases in tolls and charges, this is&amp;a ainlikely contingency./ An early
An early decision of the Cabinet is requested as the matter has been unavoidably delayed and the Canal Companies desire to know where they stand.ERIC GEDDES.9th July. 1920,
