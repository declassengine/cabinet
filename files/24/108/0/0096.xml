[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government] -Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1920.SECRET. C.P.-1593.HOUSING COMMITTEE.Report by the Chairman of the Committee.1. TERMS OF REFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE.THE Committee were appointed by a Cabinet Minute (Cabinet 36 (20), Conclusion 2, dated the 16th June, 1920), which reads as follows : It was agreed &quot;(a.) That the whole situation should be examined at once, from the point of view both of hastening the erection of houses and of the financial burdens on the State, by a Committee of the following Ministers : &quot;The President of the Board of Trade (in the Chair).&quot; The Minister of Health.&quot; The Minister of Labour.&quot; The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.&quot; The. Secretary for Scotland.&quot; The First Commissioner of Works.&quot; Sir L. Worthington-Evans.&quot; The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.&quot; Mr. T. Jones (Secretary).&quot; The Ministers should consider the desirability of consulting some prominent builders and look into the question of building work by Government Departments, including the provision of certain building materials and administration of houses by the Minister of Munitions, which - would require to be transferred elsewhere on the termination of that Ministry, and the work undertaken by the Office of Works on behalf of the Camberwell Borough Council (Paper C.P.-1455). &quot; (b.) That after the forthcoming interview with M. Millerand and M. Marsal the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should, if possible, associate themselves with the Committee.&quot;The Committee had before them the following papers, which had been submitted to the Cabinet at the meeting when the above decisions were taken: A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-1330).A Memorandum by Sir L. Worthington-Evans (Paper C.P.-1348).A Memorandum by the Minister of Health (Paper C.P.-1396).A Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland (Paper C.P.-1437).A Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works (Paper C.P.-1455).A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-1466).In addition to the above papers various memoranda were prepared by the Departments concerned at the request of the Committee; these contain more detailed information than it was possible to put before the Cabinet.As instructed by the Cabinet, the Committee considered the desirability of consulting some prominent builders, and they agreed that the wishes of the Cabinet could best be carried out by means of informal consultation between the Chairman of the Committee and such representatives of the building trade as he might think necessary. They felt that, the taking of evidence before the whole Committee would occupy more time than could properly be spared, and there was a good deal of evidence in the memoranda before the Committee which had been obtained by previous cabinet.
consultation with the employers and operatives in the trade. In the result, the only questions on which the Chairman considered that such help was required at this stage were considerations affecting the employers, and he has.seen Mr. Easton and Mr. White, the Employers&apos;Secretary of the National Board of Conciliation for the Building Trades, from whom he derived much information. The other employers whom he desired to consult were not available at the time.As regards the second part of section (a) of their terms of reference, the Committee understand that application&apos; has been made to the Treasury that the Building Materials Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions, which is at present being administered by the Ministry ot: Health, should be transferred permanently to the latter Department. The completion of housing schemes of the Ministry of Munitions and the administration of housing schemes already completed by that Department are being carried out by the Office of Works.2. GENERAL SITUATION.Labour &quot;Supply.The general situation in regard to housing is set forth quite clearly in the memoranda referred to above. The trade is abnormally short of labour owing to the fact that it was unprotected during the war, and the Unions are averse to the rapid recruitment of labour, as they desire to ensure steady and regular employment for as long a period as possible. They also appreciate the strong bargaining position they hold when the demand for their labour is so greatly in excess of the supply. The following figures for England and Wales illustrate the decline in the number of building operatives since 1901: .&quot; to	Census Returns.

The latter are obtained from the returns of the numbers of unemployment insurance, books current in England and Wales in July 1914 and in January 1920 for men similarly engaged. There has been some increase&quot; in the numbers engaged in each trade since the latter date. The decline in the numbers since 1914 is in itself sufficiently serious, in view of the heavy requirements of the present time.   The corresponding figures for Scotland are : 	Census Returns.

The amount of unemployment in the bricklayers&apos; trade is practically negligible, say 0&apos;22 per cent.; there is therefore an extremely big demand for this class of labour for repair work and industrial and various foims of building other than housing.
The shortage of skilled labour is already serious, although only a relatively small proportion of the (33,094 houses for which contracts have been signed have been put in hand. On the 1st JuDe some 21,000 houses were in course of construction by local authorities and public utility societies ; for these schemes only 5,290 bricklayers had been secured, and this number was actually short by 4,804 of the number required for efficiently carrying on the work. .   &apos;The Building Resettlement Committee of the -Joint Industrial Council, who have given much consideration to this question and discussed it on numerous occasions with representatives of the Ministry of Health, came to the conclusion that a total of about 127,000 skilled men will be required for a programme of 200,000 houses in a year. Of.;this total about 48,600 would need to be bricklayers, which it will be observed, is more than 90 per cent, of the total number of bricklayers in the countrf.Some of the other skilled trades such as the slaters and plasterers show similar deficiencies.It is clear, therefore, that the total amount of skilled labour in the building trade is inadequate to the demands which are at present being made upon it. It is not a question of the mobility of labour, for the same difficulty is apparent in all parts of the country. There is an actual and proportionately large shortage on the jobs which have been commenced. The skilled labour necessary for the erection of the 63,000 houses for which contracts have already been signed in England and Wales cannot in present conditions be forthcoming. Still less is the labour supply capable of meeting the requirements of the programme which the housing situation demands.In addition to the shortage of labour, the output of the labour actually employed is low a fact which is attributable both to the reduction of working hours and to psychological causes. The effect is that bricklayers are laying about 400 bricks a day, as against a reasonable output of 700.It is evident, therefore, that unless there is a greatly increased output of work, or an advance in other forms of construction, the full number of 48,600 bricklayers will be required.Moreover, many builders prefer to undertake repairing work and commercial building, both of which are simpler and more profitable than house-building.Cost of Building.The result both of the shortage of labour and the competition of other forms of building and of industry generally for the labour available is that rates of wages are progressively increasing. This increase adds to the cost of house-building and to the burden to be borne by the Exchequer, since local authorities have been promised that their liabilities will be limited to the. produce of a penny rate.The following figures illustrate the recent increase in the cost of building due to rises in price of labour and material: England.Date. 1	Average Amount of Tender per House.

The. Chancellor of the Exchequer has estimated (see CP. 1330j that, if wages continue to rise at the present rate, the annual subsidy to be paid by the Exchequer as a result of the building of 300,000 houses in England and 60,000 houses in Scotland before August 1922, will be 25,000,0001., and even&apos;then there will possibly be as many as f)00,000 houses to be built in England and 70,000 houses in Scotland.3. PROPOSED INTERVIEW WITH EMPLOYERS&apos; ASSOCIATIONS AND THE BUILDING TRADE UNIONS.Suggested National Agreement with Trade Unions.The Committee feel that the housing problem can only be solved by dealing comprehensively with the question of labour. This is the crux of the problem. The deficiency of labour and the low output and increase of cost seem likely to deprive the country of the houses it needs. The Committee think that the policy which was adopted during the war with such good results, of making a national agreement with labour for an increase of output, should be tried in the present case. They therefore suggest that the Prime Minister should invite representatives of the Employers&apos; Associations and Trade Unions in the building trade, at first separately and then together, to meet him, and should urge the latter to enter into an agreement similar to the Treasury Agreement of the 19th March, 1915, with the object cf meeting the deficiencies in labour and increasing output.The proposals which should be put before the Employers&apos; Associations and Trade Unions should, in the opinion of the Committee, be on the lines described below. It is not suggested that these proposals should be regarded as hard and fast conditions, and in the course of negotiation they will no doubt have to be modified. They provide, however, a basis of bargaining, including as they do, on the one hand, concessions which the Trade Unions are extremely anxious to obtain, and, on the other hand, proposals which will go far to secure the additional output of labour required.It is thought that labour will be disposed to discuss a bargain of the nature proposed as they have already expressed a desire to co-operate in the solution of housing difficulties, and have indicated their willingness to make some concessions in return for guarantees which will secure them against unemployment. They have, for instance, offered to co-operate with the Ministry of Health to ensure that there shall be no stoppage of building in connection with disputes on housing schemes, and to circularise their members and invite them to enlist for housing work. They have -also, subject to safeguarding conditions against unemployment, offered to use their organisation for the purpose of meeting actual deficiencies of labour upon any schemes as and when they arise.A. Proposals for Increasing the Supply of Labour.(i.) Grading up of Unskilled Men.A considerable number of building labourers are semi-skilled workers or &quot; handy men,&quot; and with a very short period of training upon the actual work of housing these men could acquire a sufficient knowledge of such trades as bricklayer, slater, tiler and plasterer to enable them to carry out work with the rate and quality of output upon housing of an average operative.These men should be classed as &quot;learners &quot; for a period of six months, working throughout upon the jobs, and would, of course, carry out their training side by side with the skilled operative. They should be paid the labourers&apos; rate for the first three&apos; months, an intermediate rate for the second three months, and after that period, provided that they had been able to acquire the necessary skill in the trade, they would be granted*the tradesmen&apos;s rates and should receive the full ticket of the Craft Union concerned. Such learners could be placed upon works to the number of one to four skilled operatives.(ii.) Apprentices.The number of apprentices indentured to building trade employers in the pre-war period was originally considered sufficient to maintain a satisfactory supply of operatives ; the number apprenticed, however, had begun to fall seriously in 1911., Immediately
preceding the outbreak of war, however, the building trade was in an unhealthy and unsatisfactory condition. There had been a serious slump in building extending for a long period, and a sharp contest between the masters and the men had resulted in a lock-out which lasted for a considerable time.Owing to these circumstances, men were apprenticing their sons to other callings rather than the building trade, and the normal growth of the trade was checked. During most of the war period the building trade was not regarded as an essential industry, and not only was there a constant flow from the building trade to other and protected trades, but there was complete cessation of apprenticeship, and there is no evidence that this has been resumed. It is, however, essential for the satisfactory maintenance of the standard of building in this country that the flow of apprentices to the trade shall be resumed at the earliest possible moment, and the trade can fairly be asked to agree that not only shall youths be accepted as apprentices, but that older men who may have some knowledge of the industry shall be admitted as a type of apprentice to serve a somewhat shorter term than that which was customary in the case of youths indentured in the pre-war period.It should be agreed that the latter class of men admitted to the trade in this way might serve an apprenticeship of two years and be paid at the labourers&apos; rate for one year and an intermediate rate between the labourer and tradesman during the second year of their apprenticeship. The youth apprentice would of course come in under the customary trade conditions.&quot; &apos; . *(iii.) Training of New Men.In the present unsatisfactory condition of the supply of labour for building purposes, it is unquestionably fair to arrange for the introduction to the trade of ex-Service men between the ages of, say, 22 to 26 after a period of training. A considerable number of partially disabled men are at present undergoing a course of training in the various crafts of the building industry, but as this supply must shortly be exhausted the consent of the trade must be obtained to the inclusion of all tit ex-Service men who would be prepared to undergo the course of training for service in the building industry.At the present time, the trainees undergo a ^course in an instructional factory of from twenty-six to thirty-nine weeks, according to the trade. They are then drafted as improvers into the industry for a further period of from thirty-nine weeks to two and a-quarter years. An attempt should be made wherever practicable to lower the instructional period of training, and it should certainly be possible in the case of all trades except carpenter, joiner and plumber, where special training is required, for the trainees to be drafted on to the housing sites after a short preliminary training, and their final course of instruction could be completed on the actual erection of houses, provided that special arrangements were made for their supervision and further training.Some objection might be raised to the introduction of such labour on contract work, inasmuch as it might be argued either that the output would be prejudiced by the introduction of partially-skilled labour or that the contractor would be swelling his profits by the use of cheap labour. Neither of these objections, however, appear to be insuperable in practice if the Trade Unions would co-operate, and, in view of the special need for additional workers in the building industry, steps must be taken to secure the acceptance of this proposal.As regards schemes on which the labour is controlled by direct administration without the introduction of a contractor, the proposal can be adopted without any difficulty provided a measure of Trade Union co-operation [can be obtained and the State can urge in support of its action that, on the one hand, houses would be produced for the local authorities, and, on the other hand, the scheme would deal constructivelv with the question of unemployment among ex-Service men, which in some instances is serious, and is everywhere becoming increasingly pressing.Trainees would be paid the present training allowances paid ,to disabled men under the scheme of the Ministry of Labour, and instructors would be paid the salaries customary in Ministry of Labour Training Centres, which are about 20 per cent, above district rates.It must be emphasised, however, that the effect of the introduction of trainees would only be felt at au early date in such trades as bricklayer, slater and plasterer. In the case of carpenters and joiners the trainees would require a longer period of training, which would certainly be not less than nine months. At the same time, these men could be utilised for some of the rough carpentry and for manufacture of joinery
. ,6 !,oion the housing schemes during the latter period of their training, and this would in itself, to a certain extent, accelerate output.At the present time the shortage of carpenters, joiners and plumbers has not been found to be so acute as the shortage of bricklayers. It will, however, be felt in the near future,, and it takes longer to meet, and in order partly to meet the shortage and to bridge the period between the substantial introduction of additional skilled workers to the trade, special attention should be directed to the possibility of substituting other material for timber work on housing schemes.The Unions will also probably raise the point as to the number of learners, apprentices and trainees to be introduced on any one work in relation to the skilled workers actually employed on the scheme. The proposal is that the proportion should be one semi-skilled man (learner, or apprentice, or trainee) to two skilled men, although, in many cases, it might not be possible to reach such a high proportion on such small work as is found in the erection of cottages.(iv.) Unemployment Insurance.It must be remembered, however, that the proposals put forward in this memo-randum can only be adopted with the full consent of the Graft Unions of the trade, and it is unlikely that this consent will be obtained without considerable difficulty. It is the fear of future unemployment which renders labour ill-inclined to grant any concessions, but it should not be difficult to show that with the great demand for building labour svhich will continue for many years to come, this fear is groundless. In any case it can be pointed out that the operatives will be insured against unemployment under the Government scheme and that under the new Act [they can make . supplementary provision from Trade Union funds.The adoption of the proposals outlined in this memorandum will not result in the supply of such a number of skilled operatives as to be fully adequate to the needs of the National Housing Scheme, but the numbers obtained will be sufficient to secure a fairly satisfactory rate of progress, and as far as can be seen at present no other sources of supply are available.x B. Proposals for Increasing Output.In addition to making the above recommendations for increasing the supply of . labour, the Committee have considered what steps should be taken to increase the output&apos; of labour already employed in building. . They recommend that the following offer should be made to the Building Trade Unions : -(i.) Guaranteed Week.A concession which would be greatly appreciated by the building trade would be what is known as a &quot; guaranteed week.&quot; At present, men are not entitled to payment for time lost through bad weather, nor through lack of materials or other causes over which the men have no control. It is considered that in order to obtain a guarantee of wages for all periods at which the man presents himself for work the trade might be willing to go very far towards meeting the wishes of the Government. The best method of introducing the guaranteed week would be by agreement in the trade. If representatives of the Government attempt -to formulate detailed proposals they can only do so with a limited knowledge of the trade, and there are considerations, financial, technical, and to some extent actuarial, which only those engaged in the trade can properly assess. The Committee recommend, however, that the following main principles should be laid down in the Governments offer to grant the building trade engaged on building houses a guaranteed week : fa.) The offer of a guaranteed week to the building trade engaged in housing, means that the men shall not lose/their entire wages through loss of time caused by bad weather, but that they shall be paid in accordance with the principles set out below.(b.) In return for the guaranteed week (as above defined) the building trade shall undertake to permit a 9 hours&apos; day and 50 hours&apos;week in the summer.; and a 7 hours&apos; day and ,&quot;i9 hours&apos; week in the winter, in the case of building operatives engaged in housing. (Note. The offer of a guaranteed week should apply only to housing and not to the building trade generally.)(c.) A guaranteed week shall consist of 35 hours in summer, and 20 hours in winter at full rates.   The rest of the time at half rates.
(d.) The guaranteed week should be granted on the condition that the men remain in attendance on the job throughout the week and that they only leave work when rung off by the proper authority, and return to work when rung on by the same authority.(e.) The Government cannot recognise overtime within the limit of 50 hours per week in summer. This attitude is justified by the shortness of winter hours. ,.(/.) The normal conditions of service should otherwise be applicable.(ii.) Stoppages and Strikes.- The Unions should be asked to undertake that there will be no strikes or stoppages in housing work. Matters of dispute should be dealt with by Conciliation Boards in the ordinary way and, as a last resort, by the Industrial Court; at the same time &quot; site&quot; stewards should act through their Unions.(iii.) Overtime.In making the offer of a guaranteed week to the Trade Unions, the Prime Minister should invite the Unions to allow their members to work overtime on housing (when overtime is required) at the rates current in the district.(iv.) Payment by Results.The Building Trade Unions, in common with other Trade Unions, take strong objection to piece-work. The Committee consider however, that the adoption of some scheme of piece-work is the only way to increase the output of houses, and they. recommend that the Prime Minister should urge on the building trade the adoption of a system of payment by results, which will permit the men to earn substantially higher wages than those yielded by ordinary rates. The Prime Minister might ask the Trade Unions themselves to make specific proposals to this end, and he should emphasise the fact that any such system will be subject to the following safeguards :-1. The men will be consulted in fixing the prices of a particular piece of work. 2. There will be no cutting of prices after they have been fixed. 3. Each man will have a guarantee of a minimum wage for an hour&apos;s work of ... a certain output..The Committee recommend that the offer of a guaranteed week referred to above should be made contingent on the acceptance of the conditions laid down in (ii), (iii) and (iv).  ,C. Competition of Contractors for Labour.The Committee have had under consideration the situation arising from the competition of contractors engaged on work other than housing for the labour employed in housing. Generally speaking, contractors engaged on factories and other buildings competing with housing are willing to pay far higher rates than the recognised district rates in order to obtain expedition in getting their work completed. Two examples may be given: (a). Contractors building a dye work at Grangemouth are at present paying 2d. more per hour than, the district rate; (6&apos; the owners of a factory at present being erected give each man a bonus at the end of the week in addition to the ordinary pay which they get from the contractor. The result is that men are diverted from house building, and housing schemes are gravely prejudiced. The Minister of Health considers that it is essential that additional powers should be given to prohibit the erection of buildings which are deemed to be of less public importance than the provision of dwelling accommodation, in cases where provision for such accommodation is likely to be hindered. Powers to do this are already -given by section 5 of the &quot;Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919,&quot; to local authorities in regard to buildings in their own area, but the competitive building may be in another area whose authority refuses to take action.The Committee recommend that a clause should be inserted in the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill giving the Minister of Health power to prohibit competitive building in any area where the local authority is failing to act, and also to make provision for grouping areas so that the authorities may act together.   They also
recommend that the Prime Minister should inform the representatives of the building trades that the competition of contractors engaged in housing work is prejudicing the housing scheme throughout the United Kingdom, and that unless those particularly concerned in it (i.e., the contractors and Trade Unions) are in a position to create an organisation which will prevent undue and unfair competition for labour engaged in housing schemes, it will be necessary for the Government to legislate in order to prevent the payment of wages in excess of the standard rate of wage in any district that may be concerned. This power was contained in the provisions of the Munitions of War Act, and while it would doubtless create some opposition if it were re-enacted, there does not seem to be any other feasible method of meeting the difficulty. &apos; If the building trade are set to find some remedy for themselves and fail, it may reconcile them to the necessary legislation being passed.4. DIRECT BUILDING BY THE OFFICE OF WORKS.It has been suggested that greater use should be made of the method of direct building by the Office of Works on behalf of local authorities in cases where such authorities are dilatory or supine. As the law stands at present, the Minister of Health has power to proceed with housing schemes after he has declared the local authority in default, but the Committee are informed that this involves great delay.The Committee consider that the suggestion to use the Office of Works for the carrying out of housing schemes on behalf of local authorities might well be adopted. They are informed that the additional staff required by the Office of Works will not be large, and will consist principally of subordinate temporary officers. It is confidently believed, that the saving on the cost of the houses would be much greater than the cost of the extra staff. The Housing Section of the Office of Works has been re-organised during the war to deal with bulk production, and is familiar with the task of undertaking work on a large scale.The Committee therefore recommend : (i.) That the Office of Works should be authorised to undertake direct building when requested to do so by the Minister of Health, and that the Chief Commissioner of Works should be instructed to make such additions as may be necessary to the staff of his department for this purpose.(ii.) That the Minister of Health should only use the services of the Office of Works in cases in which he is of opinion that it is necessary to do so in order that housing schemes may be carried out within a reasonable period, and then only after negotiation with the local authority and obtaining its acquiescence in this step.(iii.) That in the case of direct building schemes carried out by the Office of Works, there should not be outstanding at any one time advances in excess of 3,00(),()OOL, and that the Office of Works should commence building only in cases where the Minister of Health, after consultation with the Goschen Committee, is satisfied that the necessary money can be recovered from the local authorities.5. UTILISATION OF BUILDING SOCIETIES.The Committee consider that more use should be made of&apos; building societies. At present the credit of these societies is restricted owing to the fact that they have advanced money for the purchase of existing houses on a large scale and cannot finance the erection of new houses. The Committee therefore propose that the State should lend money to building societies in order to enable them to finance the purchase of new houses. By. this method it is anticipated that the Government would be required to advance less money than in the case of the private builder who is subsidised by the Government.With a view to exploring this matter further the Committee have authorised the Minister of Health and Sir L. Worthington-Evans to meet representatives of. the building societies and to discuss a scheme for the financing of building operations by those societies on the strength of loans from the Government. It is to be clearly explained to the representatives of the societies that the Government are not committed in any way to the adoption of any such scheme, and that the meeting with them bears a purely investigatory character.
6. EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD OF THE SUBSIDY.The Committee have recommended to the Cabinet and the Cabinet have already-approved (Cabinet 37(20), Conclusion 3 of the 24th June) that the subsidy scheme should be extended to cover houses completed before the 31st December, 1921. The reason for this recommendation is that the period during which the grant to persons erecting houses was available terminates at the end of this year (whereas the grant itself would not be exhausted then), and that therefore contracts are being restricted because of the inability to complete the houses within this year.7. LODGMENT OF PLANS IN SCOTLAND.The latest date for the lodgment of plans of new houses in Scotland which are to benefit by the subsidy scheme was the 30th June, 1920. This restriction does not exist in the case of English houses, and the Committee regarded it as likely to diminish the number of plans filed. They therefore authorised the Scottish Board of Health to take the necessary action for the abolition of the restriction of date on the filing of plans in Scotland.8. COURSES OF ACTION WHICH THE COMMITTEE DO NOT RECOMMEND.The Committee have considered the following suggestions and have come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to adopt them : 1. National Wage. It would be undesirable to attempt to bring wages in the building trade to the same level throughout the country.2. Insurance Scheme. It has been suggestedjthat the offer of a &quot; guaranteed week &quot; should be associated with a proposal that the trade should provide itself with a guaranteed week by means of an insurance scheme to be carried out through the medium of the Governments Insurance Act. The Committee consider that such a suggestion would, in the minds of the trade, largely detract from the value of the offer in regard to a guaranteed week and is objectionable on other grounds, viz. :--(a.) That the scheme is an expensive one, and would be in addition to the Government scheme ;(6.) That the proposal Would cover the whole of the industry and effect a permanent arrangement, whereas the proposal for a guaranteed week would affect only operatives engaged in housing during the present scarcity of houses ;(c.) That under the Government insurance scheme unemployed building operatives would get 15s. a week and the Building Trade Unions could bring this sum up to 11. a week. It would be inadvisable on general grounds to allow a man more money than this while he was unemployed.3. Premium Bonus System.-In any suggestion made to the Unions in regard to a system of payment by results no statement should be made which might lead the trade to think that the Government desire to reintroduce the premium bonus system, which possesses such a bad reputation. It is for this reason that the Committee have recommended (see above) that emphasis should be laid on the safeguards attached to the proposed system of payment by results.(Initialled)     R. S. H., Chairman.Uth July, 1920.
APPENDIX.Summary of the Committee^ Recommendations as to the Pro-posals to be made to the Deputation of the Employers&apos; . Associations and the Building Trade Unions.A. PROPOSALS FOR INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF LABOUR.(i.) Grading up of Unskilled Men.Building labourers to be trained as bricklayers, slaters, tilers, plasterers, &amp;c, for six months, working side by side with skilled operatives. To be classed as &quot; learners,&quot; paid labourers&apos; rates for three months, ah intermediate rate for another three months, and then tradesman&apos;s rates.(ii.) Apprentices.The flow of apprentices to the trade to be resumed at the earliest possible moment, and not only youths to be accepted but elder men who have some knowledge of the industry, the latter to serve a somewhat shorter term than was customary in the case of youths indentured in the pre-war period. This term should be two years, and the men should be paid at labourers rate for one year and an intermediate rate between labourer and tradesman during the second year. The ordinary youth apprentice would come under the customary trade conditions.(iii.) Training of New Men.Ex-service men between the ages of 22 to 26 (inclusive) to be admitted to the trade and to go through a course of training. Trainees to be drafted on to housing sites after a short preliminary training, and their final course of instruction to be completed on the actual erection of houses. Trainees to be paid the present training allowances paid to disabled men under the scheme of the Ministry of Labour, and instructors to be paid the salaries customary in Ministry of Labour training centres.In the case of carpenters, joiners and plumbers, trainees would require a longer period of training not less than nine months. At the same time these men are to be utilised for rough carpentry and the manufacture of joinery for housing schemes during the latter period of training.Generally the proportion of learners, apprentices and trainees to skilled men should be one semi-skilled man (learner, apprentice or trainee) to two skilled men, though such a high proportion might not be found possible in the erection of cottages.(iv.) Unemployment Insurance.Fear of unemployment will probably render labour disinclined to grant the above concessions, but the great demands for building labour, which will continue for many years, should be emphasised, and it should be pointed out that building operatives will be insured against unemployment under the Government scheme, and that under the new Act they can make supplementary provision from Trade Union funds.B. PROPOSALS FOR INCREASING OUTPUT.(i.) Guaranteed Week.An offer of a guaranteed week to be made, but details to be formulated by the unions and employers themselves. The following main principles to be laid down in the Governments offer, which should apply only to operatives engaged in building houses: (a.) The offer of a &quot; guaranteed week &quot; means that the men shall not lose their entire wages during loss of time caused by bad weather, but that they shall be paid in accordance with the following principles: (6.) The building trade shall permit a 9 hours&apos; day and a 50 hours&apos; week in the summer and a 7 hours&apos; day and a 39 hours&apos; week in winter in the case of building operatives engaged on housing.
(c.) The guaranteed week shall consist of 35 hours in the summer and 26 hours in the winter at full rates.  The.rest of the times at half ra^es, (d.) The men must remain in attendance on the job throughout the week and onlyleave work when rung off by the proper authority, and shall return to workwhen rung on by the same authority, (e.) Overtime within the limit of fifty hours per week in summer cannot berecognised.   This is justified by the shortness of winter hours. (/.) Normal conditions of service to be applicable otherwise.(ii.) Stoppages and Strikes.There shall be no stoppages or strikes in housing work. Matters of dispute to be dealt with by Conciliation Boards in the ordinary way, and, as a last resort, by the Industrial Court.   &quot; Site stewards &quot; to act through their union.:(iii.) Overtime.Unions to be invited to allow their members to work overtime on housing (when required) at the rates current in the district.(iv.) Payment by Results.A system of payment by results to be urged on the Trade Unions. This system should permit the men to earn substantially higher wages than those yielded by ordinary rates, the Trade Unions to be asked to make specific proposals, and the system to be subject to the following safeguards :-(a.) The men to be consulted in fixing the prices of a particular piece of work.;.. (6.) No cutting of prices after they have been fixed.(c.) Each man to have a guarantee of a minimum wage for an hour&apos;s work of a certain output.The offer of a guaranteed week should be made contingent on the, acceptance of the conditions laid down in (ii), (iii) and (iv).C.  COMPETITION OF CONTRACTORS FOR &amp;ABOUR.,The representatives of the building trades to be informed that unless the contractors and the Trade Unions can create an organisation to prevent undue and unfair competition for labour for housing schemes, the Government will have to legislate in order to prevent payment of wages in excess of the standard rate of wage in any district that may be concerned.
