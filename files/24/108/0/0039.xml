Memorandum &quot;by the President of the BoardTrade.I have been asked to express my views on a proposal which has been put forward by Sir Laming Vvorthington-Bvans for a scheme for ^neutralising Germanyrs advantages from a depreciated market and for collecting an indemnity.&quot;    I propose to consider in the first place, whether the soheme put forward is capable of being put into execution.     In the event of its being found, on examination, not to be practicable - as I think will be the case - I propose to consider next whether there is any possible advantage in any similar soheme which has for its object an increase in the price charged for German goods.    Finally, I propose to discuss some of the aspects of the controversy which has arisen between Sir laming and the Treasury as regards the economic principles which underlie his proposals.Under the existing Treaty of Peace we have no power to impose on Germany a particular system of taxation.    I understand, indeed, that when the Treaty of Peace was being drafted, certain proposals were put forward by tho French which involved an obliga-tion on Germany to levy export duties but that these proposals, for various reasons, were not proceeded with.    ^he presentGermany of any such export duties, but for an agreement between the Allies to impose by common accord sur-taxes upon German goods which oome into their markets, (such sur-taxes to vary with the state of the exchange between each Allied country and Germany), and to pay the proceeds of such sur-taxes into the common fundscheme is not one, however, for requiring the imposition by
which should bo used for tho payment of reparation.     To my mind, it would be impossible to arrive at any such agreement, jThe German Government themselves have recently been requiring exporters of German goods to provo that such goods have been sold to foreigners at substantially higher prices than those charged &quot;in the domestic market, the avowed purpose of this being to assist the rectification of the exchange. They have also imposed export duties of a more conventional description.    The administration of these arrangements has recently formed the subject of consideration by the Oounoil Of Ambassadors in Paris, such&apos; consideration being demoted primarily to the question whether Germany was exercising any discrimination as between exports to different countries^     t understand from a member of my Department who sat on a Committee in Paris for the purpose of investigating this question, that the main complaint which was   made by some of the Allied countries against German procedure, was that it had the effect of making&apos;many German goods which they required, very much&apos; dearer than, in their.opinion they ought to be,     I am convinced that any system whioh aimed at making all German exported goods dearer in the foreign markets into which they were sold would not commend itself to some of our Allies;   and it is of the essence of the scheme that the sur-tax to be applied to German goods should be applied by each importing country to every description of such goods entering the country and consequently not only to those which compete with Home manufactures in the importing country but also to those whioh are urgently required in many European countries for reconstruction purposes.    Apart from this, however,, a rock on whioh any such proposal would, in my opinion, oertainly split would be the attitude of the United States.     I cannot believe that the United States Government would ever agree, or be allowed by Congress to undertake that duties should be
levied on imports of German goods into United States territory when the proceeds of such duties were to be used for the purpose of paying reparationsAs regards the further suggestion that neutral Governments could be induced to impose and collect such a tax for Allied account, it appears to me to be out of the question now to impose upon them measures of compulsion, which may have been possible during the War,     I do not doubt that during the War we were fully justified in using the threat that a particular Neutral1s currency should not be allowed to be dealt with in London unless they complied with certain of our requirements.     To make such a threat in Peace time with the object, not of compelling Germany to carry out her Treaty obligations, but merely of preventing Germany from securing some incidental advantage out of her present deplorable economic position, of which her depreciated mark Is the result, would be a breach of international comity which the circumstances could not be held to justify.     Moreover, the United States, even if they could be induced to impose a sur-tax themselves on German goods, would most certainly refuse to close the New York exchange market to neutrals who did not follow the same course, and it would be disastrous if the principal effect of our action towards neutral countries were to drive those countries from our exchange market to New York,II.For all these reasons I am convinced that the proposal now under consideration is wholly impracticablej   but in view of the forthcoming Conference at Spa, and the possibility of coming to some new arrangements with the Germans in regard to the payment of indemnity, it seems desirable to consider
whether, if it were possible, it would be good policy to require the German Government to levy an export duty on German goods for the purpose of securing a revenue for payment of reparation,     I do not think any such course would be advisable0     I recognise that the large exports from Germany; which the payment of adequate reparation almost certainly involves, may re-act in an unpleasant way on British manufacturers of similar goods, but I am convinced that from every point of view the economic restoration of Germany is ultimately to the advantage of the Allies,     Any policy which has for its object interference with the restoration of German export trade is,, therefore, in the last resort, impolitic.    German recovery is bound to be impeded by any scheme, which by enhancing their price, limits the outlet for her goods..    As moreover, any increase in the price of German goods must be borne by the consumer, we are faced with the objection that, under all schemes of this nature,, the consumers in Allied countries would be paying an appreciable part of the indemnity which Germany owes to the Allies.The measure of Germany&apos;s recovery and capacity to meet the claims on her for reparation is to be found in the volume of her exports.,     In order to pay she must obtain , either gold or foreign currency and to obtain gold or foreign currency, she must export goods in exchange0     It would:, therefore, be highly inadvisable to do anything to check German exports unless it were absolutely necessary for the protection of Allied industries..     The proceeds of any export duties, if impounded for the Allies, would be a small offset against the loss occasioned by the check on exports,,The action, already taken by Germany, referred to above, is not designed or calculated to operate as a protection of
[xvpeljsn JiwlcuBftePtf hut as1 a means^aT preventing the excess! ely cheap sales which the State of her exchanges renders possible.    If It should be found necessary eventually, to take steps to prevent a flood of exports from Germany from affecting certain of our industries very injuriously, I am strongly of opinion that it would be.   II;inexpedient to attempt to achieve the desired end by requiring Germany to impose export duties.    While some of these duties might fail t$ protect our producers in our home market, they might, nevertheless, impede the export to other markets of German goods which are not keenly competing    with-Allied products in those markets.    In the result we might secure by means of such export duties, only a minimum of protection of Allied interests combined with a maximum of discouragement of German exports.     Should it be really necessary at some time in the future for the Allies to shield their industries. It would be far better for each country to take for itself such emergency action a3 was absolutely essential.III.The divergence of views on the subject of the relation of currency-depreciation to the course of foreign.trade appears to t^e based oa a difference of the fundamental hypothec-as as to the order in time of the assumed changes. The theoretical and other authorities quoted by Sir Laming Wo3rthingtori&quot;51vans proceeded on the hypotheses that economic friction, arising from such causes as ignorance on the part of the masses and an unwillingness to alter old habits, would maintain domestic prices and costs near the customary level, even if the currency suffered depreciation in its international value.     The Treasury memorandum, on the other hand, assumes a ready movement of internal prices in response to the creation of large amoxnts, of new currency whose use is limited to home cirouJ-ation, while the foreign exchangesn 5 w

The question is what as sumptions correspond with the conditions under consideration, and the detailed fact3 are difficult to ascertainiwith precision and comprehensiveness.    There is no doubt that the exchange value of the mark fell at one time more rapidly than its purchasing power in Germany.    Moreover, its purchasing power for some purposes has fallen more than for other purposes, and the question which affects us is whether, in respect of the goods of which Germany has supplies available for export, the mark has decreased in purchasing power in a degree commensurate with its depreciation in purchasing power abroad.Though there are prices which appear to suggest that the value of the mark in purchasing some- manufactures of great importance for the German export trade lags little bejaind its measure of value in purchasing foreign goods,x it should not be assumed that in respect of manufactured good3 in general, prices have as yet risen in Germany to anything like the foreign price level when the rate of the exchange is taken into account.    The adjustment of the value of the mark, how-ever, in respect of its purchasing power in Germany to itsWhile the data for a general survey are not available, it may be worth noting in this connexion the relation of Iron and steel prices now and before the war, as quoted in &quot;Stahl und Bison&quot;.    Six years ago haematite pig iron was quoted at M.79*50 at the works on the Ruhr and M.78 to 80 in Upper Silesia.    In March 1920 the price in Upper Silesia was M.2337. Foundry pig No.l was M*70 to 72 in 1914 and in March 1920 was M.1819.    Puddled bars were M*66 to 68 in 1914 and M.1414 at the end of February.    For Siemens-Martin pig the comparison is of M*69 to 72 with M.1469.    For wire rods a price of M,117*50 at Hamm is quoted in April 1914 and M,3,000 for Thomas steel and M.5S50 for Siemens-Martin quality in March 1920.    For industrial fuel the comparison is as follows for the Ruhr districtMarch 1914 M per tonCoking coal 12,25 -13.00Foundry coke 19.00 -21.00Siegerland iron ore, quoted at M.12.60 in 1904, was fixed for May 1920 at M,262,60,April 1920 M per ton 196.10 -197.90 291,20 -293..-00
purchasing power - in other countries is making notable progress.    In the particular case of food, control of prices by the Government has prevented the mark from losing as much in purchasing power as would have occurred otherwise.Moreover, the volume of products available for export from Germany being still but small, the danger to be anticipa--ted from leaving an unhindered course to those goods on the markets of the world, including our own, is also small, and the divergence between the purchasing power of the Mark at home and abroad may be reduced to relatively small proportions before the volume of such goods becomes sufficiently important to be a menace to our industries.    The supplies of goods which were produced from materials acquired before the great fall in the mark here have either been dispersed or will have little effect on the markets of the world.Furthermore, a check to the granting of Credits, (which are essential for the ordinary progress of industry) naturally results from the distrust engendered by the habit of persistent inflation of the currency of a country.    A withdrawal of credit abroad leads to a slump in exchanges and exports become thereby cheap to foreign purchasers.    This gives a stimulus to export, which will either furnish a basis /or the restoration of credits, or, if inflation causes a new spurt in the prices of export goods, such dearer prices will in time check the stream of exports in spite of the fall in exchange.    Any measures which assist in the maintenance of German credit, and particularly any which may tend to enlarge the resources of the German Government, so that resort to continued currency inflation may not be necessary, are likely to be advantageous to the Allies in the long run.H.
