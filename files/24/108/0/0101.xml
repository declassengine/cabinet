OfThreatenea strike oi members of the Elootrteal Trades Unioir in&quot;The event of non-reodgniHoh oFT/iITir UnTojjT V7yTbe&quot; postmaster-Genera&quot;! *        .   &quot;Memorandum by the minister of Labour, Tho Electrical Trades Union have represented to me that the  ostm&amp;ster-General has refused to recognise or meet thera to discuss questions of advances of wages.    They are at present applying for an advance of ail a week for all their members employe in the Engineering Department of the post Office, including the men engaged in the installation, maintenance, and repair of telephonic and telegraphic systems, and claim that the rates paid by the General post Office to the classes of men concerned are considerably less than those paid by the office of rorks.   I am informed that the Postmaster General has refused both in con-noction with the present and previous claims to treat with the Union, on the grounds that it is not representative of the grades in question, and that it hts been the practice of his Department to discuss wages questions with the post office Engineering union, formerly the post office Amalgamated Engineering and Stores Association, which represents the great majority of the employees concerned.The E.T.U., claim, however, that other Government Department have both recognised and negotiated with them in tho matter of wages and conditions and threaten that unless the postmaster-General is prepared similarly to meet and negotiate with thorn they will take immediate steps to withdraw their men from Post Office work throughout the country, and from other Government work,   if carried out, this would doubtless cause serious dislocation and inconvenience to the other Government Departments by whom electricians are employed, and particularly the Office of V/orks, whose practice it has been to negotiate on wages questions with tho Union,
X have discussed the point with, both the postmaster-General and the First Commissioner ox Works,   I appreciate at their full value the considerations which have weighed with the Postmaster-General in coming to the conclusion not to treat with the t,T,.-particularly in face of the fact that he has made agreements with another Union with a very much larger membership. But I think tho position of the postmaster-General and subsequently of the Government (if the matter should dovelop as is threatened) -would bo very much stronger with the public and the House of Commons if the E.T.U. were deprived of the point - which they can at present make - that, while all other Government Departments negotiate with them, the Post Office will not even meet them. 1 am of opinion, therefore, that the postmaster-General (or his officials on hie behalf) might consent to interview the Union representatives even if it wsre only found possible to inform them that the Post Office could not recognise their claim to represent the employees of the Post Office Engineering Department or consider any application for advances in wages whioh they might submit.   At present the Postmaster-General does not see his way to accept this suggestion and as the mttter may prove to be of importance I have agreed with him and with the ^irst Commissioner of Works to submit the point to the Cabinet for decision.If the Postmaster-Generals decision is adhered to, I have no alternative but to inform the E.T.U. that the postmaster-General, having recently concluded a series of wages negotiations! with the Post Office Engineering Union, is not prepared to treat with them separately, and to leave them to consider further what course of action they will adopt.(Initialled)Ministry of I&amp;bour, l .7.fe&apos;0.12/7*858,
