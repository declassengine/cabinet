CONFIDENTIAL.No. 18Economic Conditions and Trade Prospects in Soviet Russia.Economic Conditions and Trade Prospects in Soviet Russia.In. a recent report (Special Report. No. 16) an attempt was made to explain some of the reasons which have made it possible for the Bolsheviks to establish and to maintain their system of government, in spite of considerable opposition to their political and social programme in Russia itself, and in face of the disapproval of the rest of the world. It may be of interest, therefore, especially as M. Krassin, the commercial representa-tive of the Soviet Government, is now in England, to examine, in rather more detail than was possible in the previous report, the existing economic conditions in Russia, to try and form a just estimate of the motives which are now influencing the foreign and domestic policy of the Bolsheviks, and to consider generally the prospects of trade with the Soviet Government.Decline in Working Capacity of the Russian People.It might be supposed that, after the crushing defeat of the white forces and the restoration of peace within its borders, the Soviet Govern-ment would be able speedily to set to work in order to restore the economic condition of the country, and that a period of internal anarchy and civil strife would be followed by a period of energetic industrial revival. Such has not been the case, nor are there any signs that the Bolsheviks, in spite of the most vigorous and dictatorial efforts, are capable of restoring the industrial life of Russia, which their social and political policy has so effectually ruined.* The process of destruction for which they have been responsible has been so thorough and systematic that it has included all branches of inclustry and labour, and the general loss of capacity for work, which is now reported to be the most noticeable characteristic of all classes throughout Russia, including the peasants, is so complete and far-reaching that it is extremely unlikely that even the frantic efforts of Trotsky to inspire &quot; the desire to work &quot; will be crowned with success. This catastrophic state of things may be attributed to the following causes : (1) The absence of any personal stimulus to work ; (2) the fact that wages do not cover even half the cost of living ; (3) the chronic shortage of food, and the consequent bad state of health of the people generally ; (4) the absence of safeguards for personal security; (5) the appointment to responsible administrative posts of persons without the necessary qualifications simply because they are adherents of the Communistic Party ; (6) the persistent sabotage against the Government which is prevalent in e\ery branch of the administration ; (7) the continued mobilization of the Red Armies, which, it is estimated, withdraAvs three and a half million men from productive labour ; and (8) the constant changes made by the Government in its laws and regulations, which cause endless friction and delay in the work of the great chain of departments that are responsible for the administration of the country.When these existing causes of unrest among the peasantry and working classes are borne in mind, and when it is also remembered that* See previous Special Report, No. X6, 0  (33)11343-2 Pkl76 225  7/20 B&amp;S A
for nourly six years the country has been in tho throes, first, of a great foreign war, then of a political and social revolution, then of civil war, it may be taken for granted that, even in the most favourable circumstances, it will not be possible to restore tho desire, or even tho capacity of tho people for work for a long period of time.Industrial Situation.The industrial life of the country is practically at a standstill. The Bolshevik policy of handing over the factories to the management of the workmen, and their efforts at a general nationalisation of industry, led, as they have themselves been forced to admit,* not only to an alarming reduction of output, but also to a state of hopeless and irremediable confusion. The discovery of this fact led to a complete reversion of policy, and the workmen have now, in consequence of a long list of autocratic decrees, been practically transformed into the slaves of the factories or workshops where they happened to be working on the day of the publication of any such decree. A workman is not only forbidden to leave the factory to which he belongs, but he is often not even allowed to remove from one department in it to another. The Bolsheviks have discovered, however, that the breakdown in discipline among the industrial classes for which they are so largely responsible cannot be easily restored. Strikes are of frequent occurrence, and workmen are reported everywhere to be deserting from the factories, and the number of the deserters is increasing rapidly in spite of the severe punishments which are inflicted upon them if they are caught, fIn addition to the loss in productive power caused by the desertion of the workmen, the output of the manufactories in Soviet Russia has been reduced enormously owing to the wholesale destruction and disappearance of machinery, and to the lack of fuel and of raw and semi-manufactured materials.!In the early days of the Bolshevik regime, when the authorities were bent upon&quot; gratifying the primitive instiucts of the &quot; struggling pro-letariat&quot; for plunder, stocks of raw materials and valuable machinery of every description were either wantonly destroyed or carried off from the factories, and all the efforts of the wiser among the revolutionaries to point out the futility of such destruction and waste were ignored. Since that period the incapacity and neglect of the workmen, who were entrusted with the management of factories when the bourgeois managers and technical experts wore dismissed, have completed the work of destruction.As regards the lack of fuel at the present time, which has produced such a critical situation that the Soviet authorities have been obliged to issue the most stringent regulations with regard to fuel consumption,^ it must be remembered that even before the war Russia suffered from an* See previous Special Report, No. 16.I As an example of the wholesale desertions which are taking place, it is reported that the metal workers in the Pavlovsk district in the Nijninovgorod Province have left the area, and entire hamlets are empty and boarded up.J The decline in the industrial output is so prodigious that it is almost impossible to speak seriously of the productive power of the various manufactories in Russia. Although in published reports the decline in production is quoted at 25 per cent, aud 30 per cent, below the average rate of production before the revolution, experts consider that it is now impossible even to attain to an average production equal to 10 per cent, of the output in the same works previous to 1917.5 Many works and factories have been closed owing to lack of fuel, and the passenger service on several lines suspended. Special Soviets and committees have been appointed to organise compulsory labour for felling and transporting wood. The price of wood at Petrograd is 16,000 roubles per Russian fathom (7 by 7 feet)..
inadequate supply of fuel for the requirements of its metal industries.* It is reported (hat during the revolution tho Don coal mines, and the rock oil works in the Grozno district, were completely destroyed.! It has been necessary, therefore, to cut down timber in vast quantities as the only remaining form of fuel.Before the war, also, the situation in Russia with regard to the supply of raw materials for manufacturing purposes was somewhat critical. The Avar naturally destroyed the production of raw materials in the country, and considerably reduced their import from abroad. Since the revolution the internal chaos, the failure of the transport service, and the lack of fuel have practically ended the production of raw materials throughout Russia.J With regard to the textile and other industries the position is equally serious. Since October 1917 ninety-one spinning and weaving factories have been closed down, and similar reductions have been made in the number of other manufacturing concerns. It is estimated that not more than 30 per cent, of all the mills iu Russia are working to-day.Transport.The Supreme Council of the National Economy Department of the Republic fully recognises the gravity of the industrial situation, and is directing ita main energies to the restoration of the means of internal communication, and of transport facilities in general, without which it is clear that no amelioration of existing conditions is possible. The task before the Bolsheviks, however, is a colossal one, because every form of transport has broken down. The railways in particular are in a bad state of repair, and the lack of locomotives and rolling stock is becoming acute. The number of new locomotives produced in the workshops continues to decrease,^ and the production of railway trucks is also far behind requirements. The repair of locomotives has declined, and it is now only possible to repair 15 per cent, of those which are sent to be overhauled because the stocks of spare parts are almost completely exbaustedjiind hi order to repair a locomotive it is necessary to remove the requisite parts from other locomotives, with the resulc that out of seven damaged engines it is usually only possible to repair one.In addition to the lack of rolling stock, the railway engineers are hard put to it to cope with the absence of proper f ueljj and lubricating oils, nor is it possible for them to obtain soft metal for the bearings and for the renewal of the tyres of the wheels or the worn-out springs of the trucks.f* In 1913, which was a record year for the smelting of cast iron, there was a great fuel crisis. In that year it was estimated that 3J milliard poods of mineral fuel were expended, of which half a milliard was imported from abroad.f The decrease in the output of other coal mines in Russia should be noted. The Moscow Government coalmines, which produced 15,000,000 poods(1 pood equals 3G English lbs.) in 1916, only produced about 2,000,000 poods in 1919. The coal mines of the Ryazan Government, which produced 15,000 poods a day in 1915-16, now only produce 150 poods daily.t The iron-casting industry in the UraJ and Southern Russia, the output of which between 1900 and 1913 increased by 60 per cent., has ceased to exist, owing to the lack of raw materials and fuel. It is impossible to count upon the speedy revival of this industry, even it transport difficulties could be overcome, first, because the region has been ravaged by war, and. secondly, because the factories were so out of date, as regards technical implements, that it would be safer to say that a new industry must be created than an old one reconstituted.S In the whole republic the output of locomotives is reported not to exceed 50 per annum, as against 800 to 1,000 before the revolution.II Firewood which has only recently been cut down, and which is still quite green and wet, is being used as fuel for locomotives.It is reported that at the present time there is only one Marten furnace in working order at the Kulebak Works producing the necessary steel for this purpose.A 2
It is rather amusing that, at a time &quot;when the process of the destruction of the existing railway system is almost complete, the Soviet Government should solemnly state that it is considering the question of the electrifica-tion of the system, but this proposal, like so many other of the Bolshevik published announcements, is no doubt intended to deceive the outside world as to actual conditions in Russia. Krassin himself, who is an experienced engineer, is reported to have expressed the opinion that in the best conditions it would be impossible to restore tho railways before 1928, and that this would only be possible if the russian metal industry could be revived by 1927, with the assistance of German experts. Engineers in Russia as a whole appear to be even less optimistic than Krassin, and consider that even to meet the existing requirements of the country it will be necessary to expend at least 3,000,000,000 roubles in gold. Meanwhile, the Government, as in other branches of industry, is placing its hopes for the restoration of the railways on the work of the &quot; labour army,&quot; but, even if this forced labour were proving successful  which seems extremely doubtful the absence of all the requisite materials, to which allusion has already been made, would render its work of little practical value.Water transport in Russia is little more satisfactory than railway transport. It is reliably reported that only about 3 per cent, of the river steamers are not in need of repair, and that the carrying capacity of the Soviet mercantile fleet is only about 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of that of the vessels engaged on inland traffic in 1913. !STo new vessels are being built,* and, in addition to this, the ports and waterways have been entirely neglected. It may be estimated, therefore, that a very large sum of money will be required before this form of transport can be restored to anything approaching its normal capacity before the revolution.Road transport in Soviet Russia is iioay practically non-existent. This is owing to the dearth of horses,f but, even if horses were available, the difficulty and expense of keeping up the supply of horse shoes, nails, tyres, runners for sledges, &amp;c, would make impossible the effective maintenance of this form of transport.Agriculture.Although it is reported that the peasants, largely owing to their illicit traffic in foodstuffs, are richer than they were before the revolution, the economic situation in the agricultural districts generally is in view of the fact that Russia is, in the main, an agricultural country still more alarming than it is in the towns. The decline in the number of horses working on the land J is a disaster which cannot be over-estimated, because, although the Soviet Government has recently been endeavouring to induce the peasants to use tractors for ploughing, there has been* This is said to be largely due to the fact that the cost of building ships is rising rapidly, and that available freights are not sufficient to meet the expense. As an example of the cost of shipbuilding it may be stated that a poud (? 63 lbs.) costs 25,000 Soviet roubles. .f Since 1917 the number of horses in Russia generally is reported to have decreased about 70 per cent., and in the , towns the average decrease is even higher In Moscow, for instance, in March of this year there were only 8,000 horses as corn-pared with 136,000 in 1914. The principal reason for the reduction in the number o horses is probably due to the scarcity and high price of fodder. Oats cost 5,000 roubles per poud and hay 400 roubles per poud. In addition to this, it has been found impossible to replenish the supply of horses with horses from the Steppes, owing to the prevalence of glanders and other diseases among them.% In some districts it is reported that there is only one-horse to every 150 dessiatiens (405 acres) of arable land.
no general acceptance of them, nor had the peasants shown any incliiia-tion to use them, would it have been possible for the Government to supply them in anything like sufficient quantities. The last harvest was a bad one, owing to unsatisfactory cultivation, the lack of fertilisers, and to poor seed. It has been found impossible to bring seed from Siberia for this year&apos;s sowing owing to lack of transport, and the supply of available seed will not be sufficient for more than 20 per cent, of the ground usually under cultivation. The much-advertised &quot; Soviet estates &quot; do not appear to have come up to the high expectations that were formed of them, aud it is doubtful whether, in the majority of cases, they have produced sufficient grain to feed the labourers employed upon them. The peasants generally, whose unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Government and its agents shows no sign of abatement, have reduced their sowings to meet their own requirements, and display no inclination to produce food for the population of the towns. Kor are there in the country districts any large stocks of grain, flax, hemp, seeds, or animal products to the existence of which optimists in this country and elsewhere sometimes allude.It is doubtless the present object of the Bolsheviks to represent Soviet Russia as a land overflowing with the foodstuffs and other commodities of which the world stands most in need, and to explain to foreign Governments and foreign financiers that, if ouly they will assist in the restoration of the Russian transport system, they will profit by the stored-up riches of Russia. It should be remembered, however, that the domestic policy of the Soviet Government, since the earliest days of its dictatorship, has beeu entirely directed in favour of the industrial proletariat of the towns at the expense of the agricultural community. Its establishment of a system of high prices for manufactured goods out of all proportion to the prices obtainable for country produce, and the constant requisitions upon the peasants which it was obliged to make in order to feed and clothe the Red Armies, resulted t&apos;m the practical clearance of all existing stocks, and offered no kind of inducement or encouragement to the peasants to set to work to replenish them. The result has been the destitution, almost amounting to famine, which to-day exists in the cities and towns of Russia.Financial Position o! the Soviet Government.It is not easy to form an exact estimate of the financial position of the Soviet Government, because it is not possible to rely entirely upon the figures published in the Bolshevik Budgets. Even the official organ of the Government, the &quot; Economic Life,&quot; in an article on the Budget for 1919, complains that it is impossible to say how far it is to be trusted, because &quot; the figures given do not represent the actual conditions of &quot; economic life ; thus we have no actual data regarding the nationalised &quot; industries, the conditions of transport, expenditures of local and central &quot; Soviets, Council of Commissars, &amp;c.&quot; The article concludes with an expression of opinion that it might be advisable for the Government to adopt serious methods of accounting, based on the practice of capitalist states.But, although the actual figures may not be correct, the totals of the expenditure and income for the first half of the financial year 1919 are sufficient to show that the national deficit amounts to 30,350,000,000 roubles, and that every item in the Budget, with the exception of the beet sugar, spirit refining, and timber industries, all of which ha^e been nationalised, shows a deficit.
The financial position, therefore, of the Soviet Government cannot be described as brilliant, and it is difficult to see how it can be improved. The Bolsheviks originally adopted the simple expedient of a limitless issue of wholly unguaranteed paper currency, and it was not until 1919 that their Government undertook its first serious financial reform by issuing its own special &quot; Soviet Money,&quot; boaring the design of a sickle and &quot;hammer, and the inscription &quot;Proletariat of the World Unite.&quot;* When this new currency was issued, the intention was to cancel the paper notes of previous Governments, and ultimately to adopt a policy by. which currency would assume the simple role of &quot;ration cards for food products,&quot; but so far no such cancellation has taken place. As the Bolsheviks are now making every effort to get into touch with foreign countries, it seems unlikely that they will attempt to annul old issues of paper money, of which a large proportion is out of Russia. It is not quite clear, however, what kind of financial system the Bolsheviks will employ in their dealings with foreigners.They are apparently prepared to conduct affairs so as to bring their economic system and the capitalist system together &quot;in the interests of mutual trade and welfare,&quot; and it is reported that they are considering a scheme of financial reform which provides for an entirely new currency, guaranteed not by a metal but by a goods reserve. This would imply .&quot; cheques on goods,&quot; the goods being the products of the State which controls the country&apos;s industries. Meauwhile, however, the Soviet Government is explaining to the Russian proletariat that, in order to increase production, it must resort to the methods of the capitalists, and is issuing more and more paper money.Possibilities o  Export Trade.If the facts to which attention has been drawn namely, the complete breakdown of the transport system throughout Russia, the collapse of the industries of the country, and the enormous reduction in its agricultural production are taken into consideration, it is difficult to see how there can be any material improvement in the internal conditions of the country for some time to come, even if there is an immediate resumption of commercial relations with the outside world. It is still more difficult to see how any such commerce is to be carried on when there are no means of transport in Russia and when there is apparently so little to be exported from the country. It is unlikely that the Soviet Government will have the courage to requisition the insignificant supplies of grain and flax held by the peasants ;f and timber, of which there is, of course, a plentiful supply, cannot easily be exported because the Government is* The issue of this &quot;Soviet Money&quot; had a curious sequel, which caused the Bolsheviks considerable surprise and prevented them from carrying into effect their policy of destroying the value of raoney. The population generally, and the peasants in particular, appear to have distrusted the new issue, with the result that all &quot;Czarist,&quot; &quot;Duma,&quot; and &quot;Kerensky&quot; notes quickly disappeared from circulation and were carefully hoarded. When the Kaluga Soviet gave orders for searches to be carried out with a view to the confiscation of the old issues, 18 million roubles in notes were found in seven villages.-f Some competent observers who distrust the bona fides of the Bolsheviks in their professed desire to reopen trade with the Allied Powers, except as a means, of relieving their immediate necessities and of restoring the waning influence of their Government, consider that their real intention may be further to exploit the peasants .in order to arouse a general outcry in Russia against the Allies, particularly Great Britain, upon whom would be laid the onus of their exactions. In support of this view of the situation, it is pointed out that the Bolsheviks, while negotiating with the Allies, are carrying on an agitation in Russia in favonr&apos;of Germany, urging that the late war was provoked by Great Britain, first, as a means of getting rid of Germany as a commercial competitor, and secondly, to destroy Russia, whose military power in the East was considered dangerous.
unable to undertake its felling or transport. The &quot; Labour Army &quot; has been given, among other tasks, the work of felling timber ; hut the need of fuel throughout the country is so great that it is improbable that the labours of the army avj&apos;11 be more than sufficient to supply the require-ments of the railways, of the factories, and towns. It should also be noted that the &quot;Labour Army,&quot; owing to the practical impossibility of supplying it with food in the devastated districts from which wood is usually felled for exportation, can only carry out this particular work in areas in the east of Russia, from which, even before the war, it was found impracticable to export timber abroad.There has been considerable advertisement of the ability of the Bolsheviks to export flax and grain, but, as has already been pointed out in this report, it is fairly clear that there is no appreciable amount of these commodities left in Russia. Even in the provinces of Kostroma, Tver, and Pskov, the great flax-producing centres, it is reported that the supplies have either been consumed by the peasants themselves, or requisitioned and worked up into textiles or pyroxyline.* With regard to wheat, it must be remembered that the production has declined by at least two-thirds since before the war. If, therefore, in 1914 it was only possible for the Russians, after satisfying their own needs on an extremely low scale, to export 15 per cent, of their wheat crop, it is fairly clear that they will be unable to spare any wheat for exportation now, or in the near futnre.f It is probable that the Bolsheviks are relying upon their ability to provide naphtha for export purposes, and this was doubt-less their principal motive for advancing into the Caucasus and taking-possession of Baku. But again they are faced with the difficulties of transport.It would seem, therefore, that if trade relations are to be reopened with Soviet Russia it is of little use anticipating the export from Russia of any large bulk of raw materials, or, indeed, of any commodities for which transport is required.If it were not for political considerations, there would be a great advantage in requiring from the Bolsheviks,, as a preliminary to the resumption of trade, the transfer of the gold, silver, and platinum reserves to this country as payment for goods, and to exercise supervision over the kind of goods imported into Russia. Without the precious metals theBolsheviks would be unable to carry on propaganda abroad, and theirf* Flax in Russia is now &quot;controlled,&quot; and, consequently, the peasants abstain from its culture over and above their own personal needs. In addition to this flax, there is a lack of chemical manures in llussia, and without them it cannot give a crop. Owing to the use of linseed for oil-crushing purposes (linseed oil is quoted at 1,200 roubles per pound), thei&apos;3 is also great difficulty in finding sufficient quantities of it for sowing purposes. All the available hemp is being used for the production of paper money.f The Bolsheviks were counting upon being able to seize the corn in the Ukraine, but they were unable, owing to the bad state of transport, to remove it when they had the opportunity. The Siberian grain, owing to the long distance it had to travel, and the block on the lines, cannot be exported to Russia. The corn from the Viatka province has already been consumed. The corn-growing districts of the Southern Volga are famine-stricken, owing to their recent occupation by the Red Armies, whose practice it was to lay waste whole districts before moving forward to new places where grain could be obtained.I In dealing with the Bolshevik Government, the well-known letter of Tchicherin to President Wilson which is still the gospel of Bolshevik foreign&apos;policy and is displayed in all Government offices in Soviet Russia should be remembered. In this letter Tchicherin declares that the Communist party does not consider the existing bourgeois Governments as legally constituted, and that it is merely treating with them because it is compelled to do so by force of circumstances owing to the fact that the individuals who should replace nionarchs and presidents are at present languishing in prisons.
power for evil in this and other respects would be seriously crippled. While the Poles and General WrangelVi force are in the field it would, of course, be idle to expect that they would concede a demand for the surrender of the arms and equipment of the Red Armies, in order to ensure that the so-called Labour Army may no longer be employed as a military force against the Allies, or for the purposes of civil war, though such a surrender would greatly, simplify the international situa-tion.Concessions.The Soviet Government realises that, without&quot; the active assistance and co-operation of foreigners, it will not be able to revive the industries of Russia, and, therefore, it is always advertising its readiness to grant concessions as a means of restoring the trade and financial balances. Krassin himself has clearly defined the terms on which such concessions would be granted. These terms would bind any corporation or individuals to whom any territory was conceded to pay the same rates of wages, and to be bound by the same regulations with regard to labour, as those in force in Soviet Russia, and to recognise and to submit to the sovereignty of the republic. It is unlikely that such conditions would enable con-cessions to be worked profitably, either in the interests of the conces-sionaires or of the population of Russia, particularly if there is any truth in the report that the duration of no concession would be longer than 20 years. The conditions prove also that the Bolsheviks, in offering concessions to foreigners, have no intention of allowing them any real freedom of action, or of relinquishing their own hold over any part of the country. It has even been suggested that the profit which.is to be guaranteed by the Soviet Government to concessionaires is only designed to enable the Bolsheviks to maintain, at the public expense, the existing military organisation of. the &quot; Labour Army.&quot; Would-be concessionaires should remember the Bolshevik axiom &quot; A rille in the hands of a work-man is the best means of fighting the bourgeoisie.&quot;Position ol the Co-operative Societies.When the question of reopening trade with Soviet Russia was first discussed the intention was to deal entirely wit1) the co-operative societies, in order to avoid any direct recognition of the existing Govern-ment in Russia. It may be useful, therefore, to examine how far such a policy is possible. There is no doubt that those members of the Soviet Government who are alive to the absolute importance of the restoration of foreign trade, and are responsible for the present negotiations, are anxious to give the impression abroad that the co-operatives are in-dependent of the control of the Bolsheviks, whilst it is also quite clear that they are determined that this ostensible independence shall in no way interfere with the general economic policy of their Government. In other words, they are not prepared to recognise or to tolerate any form of private enterprise in Russia. This is amply proved by a long series of decrees and resolutions which have recently been issued with the object of subordinating the co-operative societies to communist authority. The general effect of these measures may be -summarised as follows :  (1) All the inhabitants of Soviet Russia are now compelled to belong to some co-operative organisation ; (2) Consumers&apos; co operative organisations must be formed in every district, and are required to send their Communist representatives to the central unions ; (3) In addition to the compulsory organisations, permission may be obtained from the Government for the formation of volunteer co-operative organisations of a type similar to the group co-operative institutions in Denmark ; (4) The participation of
these volunteer organisations in the general political policy of the Govern-mentally. is not obligatory, but their independent influence on the Co-operative Central Union is negligible. This is ensured by the fact that, their representatives on the union must already he members of that union, and also because tho representatives of the compulsory consumers&apos; organisa-tions, and of the Communist Party workers, are in a vast majority on that body;* and (5) Agricultural and industrial co-operatives may only organise their societies with the permission of the various local authorities to which they are subordinated, and with the sanction of the Supreme Committee of Co-operative Affairs.It is obvious, therefore, that the Soviet Government is enforcing the strictest discipline among the co-operatives, and that it proposes to retain in its own hands the economic policy of the country. As an example of the minuteness of its system of control, it may be stated that the industrial co-operatives have been divided into groups in accordance with the various branches of industry, and that every group is subordinated to a controlling department of the Government. This means that a co-operative society, for the wholesale purchase of any material, is entirely dependent upon the branch of the Supreme Soviet of People&apos;s Economy which deals with this particular form of material. It would appear that Litvinoff was only speaking the truth, therefore, if at Copenhagen he made the remark with which he is credited, that, in dealing with the co-operative societies, foreigners would be dealing with the Soviet Government.Bolshevik Window Dressing.If the economic conditions in Soviet Russia are as bad as they are represented in this report, the question will uaturally be asked, &quot; What are the inducements which are influencing foreign Governments and foreign financiers to resume commercial relations with the Bolsheviks? &quot; Putting aside entirely the desire for the restoration of peace,&apos;and the other political considerations which must weigh with statesmen who are responsible for the foreign policies of their countries, it is tolerably clear that business men would not be willing to open up trading relations with the Bolsheviks unless they believed that there was an opportunity for successful commercial enterprise in Russia. It is part, therefore, of the policy of the Soviet Government at the present time to impress European public opinion in its favour, and to give the impression to foreigners that there are great openings for the expenditure of capital in Russia.! Everything is done to deceive foreign visitors as to the actual economic situation in the country, and the Bolsheviks are careful only to permit the entrance of foreign journalists who are ready to write in their favour. Hardly any newspaper correspondent is allowed into Russia who has not already shown himself well disposed towards the existing Government, and even then he is only given leave to stay in the country for three weeks. During this period he is the guest of the Soviet Foreign Office, which has now* As a farther safeguard, the Soviet authorities have decreed that &quot; All agricultural and industrial co-operatives of the first category (i.e., the compulsory organisations), whether or not they exist independently, as well as non-consumers&apos; sections of the consumers&apos; societies (as distinguished from the compulsory organisations), are, in respect to industrial and economic questions, subordinated to, and controlled by, District Departments and the Soviet of People&apos;s Economy, all their names being registered by the latter.&quot;f Krassin&apos;s mission to England is no doubt designed for this purpose. It is com-posed of railway and co-operative experts, moderate men who are capable of speaking reasonably with regard 10 the development of Russians resources, and are ready to grant large concessions to British capitalists. Their moderation and adaptability are calculated to impress both Capitalism and Labour in this country, but they do not represent Bolshevik opinion.
three large houses reserved for the accommodation of foreign journalists. Au interpreter, who is a reliable Bolshevik in tho employment of the Soviet Foreign Office, is attached to each visitor, and acts as his inter-preter, guide, and warder. As a result of this precaution no correspon-dent can see anyone, or go anywhere, without the knowledge and permission of the Soviet Foreign Office.* The press censorship, which is controlled by the Foreign Office, is also very severe, and it is safe to say that no correspondent can send out of Russia any information which in the slightest degree reflects upon the conduct of the Soviet Government, or describes conditions in Russia in terms which are not complimentary to the Bolsheviks. If within his three weeks&apos; residence in the country a correspondent fails to write something favourable about the Bolsheviks he is usually compelled to leave Russia. Although no self-respecting journalist would tolerate such conditions, it is obvious that the Bolshevik system offers considerable temptations to an unprincipled man who is merely out fornews, and realises the advantage of being on the spot. He is maintained entirely at the expense of the Soviet Government, motor cars are placed at his disposal, money is advanced to him, and he is not even asked to pay for the radios which be dispatches. It is not surprising, therefore, that the news from Soviet Russia which appears in some newspapers is apt to be deceptive, and calculated to give a wrong impression of the conditions prevailing in the country.A similar system of supervision to that which is exercised over newspaper correspondents is used for other visitors who go to Russia. They are carefully shepherded by Bolshevik agents, and it is fair to assume that they see and hear nothing which they are not intended to see or hear. This may possibly account for the rosy accounts of life in the Soviet Republic which have been published, on their return from Russia, by some of the political enthusiasts who have been guests of the Bolsheviks. It is reasonable to suppose that only the bright side of the picture was shown to them.fIt is clear, however, that the Bolsheviks, by their clever manipulation of the press, and their successful management of visitors, have succeeded in concealing from the outside world much of the truth with regard to actual conditions in Russia. This, combined with their propaganda,^ which is still as active as ever, and is now being employed in Europe largely for the purpose of persuading the commercial classes of the honest intentions of the Soviet Government with regard to its overtures for the renewal of trade, will no doubt have considerable influence among enter-prising business men who are ready to believe that the reports of the Bolshevik atrocities and methods of government have been grossly exaggerated, and that the development of Russia affords great possibilities for the investment of capital.German and other Foreign Trade Competition in Russia.Now that the question of the restoration of trade with Soviet Russia is under consideration, it is not surprising that the fear of the Germans* When Mr. Copping, of the Daily Chronicle., was; in Moscow he was not even allowed to go to church, as it was feared that the sermon of Mr. North, the British chaplain, might influence him against the Bolsheviks.t There is evidence to show that the British Labour Delegates who have lately been in. Russia were carefully watched and attended by the Bolshevik authorities.% The propaganda schools iii Soviet Russia are still maintained. Posts as1 instructors in them have been offered to manv British subjects. In choosing their agents thu Bolsheviks are careful to select individuals whose appearance would help them to pass as natives of the country to which they are to be sent. It is reported that at&apos;the present time particular attention is being paid to propaganda in Italy. &apos;        &apos;
and other foreigners securing a practical monopoly of it is prevalent in this country. Even those who realise that at the present time the prospects of remunerative trade with Russia are not bright, and who distrust the Bolsheviks, are yet anxious to obtain a foothold in the country in view of the re-establishment of a sane form of government, which they consider sooner or later to be inevitable.The presence of a German mission in Moscow, which has been sent secretly by the German Government, and is reported to have concluded an agreement with the Bolsheviks by which 100,000 skilled German workmen are to be.brought into Russia, and to be allowed the privilege of working together in their own way, under their own superiors, and with no Russian supervision, certainly seems to prove that the Germans are determined to seize the chance of exploiting Russia, and that the Bolsheviks are ready to receive them. It is said, however, that the members of the German mission, after what they have seen of the factories in Moscow, are doubtful whether it will be possible to restore Russian industry, and that the social regime of the,Bolsheviks, particularly ikeir ideas with regard to marriage and the education of children, has filled them with horror.* In spite of this bourgeois prudery, it is evident that the German penetration of Russia has begun, and that the dislike which the Russians formerly had for the Germans is far less noticeable than it used to be. It should also not be forgotten that Krassin,who, as Commissary for Trade and Industry, is practically the economic dictator of the country, was formerly an employee in a German engineering firm, and is credited with strong pro-German leanings.An&apos; arrangement by which 4,000 Swedish mechanics are to be sent to Russia, on the same extra-territorial conditions as the Germans, is also being negotiated between the Bolshevik and Swedish Govern-ments. The Swedes have already learned by experience the risk of doing business with the Russians, as, even before the blockade was raised, they contrived to send a cargo of merchandise into Russia. They were to be paid in copper, which was to te shipped in exchange. This cargo was seized by the Bolshevik, sailors, and the Swedes got nothing. If traders are counting upon the exchange of commodities with the Bolsheviks, they must be prepared for incidents of this kind. Nor does it appear to be entirely safe for enterprising business men to travel to Russia in order to see for themselves the possibilities of opening tip a trade connection. It is reported that a Dutch merchant who succeeded in getting to Moscow to do business with the Soviet Covern-ment became pessimistic about the situation, and that, on his refusal to come to terms with the Bolsheviks, he was not allowed to leave the country. In spite of these drawbacks to commercial enterprise, it is clear that the prospect of secuiing a hold of the Russian market is attracting the business community all over the world, whilst it is equally clear that the Bolsheviks, to secure their own ends, are clever enough to avail themselves of the opportunity of availing themselves of international rivalry.Political Situation of the Soviet Government.The failure of Communism, as a practical method of carrying on the political, social, and economic working of a great modern State, is now* The&apos;laxity with regard to marriage seems to have specially shocked the Germans. One of them complained that, at a dinner given in his honour by the Bolshevik authorities, he met a lady who had been the wife of one commissary.in the morning and was a wife.of another c immissary in the evening. Moth husbands were present at the dinner. The German was doubtful as to whether the average German mechanic or the average German mechanics wife would approve of this state of things.
amply apparent. As was pointed out in a previous report, many of tlie&apos; Bolsheviks themselves quite appreciate this fact, and are gradually beginning to readjust their system of government on bourgeois lines with the result that a new bureaucratic machine is in course of con-struction in Russia, more despotic in its influence in the affairs of private individuals than that of the Tzars. There are no grounds for supposing, however, that the Bolsheviks have definitely renounced their programme for the social reform of the world. They are aware of the critical conditions with which they arc now faced, and their primary object is to weather the storm. The party, however, is divided as to the wisest way of overcoming its present difficulties. The Extremists, the best known leaders of whom are Dzerdjinski and Zinovieff, still aim at world revolution, and urge that intensive terrorism is the only means by which the Soviet Government can be maintained in power. The Moderates, of whom Lenin and Krassin are the recognised leaders, are prepared, temporarily at any rate, to modify their social programme/ and to come to a modus vivendi with bourgeois Governments, in order to obtain foreign assistance in the work of the economic restoration of Russia. They are reported to be ready to amalgamate with other advanced groups, in order that the next regime in Russia may adhere as far as possible to the doctrines of Karl Marx. The Opportunists, whose chief leader is Trotsky, are intriguing between the other two groups and are undecided whether to throw in their hand with the Ex-tremists or the Moderates. Trotsky&apos;s influence is still predominant in the Red armies, and his and his adherents&apos; attitude will be influenced mainly by military considerations. If the Red armies hold together and succeed in driving back the Poles, Trotsky may become definitely hostile to Lenin and the Moderates. Although, therefore, judging by recent reports, the stability of the. Soviet Government is less assured than it was a short time ago, there is no reason to suppose that it is tottering to its fall. It has destroyed its most dangerous enemies, and its hold over the country seems fairly secure.! Its absolute control of the press, and its thorough and wonderfully organised system of propaganda, have succeeded in capturing public opinion, and in impressing upon the Russian people the greatness of its achievements and the strength of its position throughout the world. Its social programme is unpopular with the peasants, but the Bolshevik leaders have had the wisdom to desist from trying to enforce the full gospel of Communism. There is no rival power in Russia to challenge the supremacy of the Soviet Government.* Two recent declarations issued by Lenin show that he has not really changed his political views. The first annuls all agreements made by private persons and companies with regard to minerals, and transfers the ownership in them to the Soviet Government; the other forbids landowners to sell or dispose of their land.f The demoralisation of the inhabitants of the towns, due to the terror inspired by the Bolshevik methods of espionage and corruption, and the want of food, and disease, is said to be complete, and no organised revolt against their Government can l:e anticipated. The opposition of the peasants is more dangerous to the Government, but so long as the Bed armies remain firm it cannot be considered as serious.The following remarks, attributed to Zinovieff, probably illustrate the situation fairly accurately. When a visitor remarked that the Bolsheviks were all-powerful, he replied Supposing 1 issued a decree that all the bourgeois should come at a &quot; fixed hour to the parade ground to be flogged, this is what would happen 98 per &quot; cent, would come. Of these, half would present medical certificates that they were &quot; unfit for flogging, a quarter would produce certificates to show that they had been &quot; flogged already, 15 per cent, would produce ceitifieates to show that they were &quot; students and that a flogging would interfeie with the success of their examinations, &apos;&apos; and the remainder would pay money to the guards to let them off. But if I gave &quot; an older that every peasant was to present himself on the parade ground at a fixed &quot; hour to do a job of work, less than 2 per cent, would turn up. That shows howfar ,; our power extends.&quot;
It has defeated all its serious opponents, and, in spite of a certain amount of resistance to its rule, it controls the whole country by its network of officials and secret agents. Its only serious causes for anxiety are the problem of the demobilization of the army, and the chaotic economic coudi-tions which prevail throughout Russia.If the Bolsheviks, therefore, can secure peace, aud during the course of the demobilization of their forces can obtain foreign financial and economic assistance, they may succeed iu preserving their power, and at the same time in extending their political propaganda abroad. Some observers consider that in granting facilities to foreigners to enter Russia the Bolsheviks may be endangering their hold over the country, and this argument has been brought forward in support of the restoration of trade relations with Soviet Russia. It is unlikely, however, that such astute political leaders as Lenin and his immediate adherents will run any risks of this kind, and, unless the terms of the concessions to be granted are different from those sketched out by Krassin before leaving Russia, it is obvious that the position of foreigners in that country will not be such as to enable them to enlighten the people as to the inability of the Bolsheviks to carry out their world-wide communist programme ; indeed, it is far more probable that the return of foreigners to Russia will do much to convince the people of the triumphant progress of Bolshevism, and that any improvement in the economic situation will add to the prestige of the Soviet Government.Printed by Eyre and spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C.4.
