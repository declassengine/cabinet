, &quot; Xi iVs2(P 4995) From Viceroy, 24th June 1920....   (Received 26th, 10.30 a.m&apos;.j  -. 773..S; Mussoorie Conference.Following, telegram from. Dobbs No. .78.S., 23rd June, repeated, for informa-&quot;We ihad a long discussion this morning on Afghan instigation of our tribes and their (? suggested) frontier concessions.   Afghans, while admitting past instiga- . tions, assured me that if outcome of the conference is friendship we shall have nothing further to complain of in this respect.&quot;With regard to frontier concession, I demolished Afghan arguments that tribes such, as those of Waziristan should be granted self-determination, and stated clearly that we cannot, possibly contemplate such measures, and cannot hand over key to frontier to others. Afghan delegates made very,feeble response, and have apparently no intention of making (? a) stand. I shall probably announce our&apos;Mahsud policy to-morrow.&quot; -- -      -Dobbs further reports that Tarsi has received letters from Kabul, which makes him very anxious-to return iii order to retrieve the loss of. personal influence, and that it may be difficult to keep him at Mussoqrie much longer.Very early orders on my telegram of 19tbJune last, No. 759 S., are therefore ofurgent, importance. .
