1MU.QCU^NT IS TO PROPERTY OF HIS BKMMNIC lhTTCTY[g . GOVETOW \CABIN3T.-POgQglGE AND TSLBGl^P^BILL,,HElHORMDtDj. - V &apos;   -Clause- 1.    Tho maximum rates chargeable for Postcards (id) and for Printed Papers (&amp;i for 1 oz. Id between 1 oz. and 2 oz. and $d. for each additional 2 02.) are at presentfixed by statute.    This Clause will enable new rate$ to be-fixed by Treasury warrant, after the conclusion of the Postal Union Congress to be held at Ivfedrid in October. The new Inland rates will mainly depend upon the foreign rates to be fixed at the Congress,Clause. II,   (l) Imposes an additional charge of-Id on the transmission of each newspaper by post:(3) Raises the charge for a telegram to 1/r for 12 words plus Id for each additional word and imposes a new charge of \&apos;:6d on each telegram handed in on Sundays, Christmas-Day or Good Friday.Clause III.    Gives statutory authority to an agreement arrived at between the Post Office, Ministry of Transport and the Treasury that the remuneration payable to Railway Companies for the conveyance of parcels should he raised to 6qfi above the. pre-war standard, so long as Government control over the.Railways continues.The remainder of the Clause provides for- a considerable simplification in the machinery for computing the payments to the Railway. Companies.    It is . understood that the Railway Companies will offer no objection to the system proposed.Clause IV,    The Post Office Act 1908, which was aconsolidating
consolidating statute, continued the privileges conferred upon soldiers-and sailors at the beginning of the nineteenth century when Postage rates were much higher.    This section provides that a privileged person (which term is defined as including, every non-commissioned officer, soldier or sailor in His Majesty4s Forces) shall be entitled to send or receive letters not exceeding \ 03. in weight &quot;at a postage of one penny, whether at Home or abroad, provided (a) that the letter is on their own private concerns:   (b) that the envelope bears the name, regiment, ship etc..of the writer: and (c) that ii shall be certified in his own handwriting by the Commanding Officer.The privilege has in practice for many years been a dead letter, but as the higher rates of poet age now charged may lead individuals to attempt to take advantage of it, it seems desirable to repeal the. section.    Under modern conditions special concessions applicable to a small section, of the correspondence passing through the post are extremely difficult to administer and lead to evasions.  With the present rates of pay there is ho reason why soldiers and their correspondents should be accorded a lower - and inuoed unremunerative-rate of postage any more than any other section of the population.    Soldiers at home at present pay the ordinary inland rate.  In any event the elaborate machinery prescribed by the section could not be observed without imposing a great deal of unnecessary labour upon Commanding Officers as well as upon the Post Office^Clause V abolishes the appeal to the treasury in cases of dispuoe as to whether a particular packet can pass at a particular rate and as to whether a publication can or cannot be admitted to the register for transmission as a newspaper. This appeal has in practice been very rarely used, and it is desired- both by the Treasury and the Post Office to get rid of it..   ,
