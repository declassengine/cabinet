IOTSTRIES AID MA1OTA0TDRES DgMji REPORT SOtlX On TgB gJgRAX, INDUSTRIAL POSITION28th June, 1920.The features of increasing demand and rising prices whioh have characterised most markets for raw materials and manufactured goods for the last year are now undergoing a ehange in some directions.)   Industry in general is beginning to entertain fears of the future.    The restriction of credits &quot;by banks and the realization that the abandonment of War Profits taxation proposals did not mean exemption for the need of finding large sums of money by other taxes such as the Excess Profits tax are in the main the two chief oauaes.   It is doubtful if either cause has resulted in actual discharge of workers but numerous instances can be cited of proposals to start new industries being postponed. For manufactured goods whioh are direotly and quickly consumed by the public there appears to be a considerable falling off of demandt whioh is no doubt partly seasonal.    This has been noticeable for some time in the case of boots and shoes, and now appears in respect of some textiles; but the direct effect of this is probably small compared with the indireot effects of a small drop in prices leading to (1) a general expectation of a further fall and so to a certain hesitancy in placing orders and (2) a belief in the probability of a general fall in prices of all commodities.   Trade buyers are more cautious and orders are being given more sparingly than formerly.    Credit restrictions are also .foroing merchants to limit their commitments.   The effeot of these ohanges on   -the manufacturing industries has not as yet been very consider-able, but the change is sufficiently marked to cause jgrave uneasiness in many trades.   Most of them have orders,&apos;however, which will keep them fully Occupied for some months.   The heavy trades suoh as iron and steel, engineering and general metal trades are still unable to meet the demand, and though orders are not&apos;being pressed on them there is no probability of their failing to sell all they can produce at present.The shortage of Iron and Steel is unquestionably  re-acting on other industries particularly those consuming large amounts of pig iron for makinfe oastings., and those requiring steel and iron plates in large quantities.    The difficulty of securing thin plates and tne high price of suoh plates when they can be delivered is without doubt helping to depress the Tin and Spelter markets,, ^he paper, pottery and glassware trades are still concerned mainly in finding means of increase ing production.&apos;   The real demand is unsatisfied and is likely  , to remain so until the plans for obtaining increased supplies of raw materials (especially coal), the training of fresh labour, and the installation of new machinery are.fully carried through.
foreign Competition is, generally speaking, still not serious in the home market, although it is beginning to be felt in certain trades, for instance The Eubber Tyre industry. United States;manufacturers are fully engaged in. satisfying their home demand and a series of labour and other troubles has considerably reduced their output.   The production of Continental countries is also too low to permit of a large export,Imports of raw materials continue to be on a large scale, and shipping conditions are now easier, time charter rates having&apos;definitely fallen to 20/- per ton.a number of industrial combinations have been notified; among these may be mentioned the formation of British Glues and Chemicals limited, a combination, with a capital of  2,000,000, of seven firms iranufacturing glue, gelatine, fats and fertilisers; the acquisition by Bolckow Vaughan and Company of a controlling interest in the Darlington Rolling Mills Company, the alliance between Crossley, Motorisj limited, and A*V*Rbe and Company,, aeroplane&quot; manufacturersj tM acquisition by Belgrave Standard tfyres limited, which Controls a number of tyre and cotton spinning worksv Of the Boldam Tyre Company; the amalgamation under the Durelco Company of a number of manufacturers of metallic filament lamps; the amalgamation of R* GraeSSer Limited, and Monsanto Chemical Works, manufacturers oi dyes and intermediates; and the formation of sand, Glass and Foundry Materials Amalgamation Limited, a combination \of a number of producers of &quot;building and refractory sands and bricks.   Reference to other combinations is made in the Section on Textiles,With reference to the agreement made early in the year between Baldwins and The Northumberland Shipping Company, the latter company have announced that on account of the decision to increase excess profits duty to 60fo it will be impossible for them to carry out their offer ( nade through Sperling and&apos; Company) to purchase the shares in Baldwins,,   The Shipping Company has issued a writ; against Baldwins for recession of the contract, and Baldwins have stated an action to enforce completion.Iron &amp; Steel.The scarcity of pig iron is still severe though some improvement in production is shown.   The output for May reached 738,000 tons, the highest monthly total since the Armistice, and nearly equal to the pre-war rate of output. The restriction on the export of coke has improved the supply to the furnaces but the railways are unable to deal fully with all the demands made upon them for transport of fuel and limestone, the latter particularly is serious in that many works are&apos; consuming almost all the linsestone they can obtain and thus are unable to build up absolutely necessary stocks against the wet season when the quarries are not worked.   T^b increase in the steel   capacity is making heavy demands on the pig iron- output even to the extent of absolutely diverting supplies^which once went to certain foundry trades, which will perforce be compelled to find new sources of supply*   The. National Light Castings Association of Scotland are so short of lion that they have placed orders for iron in America at -prices very much higher than those r quoted for Cleveland Iron.   Exports are at the rate of 60$ of the normal. v
The output of finished ancl semi-finis bed iron and steel is still short of the demand; general hesitation in. placing  &apos; orders has been partly felt in this trade but most firms have orders booked so far ahead as to make this fact of little importance and the present hign prices show no sign of weakening.   The steel tort put for May. reached 848,000 tons; this is an advance on the average monthly production before and during the, war &quot;mt the shortage of pig iron is probably &apos;   mainly responsible for the fact that it falls&apos; short of the      f estimated capacity of 12,000,000 tons per annum.    The general shortage of iron and steel products has caused many enquiries&apos; to be made abroad but the imports remain low, being about 40f0 of the normal imports.   Continental countries and America are having the same difficulty in supplying their own requirements that* are.Considerable exports are being made of special steels to the United States.Messrs, kuest Keen and Jettlefolds are making extensions at Dowlais costing  750,000, t6 include electric power plant  ; and ooke ov^na- and plant for making steel works and colliery : machinery.Tin Plates, j-    Orders are not being pressed so much as formerly, but the heavy arrears to be made up will occupy the mills for many! months.    Prices have falleh slightly in consequence of the fall in the price of tin but the limited output from the United States and the fact that the threatened competition from Canada and India Is yet some way ahead leaves South Wales in a strong position and little change of price or lack of orders are expected for some time.    The industry is no doubt handicapped by inability to obtain its full requirements of black sheets.Gralvanised Sheets, 1In this case also though orders have,not been coming in so fast, makers remain busy on old orders and prices are holding fast,   ThlJ Industry is doubtless like the tin plate industry not securing its full requirements of sheets and it would appear that at present prices the demand is cuite unlikely to reach the pre-war level of output for some considerable time,Non-fferrous Metals,The manufacturing trades have remained very busy, an      j increase in export business having helped towards com-compensating for any slackening in the home demands.   The slow development of the house building programme has deferred j the boom in house fittings that was expected but the, jmanufacturing branches of the trade are fully occupied with orders now coming in, and in some cases complaint is made as to the shortage of labour.   (The,recent increases in wages have done something to stop the movement of labour from the brass trade to the other metal trades.
Praatioally all the more Important non-ferrous metals are being quoted at prices below the cost of production in the country of origin and to this unsatisfactory oondition\ several causes have contributed.   Soon after the armistice the  i general belief that reconstruction would give rise to an enormous demand for all non- ferrous metals caused a very large ; amount of speculative buying to take place.   This gambling grew in intensity with the result that prices were forced up to excessive levels - particularly in the oase of Tin which i early in the year went to over  40C  per ton, J!he expected       4 demand did not materialize - prices ,srere too high and in .?jparticular Germannrefrained from buying - quotations then began to drop and7 when the banks grew mere stringent in Jgiving oredits the speculators were compelled to realize with    ) the result that prioes moved rapidly downwards    even to figures^ quite unremunerative to the producer.   Tin for instance is        \ fluctuates between  240 -  260 per ton.   The disordered state of international exchange, restrictions by the French Government on sending remittances from Pranoe and inability      i to get full supplies of sheets for tinning and galvanizing have all helped in depressing metal prioes.    Improvements        j in prices are not expected before the autumn and if in the        I mean time production falls off to any great extent there will    1 probably be a general shortage during next year.    The low    .    j prioe of tin has resulted in the closing down of several of the Oornish tin mines.    Lead and zinc mining in this oountry    I has decreased during the last few years and a further deorease   I is probable unless metal prioes soon rise to the figures of the early part of the year.    The $in Smelting Industry is maintaining its position imports of ore being slightly better than before the war.   Two more zinc smelters have recently closed but one is expected to reopen when the difficulties of labour have been definitely surmounted.    At the time wlien no zino smelters are operating remuneratively a seotion of workers pat in a demand for increased wages because the worte in question can operate more economically than can older wo^jes, New that the furnaces have been allowed to go cold it is un^ likely that they will be restarted until a perfectly definite i understanding has been reached.    Shortage of copper ore is causing difficulty to copper smelters but the reason given for closing one smelter - the last rise in the price of coal     ( can scarcely be regarded as valid and the real cause is probably to be found in the general inadequacy of the plant and direction.1Engineer inff.A strike of steam service men has interfered with the out- i put of many of the works in the liidlands and supply is still      ,j short of demand in most branches.     .0rders already reoeived will ensure full business for some months although new orders are not being placed freely.The etfctrieal trade is steadily expanding and a good deal of confidence is expressed in the future of the British &apos; Blectrioal Industry,   A nunber of orders for generating and transmission plant have been reoeived from the 3ast and the cable makers have exceptionally heavy business on hand, they are carrying on alarge export trade and certain consumers in this country are complaining of that supply. :* (there is no substantial slackening in the shipbuilding trade through lack of orders for ships, but the shortage of steel has resulted in short tine being worked in some cases and there is a greater tendency to talk of the coming slump., &apos; It appears as yet however, that this is not a matter of the immediate future.
Leather *continuance of the lack of orders in the boot and shoe trade, lias continued to affect the whole leather industry. Some boot factories have, now accumulated so much stock that short time is being worked.   Retailers appear to be holding up orders in expectation of a fall in prices and the rise in the Continental exchange- has not yet produoedi any greatly increased demand from Europe..    The demand from Continental markets con-tinues small except for the highest grades, and it is thought that Australia, S* Africa and India will jnfuture themselves supply the main part of their&apos; requirements for boots.    The leather market has been very quiet and many tanners have re-duced their^ output of hides by as much as one-half on the ground that cost of production will not allow them to stimulate demand by large reductions in prices.    Hide values decreased rapidly during May but latterly there has been a slight recovery indicating probably some increase in confidence in the trade.Paper. .... &apos; ..,Although the general tendency towards, the w eakening&quot; of prices and the reduction of volume of business has perhaps caused some buyers to delay placing their, orders, the effect on the paper trade has been negligible; the mills are already booked far ahead and there is still a real demand so far exceed-ing the &quot;supply that prioes are holding firm or continuing to rise.    The increase in the consumption of paper is shown by the fact that though imports are now on the pro-war scale and pro-duct ion in this country is believed to have increased there is still a real shortage in many classes of paper.    Makers of English millboard are complaining that, as a result of past war conditions and experience and present prices this trade has been largely lost to ihe producers of strawboard.The pulp position is unchanged.     Imports have recently been very heavy, the only item in which there is any scarcity being mechanioal pulp, used for newsprint,    The fall In the export trade is mainly due to the shortage of newsprint,Glassware.Considerable progress is being made especially by works producing machine made bottles and jars.    Some difficulty is&apos;, however being met with the men in arranging shifts to enable the machines to work at full capacity.    The shortage In window glasc and in plate-glass particularly the thin qualities is still serious.Chemicals *The demand for heavy chemicals continues steady, and in view of the short supply of many of the more important products, and the heavy sales by makers over a long period ahead, prices in most cases shew no signs of falling.      In some districts trade has &quot;been hampered by scarcity of chemicals.The demand for soda ash and crystals continues In excess of available supplies and though the arrival of considerable quantities!of soda compounds from America Is reported, only a few spot parcels appear to be available.    American c.i.f. prices are some 30/- per ton higher than British quotationsBb avy chemicals continue to boh demand for export.to all the important foreign markets.Methyl alcohol Is In very short.supply. . A very consider-Itble decrease in production is reported in America where the price of methyl alcohol has almost doubled in the last three months. .
This is serious particularly to the dye making industry.   The directors of the Chilworth Gunpowder Factory have notified thoir employees that the company is to go into voluntary liquidation because of the do or eased demand for gunpowder, of increased taxation and of competition from America and Belgium.It Is reported that  membership of the new Chemical and Dyestuffs traders Association at Manchester is satisfactory. An Office will shortly be opened in London.The British Sulphate of Ammonia Federation has beenregis-tered; the main, condition of membership being that the candidate produces or r epres e nts iirkerests whioh pr educe ab out 10,000 t ons of ammonium sulphate.The completion of a large new plant for formic acid ia reported from Bradford, and the manufacturers are now able to supply in bulk this acid which is replacing to some extent oxalio. lactic and acetic acids.Ooal Tar Products scad Intermediates and Dyes.High prices continue to rule for coal tar products.    A ... strong demand for Naphthalene has been experienced from America and is being met as far as home trade permits at a price of from  45 -  50 per ten for refined, qualities.    A considerable export trade is being dene in Cresylic acid and prepared coal tar dis-infeotants and1 sheep dips.     It may be of interest to note that &apos; whereas Japanese demands a short time ago sustained the home market for Carbolic Acid Crystals, Crystals are now being offered to British merchants at &quot;llfd. per lb, f.o,b. Japan., The position of many of the implant intermediates is 8tD\. difficult, but alight decreases in the price-of bsta-ria^ptrtbol:, paranltraniline and dtoethylaniline have be$n noticeable.    It is reported this week that British Dyestuffs Corporation are ab^e once again to make deliveries of the two first named produots, though substantial quantities of beta naphthol are being supplied from America.Aniline oil is reported to be a little easier to procure,.. and it has been possible to allow the. export of small quantities of aniline salt to the Dominions,It may be of interest to notd the advent of Messrs. Brotherton-s Metachrone Black belonging to a class of colours which give fast shades to wool in a single dye bath,    This firm has also placed a full range of hydro-sulphites on the market./p7^?J?ke Association of Graessers - the Tar distillers of ftukaa-on: North &quot;Wales with the Monsanto Chemical Company of America has Already been noted.      As a result of a decision by the American United Drug Company to open retail shops in this country a new company has been registered under the title &quot;LIggetts International Limited&quot; to combine the interests of the American group and of Boots Pure Drug Company as well as of certain other companies in this country and in Canada.It is reported^that the oapital of the new company ia  10,000,000.
Oils,There appears to be continued uncertainty in tho oil ma? kets * Buyers are in many cases holding back in anticipation of an early slump in values, while others think that the present high prices will be maintained at least until the end of the year.    As a result Of tiftis uncertainty and probably also of th  policy adopt-ed in various countries of restriction of credits by banks, markets on the whole appear to to inactive with a corroesponding tendency to a decline in prices.Seed oils, The May import returns, while showing in some cases an &apos; Increase      value of oil qoed Imports, shew a decrease on the quantity imported during the correspondihg period of last year. Puring the first five,months of this year we received only about half the amount of cotton seed suitable for making dftible oil that arrived during the same period of 1919 when the demands of the margarine industry were not a3 grdit.    The amount received this year is very considerably &quot;b^low the pre-war rfite of import-ation.There has, however, been a consider ab 10 increase in the May arrivals of linseed as compared with the previous months of the year, and imports from the Argentine are now almost th$ same as in 1913.   A heavy fall has been noticeable In the receipt of Indian Linseed, and imports of Rape seed and soya bean are still much below the pre-war import.The Mineral Oil market is firm with indications of yet higher prices At the first annual meeting of Scottish Oils Limited the Chairman reported that economies In Working had resulted from the amalga-mation of the Shale Companies and the Anglo-Persia Oil Company. This and the higher price of oil products had enabled the Company to grant the demand of the men for a seven hours day and had also left a fair- margin of profit.    The refineries are being worked to their fullest capacity as imported oils are now being treated.The Tobacco Trade is passing through a period of depression and those associated with the trade regard over capitalization as the fundamental cause and the last increase in tobacco duties as the immediate cause.      It is stated that sales of high grade tobaccos and cigarettes are seriously diminished but that common qualities are scarcely affected.    The recent announcement that Taddys are to close permanently as a result of demands for increased wages is regarded as part only of the story.    The makers of Do Reszkt oirgarettes recently gave their workers a compulsory 3 weeks holi-day.    Outside the Combine, The Ardath Tobacco Company is looked upon as having the best trade.Before the war it is probable even that many firms were over capitalized but when the war came, government orders enabled the trade to make good prof its and even to pay back arrears of dividends.     Many of those financing the industry foresaw at the time of the Armistice that a period of depression would follow and to make the most they could out of.the public, further shares were offered and on the strength of war balance sheets, and on account of the common knowledge that tfre combine was doing well these shares were eagep^y accepted,    It is now believed that the present depression Is but the beginning of a positive &quot;slump&quot;.
ira:ra ihpustribs.Since the date of the last report, the position of the loading textile industries has completely changed. Raw materials, for example Cotton, Wool and.Silk, hare dropped considerably in&apos;price.   The position with regard to pieoe goods* however, is peculiar as they&apos; oan be bought -in the shops at lower prioes than those at widen they core &quot;being actually manufactured to-aay,   This is explained &quot;by the faot that orders were plaoea so far ahead that the material being manufactured to-day was ordered some months ago when raw materials were very high in pricet whereas the goods being sold to**aay were largely made &quot;      &apos; months ago and ordered when raw materials were cheaper * Owing to the financial situation., chiefly the restriction of credits by banks in this and most foreign anuatries,  . the merchants are unable to finance orders which they teW have placed and heavy cancellations are &quot;being received from the United States, Japan, Canada, etc  Another factor is that the first rush of textile orders after the world shortage due to the war appears to hare been satisfied ana buyers are now holding off, only buying sufficient to meet urgent demands, in the hope that prioes will faXU  Textile Industries in general are fostering export trade and it is interesting to note that for the first 5 months of this year the exoess of exports over imports/of all textile materials, including raw and manufactured, was Just over  39,000,000*   Several amalgamations etc. have-taken place recently as noted &quot;below x**Ootton &apos; - *\ *laburnum Spinning Company (1920) ltd. ,Atherton, to take over the unaertakinge and all or any of the assets and liabilities of the Laburnum Spinning Oompany, ana&quot;the Walkden Spinning&apos;and Manufacturing Oompany.

Mitohelson &amp; Co.&apos;, itd.,COTTON.The chief feature of the past few weeks has been the fall in price of Egyptian Cot ton, F.G.F. Sakellaridis, under Government control was 27.30d. per lb. in January 1919; by the end of December 1919 it had risen to 54d.; under a free market it gradually rose and touched 92.50d. at March l8tfc 1920, since when it has dropped to 70d. which was a quotation at June 16th.    The demand for yarns and piece goods during the last few weeks has fallen off considerably. Most firms, however, being booked many months ahead, have been able to keep going at full time but the orders now coming, In are small.    Although the market is dull there is no sign of prioes falling substantially although there is a decided downward tendency.The International Cotton Congress was held at Zurich from June 9th to Juno 11th.    This was the first congress held since the outbreak of war.    The most important discussions were on Hie question of increasing the worlds cotton supply, high density baling, and the effect of fluctuation In rates of exchange on International trade.WOOL,  I; :Ha?/ Wool,    The 13th series of London sales closed on June 11th and the fall in values was very marked.   The decline since March is more noticeable, however,&quot;and the following comparison of prices of wool on a clean, scoured 4 basis is of interest.    The highest point in wool prices was touched in March.

Prioes. However 3 still remain firm at a high level and it is thought by soma people that the fall in the price of wool will be countered by increased labour costs., Mill operatives in tho West Riding received advances of 10$ on tots 1st and a demand has,been put in for a further 40$ increase as from August 1st.   Opal is also dearer so there seems little prospect of an early reduction in the prioe of piece gooas*Ready-made 01othing.   There is a aistinot lull in the clothing trade.   Some manufacturers are fairly busy wording on orders booked some time ego;, &quot;but others are having a slack time, as fresh orders are not oomlng in very walli   The rates of exchange with European countries are given as a reason why export orders are falling off. end the high price of materials is also res-ponsible.   The tendency seems to be for customers to hold off buying until compelled to do so.Great interest is being taken in.the Standard Clothing . Scheme initiated by the Board of Trade.   Cloth manufacturers agreed to deliver 500,000 yards of cloth from September to December nert5 and clothiers have agreed to manufacture the suits..   Foreign trade delegations at present in this country &amp;re evincing great interest in the Scheme, particularly the American,.

Goods on order ore being held up by many customers, the reason given being that they are over-stocked and there is a small demand from the public.   Prospects for-the future are very doubtful for the home trade and-for the foreign trade appear gloomy*   Export to the Continent has almost ceased owing to the high rates of exchange; and to China and Japan owing to cheaper labour in these countries.   Labour demands are making things &quot;very unsett? as it is impossible to glvo fixed quotations, increased rates being rsked for frequently whereas the output per head is much below pre-war standards.Jinen. The linen market is sluggish.   Several hundred&quot;Ions of Russian flax have been delivered in Dundee lately hut spinners are not inclined to pay the price asked for, Z4 0 per tor.   Is flax prices have been inflated recently the Hetel Bank will shortly.sell by auotion a large quantity of fiox in order to aso-ertoin the present real market value. There has been a marked  aXIing off in enquiries from the &quot;United States lately.   This appears, to be due to the high price rrling for linen fahxics.   Little-is doing in the home market.   Owing to the continued shortage of flax it is anticipated that the production of  Lax goods may have to ho considerably reduced during &apos;.tlie next few months * It is hoped,, however,&apos; that hy using substitutes a great pro-portion of the machinery will be kept running and much un-employment will be thereby avoided.LAC&amp; EIiBBOIDERt ETC     *Orders are not flowing in very well and most branches of the trade appear to be very quiet.   This is duo to the high prices oonseguent on, the ahnormally high cost of yarns and increased wages.   The plain net section is on strike haying demanded a 44-4xcur week&apos;and 4=0 per cent increase of w&amp;ges with a  4 a week %iji1jtoi*,  I&amp;inufactaers regard the situation with    equanimity.&apos;, as, thoy have largo stocks and the demand is  oor at present.

The Prenob prohibition against the importation of manufactured silks into France is operating seriously against the British makers of mourning crepe - almost the only English made silk fabric imported into France.    Mills in Great yarmouth,Uorwioh, Braintree, Halstead and Jrome are working on short time or are closing, and if the decree is enforced the industry will be threatened  with oxtinotiCn.    It is hoped however that the decree will be so modified as to enable the trade to continue.QARPBTS.Although there has been a drop in the various; classes of raw materials, it has net made it-self felt in the price of yams, and considerable pressure is needed to obtain delivery of these.    Some difficulty is also being experienced in Obtaining new machinery and renewals.    Negotiations are in progress for an advance of wages owing to the increase in the cost of living.    Prices of carpets have remained unchanged since the date of the last report, and orders are still arriving in fairly satisfactory quantities.JtKEB.This industry has been very depressed for some few weeks past.    Raw jute has fallen slightly in price.    Orders for yarns and hessians are not coming in very well owing to the amount of cheaper Calcutta goods on offer.    lair quantities of the wider classes of hesaians appear to be on order but very little narrow.
