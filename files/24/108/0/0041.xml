[To be substituted for the bill previously circulated.]Dominion of Ireland Bill.  [h.l.]The intention of this Bill is to grant a Constitution to Ireland enabling that country to attain the position of a self-governing Dominion of the Crown, and to have the same freedom, save for a few exceptions, in the management of internal affairs as the other self-governing Dominions of the Empire.The Constitution of the Dominion is to be framed by the Irish people themselves. It is proposed that as soon as this Act is passed the Irish Constituent Assembly shall be summoned. This Assembly is to be composed of elected representatives from all parts of Ireland, elected according to the schedule to this Bill, which schedule adopts the system of proportional representation.The Assembly is to manage its own procedure, and its duty is to frame a Constitution for the Dominion of Ireland.The Constitution which may be devised by the Assembly is only limited as follows: The supreme executive or legislative power remains vested in His Majesty, acting through the Lord Lieutenant.In addition, the following matters are outside the scope of the new Constitution: 1. The Crown.2. The making of peace and war. 3. The Navy, Army and Air Eorce. &apos;4. Treaties, except commercial treaties.As regards the forces of the Crown, only those which are necessary to be in Ireland for the defence of that country from foreign powers are to remain in Ireland. The remainder are to be withdrawn.Besides that, the Irish Government will have power to raise a territorial force for employment in Ireland which will not, except with the consent of Ireland, be under the control of the British War Office.MEMORANDUM.(88)i-A
As soon as the&apos; Assembly has framed the Constitution of the Dominion and has reported, the Assembly comes to an end, and within a year the new Constitution for Ireland is to be set up.There is a clause enabling the Ulster counties to vote themselves out of the new Constitution, with provision for taking a fresh vote after an interval of five years so long as those parts remain outside the Constitution.
