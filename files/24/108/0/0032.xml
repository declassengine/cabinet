General. Nil.Part IT.-Departmental.The Industrial Training, of Disabled Men.For the first time the number of disabled men on the Ministry V waiting list is less than the number of men actually receiving training, though the difference between the totals is small. On the 23rd June there were 24,285 men in training and 23,626 awaiting training. * This result is in part due to the examination of the waiting lists in order to remove candidates who no longer require training, or who cannot benefit by it. But it is due also to an increase, steady, if perhaps still rather slow, in the number of men in training. The total on the 23rd June exceeded that in the beginning of April by over 3,000. Allowance must of course be made for the fact that men are now com-completing their training in considerable numbers. Since the 1st August, 1919, 11,781 men trained by the Department have completed their courses, the number during the week ending the 23rd June being 312. As, by the end of July, 1919, the Ministry of Pensions had trained a little less, than 11,000 men, the Government have already been responsible for the complete industrial training of nearly 23,000 men.* The number of men awaiting training in the middle of April was approximately 27,000. (C 2016)   150   6/20  H&amp;S 2L
These results, if not everything that could be desired, are none the less very satis-factory. It is necessary to remember that, quite apart from the serious difficulties still encountered in equipping the training centres and instructional factories, the department have in all cases to watch carefully the prospects of absorption in the particular trades in which training is given, and in view of the men&apos;s &quot;future, have to be guided to a large extent in this matter by the opinion of the National Trade Advisory Committees and the Local Technical Advisory Committees. It is possible that excessive caution may at times&apos; be shown by some of these bodies, but this had to be overcome rather than disregarded. Undue haste on the part of the Department would only retard rather than promote the reinstatement in industry of the disabled.The prospects for the future depend on the development of the Government Instruc-tional Factories. There are many areas in which it will be practically impossible to make further progress until the completion of the factories now in course of adaptation and equipment. In the Yorkshire area, for example, practically every training place available has been filled for some time. Over half the instructional factories acquired, however, are already in full or partial operation, with upward of 4,000 men in training, more by a quarter than was the case early in April, and four times the number in training in instructional factories in the middle of October last. During the next three months, however, it is believed that nearly all the remaining instructional factories will be brought at any rate into partial operation. In Yorkshire two new factories have started this month; a third should be opened in about a week&apos;s time, and a fourth in July.It may not be without interest to note a few of the steps that are being taken to promote the welfare of the men in training at these factories. The institution of periodical medical inspection of the trainees is now under discussion. Some such step would appear desirable as a safeguard against the risk of occasional breakdown in the case of disabled men. The question of accommodation, which has inevitably risen in consequence of the concentration of men for training at the factories, is being solved by the development of hostels. For these the Ministry is in part directly responsible, while in other cases out-side societies are carrying them on. The Ministry at present is directly responsible for carrying on nine individual hostels, a group of hostels at Birtley and eight canteens. Some 30 hostels managed by voluntary associations also provide housing for men in training, but the Ministry has not accepted any responsibility in these cases. In some cases arrangements are being made to accommodate men in the instructional factories about to be opened, while a few additional independent hostels are also being organised. Steps have been taken, in consequence of offers to supply books from the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John, to institute libraries for the use of men in training in all the centres administered by the Ministry.A development of some interest, which has been especially noticeable during the last few months, has been the production of schemes for training ex-Service men as elementary school teachers. The first step in this direction was taken some time ago at Sarisbury Court in conjunction with the Board of Education. It was intended to train suitable ex-Service men for general elementary school work, with a special bias, however, towards handicraft work. With this object a training college has been set up, providing openings for 100 students and offering a training course of two years, comprising 75 weeks&apos; actual instruction. Work will commence in the immediate future. The number of applications for training of this description has very considerably exceeded expectation. Investigations are being made as to the possibility of extending the training college at Sarisbury Court to accommodate 150 students, and similar schemes which have been suggested at Birming-ham and Birtley are also under active consideration. In view of the very general shortage of teachers, the prospects of employment are good, while the teaching profession will not suffer by the addition of members who have entered it after experiences widely different from those given in the course of conventional scholastic training.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press. Topics of Discussion.The return of Messrs. Shaw and Turner from Russia bearing the interim Report of the Labour delegation and the manifesto from Lenin, which were dealt with in this Report last week, page 270, provide ample material for long articles in all the papers reviewed. The resolution of the executive of the N.U.R. on the question of sympathetic strikes*, and the general question of sympathetic and direct action are the subject of important articles in the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Cotton Factory Times.&quot;   Some comments* See below, page 285.
on the Labour Party annual conference appear. There are the usual small criticisms of Government policy, principally directed against the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill and the decision of the Cabinet not to tax war-time increases of wealth. There is, however, nothing new in this criticism, and it has not been thought necessary to detail it at length. ,Russia.The comments on Lenin&apos;s letter are more illuminating than those on the interim Report of the Labour delegation. If Lenin intended his letter to be a source of encourage-ment to his supporters in this country, it may be judged that he will be gravely dis-appointed. The letter is, indeed, printed in full in the &apos; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and in &apos; The Call,&quot; but it is not given very great prominence in their comments and articles.* The more moderate writers, who have never had any affection for Lenin, take it as proof of the correctness of their former attitude. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; regards the letter as extraordinary, and states that had not its authenticity been vouched for by Messrs. Turner and Shaw, he would have been strongly inclined to regard it as the concoction of some anti-Bolshevist agency. The letter reminds &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; For-ward,&quot; of the effort of a Scottish Calvinist minister of the eighteenth century. Mr. H. W. Lee, in &quot; Justice,&quot; thinks that the letter admirably reveals the impossibilist nature of Lenin&apos;s outlook. &quot; He has graduated in the theoretical socialist university of Zurich and Geneva instead of having learned from the living school of actual human experience.&quot; The wide publicity which the manifesto has received in the daily press would appear rather to have disconcerted the more extreme papers and not to have been anticipated by Messrs. Shaw and Turner themselves. The replies which the letter has received have given an opportunity for some of the papers to avoid dealing with the letter directly. &quot; The Call,&quot; for example, makes an attack upon Mr. Clynes&apos; article on the letter which appeared in the &quot; Daily News,&quot; and thus avoids giving any particular comments upon the document itself. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; refuses to treat the letter seriously, makes an imaginative com-parison between Lenin and the Secretary of State for War and the Air, and hopes that the letter will have a healthy effect on anti-Bolshevists by changing &quot; their morbid and unreasonable terror into a more healthy contempt.&quot; The most curious thing is that the &quot; Nation &quot; attempts a philosophical defence&apos; of Lenin&apos;s letter. &quot; Society has to defend itself against a charge of sabotage on an infinitely greater scale than the Red Terror.&quot;The interim report of the Labour delegation meets with general approval, even in papers so far apart as the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and &quot; The Call.&quot; The only note of criticism is sounded by the &quot; Workers Dreadnought,&quot; which describes the report as an arid document, and which is gratified at the way in which Lenin has slighted the Labour delegation in his letter. It may be noted that this paper also contains details of a scheme for the formation of &quot; household Soviets &quot; in this country, and has even gone to the trouble of using the census returns as the basis of the scheme. Misv Sylvia Pankhurst believes that her idea of household Soviets is an original and important addition to the theory of Soviet Government.Hungary.The evidence is accumulating that the action of the International Federation of Trade Unions in imposing a boycott on Hungary has not been approved in British Labour circles. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; repeats the argument against it that the whole population of Hungary will suffer from this measure. He points out that the report of the Labour dele-gation to Hungary asks that the British Government and the Supreme Allied Council should take measures to redress the grievances of the Hungarian socialists. He argues that the British Trade Union movement cannot at the fame time put the matter into the hands of diplomacy and take direct action on their own account. He rather criti-cises the policy suggested by the delegation and asks that steps are actually to be taken and how far is the Trades Union Congress likely to back up any action of the Government. Would it, for instance, support the sending of soldiers to Hungary independently of the Supreme Allied Council ?Ireland.The &quot; Socialist &quot; has a permanent interest in the relations between the British Labour movement and Ireland.  It has two fears with regard to Ireland.  Firstly, that the Irish* &quot; The Call &quot; may have been annoyed by the references to Miss Pankhurst, and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; by the fact that the letter was addressed.to &quot; The Call.&quot;(C 2016) 2 L 2
Socialist movement may impair its efficiency by identifying itself too closely with Sinn Fein, which is regarded as a bourgeois movement; secondly, that the Irish proletariat may be led away by too great a faith in the British Labour movement and Labour leaders from an independent pursuit of the social revolution in Ireland. In view of the way in which the National Union of Railway men has become implicated in the North Wall strike, the latter fear is now predominant. Hence, we have&apos;a vicious attack on the leaders of the N.U.R. &quot; Thomas and Cramp have contemplated and attempted an act of betrayal unparalleled even in the black pages of Trade Union leadership in Great Britain.&quot; The inevitable result, in this paper&apos;s opinion, must be a breakaway of Irish Labour from British Labour. The &quot; Socialist &quot; believes that a repudiation of British leaders by Irish rank and file may be a herald of the prelude to the revolution.Sympathetic Action.An important article in the &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the whole question of sym-pathetic action, based upon the resolution of the N.U.R. which is dealt with on page 284. below. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; points out that the question of sympathetic action in connection with trade disputes is scarcely less important than the question of industrial action for political purposes. If the policy of sympathetic action were systematically adopted, it is doubtful whether the ordinary working of industry could continue at all. The railwaymen have taken the only possible course in deciding that they cannot embark upon such action on their own initiative and their own resources. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that the general adoption of a policy of sympathetic action can be entertained only by those who aim definitely and deliberately at an early and catastrophic revolution : and, it is thought, that the vast majority of workers entertain no such object. It is pointed out, however, that in each isolated case such action may have an irresistible appeal to the ordinary worker and that there are comparatively few persons sufficiently logical to apply to all cases a theoretical objection to sympathetic or political strikes. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; looks for the limitation of such action not so much to faith in the sanctity of parliamentary institutions, but rather to the practical circumstances which govern the use of all such weapons. &quot; The magnitude of the weapon is likely to restrict its use in practice and to make those who decide to invoke it more anxious for compromise than they would otherwise be. For the present it will remain rather a threat in the background than an actuality. But the Government must exhibit common sense in facing the problems which confront it, or else a situation may develop in which Labour will be irresistibly tempted to employ this last weapon in a good cause.&quot;The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; concentrates upon the question of industrial action for political purposes. The opinion is expressed that a general strike on the Irish question would inevitably split the trade union movement. It is regretted that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; can find no better outlet for its energies than publishing the gospel of direct action on every question of the day. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; does not hesitate to say that it is impossible for any ballot of the whole of the workers, by however large a majority the particular question at issue may be carried, to produce anything like unity in the resulting action. In this connection it is interesting to note that the &quot; Railway Review &quot; contains a further article criticising the recent conduct of the &quot; Daily Herald.&apos;&apos; &quot; Our paper is more capable of reflecting the opinion of the rank and file than the writers whose knowledge of theory may be profound, but whose experience does not extend to practical trade union administration.&quot; &quot; Roy Rob,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; also expresses the fear that the Labour and Socialist Movement is likely to get into, great difficulties from too free acceptance of the policy of direct industrial action for political purposes &quot; a policy doubtful at all times and of rare application at best.&quot; The Trade Union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; endorses the attitude of the N.U.R.The Labour Party Conference.The comments upon the Labour Party are few. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; do not expect any sensational developments. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, expresses surprise that no steps have been taken to raise the issue of mines nationalisation at this conference. Mr. W. H. Ryde, in &quot; The Call,&quot; considers the Agenda of the Conference, and gives a full list of the British Socialist Party amendments. He fears that the Conference will be the scene of a severe struggle between the left and right wings of the Labour Movement.
Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the week with regard to the industrial situation, perhaps the most important strike in progress was that of the marine wireless operators,&apos; which was complicated by questions of sympathetic action on the part of the seamen&apos;s trade unions, and by questions of administrative action which affected the Board of Trade. An agreement, however, was reached on the 24th, as the result of a conference arranged by the Ministry between the London and District Association of Engineering Employers acting on behalf of the Marconi Company and the Wireless Operators, providing for immediate resumption of work, no victimisation and negotiations on the wage question. It is probable that the Seafarers Joint Council will seek an interview with the Board of Trade on the question of ships proceeding to sea without wireless operators.The disputes actually in progress have, however, been overshadowed by the threatened disputes in the Printing Trade and Gas Industry. In both these cases stoppages at the end of this week have been avoided by a suspension for one week of the notices to cease work. With regard to the threatened stoppage in the Printing Trade, the Typographical Association have agreed, on the assurance that a conference will be held on request after the new Rent Restriction Act becomes operative, to consult their mem-bers on the offer of the 10s. increase and to raise the embargo on overtime. All the other unions in the trade had already accepted the offer of the employers. The unions concerned in the Gasworkers dispute have appointed a Negotiating Committee to meet the employers next week for the purpose of further discussion. Agricultural labourers in Essex and bank clerks in Scotland are threatening to strike at the end of this week.The annual conference of the Labour Party which opened at Scarborough on the 22nd inst. is also overshadowed by the near approach of the annual conferences of the M.F.G.B. and the N.U.R., which will meet in the week commencing the 4th July, and the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress which will he held on the 13th July. These three meetings will have to take decisions on policy of the greatest importance, and in com-parison with their decisions the expressions of opinion of the Labour Party Conference (though of unusual interest) will bear somewhat the character of pious resolutions.The progress through Parliament of the various legislative proposals affecting labour, of which there are many, now. under consideration, is scarcely receiving proper attention, and indicates a disposition on the part of organised labour to look more to industrial action than parliamentary effort as a means of redressing grievances.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces policies current at the week ended the 11th June, 1920, was 188,770 (187,583 lodged by men and 1,187 by women). The previous week there were 193,383 policies current, 192,119 lodged by men and 1,364 by women.65,119 unemployment books (44,919 lodged by males and 20,200 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 11th June, 1920, a decrease of 2,441 since the 4th June. At the latter date 46,588 books were lodged by males and 20,972 by females (a total of 67,560).The total live register at all Employment Exchanges at the week ended the 11th June was 257,402 men, 46,777 women, and 20,964 juveniles compared with 265,276 men, 45,669 women, and 20,952 juveniles a week&quot; ago (4th June) and 273,772 men, 48,529 women and 23,076 juveniles a month ago.Ireland, Russia and Hungary.The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met on the 16th and 17th ist . in order to consider the various appeals, mainly from the Triple Alliance, that a special Congress should be convened in order that the trade union movement as a whole may define its attitude towards the production and handling of munitions of war for use in Ireland and against Russia. It was decided to accede to the requests and to summon a special Congress for the 13th July. The meeting of the Congress will therefore take place immediately after the annual conference of the N.U.R. and M.F.G.B. The whole of the Labour Party delegation will have returned from Russia by that time, and the Congress should have before it their final report. The Congress may also determine the attitude of the English trade union movement towards the boycott ordered by the Inter-national Federation of Trade Unions against Hungary.The Conference of Irish branches of the N.U.R. at Bristol is dealt with below. The position at North Wall, Dublin, remains unchanged, and in the rest of the South and(B 2016) 2 L 3
West of Ireland an extension of the movement against conveying war materials has taken place. Action is now being taken not only against materiel but also against personnel. The Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party-is issuing widespread appeals for funds with which to support the railwaymen on strike, and the extensive nature of their appeal does not indicate that funds have been readily forthcoming. The statement by the Prime Minister to the N.U.R. deputation that the Government proposed to adhere to the policy already adopted at North Wall appears to have been received in trade union circles in Dublin as a threat of a general lockout. The Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party have issued a manifesto warning Irish workmen not to be led into the trap laid for them by the Government, nor to take any measures towards a general strike. They must strictly conform to their original purpose of boycotting materials of war and troops, but must take individual, not mass, action; each man must wait for a personal dismissal before leaving work.With regard to the relations between the Labour movement and the Soviet Govern-ment of Russia, there are two developments to report. The Central Executive of the All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions proposes to send a fraternal delegation of enquiry to this country; a general invitation has also been issued to Western European Labour organisations to attend the forthcoming Congress of the 3rd International at Moscow in July.There does not appear to have been any attempt to put the International Federation of Trade Unions&apos; boycott on Hungary into operation in this country and a similar state of affairs would appear to exist in France, Holland and in the Scandinavian countries. The boycott is, however, being generally observed in Austria.The Cost of Living.The special committee of inquiry, representative of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative movement, which also contains representatives of the more important federations of Trade Unions, appointed to investigate the increased cost of living and to make recommendations for its reduc-tion, met on the 17th inst.A Sub-Committee was appointed to work out detailed plans for investigation consisting , of:--Messrs. Frank Hodges (Miners&apos; Federatiqn); J. Ramsay Macdonald (Labour Party); E. L. Poulton (Secretary, Boot and Shoe Operatives); F. Bramley (Parliamentary Com-mittee); with a representative of the Co-operative movement, not yet appointed. The Sub-Committee subsequently met and decided to institute special inquiries on the subjects of food, clothing, coal, transport; housing, and raw materials. In relation to the above subjects they have decided to investigate the effect on prices of the following factors :--(1) Taxation. (2) Scarcity, natural and artificial. (3) Transport disorganisation. (4) Wages and industrial unrest. (5) Financial operations other than currency. (6) Standard and rates of exchange, currency, floating debt, &amp;c. (7) Government control and its effects.The Committee have decided to invite witnesses who are recognised authorities, to give evidence, and have also decided to invite Mr. Arthur Greenwood, formerly attached to the Ministry of Reconstruction, to become secretary of the Committee.Labour Party Annual Conference.The annual conference of the Labour Party opened in Scarborough on the 22nd inst. On the Tuesday the report of the executive was adopted, which included the pro-posal to increase the subscription of the affiliated unions from 2d. per member per annum to Zd. per member per annum. On the Wednesday the report of the Parlia-mentary Committee was approved, and a long resolution outlining the policy of the party in foreign affairs was adopted. The resolution provides for the views contained in it being laid before the Prime Minister by a deputation representing the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. and the executive&apos;of the Labour Party. A full account of the proceedings of the conference will be given in this report next week.Four points of interest, however, have already transpired. There is an absence of reference to, and enthusiasm about, the question of mines nationalisation, which was so prominent a topic in labour discussions last year.. The Irish question is tending to over-shadow such other questions as British policy towards Russia, in India and in Egypt. The left wing opposition to the executive in this conference is being made by the British Socialist Party, and the I.L.P. leaders are working together well with the trade union leaders.The British Socialist Party amendment to the foreign affairs resolution that in addi-tion to the deputation to the Prime Minister on foreign affairs, a national labour conference
should be immediately summoned in order to organise a general strike &quot; to put an end once and for all to the open and covert participation of the British Government in attacks on the Soviet Republic,&quot; received very little support. Mr. Robert Smillie deprecated the addendum, and declared that the deputation should take place first and that further action should depend on its results. The rejection of the addendum must not, therefore, betaken to mean that the reception by the Prime Minister of the deputation will end the matter. There is a searching for a method of effective action, and the moderation at this moment of such leaders as Mr. Smillie and Mr. Bevin will strengthen their position should, the result of the deputation prove unsatisfactory and a call for further action be made.Hours of Employment Bill.The Minister met the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Con-ference on the 17th inst., and communicated to them the text of the Hours of Employment Bill which it is proposed to introduce into the House of Commons at an early date. The Provisional Joint Committee will meet on the 28th inst., further to consider the draft Bill.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill.A conference convened by the Labour Housing Association was held at the Essex Hall, London, on the 19th inst., at which a resolution was passed roundly condemning Govern-ment policy on this question, and calling upon the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to organise a campaign against the Bill. It has, however, been realised that as the Bill must pass into law before the end of the current month, such a campaign will be somewhat late in the day, and the London Labour Party has shown a more prae-tical and helpful spirit in arranging to establish &quot; tenants&apos; inquiry bureaux &quot; in various parts of London, with a view to making tenants fully acquainted with the provisions of the Act. It may be suggested, hwever, that the resources of the London Labour Party are hardly equal to the task, and that many more than the proposed seven bureaux will be required.The Scottish Labour Housing Association is continuing to advertise the idea of a no-rent strike. It is reported that it proposes to &quot;extend its activities to the North of England ; and a conference will be held in Glasgow on the 31st July at which endeavours will be made to persuade Mr. Robert Smillie to propose a &quot; no-rent &quot; resolution.Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill.The National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship and the London Society for Women&apos;s Service have circulated a memorandum criticising the provision of this Bill which prohibits all night-work by women. The objection is to the differentiation between adult women and men, and it is argued that the prohibition should be made much more general, and should be based upon the type of work and not upon the sex of the worker. This is in general agreement with the attitude of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, noted below, but contrary to that of the International Congress of Women Workers, of the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild and of the Standing Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations. These latter bodies may be taken as more closely representative of indus-trial women workers.Unemployment Insurance.As a result of the annual meeting of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed, a committee has been set up by the Alliance to consider the question of insurance against unemployment and to produce a scheme. The committee will first circulate a general questionnaire in order to secure evidence on which to base its investigations. The em-ployees&apos; representatives on the committee are : Mr. Solomon Hill, of the Birmingham and District Engineering Allied Trades Society; Mr. Arthur Pugh, Iron and Steel Trades Confederation; Miss Julia Varley, Womens Branch of the Workers&apos; Union; and.Mr. Harry Dubery, of the Federation of Post Office Supervising Trade Unions. The employers&apos; representatives are : Major D. C. McLagan, of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers ; Mr. Charles Tennyson, Federation of British Industries; Mr. Philip H. Lockhart, of Messrs. W. and A. Bates, Ltd.; and Mr. T. E. Jackson, Incorporated Associa-tion of Retail Distributors.
Finance Bill.An emergency conference convened by the Co-operative Union and attended by 1,200 delegates was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 16th and 17th inst. A reso -lution was passed protesting against the application to Co-operative Societies&apos; profits of the proposed Corporation Tax on the ground that this would violate the principle that mutual trading could not produce taxable income. The special income tax committee of the Co-operative Union was given authority &quot; to take all steps to protect the interests of the co-operative movement in the matter.&apos;&apos; It does not appear that the proposed changes^ in the income tax exemption, abatements and allowances have received much criticism or appreciation in the trade union world, but prosecutions of workmen on account of non-payment of income tax are common and the S.W.M.F. demands exemption for all incomes under  400.Employment Exchanges.The first meeting of the Committee of Inquiry into the working and administration of the Employment Exchanges was held on the 16th inst. The first public sessions took place on the 21st and 22nd inst., when evidence was submitted by Sir James Masterton-Smith,, Joint Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour, Mr. T. W. Phillips, Principal Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour, Commander J. B. Adams, General Manager of the Employment Exchanges, and Mr. G. H. Wood, Secretary of the Worsted and Woollen Trade Federations.National Union of Railwaymen.During the week under review this union has been active in connection with three very important issues, namely, the position in Ireland, the general question of sympathetic action in trade disputes, and also of the award of the National Wages Board.The outcome of the special conference between the executive of the N.U.R. and delegates from the Irish branches of the union, which was held at Bristol on the 16th and 17th inst., was the unanimous adoption of a series of resolutions which were presented to the Prime Minister on the 18th inst. by a deputation from the conference. The resolutions endorsed the action of the executive in summoning the conference, expressed the opinion that the present outrages in Ireland were the inevitable result of the Governments failure to govern Ireland in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people, and instructed, the deputation to lay before the Prime Minister the serious situation now existing in Ireland and the grave danger of a continuation, of violence. The deputation, however, made a specific proposal in asking the Prime Minister to discontinue the sending of troops or munitions to Ireland until after the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress to be held on 13th July. The Prime Minister, however, refused to recognise the suggestion of the deputation that it could arrest further disorders in Ireland during that period. The conference with the Prime Minister, thus brought matters no nearer the desired solution, and the position at the North Wall Station, Dublin, is unchanged. The Irish Council of the N.U.R. are holding a meeting in Dublin on the 23rd June to consider the situation. In connection with the annual con-ference of the Labour Party, Mr. J. H. Thomas made a speech on the 20th at Scarborough and impressed upon his audience the extreme gravity of the position and his wish that nothing would be done to make that position worse. Mr. Thomas fears a general suspension of work on the Irish railways.With regard to sympathetic action in industrial disputes, the executive of the N.U.R., at its quarterly meeting on Monday, June 7th, and the following days, passed a resolution expressing their opinion that it. was &quot; not the function of a single Trade Union &quot;to be the custodian of the other Trade Unions until the Trade Union movement organises itself along the lines of creating a fighting fund to meet the expenses of any Union or group of Unions who may be involved in disputes necessitating the withdrawal of Labour.&quot; They instructed the General Secretary to bring this matter before the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the T.U.C. with a view to the whole matter being brought before the next Trades Union Congress. In the meantime, it was decided to take no further action on the appeals for sympathetic action until the Trades Union Congress had given its decision. There has recently been a notable increase in demands for sympathetic action on the part . of railwaymen in connection with trade disputes. Such sympathetic action has already been mentioned in connection with a strike of carters and yard men working for certain firms at Bridport, the strike of clerks at Messrs. Lever Bros., Port Sunlight, the strike of shop assistants employed by Messrs. J. Lewis and Co., London, and a strike of wholesale grocery warehousemen at Newcastle.   In these cases, what action was taken appears
; nMiners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.The statistical summary of output and costs of production, proceeds and profits of the coal mining industry as a whole for the quarter ending 31st March, 1920, was published on the 17th inst., and has already received the attention of the leaders of the M.F.G.B. Mr. Hartshorn has declared that the return, which shows an available gross profit, over the whole of the industry, of 5s. Id. per ton, proves thai there has been no justification for the recent increases in the price of coal. The executive of the M.F.G.B., meeting at Scarborough in connection with the Labour Party Conference, has also given consideration to this document, but the publication of any specific proposals has been postponed until the annual conference of the Federation at Leamington on the 6th July.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.The annual conference of the S.W.M.F. was concluded at Cardiff on the 17th inst. Many resolutions on income tax were discussed, and it was Ultimately decided that the conference should use all its influence to raise the income tax exemption to  400 per annum, and that the abolition of all indirect taxation should be pressed for. Resolutions submitted in favour of abolishing the present rule by which 14 days&apos; notice must be given to ter-terminate contracts of employment were defeated. The most important resolution was that the Federation should tender three months&apos; notice for the total abolition of piece-work by all grades of colliery workers in the South Wales and Monmouthshire coalfield, but it was decided that, before giving effect to the resolution, a ballot should be taken of the coalfield to decide whether the men were prepared to adopt a strike policy to enforce this demand. A proposal for the unification of piece rates of wages and the classification of all colliery workers according to three categories was confirmed. The base rate demanded for those to be in category I. is 10s. per day, and for those in category II. 9s. per day; boys&apos; to be paid on a basis of from 3s. to 8s. per day will be placed in category III. On the question of prices a resolution was passed that the time was long overdue when the question of the high cost of living should be seriously fought. &quot; For that purpose we ask that continuous increases in wages be sought for counterbalancing the effect of high prices.&quot; In the meantime the M.F.G.B., the Triple Alliance, and the T.U.C. are to be asked to take measures to bring about the decrease in the cost of food, and &quot; unless the cost of living be reduced by August 1st this year, we ask that industrial action be taken to enforce our demands.&quot; There is nothing further to report with regard to the progress of the final ballot of the members of the S.W.M.F. on the question of paying the increased subscriptions to the M.F.G.B., on which depends the continued affiliation of the South Wales miners to the national federation.to have been largely unofficial, and in no case effective. Some confusion arose in the case of the Lewis strike from Mr. Thomas&apos;s double position as Secretary of the N.U.R. and President of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. The matter has been brought to a head perhaps in view of the grave consequences which followed the official action of the N.U.R. with regard to the transport of Polish munitions.With regard to the award of the National Wages Board, it was announced on the 16th inst. that the Cabinet had accepted the conclusions of the Board. It was stated that particular considerations had been given to paragraph 43 of the Report, in which the Board expressed the view that the settlement should not be disturbed for such a period as would facilitate a return to stability of industry and commerce. This view was accepted by the Cabinet, with the qualification that, should forthcoming increases of railway rates and charges, consequent in a large measure upon the increased cost of labour, not produce additional revenue, it would be impossible to maintain the present level of wages. So far as can be gathered from reports received, it may be judged that railwaymen as a whole have made up their minds to accept the award. A national strike is the only alternative to acceptance, and there is a general feeling that a strike at the present time would fail. This feeling has been strengthened by the non- success of the &quot; work-to-rule &quot; movement and by the knowledge that the deciding factor in a railway strike is the attitude of the general public, which at present is not too favourable to railwaymen. At many branch meetings resolutions expressing dissatisfaction with the award have been passed, and special hostility has been shown to the differentiation between the men employed in rural and industrial areas, but at West Hartlepool, Newcastle and Crewe definite resolutions have been adopted accepting the award. In many cases it has been urged that some action should be taken to force the Government to secure a. reduction in the cost of living.
The womens Go-operative Guild.The annual Congress of the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild was held at Derby on the 16th and 17th June. The Guild constitutes the women&apos;s section of the Co-operative Movement; it elects two members to the Central Board of the Co-operative Union, and is also recognised specifically on the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Move-ment. Besides the representation of the interest of women on these organisations, its object is to organise women co-operators with a view to the promotion of interest in the business side of co-operative undertakings and in all questions relating to national welfare.The chief resolutions passed at last week&apos;s congress called upon the societies to put forward women candidates for Parliament, and protested against the imposition of any tax on the surplus profits of co-operative societies and the prevailing high prices of food and clothing. A resolution was also carried expressing gratification at the Convention adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference with regard to the employment of women before and after child-birth, and calling upon the Government to introduce into Parliament a Bill which, besides giving effect to the Convention, shall provide for the granting of maternity benefits on a universal and non-contributory basis.The Trade Union Movement and Adult Education.There have been two significant movements recently revealing the state of the development of the educational side of the Labour movement. The Buskin College Fellowship have suggested to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress that some method should quickly be found for co-ordinating the work of Buskin College and various labour colleges and co-operative educational movements, the Working Men&apos;s Club and Institute Union, the Workers&apos; Educational Association and other organisations, and has expressed its readiness to send a deputation on the matter.A notable development in the provision of educational facilities for trade unionists was the formation last year of the Workers&apos; Educational Trade Union Committee. This Committee was set up by the W.E.A. at the request of the Iron and Steel Trades Con-federation under a constitution which makes it possible for any trade union affiliated to the W.E.A. to enter into similar arrangements. Within this Confederation the new movement has been taken up with energy, and the work commenced last year is being much extended this year. On the 10th and 11th April a week-end school of representative members of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation drawn from the local branches was held at Hill End, near Burnley. A second school was held in the same place on the 15th and 16th inst. Summer schools are being established at Bangor and in other places by the South Wales Division of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Other divisions of the Confederation (for example those in Durham) are making similar arrangements. All these meetings are being held under the auspices of the Workers&apos; Educational Trade Union Committee and all the expenditure incurred is met by the trade union concerned.The appeal of the Buskin College Fellowship is of interest because of the proposed re-organisation of the activities of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, while the activities of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation may form a more valuable precedent for the fuller participation of Trade Unions in the provision of further education of their members than is ordinarily provided by the W.E.A.Dockyard Discharges.The Committee of the Chatham and District Trades and Labour Council, which has been considering the discharges of men from Chatham Dockyard, reports that it has come to the conclusion that the &quot;necessity to curtail expenditure&quot; put forward by che Government as the reason for the discharges is incorrect, and that the true reason for their action is a desire to assist thereby outside private firms ; that the alleged difficulty of putjbing into operation the recommendations of the Colwyn Committee in favour of mercantile building, resulting from the demarcation rules of the trade unions, has now been removed, the respective craft unions having arrived at a mutual understanding on the question. After careful consideration of the evidence on the alleged increased cost of production in comparison with private yards, as well as the distance of the yards from the raw materials, the Committee concludes that neither of these points can be substantiated. The Committee further urge that in order that cost-may be materially lessened, the stores and tool-rooms in the yard be brought up to date and that the workers be given a greater share in the control of work executed, by which means a considerable saving in the numbers of supervisory officials would be made possible. Various proposals follow for the introduction of schemes of new work.
i    118* Page 275.Trade Union Topics.Seafarers&apos; Joint Council. The Seafarers&apos; Joint Council has recently drawn up a -comprehensive scheme for the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1906. It intends, as soon as its scheme is complete, to forward it in the form of a draft Bill to the Government and to ask for its immediate introduction into Parliament: The final form of this Bill on many points of detail, of course, will be determined by the decisions of the International Labour Conference now in session at Genoa, but the British-proposals will include a large number of points which will not come before the Genoa --conference. national Amalgamated Union of SJiop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. It is reported that this union has decided to take no further action on the question of amalgamation with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees until the result of the ballots on the proposed fusion of the latter union with the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union is known. All the arrangements for the fusion of the National Association of Grocers&apos; Assistants with the Shop Assistants&apos; Union will have been completed by July 1st, on which date the fusion will take place.Operative Bakers and Confectioners of Scotland National Federal Union. The annual conference of this union was held at Glasgow on the 15th and 16th inst. A voluntary levy was authorised of Is. per member to form the nucleus of a Parliamentary fund in order that the union might put forward a candidate in some constituency at the next general election. By a large majority a resolution was adopted in favour of the elimination of female labour from the trade, and in this connection the President declared that the large number of unemployed men, due to demobilisation and other causes, demanded urgent attention. It was resolved that should the forthcoming special meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which is to meet on the 16th July, decide on a policy of direct action in connection with the cost of living and increases of rent, the executive should take a ballot of the members on the question of a stoppage of work. The Factories and Workshops (Bakehouses) Bill was approved, and the position of apprentices in the union was discussed. It was decided that they should not take part in ballot votes on : matters affecting journeymen. A committee was appointed to meet representatives of the English and Irish unions to draft a scheme for the formation of a federation of unions in the baking and confectionery trades.Communist Party.As was announced in this Report last week.* the conference of extreme Socialist groups convened by the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation met on the 19th inst. In addition to delegates of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation and its branches, the conference was attended by representatives of a number of small local extremist bodies, namely, the Aberdeen, Croydon, and Holt Communist groups, the Stepney Communist League, the Gorton Socialist Party, the Labour Abstentionist Party, and the Manchester Soviet. The conference was therefore dominated by the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, but the * representation of the other small bodies, however unimportant they may be, gave it the general character&apos; which was desired by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst. The conference passed resolutions accepting the three Communist principles of the dictatorship of the Proletariat, the Soviet system, and the Third International, but, added to these, the two further principles of non-affiliation to the Labour Party and abstention from Parliamentary&apos; action. As a logical result of the adoption of these latter two principles, it was decided not to take part in the Communist Unity Convention which has been summoned for the 1st August, or in the negotiations concerned with it. It will be remembered that the conference of the 1st August is based upon an acceptance of the first three of these Communist principles, but leaves the last two open for discussion. The conference then proceeded unanimously to form itself into a Communist Party, to be the British section of the Third International. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; was adopted as the first official weekly organ of the Party, and Miss Sylvia Pankhurst was chosen to edit it.The anticipations in this report last week with reference to the question of Communist Unity have therefore been confirmed. The Communist Unity group of expelled S.L.P. : members and the British Socialist Party are left as the sole participants in the Communist Unity Convention for the 1st August. The Workers&apos; Socialist Federation is emphatically determined not to ally itself with the British Socialist Party. The Socialist Labour Party is excluded from Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs Communist Party by the principle of abstention from Parliamentary action and is equally debarred from the August 1st conference by the
presence there of the Communist Unity group composed of members which it has recently expelled. The adoption by Miss Pankkursfs conference of the title of &quot; Communist Party &quot; to which the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation has, indeed, more claim than any other body, is a tactical victory over the British Socialist Party which, if it adopts a Communist title, will have to qualify its communism.With regard to the attitude of the Moscow International to these squabbles, it may be judged that it will be careful not to commit itself to one or the other of the two bodies. x Lenin&apos;s manifesto, for example, though it singled out Miss Sylvia Pankhurst for honourable mention among Communists, was addressed to the British Socialist Party and intended for original insertion in &quot; The Call.&quot;4American Federation of Labour.A short account of the opening proceedings of the 40th annual convention of the American Federation of Labour at Montreal was given in this report last week. The convention has subsequently adopted a resolution confirming its endorsement of the Irish Republic and appealing to the workers of Great Britain to exert their influence for an immediate withdrawal of the Army of Occupation from Ireland and the recognition of Irish self-determination. The convention also adopted a resolution, despite the strenuous opposition of Mr. Gompers, by a nearly 4 to 1 vote, in favour of the nationalisation of the railways and a share of the workers in control. Mr. Gompers personally took the floor and argued that public ownership meant Government slavery. The building trade was the only craft union voting almost solidly with Mr. Gompers ; the railwaymen, miners, textile, garment, and metal trades, composed the overwhelming majority for nationalisation. The result is regarded as a signal defeat for Mr. Gompers.International Woman Suffrage &quot;Alliance.The first Congress of the Alliance since 1913 was held at Geneva from the 7th to the 12th June. In all representatives were present from 31 countries, including official delegates from four Governments, namely, the United States, Great Britain, Sweden and Uruguay. The British official delegate was Lady Astor, M.P. Mrs. Chapman Catt (United States) presided. The principal subjects under discussion were the scope and future of the Alliance, proposals to set up a special organisation in connection with the League of Nations to represent the interests of women, and the provisions of a Women&apos;s Charter, which had been drafted for consideration. The terms of the Charter proposed for adoption included demands for equal political and civic rights and for &quot; equal pay for equal work,&quot; on the understanding that no special regulations or restrictions be introduced with regard to women&apos;s work or to the right to work of both married and unmarried women. In connection with the industrial clauses of the Charter the Congress condemned the adoption by the Washington International Labour Conference of the principle of distinguishing between men and women in industry. Their own claim for absolute equality, however, was strongly criticised by the representative of the International Congress of Women Workers, which body endorses the Washington Conventions.T. J.
