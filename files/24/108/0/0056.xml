T&apos;rIE ANGLO PBRBM PETROLEUM AGREEMENT Affg MESOPOTAMIA . Memorandum for the Cabinet by the First Lord of the Admiralty.On &quot;behalf of the Admiralty, I desire to support.the proposal of the Minister in charge of the Petroleum Department (C .P .1524, alternative (2)) that the oilfields of Mesopotamia should be worked by private enterprise, Government taking a substantial share of the production by way of royalty *It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of this question to the British Navy.   Before the war, the fuel of the British ifayy was predominantly coals   In consequence, of the construction of oil-burning vessels, the fuel oi the Navy is now predominantly oil,The approved provision for consumption at Lome and abroadduring the current year, amounts to a total of 1,113,000 tons;and owing to activities in the Baltic and Mediterranean, this estimate is likely to be exceeded8The consumption in succeeding years will increase as oil-burning units displace coal-burners and additional vessels are added to the Fleet *In addition to the above, it has been decided to raise our reserve stocks to 4,500,000 tons during the period of the next 10 years, i.oe*, an increase of over 3,000.000 tons over ourpresent stocks *The necessity for this4 course cannot be too strongly emphasized in view of the present serious position in which the Navy is placed by. dependence upon foreign supplies for lets fuel.As regards sources of supplies to meet the above requirements for expenditure and reserve, the position of the Admiralty for the next few years is partly safeguarded by standing contracts for Persian oil (400,000 tons rising to 500,000 tons per annum); for Mexican oil (200,000 tons per annumlj and for Trinidad oil (150,000 tons per annum)e   Apart from these regular sources of supply, the Admiralty is experiencing considerable difficulty in securing supplies of Admiralty quality fuel oil to meet the balance of expenditure and to complete the approved feserve. At the present moment, about 150,000 tons of oil is required tocomplete the quantity needed for reserve during the current year, and none of our regular suppliers is able to definitely promise delivery of this quantity.Further, the replacement&apos; of coal by oil as an industrial fuel lias been so rapid since the war, that the demand for oil has outpaced the supply - and there is at present a distinct shortage. This can only be overcome by the intensive development of existing oilfields and the exploiting of new oilfields.From the point of view of the Admiralty, therefore, .it is essential that the development of potential oilfields within the sphere of British influence or under.British control, such as that in Llesopotamia, should be pushed forward win all possible speed. It is strongly recommended that one of the conditions imposed on the Company formed to develop the Mesopotamian     field should be that the Government share in the production taken by way of royalty, should be in the form of fuel oil (not crude oil) for the Navy.(Initialled)   W. H. Lew29th.June, 1920.
