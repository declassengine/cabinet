[This Document is the Property-of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government].Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1920. -mmiiECRET.11 512 MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.Mr. CHURCH.TLL&apos;S paper on the future administration of Mesopotamia, CP. 1320, has raised the question of the administrative control of our interests in the Middle East, and the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs have both contributed memoranda on the subject (OP. 1402 and CP 1484).There is a large measure of agreement in the matter. Like Lord Curzon and Mr. Montagu, I have long been convinced that we need a new Department to direct our policy in all the Arab countries formerly under Turkish dominion Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia and in Persia. These countries cannot be successfully dealt with in water-tight compartments. Not only geographical continuity, but a similarity of character ethnic ties, religious ties, historical ties, a common type, no doubt with many variations, of social and political conditions constitute a close connection between them and cause the course of events in one member of the group to react powerfully upon the others. This has always been the case to a certain extent. That it is more than ever the case to-day has been impressed on me by my recent experiences in Egypt. Unity of conception in our dealings with the Arab and Moslem countries of the Middle East, in which our interests and responsibilities have been so greatly increased by recent events, is indispensable to success. This is equally necessary, whatever the degree of authority or influence we may think it possible or wise to exercise over any of them. In any case a single Department and a single Service seem essential for the successful control and conduct of our relations with them all. The Department here in London need not, in my opinion, be a large one. But it must consist of experts. For the Service, as I conceive it, the nucleus already exists in the Sudan-Egypt Service and the specialised branch of the diplomatic service which supplies our consular officers in the Levant. These might with advantage be amalgamated and enlarged so as to constitute a pool, from which, the administrative and diplomatic officers required in any of the countries referred to could be drawn. Transfers have already been made in exceptional cases from the Levant Service to Egypt and from Egypt to Mesopotamia. But hitherto such transfers, useful as they are, have been rendered difficult by the fact that we have to deal with a number of separate little services, with different rates of pay, pension arrangements, &amp;c. A general Middle Eastern Service, with a special course of training for its members, would not only facilitate transfers, but offer far greater attractions to men of ability and ambition than a number of small disconnected services, variously recruited, ever will.These are, as it seems to me, the essential requisites, and about them, as I have said, there is a great measure of agreement. But a difference of opinion exists as to. the place to be assigned to the new Department, when created, among our existing offices of State. By far the best plan would be to set up a new Ministry. But, assuming that this is, at the present time, impracticable, into which of the existing Ministries is the new Department to be dove-tailed ? Is it to be part of the India Office, or the Foreign Office, or the Colonial Office? There are objections to all of them. But, in my opinion, it does not greatly matter to which of the existing offices the new Department is attached, -provided it remains an absolutely distinct and self-contained entity, with its own Under-Secretary. Its staff clearly cannot be amalga-mated with that of any existing office, though it may, of course, be placed, as a separate Department, under one of the three Secretaries of State. In that case, it seems to me that the choice lies between the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for India, for the Colonial Secretary is already sufficiently distracted by having [3599]
to attend to two wholly dissimilar jobs, viz., the direct administration of a large number of Colonies and Protectorates, and the conduct of what are virtually diplomatic relations with the self-governing Dominions. If he is also to look after the Middle East, he will have to be relieved of the Dominions work, the amount of which is much greater than is commonly supposed, and is, I am glad to say, constantly growing as ties of a new kind spring up between the United Kingdom and the Dominions in place of the old relation of a. central authority to dependent communities. -  1But under whichever Secretary of State the new Department is placed, I agree with Lord Curzon and Mr. Montagu in holding that there will have to be a Standing Committee, to keep the Minister at the head of that Department in touch with those of his colleagues who, in the discharge of their several duties, are directly affected by the course of affairs in the Middle East. It is obvious that India is vitally concerned in what happens in Persia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. To a lesser but still a substantial extent, territories administered by the Colonial Office, such as Somaliland and British East Africa, are also affected by our policy with regard to Arabia and the Sudan. Moreover the Middle Eastern Department and the Colonial Office by virtue of its control of East Africa are both equally interested in Abyssinia. From other points of view also there is something to be said for bringing the experience of the Colonial Office to bear, only of course by way of consultation, upon the solution of Middle Eastern problems. For I do not quite agree &quot;with Lord Curzon that the work which the Colonial Office has done in Africa &quot; does not bear the remotest resemblance to that which will arise in the problems of the Middle East.&quot; On the contrary, there is in my opinion a great deal to be learnt in this respect from our recent dealings with, the Moslem Emirates of Nigeria, which certainly are not devoid of &quot; traditions of sovereignty and independence T&apos; and where we have been able to make successful use of native systems of government which have at least some of &quot;the characteristics of a civilised State.&quot;I do not wish, however, at this stage to enter into a discussion of the exact composition of an &quot;Eastern Committee.&quot; I fear I might find myself involved in proposals for a complete reconstruction of our Cabinet machinery. It is sufficient for the moment to record my adhesion to the view, that a co-ordinating body of some sort is necessary to keep the policy of the Middle Eastern Department in line with that of the other branches of the Government which are most closely related to it.M.June 17, 1920.
