1 Home Office,Whitehall,1 * 26th June, 1920.Dear Sir Maurice HankeyT1* -With reference to ray latter of the 1st June ^.C.P..1376.you may like to know that the Governing Body of the JDrternat&apos;Jonal labour Office, at its recent neeting, decided that, the matters * referred to in the telegram from the Hungarian Government being of a political character, it was outside the province of the International Labour Office to make an inquiry with regard to them.   They were willing, however, that the Office should make an enquiry into the industrial conditions in Hungary if the Hungarian Government wished it, and they authorised the Director of the Office to take the necessary measures for making such an inquiry*As regards the proposed mission oo Jxussia, the Director reported that he had been in direct communication with M, Litvinoff on the subject, but that LItvinoff had placed every possible difficulty in the way of the mission being sent, and it is extremely unlikely new that the proposed inquiry can be made*     The Office, however, has made a very exhaustiveexamination of all the literature available on the question of the industrial conditions in Russia, and has produced a volume which will shortly bo published. The volume seems to me to be very carefully prepared, and it contains a great deal of useful information,,     I enclose a copy*With regard to the other subject mentioned in my letter of-the 1st June, the Governing Body at its meeting decided to appoint a Committee to consider the question of the revision of the constitution of the Governing Body, as laid down in Article 393 of the Treaty of Peace*     I was appointed a I ember of the Committee&apos;*Yours sincerely,(Signed) MALCOLM.DEDBVIKG3SDB.aurice Eankey,&apos;G.CfcB.
^Mteiall,&apos; &apos; 29th March, 1920.Dear-.Sir maurice Hankey,The Governiiig Body of-1^^Off loo, which was mooting in Lori&amp;bn last week, came to two decisions of which I ought to iztform you.    The first relates to the proposal to send a Commission to russia to inquire into the industrial conoLltioas-under the: Soviet Government, about which I wrote to you last . January.    As you will be aware, M. Albert Thomas, the Director of the Labour Office, was in consultation with the Council of the League of nations on the. subject at their meeting in Paris on March 12th.    The Council of. .. the League offered no objection to the International Labour Office making a separate inquiry into the industrial, conditions of: Russia and the Governing Body has now decided to appoint a Commission as proposed,, The Commission is to consist of 5 representatives of Employers, 5 representatives of Workers, and 2 official representatives.    Each member of the Commission may be accompanied by two technical advisors.     The Governments of Great Britain and Prance are asked to appoint the official representatives on the Commission, the Governments of Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and Poland to nominate a technical adviser each.    It is hoped that, tho Commission will be able to leave for Bussia by the end of April.    k. $ontaine, the Chairman of the Governing Body, expressed to me the opinion that the Government representatives should be persons experienced in the investigation of industrial conditions in factories, mines, &amp;c.     I suggest that the Home Office, and tho Ministry of Labour should be consulted as to the appointment of the representative of Great Britain,-if the Government think it desirable to accept the invitation to nominate-a representative.       &apos;      .
The other decision relates to a resolution of the *International labour Conference at Washington last november that the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office should, ^appoint an International commission which.while giving due regard to the sovereign rightsof each State shall consider and: report what measurescan be adopted to regulate the migration of workersout of their own States., and to protect the interestsof wage, earners, residing, in a State other than theirown&quot;The Governing Body decided in accordance withthis resolution to appoint a Commission of 18 members,consisting of 6 Government representatives, 6 Employers1representatives,, and 6 Workers1 representative^, and toask Great iiritain to appoint the Chairman of theCommission.    The Departments mainly interested arethe Colonial Office, the Some Office (in connection withthe question of restrictions on aliens) and theMinistry of Labour, and I suggest that they should be consulted as to the ap 6intment of the Chairman.Yours very truly,(Signed) MALCOLM DEL3YIKN&amp;.
