DISPOSAL OF RIGID AIRSHIPS.I CIRCULATE herewith the report of a committee set up by the Air Council to consider the disposal of the rigid airships in our possession, and their utilisation for commercial transport, together with a Note prepared under my direction.  .W. S.&apos;C.June 26, 1920.Note.The estimated sum of  321,700 to be expended this year, for which no provision nas been made in the estimates, cannot, so far as can at present be foreseen, be met out of savings, and would therefore involve a supplementary estimate. -In considering the proposals of this report it is necessary to appreciate that the problem of the disposal of these airships has been the subject of long and anxious discussion by the Air Council. Any solution presents. great difficulties. On the one hand, it has to be remembered that a sum of nearly  40,000,000 was spent during the war on the formation of an airship service; that the airships now in question represent the culmination of a national effort in design, production and practical use, which placed this country second only to Germany in this sphere during the war, and should leave it first in peace ; that there is reason to believe that airships will in future play a large and, indeed, predominant part in long-distance air transport, and that this development will bring into existence a great number of these craft suitable for conversion, if required, to military use; that it is clearly in the national interest that this country should take a leading part in such development; that the legitimate hopes based on these considerations would be shattered if the airships (other than R 34 now in commission, and R 38 sold to the United States) were scrapped ; that it would cost us many millions hereafter if we desired to regain the position we are in at the present time, and that the reduction to produce of the four airships would entail a cost of approximately  14,000, and the probable cash return would hardly exceed  1,000 per ship. On the other hand must be set the fact that, at the present time there are no data to justify the investing public, or even private capitalists, in undertaking the running of these airships as a commercial proposition.In these circumstances the Air Council have carefully explored every scheme which appeared to give any prospect of the useful employment of the airships. Various negotiations have been undertaken, but have failed to mature. The report sketches out what must be regarded as, broadly speaking, the last hope of a successful solution. It is fully appreciated that&apos;the imperative need of economy in public finance makes the present time a particularly inappropriate one to suggest incurring additional expenditure of a considerable amount on a tentative and experimental scheme, especially if it must be followed next year by a, further gross expenditure which would be still larger, while the revenue to be set against that expenditure is confessedly quite uncertain. But the scheme must be regarded, as has already been said, as an alternative to scrapping the airships. The Air Council are, for their part, quite unable to take the responsibility of ordering this latter course, which would necessarily be a death-blow to British civil airship enterprise.The report has been submitted to the Treasury, whose reply is appended.At this stage, therefore, it becomes necessary to lay the question before the Cabinet for decision. The national interests which are at stake have been indicated above. They are so important that the argument irom existing financial embarrass-Reinforcements needs close examination. Moreover, the circumstances are such as to make it extremely difficult to explain to the public a decision to scrap the airships. Very general interest and curiosity is shown in the airships, now in an advanced state of completion or waiting their trials. The Country has paid large sums for them and is almost certainly ready to pay a comparatively small further sum in order to know what
performances they are capable of. It must be anticipated that their premature destruction will lead to a popular outcry.It will be seen from a perusal of the report that immediate steps would have to be taken if matters are tq be in such a position at the beginning of next financial year that the scheme can be properly tried out. -It is hoped, therefore, that the Cabinet will come to an early decision.Sir G. L. Barstow, Treasury, to the Secretary, Air Ministry.S/308.Sir, June 22, 1920.Ihave laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury your letter of the 14th instant (S. 12091/S. 5), recommending the expenditure during the next two years of a sum not exceeding 8M,400L (less possible receipt?) upon the experimental institution of a commercial airship service to Egypt.In reply, I am to state that my Lords fully recognise the difficulty of the existing, situation, and appreciate the manner in which the Air Ministry have presented their case.At the same time they feel bound to take the view that in the serious position of the national finances, expenditure of this magnitude upon a new service which, once entered upon, it will be most difficult to terminate or to limit, caunot be justified unless it is absolutely essential, a condition which they cannot regard as satisfied in the present case. My Lords observe that the Air Council are not prepared to sacrifice other services in favour of this scheme.In these circumstances they regret to be unable to approve the proposal, and they think that if the airships in question cannot otherwise be disposed of they must be scrapped.1 am, &amp;c.G. L. BARSTOW.
Confidential.AIR MINISTRY.report of the commercial airships committee.1. The Committee was appointed at a meeting of the Air Council on 5th May, 1920, to examine and report on certain conclusions provisionally adopted by the Council regarding the disposal of the airships in their possession, and particularly the proposal that the vessels should be utilised for the development of a scheme of commercial airship transport. The Committee was to be free to recommend any modifications of these conclusions which it might consider desirable.2. The conclusions provisionally adopted by the Council and referred to the Committee were as follows : (i) The work on completion of airships is to be slowed down.    1(ii) It is not intended this year to attempt any large development of airshiptransport.(iii) Occasional flights may be carried out with Service personnel for demon-stration purposes, especially with the object of educating commercial opinion.(iv) The airships should be completed as commercial craft, with suitablegondolas, &amp;c, for the purpose.(v) It should be the aim to organise a regular series of commercial flights to egypt, to commence in the spring of 1921.(vi) Suitable shed accommodation and gas plant should be erected in Egypt,such work to proceed now.(vii) Estimates for expenditure in 1921-22 to be prepared accordingly, and negotiations to be continued with commercial bodies with the above aims in view.(viii) The cost of the shed, gas plant, &amp;c. (to be provided in Egyyt) is to be examined in relation to the current year&apos;s estimates, (ix) The question of opening Pulham station to be investigated and a scheme of accommodation of airships on above basis to be worked out.3. We have commenced by examining the present position with regard to airships both completed and still under construction.   These are as follows : Completed.R. 34 at Howden, the Service Station, is in commission as a Service airship. R. 33 at Howden, used as a reserve to R. 34.R. 32 at Howden, used for training American naval personnel in preparation forthe flight of the R. 38 to America in J 921. * *Under zonstruction.R. 36 at Inchinnan (Messrs. Beardmores) is being completed, and can thereafter be stored at Pulham.R. 38 at Cardington, the Royal Airship Works (lately Messrs. Shorts), must be completed by the end of December for handing over to the American authorities, to be flown to America in 1921. .R. 37 at Cardington, being slowly completed; can remain there till February 1921 without interfering with the work of the station, which will probably include the construction of-R.  , a new airship of 5,000,000 cubic feet capacity, which it is proposed to construct for the Americans at Cardington.R. 80 at Barrow (Messrs. Vickers), will probably be completed about August 1920. &apos;o (33) 11205  Pk C 116 (F 642)   125  6/20  E &amp; S
German Airships.The delivery of these to the Allied Powers has not yet commenced. This country might possibly receive up to four ultimately. There are definitely in prospect: L. 71, which is likely to &quot;be handed over shortly and will be brought to this country and stored for the present at Pulham, which station is.now in the hands of a care and maintenance party only, and contains no vessels.L. 61 or another vessel of similar type. (Arrangements are not so far advanced as for L. 71.)4. In accordance with the decision to complete the airships as commercial craft and to organise, if possible, a regular series of commercial flights to Egypt (para. 2, (iv) and (v)), we have endeavoured to devise a scheme for the utilisation of the vessels in the most advantageous manner.5. In particular, we have considered whether such a scheme would best achieve the double result of (a) demonstrating the possibilities of airship transport as a regular service placed at the disposal of the commercial world ; also gaining experience, not hitherto available, of the working of regular airship traffic ; and (6) leading to a system capable of being run at a commercial profit.6. We have examined the possibilities of a scheme consisting of localised tours only, or voyage and return over short distances, with the use of only one terminal station. We have come to the conclusion that such, a scheme would really achieve no object of value. It would not demonstrate a true development of the possibilities of airship transport, and it would furnish no experience of the system which will have to be adopted finally when such transport is used to an important extent, namely, a system of long-distance travel with an efficient station at each terminus. We are in fact convinced that the smallest programme which it would be worth while to carry out would be a regular series of flights, say, once a fortnight in each direction, between England and Egypt, involving the setting up of a new airship station in that country with shed, mooring-out mast, and such other facilities as are essential to the efficient working of the station as a terminus, non-essentials being cut down to a minimum. We are of opinion, moreover, for reasons given in paragraph 15 below, that this scheme should be under the control of commercial experts.Assuming, however, that the service to Egypt is made the main objective, we think that useful assistance could be obtained by organising shorter experimental and demonstration flights wherever possible. In particular such flights might be carried out as a preliminary to the main scheme.7. For such a purpose we contemplate that three airships could be made avail-able, to commence a series of flights in April 1921, and a fourth could be kept in reserve as a spare. The four would be R. 33, R. 3G. R. 37, and L. 71. The vessel kept in reserve could be changed from time to time. The adaptation of these airships for commercial purposes, would form part of the scheme.On the assumption that this arrangement is adopted, the remaining airships would be disposed of as follows :......R. 34 would remain at Howden as a service craft.R. 32 would be scrapped to-make room at Howden forR. 38, which would be moved from Cardington by the end of December, andwould thereafter be prepared for flight to America. R. 80 would leave Barrow when completed and would be housed at Pulham, and later moved to Howden on the departure of R. 38.   R. 80 would be usedfor experimental purposes, for mooring, &amp;c, and would be of value both tothe Service and to the commercial scheme. The distribution of , shed accommodation on the above lines is shown in Appendix II.In addition to these arrangements, it may be necessary to retain Barlow shed at present as a temporary measure; to allow certain repairs to the R. 34, and alterations to R. 33 to be carried out. R. 33 can be used in place of R. 34, while the latter is under repair.We have considered the question of disposal of German airship sheds, and we are of opinion that this matter had better be dealt with separately, provided that.if there are any of these sheds which it would pay to transport to this country, and which are not required by the Cardington establishment, they should be offered for
sale to British. Airship Constructors and&apos; should not be utilised for the purpose now under consideration, for which, we think, their use would involve too great expense.8. For the flights to Egypt, the home terminal station should be Pulham. This station is at present closed and employs only a care and maintenance party. There is room at Pulham for two of the airships used on the flights, (and in addition for the R. 80. which is a smaller type), and we consider that the other two&apos;would be accommodated (after the service commences), one at the Egyptian base, or else actually en route, and the spare one at Howden. As there would be facilities for mooring-out at Howden, Pulham, and the Egyptian base, we think that this allotment of accommodation would suffice, even in the event of breakdowns or unforeseen delays.9. It will be impossible at present, we think, to arrange for the provision of a fully-equipped station to serve as a port of call on the Continent. It is equally impracticable to send out British personnel to the Continent to attend to the needs of the vessels calling en route. There is some probability of sheds at Marseilles being available, and the scheme we have in view contemplates a call at Marseilles on each journey, local facilities and personnel being employed on each occasion.10. The actual amount of flying on which we have based our estimate of the cost is 30 journeys of 50 hours&apos; in each direction, a total of 3,000 hours flying to be .performed by three vessels flying: 1,000 hours each during the year. This would amount, roughly, to a fortnightly service in each direction. It has been estimated that 35 passengers could be carried on each single journey at a fare of, say, 507,. to IOOiL, and that the revenue so obtained would amount to 100,000L to 200,0001. per annum. We prefer, however, not to put forward any estimate of this amount for deduction from the annual costs of the service, in view of the fact that returns under this heading are bound to be very uncertain and variable especially in the initial stages of the undertaking. Such amounts would, under the scheme which we recommend in this report, be the property of the Government.11. With regard to the question of personnel required this, year, the current estimates allow of an establishment at Howden of 30 officers and 615 men. We have examined the question whether the proposal now under consideration can be carried out with the existing personnel, but are unable to put forward such a suggestion as practicable. The full complement of Howden, namely, 615 men, must be maintained, and are all required for ordinary work apart from the present scheme. Howden is the store depot for airship services and is also the airship experimental flying headquarters. The staff are employed continuously on the three airships now housed there and they have to attend to the non-rigids which are flown from the same station. The R. 32 also is out almost daily in connection with the training of the American personnel. We are of opinion, consequently, that none of the Howden establishment should be reckoned as available for the new scheme of additional work.We think that since Pulham station will have to be opened again, and two or possibly three airships are to he stored there this year, the additional personnel required during the current year over and above the number included in the existing estimate amounts to 6 officers and 100 men. In fixing these figures we have borne in mind that one of the three airships at Pultiam is in all likelihood to be the German L. 71, which, for various reasons, it will probably be found necessary to experiment with, during the present year.12. With regard to the estimate of personnel required to carry on the service in 1921-22, we consider that 16 officers and 550 men would be necessary at PuJham, if the undertaking were to be run on a Service basis. At the Egyptian base there would be required 16 officers, 200 men, and 250 unskilled native labour. In addition three complete airship crews are required, since three ships are to be operated which otherwise would not be in use.13. We have given particular attention to the question whether the undertaking now under discussion would he better run on a Service basis or on a Civil basis. We have come to the conclusion that for material charges there cannot be any great difference in cost between the two systems, but that in personnel the civil system would be more economical, owing to the various charges neeessarily incurred in connection with a Service establishment which are to a great extent saved by commercial institutions. The personnel required for Pulham on this basis would be reduced to 12 officials and foremen, 150 skilled and 250 unskilled men; for thea 2

Apart from the considerable saving involved, in running this scheme on a civil basis, it appears certain that service methods of working would in any case fail to produce the data essential in order to influence favourably commercial opinion in this country and elsewhere. If the future of commercial airship transport is to be judged on the results of the efforts now proposed (as we are convinced that it will be), we feel strongly that the undertaking must be carried out on commercial lines and by methods familiar to the commercial experts with whose appreciation or criticism they are likely to meet. For this reason we hold that steps should be taken at once to secure the interest of a strong commercial body such as a Board of Management, who would examine and watch the preparations now to be put in hand, with a view to taking over the working of the scheme in the spring of 1921. The Treasury should be approached for sanction to hand over to this body in the spring of 1921, the estimated sum of 400,0007., being part of the above 522,7007., which we think repre-sents the cost of running the service for one year, not including the cost of constructing the Egyptian base, and of erecting the mast at Pulham. There should be no necessity to obtain separate sanction for each item of expenditure as it becomes necessary. The Board should be given a lump sum and should be left with a free hand. We wish to express very strongly our opinion that in no other way would the project have a chance of success. With regard to personnel the Board should be at liberty to appoint their own staffs. The Airship crews would require six months&apos; training in any case, and it would perhaps be best to &quot;second&quot; service personnel for the commercial scheme. Apart from these, there might be a few service personnel lent for detail work, but the bulk of the staff would be selected entirely by the Board themselves. The whole scheme would be under the general supervision of the Controller General of Civil Aviation.16. Our findings are sumarised briefly as follows :  (i) The conclusions provisionally adopted by the Council, and detailed in paragraph 2, should be finally adopted and acted on.Egyptian base, 16 officials, 120 white men and 250 natives. The airship crews would cost approximately the same in either case.In whichever of these two ways the undertaking is managed, we are clearly of opinion that as soon as the project is sanctioned it will be necessary (a) to obtain without delay the additional 6 officers and 100 men, mentioned in &apos;paragraph 11, who are required to look after the vessels this year in preparation for the commercial work next year. (6) to commence the erection of the base in Egypt at once.14. We have prepared a rough estimate of the sums required ,..(a) As a supplementary expense for the current year in connection with the proposal.(6) As a sum.to be inserted in the estimates for 1921-22 specifically for the purpose.It is not yet certain whether the station in Egypt can be erected in a position adjoining an existing aeroplane station. If so, a certain economy would be effected by sharing various facilities, and also in erecting the structure.On the assumption that such economies are not possible, we roughly estimate the costs as under : 
(ii) Sanction should be obtained to expend a sum of 321,700Z. in the current year as a supplementary, and to include provision for an expenditure next year of 522,700?.(iii) Sanction should be obtained to hand over a sum of 400,0001 (being part ofthe above 522,7001.) to- a Board of Management for the purpose of carrying out the commercial airship service during the financial year 1921/22 under the general supervision of the Controller-General of Civil Aviation.(iv) Although this development, if approved, is to take place next year, the preparations required are of such magnitude that an early decision is imperative.(v) &quot;As soon as approval is given, the erection of the base in Egypt should be commended immediately.(vi) The Board of Management of commercial experts should be set up at once,to watch and examine the preparations this year, prior to taking over control of the whole scheme in the spring of 1921.LONDONDERRY (Chairman).H.
