--(P 4915)This &apos; DocurnBJit tsjhe, j j.;; P--;L4-&quot;1.3 i;^;Z*Vo?n Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, -21st Jime 1920.(Received 22nd, 10.30 a.m.764 S. Your telegram, of&apos; 15th June, clear line, was despatched, obviously, a before the receipt of oar telegram of 15th June, 739 S., which, I hope, will have reassured you. &apos; Whole object throughout these discussions here has been to present the Afghans, on important questions such as Turkish peace terms and Waziristan policy, with a series of fait accomiili against which it is vain for them to protest, and which can be explained and not modified. Dobbs&apos; written reports, forwarded with, my Foreign Secretary^ weekly letters, show that he has been most uncompromising with regard to ,the Turkish terms and has treated them in spirit of vcandid realism which alone appeals to the Afghan mind.
