L- 5 i      IMP0R3?  REGUIATIOfl   (KEY INDUSTRIES)   BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of (Trade.will be remembered that after very oareful consideration a&amp; Imports and Exports Regulation Bill was introduced into the House of Commons in November last, dealing with dumping, collapsed exchanges, key industries and certain other matters. The Bill met with much opposition and was not proceeded with. It has been announced in the House of Commons recently that the Government would proceed with an i&amp;ti-Dumping Bill this Session, but that no indication could be given of its precise nature9 The question therefore   arises as to the action which should now be taken,legislation to deal with dumping and the possible flood of imports from countries whose exchange has collapsed, is at the present time not very urgent although there are isolated cases in whioh British Tradersare seriously hampered by the depredation of foreign ourrency in relation to sterling.    The state of Parliamentary business j is, moreover, such that it is more than doubtful whether a measure containing anything so controversial as anti-dumping provisions oould be carried in the time available during the present session,    in indication of the Government!s general policy in this matter might, however, and may have to.be given to Parliament on some convenient opportunity.On the other hand, some legislation with regard to key industries is now a very pressing matter.    I have had numerous demands from traders and associations of manufacturers to have the situation as to key industries cleared up without delay. In the case of dye stuffs promises have been made on behalf of the Government to the effect that importation would be prohibited for a period of ten years, and a very considerable part of the large capital of the British Dyestuffs Corporation ltd., was undoubtedly subscribed on the strength of these promises which were recited, with Board of 3bfade sanction, in the prospectus of the Company.    Assurances of a less definite character have also from time to time been given that certain other k$y industries would be safeguarded, and manufacturers have laid down plant in reliance upon these assurances - a reliance which was strengthened by the fact that the prohibition of the pro-ducts of these industries was continued after all other pro-hibitiona of imports were removed at the beginning of last September.    Although Germany and the ccuntries which formed part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, which were the chief sources of supply before the War, are diserganised and are not yet in a position to export the commodities in question in any considerable quantity, there is little doubt that their competition with British producers is reviving - at least in the case of Germany!    Certain of the commodities in question are also produoed in Vranoe. Switzerland, Sweden, Japan and United States,    i have evidence that in some cases buyers are holding eff owing to the possibility of purchasing at lower prices from abroad, manufacturers are in great uncertainty, no., development is taking place and there is serious risk that much of the ground gained during the war may be lost.    The German dye manufacturers, in spite of their difficulties are ; making every effort tt recover their hold on the United Kingdom market;   there is a large importation of cheap binoculars from France, which is causing serious embarrassment to the optical instrument makers, to whom the binocular trade i&amp; of great importance as giving a broad basis to their industry;   and foreign competition is becoming very active in suoh
commodities as hosiery needles and gas mantles.I am of opinion that legislation must Toe carried through during the &quot;present Session to safeguard key or special industries, hut that it should ho limited to that purpose. The Imports and Exports Regulation Bill which, was presented to the House of Commons last year and not proceeded with gave the Beard of Trade power to prohibit the&apos; importation of certain &quot;key&quot; commodities except under licence.-    licences could &quot;be given either without payment of any fee, or on payment ox a licence foe which was to &quot;be subject to variation from time to time, and was to be based on the difference between the imported price of the foreign commodity and a reasonable remunerative price to the British manufacturer.    Critics of the Bill took great exception to the uncertainty involved in this method ef procedure and some free Traders went so far as to say that they would prefer a Tariff.    I have considered the possibility of dealing with key industries by a simple tariff and have oome to the conclusion that it would by itself be ineffective. In the case of dyes tuffs for example some dyes might be &quot; adequately protected by a duty of 50 per cent ad valorem, while in the ease a  others (including those which it is most neoessarj to protect) a duty of as much as 100 per cent ad valorem would have no appreciable effect.    The same consideration applies in the case of other synthetic organic chemicals and optical glass and optical instruments.    It must also be remembered that expectations have been treated by the White Paper of November 1918 and by official Statements made in the House of Commons that dyes -would be dealt with in this way.Another possibility is a system of subsidies, brut I am satisfied that the end desired cannot be effectively attained &quot;by subsidies only.    There is always great difficulty about the allocation ef subsidies; tiaey would certainly prove very costly and necessitate much detailed supervision of the operations of the manufacturers engaged in tie subsidised industry so as to secure that the subsidies did not result in uneconomic methods of working, extravagance and waste of public money; while some regulation of prices er profits would almost certainly have to be superimposed.After very careful consideration of the whole subject, I have come to the conclusion that the proper cairse to adopt is a system of prohibition and licensing in respect not only of dyes and other synthetic organic chemicals and optical glass but also of the other commodities which it is necessary to safeguard, a charge being made upon the., importation of goods under such licences-The&apos; question however remains as tpSszhat the basis of charge is to be,     The uncertainty involved in the system contained in the previous Bill did much to bring about its condemnation  . and I am of opinion that some method must be adopted which would leave the trader in no doubt as to the impost which importation of foreign goods is to bear.
The imports and Exports Regulation&quot;Bill provided that the Board ofTrade, subject to the approval of the Trade&quot; Regulation Committee proposed t6 he set up under Part I of the&quot; Bill; might fix from time to time licensing fees which should not at the time of their imposition^ greater than the difference between tho sterling valtte of the imported goods and the -price at which similar goods manufactured in the United Kingdom can bo sold in&quot;similar quantities for&quot; delivery at the manufactofy-.   &quot;From the administrative point of view, however^ this  revision was open to tjie objection that it laid upon the Board of&quot;Trade the task 6f determining the reasonable selling prices Of a wide range of &quot;commodities and would necessitate the employment of a very donslderable staff.    Moreover, strong exoeption was taken to &quot;power being., given to any Department, even witji the &quot;approval of the proposed Trade Regulation CommitteeP to vary what would be, in fact, import duties^ without the express &quot;approval of Parliament in each caSe*    It appears to me expedient that if licence fees are to be imposed they should be at a uniform rate ftfr all commodities, and&quot;that the fees to be levied at the outset should&quot;be laid 4own definitely in the Act and should be var&amp;aJble only be legislation.    A uniform rate would admittedly not in all oases prevent inequality between persons refused licences and those to whom licenses were granted but it would go a oonsi&amp;erable way to correct any such inequality and &quot;it would have great administrative advantages0    If this oourse be adapted I suggest that the licence &quot;fee should be at the rate of 331$ on the value of the imported goodac 3Ih3 appended Bill is prepared on these lines&quot;and is very short.    It prohibits importation for a period of ten years of all the commodities specified in the Schedule, It gives the Board of Trade power to grant licences on payment of a fee of an amount equal to&quot;33 l/3$ &quot;oi; the value of the goods specified in the license or such otneo: amount as Parliament may from time, to time determines&quot;   ^nis latter provision meets any Objection to fixing the aaount of the&quot; fee for a long term of years and.&apos; leaves Parliament free to vary or remove the licence fee at any time by the Annual finance Act or otherwise^The Bill also empowers the $oard of Trade to $et up Advisory Committees of manufacturers and users to advise them on the administration of the licensing systenrinv respect of an? of the goods or any class of thevgoods feo which the Bill relates.     The Bofrd would, of oourse, nave power to do so without any provision in the Ac ft;but itrappears to m    to be expedient that the- intention to do- so should: .. be definitely indicated in the 3ill*    Provision is also made &quot;in the Bill for drawbacks in the case of the jdcenoe of goods which are re-exported and for excepting goo^s in transit from the provisions of the Bill. - ...In view of the dangers/from ,the present $tate of un-oertainty it is of great importance that a deofsion should be taken and an announcement as to the polioy oti the Govern-ment made at the earliest possible datei19th June, 1920*
