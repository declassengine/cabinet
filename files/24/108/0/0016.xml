%p7r: -   - ; Statistical Statement for Month of May 1920.SECRET.CP. 1 &amp;15MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;The rate of import during May enabled the stocks of the principal foodstuffs to be generally maintained or increased. Although the arrivals of meat were again heavy, there was a welcome reduction of the stocks figure, which reflects the increased rate of consumption of imported mutton. Home supplies of meat, however, were very low, so that the increase in the total consumption of meat was small.     &quot;;The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on June 1st again show a considerable increase in average retail food prices, the percentage increase&apos; since July, 1914, rising from 140*2 on May 1st to 155 &quot;0 on June 1st. The increase was entirely accounted for by the rise in the price of sugar; prices of eggs and potatoes advanced, but these were more than balanced by decreases in milk and butter.Table A.
