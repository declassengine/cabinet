A summary of the proceedings of the Conference will be issued next week.The firm attitude taken by.the Government in the meeting Utththe National Union of Railwaymen has had a salutary effeot. It is unlikely that the Trade Union Congress will favour direct action on behalf of Ireland or Soviet Russia, and even if it did the support it would receive from the great body of workers would be negligible.There are no signs of improvement in the industrial situation as regards labour, but the new demands of the more important Unions will probably not be put forward for two or three weeks.A settlement of the gas workers&apos; claims has not yet been reached.Details are given of the agenda for the Annual Conference of the National Union of Railwaymen, which are interesting.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has formed a Communist Party of her own. She is now trying to obtain a visa for Norway with a view of reaching Moscow if possible.The Congress of the Third International is to be held at Moscow on July 30th.
HQJL ti1 t)TH3 RjILMBggThe agenda for the Annual. General meeting of the National union&apos;of Railwaymen, which will be held in the Co-operative Hall, Belfast, on July 5th - 10th, covers a variety of Interesting points.WagesThe Executive Committee announces that it has issued a circular setting out the findings of the National WageB Board and requests branches to instruct their delegates as to rejection or acceptance.Briton fferry Branch moves j&quot;That the Executive Committee be instructed to give notice to terminate immediately the recent settlement upon standardisation and open up negotiations for an improved scheme, leaving the bifeic rate to &quot;be determined as and when necessity demands.&quot;Covent Garden Branch moves:&quot;That, in view of the constant increase in the cost of living during the last 20 years (which increase has in no way been met by a corresponding increase in wages), and seeing that  4.10s. per week is the minimum upon which a railwayman can live and keep a family upon, with any degree of comfort, and without making any allowance for luxuries, we decide to forward a demand to the Ministry of\ Transport for an&apos; increase of 5s. per day for all our adult members employed on railways, and request a . reply from the Ministry by July 26th.   We further decide that in the event of the demand not being&apos;   conceded by the above date, the General Secretary shall arrange for this body to meet on July 27th in order to consider the matter again.&quot;Public ^Enquiry , .Five, branches demand that a &quot;public court of enquiry into the ramifications of railways&quot; be held, Crewe Ho. 2Branch adding &quot;with the object of establishing for allrailwayman a minimum rate of 16s. per day.&quot;PensionsFourteen branches demand a revised national pension scheme, the amounts asked varying from  2 -  3.10. per week, or two-thirds of the rate of the highest grade inwhich/
which retiring members have been employed. Sunday WorkFive branches move resolutions or amendments dealing with Sunday work, advocating the payment of double time, and reduction of Sunday work or .its abolition  &quot;except in oases of the greatest emergency.&quot; Advisory CommitteeBriton Ferry and Swansea Mo.. 1 Branch move;&quot;That the Executive Committee be instructed to give notice to the Government and the Managemei Committee of the railways, to terminate immediatel; the Advisory Committee agreement, and work for nationalisation with joint control for the good of the community, and not for dividend receivers.Mr. J.H. Thomas. MJ?. ...    .  - j. Klrkcalfly Branch submits the. ,&apos;f oil owing resolution!&quot;That, this Congress decides this is an opportl time to review the line of conduct adopted by the! General Secretary, Mr.&apos;J.H; Thomas, before, during] and after the recent national strike.   This COngre notes that during the months immediately preceding ,   tho strike Mr.&apos;Thomas was ever active advising the membership of this union on tho need for increased production and the folly of direct action, i/foile, . the other hand, he utterly failed to warn thorn of the Government&apos;s obvious plot; then maturing, to launch a sudden attack on our organisation, with t intent to break it up.&quot;This Congress also notes that during the str Mr. Thomas went around protesting that we had no intentions of pulling down the Government, and imploring other unions from coming to our assistam what time the said Government was organising every possible means, legal and illegal alike, to crush our union beyond repair.&quot;This Congress further notes that, following! the so-called satisfactory settlement of the strike Mr. Thomas failed to press the great moral victory achieved by the rank and file; but instead, fritter away both time and opportunity, until ultimately he attempted to stampede a Special Congress of this Union into unqualified acceptance of an utterly unsatisfactory soheme of standardisation on the average. ...... . , ! ...      . i&quot;In view of the situation provided by these repeated failures of fcr. Thomas, this Congress deiaei that the Right. Hon. Gentleman forthwith resign his official connection with this Union.&quot;Amendment/
Amendment by Cardiff Mo., 1 Branch;&quot;That the last paragraph be deleted.&quot; Administration of the UnionThroe resolutions refer to the &quot;conditions of affairs at Unity House&quot;; demand an enquiry into the administration, of the Union and suggest setting up six departments: locomotive and carriage, traffic, goods  and cartage, engineering, shop workers, supervisors and clerks, with officers responsible to the Executive Committee.Clerkenwell opposes the attitude of the Executive Committee to the question of proposed working arrangements between the National Union of Eailwaymen and the was of opinion that the best method was for members to join Co-operative Societies as individuals. Increased fare3Three branches oppose or condemn the attitude of the Executive Committee in supporting the Bill of the London Electric Railways.The names of 57 delegates are given as having been appointed &quot;to attend the ConferenceHOUSING QffBSTIOHGlasgow is still the centre of agitation against the Increase in Rent (Restrictions) Bill, and a national Conference of Labour end Co-open-tive organisations will meet on July 31st to decide the date of the 24 hours&apos; strike.   Support is being given to the Scottish Labour Housing Association by nearly all the Labour bodies in Scotland, of whom many are pledged to pay no inoreaseCo-operative Wholesale Society.   The Executive Committeewhatever/
whatever.-   The agitation., has&apos;&quot;been so well organised that serious developments may follow the passing of the 1 B113,.   The Association is now turning-its attention to the north of England.   In Manchester the Moss Side tenants Defence league is reported to have seized twenty houses, in which thirty-five families have been placed.   Two City Councillors, Mr. Hales and1 Mr. Hart, are carrying, on the campaign, and on June 22nd an ox-soldier and his family were installed in a house in Oxford Street, Manchester.   Another house in ISverton Road was visited with the same object, but the landlord agreed to accept the man as a tenant.   Before taking possession, it is Mr. Halee&apos; cuetorn.to make a speech to passers by and gain their approval.In Warwick building is much delayed by the shortage of bricklayers, who prefer to work at Coventry or Kenilworth at a higher district wage.   In Rugby the delay is due to the shortage of carpenters, and in each case the Unions have prohibited overtime though the men were willing to work.   My correspondent reports that in Leicester some non-Unionist builders are working ten hours a day on private contract and laying 1,000 bricks.The London Labour Party has announced that Tenants&apos; Snquiry -Bureaux are opened at Camber veil, Chelsea, Doptfi Hampstead, Holborn, Westminster and Woolwich. : Mr. Hertei Morrison is the organiser of these Bureaux, which appear I; to give legal advice on housing matters. /The Building Guild idea is gaining ground.   The Rhymney Valley Guild has completed the,arrangement for the-erection of 4,000 houses at an estimated cost of  3,600,000, and Barrow is proposing to start a scheme on Guild lines.   The growth of this movement must be watched with great interest, because if the workers find that/
that they can successfully run the building trade they are sure to wish to try their hand at other industries.TR3 &quot;RJUSS, Cg? RUSSIA&quot; IrlQVDMSMTThe &quot;monster&quot; demonstration in Orosvenor Square last, Sunday was a failure.   Something under 300, largely aliens, stood under umbrellas for some time to listen to speeches from SiessVsi. I*yh&apos;ch and&apos; iialbrio, li..P.&apos;, -&quot;David Rwasfly, Hodgson, Hease and Mrs. Hughes.   On the previous evening Malone made a speech which was a covert incitement to violence.   It may be doubted, even if tho day had been fine, if the workers of London would have come &quot;in their thousands&quot;, though the invitation was signed by,Tom nann, D. Carmichael, Oeorge Lanstmry and BV, H. Peet.   It is stated that another Monster&quot; meeting will he held on July 4th, but one of the organisers has privately expressed the opinion that no more meetings will be held for the time being.Extremists in this oountry *re looking forward to the forthcoming Congress of the Third International at Moscow. The agenda are not yet available, but it is believed that an attempt will be made to weed out tfte half-hearted so as to leave a residue of vio^ont revolutionaries as a nucleus.The British Labour Delegation to Russia will return by the end of the month.   According to the Moscow wireless, f, which is not always distinguished for accuracy, Mr, Robert Williams has received the Soviet Military Uedal and hafc been makiiig: very violent speeches.   When put to the tes,t, however, in this country he has seldom had the courage of what he is pleased to call his convictions, vSOUTH WAI^S mjjjgS!-A split between the&apos; South Vfoles minors JToderatioip. and the Iliners&apos; Federation of Great Britain seems less likely than was the case a few woeks ago, as the officials/
officials have organised extensive propaganda in favoi of increased contributions which seems likely to resit in a reversal of the previous ballot on the question,At the recent conference a resolution was passed to the effect that the miners&apos; notice of the total abolition of piece work by all grades in the coalfield be tendered.   A ballot is to be taken on the question and the result will in all probability favour the reso The only men who would be,seriously affected are coalh and tirabermen who are outnumbered by the other workers,A correspondent who has just returned from thecoalfield sends the following report:&quot;The only points likely to lead to serious local disputes at present are, payment for 1 small coalT and for Stoppages caused by circumstances not under workmen1s control&apos;, and for wet work.&quot;At the ports coal trimmers and tippers are only working about sixteen hours a week owing to t restrictions upon export, and their earnings compared, with tho.se of normal times are very small if this continues&apos;- there is certain to be some sectional trouble; beyond this the new arrangement -  made tc bring all matters in dispute to a central office for discussion between employers and men is likely to ease the labour position at Bristol Channel ports.&quot;Sections of Steel Workers are being worried a good deal by the General Workers1 Union, whijh does not appear to have any.real grievance in any of the moves put forward-, and the moves seem to be for the purpose of forcing non-union men to join, or for advertisement.&quot;MISS SYLVIA PAHRURST AND.THB CQMtCTIST PARTY.Hiss Silvia Pahkhurst formed a Communist Party of her own at tho International Socialist Club on June 19th, She was^supported by members of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, representatives from tho Social Soviets at llanchester, Sheffield, Norwich and ISxeter, by MaoManus, Btfcl and P&amp;ul (recently expelled from the Socialist labou iParty) and by Davies, who has just resigned the secretaryship/
ship of the South Wales Socialist Society.   13. Whitehead, who is running, the -Labour .Abstentionist Party4 and Thurgood, the secretary of the Social Soviet movement, were also present.   The former was appointed temporary secretary,   . while the latter is to keep in touch with his duties so-that he can take them over if necessary.   A provisional committee was set up, to function for three months.   Apart from Miss Pankhurst and Eden and Cedar Paul, all the members are manual workerk.   &quot;The Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is to be&apos; .v;   \&apos;:&apos;\   -I /*- f f,,   . &quot; ithe organ of the Party,   Miss Pankhurst will retain the editorship, but a &quot;Committee of Control&quot; will take charge of the paper.It is quite clear from these details that, the new &quot;Communist Party&quot; is merely the Workers Socialist Pederotion under another name and that Miss Pankhurst has taken this action because any joint movement of the three negotiating bodies would put her into the background.The United Communist P;;,rty was to have been formed at the National -Rank and,Pile Convention at the beginning of August and Miss PankhurstTs action, must inevitably lead to more recrimination between the extreme societies.Miss Pankhurst has applied to the Norwegian Authorities for a visa to visit friends in Norway.   Her real object is to attend the secret meeting of the Third International in Christiania next week and then to get into Soviet Russia, probably by the Northern route, which is quite passable at this time of the year.   She has devoted two pages of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; to- a &quot;Constitution for British Soviets&quot;, which covers the whole of our social organisation., It Is probably written to impress Lenin and to persuade him to entrust her with funds.Miss Pankhurst and her partners, being in serious financial/
financial difficulties, have borrowed money and intend now to discharge their liabilities by issuing to their creditors, in satisfaction of their claims, fully paid shares in the Agenda Press limited.YORKSHIREMy correspondent sends the following report regardingpropaganda in his area, which may be taken as typical of thecountry as a whole:-&quot;Small open air meetings at street corners and opon spaces by the various socialist and Labour bodies have been in full swing all over this area during the   I past week, and bigger gatherings were held during.the  I week end.&quot;In addition to the local agitators, Rev. Gordon Lang of the Monmouth Independent Labour Party has common a fortnights mission at Leeds and Bradford and J.T. We] Hewbold has addressed meetings of soap workers recently on strike at Leeds and of printing engineers at EeighlejJ&quot;During the week-end Mr. J* Mills, M.P., Mr.. J. Davison, M.P., and Mr. F, 0. Roberts, M.P. addressed a I Labour Demonstration at Hull, and Commander Kenworthy spoke at a Hull Brotherhood Meeting on &quot;Revolution&quot; and! presided at a local Zionist meeting.&quot;The audiences have been fairly good and the j promoters of the various meetings express themselves aflj very satisfied with the support they are getting, the I additions to the members list and the sale of literaturl&quot;The Rev. Gordon Lang has been pitching his plat- 1 forms in the side streets and has been preaching classl hatred to crowds of women folk from neighbouring houses! blaming the Government for high prices, and generally speaking his arguments have boon very well received. In addition to the usual propaganda he has read extracts from the Press about Ascot &apos;where the idlers and parasites, who tell the workers to work harder and produce more arid kick up a, terrific row if they should take a half-day off to see a football or cricket match, squander the results of the.labours of the workers&apos;.   Re urged that the ruling classes of this country are getting ready to embark upon further wars M of, conquest in Persia and Mesopotamia and that the workers should refuse to fight. ,Russia, Ireland and various domestic topics have been well worked.up..&quot;Newbold had a good crowd at Eelghley, a printing engineering centre, and made a clever speech on the ramifications of international finance, trusts and combines and how men like Lord Leverholme and firms like J. k P. Coats had interests in German^, Russia, India a^A other places and were in a position I to control the Government.Commander/ I
&quot;In the course of his address on devolution&apos;, Commander Kenworthy told his Brotherhood audience at Hull that he had deliberately chosen that subject as so much was being said about it in private to-day everywhere, whereas frank discussion in public was avoided.   Mr. Kenworthy said he believed a revolution was necessary but owing to the level headedness of the British people and the strength of the Trade Union movement, and to the fact that even the most extreme men did not want bloodshed or suffering, he&apos; was of opinion that the change would come about peace-fully and with very little suffering.   Mr. lenworthy put in his usual good word for the Bolshevik regime and the desirability of leaving Russia alone to work out her own government and so on.&quot;UraCPXOYMMT MONO $2-SERVICE MSHThere is reported to be serious unemployment among ex-Service men in the Midlands.   In Nottingham the situation is grave, as 2,000 men are out of work; there is much talk of a march to London to interview the Prime Minister,The Bristol men also expect to come to London this week.It is reported that the Boot and Shoe Union in Leicester, which has done good work in training disabled men, has refused to continue this work, owing to unemployment in the industry.the co-operative movement ahd the trapes umiouThe 1,270 delegates of the Woman&apos;s Co-operative Guild, who met at Derby last week, decided by an overwhelming majority to support the alliance with Labour.   The membership is 44,000,ivry: Yorkshire correspondent reports in his area that the-struggle; botwoon -Labour and&apos; anti-Labour oo-bperatives has &quot;already b&amp;gun. &quot;the-latter have the-upper hand at tho moment, b;ut will probably be finally outnumbered.&apos;   My Coventry correspondent states that the extremists in his area are working hard .to secure the amalgamation with -tfeir Co-operative Societies on whose mbney they naturally have designs.   He oonsiders&apos; it essential that the^ordinary co-operators should have their eyes opened as in their present/-   apathetic/
apathetic-state there is danger that the control of the Society will pass out of their hands,SHORTAGE OF ENGLISH MEATMy correspondents lay stress on the discontent caused by the scarcity of English meat,.   It has been unobtainable in Newcastle during the last two weeks and the working classes allege that the farmers are withholding their live stock until control is abolished.SALE OF REVOLUTIONARY L ITERAftUREThe avidity with which sections of the working classe now buy extreme literature is evidenced by the progress of the Reformers&apos; Bookstall, Glasgow.   Pounded in 1907, under the auspices of the local Independent Labour Party the bookstall was kept going with great difficulty for some years.   Although the paid up capital only amounts to  312. 5. 0, the turnover in 1919 was  7,000.   The bookstall is run by a management committee of the Independent Labour Party which holds shares to the value of  168. 10. 0.THE LABOUR HEWS service the Labour News Service is following in the steps of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in that it has published a stolen official doouraent. . Two confidential memoranda, dealing with the instruction of the police in the use of pistols, have been reprinted, in extenso, by the Service, under the heading &quot;Militarising the Police&quot;, and have already been copied by the &quot;Railway Review&quot;, &quot;The Crusader&quot;, &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot;, and &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot;.   &quot;The Labour Leader.&apos;! and the &quot;Woolwioh Pioneer?&apos; also give the substance of the memoranda.&apos; MR./
f ,It is reported that the speeches of Mr. Maione are not arousing the same interest as heretofore; he appears to be associating with the lowest class of street orator &quot;and to be borrowing their stock phrases.   His orations now include abuse of any person,of position in the country en d he states t hat.the. pnly way to ob tain progress is by violence.   He ?/aves aside any opposition to his remarks end informs his audience that the interrupter is a paid agent.,SIM FEIN Iff GREAT BRITAINAt Irish meetings held in the London area during the week the chief subject of discussion has been the attitude of the Government to.the Irish railway strikers. Sinn Feiners are making every effort to arouse sympathy among British Trade Unions, but there is no evidence of success.   The,great body of the workers are weary of Ireland and the likelihood of sympathetic action on a large scale is remote.. The railwaymen say that theirs is not the only union.concerned., whereas the Labour leaders are passing the responsibility on to the forthcoming Trades Union Congress.   The evidence at present available points to the probability that this Congress will decide against direct action for political : purposes.   Failing unforeseen developments, a decision in the reverse sense would have the support of the extremists only.   Their.weekly Income is still the paramount interest of the average British working man and of his wife.An &quot;Irish Debating Society&quot; has recently beenformed/
formed in London, the officers being: President, Thomas 0&apos;Sullivan; Vice-President, Brian 0&apos;iCennedy; Treasurer, Miss Connolly; Eon. Secretary, R. Whel&amp;n. The object of this society is said to be &quot;to provide speakers in connection with all phases of the Irish movement and to expose English misrepresentation and calumny in reference to Ireland&quot;.Mrs. Sheohy Skeffington has been making her usual violent speeohesy fco; considerable audiences in Lancashire. On June 20th she. was presented with a case of cutlery by the local Irish in the South Yorkshire coalfield. Priests were much in evidence at her meetings and this probably kept many Protestants away.The James Connolly Sinn Pein Club, Glasgow, has sent  25 for the Irish railway strike and the Irish Labour Party  3.10.0. &quot;A new branch of Sinn Eein was opened in Lanark lastweek by the James Connolly Club, Glasgow.   Eighty nameswere handed in for membership.   Twenty-two delegates of scottish Sinn Fein branches met at Bellshill on 17th Juns.The Motherwell delegate named Jennings reported thatthey were well off for small arms and ammunition, andintimated that after contributing liberally to general headquarters in Ireland they still had a balance of as 130.   The undermentioned figures were given/representingthe strength of the Volunteers in the districts named:-Blantvre 150Burnbank and Hamilton 570Uddingntflfc end district 460Camberslang and Rutherglen 540Motherwell, Shotts and Wiehaw 900Coatbridge and district 700Shettleston and Baillieston 130Total    3,550One of the Glasgow Sinn Fein Treasurers-robbed hissociety of  29 during the last year, thus curtailing
- 18 -i .....138the money sent to Ireland.   He is now paying hack the amount at the rate of 10s, per week.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is publishing under such headings as &quot;Brazen Bolshies Bestial Brutality - Beds v. Rosaries&quot;, disgraceful articles and comments oh Irish matters.     . *irslmp,There has been no change in the condition of the Provinces, during the past week.   Indictable offences totalled 192; of these 141 were directly attributable, to Sinn Fein, 23 were of an agrarian nature, and the remaining 28 were serious crimes affecting the state of the country. Five oases of arson were reported.The fierce rioting of a party nature which broke out in the City of Londonderry on June 19th may possibly extend to Belfast and other Northern towns.There is considerable anxiety as to the outcome of the situation.created by the&apos;railwaymon1s refusal to handle munitions and stores.   Instances occurred during the week of railway employees refusing to run trains in which military and police were among the passengers;   This may create a very   difficult situation and the reported threat of the Government to close down the Irish lines is widely disoussed.   It may be that if trains cease to run the lines will be subjected to damage at the hands of the Irish Volunteers in order to prevent trains being run by soldiers.The Labour trouble continues to agitate the minds of many of the business section of the community and the general belief is that English Labour will give no assistance to the Irish Bailwaymen in their refusal not only to carry munitions but also soldiers and police.   English Labour representatives see clearly that they are not trusted by irish/
Irish Trade Unionists and in recent conferences when representatives from both countries met Englishmen were asked to withdraw when purely Irish matters were being discussed.   Englishmen felt this so keenly that some of them returned to England before the business was actually finished.   It is. therefore, likely that if a crisis arises at present in Ireland Irish labour must fight alone.The people not directly connected with the Hallway workers are becoming very anxious Over the possibility of trouble and foresee a disaster to the commercial community should the Government close down the railways.   Hot only will the ordinary business be brought to a standstill but rioting end injury to property is feared.
