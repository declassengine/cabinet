roS^DO^^^S^gHR. j^gFKRTY. OF KIS BRCTATOfl MAJES1Tf GOVERMEM J^FIDENTIAL &apos;       .HOUSING.Grants&apos; to Private. Buil4ers*H,20.Progress under the scheme for assisting the provisionof houses by the grant of subsidies to private builders is beingseriously retarded owing to the limited period for which Government assistance is at present available.Under the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919, subsidy may only be paid in respect of houses which are completed within12 months from 23rd December 1919, or in special cases withinI have received numerous representations from the National Federation of House Builders and from manufacturers and private persons who are contemplating building, that owing to difficulties in obtaining materials and labour they cannot be certain of completing schemes within the stated time,   -The consequence is that prospective builders decide either to restrict the number of houses they propose to build or refrain from building altogether.It is probable that under existing conditions the amount of building within the year laid down in the. Act will fall far short of exhausting the  15,000,000 authorised by Parliament.I propose therefore without varying theamount of* 15,000,000 that the period shou Id be extended by one years. Legislation vail be necessary but if I am able to make an announcement that the Government propose to extend the period I am satisfied that a large number of schemes will proceed and that many persons will take advantage of the present building weather and start at once.I shall be glad therefore If my colleagues will ccnrsr In this proposal, the principle of which has been accepted by the Housing Committee4a further period of 4 months.C,.ADDX3T)N. 23, 6v 20*Ilinfstiy of Health.
