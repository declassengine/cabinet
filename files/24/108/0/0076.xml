I have formed the conclusion that it is no longer ntcees&amp;ry to circulate the special Weekly Cabinet Report (marked &apos;Secret&apos;) entitled &quot;The Labour Situation;&quot; and I have given a direction to my Department that in future Part I of-&apos;,v-&apos;.i     : &apos; .   &apos; -i : / -the ordinary printed Weekly Report of the Ministry of Labour, -which is also entitled &quot;The Labour Situation,&quot; should be so re-arranged as to provide my colleagues with a brief and concise summary of the more important Labour topics of the week.    Part II of this 7eekly Report is mainly departmental in character and need only be read by those of my colleagues who wish to acquaint themselves with the work of my Department in greater detail.Large issues of importance arising in the Labour world from time to tine will form the subject of special reportsthat will be circulated to the Cabinet as necessary.*In making this change I have kept equally in view the convenience of my colleagues as well as the interests of administrative economy.conpiwtcxal;CABI.N3T.THE) LABOUR SITUATION (llLY REPORT). flbtc by the Minister of.
