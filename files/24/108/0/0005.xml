PARAPHRASE TBLBGrRAM from the Govx ernor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. - i(Received Colonial Offioe 8*0 p*me 13th June 1920)m ii* ^ c-t a    w k f-&apos; wi m iw ro ni12th June.   With reference to your telegram of 1st June correspondence with League of Nations.    Foilowing from my Prime Minister begins.    I agree that there should be previous consultation and harmonization between the British members of the League on doubtful or controversial issues involved (in) correspondence with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.    But important considerations are involved in the machinery for such consultation and the channel of o.omraunioation with the League and these oould only be properly dealt with at some future Imperial Conference such as that on constitutional relations.    I have great difficulty about the suggestion that the Dominions should use as an intermediary channel of communication a branch of the Imperial Cabinet Secretariat and would prefer that the whole subject should stand over for settlement at ,such a Conference especially as I do not anticipate that any controversial or (doubtful) issues are likely to be (discussed) with the League at an earlyydate* Ends*BUXTON.
