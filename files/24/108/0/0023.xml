Read for the time being of the Government concerned, and no attempt has&apos; been made by the Sec-retariat, even when it was clear that the subject-matter of a particular letter or other&apos;document fell within the sphere of a particular Ministry, to send it direct to that Ministry, since it was feared that to do so^ though it might in some oases obviate delays, would in other cases prove inconvenient to the Governments concernediA certain number of the Members represented on the Council have established an office to act as a centre of distribution and co-ordination in regard to correspondence, reports, etc., received from or sent to the International Secretariat.   This, hoy/ever,, has not yet been done&apos;by all Members of the Council, and by only one or two of the other Members of the League,, As a consequence, a certain number of cases have occurred in which papers have been seriously held up, and even, in a few instances, altogether mislaid.The number of documents, etc., concerned is even at this early stage by no means negligible..   It has amounted since Jan-uary last&quot;to ovor 100 despatched to all Members of the league, and, in the case of States represented on the Council, to a much larger figure,I therefore have the honour to ask whether Your ExcellencyTs Government might perhaps see its way. to the establishment of an office to fulfil the function above described,..   It was suggested in a previous communication that relations between the Seoiet-ariat and the Government of a Member not represented on theCouncil might perhaps be best organised through&apos; the intermediary of one of the delegates sent by that Member to the Assembly,- The present suggestion is in no way in contradiction to that plan, inasmuch.as it would be open to any Government so to organise, the proposed office as to make it capable of acting as a secretariat for its delegation to the Assembly,&quot;both during the meeting of the Assembly and permanently,., should it so desirea
I should he most grateful to be informed at the earliest possible date of the vievir taken b^; Your Excellency1 s Government of the proposal above set forth; and, should such an office as I suggest eventually be created, if I might be put into touch with it at the earliest possible moment. &quot; In that event, it might be desirable for the person in charge of the office to visit, at his convenience, the headquarters of the League, and beoome acquainted with&apos; the organisation and personnel of the International Secretariat.I have the honour to be,Your Excellences obedient Servant, (Signed).
