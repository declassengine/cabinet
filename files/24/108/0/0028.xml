......Referred to r&quot; *       cp, 1 526    Y      Committee of Home Affair8 dD-OOT^EN^TSTtHE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTT1 S.-.(K3fvlMdSOT.MriUtl\S,Ul! Milk and Dairies Bill. M.H.20.Memorandum by the Minister of Health as to payment   ,of licence&quot;fees.I desire to submit for the consideration of my colleagues a point which has arisen in connection with the &apos; (II?     Milk and Dairies Bill.^ ,From communications received from Local Authorities it became apparent that there would be a demand for an Exchequer grant in aid of the expenditure falling upon local rates in connection with the inspection of da^ry herds and farms.    Conferences were therefore held with the Treasury end.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, as a result of which it was agreed that provision should be made for the charging of licence fees to dairy farmers, and subject thereto the Treasury &quot;concurred in an undertaking being given to ask Parliament to meet by an Exchequer grant one half of any deficit incurred by local authorities on the licensing arrangements&quot;.    They expressed the view that &quot;it would not be imposing an unfair burden on the Milk Trade to require the whole cost of the licensing system to be met from fees&quot;, and that &quot;the inevitable tendency will be for the burden to be passed on to the consumer, who will benefit from the improvement of the milk supply1&apos;.    They realized, however, that it would be impossible to guarantee, that the fees would be adequate to meet expenditure of every local authority, and for that reason were, prepared to authorise the statement in regard to the grant in aid of any deficit.The representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture expressed the opinion that the charging of fees would make the Bill less acceptable to farmers, but they did not dissent
from the principle.,- -and accordingly words- were. Inserted-, in&apos; the- -Bill to enable an Order dealing with licensing to provide for the charging of fees.i understand that on further consideration the Minister of Agriculture takes the view that &quot;the proposal will meet with very strong opposition in Parliament and cannot well be   defended.My own view is that the principle can and ought to he defended.     There is precedent for the charging of fees in connection with existing systems of licensing &quot;instituted in the public interest.    Dairy farmers them-selves in the County of London (they are of course few in number) are required to be licensed and to pay a fee.I do not think it would be right on principle to look to the Exchequer for a contribution if the , producer, who in the long run will benefit by a system of inspection, licensing and grading, is to contribute nothing.     On the other hand, the councils of Agricultural counties will be incurring expenditure largely for the protection of consumers in urban centres, the whole of which cannot fairly be allowed to fall on the County nates.The scale and amount of the fees would have to be settled in consultation with the interests concerned and would have a direct relation to the amount of inspection considered to be necessary and practicable, but the farmer can well afford to pay something, and should in my opinion be required to do so.The matter Is one of urgency as the Bill was introduced on the lOth May, and it will be necessary to take 2nd Reading at an early date.C. ADDISON. 24.6.20.Ministry of Health. 2.
