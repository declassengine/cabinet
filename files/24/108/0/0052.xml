Note addressed to the President of the German Peace Commission in Paris by the Conference of Ambassadors (at Paris) on behalf of the Supreme Council, as a result of the Boulogne Conference of 22nd June, 1920.A. APPRECIATION OF THE SITUATION BY THE INTER-ALLIED MILITARY COMMISSION OF CONTROL, 19th JUNE, 1920.The following are extracts from the reports of the Sub-Commissions of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control regarding the general execution of the military Articles of the Peace Treaty : 1. Report by the Armaments Sub-Commission.Major-General the Hon. Sir F. R, Bingham reports as follows : &quot; I cannot put my finger on any definite violation of the Treaty, as regards the disarmament clauses, with the exception of the small incidents alluded to under Article 168, viz., the manufacture of 77-mm. guns at Essen ; and under Article 169, tne destruction by the German Government of war material between the I Oth January and the 10th March.Generally speaking, the disarmament clauses are being carried out. In my opinion, however, a state of internal chaos is preventing the disarmament being carried out as fully and as quickly as it would be if law and order prevailed in the country.So far as the German Government itself is concerned, and the people themselves, I believe they are anxious to carry out the disarmament clauses quickly, but as regards(B20/290)   100  6/20  h&amp;s  8326wo
the military party, they undoubtedly snatch at any interpretation of a clause which appears to favour their point of view, and which will allow them to increase the armament over and above that authorized.Destruction, of war material is being carried out under the supervision of the different district committees into which the Armament Sub-Commission is organized, and while progress was very slow at the beginning, it is now improving. The German * authorities have been and are still hoping for a larger army than the 100,000 men, and it is this, and a natural disinclination to give&apos; up their arms, which have caused the progress up to the present to have been slow. It has to be remembered that owing, first, to the Auslieferungsfrage (surrender of German officers) and then to the general strike and rebellion, at least six weeks&apos; work has been lost.The following four points must be held to, if the questions arise at the Spa Conference : (i.) The guns they are proposing to keep for the fortresses must be surrendered.(ii.) No obstacles must be placed in the way of the work of the Control Commission, and the duty of the German liaison officers is to assist the Commission in its work, and not to hinder it; the right to go where they like and when they like, as laid down in Article 205, must be insisted on for the members of the Commission.(iii.) The rifles, machine guns, &amp;c, now in the country must be discovered and handed over.(iv.) A law must be brought in at once preventing the export of war material, and the Germans must establish the strictest control on their ports to prevent this traffic.&quot;2. Report by the Effectives Sub-Commission.The German Government has made an effort to carry out the reduction of its armed forces.The measures taken are not exactly in accordance with Articles 160 and 163 of the Peace Treaty, but in principle they give satisfaction on the following points : (a.) The disbandment of the old army.(6.) The formation of an army of 200,000 men (the German Government reported that the army would be reduced to this strength by the 15th May, and on the 10th June issued a statement by Wireless Press to the effect that this had been done and the forces in the neutral zone reduced to 10 battalions, 5 squadrons and 1 battery); in the matter of staffs and organization, however, this force does not comply exactly with the provisions of the Peace Treaty.The German Government has also issued orders for the dissolution and disarmament of the unauthorized reserve formations [Einwohnerwehren and Zeitfreiwilligen).The dissolution of the Einwohnerwehren is meeting with very strong opposition in the country, particularly in Bavaria, and there is no evidence to show that the measures of disarmament and disbandment are likely to prove effective.General Nollet has written to the German Government demanding (i.) The formulation of proposals for the surrender of the arms of the Einwohnerwehreu.(ii.) Information as to the measures taken by the German Government to give effect to its decision of 8th April to suppress the Einwohnerwehren.On the other hand, nothing has so far been done to bring the police forces into conformity with the Peace Treaty, and to change the military characteristics of the Sicherheitspolizei ; on the contrary, this force is being further developed.No effort has yet been made to satisfy Article 211 of the Treaty, which demands that German laws should be brought into harmony with the military clauses of the Peace Treaty.A letter from the German Government to the Commission of Control, dated 5th May, states, however, that a new Reichswehr law has been submitted to the Reichsrat, which formally suppresses all former military laws, including compulsory service.

Repoet by the Fortifications Sub-Commission.The Fortifications Sub-Commission was completely organized with the whole machinery of control ready to supervise the immediate execution of the Articles of the Peace Treaty concerned, on the 10th January, 1920.Although 5 months have elapsed since &apos; that date, to all intents and purposes the real work of dismantling has not yet been begun by the German authorities, although disarmament is practically completed. ,The putting in hand of the work has been delayed by quibbling over the legal interpretation of certain Articles of the Peace Treaty, involving the questions of &quot;recording&quot; and &quot;dismantling&quot; of fortifications,The general attitude of the German authorities seems to be well calculated to delay the execution of the Articles concerned. It appears to be one of passive obstruction, yielding gradually under pressure, and consuming time. It results that, as far as can be foreseen, the complete execution of the Articles in question is unlikely before the end of this year ; and it is certain that it is not possible for them to carry out the work of dismantling the Rhine fortresses, in the unoccupied territory east of the Rhine, by the date on which the work is due for completion (l 0th July), under Article 180 of the Peace Treaty.Decisions of the Supreme Council at Boulogne, 22nd June, 1920.The following decisions of the Supreme Council are given in Appendix IV. (A.):  (i.) Decision regarding German disarmament and the reduction of the German Army to 100,000 ; also regarding the German Police and the export of war material.(ii.) Decision regarding the sale of surrendered German war material by the Reparations Commission,Appendix IV. (B.) contains the Note addressed to the German Peace Commission in Paris by the Conference of Ambassadors, communicating the decisions of (i.) above.
Article 42.-No Fortifications to be Maintained or Constructed West of a Line drawn 50 kilometres to the East of the Rhine.This is being&apos; complied with.   (See also Article 180.)Article 43-No Troops allowed in Neutral Zone. Permanent Works for Mobilization forbidden there. (Subsequently modified by Marshal Foch on 8th August, 1919, and 20 battalions, 10 squadrons and 2 batteries allowed ; this to be reduced to 10 battalions, 5 squadrons and 1 battery by the 10th June, and completely replaced by Police by the 10th July, 1920.)(a.) The portion of this Article which prohibits the upkeep of all permanent works for mobilization was allocated recently to the Fortiti cations Sub-Commission of Control, with a note from General Nollet instructing the Sub-Commission to prepare a list of the type of works which should be destroyed.The view of the British Section, supported by the legal opinion of Brigadier-General Morgan, was submitted through the President of the Fortifications Sub-Commission to General Nollet, that the Treaty does not authorize the destruction of these works, and the Commission could not call upon the German Government to undertake the destruction nor to incur the expense of removing or destroying such works. The Treaty only forbids &quot; upkeep,&quot; and the works must consequently fall into decay.General Nollet has forwarded a letter to the German Government stating that these works must disappear, either by destruction or by the removal of material, and requesting information about these works.(6.) On the 10th June the German Government issued the following statement by wireless press: &quot; The reduction of the German Army to 200,000 men has been accomplished. From to-day there are only 10 battalions, 5 squadrons, 1 battery,garrisoned in the 50-kilometre zone on the right bank of the Rhine, in accordance with the Versailles Treaty.&quot;The Commission of Control has since reported that these reductions have been effected.Decisions and Letters.1. Letter No. 590, dated 27th March, 1920, from General Nollet to Marshal Foch, stating that the Germans have been authorized to maintain 10,000 additional police in the neutral zone for 5 years from 10th April, 1920.   (Annexe No. 1.)2. Letter No.  790/1, dated 29th April, 1920, from Marshal Foch to General. Nollet, authorizing the maintenance of 20 battalions, 10 squadrons and 2 batteries in the neutral zone till 10th May, 1920.   This force to be progressively reduced and replaced by 10,000 police, 10th July, 1920.   (These are the same police as those, authorized in Annexe No. 1.)   (Annexe No. 2.)
Articles 159, 160, 163.-Demobilization and Reduction to 200,000 by 10th April and 100,000 (7 Infantry and 3 Cavalry Divisions) by 10th July.Article 159. Demobilization.-The German military forces have been progressively -demobilized and it does not appear that any units or formations of the old army of any military value exist. A considerable number of officers and men are, however, still borne on the strength of the demobilization offices and depots (Abwickelungs-dmter and -stellen). This personnel was, according to a note of the German Government, dated 28th January, to be &quot; demilitarized&quot; by 31st March. A regulation has been published in German &quot; Army Orders &quot; of 22nd March announcing that the officers and men so employed were to be &quot; discharged from army service &quot; on 9th April. The value of this regulation is dealt with under Article 173.Reduction.-(/Seeunder Articles 160 and 163.)Articles 160 and 163.-In virtue of these Articles, as modified in their operation by the resolution of the Supreme Council, the German Army should have been reduced to 200,000 effectives by .10th April. This was not done. In the opinion of the Effectives Sub Commission, the strength of the German Army (Reichswehr and Freikorps) on the 10th May was 270,000, exclusive of the personnel of the demobilization offices and dep6ts,   -An Army Order, dated 6th March, communicated to the Commission on 2nd April, purported to provide for the reduction of the German Army by 1st April to 8,475 officers, 207,538 other ranks (total 216,01b), an excess of 475 officers and of 15,538 other ranks over the numbers (8,000 officers, 192,000 other ranks) prescribed.*In reply to a request to be furnished with the actual number of effectives, a letter was received from General von Cramon undertaking that it shall be reduced to 200,000 by 15th May at latest.&quot;,On the 10th June the German Government issued a statement by Wireless Press to the effect that the reduction of the army to. 200,000 men had been accomplished.The Commission of Control has since reported that this reduction has been effected.Section (2) of Article I60.--Divisions&apos; and Army Corps&apos; headquarters are nominally organized in the army-order referred to, in accordance with the Treaty. Actually, there is little real similarity (sec under Section (3)).The number and strengths of the units of infantry, artillery, engineers technical, &amp;c, services and troops do not correspond with the table of the Peace Treaty. There is, in particular, an excess of infantry battalions, batteries and pioneer battalions.Section 3-The prohibition of the maintenance or formation of forces differently grouped or of other organizations for the command of troops has not been complied with : (a.) There are 14 Reichswehr brigade staffs.   These are forbidden.(b.) There are 9 cavalry brigade staffs.   These are are forbidden.(c.) There is a considerable excess of staffs of.&quot; divisional infantry&quot; and &quot; divisional artillery.&quot;The excess number of staffs amounts to 24,There are certain formations forbidden by the Treaty, e.g., heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns.(d.) The unauthorized reserve formations (Zeitfreiwilligen and Einwohnenvehren)&apos;\ have officially been disbanded by the German Government, and orders have been issued for their arms to be handed to the Sicherheitspolizei.   The* The excess over 200,000 represents the forces in the neutral zone which the Germans maintained should not be included in the 200,000 army.f The dissolution of the Zeitfreiwilligen was ordered for 31st March. A circular, dated 8th April, has been addressed by the German Government to all the States, ordering the dissolution of the Einwohnerwehren as prescribed by the Commission.
Organization for Preparation for War.*(a.) The Great General Staff appears to have been abolished, but is represented.by a Demobilization Office (Abwickelungsamt). Certain sections have been transferred to civil departments,(6.) The old Army Corps Headquarters are said to have been dissolved leaving nothing but their organs of demobilization. &apos; -(c.) The recruiting offices are stated to have been &quot; demilitarized&quot; and placed under a civil department to deal with pensions and claims of discharged soldiers.(d.) Administrative services. The number of officers employed in the Reichswehr-ministerium and in the administrations attached to it is stated by the German Government to be 440. This is well below the authorized number (300x2, i.e,, 600)., Some sections have, however, been transferred to civil departments, e.g., &quot; Q &quot; services to the Finance Ministry, Medical Services to the Ministry of Labour.Decisions and Letters.I. Note from Mr. Lloyd George to Herr Sthamer, dated 18th February, 1920. stating that the German Army was to be reduced to 200,000 by 10th April, 1920, and to 100,000 by 10th July, 1920.

Note to the German Peace Commission in Paris, communicating the decision in paragraph 10 above.   (Appendix IV. (B.).)Zeitfreiwilligen can be considered as definitely suppressed, but events alone will show if the suppression is genuine; the opposition throughout the country, particularly in Bavaria, to the disbandment of the Eimvohnerwehren is very great.
&quot; 1fit&apos;Article 161. -Administrative Services (civil personnel) to be reduced in each class to one-tenth of Establishment of Budget of 1913.Owing to the transfer of services referred to under Article 160,&apos;no reliable particulars are forthcoming as to civilian personnel.Article 162.-Number of employees or officials of German States, such as Customs Officers, Forest Guards and Coastguards not to exceed strength of 1913, and not to be assembled for military training. The number of police only to be increased in proportion to increase of population.The number of police exceeds the ratio laid down in this Article. Representations have been made by the German Government requesting an increase of 75 per cent, over the ratio prescribed in the Treaty.   This question is still under consideration. -The last clause of this Article, forbidding military training in the police, as also the second clause of the third section, of Article 160 forbidding the &quot;maintenance of forces differently grouped,&quot; is - violated by the recruiting, maintenance and training of the Sicherheitspohzei (now 60,000 strong).Exclusive of the Sicherheitspolizei, the strength of the police in territory remaining &quot;German was 80,000 in 1913, and is now 92,000.As regards the gendarmerie, their strength was 12,000 in 1913, and is 16,000 at present.   The question has been raised of increasing their strength to 17,000.Germany has no special coastgards, such duty being performed by Customs officers. &apos; The latter and the forest guards have no military organization. Their strength has not been communicated to the Commission.Decisions and Letters.1.

Note to the German Peace Commission in Paris, communicating the decision in paragraph 6 above.   (Appendix IY. (B.))Article 164.-Armament allowed to Germany until admitted as a Member of the League of Nations-for 100,000 Army.Owing to the alteration in the dates for the reduction of the German Army, and also to the late disturbances in the Ruhr district, it has not yet been reduced even to 200,000 men. Units are still being moved about the country, and until the army of 100,000 men is in its permanent stations, it will be impossible to arrive at the exact amount of equipment which will have to be handed over, and which is surplus to. the -amount authorized by Tables 2 and 3 of Article 169.
Article 165.-Maximum number of Guns, Machine Guns, Trench Mortars, Rifles and amount of Ammunition allowed during the period of the reduction of the Army to 100,000.Heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns and aviation formations which are forbidden by the Treaty, still exist and have equipment.   See also Articles 167 and 169.Article 166.-Maximum Stocks of Ammunition Authorized.See also Article 164.Article 167.-Limitation of Armament and Munitions in Fortresses which germany is permitted to retain.Major-General Hon. Sir F. R Bingham states This Article, owing to its wording, is, in my opinion, the most serious difficulty we have to face. The Germans claim that, by the word armament of the fortresses and strong places, they are allowed to keep a mobile defence for them. Accordingly they have sent in a list of the guns which they propose to keep for these 14 fortresses, amounting to 4,100 guns field, light, heavy and anti-aircraft. The Commission of Control are reading this clause to mean guns in position in the fortresses for which positions have been genuinely prepared, similarly to the armament of the fortresses and fortifications men-tioned in Article 196, paragraph 2, where the words used are : &quot; . . . those in position at the date of the coming into force of the present Treaty.&quot; The German Government have been informed that their claim cannot be admitted, and that only two of the fortresses  namely Pillau and Swinerounde, meet the above conditions. They have also been informed that as regards the fortresses of Konigsberg, Custrin and Ulm, if they can furnish a statement showing that emplacements have actually been prepared in these fortresses, and what calibre guns they propose to use, we will re-examine the question.The German Government are holding strongly to their interpretation of the clause, and state that there can be no object in allowing these fortresses to be left in existence if they are not permitted to keep guns in them. They also argue that these fortresses, can be their only defence from attacks by Poland or Czecho-Slovakia. Our argument is that the Peace Treaty visualises an army of 100,000 men with 288 guns, and that to leave a mobile armament of 3,800 guns (armament of 34 divisions) is unthinkable. We have also informed the German Government that if these fortresses are to be armed in the manner in which they wish, they would require a personnel for the manning of the guns which could only be drawn from reserve troops, which reserve is unauthorized.I repeat that I look on this clause as the most important of the whole of the armament clauses, and I hope that if the German Government bring up the question at-Spa the demand will be refused.Note. Since the above was written, General Bingham has reported that the German Government have yielded under protest to the Allied contention that guns may only be retained in the fortresses of Konigsberg, Pillau, Swinemunde, Kiistrin and Ulm, and have now put forward a proposal for the retention of 836 guns in these five fortresses, which, although a reduction on their original proposals, is still considered excessive, and it is not intended to agree without further consideration.Decisions and Letters.1. Letter from General Nollet to German Government, dated 13th March, 1920, laying down the armament Germany may retain in fortresses on her southern and eastern frontiers.   (Annexe No. 12.)2. Letter from German Government to General Nollet, dated 16th April, 1920,. regarding armament of fortresses, together with a memorandum on the German., fortresses.   (Annexe No. 13.)
Article 168.-Control and closing down of Factories.The German Government have been informed that they may keep two factories for guns,, two for machine guns and rifles and two for ammunition, and they have also been informed of the capacity for output to which these factories should be restricted,They are arguing this decision and state that the above Article does not restrict the amount which they may be allowed to manufacture. The right of the Allied and Associated Powers to lay down the amount to be manufactured will be insisted upon..The final decision regarding the classification of authorized war-factories has not yet been arrived at.The German proposals which have been received, and&apos; which cover 45 factories, cannot be admitted.As the question interests both the Naval and Aeronautical Commissions as well as the Military Commission it has been decided, on the suggestion of General Bingham, President of the Armaments Sub-Commission, to carry out a joint investigation into this matter. Representatives of the three Inter-Allied Commissions have been deputed to do this.Although in the second part of this Article it states that: &quot; Within three months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, all other establishments for the manufacture, preparation, storage or design of arms, munitions, or any war material whatever shall be closed down,&quot; owing to the enormous quantity of factories - in Germany, the work is only practically in its infancy. There are many thousands of factories in Germany approximately 15,000 in Prussia alone and the question is a matter of time.Detailed inspections are being made, and instructions are being given as to the transformation or disposal of machinery. Up to the present, 1,048 factories have been inspected or are in the course of inspection, while 676 have been given a free certificate.When fuller information has been received it is hoped that many of the smaller factories may be eliminated, and the only possible way we can compete with the work will be to deal only with, the more important ones. The only incident of importance which is raising a certain amount of excitement is that of a preliminary inspection at Krupps at Essen, where it was discovered that they were completing an order for some 77-mm. guns.   Manufacture has been stopped and an explanation has been obtained.Article 169.-Surrender of War Material.Major-General the Hon. Sir F. R. Bingham states : The return given in Annexe No. 16 shows the amount of war material surrendered by Germany, also the amount destroyed by the German Government both before control and since control was instituted.The list of guns is, in my opinion, satisfactory ; the list of rifles and machine guns unsatisfactory. It is stated by the authorities that rifles and machine guns have been sold and stolen, and that owing to the disturbed state of the country it is impossible to discover their whereabouts.By the decision of the Council of Ambassadors, Article 169 of the Peace Treaty has been read that the material after destruction is the property of the Allies and is to be sold by the Reparations Commission, and the amount received credited to the German Reparation Account. This decision is causing much delay in the work of the Commission.The second clause of Article 169 states that the surrender is to be effected at such points in German territory as may be selected by the Allied Powers, and that arms, munitions and war material will be delivered to the said Powers who will decide as to their disposal. Owing to the difficulties of transport this has been waived and material in the various depots, some 160 in number, is being destroyed in situ.Re the 3rd paragraph, with reference to armament, munitions and war material of non-German origin, lists have been furnished by the German Government, and it has been left to each nationality to dispose of its own material as it thinks fit. On behalf of the British Government, I am making arrangements through an officer of the Ministry of Munitions Disposals Board to sell this material in Germany for the credit of the Disposals Board. The quantities surrendered-especially in guns appear very inadequate in view of the losses which we know of. But,, according to the statement of the German Government which there is no opportunity of verifying guns and gun-barrels were immediately broken up and used for raw material.
With reference to the question of the surrender of war material, we find that a considerable amount has already been destroyed by the Germans before the ratification of the Peace Treaty, and destruction continued up to the 10th March, when the lists of material were supplied to us, and on which date we assumed control of the material..., Note. The Foreign Office take the view that the material surrendered under Article 169 becomes the absolute property of the Allies as decided by the Conference of Ambassadors on the 10th February, 1920. The Foreign Office holds, however, that the object of this Article and the accompanying Articles was to ensure the reduction of German armaments to the prescribed quantity and that any material existing in Germany when the Treaty began to operate, i.e., on 10th January, in excess of the quantity allowed, became the property of the Allied Powers in order that it should be destroyed. This, however, does not, in their view, mean that Germany was not at liberty before that date to take steps to reduce her armaments by destroying some of the material herself, and it is, therefore, only the material which remained after such destruction, and after destruction of the quantity allowed, which became the property of the Allies under Article 169.Decisions and Letters.1.

(Appendix IV.)Article 170.-Prohibition of Import and Export of War Material.Major-General the Hon. Sir F. R. Bingham states : The German Government have informed the Control Commission that they have issued orders on the subject of import and export of material, but have not issued. a law on the matter, and they have beeen requested to do so. There is no doubt that a large quantity of material has been stolen and sold to foreign countries.My private information is that the German Government are doing their best to stop this export of war material, and state that Schieber (profiteers) in collusion with manufacturers have exported quantities of material, and the German Government have been unable to prevent it. They are, however, now taking steps to make more stringent regulations at the ports to attempt to stop this illicit export.Decisions and Letters.1. Decision of Marshal Foch.

Article 171.-Prohibition of Gas and Tanks.Major-General the Hon. Sir F. R Bingham states : The manufacture of asphyxiating, poisonous and other gases has stopped, and so far as possible, steps are taken in the chemical factories to prevent further manufacture. As a matter of fact, these steps can only be successful to a very limited extent, as an article such as chlorine is employed in every day use.The German Government have been informed that Flammenwerfer cannot&apos; be allowed in future, but they have written stating that Flammenwerfer do not come under the head of this article, as they are not asphyxiating or poisonous, and they are only for moral effect. This contention cannot be agreed to, and the German Government has been informed that the manufacture of Flammenwerfer cannot be permitted and have been requested to furnish a statement giving the number and location of all Flammenwerfer existing in Germany, whether in the hands of the troops or not, in order that the District Committees may control their destruction.Article 172.-Information required as to Chemical Preparations.The documents asked for in the above Article with reference to the chemical and explosive secrets have been handed over to the Control Commission.The German Committee of Experts have stated that they are prepared to answer any questions which the Commission of Control may wish to ask.This clause has been completely carried out.Article 173.-Abolition of Compulsory Service.-A letter dated 5th May has been received from the German Government in reply to the letter of 8 th March in which General Nollet called for the abolition of the laws relating to compulsory service. This is the first communication which the Commission of Control have received from the German Government on the subject. It embodies a Note from the Reichswekrministerium which is sufficiently important to reproduce in full.   It is as follows : , The old compulsory service army is dissolved. No control will be exercised over the men liberated (reserves). The new army will be constituted by voluntary enlistments, conformably to paragraph 2 of the law on the constitution of a provisional Reichswehr, dated 6th March, 1919.The men belonging to the reserve are, by decree of 21st January, 1920, released from all military obligations and in consequence are subject to no military service.For all practical purposes universal compulsory service is, therefore, in reality suppressed. The formal suppression of the former military laws is projected in the new law constituting the Reichswehr which has been submitted to the Reichb-rat but which the National Assembly has as yet, in consequence of more urgent tasks, been unable to vote.This is the first admission the Commission of Control have had of the truth of their contention that the legal obligation still exists.A letter, dated 6th May, has also been received from General von Cram on enclosing a copy of the law on the formation of a provisional Reichswehr (6th March, 1919), and of a law (dated 31st March, 1920), of one paragraph, prolonging this law &quot; until the expiration of the day on which the law on the Reichsheer (the Peace Army) shall be published.&quot; This law did nothing to abolish compulsory service; it merely empowered the President to demobilize or dissolve (aufzuldsen) the existing army and to form a provisional Reichswehr : General von Cramon also refers the Commission to . the Orders published in the &quot; Army Orders Gazette &quot; for the execution of this law. These decrees have been examined and they leave the question&apos;where it was. One of the most recent relating to the reserve (Beurlaubtenstand) appeared in &apos;&apos; Army Orders &quot; of 24th April (No. 29) and, as before, merely released the reserve from &quot;all military relations &quot; [aus jeglichem Militarverhaltnis).On the 1st June, Wolffs telegraphic Agency communicated to the German Press a statement, said to have been received from a well-informed source, to the effect that
1*2the National Assembly, in ratifying the Treaty of Peace, had legally carried into effect the abolition of universal military service, as laid down by Article 173 of the Treaty, and that thereby any earlier regulations to the contrary had become invalid. As a consequence of this, and the fact that. the former Constitution, by which universal military service was established, had been repealed by the Constitution of the 11th August, 1920., no necessity exists for a special executive law.Decisions and Letters,1. Decisions of the Supreme Council at Boulogne, 22nd June, 1920, regarding compulsory service.   (Appendix IV.)Article 174.-Period of Enlistment for Non-Oommissioned Officers and Men.So far as is known, no steps have been taken by the German authorities to enlist non-commissioned officers and men for the prescribed period of 12 years. Men are enlisted and trained on a short term of 3 to 6 months.In this respect the position is very unsatisfactory, but preliminary administrative measures regarding the 12-year term of enlistment have, however, been taken.Article 175.-Officers retained in the Army must serve up to the age of 45 at least; Officers newly appointed, for 25 years at least.Officers as regards their engagement are in the same position as men in the matter of enlistment.As regards clause 3 of this Article, it is uncertain whether officers who have previously belonged to the old army and are not retained in the new army have been released from all military obligations. Army Orders have been issued which purport to release officers and men from military &quot; relations&quot; ; these Orders are regarded by the Commission as worthless so long as the laws relating to universal compulsory service remain unrepealed.Article 176.-Limitation of Number of Military Schools.Four schools have been authorized on the basis of &quot;one per arm.&quot; A fifth (signalling school) was instituted but its suppression was called for by the Commission, and it was abolished on the 22nd May.The schools for officers and student schools are understood to have been closed.The cadet schools are being all reopened, ostensibly as civilian schools, but they contain a large number of former cadets, and have also retained a considerable portion of the former instructional staffs.The suppression of the cadet schools has, therefore, not yet been thoroughly carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Commission, which ordered the dispersion of pupils and instructional staff.The pupils of the non-commissioned officers&apos; schools which have been closed are received at Annaburg where they constitute a school adjoining the school for soldiers&apos; children.   This is also not in agreement with the decision of the Commission.With these exceptions the Commission of Control considers Article 176 has been completely carried out.Article 177.-Military matters forbidden in Educational establishments and Associations of every Description.According to a reply (dated 11th February) of the German Government there are no associations, societies, &amp;c, occupying themselves with any military matters. The existence of unions of demobilized officers and soldiers is admitted, but it is contended that they concern themselves solely with the interests of their individual members. This is doubtful.. University students, particularly in Berlin, played a prominent part in the recent military revolution, and are believed to have formed a considerable element in the Zeitfreiwilligen.  (See Articles 159, 160, 163.)All educational establishments are now under the Ministry of Education, except the four authorized schools vide Article 176, but in the case of the cadet schools this transfer is believed to be more nominal than real, and the Commandant of the Cadet Corps is still exercising his functions.
ISArticle 178.-All Measures of Mobilization Forbidden.Nothing is known of any &quot; measures of mobilization.&quot; The question of supplementary cadres is dealt with under Article 160. General Nollet reported on the 15th April that according to reports from control -officers, the Versorgungsstellen (Claims Offices) and Abwickelungsstellen (Demobilization Offices) were incapable of undertaking any measures of mobilization.Article 179.-Prohibition of German Military Missions Abroad, and of enrolment of Germans in Foreign Armies.No German Military Missions abroad are known to exist.Numerous reports have been received of Germans serving in the Bolshevik armies in Russia, but it has been found impossible to prove that any German Missions exist or that Germans have been enrolled with the knowledge and sanction of their Government.Article 180.-Dismantling of Fortresses and Field Works.1. The dismantling of all fortified works in &quot; unoccupied &quot; territory west of a line -drawn 50 kilometres east of the Rhine is due for completion by the 10th of July, 1920. As far as can be foreseen the work cannot be completed by this date as the German authorities have not yet established any working organization on the ground which might enable them to complete the task within the period specified, and it is probable that all the work demanded will not be completed before the end of September.In detail, the situation is as follows for each fortified place coming under this -category: Istein. Certain armoured turrets have been removed and concrete works on a minor scale have been demolished. Colonel Klotz of the German Peace Commission reported, on 11th May, that the trenches had been filled in and barbed wire removed for a distance of 20 kilometres along the Rhine. The work of dismantling was commenced before the ratification of the Peace ^Treaty, and the work of dismantling on a larger scale has now been given out to nine contractors, who were to have started actual work on the 1st June.(;ermersheim.-No work has yet been commenced, but preparations are being made.Wesel. The work of dismantling is in hand, a number of breaches are being made in the parapets and masonry work is being blown up. This work is not considered sufficient.The German Project has been returned to General von Cramon with a statement .saying that it only fulfils very imperfectly the instructions contained in a letter of the 17th April and that it ought to be reconsidered in accordance with the principles laid down in that letter.   No detailed reply was made to the Project stating exactly what was required.An application for an extension of one month (viz., to 10th August) has been refused.Rastatt. Nothing has yet been done. The method of dismantlement is still under discussion, and a sub-commission is considering on the spot the amount of demolition work which should be insisted on.Upper Rhine. A number of works near Mulheim.   Nothing has yet been done.Note. General Nollet has reported that Article 180 has been complied with in so far as armaments are concerned. It is generally held that the complete work of dismantlement of fortifications will not be finished before the end of September.2. In occupied territory, where the period for execution of dismantling is to be fixed by the Allied Higher Command, proposals have been submitted recently by the Commission of Control that the period should be fixed as six  months for. the -dismantling of the fortifications in toto, and three months from now for the concrete and masonry portions, as from the date of notification to the Germans. ** The German Government have now been notified that the period allowed for dismantling has been Jixed for 10th September, 1920, for masonry work, and 10th December, 1920, for total dismantling.
The difficulty and delay in obtaining from the German authorities particulars of these fortresses have delayed the proposals as to time limits for the execution of this work.   It is on record that three months after the ratification of the Peace Treaty, the Fortifications Sub-Commission was still without the particulars necessary to begin -dismantling the fortifications on the left-bank of the Rhine.   No work has been done in these works to date.3. As far as is known, no new fortification has been constructed in the1 zone concerned.4. As regards the last paragraph of Article 180, which allows the Germans to maintain in its existing state the system of fortified works on the southern and eastern frontiers ol Germany, a long discussion on principle has taken place, the Commission of Control holding that it was necessary to visit and take records of these works to ensure they were not increased, whereas the German Government declined to share this point of view. Replies have now been received from General von Cramon and from the German Minister of Foreign Affairs with reference to the resolution of the Council of Ambassadors, dated 11th March, that the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control has the right to record, to verify and to visit the said fortified works.The German Government, in their reply, while not admitting that the decision of the Supreme Council is in accord with the text of the Treaty of Peace, agree to the demand regarding the inspection and examination of the fortresses remaining to Germany. General von Cramon has forwarded a list of all forts and fortified works of the coast fortifications and those on the southern and eastern frontiers, together with maps showing the position of all these forts and fortified works.The British section consider that these documents afford all the essential information required to carry out the terms of the Treaty.All available officers were to proceed during the week ending .29th May to inspect the fortifications in question with German liaison officers; the maps will be checked and reports submitted.   No estimate can be given of the time required &quot;for this.Decisions and Letters.1. Letter from General Nollet to Marshal Foch, dated 8th May, suggesting a time limit for the destruction of German fortifications in occupied territory and in the Eael rectangle.   (Annexe No. 23.)2. Decision by the Conference of Ambassadors on the 25th May agreeing to the recommendations put forward by General Nollet regarding the Kiel rectangle.Article 195.-Ordering the Destruction of all German Coast Defences inthe Western Baltic.There is no knowledge of the erection of any fortifications in the Kiel rectangle-flat. 550 27&apos;&quot; N. and 540 00&apos; N. and long. 90 00&apos; E. and 170 00&apos; E.), nor of the existence of any guns commanding the maritime routes between the North Sea and the Baltic.The whole of the guns have been completely dismounted, with the exception of two in turret mountings, and these are being dismounted.All the more recently constructed batteries have been almost completely demolished.All the look-out stations and command posts are either demolished or in a derelict condition. Work of dismantling of some kind has been undertaken in practically all the older type batteries and forts.There are four gangs of workmen employed in blowing up gun platforms and masonry work, and although recently there has not been more than 150 men employed daily, it is anticipated that the work will shortly be pressed more vigorously.A project showing the work at present contemplated by the German Government was received last week, and as it is incomplete it has been proposed to return it to Marshal Baron von Bieberstein without detailed examination and criticism in a similar way to the reply sent as regards demolition work at Wesel.The proposals from the Kiel District Committee have now been received and are under consideration.The British section consider that the work of demolition of the fortifications and. the removal of the guns has already proceeded as far as fulfils the reasons given in the - first paragraph of Article.195, viz.,.&quot;in order to ensure the free passage into the Baltic of all nations, and the prohibition of installing any guns commanding the maritime routes between the North Sea and the Baltic.&quot;
Article 1%.-Coast Defences on the North Sea and Baltic, other than those Fortifications mentioned in Article 195, and in Section XIII. (Heligoland) may be maintained in their existing state. No new Fortifications may be constructed.1. The fortifications concerned, which may remain in their existing condition, come under the same category as those described in 180 (4) above, and the same remarks apply i o them as have been made above. The documents necessary for recording purposes have been received from the German authorities, and the work of inspection is in hand and should be completed by 31st August to the satisfaction of the British section.2. As far as is known no new fortifications have been constructed within the limits mentioned.Articles 203 to 208. Military Commissions of Control.Articles205 and206-Major-General the Hon. Sir F. R Bingham states : Serious differences have arisen with the Germans over the interpretation of these two clauses. By Article 205, the Commission maintain that they are at liberty to go where they like, when they like, and see what they like. The German Government have appointed liaison officers for each District Committee of the Commission of Control. These officers, acting under instructions from Berlin, have undoubtedly in several of the districts constituted an obstacle to the thorough carrying out of the work of control. They have maintained that officers of the Commission may only visit factories whose names have been supplied from German headquarters at Berlin, and insist on notice being given to factories and dep6ts before the arrival of the Mission. The Germans base their arguments on Article 206, which undoubtedly does state that the Allied Commission are to obtain their information through representatives of the German Government.The Sub-Commission is, however, unanimously of the opinion that the ,work of &quot;demolition should be carried further in order to make it apparent to all that theexisting fortifications have been demolished and are useless and that the terms of -General Nolletfs letter No. 1736 of the 11th February to General von Cramon&apos;arecomplied with.This letter laid down the following conditions for carrying out the dismantling, and these conditions had been agreed to unanimously by the Fortifications Sub-Commission ..and by the Council of the Commission :  *&quot; In principle every system of fortifications, including the details mentioned above, and all isolated works occupying positions in themselves of military value will be completely demolished or rendered useless for defence or military occupation of any sort.&quot; As a general guide, it can be admitted that in obsolete (anciennes) fortifications, the demolition need not be complete, bub all modern or recently reconstructed parts, shelters of all kinds,1 gun emplacements and concrete parapets must disappear.&quot;It appears that the French and other sections now desire a more complete demolition, involving extensive levelling of earthwork, which the British regard as of no practical utility and as only causing unnecessary expense, which may diminish the total amount of the indemnity to be paid by Germany.The British project for the completion of the dismantling of Kiel prepared last January anticipated the completion of the work by 31st August. It is now considered that the essential work should be completed by the end of September.Decisions and Letters.1. Letter from General Nollet to Marshal Foch, dated 8th May, suggesting a time limit for the destruction of German fortifications in the Kiel rectangle. (Annexe No. 23.)2. Decision by the Conference of Ambassadors on 25th May agreeing to General Nollet&apos;s recommendations.
They argue that (i.) Owners of private firms are afraid of allowing free entry to their works, as they&quot; are of opinion that the Commission of Control are employing commercial agents to obtain trade secrets, (ii.) In no country can private premises be entered without the permission of the-owner.(iii.) Persons with forged passes have obtained entry in their works under pretence of being members of the Commission of Control. *(iv.) The fact of the liaison officer being present avoids unpleasant incidents which may arise through discontented workmen, &amp;c.The Commission of Control maintain that the German Government must admit the principle that the members of the Commission of Control can go wherever they please 1 and whenever they please, whether they are accompanied by a German liaison officer or not, and that his presence is not indispenable to their visit to a factory or depot.In a commission like the Commission of Control suspicion is aroused when the Germans try to put obstacles in the way of its free working.I am of opinion that we must insist on our free rights, as mentioned above, and that -once the German Government, have agreed to this principle we can then come to arrangements wherever they can&apos; really prove that exceptional arrangements are necessary.Needless to say, the liaison question is a great deal a question of personality, and. in some districts we have had no trouble.   In others trouble is continuous.In the Frankfurt district, when the French entered Frankfurt, the French president -01 my District Committee unwisely ordered the German liaison officer to leave the town within 24 hours. The German officer and the authorities in Berlin maintain that he was insulted by the French Colonel, and they refuse to send back a liaison officer to Frankfurt until he has apologized. As he is an officer of another nationality, I have informed General Nollet that it is purely for him to deal with the French officer. Meanwhile, the whole of the work in that district is held up, and I personally cannot-see when it will be resumed.*Article 208 (last paragraph)-All necessary documents for the dismantling of the Kiel fortifications have been received, and it is understood that sufficient information has been received for the work being carried out in the Rhineland.The documents demanded for making records of fortifications remaining to Germany were very elaborate and they have not been supplied.   It appears to be-a&quot;question of opinion between the Allies and Germany as to how far documents may be demanded and should be supplied under this Article of the Treaty.Articles 211-213.Article 211-None of the legislative measures  demanded by the Effectives&apos;&apos; Sub-Commission for giving effect to the provisions of the Treaty has been taken,, although the prescribed period of 3 months has expired.    (See also note under Article 173.)&apos;Decisions and Letters.1. Decision of the Supreme Council at Boulogne, 22nd June, 1920, regarding German legislation.   (Appendix IV.)Conclusion.The essential points in connection with the disarmament of Germany and those which should be insisted upon at the Conference at Spa are given below in their order of importance.(a.) The destruction of all war material in excess of the quantity allowed to germany by the Peace Treaty.This is a matter of urgency, especially as regards artillery.   The question has been dealt with under Articles 167 and 169, and it has been pointed out that to allow Germany to retain a mobile artillery armament of 3,800 guns-as originally claimed by Lir under Article 167 is impossible to contemplate.
(b.) The abolition of the laws enjowing universal compulsory military service inGermany.Until formal measures have been taken by the German Government under Article 173, there will still remain all the legal machinery necessary to resuscitate at short notice the &quot; nation in arms.&quot;(c.) The period of enlistment of twelve consecutive years for non-commissioned officersand men of the German Army.At present in contradiction to Article 174, trained soldiers are serving on short periods of engagement lasting from four weeks to six months, thus increasing the possibility of an unauthorized reserve.(d.) The reduction of the German Army to 100,000.The demobilization and reduction of the German Army in accordance with Articles 159, 160 and 163, have not been carried out. On the contrary, certain unauthorized formations, e.g., Zeitfreiwilligen and Einwohnerwehren exist, in addition to the army which has not yet been reduced to the limits laid down.ANNEXE No. 1.Inteu-Allied Commission of Control. No. 590.From General Nollet, President of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control to Marshal Foch, President of the Allied Military Committee of Versailles.Berlin, 27th March, 1920.In your letter No. 295/1, dated 25th February, 1920, you instructed me to furnish you as early as possible with a report, asked for by the Army Council, on the total strength of the German Police Forces after 10th April, 1920, showing the proportion allotted to the neutral zone.The Idter-Allied Military Commission of Control is not yet in a position to furnish such a report. It has decided (meeting of the Council, dated 2nd March, 1920) to allow Germany an increased strength of police amounting to 10,000 men for the neutral zone, and for a period of 5 years from 10th April, 1920.The under-mentioned information, however, which the German Government was asked&apos; to furnish in November, 1919, and as to which several reminders have been sent, has not yet been communicated by the German Government: (a.) Strength of the police in 1913 (only the information concerning Prussia has been received).(b.) Increase to be fixed in proportion to that of the population (Article 162 of the Treaty of Peace). gNollet.ANNEXE No. 2.Comite Militaire Allie de Versailles.

19that the German forces should be reduced to 200,000 men by the 10th April, L920, that is to say, three months from the coming into force of the Treaty, as provided for in Article 163, and to 100,000 men by the 10th July, 1920.I have the honour to request that you will communicate this decision to the German Government.I have, &amp;c,D. Lloyd George,President.Herr von Sthamer.ANNEXE No. 4. Translation. -A. No. 441/20.My Lord, 21 st April, 1920.I have the honour to transmit herewith three copies of a memorandum by the Minister of Imperial Defence respecting the continued retention of an army of the strength of 200,000 men.- Annexe I of the memorandum has not reached me up to the present.I have, &amp;c,Sthamer.The Eight Hon. Earl Curzon of Kedleston, &amp;c.Translation.Memorandum of the Minister of Imperial Defence in regard to the Permanent Retention of an Army of the strength of 200,000 men.In accordance with the Peace Treaty and the note of the Allied States, dated 18th February, 1920, Germany is to reduce its army to 100,000 men by 10th July, 1920, and accomplish the arrangement of forces prescribed in the Peace Treaty. No change is to be permitted in this military organization -until Germany is admitted into the League of Nations, which can in that event consent to any modifications appearing desirable. The conditions imposed on Germany are to represent the first stage on the way to the general restriction and limitation of armaments, to bring about which shall be one of the principal duties of the League of Nations.I.The strength of the fighting forces of a State, on the assumption that the League of Nations is able to protect it from unwarranted attacks on the part of its neighbours, must, in the first place, be determined by domestic conditions. In this respect the latest events have shown in a lurid light on what uncertain political ground Germany is still standing. They have shaken and strained afresh to the utmost the internal political and economic situation. The troops now at the disposal of the Imperial Government for the suppression of revolutionary movements from all quarters and for the re-establishment of political and economic order will scarcely suffice to restore the authority of the Government and maintain it permanently, and can only do so if no extension occurs of the riotous masses and the formerly quiet parts of Germany continue to remain quiet.It will also only be possible by a complete control of affairs to deprive the insurgents of the weapons still unlawfully in their possession.The time of the coup d&apos;etat from the Right without doubt came as a surprise to the Radical-Bolshevist elements of the German population. The gathering together of all the revolutionary elements for a united, well-led counter-stroke was thereby wrenched from their hands. In spite of this their counter-movement began in an astonishingly large and strongly organized volume. Should a revolution emanate from these elements, there is a danger that it will flare up in still greater strength and at the same, time over the whole of Germany.
A dangerous delusion would be cherished should the idea gain ground that the risk of revolt is finally eliminated after the restoration of order. In consideration of the Bolshevist infection to be ascertained in many localities and the continued extraordinarily strained economic and political condition of-Germany, a radical improvement of the internal political situation in the near future is not to be thought of. The numerous unruly masses of Germany will again flare up as before. The elements of unrest will again stir up and incite and seek to extend their efforts to the quieter districts and the more sober portions of the population. In the difficult economic situation they will henceforward find the most fruitful soil. Add to this that a durable and reliable grasp of the various political ideas has not yet taken root in the large mass of the people. Trivial incidents and acts of omission and commission may in the future bring about suddenly a complete reaction in the mood of the masses and confront the Imperial Government with fresh situations of difficulty. It must therefore have at its disposal a means of preventing revolutionary occurrences by its existence alone, or, should such incidents occur, of quelling them with certainty in a short time.This means can only be sufficient military strength. It is unthinkable that under the conditions stated the authority of the Government should be maintained over a people of 60 millions with 100,000 men. Without adequate military forces the German Government is also in no wise able, to the prejudice of the Allied Governments, to comply with the obligations of the Peace Treaty, in particular so far as they are of an economic nature.Police forces cannot serve as a substitute for the army. They are tied to one spot, only qualified for purely police duties, and not transferable. They lack the organization for unified direction. They can possibly support the army and remove from its shoulders the burden of the less important work in the large towns, but can never carry out larger operations and warfare.. As the police never acts as a united, unbroken body, its existence will not have the preventive effect which is exercised by an unbroken body of troops.The attached garrison map shows how the various formations of-an army of 100,000 men would be scattered over the whole country. The attempt to occupy the centres of unrest with garrisons proved to be impracticable, as entire stretches of land would otherwise be completely devoid of troop&apos;s. If in consequence of the reduction of the army to 100,000 men the arrangement of troops indicated in the map has to be carried into effect, the result will be a great waste of forces, considerable difficulty in assembling the troops for common action, and the necessity of transferring important territorial authority to subordinate leaders. It clearly follows that such an army can never and nowhere act effectively in the event of sudden widespread agitation, and that the lack of success of its action springs from itself. In accordance with the prescribed arrangement of the army of 100,000 men, territorial authority must in the event of disorders be delegated to the higher leaders over extensive districts, which they cannot possibly supervise from the places where they are stationed. It is frequently difficult to maintain touch with the local authorities and work amicably with them, and often quite impossible.   The nine higher commands prescribed are hence inadequate.On the forces being doubled the objections cited above cease to exist. The country can be more thickly beset with garrisons, and in particular strong forces can be collected in the vicinity of the turbulent masses. The larger number of commands permits of a reduction of the territorial districts of the commanders, and consequently the cultivation of better relations with the civilian authorities. The existence of such a force will repress all revolutionary attempts from the outset, protect froin terror those willing to work, and cause. the economic life to revive and develop unhindered by political strivings. An army of the strength of 200,000 men will comply at least approximately with the demands of the internal situation.A reduction of the army will be attended with serious consequences under present circumstances. The coup d&apos;e&apos;tat on the part of the Right Radicals could only be attempted because there were troops which allowed themselves to be misused for the purposes of that party. The troops which placed themselves at its disposal were to be disbanded by reason of the provisions of the Peace Treaty. Even if their members had been helped over the difficulties arising thereby the way would have been opened to incitement to revolution. The officers and men called up by the Government in the emergency of the spring of 1919 must be turned by it into the street under the pressure of the Peace Treaty. It is easy for the revolutionary instigators to obscure the fact that the Government could not act otherwise.This incident shows what a problem almost incapable of solution will confront the German Government if it must proceed in the circumstances at present prevailing to the disbandment of further corps.
The paid soldier thereupon ceases to be removed for a certain time from the ^economic struggle.   If forced to re-enter civilian life earlier than it affords him unconditional promise of a livelihood, he feels himself imposed upon and falls an easy victim to those who would lead him astray.II.The Pact of the League of Nations provides for a general disarmament of all States. In accordance with the Peace Treaty, a start is to be made with Germany. It has been forced to this step; but no Allied or neutral State has yet emulated it in this respect. No decisions in this direction have been made by the League of Nations and yet these ; should be its first measures.Even assuming that Germany were to possess an army of 200,000 men, it could not be considered as a fighting force either for defence or for aggressive action against a foreign Power. An army thus limited in strength will probably be able to repel armed incursions of smaller forces and bands, and even in a short time to form a certain frontier protection in connection with the existing fortifications, but this force would be completely inadequate as a weapon of defence against a well-equipped hostile invasion. Still less, however, could an army of 200,000 men, behind whom stand no reserves of any land, and which in regard to armament is subject to the limitations provided by the Peace Treaty, be used for any offensive purpose, quite apart altogether from the fact that it is just at the time of foreign complications that it becomes necessary to keep strong forces in the interior of the Empire for the maintenance of order and lawful government.III.    &apos;The postponement of the formation of an army of 100,000 men to a later period, when more stable conditions in Germany can be reckoned on, would render a service to the German and also to the Allied Governments. The unity and solidarity of the army suffers most severely because the soldiers are in uncertainty as to their future. It is not possible at present to select soldiers to form the 100,000 men army, as the others, being certain of early dismissal, would be found completely wanting and would he a danger instead of a support to the Government and the orderly elements. All uncertainty must now be removed as to the future of the soldiers and the organization of the army, and this as soon as possible, otherwise the protection of the army will be lacking.   The consequences might be incalculable for Germany and Europe.IV.If Germany is allowed to continue to keep an army of 200,000 men, the organization of the latter must correspond to the Peace Treaty, i.e., the units must be double those prescribed in the Peace Treaty.   This gives a strength of 4 general commands, 14 infantry divisions, 6 cavalry divisions.Germany is, however, unable in its impoverished and severely injured economic condition to bear the great expense of six cavalry divisions, therefore application is made that instead of the other three cavalry divisions, three infantry corps may be agreed to. If it is arranged that the strength should be 8,000 officers and 192,000 men, the following result is arrived at -4 general commands, 12 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions, 5 infantry brigades.The first three correspond to the dispositions prescribed in the Peace Treaty. The brigades would be arranged like the divisions, but would show no artillery commanders and columns, and only two infantry regiments and two artillery corps. Application is therefore made that in addition the following corps of special weapons be allowed : For each of the 12 infantry divisions one battalion of heavy artillery, with one high angle fire (Steilfeuer) and one flat trajectory fire (Flachfeuer) battery, in addition to a total of eight flying units and four companies of railway troops. For reasons in favour of these formations, which are all comprised in the strength of 200,000 men, see Annexure 2.
For the statement of strengths resulting from this, see Annexure 3.The proposals are due to the effort to secure for Germany the necessary safeguards-, against disturbance from within and without of its development and for the unhindered reconstruction of its economic life.   They represent the utmost required by the German. Government in the effort to do justice to the demands of the Peace Treaty.   Therefore they do not only correspond to Germany&apos;s interests, but also to those of the Allied Governments.Annexure -1. Reasons in favo\ir of permission being granted for the retention of&apos; formations of heavy artillery, railway troops, and temporarily also, aviation.Heavy artillery.Experience has shown especially in the recent combats that heavy artillery cannot be dispensed with even in civil warfare.   The insurgents are considerably superior in number to the government troops; they dispose of ordnance of heavy calibre and direct their combats in accordance with the experience gained in trench warfare by constructing field fortifications.   In view of this superiority, and to fight effectively, the government troops must have at their disposal equivalent or superior weapons of offence.   In this respect, only firing from heavy ordnance, of which a few are sufficient, is effective in breaking resistance.   Much blood has thereby been spared.   The troops must have this means of combat at their disposal to be able to employ it immediately in an emergency.   In most cases time for effective use is lost by getting them out of fortress stores or fetching them from other places.   Even for the protection of the frontiers heavy artillery cannot be dispensed with, as all the eastern neighbours, and. also Russia&apos;s Red armies possess this weapon.Railway troops.The efforts of revolutionary elements are directed in the first place to paralysing railway traffic, partly for political reasons, and partly to prevent movements of troops. If they succeed in this, it is impossible to collect troops quickly and the army is-deprived of the possibility of restoring tranquillity and order in the country. It is therefore absolutely necessary to dispose of companies of railway troops, with which traffic can be maintained for troop movement and which can also repair railways destroyed.Aviation.Small flying formations are asked for only temporarily until internal conditions are more composed.   Their duties are the following : (1.) Maintenance of communication and conveyance of information and individuals in the event of the destruction or lack of the usual means of communication (railways, telephones, telegraphs).(2.) Enlightenment, composing and warning population by scattering bills.(3.) Reconnaissance and control of measures hostile to the State and movements-of the State&apos;s troops.   Intervention in street combats.(1.) In the event of paralysis of public railway traffic and destruction of . telegraphs and telephones, the direction requires a sure means of transmitting orders and information.    Only aviators can be employed for this purpose.   They cannot-consequently be dispensed with even in internal disorders.(2.) The sudden appearance of aircraft over agitated districts and rebellious, cities, the scattering of bills with the announcement of the impending arrival of troops, warning against armed resistance, threats of severe punishment for offence against hostages, &amp;c, has a sobering effect on insurgents and a composing effect on the order-loving population. Tumults have in this manner repeatedly been nipped in the bud and the further extension of disorderly masses prevented. . Untrue rumours, false reports hostile to the Government, whose refutation would be impossible in consequence of the powerful opposition of public placards, could easily be rectified by scattering foreign newspapers and enlightening news from the Government.(3.) In carrying out operations against riotous towns, aviators are indispensable to leaders and troops for locating the insurgents&apos; measures and united direction of their own movements, reconnaissance of street. crowds, discovery of guns, trench-mortars,, dug-outs and machine-gun nests, observation of artillery and trench-mortar operations,, can only be accomplished by aircraft in street combats not easy of survey.

On the Government troops forcing their way into riotous cities, armed mobs could frequently be dispersed without loss of blood simply by the descent of a single airship upon the crowd. The insurgent and little disciplined bands proved unable to cope with the great moral impression produced by such aircraft.Bodies of the Governments troops cut off or hemmed in were able repeatedly to be ; ^supplied by aircraft with information, orders, regulations, food and munitions.Civilian aviators are out of the question for these tasks, because, apart from other reasons, they fail in times of political unrest. Even the Deutsche Luftreederei, the great aerial traffic company, during the general transport strike in March, was obliged to cease its aerial service between Berlin and Weimar in consequence of the strike. In : such times military aviators only are a reliable medium of intelligence and traffic in the hands of the army, because they are politically neutral and independent of any civilian -organization (Transport Workers&apos; Union).The demands made in this respect on military aviacors show the work performed -&quot;by a single such formation, which in 3 months effected approximately 500 communica-tions, &amp;c flights of 80,000 kilometres.The necessity and expediency of using military aircraft during internal unrest has frequently been pointed out by English official departments. It has also been recognized by Lieut.-General Michelet, Commander of the Army of Occupation of the 4th Zone of the Rhineland. In a letter of 8th October, 1919 (No. 314/IV., 1 Buro), he allows the German commander of Section 1 of the neutral zone to use a squadron of six aircraft in the event of serious disorder. In a similar sense representatives of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control at a meeting on 3rd October, 1919, in the Foreign Office at Berlin, expressly reserved to themselves the establishment of a military aerial communication service to Berlin in the event of strikes, &amp;c. Also the urgent journey of Lieut.-Colonel Tidbury from Upper Silesia to Berlin on 20th October, 1919, had to be accomplished in a German military airship, in view of the uncertain and slow traffic conditions. :Each aerodrome shall only have 20 service airships at its disposal. The arming of airships with rigid built-in machine guns is expressly renounced. For,special duties of combat solely, 15 machine guns and a small number of aerial bombs shall be kept in ,stock at each aerodrome.
Reply or the Supreme Council to the German Note, dated20th April, 1920.*The Allied Powers have examined the letter of M. Goeppert of the 20th April,., which presents a request from the German Minister of War to the effect that the German Government desires to maintain a German Army of 200,000 men instead of&quot; 100,000 provided for in the Treaty of &quot;Versailles, and declaring that this is necessary for the maintenance of order.The Allies \\ ish to state at once that a proposal of this nature cannot even be examined so long as Germany fails in the most important obligations of the Treaty of&quot; Peace and does not proceed with a disarmament upon which depends the peace of the world.    Germany is not living up to her engagements either in the destruction of the material of war, or in the reduction of her effectives, or in the provision of coal, or&apos; with regard to reparations, or the cost of the Army of Occupation.She has given neither satisfaction nor apologies for the assaults to which on several occasions the members of the Allied Missions have been subjected.She has taken no steps, as was provided for under the protocol of the Treaty, towards ascertaining her liabilities under the head of reparation, or towards making proposals for fixing the total amount she would thus pay, urgent as is a settlement of nature in the interest of all concerned.    She does not appear even to be considering how she is to meet her obligations as and when they mature.The Allies do not ignore the difficulties with which the German Government is faced, and do not intend to insist upon a too literal interpretation of the Treaty. But they are unanimous in declaring that they cannot permit a continuation of these infractions of the Treaty of Versailles ; that the Treaty must be executed and remain as the basis of relations between Germany and the Allies; and that they are determined,, if necessary, to occupy jointly a further^ portion of German territory or to take any-other measures which will have the effect of assuring the execution of the Treaty. They declare, on the other hand, that it is not their intention to annex any portion of&quot; German territory. . *At the same time the Allies consider that the questions raised by the infractions against the Treaty of Peace and by the measures necessary to ensure its execution will be more easily solved by an exchange of views between the heads of the Governments-than by an exchange of Notes. They, therefore, invite the heads of the German Government to confer directly with the heads of the Allied Governments, and they ask that when they meet, the German Government will present to them precise explanations and proposals on all the matters mentioned above. If a satisfactory settlement is arrived at on these points the Allied Governments will be willing to discuss with the German representatives any question which affects the internal order -and economic well-being of Germany.But Germany must understand that the unity of the Allies for the execution of the Treaty is as solid as it was for the war, and that the only method of taking her place again in the world is loyally to execute the engagements to which she has, subscribed.Hotel Royal,San Remo, 26th April, 1920.

Reply to General Nollet&apos;s Communication of the 12th March, 1920, relative to the Civic Guard (Einwohnerwehren).The German Government, already in the Note addressed by the German Peace Delegation to the then President of the Peace Conference, M. Clemenceau, on the ivtb December last, took the point of view that the establishment of the Civic Guards (Einwohnerivehren) was not in contradiction to the Peace Treaty. The contrary view, which found expression in your Note of the 12th March last, arises from incorrect assumptions as to the nature and aim of the Civic Guards (Einwohnerwehren). Under the pressure of the necessity of effectually protecting the life and property of the peaceful population, in the confusion of the last year the order loving elements in the towns and^ in the country have banded together partly with a view to helping the military forces and professional police organizations where these forces existed in insufficient numbers or were likely to refuse to obey orders, and partly themselves to protect their country from complete chaos, and to reintroduce and to safeguard lawful conditions. In their creation and further developments any idea that they should be used for military aims, more especially in order to prepare for war against a foreign enemy, was excluded, and every safeguard was* given against a misuse of the., organization to such an end. Thus the statement in particular that the Civic Guards (Einwohnerwehren) carry out military exercises does not correspond with the facts. Instruction, in so far as it is correct to call it instruction at all, is confined to preparing for the exercise of purely police functions. The possibility that the Civic Guards (Einivohn&amp;rwehren) could be of any assistance to a mobilization forbidden by the Peace Treaty does not exist already owing to the fact that the different organizations existing in the individual states lacked uniform cohesion and direction from the Empire, and on the contrary, were made entirely independent of one another ; on the part of Empire an influence was exercised only in so far as through the Imperial Central Offices of - the Civic Guards (Einwohnerivehren), a point of contact for the individual Civic Guard organizations between each other was afforded for the carrying out of non-military measures of general necessity (e.g,, life insurance and insurance of members against accidents). A muster according to lists (listenmassvje Kontrolle) in the sense of a preparation for enrollment does not&apos; exist, . Moreover, more than half the Civic Guards (Eimvohnerwehren) were composed of members who were above 40 years of age. It is due to the Civic Guards (Einwohnerwehren) thus organized that the general security has increased since their existence, and that especially since the disturbances of the last week, a great amount of property has been preserved from annihilation, essential means of communication and industries have been maintained, and elements opposed to order have been held in check, especially where the Reichswehr and Sicherheitspolizei could not be on the spot. The Civic Guards&apos; (Einwohnerwehren) have been of quite exceptional assistance with regard to the provisioning of the population, as in the open country every other means of protection for the storing and transport of means of subsistence is wanting.1 The Civic Guards (Eimvohnerwehren) afforded a splendid test of their efficiency in Bavaria; it is largely thanks to their attitude that a year ago the rule of the&apos; Councils did not spread and was finally able to be suppressed, and that, since then further attempts at a repetition of those disastrous conditions have not occurred or have been nipped in the bud. The use of the Civic Guards (Einwohnerwehren), which was hereby proved, has been fully recognized abroad, and on many sides people have seen in the German Civic Guards (Eimvohnerwehren) a &apos; good example of self-defence on the part of the population where the latter could not rely on forces of the State as a means for the maintenance of public security and order.In these circumstances the German Government permitted the formation of the Civic Guards (Einwohnerwehren) in full publicity, and had no reason to conceal in any way their character from the Inter-A Hied Commissions. It is only as yielding to the pressure of the Allied Governments, exercised owing to a want of appreciation of the actual circumstances, that the German Government has now decided to order the disbanding of the Guards in their present form. I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the circular sent to the Governments of the various States oh the 8th instant with regard to this question. The German Government cannot, however, admit that the regulations of the Peace Treaty oblige them to refuse to the population every possibility of such self-defence as will be absolutely necessary until further notice in the present extraordinary circumstances; on the contrary, the Government considers that it is their imperative duty in the interests of the maintenance of the common weal to take all measures compatible with the Peace Treaty which may afford such a means of self-defence. The German Government must, therefore, continue to point out to the-Allied
Governments the extraordinary dangers attending a forcible one-sided disarmament of the most orderly portion of the population, obstructing it in its endeavour itself to protect its peaceful work in town or country. The echo which the publication of the above-mentioned circular has had in all parts of Germany leaves no doubt, whatsoever, that the Imperial Government would be placed in a most serious position if they were not prepared. to attempt the utmost in this connection, with a view to affording the necessary support to the population in its defence of property, order and the threatened economic life of the people (Volkswirtschafi). The Government is also fully conscious of the fact that the maintenance of security within the German Empire constitutes the chief sine qua non of its being able to comply with the conditions of the Peace Treaty, and that it cannot be held responsible if it is gradually deprived of all the means whereby it can counteract the forces, of dissolution of the economic life of the country, and thereby of the very existence of the States.The German Government has put itself into communication without delay with the interested departments in order to attempt to establish permissible organizations which will serve the purpose afore-mentioned. The Government will direct its chief attention to ensuring the maintenance of the local defensive character (of the forces in question) and to the avoidance likewise in the future of all centralization, military organizations and instructions. The German Government reserves to itself the right to issue a further statement as to the results of the measures taken.;   ANNEXE No. 8.(Translation.)Allied Military Committee of Versailles. The Marshal-President.Note, Paris, 19th May, 1920.&apos;I.By his letter of 20th April, the Chief of the German Peace Delegation presented to the Peace Conference a request by the German Government to authorize Germany to keep an army of 200,000 men in place of the 100,000 allowed by the Treaty of Versailles.This army would be constituted as follows  12 divisions of infantry.5 infantry brigades organized as divisions but only having two regiments of infantry and two groups of artillery, instead of 3. -3 divisions of cavalry.Moreover, these units will be provided with heavy artillery and aviation material not authorized by the Treaty.The reasons invoked to justify this request are based on the necessity of maintaining internal order and the guarding of the frontiers.This demand cannot be entertained.At the time of the elaboration of the Treaty it was admitted that the German Army could only be recruited by voluntary engagements of long duration, obligatory service being abolished. But the danger that an army of professional soldiers presents by its ability to form cadres^ for general mobilization has caused the figure of the German Army to be limited to 100,000 men. -The proof of this danger has been signally given since the signature of the Treaty of Germany.. Germany has not yet legally abolished compulsory service; besides under the names of Zeitfreiwilligen and Einwohnerwehren, she has organized reserves of several millions of men, has armed them, has prepared them for eventual employment, and has effectively used them with the Reichswehr at the time of the troubles in Berlin and in the Ruhr Valley.It must be remarked besides that the organization proposed by the German Government foreshadows in fact the formation of 17 divisions of infantry, that is to say, the number of divisions exactly equal to that of the former army corps regionsf       (8326) -      - , -     d 2
remaining within the new German frontiers. There would, therefore, be maintained a German military organization of 1914, each army corps region being occupied by a division, which by virtue of this constitution will be comparatively easy to double.One will be, therefore, liable to see the reforming in a very short time of the equivalent of 17 mobilized army corps.There is no more question to-day than there was in 1919 of authorizing Germany to keep an army, of more than 100,000 men, recruited by means of long, service engagements, nor is there any more reason to modify the organization of this army as fixed by the Treaty.Nor can the modifications demanded on the subject of the armament of the German Army be admitted either The arguments put forward by the German Government are worthless if the German population is deprived of the arms which have been imprudently delivered to it.Finally, the argument of the German Government, based on the necessary dispersal of an army of 100,000 men, cannot be held to be valid if the stations of the military force are determined not in view of serving as cadres for general mobilization, but solely for the purpose of serving as reserves for the police forces.These military forces would be very much more easy to group together than -police forces increased as it is proposed further on, and would allow the suppression of a large number of small garrisons.It, therefore, appears that the clauses of the Treaty concerning the military forces which Germany is authorized to maintain should be maintained in their integrity.II. .    .But, on the other hand, Germany should be authorized to have the necessary police forces. . IIt should be remembered that at the time of the elaboration of the Treaty it appeared necessary, for the reasons indicated above, to limit to 100,000 men the effectives of the German Army. On the other hand, this figure has not been justified by the proof that it is sufficient to guarantee the maintenance of order.To-day it has not yet been proved that an army of 100,000 men, and the police forces maintained at their 1913 effectives, would suffice to maintain order, since up to now the German Government has had at its disposal to-suppress internal troubles forces very much superior.*To place Germany in a position which would not leave any doubt as to the main-tenance of order without increasing the strength of her permanent army, she should be allowed an increase of her police forces.III.What are the necessary police forces ?In 1913 the German police counted for the whole of the territories of Germany -(after reduction has been made for the effectives of the territory definitely lost to her) .a total number of 80,000 men.It was organized by etat particulier: a number of the functionaries were under the administrative authority of their particular State, the others under that of the commune which employed them.After * the war this effective passed 92,000 men as a total for the territories of Germany (after reduction is made for the numbers in the territories definitely lost to her). Moreover, since the war Germany has organized, outside the former police belonging to States, known as Ordnungspolizei, other police known as Sicherheitspolizei. This last is an Imperial police centralized, recruited, armed, organized and instructed almost like the Reichswehr, with which it has a clear, affiliation, although it is under the Ministry of the Interior.The numbers of this Sicherheitspolizei are at present 00,000 men. It is important to note that it is only recruited by short term engagements, and that its cadres &quot;are very carefully picked, which permits it to pass through its ranks and to rapidly instruct a large number of young recruits.* The doubt that exists on this point has, moreover, been emphasized when one compares the military-conditions made -with the different ex-enemy countries by the Treaties which concern thein, this comparison forcing it to be recognized that Germany finds herself from the point of view.of effectives very much less favourably placed than other ex-enemy countries.
Or in round figures     ...      ...      ...      ...   152,000According to what is said above, the maintenance of the Sicherheitspolizei will be equal to an augmentation of the Reichswehr, with this further advantage, that its mode of recruiting by short term engagements will allow the Sicherheitspolizei to become a veritable military school for the youth of Germany.The Sicherheitspolizei should then be suppressed.On the other hand, it is not in the least inconvenient from a military point of view to allow an increase of the effectives of the Ordnungspolizei, on the condition that this police force keeps in its entirety its old character of police d&apos;J$tat, that is to say, administered by a regional administration, with an armament corresponding to its roie.^If the character of this local police is rigorously kept, the importance of the increase of the effectives to be accorded can be calculated on such a scale that the German Government will no longer have reason to make their case based on the maintenance of internal order.This object would be attained if they are accorded as a total for Ordnungspolizei 150,000 men, equal to the total of the actual effectives of the Ordnungspolizei and the Sicherheitspolizei.Moreover, it appears convenient to allow the German Government the increase demanded in the strength of its gendarmerie (17,000 men in place of 12,000 in 1913;, the organization of this corps rendering its military utilization impossible.It is consequently proposed that the Allied Powers should, as soon as possible, make known to the German Government :-(1.) That the military forces of Germany will be maintained at 100,000 men as fixed by the Treaty of Peace, with the organization as laid down in that Treaty.(2.) That the Sicherheitspolizei will be dissolved within a short delay, the time to he fixed.(3.)

T am commanded by the Army Council to reply as follows to &quot;Foreign Office letter No. 201694/39 of 9th June, 1920.2. On 2nd June a letter was received by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff from the British representative on the Allied Military Committee of Versailles, forwarding six copies of a report by the Allied Military Committee, suggesting an answer to the German demand of 20th April, 1920, to be allowed to retain an army of 200,000 instead of 100,000 men.A copy of this report was sent to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on 4th June.3. On 5th June a letter was despatched by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Major-General SackviHe-West, informing him that he was in general agreement with the proposals contained in the report, and on 8th June a copy of this letter was forwarded to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.4. With reference to the proposals contained on the last page of the report of the Allied Military Committee, the Army Council suggest that the disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei should not take place until the German Government has had time to organize an increased force of Ordnungspolizei, amounting to a total of at least 150..000, as recommended in the report. A period of 3 months should be sufficient for this purpose, and it should be made clear to the German Government that the complete disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei must take place by the end of this period.In order to avoid drafting of discharged Reichswehr soldiers, from the Ueber-gangsheer of 200,000 men, which is to be reduced to 100,000 men by 10th July, into the Sicherheitspolizei, during the period of disbandment, instructions should be given to the German Government to this effect, and it should be expressly laid down that the present strength of the Sicherheitpolizei is at no time to be exceeded.5. The Army Council are in agreement with Lord Curzon&apos;s view that it will be sufficient to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris to act upon the recommenda-tions of his military advisers, but would be glad if the observations contained in paragraph 4 above could be conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.6. The Army Council are of opinion that a reply in the above sense should be sent to Monsieur de Fleuriau. They would further emphasize the urgent importance of forwarding a reply to the German Governments demand of 20th April, 1920, with the least possible delay. -I am, &amp;c.jThe Under Secretary of State, B.

Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control.General Nollet to Lieut.-General von Cramon, qualified representative of the German Government with the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control.Berlin, 13th March, 4920.In its letters, &quot; Military Peace Conference, No. 201/20/VI&quot; of 28th January, 1920,. and &quot;Naval Peace Commission, No. B. 6610/F.R. 11,&quot; of 4th February, 1920, the German Government transmitted to the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control complete tables of the armament in guns which it proposed for the fortifications, forts and fortified works which Germany is authorized to maintain.A ccording to the terms of the Treaty of Peace, these works are to be maintained in their existing condition (Article 180), and the guns forming their armament at the date of the coming into Jorce of the Treaty are the maximum authorized. There can, therefore, be no question of assembling in these existing fortresses, or in towns assimilated to fortresses, any stocks of material which would form reserve depots or even mobile stores for heavy artillery, beyond the armament of these fortresses.There can equally be no question of leaving to the German Government a strong heavy artillery dep6t of 3,000 of the most powerful and most modern models, since Article 164 has reduced the number of field guns to 288, also the strength of the German Army, for which mobilization is forbidden, is to be reduced to 100,000 men intended exclusively for the maintenance of order in the interior and the policing of the frontiers, and it is difficult therefore, to understand how personnel for such a large number of guns can be found.The -only guns that shall be retained are those required for the existing gun emplacements at the date of the coming into force of the Treaty in the permanent fortified works.Henceforward among the localities mentioned in the table attached to letter No. 201/20/VI. of 28th January, 1920, those mentioned below, which possess no real fortifications or which have no guns at the present moment, namely : &apos; Breslau,Neisse, Glatz, Gloyau, Spandau, Boy en, Marienburg, Ingolstadt,will no longer have any fixed artillery.At Pillau and Swinemiinde the heavy guns that are at present in the coastal batteries shall be maintained, namely Pillau, 5 batteries; Swinemtinde, 28 guns.In the fortresses of Konigsberg, Ulm and Giistrow the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control will authorize the maintenance of an amount of armament corresponding to the emplacements existing on the 10th January, 1920, in the fortified works where this armament was at that date in position or ready to be put into position. In the same way at Pillau the maintenance can be authorized of an amount of armament corresponding to the amount of armament at Fort Stiehle and in the coastal batteries existing on the south of the passage.The number and nature of these guns shall be determined after new proposals have been received from the German Government and after fresh examination by the Commission, which will make a decision after an examination on the spot.Lastly, the Commission accords to Pillau 10 anti-aircraft guns, and to Swinemiinde 4 anti-aircraft guns. A further communication will deal with Koenigstein and with the fortresses of the North Sea.No reserve of spare tubes will, be provided for. Such a reserve cannot indeed, according to the terms of Article 164 of the Treaty of Peace, exceed one-fiftieth of the total authorized, and it would be practically negligible.All the heavy artillery material, as well as that of the light artillery and anti-aircraft guns in excess of the figures fixed on the basis explained above, will, according
ANNEXE No. 13.Translation.Military Peace Commission, Main Liaison Department.M. 98214/20.To the President of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control, General Nollet.Berlin, 16th April, 1920. In reply to your letter  tat-Major No. 2261/A of the 20th March, 1920 :-1. The calculation of the M.I.A.C.C. as to the equipment allowed for fortresses are based on the supposition that the mounting of guns is only permissible within the fortress according to the pre-war principles of other States.For decades Germany has proposed to use her fortress artillery, apart from armoured and flanking guns, outside the works so as to avoid the fire directed against these distinctly visible targets. Battery protection in the fort intervals had not been constructed in times of peace, partly to avoid expenditure and partly to hamper espionage. Quarters and ammunition recesses had only been constructed in concrete in the neighbourhood of the proposed positions on the more important fronts. The M.I.A.C.C. can convince itself as to the execution of these principles by inspection of the relative German instruction so far as they are in existence. Therefore it would be wrong to take only the number of actually constructed gun positions as a new basis when forming an opinion on the number and calibre of the guns which formed the equipment of the fortresses on the day of the coming into power of the Peace Treaty. Article 167 of the Treaty of Peace expresses clearly that on the coming into force of this treaty Germany is allowed to retain the guns not only in the fortified works [ouvrages fortifies), but also in the fortresses and land and coast forts (see Treaty of Peace, Article 167, translation).The opinion of the M.I.A.C.C. that the fortresses of Breslau, Glogau, Glatz, Neisse, Spandau, Boyen, Marienburg, Ingolstadt and Konigstein, are to- receive no artillery equipment cannot be shared under any circumstances. Without a correspondingly strong equipment with artillery a fortress is useless. The places named were already fortified before the war. Their importance has grown considerably because of the alteration of the frontiers and the change of neighbouring Powers. They have no aggressive value.The matters touched on are more in detail by the attached short memorandum on German fortresses which was originally intended for the higher commands.Based on these documents the German conception should be sufficiently justified.2. The M.I.A.C.C. is of the opinion that Germany with the small size of her army is not in a position to man the guns of all fortresses simultaneously. , This case has not been considered by the German side. It. is only calculated that for all the efforts of the League of Nations a defence would be necessary against some enemy outside the borders. In this case, just because of the small size of the army and its being distributed over the whole country, the fortresses would have to bear the brunt of theto the terms of Article 169, be immediately surrendered to the Commission, for destruction.The German Government, moreover, has communicated to the Commission proposals with regard to the armament of land and sea fortresses in trench mortars, swords and lances, small arms, machine guns, and the corresponding amount of munitions, pioneer material, &amp;c.No individual armament will be provided, for the garrison of fortresses. The defence of these fortresses can only devolve on very small bodies of the authorized troops and these would bring their own arms with them.The only armament that can be considered as that necessary for the oganization of the existing works, such as moyens de flanquement, machine guns, anti-tank rifles. Their nature and quantity cannot be decided until new proposals have been received from the German Government and examined on the spot by the Commission.Nollet.
first attack. As it will mostly be the case of sudden events the equipment necessary for an effective defence must be in the fortress itself A concentration of artillery, &amp;c, from other fortresses, if the situation is threatening, is out of the question. The defending troops must also find sufficiently large stocks of arms and ammunition in the fortresses, which are intended to be used for re-equipment, and above all for replacement in the case of hostilities being prolonged.The temporary occupation would have to be carried out by Reichswehr troops concentrated at the threatened points.The previously mentioned points explain the apparently high total of guns which, however, amounts to only 1,400 guns above a 10 cm. calibre. In fact, this is far too small for every fortress and does not amount to the figures which have been proved to be necessary in position warfare on quiet fronts. This can be proved to the M.I.A.C.C. separately for each fortress.What has been previously said of fortress artillery refers to trench mortars and especially to anti-aircraft artillery. As the development of aeronautics is constantly advancing and Germany is not allowed to have an air force under the Treaty of Peace, it would be especially necessary to protect the most important - points against aerial attacks. That the 500 anti-aircraft guns, which have been given as the total for the fortresses, are by no means sufficient is clear at a glance. They will just suffice to give a certain amount of protection to the most important points of the 14 fortresses. With 10 anti-aircraft guns for Pillau and 4 for Swinetniinde nothing can be done, of course.Armes blanches, small arms and machine guns with the necessary ammunition, close quarter fighting material, pioneer and signal stores previously also belonged to the equipment of every fortress and formed an integral part of it. Firstly, the arms, &amp;c, are necessary for an improvised defence in the case of a surprise attack, and secondly, it will be impossible for the Reichswehr troops concentrated for the manning of the fortress to carry a sufficient quantity of stores and ammunition that would be necessary for a prolonged fight without having a possibility of further supply.It might be supposed that also on- this point the argument given will suffice to show the urgent necessity of the requested equipment of the German fortresses solely for the purpose of land defence.Yon Cramon, Lieut.-General.Short Memorandum regarding the German Fortresses.A. Strategic Importance in General and Objects of the various Fortresses.The new German frontiers are far less advantageous than the old for the purpose of national defence. In the west, the frontier of the Rhine constitutes now a very much weaker protection for Southern Germany than the Vosges, in which there are few roads, while the remaining German territory on the left side of the Rhine has lost its defence, being flanked by and lying open to hostile invasions from west and south.Moreover, in the south and east our neighbours will be unsettled, and we shall be separated from these new and little consolidated States in the south only by a historical and natural frontier (i.e., Bohemian Border Ranges).It would be desirable if the disadvantages of weak frontiers could be made up for by powerful fortifications. A glance at a map shows that for the present this is nowhere the case.Already before the war Germany had exceedingly few and weak frontier fortifications, considering the natural weakness of our frontiers. In consequence of the Peace Treaty the most valuable parts of what she formerly possessed must he ceded or destroyed. The new frontier will therefore be, for the most part, deprived of a protection by fortresses.The German fortifications fall into the following groups : (1.) The East and West Prussian fortresses (Konigsberg, Pillau, Fort Boyen, with costal defences, Marienburg, the latter two of which lie within the plebiscite district).(2.) The fortifications on the Czecho-Slovak frontier (Konigstein, Glatz, Neisse,Breslau, Ciistrin, Swinemunde). (3.) The western and inner German fortresses (Ulm, Ingoldstadt, Spandau). (4.) The coast and island fortifications (apart from Pillau, see (1), and Swinemiinde,seei2)).
Kpnigsberg and Pillau together form the chief fortifications for the defence of the province of East Prussia. To the south-east, Fort Boyon, with extensive Masurian Lakes fortifications, forms an outwork. Marienburg is an important barrier fortress for the lines of communication to the right flank.As regards the East and West Prussian fortresses in particular, the following is to be said : 1. Konigsberg is the centre of the administrative and the economic and intellectual life of those parts of East and West Prussia which remains with Germany. The most important railway lines of East Prussia concentrate in the town, which is at the same time a Baltic port lying at the mouth of the navigable Pregel, and is connected with many waterwa) s.   The possession of Konigsberg is vital for East Prussia.Hence the importance of the fortress, Konigsberg.   Its task is therefore (a.) To form a line of defence for the Samland on the land side, in combination of the Haff line of fortifications. (East Prussia Konigsberg Kurisches Haff and the Pregel Deime line (Konigsberg Tapiau Labiau)).(b.) If the means for the bigger task under (a) are not sufficient to secure the possession of the town of Konigsberg as an independent girdle fortress and to block the lines of communication.2. Pillau protects the port and the approach from the sea to the Frische Haff and to Konigsberg. The fortress forms the rear protection for Konigsberg. The main front is, therefore, that towards the sea. On the land front the fortress is only protected against a coup de main.Together with Konigsberg the fortress of Pillau has the task of securing as great a part as possible of the coast of Samland.3. Fort Boyen is an independent and complete little fortress securing the most important passage in the East Prussian chain of lakes near Lotzen and the lines of communication in that district. It is, moreover, the chief stronghold among the Masurian Lake fortifications, a line of simple fortifications extending from the neighbourhood of Ortelsburg to about Anger burg, and it is intended to prevent a frontal invasion.Fort Boyen and the greater part of the Lake fortifications are situated in the . plebiscite area.4. Marienburg was originally the most easterly bridgehead of the most important crossings of the Vistula and Nogat near Dirschau and Marienburg. Under the new conditions this fortress with its main front to the south serves as a protection for the lines of railways and waterways which join near Marienburg. It bars some important approaches in the direction of Elbing Konigsberg as also towards Danzig. The possibility of attack on the fortress is limited as long as Danzig remains neutral, and the fortress thereby gains in value.   Marienburg, too, is situated in the plebiscite area.To II The frontier against Czecho-Slovakia*is covered by three comparatively small and obsolete fortresses of Konigstein, Glatz and Neisse. Their importance, in the first place, is local, as they form barriers for the lines of communication passing through them and in their neighbourhood. &quot; Although they are not very easy to turn, they are sufficiently well equipped to resist for some time independently, or possibly as a ring fortress, an attack not equipped with the most powerful siege material and to prevent the attacker from utilizing at least a part of very valuable lines of communication.2. Also, the frontier against Poland is practically bare of all fortifications for its defence. We only possess three fortresses on the Oder far distant from each other, representing, in the first instance, bridge-heads, but which must be ready in case of need to offer independently as long a resistance as possible.(a.) The most important of these fortresses is Breslau, since in this provincial capital the administration, and the economic and intellectual life, are concentrated, and because there are here a number of bridges over the Oder. The fortress of Breslau has to safeguard the possession of this important town and to secure the Oder with its rayon bridges.(I).) About 100 km. lower down the Oder is the fortress of Glogau, which is of great use to Germany as a bridge-head over the Oder, and as a harrier to important good crossings over the river.
, (c.) Again, 150 km. lower down, there is the ancient fortress of Ciistrin, which, owing to the detached forts, is of larger size. It is important because it covers several direct roads leading from the east to Berlin, and because several bridges over the Oder lie within its radius.3. Finally, Swinemlinde also belongs to the group of the Oder fortresses, since that fortress covers the mouth of the Oder and Stettin against attacks from the sea. The main front of Swinemunde is directed towards the sea. The land front is only intended to serve as a protection against a coup de main. This is enough, as a siege from the land side is not probable.To III. The entire length of the western frontier of Germany is deprived of the protection of fortifications, as the fortresses of Alsace-Lorraine have been ceded and those on the Rhine have to be razed.Perhaps Ulm might be called a western fortress, but it. is more than 150 km. distant from the Rhine frontier, and is therefore more properly called an inner German fortress. Its task is, besides barring the lines of communication lying within its radius, to secure and keep open the passages over the Danube in both directions, as far as that is possible considering the means at its disposal.The system of forts at Ingolstadt, which is also on the Danube and some 100 km. below Ulm, and likewise 100 klm. distant from the nearest frontiers, has the same task.Finally, there is the old fortress of Spandau to be mentioned, of which the chief purpose at present is to serve as a safe support for the Government in case of internal disturbances.   In addition, it bars the important passages over the Havel at Spandau.To IV. Fortifications, and equipment The permanent works of most of the fortresses enumerated in Section A are few and obsolete. Moreover, in many cases they do not lie in the prospective lines of defence. Nevertheless, these permanent works are of no inconsiderable value as local support and reserve positions. They offer, above all things, good quarters for the troops, safe against attack, at least against any light bombardment, and shelter against the weather, and they would require a strong artillery action to destroy them. Thus they are serving the most important object of all fortifications, viz., gain of time.But the main value of fortresses does not lie in the first place in their permanent and semi-permanent works, but in the theoretical preparations and in their equipment. By their means defence is to be rendered possible over a broad zone, according to modern principles and lessons learnt from war. This zone cannot be chosen so far away from the centre of the fortress as military considerations would require, owing to the limited supply of war material and the small strength of the German Army.Accordingly the equipment is not as complete as might be desired from a purely military point of view. The tasks of the fortresses have, therefore, in many cases to be reduced accordingly, contrary to military exigencies.The number of fortresses remaining to Germany is extremely small considering the extent of German territory, but in proportion to the number of troops it is too large. This might appear illogical, but it is not so, as there is no likelihood that all the fortresses will have to be defended at the same time. The garrisons, on the contrary, can in case of need be transferred.On the other hand, the equipment must be sufficiently complete in order that a garrison thrown into a fortress will find it ready, and that the fortress need not first be equipped afresh.

The Commission was of opinion that the words &quot; livrer &quot; in the French and &quot; surrender &quot; in the English text must be taken in the absolute sense, and that the product of the process of destruction . should remain in the hands of the Allies, who would be free to dispose of it as they consider desirable.

For fortifications situated in occupied territory by the Allied High Command. (2.) For those in the rectangle of Kiel by the Allied Powers.As the Inter-Allied Commission of Control is now in possession of information with regard to the nature and importance of the destructions to be carried out both in occupied territory and the Kiel rectangle, it would now appear possible to fix these periods.After a consideration of the technical conditions and of the possibilities of the execution of this work, the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control is of opinion that the periods for this work could be fixed as follows, as from the date of notification to the Germans : (1.) Three months for destruction of masons&apos; work of all kinds. (2.) Six months for the completion of dismantling.I have the honour to inform you of this opinion of the Commission for the approval, if you consider it necessary, of the Council of Ambassadors.Nollet.(8326) .

APPENDIX I.MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION IN TtlE NEUTRAL ZONE. .The. Neutkal Zonk. 1. German Forces in the Neutral Zone.tOn the 10th June it was semi-officially stated in the Berlin Fress that the German forces in.the Neutral Zone had been reduced to the following total:--10 battalions. 5 squadrons. 1 battery.If this is true, the German forces have been reduced to the strength authorized by Marshal Foch in his letter No. 790/1, addressed to General Nollet, of the 29th April, 1920.This is being investigated by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control.All formations of Zeitfreiwilligen appear to^ have been withdrawn from the Neutral Zone, and the South German Reichswehr troops have returned to their garrisons.By the above decision of 29th April, 1920, this force must be progressively reduced and replaced by a supplementary police force of 10,000 by the 10th July, 1920.r2. Possibility of a fresh Outbreak.It has been very difficult to gauge the situation in the Ruhr correctly owing to the mass of conflicting reports and statements circulated for propaganda purposes.The fear of a Red Terror, which was said to be brewing in the Ruhr, has been exploited by the Reactionary Press with an eye to the recent elections; the Press of the Left, on the other hand, has quoted numerous examples of alleged brutality of the Reichswehr in suppressing the Red rising.The situation apparently became serious towards the end of April, and Severing, the Prussian Minister of the Interior, stated on the 29th April that it would be necessary, he feared, to move troops into the southern part of the Ruhr district; the Bui-germeister of Hagen was then stated to be quite unable to maintain order in his district. This decision was subsequently rescinded, and the Prussian Government decided to employ the Sicherheitsvolizei to restore normal conditions in the south of the Ruhr.All the Red refugees have returned from the occupied territory to the Ruhr, and the German Government has granted an amnesty to the rebels.Towards the end of April there were signs of robber bands having been formed in the southern part of the Ruhr; the resignation of Lieut.-General v. Watter, commanding Wehrkreis VI. at Milnster, is stated to have been due to his opposition to the feeble measures of the Government&apos; in dealing with this situation.lien&apos; Severing has decided that it is not advisable to form Ortswehren (local guards) in the Ruhr to replace the Einwohverwehren, who are in process of disbandment. He considers order can best be maintained by increasing the Sicfwheitspolizei and by dissolving all workmen&apos;s formations which were temporarily formed to maintain order. - These workmens formations apparently proved very expensive to the municipalities. His suggestion as regards Sicherheitspolizei is, of course, contrary to the decision of the Allies.The total of arms surrendered by the workmen in the Ruhr district is quite inadequate. Only about 43,000 rifles out of an estimated total of 90,000 had been handed in by the middle of May. Pear and distrust of the troops make the extremists averse from handing in their arms, and the material for a new outbreak is thus still at hand.The food situation, especially in the Essen district, is reported by the press to be very serious.The French occupation of Frankfurt has inclined the Extremist leaders to think that the German Government in the future probably will not risk increasing its forces in the neutral zone. The Extremists have also seeu that in face of a rising on a large scale as in March, the existing Government forces are quite inadequate to maintain order.Although the situation is dangerous, no outbreak appears likely in the immediate future, unless disorders occur in other parts of Germany. The lesson received by the Reds in the recent fighting has been too severe, and the Independent Socialist leaders will probably be able to restrain members of their party until the political results of the elections are more definitely seen, while the Spartacist leaders will probably await the replacement of Reichswehr troops in the neutral zone by police, and the general reduction of the German Army to 100,000, before attempting a further Communist rising.According to the German press, President Ebert has recently cancelled the Ausuahmezustancl in the Ruhr district; the surrender of arms is to continue.APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION IN THE PLEBISCITE AREAS. Table showing Plebiscite conditions and Allied Garrisons attached as an Appendix.Upper Silesia.There have been frequent disturbances and rioting on a small scale between Polish and German elements recently in Upper Silesia; the Germans have passively resisted the administration of the Commission. The Germans are much dissatisfied with two decisions of the Plebiscite Commission, viz. :-(a.) German Reichstag members for Upper Silesia are no longer to attend the Reichstag on pain of banishment from Upper Silesia. (The Supreme Council has refused to allow elections for the Reichstag to take place in Upper Silesia.)      .........._____(b.) Alterations have been made in the German judicial system.
Dissatisfaction hue also been caused by a misunderstanding regarding the application of the Workmen&apos;s Economic Councils Act (Betriebsr&amp;tegesetz) to Upper Silesia; the Commission have now withdrawn their opposition to this measure being enforced in the plebiscite area.The German Press has recently been publishing copies of documents relating to an alleged Polish conspiracy in Upper Silesia; the German Government has sent a note to General La Rond protesting against the existence of this conspiracy.&apos;Polish propaganda is also rife at the present time; the Poles have demanded the disbandment of the German Sicherheitspolizei, which have already been partially disarmed by the Commission.At present there are no real indications of how the plebiscite will result, but recent Polish demonstrations seem to show that the Poles&apos; chances are improving.Allenstein. &quot;&apos;The Polish authorities are strongly opposed to the plebiscite being held within the next three months.The Poles have demanded the disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei, the replacement of all German officials by neutrals, and the indefinite postponement of the plebiscite.The Polish local committees, in order to mark their disapproval of the policy of the Commission, are at present abstaining from taking any part in the plebiscite control committees.Polish propaganda, carried out by Poles not domiciled in the plebiscite area, is causing considerable irritation to the German population, without advancing the Polish cause.The President of the Commission considers the Polish consul-General is causing trouble and encouraging the more violent Polish elements.There have not been any really serious disturbances in the Allenstein district, but excitement is on the increase.The President of the Commission considers that the forces at the disposal of the Commission are insufficient, and has asked for reinforcements of Allied troops; he also wishes to disband the German Sicherheitspolizei. &apos;The Council of Ambassadors have been notified by the Foreign Office that no, further British troops can be made available for service at Allenstein.According to information from British sources, the Allenstein plebiscite will probably be overwhelmingly in favour of Germany.The plebiscite will be held on the 11th July.Marienwerder.The situation at Marienwerder is generally quiet; the Polish objections to an early plebiscite in Allenstein apply equally to the Marienwerder district.The British representative reported on the 23rd April that he considered the available Allied troops at Marienwerder were adequate for all purposes for which they could properly be used.Men of the Sicherheitspolizei, not domiciled in the plebiscite area, have been ordered to leave the area.British reports tend to show that this plebiscite will go overwhelmingly in favour of Germany.The plebiscite will be held on the 11th July.Danzig.The situation at Danzig has been critical ever since the ratification of the Peace Treaty, for the following reasons: (a.) The desperate economic coal and food situation in Danzig; Sir R. Tower and Lieut.-General Sir E. Haking have made frequent urgent representations that food should be supplied to the Free State. These have, so far, not been effective. The Poreign Office instructed Lord Derby on 23rd April to bring the matter before the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, recommending that food should be sent, and saying that we should be prepared to do our share, preferably on a commercial basis.(b.) The obstructionist policy of the Poles, vis-a-vis the Free State. This policy makes itself felt by stopping food supplies to Danzig from the Polish corridor, by increasing the difficulties of rail transit between Danzig and Pomerania, and by a continual policy of pin pricks on the Danzig-Polish frontier.(c.) The strikes and Communist agitation, due to the amount of unemployment in Danzig. (d.) The bitter anti-Polish feeling of the vast majority of the population of the Free State.The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the Poles have so far been quite unable to take over post, railway aud port control in Danzig, owing to&apos;lack of trained personnel. The principal Polish demands are the following: (i.) More effective Polish control in Danzig.(ii.) That Polish&apos; troops may be garrisoned in the Free State to protect its eastern frontier against aggression from Bast Prussia.(iii.) The disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei and the Einwohnerwehren in Danzig, and that Poles may be employed in any future police force that may be raised in the Free State.Sir E. Tower and Lieut.-General Sir R. flaking have both come to the conclusion that Article 104 of the Peace Treaty is unworkable.They both suggest the following alternative solutions: (i.) Danzig to become a neutral mandatory State under the protection of the League of Nations, with the mandate given to one of the Powers.- (ii.) Danzig to be annexed to Poland.Both agree that the first solution would be the best, but consider that the second solution is better than the Peace Treaty solution, as it would at least please the Poles, whereas the provisions of Article 104 please neither side.
At present both parties are thoroughly dissatisfied, and the situation may lead to bloodshed in the future. - Sir R. Tower has been to Paris and London and laid these views before the Conference of Ambassadors and the British Foreign Office. I &apos;,&apos; Sir R; Haking is of opinion that the Danzig population will never accept Polish rule, but will always oppose and intrigue against it.A constitution for the Free State has been framed, and elections took place on the 16th May and have resulted in a clear bourgeois majority. The Extreme Right (German National People&apos;s Party) and the Independent Socialists gained seats from the Moderates.  The Poles hold 7 seats out of 120.The Polish Government and the Free State have produced drafts for the Treaty between the. two States, which at present appear quite unreconcilable. /. Memel. -There appears to be little agitation at Memel, and no reports of disturbances have been received.Eupen and Malmedy.There has been considerable agitation recently in the districts of Eupen and Malmedy in consequence of the alleged intimidation by the Belgians of the German population who desire to exercise their right to record their desires as to the future status of these districts.This has culminated in demonstrations and strikes against the Belgian authorities in these districts with sympathetic strikes in other portions of occupied territory.The German Government have protested to the, League of Nations and to the Allied Governments regarding the decision of the Boundary Commission to, allot the Montjoie railway line to Belgium.1

&apos; ^ appendix in.     . , :POLITICAL SITUATION IN GERMANY, JUNE, 1920.1 &quot;. -   , 1. General.,   v :&apos;The political situation in Germany is so confused that it is difficult to draw any conclusions as to the probable course of events in the next few months,The country is still suffering from the effects of the Kapp coup d&apos;e&apos;tat and the subsequent Red rising in the Ruhr, nerves are on edge, and each class arid party bitterly distrusts and fears its opponents&apos;. In addition, the country has just passed through the throes of the general campaign for the Reichstag1 elections, and Press revelations, of impending counter-revolutionary or Spartacist outbreaks have been of almost daily occurrence.In fact, close reading of the German Press since the 1st April, without other sources of information, would have been apt to make one believe with certainty that civil war between the Reactionaries and the Spartacists would break out each succeeding week.Although the tone of the German.Press is exaggerated, there has been a serious weakening of the moderate Republican parties forming the old Coalition Government and a tendency to secede to the Right or Left.  This has been demonstrated by the results of the general election.(a.) The weakness of the Federal Ministry.One of the chief demands of the Kapp Party was the inclusion of expert Ministers in the former Coalition Government, and the need for reconstruction, of the former Government was. widely felt even before the March outbreak.Subsequently the former Coalitiou Government lost its two strongest members: Erzberger, undoubtedly the cleverest member of the Government, and Noske, the strong man. The replacement of Bauer by-Hermann Miiller as Chancellor did not add to its strength.It is generally held in Germany that the former Coalitiou Government consisted of mediocrities without any special knowledge and unfitted to cope with any reconstruction of the desperate internal and external situation of the country. .(b.) The economic situation.The lack of raw material makes it impossible for the industrial population to get back to work, andthis: is intensified by the shortage of coal and the transport crisis. American coal, imported into Bavaria for industrial purposes, recently cost 3,700 Marks per ton, which is of course a prohibitive price.The food situation, which is especially bad in the towns, is made worse by the hate and distrust felt by the country population for the Socialist workmen of the towns, which makes the peasants loath to supply the towns with food. The Government is apparently unable to compel the peasants to.supply the food, or to check the food profiteering which is rampant. There are universal complaints against the present system of food control and distribution. The coal production is bound to remain low while the miners do not receive&apos; adequate nourishment.   Without coal and raw material German industries cannot be restored.Profiteering traders are making fortunes and spending money on every luxury. This gives a false impression to the foreign visitor.. The middle class, professional men and officials and the labouring population are poorer than ever before;While food and work are lacking there is bound to be a recrudescence of Spartacist outbreaks. While the Government is unable to solve the problems of economic reconstruction a large proportion of the stable elements of tiie population are bound to welcome any successful attempt by the Extreme Right to overthrow the Government, with a view to establishing more effective Government control.(c.) Disarmament. A large proportion of the population is armed at the present time.No decrees of the Allies or of the German Government will be effective until it is evident to all that the German Government is strong enough to maintain order against the extremists of either party, and that it is not vital for the peaceable population to maintain its own means of self-defence.The German Government, even with strong forces concentrated in a confined area, as was the case in the Ruhr district, has proved unable to enforce the disarmament of the population (only 46,000 out of 90,000 rifles in the Ruhr area have been surrendered).The disarmament of the Spartacist workmen in Saxony and Central Germany and of the peasants in Bavaria will be a far more difficult problem to solve, especially with a reduced army and a demilitarized police force. Yet, while the bulk of the able-bodied manhood in Germany, already trained as soldiers, remain in possession of rifles, no Government can be immune from the possibility of armed insurrection..2. Causes Favouring a Fresh Reactionary Outbreak.In the Reichswehr there is much dissatisfaction amongst all ranks regarding their approaching demobilization. The discharged regular officers and long service non-commis:ioned officers ai e faced with a hopeless economic future; the men on discharge are faced with a boycott by the Trades Unions. The officers and non-commissioned officers are for the most part convinced Monarchists.1 The rank and file, largely recruited in the country districts, dislike the Socialist workmen of the towns, and their temper has become increasingly ugly during the frequent troubles of the last year. The Army, therefore, during the present process of reduction, is liable&apos; at any time to be led into fresh reactionary adventure.a number of the Baitic troops aud demobilized Reichswehr troops have found employment on the large estates in NorthrEast Germany, and would probably be ready to rise in case of a fresh outbreak. At the present time attempts are being made to form certain soldier settlements out of various refractory units, such as the Ehrhardt Marine Brigade, which have to be disbanded. But while the present unrest continues these settlements will oe danger centres.Monarchist feeling is certainly strong amongst the upper classes and in the country districts, but is hardly strong enough to lead to any definite outbreak.Landowners and peasants are bitterly opposed to the Governments agricultural policy. The bourgeoif-ie aie frightened of Government schemes for socialization, and the employers of labour in industrial centres feel that the present German Government is unable to bring about any improvement in the economic situation.__________...................In the south, particularly in Bavaria, there is real terror of the possibility of a fresh Spartacist outbreak such as occurred in Munich in the spring of 1919.  The question of the disbandment aud disarmament of the
Einwohnerwehren is felt very strongly, both by the bourgeoisie and the country population, which in Bavaria are practically solid for the retention of this force.There is a bitter anti-French feeling throughout Germany, which is also a danger to the German Government and favourable to any reactionary movement.3. Causes Favouring a Spaktacist Outbreak.In addition to the economic factors, lack of food and unemployment, there are other causes that may also lead to a fepartacist rising.A large body of the working class feels that it has been cheated of the results of the November revolution, and that its social conditions of life have not been bettered. Socialists and Communists are dissatisfied with the Government^ socialization policy; they realise that no effective reforms can be expected while the present moderate coalition remains in power.The workers dislike intensely the so-called Noske system and the whole military and police policy of the Government since the November revolution. The Extreme Left fear that the Military&apos;Party still has great influence with the German Government, and consider that this fact&apos; is proved by recent events in the Ruhr.There is undoubtedly a strong anti-militarist spirit amongst the working classes, and the Extreme Left feels that no adequate attempt has been made to cleanse the Reichswehr of reactionary elements and to punish the originators of the Kapp coup d&apos;e&apos;tat.The new national Bolshevism, combining a policy of Communist reforms with violent opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, as preached by the new Communist Labour Tarty, is bound to have attraction,4. Summary.None of these factors alone would appear sufficient to cause an immediate outbreak, either by the Right or Left. But taken in bulk they cannot but form a menace to the Government. As long as there is no fusion between the extremists of the Right and Left the danger of a rising of any magnitude is remote. But militarism plus Bolshevism would be a formidable combination.The present danger is rather from the Right. Any new outbreak must be more serious than the Kapp affair. It will be better organized and better directed as the result of the lessons of 13th March. A new outbreak by reactionaries will certainly include in its forecast the inevitable general strike of the town populations, and will have up its sleeve some counter-measure of blockade and starvation for the refractory.Recent events, however, show that the majority of the German population are both anti-militarist and anti-Bolshevist, and in this fact lies the chief hope for the future.5. Result of the Reichstag Elections on the (5th June, 1920. 4. (a.) As a result of the Reichstag Elections, held on .6th June throughout Germany, the present grouping of the parties is as follows: Extreme Right.	Right.		Centre.		Left.		Extreme Left.	German National People&apos;s Party.	German People&apos;s . Party. Guelphs.	bavarian Peasants&apos; Union.	Christian Federalists (Catholic).	Centre (Catholic).	Democrats.	Majority Socialists.	Independents. Communists.	66	B2             o	4 &apos;.	21	68	45 j	112	81	2	Probable new Coalition Government. . Total seats, 205.							Note. The Guelphs, Bavarian Peasants&apos; Union, Christian Federalists and eight Upper Silesians of the Centre (Catholic Party) have combined to form the &quot; Christliche Landespartei.&quot; They have 38 seats in the Reichstag.   This party is Federalist in character and opposed to over-centralization from Berlin.The strength of parties in the National Assembly* was as follows: Extreme Right.	Right.		Coalition Block (Centre and Left).			Extreme Left.	German National People&apos;s Party.	German People&apos;s Party.	Other parties.	Centre.	Democrats.	Majority Socialists.	Independents.

It is still impossible to give the composition of the new Federal Ministry.The Centre Deputy, Herr Fehrenbach, Speaker in the Reichstag and in the National Assembly, is attempting to form a Government, based on the support of the German People&apos;s Party, the Centre and the Democrats. As the total strength of these parties is only 205 in a House of 466 members, the existence of this Government must depend on the good will of either the German National People&apos;s Party (formerly Conservatives) which would mean a purely bourgeois and mainly reactionary Government or of the Majority Socialists, who are, however, unwilling to co-operate with the German People&apos;s Party (formerly National Liberals).* The former Parliament elected in January, 1919.
APPENDIX IV.:(A.)-Decisions of the Supreme Council at Boulogne, 22nd June, 1920.I. Disarmament, reduction of the German Army, increase in the German Civil Police Force, export of war material, and changes in German legislation.,,The Allied Governments have noted with the greatest regret the slowness and lack of good will shown by the German Government in the execution of the military, naval and air clauses of the Peace Treaty.      J &apos;On 22nd June, after a period of almost&apos; six months since the final ratification of the Treaty, the most important of these clauses have either not been carried out or have only been executed incompletely. For example, the regular army has only just been reduced to 200,000 men, an effective which it should have reached on 10th April, whilst its organization is not in accordance with that fixed by the Treaty; no law has been promulgated establishing in Germany a military state of affairs in conformity with the Treaty; the military formations forbidden by the Treaty, i.e., Sicherheitspolizei and Einwohnerwehr, still exist in spite of repeated demands for abolition ; the destruction of war material, which should have been completed by 10th March, is not yet half finished ; export of arms continues.The Allied Governments, after having carefully examined the situation, have unanimously decided to adhere completely to the clauses of the Treaty signed by Germany, both as regards her disarmament in effectives and in war material, and in insisting upon the immediate and complete execution of these clauses which has already-been far too long delayed. The Allied Governments further wish it to be understood that the German Government must make no further demand for modification in the military clauses of the Treaty; such demands can only receive a negative reply and consequently can only result in fresh delays.The Allied Governments are to-day* addressing to the President of the German Commission of Peace in Paris their reply to the request of the German Government to be allowed to keep an army of 200,000 men. This reply informs the German Government that the.military forces of Germany will be maintained at the figure of 100,000 men, as fixed by the Treaty, and with the organization laid down by this Treaty ; that the Sicherheitspolizei must be completely disbanded within a period of 3 months; and that on the other hand the strength of the German police forces is raised to 150,000 men, i.e., an increase of 70,000 on the figure of 1913.The Allied Governments further request the German Government (a.) To set up without any delay the legislation required by Article 211 of the Peace Treaty.(6.) To pass the necessary laws to forbid the export of war material to foreigncountries in accordance with Article 170. (c.) To disband effectively the formations of Einwohnerwehren which still exist inspite of the resolution of 8th April, and to carry out the surrender of the arms belonging to these formations.The Allied Governments wish it to be understood that no fresh delay must occur in the destruction of the war material, and that the execution of all the clauses regarding disarmanent, both in effectives and in material, should be completely carried out, without further postponement ; failing this, the Allied Governments would see themselves compelled to study the means required to ensure the complete execution of the terms of the Treaty.II. Sale of surrendered German War Material by the Reparations Commission.1. While waiting for the various interpretations of the attribution of the value of materials of all kinds transferred by Germany under the terms of Articles 169, 192 and 202 to be reconciled, it is essential that the disarmament of Germany should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.(83:6)* See paragraph B, page 52.E
2. Accordingly, the Reparations Commission is requested to proceed with the liquidation of all the material referred to in Articles 169, 192 and 202, with the exception of those reserved by the Allied and Associated Powers under the terms of the Treaty.3. The Military, Naval and Air Commissions of Control will hand over to the duly accredited agents of the Reparations Commission complete lists of all this material, the duty of fixing the technical conditions and rendering material unserviceable resting solely with these Commissions.4. The agents of the Reparations&apos;Commission shall be empowered to,, receive all sums, the proceeds of the sale of this material. A special account shall be opened for these sums, the distribution of which shall be settled later after a final decision has been reached on the question of the attribution now under discussion.(B.)-Note addressed to the President of the German Peace Commission in Paris by the Conference of Ambassadors (at Paris) on behalf of the Supreme Council, as a result of the Boulogne Conference of 22nd June, 1920.In a Note dated the 4th June, the German Government, on the plea that the Allied Powers have made no definite reply to their request of the 20th April for authority to retain a standing army of 200,000 men&apos;, addressed to the Conference a request for a provisional prolongation of the period of extension, expiring on the 10th July, which has been allowed to Germany for the reduction of the effective strength of her Army to the figure of 100,000 men. In support of their demand, the German Government laid special emphasis on the fact that &quot; according to the communication made to them by the Allied Governments regarding the proceedings of the San Remo Conference, no action need be taken until the Conference at Spa makes a definite decision regarding this request.&quot;The Allied Powers cannot accept this interpretation of the Note* which they addressed from San Remo to the German Government. They then clearly declared that they were unable even to examine the request put forward in the German Memorandum of the 20th April, so long as Germany failed to fulfil the most important obligations of the Treaty of Peace, and so long as she took no steps to carry out the disarmament of her army. There was nothing in their reply to give the German Government ground for the belief that they were authorized to suspend the application of measures, which should have been in course of execution since the 10th April, for the reduction of the strength of the German Army to 100,000 men.Besides, in extending to the 10th July the period of delay allowed for this operation, the Allies had fully taken into account the difficulties which Germany was legitimately entitled to put forward as an excuse for further postponement.In these circumstances the Allied Governments see no reason for consenting to a further extension of this period of delay. Consequently, they purely and simply confirm their previous decisions: the Military Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles concerning the German Army, both from the point of view of its effective strength and from that of its organization and armament, are maintained in their integrity; they must be strictly executed.While they are resolved to insist on the disarmament of German)&apos; in accordance with the stipulations of the Treaty, the Powers do not, however, fail to recognize the necessity for leaving at the disposal of the German Government, police forces sufficient to ensure the maintenance of internal order. In this connection they willingly recognize that the normal police forces, if they were maintained at their strength of 1913, would not be sufficiently numerous to meet all requirements. The Allied Governments are ready to authorize their increase, but they could, under no pretext, allow this-increase to be carried into, effect by the maintenance of the Sieherheitspolizei, a force of police essentially military both in character and organization, and one which Germany has been requested to disband since the month of December, 1919. &apos; This disbandment must be completed within a period of three months from the date of the presentation of this Note.On the other hand, the Allies agree to the strengthening of the former police force, known as the Ordnungspolizei.   The Ordnungspolizei at the present moment comprises* See Annexe No. 5, page 24.
-    20 (J92,000, men ; the Powers consent to its increase to the figure of 150,000 men, but this concession is made subject to the following conditions which must be strictly fulfilled : The Ordnungspolizei will retain its character as a regional and municipal body, It will not receive in any degree or in any way a centralized organization. It will be given an armament corresponding to its&apos; r61e, which will be determined by the Inter-Allied Commission of Control. Further, it must be clearly understood -that, in the strength of 150,000 sanctioned for the Ordnungspolizei, are included^ the 10,000 men authorized by the Inter-Allied Commission of Control for the policing of the Neutral Zone.The increase of the Ordnungspolizei will, moreover, not take effect either in the territories on the left bank of the Rhine where the Rhineland High Commission lias the sole authority to fix the necessary effectives or in the plebiscite areas, so long as the Inter-Allied Control aud Plebiscite Commissions do not expressly demand it.Finally, the increase of the effectives of the Ordnungspolizei will be carried out step by step in proportion to the disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei. At no given moment, may the total of the effectives of the Sicherheitspolizei and the Ordnungspolizei exceed 150,000 men. On the other hand, the Powers have decided to authorize the German Government, in accordance with the demand they have addressed to the Commission of Control, to increase from 12,000 to 17,000 men the effectives of the Gendarmerie,The Allies desire to draw the attention of the German Government to the fact that, during the three months which will elapse between the date of the presentation of this Note and the final disbandment of the Sicherheitspolizei, they are unable to allow military personnel, on discharge from the Reichsvjehr, to be incorporated in the Sicherheitspolizei; the present effective strength of the latter constitutes a maximum figure which must be progressively reduced.The Inter-Allied Commission of Control is empowered to superintend the application of these different measures, which are of a kind to give entire satisfaction to the legitimate demands of the German Government.I have, &amp;c,
