I jfPJ]5213) &quot;From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2nd July 1920.(Received 4th, 10 a.ra.)Clear the line.812 S. Secret. Afghanistan.. In continuation of our telegram&apos; of 3rd July, 808 S. As a general proposition we should view with whole-hearted approval, opening up and development of Afghanistan, especially railways and telegraphs, as advantage to both countries, and if this were accomplished with our aid, it should, as Dobbs points out, establish our influence beyond fear of rivalry. But before em-barking on large programme of extensive assistance, it is clearly essential to have some guarantee of continuity of policy,, and recent events have shown that AmanuhVs tenure of the throne is none two secure. While therefore we should be careful to avoid discouragement of Afghan aspirations in any way, we are inclined to think that, if the Afghan delegates make official proposals such as Dobbs indicates, most he should be instructed to say in reply at present stage is that His Majesty&apos;s Government authorise him to announce that they view Afghan desire for the development of their country with the utmost sympathy. They would, moreover, be prepared to consider as part of a treaty of friendship- grant of reasonable assistance for development, such as construction of railway to Kandaliar, and education of young Afghans in Europe, but obviously they cannot commit themselves to any promise until concrete proposals, are before them, and until they are assured (? of the sincerity of) Afghan friendship. It must be remembered that India, and indeed whole of British Empire are crying out for financial and other assistance for their industrial development which has been starved and hindered by five years of war. The calls upon His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore very great, and the Afghan delegates will readily admit that first duty of every Government lies towards its own subjects. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already given proof of their genuine desire to assist Afghanistan by authorising renewal of former subsidy on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, and this is an earnest goodwill with which they would regard Afghan request for further assistance,. in promoting development of their country. But beyond this assurance of sympathy and goodwill they cannot go at present stage.If in making this statement of policy Dobbs could at the same time be authorised to announce one or two small gifts which the British would be prepared to make on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, it would, we suggest, have the happiest effect, for to the Oriental mind some tangible token of sincerity of our intentions will convey far more than most emphatic verbal assurances. Such gifts as we have in mind are telegraphic material, a wireless station, motor lorries or the loan of an irrigation expert.. All or any of these would cost comparatively little and would mean much.to the Afghans.
