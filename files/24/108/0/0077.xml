$yejj.   J j(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF - HIS  RITANHIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT)COPY W.E C R iti T.illCP. 1574.(b.s.g.6). CABINS T.&apos;  &apos;    BREAD SUBSIDY.Note &quot;by the Chancellor,of the Exchequer c oyer ingTiemorandum by the ffha chairman, Royal Commission on V/heat Supply.I beg my colleagues attention to Lord Crawford&apos;s important memorandum.   An early decision is required.   I think that a.statement of policy should be made on the Third Readinr of the Finance Bill when.the subject is sure to be raised.(Intd.)   A.C.Treasury, S.V.&quot;.,July 6th, 1920.Chancellor of the Exchequer.In reply to&apos; your questions as to the latest estimate of the Bread Subsidy, as to economies realisable by its termination at various dates, and as to the effect on administration and bread prices, I submit the following observations on June 14 the Cabinet decided that wheat harvested in the Autumn of 1921 should receive world prices; hitherto our farmers have received less than world prices.   It is clear that so long as a Subsidy exists this decision must involve a paymentjf on imported wheat. , So great are the technical and political obstacles that it is agreed that the Bread Subsidy
-   276cannot survive the marketing of the earliest.home-grown whsat of 1921 - say early in August of that year.W Effect of Immediate Abolition of Subsidy. During the first three months of the present financial year we have only spent about  -8,000,000 of the  45,000,000 sanctioned for the whole year.   As our earlier and cheaper purchase contracts are exhausted, the weekly rate of subsidy rises accordingly.   Were the subsidy abolished at once (which presents no administrative difficulty) flour would have to be advanced from 63/6 to 100/6 per sack, equiv-alent to bread at l/4-fd.&apos; or in practice l/5d per quartern loaf., against to-day&apos;s price of l/ijd.   Meanwhile .1 assume that the remanent of English wheat harvested last autumn would there-upon fetch world prices, insteae of the present maximum of 90/- and new wheat from August next onwards would likewise command world prices, (k) Abolition on July 50thc   We shall then have spent about  12,000,000 and flour would have to be raised, to 102/3d. per sack, or the equiva- -lent of l/5d. per quartern., (c) Abolition on August 51.   New English wheatwould be on sale at world prices.   We shall then have spent about  20,000,000 and bread would be at l/5d. per quartern, id) Abolition on September 30th.- During the first half of the financial year we shall have spent about  26,r*00,000-   v;e should thenceforward have thread at l/5d- (as above),.   I must remind -you that the present estimated cost of the Bread Subsidy (namely  57,500,000) has to be curtailed during the Autumn to the authorised figure of  45,000,000.&apos;   About the end of September there-fore we shall in&apos; any case advance flour by 12/-
a sack, which is equivalent to l/1-Jd. per four-pound loaf.Abolition on March 51, 1921, at close of financial year.   There will of course be no further sating as we shall h&amp;vc brought -our expendi-;bure withii the authorised limit (see d) .(f) Abolition by August 1, 1921, that is when the earliest English wheat sown this Autumn reaches the market.   It id impossible to forecast the outlay during these first four months of the financial year 1921-22, but it will probably be as high as  15,000,000. The longer abolition is postponed the more it will be discounted, but the smaller must be the saving to the Exchequer and credit to the Government.   Though a long de^ ferred economy would produce little outcry to-day, it would almost inevitably inflict a greater blow upon humble con-sumers later on, and thus entail more serious industrial re-actions than if action were taken promptly.   The Bread Sub-sidy is doomed, and it should be ended during the Summer when the climate should be mild and foodstuffs plentiful still more before commercial depression has set in.   To announce abolition many months hence might well provoke censure from taxpayers as s whole: for no tangible saving would be achieved, while our political successors would have to face the odium or would be free to reverse the policy.As regards the effect of ending the subsidy on the average Artisan Budget, the Ministry of Labour estimate that an increase of eight points on the Index number would result. (Dr. Macnamara&apos;s Memorandum 29/6/20),The Ministry of Pood (series 9 Retail prices 1920 F/C 20/5/20) estimate that the average artisan family, consisting of a married couple
and three children, consume twenty-one pounds of bread and eight pounds.&apos; of flour weekly.   Abolition of the Bread Subsidy roughly speaking entails an advance of Id. per pound - or 3ay 2/6d. a week for the average family.As a reduction of taxation by, 30 or 40 millions would probably stimulate employment, or at any rate postp6ne unemployment, the abolition of the Bread Subsidy would not be wholly injurious to wage-earners.(Signed)   CRAWFORD &amp; BALCARRES.5/7/20.
