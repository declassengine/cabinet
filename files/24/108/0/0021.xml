This Docnmcot is the Pioperty ofill--  .r JJ...-;^,0jverpmenL5;72CONFIDENTIALCAB DIET.EXPORT CP COAL TO FOREIGI COUNTRIESiNote by the President of the Board of Trade.T.rith reference to C*P, 1407 circulated by the Foreign Office, I attach a memorandum on the Export of Coal to Foreign Countries and a note of the meeting of the Depart -mental Committee.As will be seen from these papers, it is impossible at present to increase the quantity of coal available for export. I appreciate the anxiety of the Foreign Office to conciliate our Allies on this question, but that could only be done by a serious curtailment of our home supplies and a reimpositiorf of the control which has just been relaxed.RoS. HORNE23rd June, 1920.
1.    The departmental memoiandum, of which a copy is attached (Annexure A) embodies ,the results of the Conference held on the 11th May, to which reference is made in paragraph 1 of the Foreign Office memorandum of June 1st (CP.1407).2, The allocation of the exportable surplus which is osti-mated at not more than 1,750,000 tons per month is set forth in tho attached table (Annexure B) * This appears to be the most equitable distribution practicable In view of our obli-gations to France and Italy and the imperative necessity of maintaining supplies for tho Coaling Stations,3.    The tables attached to the Foreign Office report show certain figures as the minimum monthly requirements of France Italy, etc,    It is fir ther noted that in the case of France and Egypt the figures are given as the minimum requirements from the United Kingdom.    It is to be observed that these figures are based merely upon the dicta of the French and Italian Representatives.      Although they claimed 1,500,000 and 500,000 t6ns as their respective.monthly minima of British coal, the present allocations, namely 750,0^0 and 350,000 tons respectively have been accepted by the French at the Hythe Conference and by the Italians at a recent meeting with the Coal Controller,    France has other resource: - her own mines, impaired though they ore, and the reparation coal from Germany.    Again, both France and Italy draw very considerable quantities from America *    Egypt not only draws from America but has open to her other sources of supply, namely South Africa and India; during the war her require-ments were very largely met from South Africa.    Annexure MC&quot; shows recent, exports from America to Europe,    Italy recently cancelled ah   order of half a million tons from the U.S.A,, and it has&apos;since been reported that she has refused an offer of South African coal,4.     It is apparently suggested that we should reduce our own consumption in order to provide moro liberally for foreign countries.    The Coal Mines Department has been guided by the policy of H.M. Government as laid down by the Leader of tho House in an answer to a Parliamentary question given on the 16th February, 1920.     It was then stated that it was the policy of the Government to permit the export only of the balance of coal remaining after transfer from surplua dis-tricts to meet home requirements so far as transport con-&apos; ditions permitted.    Mr. Bonar Law further stated in reply to a supplementary question that the largest amount of export possible ought to be maintained, but   we cannot allow either householders or industries to suffer&quot;.     In pursuance of this policy the efforts of the Coal Mines Department during the last three months have been directed to maintain Inland supplies and only that coal has been permitted to be exported which could not be utilised inland.    Yet, notwithstanding th reduction of our monthly export from over 3i millions in January to less than 2 millions home demands have oven now not been fully met.    Moreover, with the approval of the Cabinet, the inland distribution of coal ha3 been freed from control with effect from June 7th.    If it were decided that home consumption must be restricted or reduced in order to meet foroign demands it would be necessary to re-Impose rationing both for household and industrial purposes in a&apos; far more drastic form, involving Vne setting up of elaborate machinery and the employment of a very greatly increased s t a f i *
JEZPOIIT   0?   OQiL   gQ   FOREIGN   COUITTRL^JS.Hote of a Heating at the Board of Trade on 11th May, 1920, &quot;between the Board of Trade, The Foreign Office and the Ministry of Shipping.The toal exportable Eurplus for the rest of tho year 1920 ia estimated at not more than 1,750,000 tone per month and of this it is proposed that not more than three-sevenths should so to Prance and one-fifth to Italy.The Goal Mines Department pointed out that if home demands are to be maintained (and so far home demands have not been fully met) it will not be possible to export more, and the onlv relief than can be given to Italy will be at the expense of France,The foreign Office suggested that inland supplies should be curtailed In order, on international grounds, to assist France and Italy, but this view oould not be accepted by the Board of Trade, the Goal Mines Department or the Ministry of Shipping.The Foreign Office also mentioned a request for help from Portugal, Sweden etc     The 0o.al Mines Department stated that   if an attempt was to be made to allocate the exportable surplus to more destinations than France and Italy, there seemed no alteraa-tive to the Government tailing over the whole of the exportable surplus and selling it as the Government thought best.      Such action ia, at the present time, hardly to be considered, but no other action would gire the machinery adequate to carry out the detailed allocations to more destinations than two.The Ooal Mines Department was strongly of opinion that the trade would not itself be able to oarry out such an arrangement.The Ooal Mines Department representatives pointed out that there was evidence to show that Italy was ceasing to buy coal in this Country in view of supplies coming forward from ixnerica.    This would be altered li time when it became clear that the iymerioan supplies were very limited, but in the mean-time Italy would lose coal from this Country which she would not be able to replace.4S regards Coke and Patent Fuel,, it was pointed out that France had been receiving very large quantities of this, but that the export of Ooke was now, and must oontinue to be, severely restricted.Figures are attached shewing the average quantities of ooal exported eaoh month for various periods, from which it will be seen that under the proposed arrangements Italian supplies from this Country will compare much less favourably with her pre-war supplies from this Country than in the case of France, despite the fact that France has sources of supply in her own country,  -in Germany and in Belgium which are not available for Italy.Mr. Bridgeman (in the Chair) Col.
