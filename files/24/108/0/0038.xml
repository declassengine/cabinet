This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.J1 &apos;\SECRET.^OTIhA^ THE WAR OFFICE ON ITS FINANCIAL ^^^SMMlONS WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT. .MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR,I circulate to my colleagues.a Note prepared in the War Office on its finanical relations with the Egyptian Government. It is beyond question, as the Financial Adviser to that Government recognizes, that Lord Cromer&apos;s fixed contribution of 150,000/. a year to Army Funds is now completely out of date. It&quot; appears to me that the practical question is not so much what sum Egypt is in principle liable to pay, as what is the largest sum there is any real prospect of extracting from her. This, and the question whether the present is an opportune time for opening a discussion of the subject, are* questions which go far beyond the sphere of the War Office and are for the consideration of the Cabinet.w. s. c.The War Office,25th June, 1920.. 1. There are several financial questions of importance now requiring settlement with the Egyptian Government.A. Egypt&apos;s Contribution to the Charges of the Great War.2. On the 6th November, 1914, when Turkey had entered the war, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, under instructions from the Foreign Office given without reference to the War Office (though Lord Kitchener, who then still held the post of High Commissioner, is understood to have been personally consulted), issued a proclamation stating that &quot; Great Britain takes upon herself the sole burden of the present war, without calling upon the Egyptian people for aid therein.&quot;3. In 1915, the possibility of some contribution from the Egyptian Exchequer was mooted, and questions arose in the War Office as to the meaning, in this connection, of &quot; the burden of the present war,&quot; which seemed to be interpreted by the Egyptian Government as covering not only direct out-of-pocket expenditure on the war, but also charges constructively due to it. The then Financial Adviser to the Egyptian Govern-ment, in a report to the Foreign Office, said that while under the terms of. the proclamation no contribution could be claimed from Egypt, there were good prospects of a substantial voluntary contribution, and he himself would be prepared to advise one; that in the meantime large payments from Egyptian funds were being placed to a Suspense Account instead of being reclaimed currently from the British Government, and preferential treatment was being&apos; given to the British forces in respect of certain customs dues, telegraphs and railway charges. The matter was thereupon left in abeyance by agreement between the Treasury, Foreign Office and War Office, until the question of incidence of the charges placed to Suspense Account should come up for determination at the end of the war.4. In 1917, the High Commissioner again held out hopes of either a direct money contribution by the Egyptian Government or an enlargement of the classes of items which were being placed to Suspense Account, with a view to their being borne in whole or in part by Egypt.5. In March, 1918, the Egyptian Government made a definite offer to accept the whole of the items in Suspense up to 31st March, 1918 (about 3,000,000/E.), and to provide a further 500,000/E. for similar items in 1918-19. It is to be noted that this offer did not take either of the forms foreshadowed by the High Commissioner in 1917.(B20/280)   100  6/20  HiS   8313wo
Examination of the &quot; Suspense Account&quot; showed that it included (a.) About 1,500,000/E. spent on railway developments. These works were to a large extent related to the defence of Egypt itself against invasion (which was not in immediate prospect when Sir John Maxwells proclamation of 1914 was issued), and would seem to possess considerable value to the Egyptian Government for peace purposes. .(6.) About 500,000 E. . military expenditure on suppression of the rising in Darfur. But the Treasury had already ruled in 1916 (against the view of the Egyptian Government) that these operations, though connected with the war, were not a part of &quot; the present war &quot; within the meaning of the proclamation, but were a local concern of the Egyptian and Sudan Govern-ments.(c.) About 500,000/E.&apos; for increased cost of civil administration arising out of war conditions.(d.) About 155,000/E. for maintenance of interned aliens, political prisoners, &amp;c, while in Egypt. All expenditure on internment camps in Egypt not directly attributable to these aliens, &amp;c, and all expenses in Malta (to which these aliens were removed) have been borne by the British Government, though in principle the latter at all events would seem chargeable to Egypt.6. Unless, therefore, it is held that the proclamation was tantamount to a guarantee to indemnify the Egyptian Government against all expenditure connected with the war even against such items as have fallen upon the Governments of neutral States the larger part of the so-called &quot;contribution&quot; consists of charges which properly fall upon the Egyptian Exchequer; so.that the expectations of a generous contribution to the cost of the war have not been fulfilled.7. In this connection the following extract from the Note of the Financial Adviser (Sir Paul Harvey) on the Egyptian Budget of 1920-21 is of interest: &apos;Supplement atj Journal Offi6iel No. 29 du Jeudi ler Avril, 1920.Note of the Financial Adviser on the Budget of 1920-21.The economic situation of Egypt at the present day presents a number of features of considerable interest. Egypt is one of the very few countries in this hemisphere which derived little but economic advantage from the war. While the citizens of every nation in Europe, whether belligerent or neutral, have suffered heavily, if not from the operations of war itself, at least from increased taxation, high prices and restraint of trade, Egypt has on the whole received substantial benefits. The price of its chief product has risen to heights previously unknown, taxation has remained nearly stationary, and its adoption as a base for military operations has been a source of much commercial profit.^ome measure of this additional wealth may be gathered from the statistics of Egypt&apos;s foreign investments during the period 1915-19 .    ,  E.Investments by Government and Public Custodian        ... 13,000,000Investments on account of bank-note issue...       ...      ... 65,000,000Investments by banks and mortgage companies    ...      ... 60,000,000Investments by companies and private individuals...... 14,000,000Total      ............   152,000,000B. Military charges in connection with the Civil disturbances of 1919.8. The retention in Egypt of British and Australasian troops owing to the riots of the spring of 1919, caused extra expenditure during that year amounting to about 6 millions, of which about J million relates to Australian and New Zealand troops. The extra charge is so heavy because the great majority of the troops concerned were withheld from demobilization, so that their whole cost was extra. The Treasury, in August 1919, expressed to the Foreign Office the view that this military expenditure due to domestic troubles might properly be reclaimed from Egypt, and the matter has
been under the consideration of Lord Allenby, who is asking for details of expenditure. In view of the very large sum involved, time devoted to detailed investigation at the present stage seems likely to be unprofitably spent.9. The view of the Dominion Governments, expressed officially through the Colonial Office, is that the Dominions are- entitled to a refund of the expenses thrown upon them, whether the Imperial Government succeeds in recovering the money from egypt or not. This position has been communicated to the Treasury by the Colonial Office (November, 1919). -- 10. It is to be observed that in the early years of the Egyptian annual Military Contribution (nee paragraph 15 below),.the principle was adopted that while extra military expenditure incurred on Imperial objects, such as the relief of Gordon, was wholly British, that incurred for the security of Egypt against raids by Dervishes, &amp;c, should be paid by Egypt in addition to the normal annual contribution.C. War Gratuities to British Personnel with the Egyptian Army.11. The Egyptian Government, in September, 1919, had agreed that war gratuities paid on the British scale to British officers and men attached to the Egyptian Army during the war should be refunded by the Egyptian Government. The amount involved is about 250,000/. The High Commissioner, in a dispatch to the Foreign Office dated 21st February, 1920, now desires to withdraw from this undertaking on the ground that such payments would give rise to claims to similar gratuities for all native officers and men, the refusal of which would greatly aggravate the difficulties of the present local political situation.12. It is not denied that there may be force in this argument, but it is considered that a way should be found of making an equivalent contribution in some other form to the British Exchequer.D. Egypt&apos;s Annual Military Contribution to Army Funds.13. From the year 1882 onwards, Egypt has annually made a payment to Army Funds in respect of the cost of the British troops in the country. This contribution has. at different times been assessed in different ways, having at first been worked out on the basis of the numbers of troops actually maintained during the year, and at a later period having been fixed by estimate at a commuted figure for a series of years ; but in principle it has always represented the extra cost of maintaining troops in Egypt as compared with home. The liability of Egypt was defined by the Treasury in 1885 as covering &quot; all extra expenditure which the retention of the Queens troops in Egypt for police purposes is calculated to entail on the Exchequer of the United Kingdom,&quot; in this respect differing from the liability of a Crown Colony, such as Hong Kong or Singapore, where the limit of the Colonial military contribution is nob the extra,- but the whole, cost of the garrison. In this connection, extra cost has been interpreted to mean the difference in cost (between Egypt and home) of the numbers of officers and men on the Home Establishment of an infantry battalion Or other unit, together with the whole cost of any officers and men added to the Home Establishment in order to bring the unit up to &quot; Colonial&quot; establishment.14. Thus, at the base of the whole calculation lies the theory that the British Army contains a fixed number of battalions and other units which, if not employed in Egypt, would be maintained (though it may be on a lower establishment) at home. This theory no longer holds good under present conditions. Apart from any question of possible reductions in the pre-war numbers of British cavalry regiments, infantry battalions, &amp;c, there are now, in addition to some 10,000 British troops, about 20,000 Indian troops in Egypt which, if not so employed, would be returned to India for immediate dishandment. Allowing for the intended reduction of the latter to half these numbers during the year, the extra cost of the garrison to the British Exchequer, for Indian troops alone, will still be at least 4 millions this year.15. The contribution originally assessed in 1882, after Arabi&apos;s rebellion, was 278,000/. for the period October, 1882, to March, 1883. For 1883-84 it was 334,000/. From 1885 to 1888 the strength of the garrison averaged about 6,000, and the contribution was 200,000/. a year. Reduction of the garrisou to about 3,300, and rising prices at home, then brought the contribution down to about 87,000/. a year. Nothing was paid by Egypt for the troops employed in the Gordon Relief Expedition of 1885 ; but on the other hand an additional payment was made in 1889-90 in respect of the cost of ft, Dervish raid. In the early years of the present century the extra cost began to rise again, and in 1907, on the recommendation of Lord Cromer, the contribution was &quot;fixed at 150,000/. a year, representing (at then price levels and rates of pay) the extra
cost of a garrison of about 5,700. This figure has since remained unchanged, though the garrison had in 1914 grown to about 6,300 and cost per head was rising. The total cost of that garrison at the then levels of prices and pay was about three-quarters of a million. .16, The sum to-day involved, even on the extra cost basis, is (as shown above) so greatly increased, and the political difficulty of an unlimited military contribution is so evident, that it appears necessary for a decision to be taken on general &quot;policy before exact calculations can be profitably made.E. Customs Dues,   n17. Connected with the question of military contribution is that of the customs dues leviable on army imports into Egypt. Before the war, duty was paid from army funds on dutiable articles imported for the public service, if they were of the character of general merchandise (provisions, &amp;c), but not on arms or other specifically warlike stores. The duties so paid were, however, reckoned as a factor of extra cost in calculating the amount of the military contribution, so that as long as that contribu-tion adequately covered the extra cost, no duties on imports for the public service were in effect paid ; but this has not been the position for many years past,18. During the war, relaxations were secured locally which, while not taking the form of complete exemption of all public army imports (e.g., imports for the army arriving as part of mixed cargoes in ordinary merchant vessels were still liable), had practically that effect.19. The question of future peace arrangements hits been under discussion locally, and Sir Paul Harvey, recognizing that any dues levied on public army imports are properly recoverable as part of the military contribution, and that the 150,000/. fixed in Lord Cromers time must now be revised, has advised that the Egyptian Govern-ment should waive all claim to duty in respect of goods the property of the British Government imported into Egypt for the use of the army.   This is satisfactory.20. A further question has arisen as to duties on gocds of dutiable character imported for the private use of the troops, either by the Canteen organization or by individual officers and men; but this does not affect the British Exchequer and is being dealt with separately. A technical question-as to the mode of fixing the rates charged for services rendered to the British forces by the Egyptian State Kailways is also under senarate reference to a Board of Arbitration.CONCLUSION.21. It is suggested, as? a basis for discussion, that the liability of Eeypt as regards annual Military Contribution remains in principle as defined by the Treasury in 1885 (paragraph 13 above), regard being had, within the maximum so arrived at, to taxable capacity ; and that in view of the abounding prosperity indicated in paragraph 7, if the action referred to in paragraph 5 is regarded as finally disposing of the expected contribution to the cost of the war, then a substantial sum should be forthcoming in respect of the civil disturbances of last year, in fixing which the obligation in regard to gratuities (paragraph 11) might properly be taken into account.June, 1920.
