EXECUTION OP TEE TREATY OF PEACE&quot;     IWiscti;----------&quot; Memorandum for the Supreme- Council of the&apos; Allied Governments drawn up by the t&amp;ilj tax yAeronautic and $aval Representatives of Belgium,; Great Britain, PranceItaly and Japan*(Approved by the Supreme Council at Brussels, on Saturday,July 5rd, 1920,The principal violations or non-executions of the Treaty are as given beloweThe integral execution of the clauses dealt Tilth in this memorandum, which is indispensable in order to ensure the disarma-ment of Germany, must be carried out at once,A. Military Clauses^1.   Under the Terms of-Article 211, after the expiration, of a period of three months which terminated on April 10th, the German laws were to have been modified and maintained by the German Government in conformity. with the Military Clauses of the Treaty,&apos; which forbid.all military, personal and compulsory service,, and only permit recruitment for&quot; long terms of sbrvice (Article 174)&apos; Ho legislative action has yet been taken by the tferaian Government in this matter and, not only have these laws not yet been passed,&apos;but the Germans are still continuing short-term recruitment in the Reichwehr -(Active Army), and come units have in this way renewed half their effective strength within a period of four months.2,   Under the Terms of Article 170, the manufaetAire for, and export to, foreign countries of arms, munitions and war material of every kind are strictly prohibited.This article is constantly violated, and, in spite of the reposed   demands of the Commission of? Control, no legislative measures haveheen taken to ensure its execution.
I   262Sv The Micteass^      to be &quot;rsdtio^t^^ At the proee-nt date no mea^res&quot; had yet been taken to carry out this&apos; reduction, and, as its execution will&apos;take some time,. If Trill he im- -possible to complete it by the date fixed. -Moreover, contrary to the terms off the $peaty, heavy artillery has been maintained in the Reichstirehr, which also includes a larger number of staff than those authorised, as well as staffs the existence of which is not allowed1The formations of Einwohnerwehren (Civic Guards) the dis-bandment of which has been demanded of the German Government since 1st December,. 1919, still exist in very large numbers, in spite of all representations made by the Commission of Control since the coming in-to force of the treaty.    These     formations constitute real reserves, and a lar^e proportion of their members are armed.    This state of affairs. rs is a violation of the stipulations of Article 178 of the Treaty, which forbids &quot;all measures appertaining to mobilisation&quot;.4.   UnCer the terms of Article 169. all German war material in excess of the quantities allowed, had to be surrendered, to be de^-troyed (or rendered useless) by March, 10th. -At &apos;,the present datev in spite of the efforts of the Commission of Control, there still remains undelivered a large quantify of this material, mainly small arms, the numbers of which,, as declared by the erman Government, axe Undoubtedly too low.This undelivered material, added to that already surrendered but not ,yet destroyed, totals an extremely important amount for des-truction.This situation.^ brought about by the obstruction shewn by German -Government officials to the efforts of the Commission of Con-trol, constitutes a definite violation of Article 169,, the execution of which is now three months overdue, a delay which is increasing day by day.Moreover, the German Government, without adequate procf, claims to have destroyed before the 5th January, 1920, a very largo amount&apos;of war material.    The proof of this destruction must bodefinitely/&apos;
Jdefinitely established by the  ea^li-e&amp;t possible dat-e^ otherwise there will be justification for the belief that this material hao been concealed, which ^ould constitute a violation of the some article.Finally,, the quantities of Allied war material declared by the German Government to be in its possession are clearly insufficient,,- 3 -
B. AIR CLAUSES.Article 202 lays down that all military, and naval aeronautical material must be delivered within a period, of three months, expiring on 10th April 1920. The remarks made with reference to Article 169 of the Military Clauses apply generally to this Article, which has not &quot;been carried out within the prescribed period.Moreover, recent searches have led to the discovery of important quantities of hidden material (54 aeroplanes, over 4,000 engines etc.).   Prom this fact, and judging by the amount of aeronautical material approximately known at the date of the Armistice, the conclusion as to the existence of a large amount of hidden material is justified.   This would constitute a fresh violation of the same Art icle.Finally it has been established that very large quantities of aeronautical material have been exported, a fact which- cons&amp;itutas yet another violation of Article 202,
lC. NAVAL CLAUSES-I. Article 209 lays dovrn that the German Authorities must hand to the Commission of Control all the information and docu-ments that it deems to be necessary.Despite the insistence of the Commission,, not a document or Plan has been handed over. Moreover on 2nd Kay, 1920 the German Authorities&apos;refused to deliver any documents or plans other than those vrhich they consider necessary&quot;.Admitting that it is obviously impossible to assure.the execution of the Treaty without documents. This attitude indicates a definite intention not to carry out the engagements of the TreatyII. Article 204 and 206 authorise the -Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control to inspect the 35V. ctories for the manufacture of naval  material.   These inspections have met with grave and con-tinual difficulties caused by the representatives of the German Government,Moreover, it has been shown, in the course o^ visits which have been made that an important quantity of naval material has been concealed.III. In conformity with Article 192 the Kaval -rar material re-ferred to in this Article should have been surrendered to the Principal Allied and Associated Powers.   In carrying out the des-truction of a part of this material without the knowledge of the Commission, the German Authorities have committed an infraction of the Treaty.Finally, the warships should, in accordance with Article 185 have been delivered by 10th ::&apos;arch, 1920. Although it is not possible definitely to establish that the non-surrender of the war-ships by this date constitutes a violation of the Treaty, it is nevertheless certain that the necessary dispositions for effecting the surrender of the ships have not been made. In consequence of this delay certain warships whi ch were l:nxra to be in -^ood con-dition have been allowed to deteriorate and are actually useless.sels,2nd July. 1920. - 5 -&quot;
