Departmental. .Employment Exchanges: The Employment Position.The general course of employment during the second quarter of 1920 has shown comparatively little substantial alteration.&apos; As measured by the registers of the Employ-ment Exchanges, there has been a gradual, but not very marked, decline in the number of workers unemployed. On the 26th March, the rapid recovery which followed upon the settlement of the strike among ironmoulders had reduced the total number of workers registered at the Exchanges to about 372,000. The number registered on the 18th June was 317,000, a decline of close on 15 per cent.* In this total the workers in the insured industries bear to those in the uninsured trades a proportion of roughly one to two. The total number of workers registered, if compared with the estimated total numbers., employed in industry, indicates for all the workers of the country an approximate unemploy-ment rate of 1*8 per cent.* The great improvement in the situation during 1919 and 1920 may be measured by the fact that early in May, 1919, when unemployment was at its highest, nearly 1,243,000 workers were on the Exchange-registers.(c 2021)  150  7/20  h &amp; S 1 2 M
The decline in unemployment continues to be most marked among men, to whom, in fact, it is almost entirely confined. On the 26th March, a little less than 302,000 men were registered at the Exchanges. The total had been reduced by the 18th June to roughly 249,000, a fall of 17*5 per cent. Among women, on the other hand, the level of unemploy-ment has varied much less, the total on the 26th March standing at a little over 50,000, and on the 18th June roughly at 47,400, a fall of 5*5 j)er cent. Reports from the Exchanges indicate that the registers contain a large number of married women whose position is not such as to render them generally available for employment, while large numbers of the remainder are unskilled workers whom it is difficult to place. In many directions, as for example, in the woollen, worsted and textile trades of the West Riding, the lace and hosiery trades of the Nottingham and Derby districts, and the textile industries of the North-Western Division, there is still a general demand for experienced operatives which cannot be met. There are signs, however, that the great activity in the staple industries of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, is now slackening, and it is not expected that the position of women&apos;s employment will show any great improvement in the im-mediate future. The number of juvenile applicants registered at the Exchanges has shown, though in a less degree than during the earlier part of the year, the oscillations due to the fixing of the school-leaving period, but the average level of unemployed juveniles registered at the Exchanges has shown little change during the period under review.It still remains the case that the majority of the men registered for employment at the Exchanges are men who have served in the Forces. On the 11th June, when there were 257,400 men registered at the Exchanges in Great Britain, there were some 187,600 ex-Service men still in receipt of out-of-work donation. * This figure shows a fairly substantial decline since the latter days of March, for, on the 26th of that month there were over 237,500 ex-Service men receiving donation. Allowance must be made for the fact that the period of unemployment, in a large proportion of cases, has not, considering the circumstances, been very prolonged ; nearly 95,000 men of the 187,000 mentioned above were still drawing donation under the original scheme, and have therefore, not been unemployed-for more than 156 days since demobilisation. At the same time, a considerable number of men have been out of work for much longer periods.In view of the very large number of men demobilised, the proportion of ex-Service men unemployed is small, but it is sufficiently large to merit all the attention which can be given to it by the Ministry. The Local Employment Committees, who, during recent Weeks have been specially asked to give their attention to the problem of the re-employ-ment of ex-Service men, have by no means confined their activities to the National Scheme for disabled men, but in many cases have been pressing employers to provide work for the able-bodied by substituting male for female labour, and in other ways. The Committees have been asked to make special arrangements to interview ex-Service men as soon as possible after they first claim out-of-work donation, and this work is being widely carried out. The idea has been put forward from several quarters that special attention should be paid to the question of young fit men who were called to the Colours at too early an age to allow of their entering upon training for skilled occupations, and it has been suggested that the training activities of the Ministry should he extended to these men on the same lines as those followed in the case of apprentices whose training was broken by service in the Forces. It would appear probable, however, that negotiations with the trade unions over such a scheme would prove too difficult to allow of its successful introduction.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.Topics of Discussion.The feature of the papers reviewed this week is that in the discussions on the related questions of Russia, Ireland and Hungary. Ireland has succeeded to Russia as the principal topic. The Prime Minister^ interview with the N.U.R. takes the place occupied last week by Lenin&apos;s letter to British workers. The definite adoption by the joint committee, representing the T.U.C., Labour Party and Co-operative Movement, of a comprehensive scheme of inquiry- into high prices and the cost of living,! has been well received in the more moderate of these papers.* Some allowance must be made for those who, though unemployed, are no longer entitled to donation. They would probably raise the figure to about 200,000. f Cf. this Eeport last week, p. 282.
i &apos; 270Ireland.As was the case with Lenin&apos;s letter, the Prime Ministers interview with the N.U.R. delegation does not receive much direct substantial criticism. These papers were written with one eye on the Labour Party Annual Conference and the other on the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress, which has been called for the 13th July. It is obvious that it has been felt that it would be unwise to adopt too strictly denned an attitude on these matters, in view of the many possible&apos; courses of action that may be adopted.. Suspense and strain are the keynotes of the articles. &quot; Justice &quot; recommends the holding of further &quot; conventions,&quot; one to be calhd by the Prime Minister after the type of-the 1917 Convention, and the other to be a joint meeting of the English T.U.C. and the Irish. Trades Union Congress and Labour Party. The London correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; believes that the Prime Minister is calculating upon the neutrality of British Labour, and &quot; hopes and believes &quot; that the Prime Minister is wrong. This correspondent, has not too great a confidence in the Trades Union Congress. In a leading article the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; misinterprets the Prime Minister and expresses the opinion , that the question now is whether the English people are willing at his bidding &quot; to sacrifice a million lives and to carry on a five years&apos; war to force the Irish people to submit to an. alien rule.&quot; The Prime Minister &quot; has already uselessly sacrificed a million British lives in a five years&apos; war under the pretence of establishing the right of self-determination.&quot;&apos; The &quot; Nation &quot; arrives at a similar conclusion : &quot; We are moving to war for the right to control another people.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; states that the Irish question is assuming, an industrial as well as a political aspect, and prophesies that the continuance of the present policy must, before long, lead to big industrial troubles here as well as in Ireland. The &quot; Railway Review &quot; contains a leading article glorifying the National Union of Railwaymen on account of the Bristol Conference. It. is suggested that the work of the N.U.R. in this matter is not yet completed. &quot; A union that, for the first time in history, can bring into a common conference, and to a common agreement, men of the North and South of Ireland, meeting as workers and not as politicians, is not likely to be exhausted in its first effort of conciliation/&apos; This paper again complains of the conduct of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; towards the N.U.R. in general and the Bristol Conference in particular : &quot; those responsible for the &apos; Daily Herald &apos; report of the Bristol Conference were deliberately and intentionally striving for mischief.&quot;Government Policy. -.......................*....The statistical summary of output and costs of production, proceeds and profits of the coal mining industry as a whole, for the quarter ending the 31st March, 1920, which was published on the 17th June, receives some attention. The most important criticism is contained in an interview by Mr. R. B. Suthers in the &quot; Clarion &quot; with Mr. V. Hartshorn. Mr. Hartshorn does not show too intimate a knowledge of the details of the return, but develops the thesis that the recent increase of 14s. 2d. in the price of domestic coal was made in order that the coalfields, which in the first quarter of the year made losses, might be put each on a paying basis, in preparation for the possible abolition of Government control in two months&apos; time. Mr. Suthers adopts the theory that the miners&apos; policy is to ask for a flat rate increase &quot; so that the richer coalfields may help the poorer.&quot;In the &quot; Labour Pioneer,&quot; Mr. Ben Riley writes an article on the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill. Full details of the Bill are given, and Mr. Riley warns his readers that the percentage increases permitted by the Bill to landlords must be calculated on standard net rent and not on the present gross rent. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; attacks the Poplar Borough Council, over which Mr. George Lansbury presides, for advertising housing bonds. &quot; Our advice is not to put a penny in housing, bonds but to urge our neighbours to demand houses fit to live in for themselves and all their neighbours rent free, as now is the case in Soviet Russia.&quot; In the &quot; Labour Pioneer,&quot; Mr. Tom Myers, M.P., gives a favourable account, except for Clause 2, of the Women,. Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill.The Cost of Living.The &quot;New Statesman&quot; deals with the Labour joint enquiry into high prices and the cost of living. The history of price movements since the armistice is discussed, and the opinion is expressed that the elaborate scheme put forward by the Miners&apos; Federation last December consisted almost entirely of emergency measures which would have had at the most only a fractional, and, in the majority of cases, quite a tem-porary, effect upon prices. &quot; Its realisation of the inadequacy of the methods which were adopted for dealing with the temporary emergencies of war, to meet requirements of the post-war situation, induced the Labour Party and T.U.C. to establish their joint(c 2021) 2M2
committee. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; recommends this committee to adventure beyond the comparatively easy questions of price fixing, Government control and anti-profiteering measures, and to go into the problems of credit, currency, and the banking system. The opinion is expressed that if our Labour statesmen are not equal to these more difficult tasks, they will be wasting their time. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; also approves of the scheme adopted by the committee, and unfavourable reference is made to the resolution of the recent I.L.P. conference on high prices.&quot;5 &quot; This problem will not be solved either by declarations in favour of Socialism or of the unity of the Socialist Trade Union and Co-operative Movements.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; continues to be the sole paper to concentrate entirely upon the question of prices. This week it is suggested that what is needed is a public party representing consumers as such, and that the Labour Party in this respect differs little from the Capitalist Parties.Labour Party Annual Conference.There is little comment this week on this conference, the majority of papers having reserved their comment until they were in a position to review the whole of the proceedings. The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however, stresses the importance of the increase in contributions but suggests that this increase hardly goes far enough. &quot; The whole method of choosing Labour candidates needs to be overhauled, and this means a complete re-organisation of the financial basis, and of the relations between the various affiliated bodies and the Party as a whole.&quot; This paper, too, reaffirms its opinion that some time must elapse before there can be any prospect of forming a really representative and closely knit organisation of Labour on an international basis. On this question of the international relations of Labour, Mr. T. Kennedy, in &quot; Justice,&quot; trusts that no attempt will be made to establish an all inclusive International, out of elements which must be mutually destruc-tive, but insists that the basis of the International to which the Labour Party affiliates must be the principle of democratic political action. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; suggests that the real problem which now confronts Labour is how to make itself effective. In this he is in accord with the feeling of the Scarborough Conference, but it may be judged that this accord ceases when &quot; Rob Roy &quot; goes on to express a belief that a fully efficient Parliamentary Labour Party would give the Labour Movement the effective weapon for which it longs.Part IV. General Topics.General Survey of the Week.With regard to the industrial situation the cessation of the strike of marine wireless operators and the postponement of the threatened strikes of gas workers, members of the Typographical Association, Essex agricultural labourers, and Scottish bank clerks, have made the outlook much more hopeful. The most important event of the week, from the point of view of the future, is the commencement on the 29th June, by the Industrial Court, of the periodical review of wages in the engineering and shipbuilding trades. The question of non-unionism is creating trouble in the weaving sections of the textile trades generally and in the occupations covered by the Electrical Trades Union. The threatened permanent closing down of industrial establishments in reply to strike action is becoming a feature of minor current disputes.From the political point of view the most important event of the week under review has been the holding of the annual conference of the Labour Party. Attention may be drawn to the marked prominence of discussions on foreign and international policy, and to the expressions of confidence by the conference in the official leaders of the Party.The annual delegate meeting of the National Union of Kailwaymeri will open at Belfast on the 5th July, and the annual delegate conference of the M.F.G.B. on the 6th July. The special meeting of the Trades Union Congress to discuss Labour policy towards Polish and Irish munitions will be held on the 13th July.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen policies current at the week ended the 18th June, 1920, was 181,872 (180,801 lodged by men and 1,071 by women). The previous week there were 188,770 policies current, 187,583 lodged by men and 1,187 by women.* Of. this Report the 16th June, p. 271.
65,849 unemployment books (45,027 lodged by males and 20,822 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 18th June, 1920, an increase of 730 since the 11th June. At the latter date 44,919 books were lodged by males and 20,000 by females (a total of 65,119).The total live register at all Employment Exchanges at the week ended the 18th June was 248,773 men, 47,362 women and 20,894 juveniles, compared with 257,402 men, 46,777 women and 20,964 juveniles a week ago (the 11th June) and 270,336 men, 46,560 women and 21,529 juveniles a month ago.Ireland, Russia and Hungary.Except for the resolutions passed by the annual conference of the Labour Party which are dealt with below, there is little further to report with regard to the attitude of the Labour movement on these three questions.The Irish Council of the N.U.R. issued a manifesto on the 23rd inst. endorsing the manifesto of the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party, which asked railwaymen to refrain from precipitate action that might transfer the responsibility for the present position from the Government to the Irish people. As a result of a conference between the Executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress and representatives of Irish railwaymen on the 25th inst. a manifesto was issued on the 26th inst. This mani-festo records the decision of this conference that railwaymen should continue to refuse to carry munitions, that they should refuse to work trains conveying armed soldiers or police, however few or however many, that each man should offer to work his train provided that neither armed troops nor munitions were being carried, and that no man should refuse to work on the sole ground that a colleague had been suspended or dismissed. It is reported that action on these lines has seriously impeded the working of the Irish railways in the South and West.The boycott of Hungary ordered by the International Federation of Trade Unions has had no direct results in this country, but the general hostility of the trade union movement towards the present Hungarian Government continues in full strength and is being extended to the Government of Rumania.Employment Exchanges.The Committee of Inquiry into the working and administration of the Employment Exchanges resumed its sittings on the 28th ult., when it heard evidence submitted by Mr. j. H. Whitley, M.P., and Lord Askwith. On the 29th ult., evidence was given by Mr. H. Wolfe, Assistant Secretary, Industries Department, Ministry of Labour, Prof. M. A. R. Wright, Chairman of the Gateshead and District Local Employment Committee., and Sir James Urquhart, ex-Chairman of the Dundee Employment Committee.Unemployment Insurance Bill.The National Joint Committee of Approved Societies under the Health Insurance Acts which represents the Friendly Societies, met at Westminster on the 25th inst. and resolved that in the event of the Government securing the exclusion of Friendly Societies from the administration of Unemployment Insurance, steps should be taken to induce the House of Lords to disagree with the Commons. The Friendly Societies have added an additional argument to their case ; they point out that should Employment Exchanges be abolished, and Friendly Societies also be excluded from the administration of Unemployment Insurance-every employed person might be compelled to join, a trade union.Inquiry into Unemployment.The committee set up by the National Alliance of Employers and Employed to con-sider the means of providing against unemployment met on the 23rd inst., and adopted a scheme for their inquiry. The causes of unemployment will first be considered and among the aspects of this question to be dealt with are : Fluctuations in trade, introduction of new machinery, sickness, industrial accidents and old age. Mr. A. Pugh, of the Iron and-Steel Trades Confederation, is to be chairman of the committee, and Mr. A. Millar Hagerty,. secretary.The personnel of the committee was given in this report last week, page 283. BuiUing Guilds.It is reported that the Manchester Building Guild has undertaken a small contract for the building of houses under the Housing Acts for the Wilmslow Urban District Council(B 2021)   . ,    . 2 M 3
Cheshire. The Manchester Corporation, however, has refused to accept the tender of the Manchester Building Guild on the ground that the prices quoted were too high, and the Manchester Guild is reported to be contemplating a withdrawal from its agreement with the Irlam Urban District Council or the ground that this Council is taking steps to entrust the building of the balance of the houses under its housing scheme to private contractors.International Seamen&apos;&apos;s Conference.The Genoa International Labour Conference, held under the Labour part of the Peace Treaty, to consider the application to seamen of the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference last year, opened on the 17th June. In view of the semi-diplomatic character of this conference, it is not proposed to give in its report any detailed account of the proceedings on the agenda of the conference, but attention may be drawn to what is considered as the most important event in the first week&apos;s sessions, namely, the unanimous adoption of a resolution at the ninth plenary session on the 21st June with regard to the position of the German delegation and the atti-tude of the German Government towards submarine warfare. The adoption of this resolu-tion has had the effect of securing that the workers&apos; group, including the representatives of the German, French and British delegations, along with many others, should work together in harmony. The resolution includes an important declaration made by Herr Wissell on the authority of his Government deploring the numerous victims caused by submarine warfare and affirming the intention of the German Government to carry out Annex I of Article 244 of the Treaty of Peace.Efforts had been made by the International Labour Office to secure that the German delegation should not include any German seamen&apos;s representatives who had signed the German manifesto of 1916 endorsing intensified submarine warfare, and Mr. Havelock Wilson, who has been appointed chairman of the workers&apos; group at the conference, was under an engagement never to sit with any German seamen who had signed this manifesto. In point of fact one of the technical advisers to the German delegation, Herr Doring, was a signatory of the manifesto. Over and above this, however, difficulties had merged in the workers&apos; group of delegates, and on one occasion the German delegates were not present at a meeting of the group. The result of this was a united protest from the German delega-tion to the conference, and for three days the workers&apos; group, owing to these internal difficulties, did not transact any business. The result of the resolution, however, is that the British and French and other allied delegates have agreed to overlook the presence of Herr Doring, and the workers&apos; group has since worked together harmoniously.This is considered to be an important result, especially in the light of two facts. The first is that at every workers&apos; international conference since the war, friction in greater or less measure has occurred between the German delegates on the one hand, and the allied delegates on the other, and in most cases the attainment of results has been seriously impeded. These difficulties were avoided at the Washington conference only because of the fact that a German delegation was not present. Secondly, it was expected that at the Genoa con-ference, in particular, these difficulties would be very great owing to the fact that, more than any other class of workers, the seamen were affected by the war and nourished senti-ments of enmity towards one another. It. is therefore considered a great achievement on the part of the International Labour Office to have secured the unanimous adoption at this conference of a resolution making possible harmonious international relations between seamen of all countries.Labour Party Annual Conference.The annual conference of the Labour Party opened at Scarborough on the 22nd June and continued until 25th June. Some five important decisions were taken. The conference devoted the greater part of one day to the discussion of diplomatic relations and adopted a resolution condemning the peace treaties and demanding the recognition of the Soviet Government of Russia; the most important clause of the resolution was that the Prime Minister be requested to receive a deputation representing the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. and the Labour Party executive for the purpose of laying before him the report of the Labour Commission of Inquiry into the &quot; White Terror &quot; in Hungary and to put before him the necessity of peace with Russia and of the raising of the blockade. An amendment was moved to this resolution by the British Socialist Party delegates, providing for the summoning of a National Labour Conference in order to organise a general strike in support of the Soviet Government of Russia. This amendment was opposed by Messrs. Smillie, Thomas and Bevin, and was rejected by an overwhelming majority. The main resolution was passed with virtual unanimity.
The relations of the Party towards the various socialist Internationals was the second important topic discussed. A resolution in favour of affiliation to the Third (Moscow) International was defeated on a card vote by 2,715,000 votes and a resolution for secession from the Second International was defeated by 494,000 votes.The third topic was the policy the Labour Party should adopt on the drink question. A resolution in favour of total, prohibition was defeated on a card vote by 2,131,000 votes : nationalisation of the liquor trade was defeated by 320,000 votes and a resolution in favour of local option was carried by 1,380,000 votes.Finally two important decisions were made with regard to the domestic organisation of the Party. The proposal of the executive for increase of affiliation fees from 2d. to 3d. pel member of the constituent bodies per annum was adopted, a resolution was carried urging on all the bodies affiliated to the Party the desirability of making such arrangements as would permit of Parliamentary representatives giving their continuous attention to their duties in the House of Commons. With regard to the whole position of the Parliamentary Party, the conference appeared to arrive at an agreement, though it was nowhere expressed in formal resolutions, along two lines: firstly, that change in the personnel of the Parliamentary Labour Party was not so much the need, as the provision for the Party of an expert technical and clerical staff; secondly, that the new constitution should not be exploited by middle-class political adventurers, but that the Party should proceed upon its previous line of development.A remarkable feature of the proceedings of the conference was the prominence given to problems of foreign and international policy. The questions of housing and milk supply were left for discussion until the last hours of the last day of the conference and the question of mines nationalisation was raised on the last day in an emergency resolution adopted without discussion and proposed by Mr. Smillie mainly as a reply to the Ministry of Mines Bill.N.U.R.The Annual General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen will be held in the Co-operative Hall, Belfast, from 5th to 10th July. The preliminary Agenda which has been issued promises a very wide scope of discussion apart from the two subjects of the award of the National Wages Board and the Executive^ policy on the question of Irish and Polish munition which will come up for decision.The recent national settlement is attacked in many points. The Briton Ferry branch have put forward a resolution for the immediate termination of the recent settlement upon standardisation and the opening up of negotiations for an improved scheme, leaving the basic rate to be determined, &quot; as and when necessity demands.&quot; This branch also proposes the abolition of the sliding scale. The Blyth and Covent Garden branches propose that a demand should be made for an increase of 5s. per day, to be replied to by 26th July at the latest. Another resolution favours the immediate termination of the Advisory Committee agreement which would involve the withdrawal of the N.,U.R. representatives from the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Transport, and the adoption of a policy of nationalisation with joint control.Criticism of the officials of the Union is also a prominent item. The Kirkcaldy branch demands the resignation of Mr. J. H. Thomas on account of the line of conduct adopted by him &quot; before, during, and after the recent national strike.&quot; Briton Ferry and Swansea No. 1 branches desire a rule to be made restraining officials from making public comments on proposed agreements, until the same have been considered by the members and rejected or accepted by the governing bodies.&apos;&apos; These branches will also ask the meeting to condemn the action of the Executive in lending official; support to the London Electric Railways (Fares, &amp;c.) Bill. The reverberation of the Transport Workers&apos; Court of Enquiry is heard in a demand from five branches for a public court of enquiry into the railway industry, Crewe No. 2 Branch adding, &quot; with the object of establishing for all railwaymen a minimum rate of 16s. a day.&quot; The recent report of the unofficial National Conference of the District Councils of the N.U.R. will be discussed on a motion from Wolverhampton for the complete reorganisation of the Union on the basis of six grades : (1) Traffic, (2) locomotive, (3) goods, (4) shopmen, (5) engineering, and (6) supervisory and clerical. The wide variety of mis-cellaneous motions may be indicated by the fact that one demands a revision of the attitude of the Executive towards the Central Labour College and Scottish Labour College, another deals with working arrangements with the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and a third makes definite suggestions for investments in the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;
It is worth notice that at a special meeting of the London District Council held on&apos; the 22hd June to consider this agenda, acceptance of the National Wages Board Award was recommended, the proposal to abolish the sliding scale was rejected, it was agreed to support the suggested rule for restraining officials from making public statements during^ the course of negotiations, the demand for a public inquiry into the railway industry, and the resolution to terminate the Advisory Committee agreement and adopt a policy of nationalisation were endorsed. The claim for an all-round increase of 5s. was not supported.It is reported that the N.U.R. is considering proposals as to its Parliamentary and electoral activities which provide that in a constituency where an official candidate has been adopted with the sanction of the union executive, a fixed grant of  250 per annum will be made to the local Labour Party subject to satisfactory local organisation, the grant to be increased to  300 in cases where the electorate exceeds 60,000. Candidates on election will be granted a maintenance allowance of  250 per annum, third-class railway fare, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. When visiting the constituency during the Parliamentary vacations, members will be required to place their services at the disposaL of the union.The Annual Report of the Union shows an increase in membership of 64,530. There is a total favourable balance of  1,188,853 an increase of  10,267 on last year. The protec-tion fund showed a credit balance on 31st December of  131,856, despite the payment of over  250,000 in strike pay for the strike last September.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.The report that members of the executive of the M.F.G.B., meeting at Scarborough. in connection with the Labour Party Annual Conference virtually decided upon the pro-posals to be put before their annual delegate conference at Leamington on the 6th July is confirmed by a speech of Mr. Hodges at Royston, near Barnsley, on the 24th July. Mr. Hodges declared that they were now going to ask for a further advance, and would also argue that the profits of the industry justified a reduction in the price of coal to &quot; ordinary consumers.&quot;The annual delegate conference of the Federation at Leamington on the 6th July, in addition to its decisions upon matters of national wage policy, will discuss many matters of internal importance. Resolutions appear on the agenda dealing with the power of the M.F.G.B. to call a national strike, with working hours, with annual holidays, with the relation of the Federation to the Central Labour College. There is little doubt but that the Conference will confirm the position taken up by the Parliamentary leaders of the miners-in the House of Commons on the 30th June, with regard to the Ministry of Mines Bill.There is nothing further to report with regard to the continued affiliation of the S.W.M.F. to the M.F.B.G.General Federation of Trade Unions.The annual report, of the General Federation of Trade Unions for the year ending, the 31st March, 1920, has been published. Although there is a decrease of -7 in the number of affiliated societies, owing partly to trade union amalgamations, the total individual, membership of affiliated bodies as compared in last year&apos;s Report has increased by 265,001. The actual net membership in which contribution have been paid shows.an increase this year of 245,342. The reserve fund is beginning to show the effects of the post-war industrial, situation. Owing to the absence of disputes during the war, the reserve fund had reached in March, 1919, the unprecedented height of  254,266 9s. Id. The demands of the past year, however, have depleted the fund by  133,872 16s. lOd. that is more than one-half  and reduced it to a level already surpassed in 1916. For this, the prolonged ironfounders&apos; strike and the cotton weavers&apos; strike of last year are chiefly responsible.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation.It is reported that the executive of this Federation are taking steps to carry out the policy endorsed by the annual general meeting of the Council of the Federation at
-Southampton on the 3rd and 4th June, with reference to the amalgamation of kindred unions within the Federation^ It is stated that discussions are now in progress for the -dividing of the Dock, Wharf, Eiverside and General Workers&apos; Union, and for a fusion of the transport sections of this union with the National Union of Dock Labourers and the ^Scottish Union of Dock Labourers.T.
