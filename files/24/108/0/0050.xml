Copy No.    / jC.P.-1548. CABINET.IREIAND. &quot;Note by Mrft Lcp  covering a letter from Lord Qraniiore&quot;and Browne.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached letter which I have received from Lsrd Oranmore and Browne.    *?i,th regard to his statement that no compensation can be claimed in the case of abandoned Folice Barracks subsequently destroyed by Sinn Peinors, I am informed by the Chief Secretary that this is not the case and any such claim for compensation is covered by the existing law.   further a Criminal Injuries Bill is already in draft which, when passed, will enable compensation to be paid to any person whose property has been destroyed.(Intd.) W.H.L.30th June, 1920,
12, Cavendish. Place, 28th June, 1920.My dear Long,I am very glad that you were able to assure me, to-day,  . that it is the intention of the Government to provide that comit&apos;pensation for malicious injuries shall be payable out of Local Government Grants, in cases where the Local Authority refuse to levy the amount awarded.Many persons, in Ireland, hold that where Police Barracks have been abandoned by the Authorities, and subsequently destroyed by Sinn peiners, no claim for malicious injury can arise,These buildings/ as a rule, have been let to one R.I.C. at a very low rent on the understanding that they will be occupied and used for the purpose of R,I,C. Barracks.If for strategic reasons, the Government decide to abandon them and leave them.dsrelict; theirs is the responsi-bility, and it does not seem fair that the ratepayers should be called upon to payoinIt is commonly reported/ many parts of Ireland that it is the intention of Sinn peiners shortly to inaugurate a campaign of burning country houses in order that they may   -be relieved from the necessity of adding their value to the compensation which they propose to offer to landlords, when, under an Irish Republic, they compulsorily acquire their demesnes, and I think it is more than likely that this plan will shortly be put into operation.   It was my intention, as usual, to go over to Ireland, at the end of next month, for the autumn; but I am very doubtful whether, in the present condition of the country, I shall be justified in exposing my wife and family to the risks of certain anxiety and proba-hie danger.Only the other day, a parlourmaid of a n.ei,$ibour of mine, General i,ewin, was- ordered, &quot;by the Sinn peiners- to leave
1MJ   /&quot;k^Ijs ^employment-.   She did not obey, and when bicycling home from Tuara, the neighbouring town, she.was ambushed by six men, who divested her of every stAch of clothing, and forced her to bicycle back.to her Employe r* 9. house-stark naked.Yours very sincerely, &apos;(Sgd.)   ORA^toKS.The Right Hon.Walter Long, k.V.2, Whitehall Gardens, 30th June, 192q.
