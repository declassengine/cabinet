I 4 I!&apos;See C.,P.1115*   The object of the Bill is to secure amendments in themachinery provided by the Milk and Diarie3 (Consolidation). Act of 1915 for securing improvements in the quality of the milk supply.The principal Act and the amending Bill - which apply tc England and Wales, but not to Scotland or Ireland - are measures designed in the interests of public health for the benefit of consumers and not for the benefit of the pro-ducers of milk.Under the principal Act provision was made for the issue of Or&amp;ars by the Ministry of Health for the registration ofdairymen and dairies (Section l), and the inspection of cattle in diaries, of dairios etc,etc*Power of enforcing such Orders is given to LocalAuthorities (Section 2)t and provision is made for the expenses of -^ocal Authorities to be defrayed, out of local rates (Section 17).lo provision was made in the principal Act for a charge to be made to dairymen or to owners of dairies for regis-tration, nor was any provision made in the draft Amending j Bill for a charge for the issue of licences * vIfo-der the Amending Bill a system of licensing is sub-stituted for registration and it, is estimated that the cost of inspection and administration of the licensing system etc. will amount to an annual expenditure of  500,000 -  750,000 or possibly more, and it was decided &apos;1 hurriedly before the Amending Bill was introduced onI 10th May to take power to charge fees for licensing dairy-men and dairies (Clause l). I ,The Treasury, in a letter (21st May, 1-920) to theI Ministry of Health, state that &quot;they do not think that itwould be imposing an&quot;unfair burden upon the milk trade to require the whole cost of/
the licensing system to be met from fees.&quot;   They urge the framing of a scale&apos;of&apos; fees on this basis, or alternatively, the imposition of a flat rate fee of not less than  2 a farm; If this is done they would agree to half of any deficit incarr^ ed by Local Authorities being defrayed out of an Exchequer Grant.This is, I understand, the present position, and having fully considered it, I regret that I am not able, as Minister of Agriculture, to agree to the proposed charge to farmers of fees for licences.     My reasons for objection are briefly as follows(l)   The Kilk and Dairies Bill and the principal Act are public health measures designed to benefit the consumer and&apos; not the producer, and the latter will, -therefore, strongly resent bearing the cost of an interference with his business which is for the/public and not for his or&apos;rn benefit.   As it is, dairy farmers ^ill be put to considerable expense in some cases to qualify for a licence,-(2)   Dairy farmers, and agriculturists generally,. will strongly oppose payment of the proposed fee on principle-. They will feel that, under the (Bill, they will not merely have to submit to a system of inspection which they dislike-, . but that they will have to pay for it.   They will, moreover, regard it as a dangerous precedent and -be apprehensive of its extension to the sale of cattle,  corn and other articles of food which they produce.(3)   Henbers of agricultural constituencies will most certainly be urged by their constituents to oppose the Bill if fees are charged, and the difficulty of getting the Bill &apos; through the House will be considerably increased.(4)   Inasmuch as the Amending Bill does not affect Scotland or Ireland, the anomalous and altogether undesirable.
position... will bo erontod&apos; of&quot;milk.. pro^oer^ijnriilngLand,and ^alos being required to pay fees, whereas those in Scotland&apos;., and Ireland will&apos;be exempt.I am fully alive to the desirability of improving the cleanliness of the milk supply, but I would point ont that we had evidence last winter of the disinclination of the consumer to pay a price for milk that covered cost of production.   The cost of labour has increased since then, and if additional charges have to.be borne or if there is too much interference with his business, many a farmer may give up milk production, and a reduction in milk supply and an increase in price will result.&quot;In the circumstances, I hope it will bo agreed that a foe cannot in equity be charged to a dairy farmer for the inspection of his business by a Government Department&apos; *   Pending a decision of this matter, the Second Reading of the llilk and Dairies Bill should be deferred,*(Signed)   L   of ministry of Agriculture,
