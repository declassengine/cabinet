From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2oth June 1920.(Received 26th, 8 p.m.)] 783 S. Following telegram from Dobbs, No. 79 S., dated 24th June, is repeated &quot;for information :    .,&quot;I announced to Afghan delegates to-day-&apos;bur&apos;intentions regarding Mahsud country and explained circumstances, which have driven us to take &quot;measures contemplated. Announcement evidently came as considerable shock to Afghans.and much, depressed them, but it does not seem likely that they will make much protest while in India, and they are impatiently awaiting detailed statement of benefits which we are prepared to offer.&quot;
