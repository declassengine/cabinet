(P 483$) From Viceroy, Foreign Department, &apos;\Mli June 1920.(Received 20th, 8 a.m.)Clear the line.I-     759 S.   Long telegram, No. 74 S., dated 15th June, received from Dobbs: -&apos; &quot;Afghan delegates have in the last few days sent me numerous informal messages begging me to represent to Government of India serious disadvantages, attendant on present limited scope of our discussions. They say that after prolonged absence of delegation from their country Afghan people will be frankly bewildered if delegates return with nothing but vague assurances of contingent and conditional advantages to be obtained from British friendship, and without any definite proposal for considera--tion of both Governments. Mahmud- Tarsi warns me, 1 believe with perfect truth, that he has.himself lost heavily in influence at Kabul through the delay and doubts as to whether anything tangible will be obtained by him, and he fears that, if he now returns..empty-handed, he will be dismissed and his personal conviction of importance of British friendship will be useless; Afghans have, he urges, shown themselves quiet on frontier during the past few weeks except for some very minor incidents. Their attitude has undergone considerable change and they are disenchanted with Bolsheviks and anxious for British friendship. They are resigned to Turkish peace terms and to fact that we are not going to make them any frontier concessions. But some new frontier incidents or excitement in India or elsewhere in Asia may, he says, change all this while our relations are in present unstable condition, and he says we should strike while iron is hot and anchor Afghanistan to our side by defining&quot; now in explicit terms what we expect from Afghanistan and what we are prepared to do for Afghanistan;&quot; he would return to Kabul with these definite proposals and Afghan Government could then decide at once on its future policy. I (corrupt. group) represent that there is sound sense in Tarsi&apos;s argument. Six months have, now passed since first proposals for this conference were-put forward. Jts primary objects of Staving oft&quot; hostilities, during worst part of hot weather, of parrying effects of Khilafat agitation on Afghan minds, and of thoroughly discussing misunderstandings&apos;have been attained, and attitude certainly of Afghan delegates and, so far as can be^ascertained, of Afghan Government, has been much softened and modified. If no definite offer can now be made of what we are prepared to do for Afghanistan, including definite statement regarding subsidy, there will, I fear, be grave risk/of our drifting apart again, or, if our negotiations with Bolsheviks are unsuccessful, of Bolshevik promises winning over Afghans, who will believe that we have been playing with them ; moreover, if we make definite arrangement with Afghans now, both Indian Khilafat agitators and-rebel elements, among frontier tribes will think they have been finally deserted by Afghans and will probably abandon expectancy (? of help from them) against us. ,1 earnestly beg that policy of conference may be reconsidered in the light of foregoing remarks. Interruption of conference owing to Id festivities may perhaps enable Government of India, if they concur in my views, to make representations to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfin time for fresh orders to be given before our discussions end.&quot;In addition to these arguments we have new facts that Suritz has&apos; now been, definitely authorised to make offer of money, arms and material to Afghanistan, and that recent serious conspiracy in Kabul which was caused by lack of funds sufficient to pay troops and officials shows Amir&apos;s desperate need of ready money. Dobbs believes that if we are prepared now to state definitely to Afghans what help we arc ready to give, they will on their side undertake to refrain from intrigues with our&apos; frontier tribes, to prevent Kabul being used as centre of activity by Indian revolu-tionaries, and block passage of Bolshevik propaganda to India. If the adoption of-this policy is disallowed, there seems every probability that Amir may be forced into Bolsheviks&apos;, arms in order, to secure cash without delay. Situation has largely changed since the receipt of your telegram of 4th May. Afghans are in much more submissive mood, and definite offer of help could no longer be interpreted as yielding to truculence or submitting, to blackmail. We think in changed circumstances it would be unwise to insist on further period of probation, and that we should .be authorised to make a clear statement of what we are prepared to give Afghans in the shape of subsidy in return for action which we require of them. There will of course be no question of any immediate new agreement. Afghan delegates would return to Kabul and explain our terms to Amir. We trust that you may be able to let us have very early orders on this suggestion.
