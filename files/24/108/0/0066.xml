Important conferences of the Miners and the Railwayman will be held next week.   It is rumoured, that the Executive of the latter will oppose any motion for a fresh national demand; if this is true, there will be discord within the Union.   The Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation is believed to intend to recommend a claim for an increase of wages of .2s. a day for men and la. a day for boys and a reduction of 14s. 2d. in the cost of domestic coal.The engineers have already presented their claim to an advance of 6d. an hour to the Industrial Court.   Their increases awarded -since 1914 vary from 112$ to 180.1 on pre-war rates and in the case of the ship-builders from 107$ to 178$.The spectre of unemployment is beginning to haunt the minds of all workers; already there is unemployment in Lancashire and in the Midland boot factories.The prospectus of the new Communist Party is given.   It is a document that would procure for its authors heavy sentences of imprisonment in nearly every other country.
t-    215THS OOMMPBIST PARTYThe newly-formed Communist Party has drawn up a programme of 57 articles, which are of importanoe in that they constitute the most complete declaration of Bolshevism yet made by any band of extremists in this country.   It must &quot;be remembered, however, that the party is ridiculously small; nevertheless, it is vory active in propaganda* and in times of unemployment or scarcity it is lively to grow.   In almost every country except iftigland the circulation of such a document would lead to criminal proceedings and substantial penalties.The first twenty articles cover the objects of the Party, which include the establishment of Communism on a ,basis of Soviets for workers, soldiers, sailors, mothers and the professions, the introduction of communal housekeeping, the socialisation and free use of houses, transport, post and telegraph1communication, and universal free education until the -age of so.Articles 21&apos;to 34 deal with the International federation of Communism,-which is declared to entail the destruction of all empires and the liberation of subject &apos; nationalities, but &quot;the Red Army of Communism will march across national frontiers at the call of the Communist workers of any nation,&quot;Article 25 proclaims the necessity for &quot;the disestablishment and disendowment 6f all Churches and religious institutions/  Bo schools or institutions for secular education shell bo run in connection with religious bodies.^ -    - ;:The remaining articles detail the methods and organisation by which the ctato of Communism will be reached.   The present system of legal administration is to be swept away, as &quot;crime has its origin in economicneed/
need and the evils and conventions of capitalist-society&quot;&apos; nevertheless, Communist judges (men and women) are to be elected by the Soviets; except in the case of &quot;dangerous counter-revolutionary crime&quot; there will toe no capital punishment.national and individual finance is the subject of four articles which decree: the abolition of private banking, insurance societies and money-lending institutions; the seizure, without compensation, of all private wealth. Landlords and capitalists are to be offered work or maintenance on the same level as the rest of the community.Articles 41 and 42 bear quotation:41.   &quot;The Communist Republic will not hesitate to suppress oounter-revolutionary newspapers and propaganda.&quot;42.   &quot;The Army, flavy and Police Force created under capitalism and all who belong to the ranks of the black army of capitalism, shall be disarmed. . A workers&apos; Red Army and Navy shall be created. All trusted workers who haTe had military training shall be armed, and all workers shall be trained to fight if necesmrv in defence of the Workers&apos; Revolution^&quot;The Communist Party believes that the revolution willbe accomplished by industrial mass action, sabotage and thegeneral strike, leading to armed insurrection, and will therefore:*(a) &quot;Organise to seize control of production;&quot;(b) &quot;Carry on propaganda In the Army and Wavy towean the workers from their allegiance to the Capitalist State ...&quot;(o)   &quot;Urge the workers to boycott the police force.&quot;The substitution of rank and file organisation for Trade Unionism and the socialisation of the Co-operative Societies are advocated.  Parliament and the local government bodies are declared to be &quot;instruments of the capitalist system&quot;, while the members of tke Labour Party are described as &quot;opportunist reformists and social patriots and tradev union/
union bureaucrats who have already allied themselves with Capitalism, against the Workers&apos; Revolution at home and abroad.&quot; . -Finally the Communist Party proclaims its belief that;v     &quot;THE OPPORTUNISTS&apos; AND CHAUVINISTS, FAITHFULSERVANTS OF THE BOURGEOISIE, ARE THE DIRECT ENEMIESOF THE PROLETARIAT&quot;   and that&quot;THE SOLE LEADER IN THE FIGHT OF THE PROLETARIATFOR FREEDOM IS THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL!,.&quot; :This document is, in the main, the work of the &quot;ergatocracists&quot; Eden and Cedar Paul.The names of the Provisional Organising Council of the Communist Party serve as a useful indication of the extent to which Social Soviets have been formed in thiscountry.   They are:-Cedar Paul .. Eden Paul T. Kime Mr. Bishop W. Paradise Wm. Leslie .. Mrs&apos;. Walker .. ;,VJ, -Sullivan .. A. Hawke .. &apos;/ S. Sylvia Pankhurst N.L. Smyth ..&apos; . , Mrs. Cole .. R.

Wales Oxford  -   &apos; Sheffield Ashtcn-under-Lyne CheshireGorton&apos;, Manchester Gorton, Manchester NorfolkMiss Pankhurstrs action in forming the Communist Party has aroused a storm of resentment-in;the camps of the other extremists and Arthur Maciiaanus and Albert Inkpin, who are respectively chairmen and secretary of what istermed/
termed tho &quot;Joint Provisional Committee for the Communist Party&quot;, call it &quot;sabotage&quot;.   Apart from tho antipathy of her ez-colleagues, Miss Pankhurst has been latterly faced with the antagonism of London gatherings; on June 23rd a crowd of young people smashed the windows of her meeting room at Willesden and she herself was hooted.Corrio, who was recently almost without money, has managed to collect enough to pay accounts for the Agenda Press totalling  157.   It is probable that he has received! assistance from Rothstein.the SCARBOROUGH conference the tangible result of the labour Party Conference, * recorded in the votes on important questions, is somewhat surprising. The defeat of extremist resolutions may in all probability be attributed to the firm attitude of the trade Union leaders, who are confronted with increasing internal trouble engineered by revolutionaries, and fear the loss of their positions, and to the able Chairmanship of Mr. Hutchinson, who dealt very firmly with disorderly elements,  netherfactor was undoubtedly the timely circulation of Lenin&apos;s letter, which was bound to disilluei many half-hearted converts Who had dallied with Bolshevism Some use was made of the fact that the &quot;Herald&quot; would not print lenin&apos;s letter in full until it was paid for as an advertisement.Tie votes on the more important resolutions were:Affiliation with the Third international&apos;Secession from the Second InternationalAgainst 2,940,000 $or       ,    225,000Against 1,010,000 for 516^000Amendment/

Jswett, Vice-Chairman.The extremists are incensed by the Voting at theConference and are violently attacking the Trade union leaders.UMvgLQYMBUT JU^D,TRADE Di&amp;KSSSIOirAs has always been tho case in times of trade depression, unemployment, both actual and prospective, is a useful weapon for labour agitators.   In the shipbuilding and engineering trades, leaders such as John Hill and Tom Mann have for some Use laid stress on   ie danger of over-production and the boot and shoe trade is in the same case.   It is now reported that in Aocrington, 31ackburn, Bolton, Preston and Oldham large numbers of looms have been stopped and rumours of short time are ourrent.My correspondent writes that the situation in regard to unemployment in Leicester is giving rise to considerable alarm.   Large numbers of workers in the boot and shoe industry are without employment, iE many Instances for aweek/
week at a time.  Hosiery workers are- also- much leeer certain, of regular work than they were a few months ago.   This slump in trade has seriously affeoted Leicester and the number of unemployed is growing daily.   Tho moot optimistic people there fear that very hard times are ahead.It would seem, therefore, that the present is an opportune moment to expose the extremist doctrine that if less work be done by each man, more men oan be employed.THE V.C OAHDBN PAREYThe Garden Party given by His Majesty on June 26th ] and the elimination of the precedence of rank has made an excellent impression on labour, even the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; publishing an appreciative account.An extremist at Lewisham who endeavoured to be sarcastic about the Garden Party was taken to task by his audience, who cheered the King \and the Union Jack and refused to let the meeting continue.TEE RAILWAYMEI1On June 23rd a special meeting of the London District Council resolved by 25votes to 4 to accept the award of the National Wages Board and rejected a demand for the abolition of the sliding scale by 35    votes to 10.It is reported that at the Belfast Conference the Executive Committee will *make a firm stand on the question of further demands, which they consider would discredit the action of the Union offioials on, the National Wages Board. It is also said that the Executive will raise the question of Ireland and will advocate support of Home Rule within the ampire but not of a Republio.During 1919 the membership of the National Union of Railwaysen increased from 416,531 to 481,061 and the branches/
-branches-from 1240-to, 1358.   The year&apos;s income was  540,579, ^increase on 1918 of   184,753.   The expenditi increased, however, from  159,874 in 1918 to  530,111 in 1919.   The .cost of the September strike is officially estimated to be over  250,000.   The entire balance of the Union was  1,188,053 as compared with  1,178,586 for the previous year.THE &quot;BANDS Off RUSSIA&quot; I3DVBH3HTThe despondency felt by the organisers of the GrosvewSquare meetings was well put, perhaps inadvertently, byH. Bease on June 23rd, when he said:111 believe the British people will not at the moment indulge in any violent methods,   I do not think that at the present moment you can get any pressure-whatever from the people of this country ... while the. population has increased, there are more fools than ever.   As a matter of fact the ordinary Englishman is more concerned with Capt. Coe&apos;s finals, than with the massacre of the Indians at Amritsar*M*In spite of decreasing attendance, the extremists are advertising another &quot;monster&quot; demonstration for Sunday next.&quot;The Call&quot; publishes wireless messages from its delegates in Russian, UcLaino and Quelch.   From these it is obvious that they have been duped by the iolsheviks. They are evidently much impressed by the fact that they be a special train from the frontier and their &quot;car&quot; plays a prominent part in the riarrativb.   They appear to spool: on every possible occasion, usually in the Company of French and Italian extremists; the intorpretor is invariably Balahanoff, whose rendering of the British speeches is always &quot;cheered to the echo&quot; by audiences numbering thouselTHE HOUSING QUESTIONIt is reported that sanction has so :far been obtained for fifty-one building schemes which involve the employment
-9 -   &apos; - . 249of direct labour.   The largest le that of the Birmingham Corporation, which covers the erection of 500 houses.Xt ie reported that the Building Guild Committee has agreed.with the Ministry of Health %o accept a lump sum of  40 for each house and that an additional charge of 6$ on the prime coot of the house will be made to cover overhead charges.   It is estimated that the Guild will lose slightly on houses costing more than  1,000.   The Co-operative Wholesale Society is to be admitted as a third party in order to facilitate the supply of raw materials.The Marlborough Town Council has decided to adopt direct labour for its housing scheme, under which eighty houses are to be built.Propaganda against increased rent is still being actively conducted and it ie now stated that the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which meets on July 10th, will fix the date of the one day strike in Scotland.   On June 27th about 5,000.people attended a no-rent demonstration in Glasgow which v&amp;s addressed by John McLean and others, and: my correspondent states that the growth and strength of feeling on this question is extraordinary.   The movement is well supported by people whom he describes as the &quot;respectable, sane middle class&quot;.My correspondent sends the following report regarding,      the Ilancheeter house-seizing campaign&quot;Much interest is being taken, by the Mianchester public in the action against Councillors Hart and Hales, over their house-seizing campaign.   Owing to the great hardship caused by the scarcity of houses in Ifenchester, th&amp;se Councillors have had plonty of sympathy shown them by the public in their efforts on behalf of ex-Soldiers and whatever may be the outcome of the proceedings, I am firmly convinced that any attempt to evict these men will le&amp;d to trouble, as the Councillors and their sympathisers are determined to resist all such attempts by force if need be.&quot;THE CO-OPERATIVES 3PVBM3BT AKP THS TRAPS UNIONSThe efforts to effect closer working arrangements between/

There is little fear that the Federation will adopt an extremist policy as long as Hr. Appletpn retains the&apos;     . *   leadership/
leadership, hut its importance is overshadowed &quot;by that of the Trades Union Congress.DAVID RAMSAYDavid Ramsay, who was careful in his speeches , after his release from prison, is now much more violent.On June 26th in Grosvenor Square, he said:   &quot;You must bo the first to take the rifles that are offered to you, and make sure that those rifles point in the right direction.&quot;SINK 1*3Iff Ig GR2AT BRITAINThe antipathy between British Labour and Sinn Fein ie becoming increasingly marked.   An instance has just occurred at Hemsworth, South Blmsall and Eingsley, where the two factions have come to blows in consequence of a recent meeting which was addressed by lire. Sheehy Skeffington.   Some thirty Irish building workers have been forced to leave the district.Particularly violent speeches were made at a &quot;Hands off Russia and Ireland&quot; demonstration at Liverpool on June 23rd.   The speakers were Charles Barker, Secretary of the local Independent Labour Party; J.R. Wilson, Australian deportee; J. Uorton, Communist Party, and the Rev, J. Vint Laughland, who at the end of 1919 was forced tp give up his church in consequence of hiB connection with extremists. The meeting was held in a Chapel and all the speakers advocated direot action and revolution. f  ,John Maclean, whose mind ie unhinged, has now set on foot a new movement called the &quot;Tramps1 Trust&quot;, shich is to assist the Sinn Feiners by overy means in its power; it is preaching a gosuel of hatred agtinst Protestants as well asagainst/
against the Government and it is likely to promote much discord in the Irish colony.Conflicts between the two factions of Irishmen are on the increase, and another of the weekly Saturday nighijErish brawls took place at Greenoek on 26th June. Two policemen and several civilians were severely injured by stones and bottles, and 13 persons, mostly young Irishmen, were arrested.   A peculiar innovation occurred in this fight, the rival factions having chalked notices on walls inviting their respective supporters to gather in the principal thoroughfare to take pert in the affair.IRELANDThe situation in the oountry is steadily growing worse and Sinn Fein is becoming more daring.   Communication is becoming more restricted owing to the refusal of the Hallway Officials to drive trains containing military police and munitions.It is believed that the extreme section contemplate some action soon and that Volunteers in the Dublin area have been warned to be in readiness.    The rebels are considering a plan to dislocate the postal service.A total of 173 outrages was reported during the week; of these 19 were agrarian and 28 were cases of serious crime; 126 are considered to be directly attributable to Sinn Fein and nearly half consisted of attacks on, or attempts to intimidate or injure, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary or their families.   This state of affairs is having a serious effect on the Force.   In addition to the burning of vacated police barracks and Court-houses, there were three othe,r oases of arson.  &apos;Rioting of a party.neturo continued during the week in/
in Londonderry; over a dozen persons wore killed and an unloiown number injured.   Matters are comparatively quiet now.In connection with the railway troublo it should be noted that the railway employees are being intimidated, as is shown by the Kidnapping and court-martiallin;-, by the Irish Volunteers, of the engine driver and guard at Blarney.The Irish Labour leaders find the situation very difficult.   They have decided to fi(.*ht Sinn ?ein!s battle hoping that British Labour would assist; the British labour Party have, however, clearly shown that little aid can be looked for from thorn, and in consequence of this and of preparations made by the Government, a general strike doos not appear at the moment to be desirable, from the point of view of Labour.Although there are wild rumours of a rebellion in the near future, too much attention should not be given to these reports, as the most reliable information goes to show that the Sinn Fein leadors have no plans at the moment for an actual rebellion.   In fact they are dismayed by the continuous arrival of troops and are puzzled how to counteract their use.
