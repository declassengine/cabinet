July 2nd, 1920.THIS-DOCUMENT IS,THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNICJIAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .SECRET. &apos; CABINET,.. s Copy No. &apos; \ ,____CP. 1562. LAND SETTLEMENT POLICY.Memorandum, fry. the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. after careful consideration of the decisions recorded in the Minutes of the Cabinet Meeting on June 24th, I submit herewith paragraphs of a Circular setting out these decisions, which I propose to send to County Councils and County Boroughs for their guidance in administering the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act.     The Circular will be completed by the addition of detailed instructions as to methods for ensuring economies.It is urgent that the Circular be issued forthv/ith, as * until the future policy is settled I am unable to sanction many important schemes submitted by Councils;   Land Settlement is being held up in consequence, and the Councils are without guidance as to the type of scheme which tan be sanctioned.L of F.
i    239DRAFT INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNTY COUNCIL StThe&quot; Statistical Position.&apos;The latest returns reveal the following figures for England and Wales.(a) 198,751 acres have been acquired since January 1st, 1919, of which 105,305 have been let to 7,133 applicants.(b) The balance, viz. 93,446 acres, should provide holdings for about 6,400 of the 13,176 applicants already approved but not yet satisfied.(c) There will then remain 6,776 approved applicants, and a proportion of the applicants not yet interviewed, for whom it may be estimated thata further 170,000 acres will probably be needed.(d) In addition, new ex-service applicants are coming forward, at the rate of about 1,500 a month.   The names of these latter should be entered on a separate list and they should be informed that they cannot be dealt with under the present scheme, dr until the needs of the approved applicants have been met.Difficulties of Equipment.Since January 1919, when County Councils were authorised to recommence the acquisition of. land for small holdings, and especially since the passing of the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act in August 1919, Councils have been encouraged to acquire and equip land in large blocks, rather than in small scattered holdings, in order to facilitate closer settlement and the&quot; co-operative organisation of the new ex-service small holders.   This policy with its consequent provision of a large number of new cottages and farm buildingB, represented a progressive development from the earlier practioe of Councils, which leaned tov/ards the acquisition of bare land near the homes of applicants, or of small equipped farms which could be divided and occupied after adaptation of the existing buildings and a comparatively small amount of new work.
The Ministry still favours this policy in principle, but the present disorganised condition of the building trade, which has brought.the cost, of equipping. holdings to an altogether unreasonable level, coupled with the prolonged delays consequent on the shortage of building labour, makes it imperative, for the time being at any rate, to reconsider the position and to resume the pre-war practice.I en, therefore, to request your Council to make a survey of your County, in the light of the local distribution of the approved applicants to whom no land has yet bean allocated, and to submit proposals for acquiring only such land as will require the minimum expenditure on cottages and farm buildings, or can be let without, equipment.Review of Existing Schemes. You are further desired to review the proposals of lay-out and equipment for the schemes already sanctioned, and for the properties in respect of which schemes have not yet been submitted in detail.   The provisional estimates for equipment prepared at the time the properties were acquired-have already been vitiated by the great and unforeseen rise in building costs, and some reduction of the original equipment will therefore be needed in most cases.Finance.In this connection it ie necessary to emphasise the serious effect of the abnormal conditions in the building trade upon the whole financial position of Land Settlement. The total funds which have been provided by Parliament for LandSettlement in England and Wales amount to  17,250,000, of which  1,250,000 has been allotted to the Ministry&apos;s Farm settlements.&apos;.::V...&quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos;The balance available for loans to County Councils in England and Wales is therefore  16,000,000.   It was always necessary,
in the interests of national economy, that this amount should he expended with the utmost care in order that it might provide for the settlement of the maximum number of ex-service men.   Now it has become clear that, at the present rate of expenditure on land, building and equipment, the unexpended balance will be inadequate to satisfy the requirements of the remaining approved applicants.   I am, therefore, to urge your Council to have recourse, to the utmost extent possible, to the leasing of land, or, failing leasing, to purchase for county annuities for which the Act-of 1919 provided new facilities. Before the war, thirty per cent, of the land was acquired by means of leasing.   Since 1919, the proportion has dropped to onlf ten per cent.   This is unsatisfactory and it is necessary, if the pledge given to ex-Service men is to be fulfilled, that not less than half the future acquisitions shall be by leasing or purchase for annuities.   In order to guide County Councils, and to encourage them to. exercise the utmost economy in acquiring and equipping the necessary land, the Minister will shortly notify to each Council, the proportionate qujota of the funds available up to which he can authorise them to incur capital expenditure.   This limit can only be exceeded by such Councils as may raise the necessary loans locally, instead of through the Public Works Loan Board.Sale of Holdings. The Minister&apos;s attention has been drawn to the readiness expressed by applicants in some districts to take up bare land and to provide their own equipment.   In order to facilitate this, every encouragement should be given to applicants who may be ready to purchase rather than to rent holdings, provided that the value of the remainder of the property is not impaired by the severance.   A leaflet reminding settlers of their statutory rights in this respect vail shortly be issued-
Size, of.HrJjlngB etc, Care must &quot;be taken that applicants are not provided with unnecessarily large holdings.    The average size of pre-war holdings was only thirteen acres.    This has increased to fifteen acres in the schemes submitted during the last eighteen months, and I en to urge that your CounoilTs proposals for dividing estates shall be reconsidered with a view to checking this increase so far as practicable.Jfocclusiye claim of ex-Service men.I am also to repeat, and to lay special stress on, the notification already made that no new holdings are, for the present, to be created for civilian applicants, and -to add that any pre-war holding which may become vacant- *should be re-let only to an ex-Service man.The Cabinet has also directed that the rota of approved applicants should be reconsidered with a view to giving a special preference to men who served overseas during the War as against men who served only at hone.
