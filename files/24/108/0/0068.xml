JJllPi!5!IS !3;l.!?..^ie Property ofCAB I MET * IMPjgR IAL EXCHANGE AKD. CURRENCY.Memorandum by the. Proaident of tho Board of Trade,3*Tho indirect question raised by tho discussion set On by Sir L, V/orthington Evans seems to me to be the most is the question of tho policy of the Government to the early or late restoration of the pound I am dismayed at the thought of a twenty,yearsf,footvital, that with regard sterlingoor even of a ton years1 delay.    Should it be generally supposed that there is to be long delay before the gold basis is again reached, British credit would undoubtedly bo adversely affeoted all the world over, and the effect on our foreign exchanges and the financial standing of London might be serious.    The comparatively satisfactory position of our Exchanges at the -moment is largely due to the general impression created by the Government1 s trade and financial pc-policy.    Moreover, the longer we remain with a depreciated paper&apos;currency, and the more it gets to be believod that w e are prepared to rest satisfied with such a currency, for a number of years at least, the more will the exchanger:; and finances of the world tend to be pivoted on Now York,     Unquestionably, the effect of this would be to damage the London Money Market, encourage American trade, and depress our own.To my mind, the arguments are overwhelming for an early resumption of cash payments, - if there is any real choice in the matter.     That there are great obstacles to surmount I am fully aware, and also that we shall have to proceed cautiously. If action were so sudden as to cause a rapid and substantial fall in prices, a crisis might be the result, followed by a long drawn out depression, in view particularly of the pre-vailing high wages and the losses that would be incurred on stocks in hand and orders already placed,&apos;   But w e can keep our face steadily in the right direction;, and opportunities will occur from timo to time to take considerable strides in advance.      I venture to think that we should make every effort to see that wo are in a position fully to seize them.    unavoidable-obly and unfortunately we have not been in such a position with regard to the opportunities of tho last year,    But other favourable opportunities will occur.    If prices should slumpible to take in much of the slack in the currency.it might be pogagainit early action is that it is toourOne argument used interest to allow our exchanges to operate as an encourage-ment of exports.    But the degree of encouragement affordedin this way cannot be, large and it tends to disappear.    It is clear that there is no encouragement insofar as prices and costs in this country advance in proportion to the depreciation of the exchange.r*l*&quot;
Ihe prospect of an early resumption of cash payments appears to ma to &quot;be the fmcLamental question.  Whether or ntot it is worth while to take up that part of the proposals brought forward by Sir La Worthington Evans whioh relates to the establishment of an Imperial inconvertible currency would seem to depend upon this&quot; to a large extentt    I observe that&apos;a number of objections to these proposals have already been emphasised, and there seem to be doubts as to whether certain parts of tie Empire would be prepared to subordinate themselves to the required extent; whether the imperfections of cable oommcmi--cations would permit of sufficiently prompt and satisfactory responses to local requirements and perhaps threatened, crises * and whether tDrade Bills would farnlsh enough or top much currency, and impose any effective check on a speculative rise -in prices.As to the end of maintaining a stable inter-Imperial Ex-change so long as there is no gold basis to give it* there can bo no question that, it would be desirable, assuming that it is attainable *   Whether or not it is advisable to take steps to secure it, depends in the first place upon the duration of the period that may be. expected to elapse before the gold basis is restored, which therefore seems to me to be the fundamental question raised.    There remains, of course, the further question of whether anything can be done to stabilise inter-Imperial, exchanges even after the restoration of the gold basis.    This question is certainly worth exploring.R.s.h.ome,3rd July 1920.
