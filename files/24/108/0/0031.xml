The last contingent of French troops left on 16th, thus completing the evacuation of the Schloswig Plebiscite Area.The transport and mon-of-war proceeded to Copenhagen, where they were entertained for two days by the Danish Government, sailing for United Kingdom Ports on 19th June.&apos;&quot;AGADIR&quot; proceeded to Apenrade to embark sick from Battle Cruiser Force and afterwards sailed for Southampton via ICiel Canal.Latvian Request to Purchase certain British Ships.8.N.O., Baltic, in reply to his telegram forwarding a request  rom the Latvian Government for the purchase of certain British ships has been informed that this request cannot be granted and that the Admiralty in reaching this decision was influenced by the fact that Latvia has received only &quot;de facto&quot; recognition.   This decision does not, however, affect minesweeping craft, the request for which will receive consideration when received through diplomatic channels.esthonia.The financial situation remains critical and H.M. Commissioner considers that, in order to improve matters, the following action is necessary, viz:-1. .. Proposed timber contracts should he concluded so that work can be started without delay. 2. .. Ssthonian bank to he Opened with access to foreign marKets. 5.     To raise one million sterling foreign credit on the15,000,000 roubles gold reserve now in Esthonia*naxvia.The Lettish Government has obtained permission from Admiralty to sail the es-Russian steamed KILDJIII with flax for England and return.&quot; The guarantee is, however, given without prejudice to claims of the Reparation Commission. S.S. PANIA with remnants of various Csarist Regiments and Lettish troops from Kolchak&apos;s Army, sailed for Libau from Shoemess on 16th
June, arrived at Copenhagen on the 19th aruL sailed again for &quot;^kibau the same day.  Prom reports received the troops appear diesattsfled with Allied treatment,   This attitude refleote that of the general Russian mind, which is always,ready to blame every and anybody exoept themselves.Finland.The Aaland Island controversy with Sweden remains acute, and the Swedish Minister at Helsingfors has &quot;been recalled to report on the situation.   H.M. Minister at Eelsingfors has heen instructed firmly to repudiate the recently current imputation that H.M. Government was averse to the question being raised at the Supreme Council by Sweden or by any of her numerous friends.   It is, however, pointed out that even if it is brought up the inclination will be to refer the whole Question to the League of Nations,   Meanwhile the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs has Informed H.M, Representative that there could be no question of Finland resisting Sweden by force of arms.The Swedish  ress is united in supporting the demands of the Aalanders, but at the same time expresses the hope that.it may be possible to maintain ftiendly relations with Finland.The Russian Soviet Peace Delegates have put forward the following conditions for the proposed armistice, viz:-1.   On Karelian Isthmus troops to remain in their present positions.3.   At frontier in Eastern Karelia and Ladoga a neutral zone to be made on both sides of 1914 frontier.3.   All movements of troops to be completed within seven .   days after signature of Armistice.4.   In Gulf of Finland following line of demarcation to be made which no men of war must cross - Styrsudd -Southern point of Seitskaer - Western point of Loevskaer in the direction of PyhajokK?) Merchant vossels may freely navigate Gulf of Finland,   An agreement respecting use of harbours shall bs coma to later.5.   Armistice to last a month ancl to continue automatic cally for periods of one month with five days notice on either side,The Finnish Delegates on the other hand, demand the following conditions for the Armistice:-1,   Evacuation by Soviet troops of Pechenga and RussianEarelia.8,   Armistice to be for a very short period and terminableat short notice. 3.   Peace negotiations not to be suspended on account ofthe Armistice.The Latvian offensive against the Bolsheviks continues, the line now having advanced from Matulova on Duva to N.E. corher of Jeluoa Lake.   Peace negotiations with the Soviet Government continue.Lithuania.The Government have decided on strict neutrality in the Polish-Bolshevik war in view of the attitude of the British Government.   Lithuania has concluded the purchase and charter of certain German steamers for the extension, of shipping traffic on the feroel.
Denmark,H.R.H. Prince Axel of Denmark has conclude! the purchase of the sloop &quot;ASPHODEL&quot; as she lies without armament,.   She is to proceed to Harwich with British navigating party where she will he taken over by the Danish Navy, the Danish Government bearing the cost of the passage from Plymouth.Poland and Ukraine.Owing to the moral effect of General BudennieTs Cavalry raid on the Polish Staff the, situation is serious.      British Mission,&apos; Warsaw, re-iterates demand for munitions which should have come on the &quot;JOLLY GEORGE&quot;, and points cut the serious effect the delay is having on the Polish morale. Reports from Kiev state that 15, 000 Polish-Ukraine troops were cut off in the recent Bolshevik raid. The Ukrainian public opinion now shows anti-Polish orientation.   Briefly summarised, the political situation is that the Ukrainian does not acknowledge the leader-ship of Petlura and, if anything, dislikes the Pole even more than he does the Bolshevik.   Co-operation between Ukrainians( and Poles however continues good and fighting spirit is excellent. The Polish occupied districts in the .Ukraine between the lines Zbruos end Dnieper are an important factor in the economic situation for the whole of Europe and Great Britain, as. these districts form one of the two granaries of the former Russian * Empire which exported vast quantities of grain to Europe.The Finnish Government have decided to recognise Petlura1^ Government as the de factc Government of Ukrainian Republic,&apos;. BLACK SSAAffD MEDITERRANEAN. ..L -,.,.^..i^l..n Lww.n i-iw. wmm*mmm*mm  **mm  m   .....--* 4Crimea.Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean reports that General Wrangel it his recent operations has acquired  territory from which he c;-n feed the Crimean population.   Ho considers that retention of this area and the maintenance of the morale in the rear will be gravely affected by the withdrawal of Naval, support and Mission.     Although it id understood that H.M. Government decided on this withdrawal of support due to Wrangel taking the offensive, Commander-in-Chief points out that Wrangel1s action was necessary in order to forestall the *Red offensive which, it is confirmed, Was to have taken place 48 hours later. Had Wrangel not attacked, the Crimea would have starved.In any case the former does not propose to advance beyond AlezaMrovsk-Melitopol line.   Great quantities of grain are reported captured,&apos; General Wrangel, through the Military Mission, implores H.M. Government to be on its guard against the untrustworthiness of the Bolshevik negotiations.   In any armistice negotiations he emphasised the following conditions:-1,    H,M, Government to conduci? negotiations as he cannot meetSoviet delegates. 2.    Retention of territory at Melitopol in order to feed his people.5.    Effective guarantees against Bolshevik attack.4.    Continued British support if Bolsheviks break the &apos;armistice. 5,     British Naval support.
*   10 british Missions,General Officer Commanding Constantinople has asked the War Office whether any liaison officers should he left at Sevastopol on withdrawal of the Mission and abserves.::that American and French Missions are remaining.    He also points out that Brigadier General Percy, Head of the Military Mission, has correctly stated that the withdrawal of the Mission will seriously affect the situation.    War Office in reply have asked for his observations as to the formation of an intelligence centre and. retention of British Officers for intelligence duties, in the Crimea.Admiralty have instructed Commander-in-Chief, Medit-erawss&amp;ijto conform to the War Office proposal, provided that no officer above the rank of Commander is left in charge, and that their duties are strictly confined to intelligence work.Armis11ce gego ti a11ons.The Soviet Government have addressed a long telegram (en clair) dated 16th June, to H.H. Government, in which they welcome the change of attitude of British Government to Wrangel^s offensive, but take the opportunity of pointing out that H.M. Government action has been dilatory and did not take lplace until after Wrangel had prepared his offensive under Allied assistance.   They now ask what further obstacles exist which can hold up the proposed negotiations.   Meanwhile it is reported that Wrangel is negotiating with the French Government for munitions and the latter are considering the matter sympathe-tically.Caucasus.Commander Luke reportes from Tiflis that it is offic-ially announced that peace has been signed between Georgia and Azerbaijan.   Georgian detachments have been forced to withdraw under procure from Ossetian forces.&apos;  They have however been able to reinforce Gori.S.S. &quot;EORNSEA&quot; sailed, 10th June, with munitions for Armenia via Georgia port Batoum.   It is unlikely, however, that  , the Georgians will let them through? meanwhile the Georgians are informed that it is hoped to supply them independently when supplies are available.A representative of the Foreign Office has left England for Batum to negotiate with the Georgians.   Ee is to endeavour to secure conditions of free transit over the Caucasian Railway, and free use of the port of Batum, for the Republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.Upon conclusion of this agreement, Batum will be handed over to the Georgian Government and the Allied forces withdrawn.The Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, reports that information has been received, via Tiflis, that British prisoners at Baku are being disgracefully treated in the common goal. He requests authority, as present negotiations cannot effect release, to use the Fleet to. take measures of reprisal, such as a raid on Novorossisk, or the coast to the southward, to obtain hostages.
On the other hand, Naval Mission, Kasvin, reports that information has been received that the British prisoners at Baku are reasonably treated and have quite sufficient food, and that no danger to life is expected while Bolshevik fortunes&apos; are good,Batoum,Referring to the proposed evacuation and turning over to Georgia of the town of Batoum, the Foreign Office have informed Admiral de Robeck that the proposed date, SOth June,&apos; is too early as it is not possible to make the necessary arrange-ments.     Separate instructions with regard to the withdrawal from Tiflio will be sent.     He is asked for his advice on the latter operation.    Commander Luke once more re-iterates the often repeated warning given by Mr, Wardrop, that British prestige will receive a deadly blow which will re-act from Trans-Caspia to the Indian frontier, the repercussion being felt in India and Persia in.no little degree.Trans-caspia.The following is a brief summary and forecast of future Bolshevik policy in this area based on agent&apos;&apos;s reports and other sources.   It is of Naval interest as this policy will eventually re-act on the Persian Gulf question in the&quot;future.   In 1918, owing to the presence of British 1ao troops in Trans-Caspia, the Turk was compelled to abandon his idea of a direct advance along Central Asian Railway5 he concentrated his attention on the Yamut stoppes, South of Krasnovodsk and particularly that portion&apos; contained in the tr^ngle formed by the railway line, Caspian Sea and River Atrek.   The plan was to supply the Yamuts with arms and thus start guerilla bands which would eliminate Russian and Persian influence from the Astarabad region.      This plan depended on the Turkoman, who readily   swallowed the bait.   Subsequently, however, there was a complete volte face to the side of the British owing *to the Turkish crash and presence of British troops in Trans-Caspia.   However/ owing to the recently effected domination of the Caspian by the Bolsheviks and a strong Moslem movement approaching from the West of the Caspian, the Turkoman attitude has again changed and is once more against the British.   They continue to wait to see the Bolshevik attitude towards the Moslem population in general and the Turkomans in particular.   There are indications that this policy will be pacific and everything clone to induce the Turkoman to return to his country;   With the sp ?aad of Bolshevik guided pan-Islamic propaganda^,   a very powerful lever will be in the hands of the Soviet to be used against Persia . through the threat on the North and North-Eastern Persian frontiers.   These aggressive threats against Persia point to the Bolshevik necessity^of stabilising the Trans-Caspian situation by linking up Azerbaijan and Turkey in an alliance with them.We must therefore expect that our Persian policy and especially that in which we hope to build up a Persian defensive Naval Force will be thwarted at every turn.Siberia.No material change.   The French Government have requested that preparations be made at the request of the French General at the port, for the evacuation by and after 15th July of 3,000 Czechs from Vladivostock,
TUREJJYThe &quot;LoyalTT Turkish troops in the Ismid Area have &quot;declared their inability to maintain their present positions&quot;. On the morning of the 14th June, being attacked by the Nationalists, they withdrew inside our wire, and were disarmed and evacuated to ships.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, has renewed his urgent requests for reinforcements of aircraft, for purposes of co-operation of the Fleet with the Army.The whole of the Southern Coast of the Sea of Ifeaaora except the shores of the Dardanelles, and the Ismid Peninsula, is now in the possession of the Nationalists,On the morning of the 15th June, Nationalist forces delivered three attacks on our positions at Ismid. The enemy have worked round to the North, and bands are reported near the Railway as far west as Gebze. Traffic is not now running further East than Tuzla.The Nationalists have entrenched on the hills to the North and East of Ismid and have shelled our position.   Their trenches and gun positions have been fired on by H.M. Ships.General Milne proposes to retire to the line Tuzla -Riwa Bere, after destroying ammunition dumps and evacuating stores at Derindje, and to endeavour to hold that front. Instructions have been giuen for the destruction of guns and . ammunition dumps on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles, in order to avoid the necessity of guards.Oomr-iander-in-GThief, Mediterranean considers the retire-ment to the Tuzla-Riwa Dere line will make the position in Scutari and Constantinople increasingly dangerous and will be represented as a Turkish victory.   Also thai it is a question if the army can, on this new line, prevent Nationalist bands entering Scutari and Constantinople and raising the population.The &quot;GOEBEN&quot; has been removed from Ismid to Tuzla.H.M. Ships at Ismid are &quot;RAMLL1IE3&quot;, &quot;SIRDAR&quot;,&quot;VBNETIA&quot; &quot;WESTCOTT&quot;, &quot;PEGASUS&quot; and &quot;ARE ROYAL&quot;.&quot;ROYAL SOVEREIGN&quot; is at Shils (Black Sea Coast) and &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot; and &quot;YIDETTE&quot; at Chanak,Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean has been informed that if there is any danger of the Nationalists making use of the guns ar fortifications on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles or Eosporus to threaten Allied shipping, steps should be taken to render them non-effective.1st Battle Squadron is due to return for docking and refit in July but in view of the situation &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot;, and &quot;RESOLUTION&quot; only will return, &quot;RAMILLIES&quot;, &quot;REVENGE&quot; and -&quot;ROYAL SOVEREIGN&quot; remaining in E, Mediterranean waters for another month.
Air Ministry are preparing to send a squadron of D.H. 9, machines from EGYPT to CON&amp;MTBtOPLE..Commander-in-chief-, Mediterranean reported,  1.6.20, that as a result of vigorous bombardment by &quot;RAMILLIES&quot; end other ships, under Vice Admiral, 1st Battle Squadron,&apos; combined with seaplane attacks, the Nationalists have been driven some miles from ISMID, with heavy losses both of men and&quot;&apos;mo rale. The danger to ISMID was thereby relieved but irregular bands in some strength were still operating weatward from ISMID.One of the main reasons for the Allied occupation of Constantinople was to put a stop to Nationalist activities in the capital and the surrounding districts.   If we now allow the Nationalists to get control of the Ismid Peninsula the position at Constantinople becomes impossible.The maintenance of control over the Ismid Peninsula ,1s as much the concern of the French and Italians as of ourselves and they should provide their quota of the troops required. This they show no-signs of doing.Nationalist forces have occupied Aghva (Black Sea Coast, due N. of Ismid) and the island of Marmora in the Sea of Marmora. An attempt to levy recruits in Gallipoli has been checked by Allied action.   They now occupy all Anatolia except the Smyrna area and the Ismid Peninsula, and have large quantities of munitions and ample reinforcements available.The following British Officers and rank and file are at present detained in Asid. Minor by the Nationalists, 4 Lieutenant-Colonel A. Rawlinson, R.A. and a party of 5. Captain C.L. Campbell, A. &amp; S.H. with 2 N,COTs and 12 Sepoys of 25th Punjabis.Mustapha Xemal has v.Titten to Tohicherin expressing a desire to inter- into diplomatic relations with Soviet RiLssia at once.   Tchieherin in his reply notes with satisfaction that the Nationalist Programme is in full accord with Soviet prin-ciples, and wishes Kustapha Kemal every success in his present struggle and expresses willingness to send diplomatic and consular representatives to Turkey.Terms of the Armistice between General Gouraud and Mustapha lemal.1.     To commence midnight -29 th--30 th Mayo2.    Bozanti and Sis to be evacuated and garrisons withdrawn to Adana.3,    Aintab to be evacuated on the understanding that no fresh attacks are made against the Armenian quarter. .4.     Evacuations to be completed-within 10 days. 5.    Exchange of prisoners to be arranged.Thrace.The Greeks now hold all W. Thrace fp to the Maritza. The Turks appear to have made no resistance.The ISest bank of the Maritza, the bridgehead at Kukliburgas and posts on the Northern frontier are held by the Greeks.   The situation is quiet, and likely to remain so until the Greeks move East.
, The-J5eiro&amp;. jlirvla^ to remain, in W.Thracewhile the S others move into Eastern Thrac-o- via iLflrianonlewaniU.. l^emDtdnka.   Two divisions are being prepared at Salonica to be landed East and West of Rodosto.The Greek commanders feel secure and consider the moment for any resistance on the part of the Turks is past. The Turks remain firm, however, in their old determination to resist any move into E. Thrace, and this remains the chief factor in the situation.   They are said to have plenty of ammunition, and even heavy artillery obtained from the Bulgarian frontier and have become aware of reports $mm^ Paris to the effect that neither France or Italy propose to assist the Greeks to obtain by force territorial gains from Turkey. Bulgarian coaitadji may also be expected to maksr trouble for the Greeks.:-.&apos;C:--&apos; *A report of the 15th June announced that Armenia had signed Peace with Soviet Russia.The Americans are returning to Armenia to carry on their relief work.   The general position of the Armenian race appears, however, to be desperate, and in Cilicia has probably never been worse, in spite of the fact that the armistice between General Gouraud and Mustapha Kemal contains provisions for its sefety,ITAXYAdriatic Question.3a G;,olitti is believed to hold the following views-.-There is no need to expedite an Adriatic settlement and Italy will continue to base her position on the fact of London. If the Jugo-Slavs wish to continue the recent negotiations it is for them to make the first advances and to submit proposals.   Meanwhile Italy, in accordance with the Armistice.... terms, is in possession of the disputed territory and this affords her the best of guarantees.-Flume.S. Gi&amp;litti is anxious to obtain a settlement of the Fiume question with all possible speed, and will probably attempt to do so by means of an agreement with drAnnunsio for the substitution of regular troops for the latter&quot;s irregular forces.   At the same time Giolitti will pledge himself to support annexation of Piume.Tripoli.The capture by Arabs of the Italian Commissioner and &apos; some 50 Italians at Garian is reported.   This incident affords fresh evidence that the general situation in Tripoli is becoming yet more serious.The &quot;Roma&quot; left Gibraltar on the 16th instant en route for Las Palmas and S. American ports.

She is for use in the Navy and when completed will first be employed as leader of a mine sweeping flotilla.   She is 37 m, long, 7 m. broad, and draws 4 m.   Her/displacement is 470 tons and she has a triple-expansion 600 H.P, engine.syriaThe armistice arranged between the French and the Turkish Nationalists was drawn up at Angora by Mo de Caix, Secretary General to the French High Commissioner, and Mustapha Kemal. Under the terms of the armistice the French troops were to be allowed to withdraw from Bozanti and Sis to Tarsus   and Aleppo and from Aintab to a certain distance outside the town. Guarantees were given for the safety of the Armenians4at Aintab.   Bozanti however had already surrendered before the armistice and about 550, French troops were capturedo.The armistice has seriously alarmed the Emir Eeisal, who fears that the withdrawal of French troops from a large part of Northern Syria and Cilicia and its abandonment to the Turks will be the commencement of a series of defeats in the near East,  in which not only the French but all the Allies will bo involved, and which will soon menace the peace of Mesopotamia, Mosul and other places.Feisal calls tho attention of the British Government to his apprehension in the hope that the latter will be able to take steps to safeguard Syria.In view of the above it is interesting to note that, according&apos; to a report from Beirut, Feisul was expected at Aleppo on June 15th, his object being to meet emissaries from Mustapha kemal.The Minister of Marine has put forward a proposal for the construction of 12 submarines, in addition to the 6 light Cruisers and 12 Flotilla Leaders already projected, -S.S. &quot;0LGA&quot; has arrived safely at Brest and is discharging munitions.germany at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven the commissioned officers have been reinstated after an absence from their posts of three months1 duration.The men sign on for 12 years in the navy, but disappear when anything displeases them.
Tho.ro are onlyiwo destroyers, Y&apos;6 and year, In commission at Kiel, and about the sameOoumber at Wilhelmsliavon. At the latter port, the authorities are trying to get the Battleships &quot;RAMOTER&quot; and nBHAUlIgC^SIGM and the Light Cruiser &quot;HAMBUBG&quot; ready for commissioning, but the officer reporting states that,-from their appearance, it looks as if they would not be roady for months. &apos; - *The surrender of war vessels is about half completed, and provided there are no political upheavals in between, should be completed by September.The surrender of Docks, etc., has not commenced and can hardly be in full swing before next Spring as nearly all the Docks, Dredgers, otc are unseaworthy, and have to be fitted foj? towing; the local opposition is very strong, in places, stronger than the Government.The reduction of the 21 aval personnel is practically completed,The destruction of war material has just commenced and will be a lengthy business, as amongst other things, some 15,000 factories have to be inspected and the material in them dealt with in somo way or another.The work in Heligoland is going on very well; tho armament is almost completely destroyed and the filling up of the war harbour has commenced.   The. programme extends well into the summer of 1922.AUSTRIATho Government has resigned over the question of soldiers councils in the army, and. so far no agreement has been possible between political parties for the formation of a new one. The Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists are the principal parties * Both desire new elections, for which an election law is necessary.AFRICAVice Admiral Sir E.S. Fitsherbert transferred the Command of the African Station to Rear Admiral Sir W.E. Goodenough on the 18th June.MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE Abartay Lightship replaced.&apos;The Dundee Harbour Trust will endeavour to replace the Abertay Lightship on her station on or about 1st July, as weather permits.Canteen Profits.At a meeting of the Comrades of the Great War at Plymouth on the 14th June, a resolution allocating one third of the ex-Service men&apos;s share of Canteen Profits to the U.S. Fund and the remaining two thirds to the proposed R.N. Benevolent Trust Fund, was carried unanimously.
Sea Training for Boys.The Admiralty and Board of Trade are giving their support to the proposal to establish a Training Ship for West Country &quot;boys in the Bristol Channel.Admiralty Oil Fuel Tanks at BorehavonIn view of the possibility of an attack on the Oil Fuel tanks at Berehaven, it has boen decided to empty them.H.M.S. &quot;IEMBRAIKS11 is now cruising in Irish Waters and &apos; Has &quot;visited lullary Bay and Buncrana during the past woekAttacks on Coatsguarc^ Stations.The War Signal Station at Malinmore was attacked by armed raiders and destroyed by fire on the night of the 17th June,   The Coastguard Station at Baltimore was threatened with attack on the same night. A Marine Guard was in occu-pation of the station, and a party was landed from H.M.S. &quot;TR2HCEAIT&quot;.   The attack did not materialise.General Situation in Ireland,The refusal of railwaymen and dockers to handle munitions and military stores continues, and all negotiations have proved abortive, including the meeting between the Executive of the national Union of Railwayman and the Prime Minister on Saturday 19th Juno.   The general situation has not improved,   Attacks on Police Barracks have not been so numerous, but the shooting of individual members of the Royal Irish Constabulary is again becoming frequent. The morale of the Royal Irish Constabulary has considerably improved during the past few weeks.S.F. Courts of Justice have been held during the&quot;week.near Cork ,.
