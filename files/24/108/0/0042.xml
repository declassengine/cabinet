Are we looking ahead at all and making up our minds what we shall do if there 0149 is a complete Polish collapse and if Poland is over-run by the Bolshevik, armies or its 7 Government overturned by an internal Bolshevik uprising \ Would it be the policy of the British Government to remain impassive in the face of such an event, which may iDeXcOTceivably) near ? If so, what would be the policy of the French Government ? In the event of the collapse of Poland, what reaction would this situation entail upon the German position? It would clearly not be possible to disarm Germany if her eastern frontiers were in contact with a Bolshevized area. I have heard from the French Minister of War that this aspect is contemplated with grave anxiety, as it is believed to be capable of upsetting the Peace Treaty. We ought, at any rate, to consider in advance what our line of action should be.2. Suppose the Krassin negotiations fail, as they very likely will, or, again,-suppose that some sort of purely commercial arrangement is made on a very small scale without any political peace being reached, are we going to allow the Bolshevik propaganda and menace to our Eastern possessions, which they are deliberately working up, to continue unchecked while we watch the triumph of the Bolshevik armies over Poland and the enormous accession of prestige in Russia which these armies will gain from such a triumph ? If so, will our position not be very much worse than it is at the present time ?The Cabinet shows itself very indisposed towards the withdrawal from the dangerous places in Persia and Mesopotamia, which both military and financial arguments recommend. The failure of the Krassin negotiations, coupled with the growing triumph of Bolshevik Russia over Poland, will certainly create a most grave situation for us throughout the East.The one thing which it is really worth while for us to get out of the Krassin negotiations is a peace with the Bolsheviks so far as our Eastern possessions are concerned. Is there any real chance of this ? Will that chance be greater or less after the Poles have been defeated and, perhaps, overwhelmed ?3. Wrangel&apos;s position is clearly set out in the attached telegrams and letters. As soon as the Bolsheviks are able to divert their main strength from Poland, they will of course crush him. What will when happen to all the people in the Crimea ? We may, of course, stand by callously and watch, their destruction ; but however indifferent we are to this horror, some inconveniences will fall upon us. As is pointed out by Admiral de Robeck, very great numbers of refugees, representing all classes and persons of every age and sex, will crowd on board the considerable number of Russian ships available and descend upon Constantinople, destitute, starving, and racked with typhus. What are we going to do then ? What will be the position of Constantinople then ?   At any rate, these matters should be considered, in advance.w. s. c.The War Office,26th June, 1920.
Political.. Turkey.Admiral de Robeck, Constantinople.(Despatched 11.6 a.m., 5th June, 1920, received 11 a.m., 6th June, 1920.) (No. 657.   R.)Admiral Hope has communicated in writing contents of your telegram No. 488, to General Wrangel, who stated in reply that conditions in Crimea have changed considerably since he took command. Army very much improved, but food situation becoming critical. He has already informed British Government that he cannot negotiate with Soviets, and that he has not sufficient food for army and population.As only alternative to evacuation or capitulation is increase of food supplies, he is forced to make offensive to obtain more food-producing territory, and has given orders to that effect. He wishes His Majesty&apos;s Government to understand that this is being done not with any aggressive intention, but solely to obtain food. Wrangel will hand written reply to Admiral Hope to-day, 5th June, who will bring it to Constantinople. Krivoshein informed Admiral Hope that while he was in Paris French Government advised that Wrangel should not enter into negotiations with Soviets, and that French would try to persuade London not to press matter. His Majesty&apos;s ship (name undecipherable) perceived sea and land expedition on considerable scale preparing at Theodosia for unknown objective. His Majest.y&apos;s ships have orders not to assist if offensive operations are commenced by Wrangel. Wrangel has now a large army, well equipped and disciplined, and is an important factor in general situation.Turkey.Political.Admiral de Robeck, Constantinople.(Despatched 11.40 p.m., 6th June, 1920, received 9 a.m., 7th June, 1920.)(No. 662.   R.)Yery urgent. My telegram No. 657 (? 5th June).Summary of Wrangefs written reply, brought by Admiral Hope, is as follows. Full text follows by bag : Wrangel cannot negotiate directly, himself, with Soviet. His Majesty&apos;s Government having expressed readiness to negotiate for him should make choice of place for negotiations. Food crisis in Crimea is acute. Offensive essential to relief of this and for other military reasons. Wrangel states he attaches utmost importance to guarantee for observing any agreement arrived at in negotiations. He instances Bolshevik behaviour in Kuban and Georgia. In effect he asks what guarantee His Majesty&apos;s Government could exact and enforce from Soviet. Finally, he hopes that until question of guarantees is explicitly settled His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to give him support, that is precious to him.   End of summary.FrommCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Afloat, vid Rinella Gleethorpes,to Admiralty.(No. 43 Z.) 12th April, 1920, 1.10 p.m.It is reported from military source and confirmed by seaplanes of H.M.S. &quot; Pegasus &quot; that Reds are concentrating for attack on North Crimea. With a little Allied support this could be met with confidence. Without it resistance may fail. In the latter case, even if we send no ships to evacuate, there will be thousands who will come away in Russian men-of-war and Russian merchant ships for whom provision will have to be made.   It seems very desirable (? to) avoid this eventuality.
(Copy of decipher telegram.) From Commander-m-Chief, Mediterranean Afloat, yi&amp;W/T., to Admiralty.(No. 215 Z.) Beceived 8.22 p.m., 19th June, 1920.Concerning Crimea, following is recapitulation of facts. Wrangel has acquired new territory (? from which) he can feed the Crimea. Retention of this and maintenance of morale in rear will be gravely affected by the withdrawal of our support and mission. Reason for our withdrawal understood to be due to Wrangel taking offensive. His offensive forestalled Red offensive by (? 48) hours. The above confirmed by documents on prisoners. Gas installation and masks found ready for use by Reds inside (their) original line.   To be continued.No. 216 Z. (continuation of No. 216 Z.).Red invasion, which R.A. fleet was to assist in repelling, was therefore forestalled by Wrangel, who took the only proper measures to safeguard Crimea, which was a condition of our negotiations and which Reds were about to disregard. Had Wrangel not attacked, Crimea would have starved and capitulated later. Any assistance of ours would have been unavailing. Wrangel does, not wish to advance beyond Alexandrosk-Melitopol line.To be continued.(8342)From General Officer Commanding, Constantinople, to War Office.(Despatched 1920, 15th June, received 1500, 15th June, 1920, 2130.)(No. I. 8795, cipher.)Following from Percy, Denikins Mission : &quot;(No. P.S. 19, 13th June.)( (    &apos;This morning I interviewed Wrangel, and he informs me that there is conclusive (evidence from (?)). (two groups omitted) prisoners and (group undecipherable) (?) indications that Bolsheviks had (?) ordered attack on Crimea to take place 9th June. Wrangefs attack progresses well. An east and west line, extending from Melitopol to Kakovka on the River Dneiper, has been reached, and his cavalry is forward of (?) this line. The final position he intends to occupy is a line just east of the enemy&apos;s (? Ale)xan-drovsk Melitopol railway. Having acquired this area, Wrangel feels satisfied that he (? can) support his army, his population and the refugees who are now provided for by the Allies. The Crimean territory alone is insufficient for his needs. 8,000 prisoners, 30 guns and 200 machine guns have been captured. (?) Great quantities of grain &quot;have been.discovered and consider a large amount can be exported for use of Allies; am forwarding my figures in a few (?) days. Wrangel again implores me to impress on His Majestys Government untrustworthiness of the nature of the Bolsheviks as he fears the Allies themselves will only discover it when it is too late.- Wrangel says if negotiations must take place he places himself (?) unreservedly in the hands of British Government, but that he cannot himself personally, have any dealing with the Bolsheviks. Wrangel asks for definite and urgent reply to following questions which are of vital importance to (?) him (?) in order that he may make plans for the future : 1st. Will not Government make terms for him (?), without (group undecipherable)personal dealing with Soviet ? 2nd. Cannot the territory he has acquired remain in his possession by terms of armistice as it is necessary to feed his people ? 3rd. As he already holds this territory without agreement, very careful guaranteesbe given that he will not be attacked by the Bolsheviks. 4th. In the event of Bolsheviks guarantees failing to prove real, may he at leastrely on our material assistance ? 5th. Are we going to continue supporting him, both morally and materially as in ^ the past ?&quot;
Dear Sir William, 20th April, 1920.Events in Russia have now reached a stage which may be described as containing the elements of a certain finality. A great phase of the Revolution has come to an end and the Soviet Government, nominally at least, sways power practically over the whole of European Russia and more than half of Siberia. The purely Russian forces opposing Bolshevism have been defeated, it is true, not so much by their enemies as by lack of organizing instinct. They now hold but one little corner of their country, the Crimean Peninsula, and precariously at that. Their outlook is dark indeed, and the time is perhaps not far off when they too will be compelled to join the thousands of their compatriots who are now scattered broadcast throughout the world.Since the Bolshevist Revolution, Great Britain, anxious to prevent the alien population of Old Russia from falling an easy prey to the nefarious doctrines of Bolshevism, has not spared any effort in assisting the new-born border States to gain sufficient virility in order to allow them to stem the tide of encroaching Communism. Up to the present, the moral and material support granted to the border States by Great Britain has met with complete success. Under the aegis of British protection these States are gradually developing the somewhat embryonic civilizations particularly suited to their various characters.As regards what, for lack of a better term, I will call National Russia, as distinct from Soviet Russia the situation is different. Citizens of National Russia, whose fate is at present at its lowest ebb. will never forget the inestimable services rendered to their cause by the unstinted co-operation of this country in their struggle against Bolshevism. They will ever remember that the ultimate failure of tbis joint activity is due in an infinitely greater measure to their own shortcomings rather than to any slackening of good will and assistance from outside. This assistance now having, to all intents and purposes,&quot; practically ceased, they cannot, however, depart from the view that temperamentally they are quite as foreign to Bolshevism, if not more so, as any of the border nationalities which continue to enjoy the protection of Great Britain.Dear Sir Archibald, .21st June, 1920.The information I can give you is unfortunately but&quot; of a fragmentary nature, as, you are no doubt aware that our communication with General Wrangefs territory is sporadic and rare. Nevertheless, I can.emphatically confirm your information as to the great number of refugees who have taken shelter from Soviet Russia in the Crimea and behind General Wrangel&apos;s front. I do not think that the total of 900,000 which you mention is in any way exaggerated.With regard to the more detailed information which you request me to give you,&apos;I ean tell you that Sebastopol is full of disabled and wounded military and naval officers and men who are receiving medical attention in the hospitals there. 1Almost all the professors of Kieff and KharkofY Universities are congregated at Simferopol, as well as many prominent manufacturers and merchants.s The town of Yalta harbours the professors of the Odessa University, and such people, well known to Russians, as, for instance, the authors, Elpatievsky and Yoloshin; the painter, Stilman, and the composer, Spendiaroff. Ex-members of the Duma and the Council of the Empire are likewise staying in that town.A large number of Sisters of Charity and Nurses who rendered inestimable services during the war, have now sought refuge at Eupatoria, where numerous priests and ecclesiastical dignitaries, especially from Kharkoff and the north, have also found a domicile.The town of Theodosia has become the. refuge of the families of such well-known painters as Aivazovsky and Bogayevsky, and professors such as Yunge, Maklakoff, and Krym, while Kertch is also overflowing with the same category of people.I could give you many more names, but fear that they would not serve your purpose, as they are mostly known to Russians only.Perhaps you will allow me to enclose herewith, for your information, the copy of a letter, with an enclosure which Sabline recently handed to Sir William Tyrrell of the Foreign Office. I think these documents may prove of some value in the general estimation of the situation in South Russia.G. WOLKOFF.
On these grounds, therefore, they look to the traditional sense of justice of the British nation, and would fain consider themselves entitled to treatment similar to that accorded to the Border States.There can be but little doubt that, hopeless as the case of National Russia may at present seem, the time will come when her scattered citizens, comprising as they do * the great majority of intellectual and educated elements, will inevitably get into closer touch with the bulk of the Russian population and will then be in a position to guide it back to a normal and healthy life on the basis of a broad and liberal constitution, free from the tyrannies of both extreme wings. The countless representatives of commerce, industry, law, science and the arts, who have been obliged to seek temporary shelter in more hospitable parts of the world are bound, at a given moment, to be called back to their country with a view to assist their less fortunate bretheren who are pining under the Soviet regime, in the reconstruction of a new and happier Russia.I would venture to suggest, however, that the diffusion of all these potential elements is not conducive to the preliminary spade-work for such reconstruction. It would seem to me of primary importance that the men upon whose shoulders will fall the arduous task of laying the foundations for the revival of their country on better lines should be afforded the possibility of meeting on their own soil for their responsible work. Such a spot, where they would find surroundings infinitely preferable to any of those afforded by European capitals, still exists, and I need hardly mention that by this I mean the Crimea.But the Crimea can only be used for the above purpose if those who return there can do so with a full sense of security. To work under the constant threat of an eventual invasion and flight would be worse than useless.The attitude of Great Britain towards this question is, if I may say so, of paramount importance. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government deem it appropriate to extend to the Crimea the same protection which it has so successfully accorded to the Border States, thereby affording Russian Nationalist s the possibility of pursuing their work in peace and tranquility, the name of Great Britain would be blessed for many generations to come. The mere fact that, owing to this country&apos;s action, Russian patriots will be able to return if only to a small but safe portion of their native land, will enhance a hundredfold the prestige of Great Britain in the eyes of those who, through force of circumstances, cannot fail to become instrumental in the shaping of Russia&apos;s destiny.Experience unfortunately shows that but slender faith can be placed in any guarantee offered by the Soviet Government, a circumstance which makes it impossible to hope that that Government would adhere to its promises regarding an amnesty any more than it has carried out similar engagements elsewhere.I should, therefore, be extremely grateful if you would be so kind as to lay these considerations before His Majesty&apos;s Government, and let me know in due course whether the proposals contained in this letter meet with their approval.It is an indisputable fact that Russia is now divided into two distinctly separate camps, the Bolshevists and the anti-Bolshevists. If, on the one hand, the civilized countries of Europe are, by the force of circumstance, obliged to accept the existence of Soviet Russia, it would seem to follow, on the other, that they must equally admit the existence of a great anti-Soviet Russia, which, although almost deprived of territory, is at least as important a factor in the community of world nations as her rival.The admission of the above premises leads inevitably to the question of what can be done in order to permit anti-Soviet Russia to constitute herself at least on a basis similar to &quot;that of the newly-formed Border States.With thisobject in view, I would submit: (1.) That a sovereign Russian State be created, consisting of the Crimea with a reasonable hinterland, and the Cossack Confederation (Don, Terek and Kouban).(2.) That this State be named the Crimean-Cossack Federation.(3.) That the Allies be requested to demand that the Soviet Government should forego all interest in and influence over-the above territories, and that, as a result thereof, these territories be proclaimed, by an agreement between the Allies and the Soviet Government, independent and free from Bolshevik pretensions.(4.) That the creation of such a State, comprising as it does the most fertile regions of Russia, and at the same time being the least infected by Bolshevism, will in every way facilitate the exchange of agricultural and industrial produce,
/Sir William Tyrrell, K.C.M.G., C.B., Foreign Office.and in general, re-establish normal commercial intercourse between the-Allies and Eussia. From a purely political point of view, the creation of a Russian Crimean-Cossack State, while ensuring the tranquility of the Caucasus and Northern Persia, would establish a barrier between the Bolsheviks and the Young Turks.(5.) That the system of government be officially proclaimed as based upon a strictly democratic foundation.(6.) That the land problem and labour legislation of the new State be immediately considered, and radically solved.(7.) That the question of commerce with Great Britain and Europe as a whole), receive immediate attention, and the Allies be requested to assist in infusing new life into local transport and industry by importing locomotives, rolling stock, agricultural machines, and manufactured goods, and creating a new currency in exchange for the export of raw materials, &amp;c.(8.) That, with this purpose in view, Great Britain be requested to send to those territories a Special Commission, which would enter into direct relations with the Governments on the spot.(9.) That the Crimean-Cossack Federation gradually enter, as circumstances may allow, into political and economic agreements with its neighbours) thereby establishing a workable modus vivendi dictated by the exigencies of the moment.(10.) That the Federation be in a position, as a free and independent State, to enter into formal agreements, even with Soviet Russia, in order to obtain such practical advantages as have been achieved in the case of Esthonia, Latvia, and others.(11.) That, given the bringing about of such conditions, the Crimean-Cossack Federation will become the living and prosperous nucleus of a National and Democratic Russia from which it will be possible in future to extend a helping hand to the remaining parts of Great Russia.
