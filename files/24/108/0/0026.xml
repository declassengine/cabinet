The Anglo-French Petroleum&apos; Agreement and Mesopotamia. Memorandum by the Minister in Charge of Petroleum Department.I now circulate copies of the An^lo-French Petroleum      i Agreement and of a letter sent by Sir John Cadman to M.Benard in explanation of some supplementary points raised by the French Government. , IThe most important part of the Agreement deals with Mesopotamia, and in this His Majesty1a Government has retpined com-plete freedom of action as to the method of development to be pursued.It has now become increasingly important to reach a decision on the policy to be followed in Mesopotamia/ and I invite attention to my memorandum of 22nd April (CP .1118) on this subject. The two main alternatives are:-(1)   To develop the oilfields as a State undertaking, either by direct,Government operation or through the agency of a commercial company. (2)   To leave the fields to be worked by private enterprise,Government taking a substantial share of the production by way of royalty.In regard to (1), if it is decided to carry on the development by a State.undertaking, the capital required would be very large (probably  10,000,000 or even , 15,000,000) and it would be extremely difficult to secure the necessary staff.A large producing,company has volunteered proposals as to the terms on which it vould be prepared to develoo the fieldsIon behalf of Government.   These indicate that, while operating with government
Government capital or with its own capital advanced at current rates of Interest, it would expect to receive a large share of the profits.   The adoption of such a scheme would apparently also involve, under the terms of the Turkish Treaty, the payment of compensation,to Interests which held pre-war rights from the Turkish Government. ;,In regard to (2), it may be mentioned that operating companies could probably make terms with the tribes for the protection of the- oilfields, as has been done very successfully in Persia, and that garrisons of European or Indian Troops would not have to be maintained for this purpose.Under this scheme the Mesopotamian Government would, without risk or cost, obtain a substantial revenue from the fields if oil in commercial quantities were found.    Arrangements could fee made for royalty on a sliding scale which would prevent excessive profits being secured by the companies.Should operation by private enterprise be approved, I consider that the rights secured by the Turkish Petroleum Company before the war should be recognised and confirmed. f   If this course is adopted and a moderate additional participation is given to the Royal Dutch-Shell in order to secure British control of the group, it appears advisable that the management should not be in its hands as previously proposed, but that it should be vested in the new company, to which each of the participating groups would contribute experienced staff.    This company would be permanently British, with Government representation on the Board.      Should the Ro^ai Dutch-Shell group not be prepared to come under British control on these terms, their participation in Mesopotamia would revert to the percentage (25) to which they were entitled under the 1914 Agreement,F.

It is, however, clearly understood that any oilfields which are at presont known, or may in futuro be discovered In Mesopotamia and over which Great . Britain holds the mandate, will be covered by tho wording of the agreement,On the second point, viz, the meaning of 25 per cent. Of the net output of crude oil at current market prices, I dis^ Cussed this question very fully with I,l,Bertheldt and we agreed that such a concession would be valuable in giving France a secure hold on 25 per cent, of the cutput of crude oil and that, as any government action Yfhich might be taken to develop the oilfields would be carried out solely by and on behalf of the Ilesopotamian Government, France should pay for the oil at current market rates.    Such rates would, of course, equally be paid by Great Britain or any other purchaser for any oil which they might purchase.     It was not intended in the agreement to place France at any disadvantage in regard to the price of oil as compared with Great Britain.As to tho point at which the crude oil would&quot; be^&apos;deliveredIons, Georges Be&quot;nard.,
delivered, this will he a matter for arrangement, hut it was understood that Prance would take delivery at a point contiguous to the pipo-line, and if any other arrangement is desired it can only be settled by mutual agreement.In respect to Persian oil, LUBerthelot will recollect that the arrangement that His Majesty1a Government would support Prance*s request to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for 25 per cent, of the oil piped to the Mediterranean was in return for such facilities as might be given by Prance to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to lay a pipe-line through the French spheres of influence,    It was also understood that, should the pipe-line traverse an area the mandatory rights of which Prance had transferred to Great Britain, the same support would be afforded to Prance,    Further than this it is not possible for me to go,I trust this explanation will cover the points upon which M, Berthelot seems to have some doubt.Yours sincerely,,(Sd,)   JOHN CADMANo &apos;
y    [This Document is the Property of His Britamiu MajestyB Government.!VERY secret copy No. ^MEMORANDUM OP AGREEMENT between M. Philippe Berthelot, Directeur des Affaires politiques et commerciales au Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres, and Professor Sir John Cadman, K.C.M.G., Director in Charge of His Majesty&apos;s Petroleum Department.BY order of the two Governments of France and Great Britain, the undersigned representatives have resumed, by mutual consent, the consideration of an agreement regarding petroleum.2, This agreement is based on the principles of cordial co-operation and reciprocity in those countries where the oil interests of the two nations can be usefully united. This memorandum relates to the following States or countries :-Roumania, Asia Minor, territories of the old Russian Empire, iGalicia, French Colonies and British Grown Colonies.3. The agreement may be extended to other countries by mutual consent.4. Roumania. The British and French Governments shall support their respective nationals&apos; in any common negotiations to be entered into with the Government of Roumania for (a.) The acquisition of oil concessions, shares or other interests belonging to former enemy subjects or bodies in Roumania which have been sequestrated, e.g., the Steaua Romana, Ooncordia, Vega, &amp;c, which constituted in that country the oil groups of the Deutsche Bank, and of the Disconto Gesellschaft; together with any other interests that may be obtainable.(6.) Concessions over oil lands belonging to the Roumanian State.5. All shares belonging to former enemy concessions which can be secured and all other advantages derived from these negotiations shall be divided, 50 per cent, to British interests and 50 per cent, to French interests. It is understood that in the company or companies to be formed to undertake the management and the exploitation of the said shares, concessions, and other advantages, the two countries shall have the same proportion of 50 per cent, in all capital subscribed, as well as in representatives on the board, and voting power.6. Territories of the Late Russian Empire. In the territories which belonged to the late Russian Empire, the two Governments will give their joint support to their respective nationals in their joint efforts to obtain petroleum concessions and facilities to export, and to arrange delivery of petroleum supplies.7. Mesopotamia, The British Government undertake to i^rant to the French Government or its nominee 25 per cent, of the net output of crude oil at current market rates which His Majesty&apos;s Government may secure from the Mesopotamian oilfields, in the event of their being developed by Government action.; or in the event of a private petroleum company being used to develop tthe Mesopotamian oilfields, the British Government will place at the disposal oi the French Government a share of 25 per cent, in such company. The price to be paid for such participation to be no more than that paid by any of the other participants to the said petroleum company. It is also understood that the said petroleum company shall be under permanent British control.8. It is agreed that, should the private.petrolum company be constituted as aforesaid, the native Government or other native interests shall be allowed, if they so desire, to participate up to a maximum of 20 per cent, of the share capital of the said company. The French shall contribute one-half of the first 10 per cent, of such native participation and the additional participation shall be provided by each participant in proportion to his holdings.Wt.-/P.d.49/91  F.O.P.   100  4/20  [3057]
9. The British Government agree to support arrangements by which the French Government may procure from the Anglo-Persian Company supplies of oil, which may be piped from Persia to the Mediterranean through any pipe-line which may have been constructed within the French mandated territory and in regard to which France has given special facilities, up to the extent of 25 per cent, df the oil so piped, on such terms and conditions, as may be mutually agreed between the French Government and the Anglo-Persian Company.10. In consideration of the above-mentioned arrangements, the French Government shall agree, if it is desired and as soon as application is made, to the construction of two separate pipe-lines and railways necessary for their construction and maintenance and for the transport of oil from Mesopotamia and Persia through French spheres of influence to a port or ports on the Eastern Mediterranean. The port or ports shall be chosen in agreement between the two Governments.11. Should such pipe-line and railways cross territory within a French sphere of influence, France undertakes to give every facility for the rights of crossing without any royalty or wayleaves on the oil transported. Nevertheless, compensation shall be payable to&apos;the landowners for the surface occupied.12. In the same way France will give facilities at the terminal port for the acquisition of the land necessary for. the erection of depots, railways, refineries, loading wharfs, &amp;c. Oil thus exported shall be exempt from export and transit dues. The material necessary for the construction of the pipe-lines, railways, refineries and Other equipment shall also be free from import duties and wayleaves.13. Should the said petroleum company desire to lay a pipe-line and a railway to the Persian Gulf, the British Government will use its good offices to secure similar facilities for that purpose.14. North Africa and other Colonies. The IVench Government will give facilities to any Franco-British group or groups of good standing, which furnish the necessary guarantees and comply with French laws, for the acquisition of oil concessions in the French colonies, protectorates and zones of influence, including Algeria, Tunis and Morocco. It should he noted that the French Parliament has resolved that groups so formed must contain at least 67 per cent. French interests.15. The French Government will facilitate the granting of any concessions in Algeria which are now under consideration as soon as the applicants have complied with all the requirements of the French laws.16. British Crown Colonies. In&apos;so far as existing regulations allow, the British Government will give to French subjects who may wish to prospect and exploit petroliferous lands in the Crown Colonies similar advantages to those which France is granting to British subjects in the French colonies.17. Nothing, in this agreement shall apply to concessions which may be the subject of negotiations initiated by French or British interests.18. This agreement had, to-day been initialled by M. Philippe Berthelot and Professor Sir John Cadman, subject to confirmation by the French and British Prime Ministers respectively.J. C. P. B.San Remo, April 24, 1920.Confirmed:I). L. G. A.
