This Document is the Property of 94His Britannic Majesty^ C . ornroettt.^\,A US T HA LAB I A N      MEAT.r?ma^^     REPORT BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.My Department resumed the control of the sale of. Australasian meat on the 15th MayeW    STOCKS,   The stock position as on the 15th June is shown in the attached schedule.   There will, of course, have to be added any further deliveries under the contracts, while it will be noted that there is to be subtracted 22,000 tons lamb sold for direct shipment from New Zealand, to North America.(2)    CONSUMPTION.    The first action taken to stimulate the consumption was a reduction in the wholesale prices under the authority of Minute Ae   (Note,   Maximum retail prices had already been removed at the request of the Board of Tradeh Instead of a flat wholesale price of 9d* per lbc, which had given great dissatisfaction to the retailers, prices were graded in accordance with the value of the meat, as followsNew Zealand^    Australian^ Cut Ewes 7d 6jdUncut Ewes 8d 7^dCut Wethers 8d 7^dUncut Wethers 9d 9dLambs remained as hitherto at 13d0 per lb. these reductions did not go to the full extent authorised by the Cabinet, but the returns of sales given below show that they were effective and secured increased consumption^ 1While the reduced price was undoubtedly responsible for a large measure of the increase, it was assisted by the fact that during June the home production of meat is at a low ebb- and an increased demand for imported meat is normal at that timec Considerable diminution in this demand must be expected during July, when the livestock which has been held &quot;back for the cessation
of control will come on the market.   The demand for imported meat is likely also to fall to a low level from the&apos;middle ofSeptember till the middle of November when the markets will be full of meat from the grass fed stocktSales of Imported Meat for consumption during April, May and June, 192oiWeek ended  Total sales Australasian AustralasianTons     Beef and Mutton American  Mutton and			and Lamb.

The offer put forward by the Ministry comprised an offer of some 21,000 tons of North American flour conditional upon the acceptance by the German Government of 10,000 tons of Chinese bacon and 5,000 tons of American bacon and 25,000 tons of Australasian mutton. The mutton was to be delivered in equal monthly shipments between August and
m     J     *&quot;December and the prices were to be ljd per lb above the wholesale prices at which the meat was being sold in England, to cover the cost of delivery to the ship and freight to Hamburg; The insurance was to be at the buyer-s risk and the Ministryfa risk was to cease when the meat was put on board   The terms of payment proposed were from 9-12 months1 credit from the dates of shipment with 6% interest and the re-payment was to be in sterlingsThese negotiations broke down; the grounds put forward by the German Government being twofold.-First;   That they had a difficulty in disposing of their present&quot;Large stocks of meat and fatn, and Secondly&apos;: That they were not in a position to buy moat of any kind even though conditions of payment were favourable *The first reason given is entirely at variance with full and detailed explanations made by Herr-Merz to me with regard to the meat position in Germany,;,   Ho inf ormed me that substantial*imports of meat are essential in the latter part of this year if Germany is- to maintain her present wholly inadequate ration.I believe that statement to be true, and that the real difficulty with tho German Government is the financial difficulty. I am hopeful that as a result of the Spa Conference some avenuo towards the resumption of those negotiations with Germany may be found.The increase in the consumption of Australasian mutton in this country since the 15th May has been considerably more than I had ventured to hope for0   The present rat* of consumption is more than double the consumption of Australasian mutton and lamb in this country before tho war; but even this rate of consumption is insufficient to solve the problem of how our great accumulations of mutton are to be disposed of in time to avoid grave inconvenience to the colonial producers, and much political friction when the producers will be clamouring for shipping and storage space for the forthcoming seasoncs outputs
About 3,000 tons has been disposed of to Austria and is in process of transport.    Arrangements have been made for a small quantity to be shipped direct from Australia to Sweden and small quantities are going&quot;almost weekly from this country to Prance. *(4).     DURATION^OF CONTRACTS.     The New Zealand contract termination-nates by agreement on 30th June,     Strong pressure was exercised for the extension of this date, but Lord miner cabled to the Governor General of New Zealand on 26th May that His Majesty&apos;s Governroen-t-ifere -unable to depart from the decision conveyed on 13th..March. that they were unable to extend the contract beyond 30 th. June.On -the-&quot;28th.jrune I discussed&quot;&quot;this- &quot;decision with Sir Thomas Mackenzie, representing the New Zealand Government. The result of the interview was intimated to the Undor-Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter of the same date in the following terms&quot;As a result of the interview, Sir Thomas Mackenzie was authorised f!to inform  his Government that the Food Controller was unable to &quot;sanction any extension of the present contract but that he &quot;sympathized very strongly with New Zealand producers in their &quot;difficulties and recognized the necessity of maintaining the &quot;United Kingdom as the principal market for New Zealand meat; that &quot;he was accordingly prepared to facilitate the resumption of&quot;private, trading at the earliest possible moment by the allocation.....:&quot;of some definite proportion of tonnage to private shippers subject &quot;only to such conditions as might be necessary to protect the &quot;realization of Government stocks which was now being pressed &quot;forward.very urgently.     I am to add that Sir  -Thomas Mackenzie &quot;expressed himself satisfied with this intimation/1Lord Milner also cabled on 26th May to the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia inviting the Australian States to assent to a definite date for the termination of those contracts,
m       5suggesting the 30th September, except in tho case of Queensland for which the 30th November was suggested.No reply appears to have been received as yet to this invitation.(&amp;).      PUBLICITYc   The Cabinet authorized a certain expenditure on advertising as a step that would assist in the disposal of the stocks entrusted to the Ministry6   After giving full consideration to the matter it was decided that better results were likely to be I achieved by advertising of a less direct nature than display advertisements in the newspapers which might endanger subsequent free publicity.   With this object the newspapers were furnished from time to time with paragraphs to controvert the impression that the Government stocks consisted of inferior meat*   At the same time the household columns of various papers were used to suggest to the public recipes for new ways of cooking mutton.The expenditure which has been incurred in this way has been trifling, but there would appear to be some justification for claiming that it has assisted sales.(6).      CONGESTION AT PORTS *    As regards delay in unloading meat ships which at one period resulted in heavy demurrage, I am glad to be able to report that there are at present no meat ships awaiting discharge and that there is vacant cold storage space in all the principal ports.(7).      As soon as the transfer was completed, I appointed a Meat     !(Sales) Committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, to decide upon the best means of stimulating increased sales at home and abroad, and to prepare the periodical report on progress for submission to the Cabinet.   I have received the great-est assistance from this Committee and.attribute the increased consumption largely to its excellent work.(Sgd)  CHARIES A. McCURDY.1st July, 1920.
