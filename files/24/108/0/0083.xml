4/  *^%fL^k. 308(MS DOOPMBIKT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S  OTERMENT).IS B 0 R E T.0 A   I H B I,S.P.-1580,BRITISH PQRCE AT MESHED.(Circulated for consideration, at, the request of the Secretary of State for War)........So. 453.D. 8 p.m. 4th July, 1920.(Very Urgent).R. 3.30 p.m. 5th July, 1920I have lately received large number of most dis-quieting reports regarding Bolshevik activities of various 6 kinds on both sides of frontier of Khorassan from which it appears probable that if British f oree at Meshea is withdrawn that province will quickly be overrun.Quite apart from injury which loss of so important a province would inflict on Persia and danger to India experienced by presence of Bolshevik forces in that region effect on political situation here would be extremely bad and perhaps even fatal. -I have finally succeeded in spite of evidence to the contrary which he believes to exist in convincing MushJP-ed-  -Dowleh that. His Majesty&quot;s Government are prepared to give him a fair trial and he has consented to take office very largely on that assumption.     If these troops are now with-drawn his belief in my assurances will be severely shaken and he will fear the first step is being taken to abandon Persia te her fate at moment of her most pressing need.   At worst he will then at once, resign; in that case crisis from which I hope country is at last recovering will recur in an even more acute and dangerous form and it will be difficult and perhaps even impossible to induce any other statesman to form Government,    Consequences of such a situation as affecting British policy&apos; in Persia have already been explained.
At beat position of-new GorernmenVi^ula^ke^ shaken and their prestige gravely impaired at the very outset of their career while task of initiating reforms and getting Anglo-Persian Agreement accepted by Parliament would become&apos; much mere difficult.I trust therefore that it may be found possible to keep force in question where it is at least till new Cabinet is firmly established, agreement has been accepted and country is in a better position to defend itself unaided.Addressed te Foreign Office.     Sent to India, Meshed, Baghdad and Ea^rdLnuWhitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 7th July, 1920o
