Referred to Committee of Home affairs this Document is the uronertv of H1b Brittanio IfaJestvVa.. Government..fTHE     CABINETMil of Mfflsito lej^^ffi fry, th.o Lag ftf fleer, s ,,of, ,the, Pr-owji,1. The Hone Affaire Committee of the War Cabinet at their54th Meeting on the 14th April, 1920 accepted the draft Indemnity Dill, prepared by the Interdepartmental Committee, and requested the Solicitor General with the assistance of the Rt.Kon,Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, to introduce the Bill into the House at the earliefit moment-    The Bill Was accordingly introduced on the 15th April 1920, and the second reading took place on the 3rd May,    The Bill was eeverely criticised from all quarters of the House;-   the criticisms being directed mainly to the following points:-(l) The exclusion of a right of appeal to ;the Courts of the Be aim,(2) The denial to a claimant of a right to compel the . tribunals to state a oaso on a point of lav- for the Opinion of the Courts.(0 )The validation of the principles of compensation which the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission had hitherto applied upon the alleged ground that such compensation was inadequate and unfair.   Special stress was laid upon the fact that the Commission had refused to g ve any compensation in casee where land or premises requisitioned by the Government were unoccupied at the date of the requisition, although they might be vacant as&apos; the result of conditions brought about by the war..
(4) The validation of Proclamations or Orders in Council made under the Customs - Consolidation Act which might toe issued at any time until the date cf the termination of the war. 2,, The Attorney General in summing up on behalf of theGovernment and in order to secure the second readin;, promised amendments on the following matters:-(a) A claimant should have the right to require the tribunal to state a ease for the opinion of the Court, and in the. event of the refusal of the tribunal ao to do,&apos; the claimant oould apply to the High Court of Justice for an afrder compelling the tribunal to state a case,,(b) That the Defence of the Realm Lorses Commission should be enlarged and reinforced by the addition of a veryconsiderable legal element..(c) That in cases where there would have been, but for the passing of the Indemnity Bill,, a legal right to compensation as distinct from an ex gratia claim before the Defence of the He aim Losses Commission,, the assessment fit compensation in the former case should be on a different basis from that in the latter case,, and the fact that a legal claim existed should be a matter to which regard should be had by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission in assessing the compensation payable.(d) That only those Proclamations and Orders in Council issued prior to the date of the introduction of the Dill should be validated under Section 40,3.,, Since the second reading of the Dill the House ofLords have given their decision in what is generally hnowii as the De Ifeys-er^s Hotel oase,,    The effect of this decision- is tV lay down the principle that where the Crown has requisitioned land or buildings for the purposes of the war, it must be taken to have
exorcised the requisition under the Statutory powers of t&quot;-,e Defence Act 1842, and. that compensation must be assessed in accordance with that Act.    The decision goes further in that it also laid down that - the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission had no jurisdiction to hoar or to deal with claims in respect of land and buildings since these cases oome within the class of cases which are excepted by the Royal Commission setting up the Defence of the Realm. Losses Commission, being &quot;otherwise provided for&quot;.    The combined effect of the decisions in the De Keyser&apos;s Eotel oase and the Newcastle Breweries oase is to give every person whose land or property including goods have been requisitioned for the purposes of the war a legal claim to compensation.      This does not apply to shipping.    In the case of land and buildings the claim would be under the Defence Act 1842, and in tv,e case of goods and stores it would be under Section 115 of the Army act as amended by the Army (Food, F&amp;rage and Stores) Act,1914 and subsequent amending Acts. 4, The amendments proposed to carry out the  attorney general&apos;s promise are.as follows i.-(l) Page If lines 19 and 20, Delete &quot;right to.compensation is ctnferred by&quot; and insert in lieu thereof &quot;claim for payment or compensation can be brought under&quot;.(2) Page 3S line 15 and 16, delete &quot;and substantial&quot;.(3) Clause 2, page 3, line 29, after &quot;proceedings&quot; insert &apos; &quot;and shall if so directed by the High Court or the Court of Session or a jud.se thereof&quot;,(4) Clause 2, page 4, line 1, after &quot;section&quot; insert &quot;save as hereinafter provided&quot;.(5) Clause 2, page 4, delete lines 20 - 20 inclusive and insert;&quot;(iii) In any other case compensation shall be assessed as follows:- , ,,.(a) If the claimant would, apart from, this Act, have had a legal right to compensation, the tribunal shall tal:e that right into consideration, and in. assessing the compensation shall have regard to t&apos;:e amount of the compensation tovjB&amp;*&apos;cb, apart from this Act:, the claimant would have been legally entitled and to the existence of a state of war? Provided that this subsection shall not give any   &apos; right to payment cr compensation for indireot loss.
.4. 37711 (b) If the claimant would not have had any sue&apos;&apos;1 right, the compensation shall he assessed in accordance with the principles upon which the Commission appointed by His Majesty under Commisslore dated the thirty first day of Karofe nineteen hundred and fifteen and eighteenth day of December nineteen hundred and eighteen (commonly known as the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission) has hitherto acted in oases There no speoial provision is made as to the assessment of compensation&quot; *(6) Page 4, between lines 37 and 3G insertJ-&quot;(w) A Judge of the High Court of Justice shall preside over the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, which Commission shall hereafter be styled and known as the War Compensation Court&quot;.(7) Page 5, line 16, after the word   &quot;war&quot; insert &quot; and before the fifteenth day of April nineteen hundred andtwenty&quot; .The effect of the amendments will be as follows:-(l) The first two amendments are formal and are neceRsary in order to make the clauses in which they are inserted conform to the provisions of the 5th and main amendment .(2 ) The third amendment will give a claimant the right torequire the tribunal to state any question of law arising during the hearing of his claim in the form of a special case for the opinion of the-i:,;h Court.   If the. tribunal refuses to state a case, the claimant will have t-:e right to apply to the Hi Ah Court for an order compellin; the tribunal to do so.(3) The fourth amendment will enable the tribunal in assessing tho compensation payable to take into account the faot that a claimant has a legal ri;&apos;:,ht to compensation.   It is in effect consequential upon the fifth amendment.(4) The fifth amendment is the substantive one and enables the tribunal where a claimant can establish that apart from this Act he would have had a, legal rifht to
compensation to take the fact of th:-; existence of that right into account in arriving at the Compensation payable.   It will not, however, necessarily compel the tribunal to pay the claimant the full measure of compensation to which he would have been legally entitled. The words at the end of (iii)(a) &quot;and to the existence cf a state of war&quot; being intended to give the tribunal the opportunity to reduce or increase as they may think fit, the legal measure of compensation to which a claimant mi-:;ht have been entitled^Notwithstanding the decision in the De Keyser&apos;s Hotel oase, the scope of the Bill is such as to ensure that a claim for condensation arising out of requisition of land, &quot;buildings or goods will be sent for decision to one of the tribunals which have hitherto dealt with these cases. This is in our opinion essential..If claimants were in a position to submit t^eir claims to various tribunals who would under the decisions referred to have seizing in these oases; namely a sheriff and a jury or an arbitrator under the Defence Act 1342 or County Court Judges under the Army Aot, different principles of compensation might be applied and confusion must result. &apos; It is more just and fair to all ooncerned that all claims for compensation arising out of the requisition of land, buildings and stores for the purposes of the war should be dealt witv by the same tribunals and if these tribunals are allowed to take into account tfce measure of compensation to which a person would have been legally entitled such person could have no just cause for complaint.
(4) The sixtb aiiiendment fulfils the Attorney general s promise to strengthen the tribunal by the addition of a considerable legal, element.    We fcre strongly of opinion that this amendment is most important and will disarm much of the criticism of the Bill,  The desire to be able to present oases to the Judge of the High Court is very strong and widespread*(5) The seventh amendment carries out the Attorney General&apos;s promise that no Proclamation or Order issued under the . Customs Consolidation Act shall be validated other than those issued prior to the fifteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and twenty, the date of the introduction of the Bill,6, It is impossible to give an accurate estimate of tireadditional cost to the Crown as the result of the decision in the De Keyser&apos;8 Hotel case and the proposed amendments to the Bill but provided the amendments are limited to cases cf claims for land and Wildings the Departments conoerned tire of the opinion that the additional cost should not exceed about 5 million pounds. If cases already (settled are to be re-opened this figure would he largely Increased,   An off ojtti hi li 3 t he made before the Select Committee to secure a recommendation on their part to this effect. But as the present amendments are intended to be confined to those necessary to carry out the undertakings given by the Attorney General and as suoh are to be published as a while paper it has been thought desirable not to include any other amendments.   Such other amendments could however be pressed before the Select Committee.       Tho amendments have been submitted to Sir Edward Carson 17I10 is satisfied with them.The matter is very urgent and the Cabinet is asked to glvq their. dflolBion without delay stating whether tho, proposed amendments axe accepted,*5*5^Q&apos;* B.M.P.NCTjj! ^ ecpy of the Bill sinewing the proposed amendments is attached hereto.
Indemnity Bill.MEMORANDUM.The object of this Bill is twofold: (1) The indemnification against the consequences of acts done in good faith, but in excess of authority or without jurisdiction, in carrying out duties in connexion with the prosecution of the war:(2) The validation of certain laws, ordinances and pro-clamations, and of sentences of military and other courts.The former is effected by clause 1 of the Bill. This clause protects officers and officials against the institution of proceedings against them where they have acted bona fide in the interest of the country.Irregularities have in some cases, owing to the stress of war, occurred in the constitution of courts-martial. The Bill, while protecting the officers in such cases, will not prevent the findings and sentences of the courts-martial being quashed if the irre-gularity was such as to make the proceedings legally voidable.The protection given by the clause extends to persons in the service of the Red Cross and similar societies acting under the authority of the military.There are several exceptions to- the generality of the clause: (1) Proceedings by the Crown:(2) Proceedings for breach of contract. The Bill does not affect remedies for breaches of contractual obligations, but a limit of one year within which the proceedings must be commenced is imposed:(3) Proceedings founded on negligence, except in foreign countries, which are dealt with under the next heading:(4) Proceedings for injury to person or property in any foreign country if the consent of the Attorney-General is obtained. Conventions have been concluded with Prance, Belgium and. Italy providing machinery for[Bill 73] a
ii Indemnity. [10 Geo. 5.]the settlement of claims for damage caused by thb British, troops in those countries. The intervention of the Attorney-General will prevent proceedings being instituted which are covered by the conventions:(5) Proceedings in respect of the validity or infringement of patents.The effect of clause 1 will he to take away any remedy by petition of right or other legal process in a court of law, vvhether pending or not yet commenced, in cases where property has been requisitioned or businesses interfered with. It is therefore necessary to provide some substitute.During the five years which have elapsed since it was set up, the Losses Commission has adjudicated in a vast number of cases on a basis of payment for direct and substantial loss, and under Regulation 2b and other regulations on the basis of cost plus reasonable profit. In shipping cases the Admiralty Arbitration Transport Board has settled claims for freight on the basis of the &quot;Blue Book Rates&quot; to an amount of 331,000,000/. and has refused to entertain claims for indirect or consequential loss.These bases of assessment have been generally accepted. A number of actions, however, have been instituted challenging their validity, and a further number of claims are awaiting the issue of events. It is essential that doubts which conflicting decisions of the Courts (e.g., the Newcastle Breweries case v. Rex, before Mr. Justice Salter, and the Hudson Bay Company v. Maclay, before Mr. Justice Greer) have created should be settled one way or the other by legislation.If the bases of assessment of compensation hitherto applied were rejected, and the cases dealt with without reference to the regulations, which were issued in order to restrict excessive profits entirely due to the abnormal conditions caused by the state of war, which created artificial market prices, it is estimated that the additional cost to the Exchequer would be not less than 700,000,000/.; of this amount more than 300,000,000/., it might even be 400,000,000/., would be payable in respect of British shipping, nearly the whole of which came under requisition and control. Ibr one commodity alone, rum, a comparatively insignificant item, an additional sum of 750,000/. would be payable.
The principle of payment on the basis of actual cost plus a normal rate of profit was adopted in contracts for munitions, buildings and many other supplies amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds in the aggregate.Clause 2, therefore, confirms the basis of assessment hitherto applied, but gives expressly a legal right to compensation.Proceedings in Prize Courts are exempted from the operations of the Bill by clause 3; clause 4s validates Proclamations and Orders in Council issued during the period of the war under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, prohibiting or restricting the importation of goods into the United Kingdom, and also licences granted in pursuance of any such Proclamations or Orders.Clause 5 validates sentences by military and special courts set up in occupied territories, and clause 6 validates laws, Ordinances and Proclamations in such territories.Clause 7 extends the provisions of the Bill to the whole of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, except the self-governing Dominions, who will pass their own legislation, subject to such modifica-tions by Order in Council as may be necessary to adapt it to the special circumstances of India and the Colonies.
