tary Secret.1371v?^/   IVom Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,hth May 1920.1651. Your telegram of 1st May, 5494. Force at Meshed is to be withdrawn forthwith, only consular escorts being retained, one and half cavalry squadrons at Meshed and hall: a squadron at Seistau with some light armoured cars and possibly Ford van transport at Meshed. Small regular mobile detachment to be kept at Duzdap, and reduced garrison at Kvvash. Khorasan and Seistan levies will be taken over by Persian. Strong objection by His Majesty&apos;s Government has been taken to the estimate of five months in which to effect withdrawal from Meshed, and I request that every effort be made to carry it out in less time, and that it be expedited to greatest possible extent. Please telegraph, after consideration, your revised estimate of quickest withdrawal possible. I will address you again regarding incidence of expenditure.
