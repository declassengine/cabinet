This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.?THE CABINET.FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY OF CADET ORGANIZATIONS.MEMORANDUMS THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a memorandum on the future of Cadet organizations.   The      9 Cadet movement is of great value to the nation, and its future depends largely on the   Cadets extent to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to grant financial assistance.    3969 As the value of Cadet organizations is admittedly social rather than military, it is the opinion of the War Office that their total cost should, not be borne entirely by Army funds, but should be shared by the Board of Education and the Home Office.w. s. c.30th April, 1920.The future of the Territorial Force Cadets was considered by an Inter-Departmental Conference (presided over by Sir Amherst Selby-Bigge, of the Board of Education), on 9th December, 1919, which passed resolutions to the following effect: (i.) The Cadet organization must be regarded as a valuable method for furthering the physical and moral development of boys on a national basis.(ii.) The responsibility for the administration of the Cadet movement should remain with the War Office,^ the existing limitations in regard to the number of units raised being removed.(iii.) For stimulating the movement locally, the assistance of local Juvenile Organization Committees and the local Education Authority should be obtained by the County Territorial Force Associations.(iv.) [a.) The Board of Education cannot ask the Treasury for a grant in aid of Cadet organizations, although it may be possible, under certain limitations, for local Education Authorities to give financial assistance under Section 17 of the Education Act, 1918.(b.) The existing War Office grants to Territorial Force Associations should be continued (but on a capitation basis), and in addition, a further capitation grant should be paid direct to the Cadet units.(c.) That as expenditure on the Cadets cannot be recommended as part of the Admiralty, the Air Force and the War Office expenditure for military purposes, the other Ministers concerned should be moved to join the Secretary of State for War and the other defence Ministers in approaching the Cabinet with a view to obtaining special grants to develop the Cadet movement, outside the sums allotted for the normal expenditure of the defence departments.The Army Council accept the above resolutions in general terms. But they felt that whilst of importance as a recruiting ground to the Territorial Force the chief value of the Cadet movement is in its social aspects, and considers that the Home Office and the Board of Education should together contribute two-thirds of the cost.Under existing regulations Territorial Force Associations receive for each company of from 30 to 100 Cadets, 5/., for administration and other purposes, which may not be paid over as a capitation grant to the Cadet units, the assumption being that Cadet units are self-supporting.* With the Admiralty and the Air Ministry for the Cadets of these departments. (B20/150)   100  4/20   H&amp;S   8068\vo
2It is now proposed that (i.) The Territorial Force Associations should receive a capitation grant ofIs. for each efficient Cadet for cost of administration, &amp;c. (ii.) An. additional capitation grant of 5s. for each efficient Cadet shall be paiddirect to Cadet units, (iii.) Direct financial assistance should be further supplemented by indirect help from the defence departments, in the matter of unserviceable arms,camp, equipment, &amp;c.With the Cadets at their present strength of 120,000 proposals (i) and (ii) will involve an annual sum of 33,600/.; this sum will increase with the number of Cadets when the present restrictions are removed regarding the number of companies which may be recognised.It is not possible to estimate the cost of indirect forms of assistance which it is proposed to give, and further consideration of details will be necessary./
