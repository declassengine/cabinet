C.P.-1259. .CABINET.INTER-ALLIED AND ANGLO-AMERICAN DEBTS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering a Memorandum by theController of Finance.(See also CP. Papers 584, 597, 621, 842, 1093, 1153, 1156, and 1202.)I CIRCULATE a Memorandum prepared by the Controller of Finance in pursuance of my directions. I trust that my colleagues will find time to study this very important paper, and 1 beg for an early decision upon it.I have changed my mind on this question in consequence mainly of the intolerable pretensions of the United States Government. I told Mr. Rath bone privately, and, as one individual speaking to another, that I would sooner pay if I could, and default if I could not, than sell my country into bondage by signing any document containing language like that quoted from his draft by Mr. Blackett.I am now in favour: 1. Of releasing our Allies from their debts to us after setting off anything due by us to them.2. Of similarly releasing the Dominions if they desire it.This, in fact, is a gift to Australia only, and the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies is invited as to the best course for us to pursue.3. Of informing the United States Government of our intention in this respect, and at the same time of our intention to provide back interest, interest and sinking fund on our debt to them on the lines suggested by the Controller.(Initialled)        A. C.Treasury, S.W.,May 12, 1920.British Governments Debt to the United States Government.1. For more than a year negotiations have been in progress between the British and United States Treasury in regard to (1.) Postponement of interest and funding of principal of the British Governments debt to the United States Government, which is at present represented by demand obligations (on which interest has been paid up to the 15th April, 1919, and in some part up to the 15th May, 1919).(2.) The policy to be pursued by the British and American Governments towards the Allied Governments who are debtors to both.2. In the autumn of 1919 it seemed that the two Governments had reached an agreement in principle which only required to be worked out in detail on the following lines: (a.) Interest on all inter-Governmental obligations, including the British Govern-ment&apos;s debt to the United States Government, and the debts of other Governments to the British and United States Governments, to be postponed, without compound interest, for three years from April 1919 to April 1922.[3210] B
(b) The accumulated interest accrued during those three years to be paid of! in half-yearly instalments spread over ten or twelve years from 1922, in addition to the-regular payments of interest and to a small addition for Sinking Fund.(c.) The principal both of the British Governments debt to the United States Government and of the Allied Governments&apos; debts to the British and United States Governments to be consolidated into long-term obligations maturing partly in 1938 and partly in 1947.The details included in the above were more or less fixed by the fact that the United States Treasury are bound to adhere closely to the statutory provisions of the Liberty Loan Acts, and cannot hope to get fresh powers from Congress.The necessity for dealing at once with the problem of converting the demand obligations held by the United States Government into long-term bonds was based on the alleged inability of the United States Treasury to allow postponement of interest except as a part of the operation of conversion specifically authorised by statute.At one time Congress questioned the legality of such postponement altogether, but they have since admitted the Secretary of the Treasury&apos;s right to postpone interest, provided that it is regarded as a condition of conversion.The British Government acquiesced generally in this programme, after stating formally that they would have preferred a more far-reaching solution of the problem of inter-Allied debts.3. Since last autumn several attempts have been made to effect progress, and a considerable amount of detailed work has been done and several particular difficulties have been cleared out of the way. But each time new difficulties have appeared, and it has become evident that there is a serious divergence of opinion between the British and American Treasuries. The British Government regard these debts, whether from its standpoint as creditor or from its standpoint as debtor, as an obstacle to good relations, and wish to reach a comprehensive settlement as soon as possible. The United States Government regard the fact that it holds a large amount of demand obligations of the British and Allied Governments as a useful instrument for securing the acceptance of its point of view in any controversy which may arise out of the Peace Treaties or the general Eu o can situation.4. Further, it transpired (this was the result of Congress enquiring why the United States should forego interest at all, and more particularly interest due by the British Government) that--(a.) The United States Treasury was not prepared to forgo interest unless it received a specific request from each of the debtor Governments couched in more or less pleading terms and basing the demand for postponement on inability to pay, later modified in the case of Great Britain to inconvenience in making early payment.(6.) The United States Treasury was not in fact ready to give to tke British debt the same concessions as in the case of the other Allied debts, and wished to postpone interest on British debt not for a definite period, but only for so long as exchange is below par.       *5. The attitude of the United States Treasury in these matters may be illustrated by the following extracts from the draft of the documents prepared by Mr. Rathbone, Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury, in which he has attempted to give formal shape to the tentative agreement. (It should be explained that this document was submitted as a first draft for informal elaboration, and is not anything but an informal and tentative draft) :-Extract 1.-&quot;In making the foregoing tentative arrangements for the exchange of the above-mentioned demand obligations of the British Government into obligations having a fixed date of maturity, the Secretary of the Treasury has desired to aid in the stabilisation and rehabilitation of the financial and economic conditions of Europe. His willingness to accord liberal terms (such as postponement of interest payments for a three-year period, spreading the time fixed for repayment of deferred interest over a considerable period, fixing as the dates of maturity the latest dates permitted by statute, &amp;c.) to the Governments whose demand obligations are held by the United States is conditioned on reparation matters under. treaties with enemy and ex-enemy countries, and other questions involving the financial and economic stability of the world
being arranged so that in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury the aforesaid purposes may be realised. It is the view of the Secretary of the Treasury that, in order to accomplish such purposes, preferential tariffs and discriminating concessions must be avoided, and that each Government should refrain from granting to other Governments, or from asking or accepting from other Govern-ments, any such tariffs or concessions. Accordingly, no exchange of obligations as contemplated will be actually made and concluded unless and until determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Nevertheless, until such exchange is effected, or until the Secretary of the Treasury has given notice that he is not willing to conclude the arrangement for such exchange, neither the principal nor the interest will be demanded on the aforementioned demand obligations of the British Government contemplated to be exchanged as above provided, except only to the extent that such principal or interest would be payable under the terms of the obligations for which it is now contemplated that the same shall be eventually exchanged.&quot;Extract 2. &quot; The deferred interest aggregating 15 per cent, of the principal shall become due and payable as follows : f per cent, on the 15th October, 1922, and so on in small instalments up to the 15th April, 1934, provided, however, that if for any calendar week prior to the payment of all the said instalments of deferred interest the average cable buying rate per sterling in New York shall equal or be in excess of 4&quot;84 dollars, then there shall become due and payable on the loth day of the next succeeding calendar month the total amount remaining unpaid of the deferred interest . . . .&quot; &amp;c.6. Mr. Rathbone has agreed to modify and even to eliminate the objectionable features in the first of the above quotations, but it remains true that he is unwilling, and, indeed, unable, to commit the United States Government to make a final settle-ment without reserving its power to use its holding of Allied obligations in terrorem.7. As regards the question of deferred interest, the United States Treasury makes it quite clear that any concessions it may make as to postponement of interest and conversion into long-term bonds will be based solely on its judgment of the debtors capacity to pay, and that it has no intention whatever of doing anything as regards the British debt except to exact payment in full as early as may be.8. The matter is made even more difficult for the British Government in that it is the expressed desire of the United States Treasury that the British Treasury should hind itself so treat France, Italy, &amp;.c, on the same lines as the United States Treasury proposes to treat Britain, France, and Italy, that is, on the one hand the British Government is asked to use the debts owed to it by France and Italy as potential weapons for forcing those countries to adopt the British (and American) standpoint, and on the other hand the British Treasury is asked to bind itself formally to make payments on account of interest and principle to the United States Treasury on definite dates, and at the same time not to exact payment of interest and principal from France and Italy except pari passu with payments made by them to the United States Treasury.9. The desire of the United States Treasury that the British and United States Governments should come to an agreement as to the treatment to be accorded to their common debtors is a natural one. But hitherto it has meant simply that the British Government has subordinated its views of how to deal with the problem to those of the United States Treasury-or rather to those which the United States Treasury feels strong enough to defend before the United States Congress. If the British Government is prepared to give up the attempt to co-operate in this matter with the United States Government, and to inform the latter that it is at liberty to make what terms it thinks fit with France, Italy, &amp;c, and that the British Government proposes to deal with the debts owed to it by those countries on its own lines, indicating that, those lines will be more liberal than the United States proposes, it will then be possible to separate this problem of the Allied debts from the particular problem of Britains debt to. the United States Government.10. It is submitted that the inconveniences of attempting to reach a joint policy with the United States Government regarding the Allied Governments&apos; debts are so great as to justify the British Government in taking its own course, and that, as the advantages offered by the United Stages Treasury in regard to postponement oiinterest on the British Governments debt are negligible under the terms now suggested, it is not worth while to negotiate further as regards such postponement and that effort should now be concentrated first on paying up the deferred interest accrued to date[32101 B2
(about 210,000,000 dollars), then on paying interest as it accrues half-yearly (about 100,000,000 dollars each half-year), and finally in providing for paying of the principal (4,213,000,000 dollars) as quickly as is reasonably practicable.11. Our financial position in regard to payments in the United States of America may be summarised as follows : Since the 1st January, 1920, we have paid off, in the United      Dollars. States of America and Canada, debt to the amount of nearly ...   100,000,000We have provided for the purpose of paying off a debt to the Argentine Government on the 15th May a sum of ...    50,000,000We propose to pay off in July dollar Treasury bills held by the Japanese Government to a total of     ... ... ...    15,000,000And we have bought Anglo-French bonds to the nominal value of       ...        ...        ...         ... ...        ...   100,000,000Total     ...        ...... 265,000,000Our present balances in the United States together with resources actually in sight are sutlicient, in addition to dealing with the above items so far not already dealt with, to pay offthe balance of the British share of the Anglo-French loan, viz. 150,000,000and still leave us a small balance over.415,000,000This leaves out of account a sum of from 30,000,000 to 50,000,000 dollars due to be paid to us by the United States Government in respect of claims of the War Office, Ministry of Munitions, and Ministry of Shipping, and finally we have a sum of 22,000,000L in gold (originally set aside against a contingent claim by Italy) which we had contemplated drawing on for purposes of the Anglo-French loan, but have not in fact needed.We have had no difficulty over and above providing these sums for debts in meeting all our current requirements for wheat, &amp;c, over exchange. No credit is taken in the above figures for 30,000,000 dollars of the three and ten-year British Government notes issued in November 1919, which we had to buy to support the market and still bold.12. Apart from our liabilities to the United States Government, the other debt in North America, which we have to take into consideration for present purposes, consists of (1.) 129,000,000 dollars British Government five-year 5-1 per Cent. Bonds maturing November 1921.(2.) 100,000,000 dollars British Government three-year convertible notes maturing November 1922.(3.) 150,000,000 dollars debt due to Canadian banks.(4.) About 150,000,000 dollars debt due to Canadian Government.(5.) 250,000,000 dollars French share of Anglo-French loan.13. Of these (1.) The first will probably have to be paid off, though by 1921 it may be possible to issue another British Government loan in New York.(2.) The second is convertible into ten-year National War Bonds at 4 dol. 30 c, and may to a large extent be so converted before maturity.(3) and (4.) We ought to provide not less than 50,000,000 dollars towards paying off Canada between November 1920 and March 1922, but need not, I think, be seriously concerned about these.(5.) The French share of the Anglo-French loan is a continual nightmare, but it is hard to believe that in the end the French will refuse to deal with this. M. Marsal has explicitly undertaken that coute que coute France will meet its share of this debt at maturity.
14. The programme outlined above therefore involves finding between now and about May 1922-i,e., at the rate of 415,000,000 dollars a year.Thereafter we should require 200,000,000 dollars a year for interest to the United States Government, less reduced amount resulting from any repayments elfected.We need not seriously consider the necessity of finding any large amount before the 1st November, 1920, and we may safely say that we have in sight by that date at least 50,000,000 dollars plus a sum of 22,000,0001 in gold, without either buying more exchange or trenching on published figures of gold reserves.Judging by recent experiences, it should not be difficult to buy a further 50,000,000 dollars of exchange in the next two or three months without materially affecting the rate.Considering the comparative ease with which we have dealt with over 400,000,000 dollars of dollar debt in the first few months of 1920 (besides dealing with not inconsiderable amounts of debt in Japan and elsewhere during the same period) the programme outlined does not appear to be undnly burdensome.For interest to United States Government  Accrued to date, one year   ... Two further vears ...For principal of other debt (say) ...210,000,000 420,000,000 200,000,000Dollars.830,000)B. P. B.May 11, 1920.
