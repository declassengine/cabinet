This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Jury Lists Bill.i to memorandum.Before 1918 the jury lists were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Juries Act, 1825, and the Juries Act,In 1918 power was given by s. 6 of the Juries Act of that year to modify by Order in Council the provisions of the Acts of 1825 and 1862 for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary expense and labour in the preparation of the lists, and also with respect to the place and manner of publication. The Act of 1918 will expire six. months after the end of the war, and this Bill is intended to take its place.Clause 1 (1) (a) will secure a great saving in labour and expense by enabling such provisions of the old Acts as require the occupation and rating qualification of each juror to be specified in the lists to be superseded, and the simple method of publication adopted under the Act of 1918 to be continued.Clause 1 (1) (c) will enable the statutory form of precept, the use of which is obligatory under section 4 of the Juries Act, 1862, to be varied from time to time as may be required. Many of the provisions of the statutory form have long been obsolete.Section 5 of the Juries Act, 1918, temporarily raised the age limit of jurors from 60 to 65. The Bill proposes to repeal it as from 31st December next. Jurors over 60 who are now on the lists will of course remain liable to be summoned till the end of the year; but persons over that age will not be placed upon the new lists.1862.120-3
