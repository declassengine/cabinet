,(P 3462) From Viceroy, 30/// April 1.920.(Received 5 pan.)Clear the line.522 S. My telegram dated 2(Jth April, 403 S. Mussoorie Conference. Dobbs reports that on 24th April, after Sir Abdul Qaiyiun had delivered his message suspending discussions until frontier incidents are explained and adjusted, Mahmud Tarsi directed Ghulain Muhammed, his colleague, to state briefly to Abdul Qaiyum in blunt Afghan fashion, objects with which the Afghan delegates had come to India. Ghulam Muhammecl then spoke as followsThese longed-for discussions are useless. Facts are these ;. We can still make arrangements with Bolsheviks, but we prefer to turn first to Great Britain, partly because she is our old friend, and partly because she is an ancient, powerful, and well-established State, which the Bolsheviks are not, and because she is wealthy. We can quite easily get rid of our connection with the Bolsheviks and restrain Indian seditionists if it is made worth while. But we want to know how much the British will give. We desire to have Waziristan made over to us, as we control tribesmen, and until that is clone there will be constant trouble on the frontier, and we are sure the British must be tired of trying to manage tribesmen. Moreover, they rose to help us in the war and we are now accused of deserting them. If you repeat this statement to Mr. Dobbs he will have our object in a nutshell, and no further conversations will be needed.&quot;Since discussions were suspended, Mahmud Tarsi has had telegrams both from the Amir and Nadir Khan, the first being in cypher. Amir denied all knowledge of Chaman incident, and asserted that he had ordered no advance of troops and no advance had taken place beyond Afghan boundary. He directed Tarsi to suggest to us that instead of mean accusations, substantial proofs of our friendship should be given, and added that Tarsi, if he thought it necessary, might &quot;order Nadir Khan to blow softly.&quot; Nadir Khan lias telegraphed to Tarsi openly that during peace time no advance has been made by the Afghans on the Peiwar or in Ohitral, and that locality regarding which complaint, has been made, were in possession of Afghans during the war and before conclusion of peace. He has explained in a secret messagelhat Lambabat is part of Arnawai tract which was taken possession of during the war. Tarsi has in consequence of these messages written to Dobbs that no advance has been made, that incidents complained of are merely tribal incursions, and that Afghanistan will do nothing to forfeit friendship of Great Britain. Afghan contention apparently is that because their troops occupied Tandisar Spur and Arnwai or Arandu during the war they are entitled to re-occupy them now. They thus ignore clause in the Rawalpindi Treaty recognising the former frontiers. It is true that portion of Arnawai, on left bank of the Arnawai Stream, called the Dopalim, has been in the occupation of the Afghans since 1912, as boundary at this precise point was left somewhat undefined, vide note on map attached to Udny&apos;s agreement of April 1895, but this cannot conceivably give the Afghans any claim to Lambabat. Meanwhile, the Afghan force of mixed regulars and irregulars has advanced to ridge overlooking Darner Nisar, some 14 miles upstream from Arandu. Tower of Lambabat reported burnt, and 50 Chitral bodyguard who held it retreated. Officer Commanding, Chitral, and Assistant Political Agent have, as already reported, been instructed to expel Afghan&apos; forces by use of Indian Regulars, Chitrali Scouts, and bodyguard as most convenient. No action being taken yet to expel Afghan troops from Tandisar. Dobbs left for Mussoorie 29th April, and will see Mahmud Tarsi 1st May, and inform him first that we must insist on withdrawal of Afghan troops from Chitral territory and Tandisar, and that discussions can only proceed when this has been done. In connection with this he will expose fallacy of arguments by which Afghans attempt to justify occupation.Secondly. If Afghans comply with our demands for withdrawal, Dobbs will point out to Mahmud Tarsi that conference was agreed to for the purpose of discussing misunderstandings, and that wisest course would be to discuss all matters on which we may either agree or disagree before conference breaks up. Possibly Tarsi may reply.to this that fulfilment of Afghan demands regarding cessation of Waziristan operations is condition precedent to resumption of discussions. If he insists on this there is no more to be said, and delegation must return to Afghanistan. If, however, this difficulty can be overcome, and discussions continue, we feel strongly that since Afghans have to some extent forced our hands by blunt statement of their demands, we ought to be empowered now. to make in our turn definite preliminary
2declaration of what we are prepared to offer as groundwork for subsequent negotiations for treaty of friendship. Failing such definite declaration, present attitude of Afghans makes it probable that they will return to Kabul in very unfriendly frame of mind, and that we shall again move in vicious circles. Even ill Afghan dissatisfaction does not cause them to declare Avar, which we believe they are anxious to avoid, they will certainly continue to incite the tribes against us, and this will produce almost intolerable state of tension along the frontier involving us in military defensive measures hardly less serious and expensive, while possibly more prolonged, than actual war. In such an event war could hardly in the end be avoided. Both for financial and political reasons we ought to take every reasonable step to avoid such a contingency. We would, therefore, now ask most earnestly that, in addition to concessions already sanctioned by you, you will re-consider the question of recognition of title of His Majesty, vide point 4 of our telegram 53 C. of 12th April. Secondly. That you will authorise us to inform the Afghan delegates definitely that in the event of negotiations for treaty of friendship taking place as sequel to present conference, we should be prepared to grant Afghanistan same subsidy as that enjoyed by Habibulla (exclusive of two lakhs of rupees specially granted to him in 1915), namely, 18 lakhs of rupees, in return for really neighbourly conduct, including cessation of intrigues with tribes, denial of Afghan territory to hostile influence as focus of anti-British intrigues, and abstention from encouragement of anti-British, agitation in India. We trust that you may be able to let us have your instructions at very early date by clear line telegram.
