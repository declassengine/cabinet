3 DOOJireJT 13 tHE PROPERTY0? TUG 3RITAICIIIC IC/&amp;TFSnY1 S feVTOTO^T,)SECRET.CABII^T.C P, 1242.MURAL DECORATION OF THE FOREIGF OFF I GUIKer;Qrandura by theJ?irctjCommissionpr of Works. (Previous Papers CP&apos;s. 630 &amp; 1221)I should like to make a few observations on Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum in reply to mine of the 13th Februaryr (CP.1221). On some of tho main points at issue there appears tc be agreement.mural frescoes at his own expense was accepted by Lord Boa a champof the Cabinet was procured.Lord Curzon goes on to say that bo does nob profess to be an art expert but this does not prevent him launching in So a long and destructive criticism regarding the works of art in question and. his reasons for disliking them.     He also mentions a number of art cvritics and other persons to whom he has shown one panol (not properly fixed) out of a s oh erne of decoration in th* Foreign Office, who have expressed their dislike to it.    I do not profess to set upae an expert art critic, nor is that inv question which I have set forth in my TC&quot;morandum.   I know eminent artists both foreign and British and oth^r competent persons who have expressed greet admiration for the works in question and I have no doubt, fror my pretty extensive experience.of art critics and exports that any number of friendly and hostile opinions aan be. obtained.     But surely the time when that should hove been considered *yas in 1914 when the. commission ^as accepted on behalf 0^ the Cabinet byLord Beauchamp.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs endeavours to refute the case I -orosont^d as one of principle by r^fftrnnoc to d letter which Lord 3.^ui champ&apos;1958-59 to on ray 13th, 1914 in which lord Cur son admits that ilr.Goetzc.&apos;s offer to execute a series of on behalf of the Government of the day in 1914 and that the consentthe
the Artist is informed that a snail committee will probably be appointed to consider matters of detail and questions of international character, but not to judge, in any way, of the work as a work of art.     But no such committee ras appointed, and it is surely not the fault of the Artist that he was allowed to n;o on working all these years and soend a larve amount of money on the strength of a promise by a Minister of State on behalf of the Government of the day.     I quite agree that the acceptance of a gift like this, without any further conditions, by the Government in 1914; may have been foolish or unwise,&quot;and if Lord Curzon had been a member of that Cabinet he would no doubt have used his great influence to make the work subject at that time to a Committee to be mutually agreed upon; &apos; bi.it what I have pointed out and what I would repeat is this&apos;, that as this was not done, unless there is to be a deliberate breach of faith with. theArtist in question which must reflect seriously on all relations of the Government In future with any artist, he cannot possibly be now compelled to accept a committee nominated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Lord Curzon states that the Office of Works Is only concerned because a previous First Commissioner was responsible for the original negotiations and because my Denartmant was concerned in carrying out alterations in Government Buildings3 but that is not a. full statement of the case.     The First Commissioner has usually been responsible for a considerable amount of artistic work on behalf of the Government, such as, for instance, -sanctioning the erection of statues and giving commissions for the execution of Government work.   If it is open to any other Minister, who Is merely a temporary occupant of a Government Building, to veto decisions previously arrived at,- I do not see how any artist of merit could be expected to Undertake Government work0Vith/
with r gard to tho question of tho Committoo which Lord Curzon wisher, to sot up and on which he corresponded with tho Artist without communicating with no in any way, I quite agree with Lord Curzon that such a Committee ought to ha**o boon sot up at a much earlier stage, and, if this had been done, none of the difficulties which arise now would ha^e occurred.   I do not propose to enter into the question of the merits of tho particular Committoo which Lord Curzon suggests for tho reasons already stated, but, as regards his suggestions I would say:-(1)     It does not appear to me reasonable that a series of decorations, designed for one place and dealing with subjects specially selected with regard to their suitability for one building, should be transferred to another for which they were not designed and with which they ha^o no connection. Anyone who has.seen the fresconc, whatever he may think about them, must realise that the subjects ha-e no relation to a municipal building.(2)    As regards the proposal that all the frescoes should be provisionally hung in the Foreign Office before a final decision is taken, the effect produced would of course not be the same as if they were finally fixed,(3)     I ha^e already stated my reasons why I thinktit is not open now to raise the question of an expert Committee.   If the Cabinet decide in favour of such a Committee I might say that Lord Beauchamp has informed me that he would bo quite ready to sor-o on such a. Committee, as he was originally responsible, and Icertainlyr-rthink
think that a Committee ought neither to consist purely of Museum Directors or purely of artists *ALFRED MOHl),II,M. Office of Workso 6th May , 1920*
