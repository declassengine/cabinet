I circulate a Memorandum&apos; by the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Naval staff dealing with Gas war^-fare, and I am anxious to say on behalf of the Admiralty that we are in entire agreement with the views put foTvmxd by the War Office, which find confirmation and support in the Memorandum which I am now circulating.^ -    ..... . .....      .  &apos;       .....        . ,    -        &apos; ......... &apos; ..........    .......I am convinced that if we fail to keep ourselvesabreast of the times in all these modern developments, when the day comes to embark upon another war we shall&apos;again be found deficient.I hope that this question will receive thevery early consideration of the Cabinet,(Intld.) rlv Ho L, 8, V, 20o
ssm. &apos;   20GAS WARFARE.HnMUUlM *t&quot;**l&apos;BII *U W WWW. MlMemorandum for-the Cabinet by the First Sea Lord,9iMri&apos;&quot;rMrik *********:*rww**r     .w*Wtw ^irww^wsii w. jfr*fi*iwni,mt*Ky.*BP^^I have given ray consideration to Secret Memorandum of the 3rd May* 1920, on Gas Warfare, from the Secretary of State for War to the Cabinet (0oP*i211) enclosing a memorandum on the same sublet dated the 16th Anrilj 1920, from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,I am in complete agreement with the gist of both the above Memoranda., which I consider to be equally applivable to the Navy,2e*-   It is impossible any longer to ignore the fact that the U,S0 Representatives at the Peace Conference having inoculated Europe with the idea of a League of Hations, have since approved the adoption in practice of an entirely opposite doctrine, viz: thorough andvast preparations, for.....War.   Uiormous expenditure has been sanctioned for the purpose after complete discussion in public and in Congress0   The consequential result is that they are rapidly attaining an overwhelming position as a Fighting Pov/er9 as compared with nations of the European Continent, who have accepted the principles they have propounded,,3.-   From information  available, it appears clearly established that the United States has already adopted a lethal filling as a proportion of the burster for their turret armour piercing shells4*-    The ships of the Navy have not had actual experience of gas shell bursting on board, but it has been obvious from the experience of shins hit by shell that a percentage of gas ingredient in  he burster of a shell will greatly enhance its effect by preventing repairs and forcing personnel to wear gas apparatus at all times, which, in a ship., has a considerable effect on efficiency. The removal of persistent lethal and other gases from the compartments of a ship may also prove a most difficult tasio5*-    The Officers and men manning the ships of our Fleet must, therefore^ be equipped with efficient anti-gas apparatus, and in order to decide on the type, considerable and continual research must be carried out in connection with Gas and its antidotes^The Fleet was equipped in 1916 with anti-gas apparatusi and this has since been improved;   but all progress is now at a standstill and existi ng apparatus is rapidly deteriorating and becoming useless.I a-m strongly of opinion that Gas mpst be developed as a Naval weapon of offence*Possibly only the seaman can fully appreciate the relative position in action of two ships, in one of which the crew have to be clothed in heavy anti-gas clothing, while the other need not do so on account of the neglect of their opponent to arm himself with the gas weapon^During
During the War, experiments with 4&quot; Naval gas shell were carried out, and it was the intention to use them eventually against enemy submarines, but these were never issued, and have since been disposed ofcGas filling was not introduced into our Turret armour piercing shell, as in the light of knowledge of 1917 and 1918 it was deemed desirable to develop the full explosive force of the small bursters of these sMLLRecent fragmentation trials have, however, shewn that possibly a proportion of lethal or other Gas producing substances could be included in the bursters of these shell, a,nd could certainly be used in some other types of shell.6B-    At the present time the Navy, however, possesses no gas experimental or research establishment or factory for gas or anti-gas apparatus^7.-   By failing to give the Admiralty complete discretion and financial support to experiment in and develop the Art of Gas Warfare as applied to Naval operations, the Government is placing the Navy in a position of grave disadvantage.  When, as surely must occur, the Government realises that we cannot follow a road of our own in this matter, only the most gigantic and extravagant efforts will enable us to recover the position we shall have lost in our years of hesitation^8C-   I desire, - therefore,, to associate myself entirely with the proposals contained in paragraph 6 of the above quoted Memorandum of the Chief of the Imperial General staff.(Signed) &apos;   .A. of Fc 7,50 SO.
