The gabinet appointed a Oommittoe (Cabinet 25 (20-) Conclusion 7)   to review the building programme included in tho estimates of tho Office of Works on behalf of various Government Departments in order to decide in all doubtful cases whether building should bo permitted to proceed or not in view of the shortage of the labour required for the Ministry of Health&apos;s housing achomes.In the course of the Committeo!s enquiry it has boon disclosed that building by tho Admiralty,. War Office and Air Ministry is hinder the control cf the Office of Works, and s^ does not come within the roforenoe to the Committee. I am informed that building operations on a considerable scale are contemplated by these throe Departments, and&apos; I therefore ask whether tho reference to tho Commit-too should be extended to include them.(Signed)     L, WORTHINGTON EVANS,Copy Ho.
