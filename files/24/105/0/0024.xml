This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.secret.Referred to Committee of Home Affairs,THE CABINET.DEFENCE OP THE REALM (ACQUISITION OF LAND) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. In accordance with the decision of the Committee of Home Affairs at their 53rd Gen. No 8 Meeting on 23rd March last, I have reconsidered this Bill with a view to the     ^ preparation of a new draft restricted in scope and with a title more closely drawn than that of the existing draft Bill. /(2 &apos; B$ U-J2. Parliamentary Counsel has been again consulted and advises that, inasmuch as the Bill as at present drafted consists of a number of unrelated amendments of the Act of 1916, any other amendments of this Act would be within the scope of the Bill, and that it would not be possible by any alteration in the title of the Bill to shut them out. He is of opinion, however, that if the Bill is limited to the first two clauses and entitled &quot; Bill to amend the provisions of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition ol Land) Act, 1916, relating to the disposal of land which has been acquired under that Act,&quot; the scope of the Bill as well as the title will be limited to that one subject, and any amendment outside that limited scope would be out of order3. The Army Council attach considerable importance to Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the draft Bill, and more especially to Clause 5, as it will be impossible, as explained in my Memorandum of the 12th ultimo (CP. 854), to provide under the ordinary peace procedure for the continued validity of the bye-laws made under Defence of the Realm Regulation, No. 17, before 31st August next, when that regulation is due to expire.But, nevertheless, in view of the Committee&apos;s decision that the Bill should be reconsidered &quot; with a view to the preparation of a new draft restricted in scope and with a title much more closely drawn,&quot; and of the opinion of Parliamentary Counsel quoted in the preceding paragraph, they have reluctantly come to the conclusion that in order to safeguard Clauses 1 and 2 which they regard as the most essential portion of the Bill Clauses 3, 4 and 5 should be dropped.4. In the amended draft copy of the Bill, which is attached as an appendix to this Memorandum, these clauses have accordingly been deleted. In addition, Clause 1 has been revised as, although Parliamentary Counsel is satisfied that this clause as previously drafted would have been effective in the case of land situated in England, Wales or Ireland, it was doubtful whether it would have had any effect in the case of land situated in Scotland, owing to the fact that by Section 15 of the principal Act, it was provided thac Sub-Section (2) of Section 5 of that Act should not apply to Scotland. The clause as re-drafted gives express power to sell free from restrictive covenants.Clause 2, which deals with the right of pre-emption, is unaltered. 5. I submit the Bill, which in its amended form represents the bare minimum of the War Office requirements, for the early approval of the Cabinet.W. S.
