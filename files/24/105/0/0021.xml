Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.WivAL DECORATION Ob&quot; THE FOREIGN OFFICE.^      Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I APOLOGISE for my delay in replying to the Memorandum of the First Commissioner of Works of the 13th February last, concerning the frescoes painted by Mr. Sigismund Goetze for the Staircase of the Foreign Office? The overwhelming work which I have had to do in connection with the Inter-Allied Conferences of the past three months must be my excuse.The matter in dispute is not in reality one, as Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s Note appears to suggest, between the Office of Works and myself. The Office of Works is only concerned because a previous First Commissioner, Lord Beauchamp, was responsible for the original negotiations with Mr. Goetze and for the acceptance of his offer, and because it is the Department concerned with carrying out alterations in Government buildings. A much wider issue is involved, raising questions of principle as well as of expediency, upon which it is desirable that the Cabinet should pronounce.Sir Alfred Mond has narrated the early history of this affair. Mr. Sigismund Goetze, an artist resident in this country, inspired by a speech made at a public dinner by the Archbishop of Canterbury, offered to paint at his own expense a series of mural frescoes on canvas to be affixed to the walls of the first floor of the Foreign Office, at the head of the Great Staircase. This offer was accepted by Lord Beauchamp on behalf of the then Government in 1914. The assent of the Cabinet, to whom a model was shown, was procured; and Mr. Goetze proceeded, except when interrupted by long spells of illness, to the execution of the work.The first I heard of the matter was in January 1919, when I assumed acting charge of the Foreign Office in the absence of Mr. Bulfour in Paris. I was asked to send someone from the Foreign Office to inspect the panels which were understood to be ready. A question was raised, in which I took no personal part or interest, as to the allegorical representation of Belgium and Serbia in one of the frescoes, and I left this to be arranged with the artist.My sole contribution to the discussion at this stage was a request that one at least of the panels should be hung in the proposed site in the Foreign Office, so that I might form some idea of the scheme as a whole.   This was done in February 1919.Without professing in the smallest degree to be an art-expert, I have vet been so much associated with art in various forms, and particularly with pictorial art, that I could not fail to form some opinion upon the experiment thus made. That opinion was entirely unfavourable. From the single panel hung which I invite any of my colleagues who is so inclined to come to the Foreign Office and see-1 was convinced that the Foreign Office was about to be made the victim of a form of mural decoration not only quite unsuited to the character and style of the building, but recalling some of the least attractive features of modern German and Austrian pictorial art. Similar decorations are quite common in modern Town Halls, public buildings, hotels, and restaurants in the capital cities of the Continent. Without presuming to criticise the skill or ability, or even the technical accomplishment of the artist, I felt that both the conception and the execution of his scheme were foreign to an English public building like the Foreign Office, and that to decorate in this way the main hall of that office  where the official receptions used to be and mav again be held would excite the severest criticism, if not of the world of art for whom I could not speak-at any rate of the public at large. I found that my suspicions were confirmed without qualification by everyone-including persons of admitted artistic competence-whom I invited to see the panel. They uniformly pronounced it to be theatrical in conception and meretricious in effect. One eminent art critic described the style adopted as the Marie Corelli of painting. Another likened it to the drop-scene of a theatre. Among those who saw the panel was Lord Grey of Fallodon, the Foreign Secretary who had originally accepted the gift, and whose view as to its unsuitability coincided with my own.   I also showed[3113]
it to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Crawford, Lord Beauchamp, and others who had either had some connection with the scheme or were qualified to advise. The staff of the Foreign Office were unanimously and fiercely opposed to the project.At the same time 1 felt most reluctant to do anything that would injure the ieelings of the artist who had planned the work with so much generosity and had devoted so much time and labour to carrying it out. The idea occurred to me that some other place in a public building in London might be found where the scheme would be less in conflict with its surroundings and where the patriotism of the artist would meet with due recognition, [saw and had a correspondence with Lord Downham, Chairman of the London County Council, and enquired whether the new buildings of the Council, now in course of erection on*the other side of the Thames, might provide such an opportunity. He and the Vice-Chairman saw the panel already executed, and were given the dimensions of the remainder. They very courteously offered to provide wall space for the entire series.In August 1919 I saw Mr. Goetze and submitted this idea to him. Tie rejected it with indignation, sent me a memorandum with a narrative of his connection with the scheme up to date, declined to entertain any proposal other than the fixing of the panels in the places for which they had been designed, and invited me to see the remainder of the series at his studio.This visit, owing to the absence first of Mr. Goetze and then of myself, was delayed for some time. But I ultimately saw the greater part of the paintings in Mr. Goetze&apos;s house, and unfortunately found the impressions which had been left upon me by the single panel at the Foreign Office more than confirmed by the rest of the series. These were of a character that would, I thought, produce a shock of great surprise if placed permanently on the walls of the Foreign Office.Still feeling most reluctant to act on my own judgment, I subsequently wrote a letter to Mr. Goetze, dated the 14th December, 1919, which contained these words : &quot; I should be sorry if the decision as to the hanging of your panels in the Foreign Office were to rest exclusively with myself, since, although the responsi-bility in the last resort is mine, you may very likely object to the judgment of a layman. I would propose, therefore, that at your leisure the entire series of frescoes be hung on the walls of the Foreign Office in the place for which you designed them. I would then propose to summon a Committee, consisting of the most competent experts whom I can find, to see them in situ and to favour me with their advice. I propose to ask the following experts to constitute this Committee : &quot; The Director of the National Gallery ; &quot; The Director of the Tate Gallery ; &quot; The Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum ; &quot; and a E.A. painter to be nominated by the President of the Royal Academy.&quot; The opinion of such a body will carry great weight not merely with me but with the entire artistic world, and will relieve me of the responsibility of arriving at a decision alone. I shall be glad to know when it will suit your convenience to have the paintings hung.&quot;Mr. Goetze answered this letter on the 20th December, declining to allow the remainder of the series to be hung because of the risk of damage to the paintings and because he did not possess the necessary appliances, rejecting the proposal of a *   Committee, and insisting upon the strict fulfilment of the terms of the original commission.I thereupon offered to bear the expense of hanging the remaining panels myself, feeling that in justice to Mr. Goetze his scheme (which was not even complete at his studio, some of the principal panels being at Hertford House) should be seen as a whole.This offer also, after the lapse of a month, he declined.The matter has now been brought before the Cabinet by Sir Alfred Mond, and a decision must clearly be taken.The case is presented by the First Commissioner of Works as one of principle, viz., whether &quot;the acceptance by the late Cabinet of an offer by an artist without remuneration for a definite position in a Government building can be revoked by the present Secretary of State, who was not a member of that Cabinet&quot; ; an&amp; this position
(which is far from being mine, since I have offered to share such responsibility as I possess with an expert Committee, and since in the last resort the decision must clearly be that of the Cabinet as a whole, not of an individual member of it) is described as &quot; striking at the security of any artist in the future who is in course of executing any national work.&quot;I am quite unable to share this view. The terms of the letter in which Lord Beauchamp accepted the gift in 1914, as communicated to me by Mr. Goetze, were as follows: -&quot; Dear Mr. Goetze, &quot; May 13, 1914.&quot; I have now seen both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. They commission me to accept your generous (and anonymous) offer with warmest thanks.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government has every reason to appreciate the very generous gift which you are good enough to offer.&quot; A small Committee will probably be appointed to consult with you upon one or two matters of detail and to consider any questions of international relations such as must inevitably arise. But you shall be kept fully informed on these matters.&quot; Let me add an expression of my personal appreciation of your gift, which is of a kind all too rare in England to-day., &quot; Yours sincerely,&quot; Beauchamp.&quot;I am not aware that the Committee contemplated by Lord Beauchamp was ever appointed or sat, nor can I conceal my surprise that an offer such as this, whatever the assumed competence of the artist, for the decoration of one of the great public buildings of the Empire, should have been accepted without any apparent attempt to secure the support of artistic authority.As to the legal aspect of the case I am not competent to advise. But I do not imagine that it can be suggested that any man is bound in law to accept a gift because he said he would, or bound in law to put up in his house a picture which he does not like because he said he would, or bound to make any payment in respect of that which is clearly understood to be a gift although I personally would recommend any suitable payment in the present case, if by so doing we could escape from this fatal commission.Neither do I believe that any successor of Lord Beauchamp or of Lord Grey can be bound by any obligation i if such there was, which I dispute) incurred by him. To argue that such a successor could not, even supposing that all the gifts had been delivered, decide at any time that they should be removed would be in effect to contend that the artistic idiosyncrasies of an individual First Commissioner of Works could for all time disfigure the walls of our public institutions. Such a view is of course absurd.At the same time I fully recognise that Mr. Goetze has good cause for feeling aggrieved at the final reception given to an effort on his part, the public spirit and munificence of which I should be the last to disparage, and which may possess artistic merits which I am incapable of appreciating. In my interviews with him I have endeavoured to make full allowance for these sentiments on his part; but I cannot say  as a witness could testify that I have been so fortunate as to elicit from him the faintest response.It was, however, with the sincere hope of finding an acceptable way out of a difficult situation that I proposed the Expert Committee to which I have referred. Sir Alfred Mond, in one passage of his Memorandum, argues that &quot; the submission of the work to a Committee, a condition which was never imposed when the arrangement with Mr. Goetze was entered into, is irrelevant to the issue in question and an extremely unfair imposition to impose on any artist.&quot; &apos; But, in another place he states that Mr. Goetze objects to my Committee on grounds which I will presently examine; but is willing to submit his work to a Committee nominated by the President -of&quot;the Executive Committee of the Royal Academy.  .The reasons for which I proposed a Committee were not merely to relieve myself of the responsibility of decision, but because I know of no other method by which Mr. Goetze&apos;s work can be fairly and impartially judged. Such a Committee ought in my opinion to have been set up at a much earlier stage, and indeed the light-heartedness with which an artist, not himself a Royal Academician, was permitted, on the strength only of a small scale model, - ercarry out this bold and grandiose scheme for the deco-
ration of one of our foremost public buildings, is to me not the least astonishing feature of the case.The reasons for which 1 proposed this particular Committee were the following : I proceeded upon the close analogy of a Committee appointed by the Government to consider the designs for medals and memorial scrolls in connection with the recent war, the members of which were not sculptors or artists, but the Director ol the National Gallery, the Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Keeper ol Coins and Medals at the British Museum. I accordingly suggested the names of the Directors of the three great Galleries of London, Mr. Holmes from the National Gallery, Mr. Aitken from the Tate Gallery, and Sir Cecil Harcourt Smith from the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as a lioyal Academician to be nominated by the President of the Iloyal Academy. Mr. Goetze says that not one of the three first gentlemen has ever written a line upon, or evinced an interest in, the Art of Mural Decoration. This is indeed a bewildering assertion. Mr. Holmes has written frequently and copiously on the subject, besides being himself an artist. Sir Cecil Harcourt Smith is the head of the National Collection which is especially consecrated to Applied and Decorative Art. It is the duty of the Director of the Tate Gallery to be conversant with every aspect and phase of contemporary painting. As for the representative of the Iloyal Academy, the President would presumably, if invited, appoint the most competent man for the purpose.I cannot accept Mr. Goetzes alternative suggestion of a Committee of painters alone, for two reasons: firstly that this is a Government Building which is involved, and that the canons of decoration lor such a building must bear some relation to the public and official purposes lor which it is used ; and secondly that a Committee confined exclusively to artists might find it difficult to hold the scales quite even in a case where a fellow-artist is concerned.I hope to have shown in the above narrative that I have endeavoured by repeated suggestions to find a solution of this question that would not be repugnant to the feelings of the painter : (1.) I have suggested an alternative and, as it seems to me, far more suitable site, for his frescoes in one of the foremost public buildings of London.(2.) I have asked that they may all be provisionally hung in the Foreign Office before a final decision is taken.(3.) I have suggested an Expert Committee to examine and report upon them a suggestion which I repeat.All of these suggestions have so far been refused: and we are now invited by the First Commissioner of Works to cai-yout the original project without any modification. To that invitation I cannot personally respond, since I am convinced that to set up these frescoes in the Foreign Office would be to expose ourselves and the Secretary of State who was regarded as responsible for such a decision to a storm ol well-merited criticism and attack.Foreign Office,May -H, 1920.o
