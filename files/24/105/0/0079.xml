MINISTRY OF FOOD (CONTINUANCE) bill referred to Committee of Home affairs memorandum BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER(1) I submit a draft Bill for the continuance of the Ministry of Food in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 22nd March last.(2)       I considered that it would have been an advantage for many reasons to get rid of the D.O.R.A. Regulations altogether,t,and to set out the Food Controller^ powers in a concise form more appropriate to the present circumstances, and I had a draft Bill prepared on those lines, but in deference to the strongly expresoed views of the Parliamentary Counsel that a Bill continuing the present powers ?/ould meet with less opposition, especially In Committee, the present Bill has been prepared on the lines of the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) bill   I attach a copy of my original draft in case   my view should be preferred.(3)       The principal Regulations which it is proposed to continue are(a) 2F (1) which confers general administrative powers on the Food Controller.(b) 2G and 2H which relate to returns and inform-isation and enquiries,&apos; and 2JJ which/mainlya subsidiary clause for facilitating adminis-tration.(4)     In addition, I consider that it is necessary to retain certain powers for use in special circumstances only.   These are the powers conferred by Regulations 2B and 2F (2) relating to requisitioning of food supplies, and 2JJJ which relates to the requisitioning of road transport.   It may be possible to drop/
drop some of the powers contained in this last Regulation.It will be seen from paragraph.2 of the Schedule that It is proposed to modify the arbitration provisions in Regulation 2B, 2P (2) and 2JJJ by substituting a uniform tribunal, and by omitting the directions to the arbitrator contained in those regulations.In connection with the administration of the bread subsidy, the Flour Mills are controlled under Regulation 2GG, and it will be necessary to rotaln this Regulation so far as relates to the mills.The   limitation In the Schedule on the power of the Food Controller to make Orders for encouraging production, has been agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture.I do not think that it is necessary to take any special power in the Bill for the transfer   to my Ministry of the powers of the Wheat Commission or the Sugar Commission, as that is mainly a matter of administration.The Cabinet requested me to insert a clause in the new Dill transferring the control of hops to the Board of Trade forthwith, &quot;but I understand that the Board of Trade are unwilling to undertake the task.   The President of the Board of Agriculture thereupon requested me to insert in the new Bill the following clause the provisions of this Act so far as they are applicable to hops shall continue In foroe notwithstanding anything in this Act until the first day of September nineteen hundred and twenty-five, but after the office of Food Con-troller ceases to exist the powers of the Food Controller thereunder shall be exercisable by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and in relation to any such powers this Act shall have effect as if t&amp;e Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries were substituted for the Food Controller.iV
It has beon pointed out to me that this involves the insertion of a five-years clause In a two-years Bill, and that if the Board of Agriculture do not desire to insert a special provision in their own Bill; matters might be left as they are and the hop growers promised a short Continuance Bill if the powers of my Dep^rbment, are finally terminated in 1922.   In tho view of the Minister of Agriculture this would not give the hop growers the requisite confidence to induce them at twice to oomonoe the replanting of hops,.   1 leave the point for the (J a bine I to decide,I ask for leave to introduce the Bill, and I should be grateful if the matter could be considered early next week.CHAHLSS A, M^OTJRDY,14th April ,1920.
