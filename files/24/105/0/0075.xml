CABINET.Referred to Committee of Home AffairsThe appointment of Women Justices for the County of London has raised the question of what work they are to do.     In the Metropolitan Police Courts district all criminal jurisdiction belongs, with some minor exceptions, exclusively to the Stipendiary Magistrates * and this cannot be altered except by legislation;   and generally speaking to transfer work from the Stipendiaries, who are trained lawyers * to inexperienced lay Justices would be a retrograde step.The work in which women would take most interest and in which they would be most useful is the hearing of children1s cases:   and, apart from the question of women Justices, the time seems to have come when the Children&apos;s Courts in London should be more completely separated from the ordinary Police Courts and their sittings held in other buildings.It is proposed therefore to constitute separate Children&apos;s Courts for London:   there will probably be one central court and three or four others at convenient local centres.    The President will be a Police Liagistrate specially assigned to this work, who will sit at the several courts:   and in each there will be associated with him two lay Justices, a man and a woman selected from a panel.    It is important to confine the jurisdiction to a panel of Justices specially qualified for dealing with cases of children.One of the existing Courts (either Westminster or Marlborough Street) will be discontinued and its area distributed to other Courts as the amount of business justifies this and it will thus be possible to provide a Magistrate and staff for the Children&apos;s Court without incurring any additional expense.This bill has been prepared at the instance of the Lord Chanoellor who concurs in my proposals and will introduce the bill in the House of Lords.13th hay, 1920.E.S.
