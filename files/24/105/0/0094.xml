FUTURE OF THE SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT COMMITTEE.(llSMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY)I have read Sir Laming Worthington Evans&apos; memorandum&apos;with much interest, and entirely agree with&quot;what he says on the weakness of the present position as oompared with that at the time of the Railway Strike in September 1919.     In many points - particularly in the reduction of the number of troops available - it is impossible to regain lost ground, but I think it is very undesirable to make any change&apos; that would further weaken the position.     As Sir Laming Worthington Evans points out, in September 1919 the Ministry of Transport had a staff many of whom had experience of strikes, who formed the headquarters of the organisation. It seems to te almost  Impossible to scrap this experienced staff in a moment and begin de novo with a new staff who could not possibly have the special knowledge and experience of the officers of the Transport Ministry.     In particular, Sir Hardman Lever as chairman of the Finance Sub-Committee and Sir George Beharrell as Intelligence Officer would be irreplaceable.I cannot agree with the suggestion made towards the end of the memorandum that the work should be put in charge of the Home Secretary 4&quot;with a small headquarters staff&quot;.;   (l) I do not think it is right to say that &quot;the emergency arrangements are intended for the better protection of life and property in time of civil commotion&quot;w     The main object of the organisation was to supply the community with food and the other necessaries of life, and the protection of life and property, though in itself essential, was merely auxiliary to the main object of the organisation.(2) If the arrangements for supplying and transporting food, coal, and other necessaries are brought under the direct control of the Home Office, it will be taken as implying that everything that is being done is a matter of Police action;   and this would, in many cases, be unfavourable to securing the service of volunteers, particularly in such matters as food and coal distribution.(-3) I cannot agree with the suggestion that, as the Vote for Expenditure appears in the Estimates under the name of the Home Office, this implies that the Home Office should be in charge of the work.    On the contrary, when it was arranged that the whole expenditure should be included in one Vote under tho nominal charge of the Home Office, it was expressly agreed that the Home Office should not be responsible for the expenditure but merely for collecting the demands of the Departments and distributing the money, and that the Home Secretary in defending the Vote, should have the personal support of the Ministers responsible for the expenditure.(4) The Home Office has  no staff that oan be spared to do. any additional work.   Every branch of,.the Office is worked up to and beyond its full strength
Tho work of the   Protection Committee is carried out by working overtime,and no one in the Department has any experience of such matters as Road Transport.or Canal Transport( which are essentially matters for the Ministry of Transport.I suggest that the proper arrangement is that already approved by the Cabinet by which a Minister without Portfolio would be Chairman   of the Supply and Transport Committee and have general oharge of the organisation. He will have under him the Sub-Committee, of which Mr. Neal is Chairman, which co-ordinates the work of all the Departments and other SubrCommittees and generally devils for the main Committee;   he will be in direct, touch with Committees not attached to any particular Department., such as the Finance Commiteee and the Publicity Committee;   and he will have the assistance of a Chief Civil Commissioner, who will be responsible for the work of the other Civil Commissioners and the organisations for recruiting volunteer labour and guiding the emergency action of the local Authorities.   All the rest of the work should be done by the proper Departments the Ministry of Transport should have charge of Railways, Canal Transport, and Road Transport (Sub-Committees for each) the Ministry cf Shipping, of Water Trans-port (Sub-Committee);   the Ministry of Food, of Food Supplies (no Sub-Committee required);   the Board of Trade, of Coal (Sub-Committee) and of Motor Spirit (Sub-Committee);   and the Home Office and Scottish Office, of Police and protection generally (Protection Sub-Committee).     The $lec-tricity Services Sub-Committee is at present attached to the Ministry of Transport, but could, if necessary, be transferred to the Board of Trade or, if it is desired, the Home Office could again resume responsibility.I feel sure my colleagues will agree with me that the organization is too extensive and the work too onerous to be placed on a Minister whose Departmental and Parliamentary responsibilities are already of the heaviest, and that if the Minister of Transport, with adequate staff under his direct control, cannot himself undertake it, it ought to be under the charge of a Minister without Portfolio.I append a list of the Sub-Committees and departments concerned in the Emergency Arrangements.E.S.15.5.20
