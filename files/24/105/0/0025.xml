fZj-   119(IkMM Ib        jj^jg 0? HIS BM^dlUC Uaj^Tu GOVEfcMiiJT.)Copy ijo.S E 0 I   T,0 ii b I H E T.suiply    labour ipor building.In pursuance of tho pledge given to the House of Commons when a supplementary Estimate for Aevenue Buildings was being discussed in Committee of uupply in February last, my officers, in consultation with officers of the Ministry of Health, have -considered carefully and in detail the extent to which the execution of the building programme projected bj ray department this year would detrimentally affeot the erection of houses under the Housing ,*ct of last year.     In the result, the Minister of Health, whilst recognising that, in view of the present financial exigencies every one of my proposals must have been urgently neoessary for the public service to be allowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to remain in the Estimates and that every endeavour has been made so to design the buildings as to require the employment of the minimum number of those classes of skilled labour which are also required for the erection of houses, considers nevertheless that the furthest he can go by way of assent is to suggest -1.     That all works estimated to cost less than  3,000 should be allowed to proceed.2.     That works already begun which are likely tp be finished during the current year should be allowed to go on.3,     That a special case should be made out forlost Office buildings where it ii. anticipated that more than 7 bri(delayers will be required, but that subject to special consideration of work in London, other cases should be allowed to proceed.4.     That as a general rule Employment Exchanges should be ruled out.5.     That no other building should proceed unless a speoial ease is made proving that it. is imperatively necessary that the particular building in quebtiu should proceed for reasons of safety, public health or to prevent breakdown of essential public services.The&quot;A
(DJbto% Worfes that oa&apos;n proceed in accordance with these suggestions., if applied strictly, have &quot;been agreed and can be classified as shown in Statement &quot;A&apos;\   The remaining Works are shown in Statement &quot;B&quot; and it is necessaryto decide which of these shoule, or should not, &quot;be allowed to proceed, in spite ox the belie! of the kinistor of Health that the,/ will interfere with the erection of .&apos;&quot;.:ousos.   in practically every case, postponement of the particular&apos;schemecitheris only possible/by trie curtailment of the activities of the &quot;Department concerned or by tho adoption of some financially less advantageous alternative which at the same time \ ould require the employment of almost -as much skilled labour,   I feel, therefore, that it is impossible for me to assent to the postponement of any one of these schemes without the concurrence of the kinister for whoso use the building; is destined and that in any case, a final adjudication can only be given in many cases by a kinister who is not himself interested either&apos; in the scheme or in housing.   Purther, it is essential that a final decision should be reached within the nest few days, and, as this could not be secured, by the normal method of negotiation between the Departments concerned, I venture to suggest that a Committee of the Cabinet be at once aaaointed to consider the mabter and report.(3d. ) ALPPISD MOilD.H.Mo Office of Works., 4th Hay, 19 0,
