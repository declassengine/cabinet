East Persia. Please refer to your telegram of 26th April, No. 1474. Owing to high rate of wastage among camels in East Persia, particularly on section Duzdap-Neh, maintenance of force is becoming increasingly difficult and threatens in near future to become impossible unless we draw upon our Indian frontier reserves, which, in present situation, would be most inadvisable. We are therefore compelled to press for as early a decision as possible as to when witli-drawal is likely to take place, and to emphasise once more that if the force is retained in any strength the construction of Duzdap railway section will be essential. In the event of the force being retained for any length of time the extension will, moreover, be far more economical than camel transport. Alternative of employing motor transport has been exhaustively examined and tested, but has been ab ndoned as impracticable.
