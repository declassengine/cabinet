(i i i) Letter from the presiuen t of the Board of Trade J^o the Secretary, cabinet, dated 4th May, 192Q.Board of Trade,Great George Street, S,W. l.My dear Hankey.The facts as to the cokf position in relation to Prance are as follows .:-It   It is not likely that we shall be able t; ch f-r France as much as wo have been d ing in the last few months.   It will be noted from the attached fibres that France is actually receiving a greater quantity of coke than she did before the mar.2.     As regards the exportation of c;;ke to which M. Millerand&apos; telegram especially refers it is not practicable without throwing English furnaces out of employment to export the quantity that France has hitherto been receiving.   All that can be exported without detriment to the supply of our own needs is being and will be exported, but the figure cannot be as high as in recent months.   In view of the present home supply and demand we cannot hope to export more than frem 8 to 10,000 tons per week to all countries. 3..     our feeling is, that, of such coke as can be exported, Italy should have preference to a supply before France; her situation for both coal and coke being incomparably worse.in addition we should reserve some margin for Scandinavia wha in pre-war times took 75$ of our coke exports. I must leave you to put these rather harsh facts tc the French as best you may.If it is imperative to maintain and even to increase exper-tation to France it will be necessary that the Coal Department should have specific instructions which they can produce to our own manufacturers whose demands in such circumstances cannot be met.Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.)

Note by Signor flitti (Enclosure to (ih&apos;(Handed to the Pr ime. Minister,fr,V..Signor Nitti at San Re mo .      , onTng April. l,9&quot;2o7T7The Italian Prime Minister urgently requests Mr.Lloyd , George to kindly give his friendly considernation to the following points, concerning the provisioning of Italy with English coalt-1.    The assurance that England will furnish us with 500,000 tons monthly, at the very least.    ,This might be possible if the Coal Controller were instructed to avoid any requisition of the ooal, that is destined for Italy, within the limits as above.si i .     In the 500,000 tons mentioned should be included a: the lots of coal, that the Italian Government and Italian firms have acquired at lower prices than the present one.    This mi^ht be possible if the Ooal Controller were instructed to advise the firms   that sell the ooal, that the amount of coal hought by Italy, up to a maximum of 500,000 monthly, will not be subjeot to requisitioning, and also that the ooal acquired by Italy, including,that bought in the past, must be delivered.- 43./
3.     In the 500,000 tons mentioned should be included certain definite quantities of special coal (splint gas) within tho limits already indicated to the British Authorities by the Italian Delegation in London.I do not think it would be possible to add to these re-quests also the abolition of discriminating prices, as the said request was already submitted to the Prime Minister in Paris, and the answer was in the negative, for reasons de-pendent on internal politics. ,It may be added that the volition of discriminating prices -v&apos;ould immediately brine internal prices to the level of the actual prices for ernortation, but would not briner about a reduction of the latter,It is also reouestod that the English Government take Stei s promptly with regard to the difference in price between the coal for internal consumption, sold at 55 shillings, and the coal sold abroad at an average price of 120 shillings.     This difference weighs heavily on the Italian industrial enterprises and also furnishes matter for unfavourable comment&apos;1 concerning the attitude oi,&apos; England towards Italy.fii).     letter from the President of the Board, of(1)   V.   -**o tioinR our utmost to secure thut, of the total coal available for export, Italy on the whole gets the first priority, but it is impossible to give an assurance that 500,000 tons monthly shall be exported without doing/away with the principle - adopted by the Government - of a free market in the exportable surplus, and without setting up a large organisation to securo allocation of definite quantities to Italy and other Allies and Neutrals.     It must be re-membered that we do not know what the real inland demand in this coontry is, as, so far, the home demand has not been met.     It is increasing monthly as industries progress.(2)   Definite instructions have been given to tho local Committees to do their best to see that of such coal as is available to go to Xtaly, as well as France, the maximum amount possible shall go at such prices as may be contracted for. It is not practicable to go further than this a    It is unfortunately to be remembered that Italian contracts do not apparently exist for any considerable quantities for the remainder of this year, and it is impossible to ff^runteethat

tIfIII,&apos;       Memorandum dated Ar,ril, 26th,192*. A i^communicated by Lord Derby tfl\ the Prime Jljninter *It is a well-known fact that French public opinion, whether rightly of wrongly; is convinced that Great Britain is reaping undue advantage and gathering extortionate profits from the supply of British coal to France.     It is not necessary t* examine whether this contention be accurate or not, but it is the duty of the Agents of His Maiesty&apos;s Government on the spot to draw attention to the state of feeling existing in the country in which they are stationed; and I should like, therefore, in indicate that, far from diminishing, the opinion that our policy in this and other respects * is selfish and immoral is increasing, and that this situation is not one which tends to enhaftee the maintenance of harmonious economic relations with France.   I recognise that, whatever be the merits of the case, the difference is largely one of standpoint.   The French present a moral claim which may or may not be justified, and the British reply with arguments which are, no doubt, sound economically but which do not meet, Or reply to-, this moral claim - hence a gulf which cannot be bridged.   Briefly put, the French claim is-that France is entitled to a special treatment on account of her special position as a belligerent, that privileged treatment was promised her during the war, and that, in fact, she is not receiving such privileged treatment.   To this our reply apparently is that FranceI     iIs placed in the same position as other most favoured foreign entities.This .is precise!;; &quot;the burden of the French complaint.   This reply &quot;does not satisfy one French Government or French public opinion. What they demand is, that British coal should be supplied to France&apos; an the same terms as it is supplied to consumers in the United Kingdom, and they present this&apos; demand on moral grounds * What we reply amounts&apos;to&apos;the following.&apos;&apos;question &quot;Purely you do not expect that a sacrifice should be nade to the extent of supplying British coal, so far as we are eoncerned, *o the Inhabitants of-7- Paris    I
i 13Paris at the same price as such coal is supplied to the inhabitants of London&quot;?; and, as this is precisely what the French are asking for, and as tjiey consider that this claim rests on irresistible moral grounds, our question does not, in their opinion, answer their request.The coal question is the chief question in which French public opinion, whether rightly or wrongly, considers that Great Britain is acting unfairly, but to this must be added such questions as the supply of wool, the practical monopoly lately secured by British subjects of the supply of flax, and others o-rrep which we ha^e really no control, such as the rate of exchange, which all contribute   to the present feeling of hostility towards our country.      French governmental circles are therefore at present being led to contemplate s^me fnrm of retaliation, and I ha**e had an example of this brought to my notice lately with regard to the question of the export of bauxite from this country to the United Kingdom.   I need hardly recall that b auxite. is an essential raw material for aluminium factories, and that the only sources of supply are France and the United States.   A British Aluminium Company recently asked for licences for the export of about 30,0C0 tons of b auxite from France, and received a reply to the effect thai, the matter- would ha*e to be considered in the light of the fac/-sufficient attention was not being paid to the &quot;delicate question of freight and coal.&quot;     In addition to writing to the competent Department, I ha^e spoken to Monsieur Seydoux on this subject:. Monsieur Seydoux, who,.-in addition to being able is also ^ery reasonable, adopted the attitude that such a reply was justifiab! &quot;en principle&quot;.   The French aluminium companies were quite unabl to produce aluminium in competition with the British companies since they Irad to pay ex orbitant prices for British coal which was being supplied at an infinitely lower price to their British competitors *   In these, circumstances, how could it beexpected
expected that, unless there were a quid pro quo, the French .       should supply an essential raw material to a British industryin order&apos; that tills British Industry should produce more cheaply than their French competitors add cut them out?Tho French Government were contemplating putting an export duty on &quot;bauxite, which would, equalise conditionsof production, ann export would then freely be granted..Until this was dono^ it was elementary justice that unlesstho ether side would do something to help, the French shouldnot assist the British producer to compete on unequal terms /with the French producer-I think that I managed to persuade Monsieur Seydoux that the proper way to raise this question was to write*these views to the Embassy, for transmission to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that meanwhile licences should be granted.   AsI pointed out, the withholding of licences pending an extra supply of coal at home prices ear-marked for the French aluminium industry, would - savour too much of a &quot;hold-up&quot;,., and would consequently not gain so favourable a hearing as the more generous policy of granting licences and then making an appeal for consideration.:.   But the views of this eminently reasonable and moderate man... who spends his time curbing the more violent opinions of other French officials and business men, serve to show the complexion of moderate French thought on the subject.,The Press, which in France is so often inspired by governmental circles, generally gives a forecast of what we may expect to happen, and I therefore make no excuse for quoting the gist of an article which appeared on the 23rd instant in the &quot;Soir&quot;v   This article, which is entitled &quot;Let us fight, on equal terms&apos;&apos;1 (&quot;Luttons a armes egales11) and which has for a sub-heading   Against the coal policy of England&quot; (&quot;Centre le polltlque du charhen de 11Angleterre&quot;) says thatII It is necessary to put a special export duty on certainwhich are of vital necessity a:- certain foreign countries commodities/and. above, all,, to Englandc   Some of these commodities are: iron.ore, bauxite, pit props, Algerian and Tunisianphosphate -
phosphates/Alsatian pcfwlx?. otc^ Tho-article- goes on to say &quot;we ha^e already said that England,- which is our main--truppjit-i-. Is selling coal to us at an exorbitant price:, this pricer. at the present time,-, is more than double that for British, buyers and thus British manufacturers ha^e a double advantage. In the first place, they are privileged so far as the price of coal Is concerned, and in the second placer they need not fear competition from the French industry since they can pro-duce cheaper.-&apos;1   The article further says that &quot;As against this British policy, the French are foolish enough to sell to the English certain products, such as iron ore? bauxite,, etc., which are I ndispensable to the British industry, at the same price as that governing the sale to French manufactur ers and without the French Government raising one centime on the export of these products.   Tho time has come to put a stop to this state of affairs, and to put a tax on exports which will counterbalance the advantages accruing to British industry.&quot;British FJmbassy, Paris, 26th April, 1920.-10
