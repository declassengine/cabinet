V&apos;2&apos;85 13TH MAY, 192QInformation has reached the Shipping Controller that the French and Italian Governments are taking, or contemplating, steps which will have the effect of confining the emigration trade, which originates or passes through their ports, to their own national vessels.   This is so serious a threat to our permanent shipping interests that the Cabinet are invited to deal with it as a matter of urgency.The Germans in the period before the war got the larger part of the European Emigration trade into their own-hands, largely through their system of control stations, by which they directed the stream of emigration crossing their territory into the two great German lines.The French and the Italians during the Peace negotiations in Paris entirely shared our view that a recurrence of this practice on the part of the Germans must be made impossible, but they know as well as we do that the emigration trade is the backbone of the Atlantic trade, and it looks as if they were unable to resist the temptation to confine allpassingemigrants of any Nattonality/through their ports to their own ships.The Cunard Company informed the Ministry of Shipping that the French Government is declining to issue licences to British companies to embark emigrants for ^America at French Channel ports,   in the case of Italy, a report dated April 22nd, from   the Commercial Counsellor of the Bnbassy at Rome confirms previous information that there is a strong movement in Italy in favour of issuing a decree that emigrants passing through the, Italian ports should be carried only on Italian ships.   If such a decree were made,,,with Flume under Italian control, and if the French persist in their present attitude of refusing licenses 60 British companies, it will mean that our lines will be shut out from the whole of the emigration trade from Southern Europe and from all1  &apos; ythat portion of the trade which passes through French Ports./Thewarn! -
The result would be extremely serious to the British lines in the Atlantic, and consequently to our whole Atlantic position, and the Shipping Controller urges very strongly that every possible step should be taken, while we still have the means in our power, to induce the French and Italians to alter their present attitude *Very strong pressure will be required, as the Interests in France and Italy will resist to the utmost, and the Governments, will naturally wish to strengthen their own mercantile marine. The Shipping Controller recommends that the French and Italian Governments should toe made to realise that the retention by this country of its shipping position is as vital to us a3 is the supply of coal t.o France and Italy, and that we must insist on absolutely fair treatment being given to our ships,   ?,re do not ask for anything except absolute equality for all, but if y/e are to supply necessities to France and Italy we have a right to expect a binding guanantee that there shall be no differentiation, direct or indirect, against our ships in the ports of our late Allies.If the Cabinet agree In principle with the above proposals the Foreign Office could, in consultation with the Departments concerned, determine the form in which the matter should be put to the French and Italian Governments.(sgd)     J.P. MACLAY.
