4hJ.       272 -This Document is tho Property of , Ai1-^     &apos;       &quot;3Ga3 ^CUIATIOIi 3ILI Ml^gggflMJj-thc President of the Board of Trade,) i    0 &apos;  iI circulate a draft of a Bill to amend the law relating to the supply of gas,The Sill is partly &quot;based upon the recommendations made to the Board of Trade by the Fuel Research Board in a Report dated 29th January,1919, (Cmd,108) on gas standards and the basis for charges, and is also designed to restore financial stability to the industry*It is proposed by the Bill to provide (1) that charges for gas shall be based upon the number of heat units supplied to the consumer instead of upon the number of cubic feet&quot;of the gas supplied as at present;    (2) for the necessary adjustment of standard^and maximum prices and sliding scale provisions and for an addition to the price to compensate for the increased cost of production and supply of gas&quot;; (3) for the more efficient testing of the gas and (4) for facilities for the obtaining by gas undertakers of further powers without direct recourse to Parliament.   The Bill will apply to undertakings owned by Looal Authorities as well as to companies1 undertakings.In effect, the Bill is one for the reconstruction ofthe gas industry and the adjustment of the statutory obligationsimposed upon the industry in regard to the quality and price of gas in the light of modern requirements *The main recommendation of the Fuel&apos;Research Board was that the existing system of charging the consumer for the volume of gas of a certain nominal illuminating or calorific value which passes through his meter should be replaced -by-one in which he is charged directly for the potential thermal units he receives.   Subject to this they advised that much greater latitude might be given to gas undertakers with regard to tho nature of the gas supplied by the in so as to make it possible for the gas industry to take advantage of any improvements in the technical processes of the manufacture of gas and to supply such gas as can be most economically produced0The alteration in the system of charging necessitates a more efficient system of testing the gas, and the Bill while allowing gas undertakers to supply gas of any calorific value which they declare they propose to supply makes provision for the extension of the functions of the gas referees and. of the chief gas examiner, which are at present confined to London, to the whole country so that testing everywhere will in future be carried out according to their directions, Provision is also made that in the case of the larger undertakings a continuous test of the heat value of the  ,as shall be made by means of a recording calorimeter.As there are more than 800 statutory undertakings and the circumstances of each will require separate consideration,
it is desirable that the machinery by which the Bill shall be brought into operation shall be as simple as possible,   Clause 1 therefore provides for the making of Departmental Orders by tho Board of Trade for this purpose.The intention of the proposals in the Clause relating to the addition to be made to the existing standard or maximum prices is that additional costs of production and supply shall be allowed for, thus enabling undertakings as a general rule to earn approximately their pre-war rate of profit.Power is taken in Clause 9 for the Board of Trade to make special Orders for the same purposes as they can now make Provisional Orders under the C-as and Waterworks Facilities Act,1870, together with the other purposes specified in the Clause including power to authorise arrange-ments for the joint working or amalgamation of undertakings,.The costs of administering the Act are proposed to be met by the formation of a gas fund for which a levy is to be nado on the industry.The chief provisions of the Bill have been fully discussed in the last few weeks with representatives of the various interests concerned, and it is not thought that there will be much opposition to any of tho proposals0The serious financial -position of tho industry is checking all development,,   further tho Gas &quot;-Yorkers1 Union are at present taking a ballot of their members (returnable on the 18th May)   on the question cf striking in support of a demand for additional wages and holidays; and the gas companies will make no concessions until the Government proposals are announceddI should be glad therefore if the Cabinet will authorise me to introduce the Bill next week.R.3.HORNS.13th May,1920*

D E A E TOP ABILLTOAmend the Law with respect to the supply of Gas.    a.d. 1920.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 5 Price and Quality of Gas.1. (1) The Board of Trade may, on the application of any Power to gas undertakers, by order, provide for the repeal of any enact- J^basis merits or other provisions requiring the undertakers to supply of charges, gas of any particular illuminating or calorific value, and for 10 substituting power to charge for thermal units supplied in the form of gas.(2) An order under this section may provide for mocli-fying the statutory or other provisions affecting the charges which may be made by the undertakers by substituting for the 15 standard or maximum price authorised under those provisions a standard or maximum price for each hundred thousand British thermal units (in this Act referred to as &quot; a therm &quot;).(3) The price per therm fixed by the order shall be a price corresponding as nearly as may be to the price fixed by those 20 provisions for each thousand cubic feet, but with such addition (if any) as appears to the Board reasonably required in order to meet unavoidable increases since the thirtieth day of June nineteen hundred and fourteen in the costs and charges of and incidental to the production and supply of gas [by the under-25 takers; and the order may make such modifications of any provisions whereby the rate of dividend payable by the under-takers is dependent on the price of gas supplied as appear to the Board to be necessary: y     123-6 A 2
a.d. 1920. Provided that if at any time it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade that the cost of production and supply of gas has substantially altered from causes not within the control of the undertakers the Board may, if they think fit, on the application of the undertakers or of the local authority, or 5 where the local authority are the undertakers, of twenty con-sumers, make an order in respect of any undertaking corres-correspondingly revising the powers of charging authorised in pursuance of this section, and the amending order shall have as full force and effect as the original order. 10(4) An order under this section-(a) shall prescribe the time when and the manner in whichthe undertakers are to give notice of the calorific value of the gas which they intend to supply (in this Act referred to as the declared calorific value); 15 and(b) shall require the undertakers, before making  any alteration in the declared calorific value, to take at their own expense such steps as may be necessary to alter, adjust, or replace the burners in 20 consumers&apos; appliances in such manner as to secure that the gas can be burned with safety and efficiency; and(c) may make such supplemental and consequential pro-visions as appear necessary to give full effect to 25 the order; and(d) shall come into operation on such date as may befixed by the order; and(e) shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.(5) If within two years after the passing of this Act 30 any gas undertakers have not applied to the Board of Trade for an order under this section, the Board of Trade may, after giving not less than three months&apos; notice to the undertakers, make an order applying to that undertaking, which shall have the same effect as an order made on the application of the 35 undertakers.(6) Before making an order under this section, the Board of Trade shall require the undertakers to give public notice in such manner as the Board may consider best adapted for informing persons affected of the application for an order, and of the maxi- 40 mum or standard price per therm proposed, and as to the manner
in which and time within which objections may be made, and A.D. 1920. shall consider any objection which may be duly made, and shall, where they think it expedient to do so, cause an enquiry to be held.5 (7) The calorific value of gas means, for the purposes of this Act, the number of British thermal units produced by one cubic foot of the gas burned under normal conditions in a calorimeter prescribed by the Gas Referees under this Act.2. (1) Where an order under this Act has been made Special 10 affecting any undertaking, the price to be charged by the under- astakers for gas supplied by means of a prepayment meter shall be ment meters, the same as that charged for gas supplied by an ordinary meter, but the order relating to the undertaking may provide for an addition to the price per therm of gas supplied by means of a 15 prepayment meter to include the hire of the meter and any fittings used therewith, and the provision, letting, fixing, repairing and maintenance of the meter and the fittings (if any), and the cost of collection, inspection and any other costs incurred by the undertakers in connection with the meter and the fittings.20 (2) The undertakers shall clearly show on the receipt given for payment of gas supplied, the rate per therm charged for the gas and the rate for the meter and the fittings (if any) used therewith.3&apos;. (1) Where an order under this Act has been made Composition 25 affecting any undertakers, the gas supplied by those under- *jd,pr^(b^ takers, in addition to conforming to the conditions prescribed supplied, in the order, shall comply with the following conditions, that is to say: (i) it shall not contain any trace of sulphuretted hydrogen 30 when tested in the manner required by this Act;(ii) it shall be supplied at not less than the minimum permissible pressure;(iii) it shall not, if so prescribed by the order, contain more than the  permissible  proportion   of  incombustible 35 constituents:Provided that the foregoing requirements shall not apply &apos;   as respects a separate supply of gas by any undertakers for industrial purposes only, but an order may impose such other conditions with regard to gas supplied by those undertakers for 40 those purposes as appear necessary to the Board of Trade. 123 A 3
A. D. 1920. (2) Where an order provides that the gas supplied by any undertakers is not to contain more than the permissible pro-portion of incombustible constituents, the permissible proportion of incombustible constituents shall be, for a period of two years after the passing of this Act, twenty per cent.; for the succeeding 5 two years, eighteen per cent.; and thereafter, fifteen per cent.(3) The minimum permissible pressure shall be a pressure in any main or service pipe of two inches diameter and upwards, of not less than twenty-tenths of an inch, except as may be otherwise provided by the order relating to any undertaking.     1Q(4) The Board of Trade shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act cause an inquiry to be held into the question whether it is necessary or desirable to prescribe any limitations of the proportion of carbon monoxide which may be supplied in gas used for domestic purposes, and may, if on such inquiry it 15 appears desirable, make a special order under this Act prescribing the permissible proportion, and the special order may have effect either generally or as regards particular classes of undertakings, and the provisions of the special order shall have effect as if they were enacted in this section. 20&apos;4. It shall not be lawful for any person to charge for the supply of gas according to the number of British thermal units supplied unless authorised to do so in the manner provided by this Act or by special Act of Parliament.Restriction on power to ehurge for thermal units.Testing of Gas. 25Appoint- 5. (1) The Board of Trade shall appoint three persons, atwent of gus  jeag  one Q  wjlom shaii be a person having practical know-referees and .        . 1examiners,   ledge and experience in the manufacture and supply of gas, to act as gas referees.   The Board of Trade shall also appoint a competent and impartial person to be chief gas examiner.  The 30 gas referees and the chief gas examiner shall hold office for such time as the Board of Trade may direct.Two of the gas referees shall be a quorum and at least two of the gas referees shall concur in every act or determination of the gas referees. 36(2) The local authority may, unless they are themselves the undertakers, appoint a competent and impartial person to be a gas examiner, and to test the gas at the prescribed testing
place, and to test the pressure at which the gas is supplied at a.d, 1920, the testing place or elsewhere:Provided that (a) for the purposes of this section a gas examiner may 5 he appointed to act on behalf of any number oflocal authorities, and the local authorities may enter into such arrangements as they think fit in regard to the joint appointment and employment of such gas examiner; and10 (6) any county council may, if they think fit with theconsent of any sucli local authority within the county, appoint a gas examiner, who shall have the same powers as if he were appointed by the local authority.15 (3) Where no gas examiner is appointed by the local authority, or by the county council, or where the testing of gas , is imperfectly attended to, two justices, on the application of not less than live consumers, may appoint a competent and impartial person to act as gas examiner, who shall have the20 same powers and perform the same duties as if he were appointed by the local authority, and the remuneration and expenses of the gas examiner up to an amount approved by the justices, shall be paid*by the local authority.6. (1) The gas referees may prescribe  Power to* pr6scril)625 (a) the places at which and the apparatus and method tests.by which tests, whether continuous or intermittent, shall be made to ascertain whether the under-takers are supplying gas in accordance with their obligations; and30 (b) the method by which any such apparatus shall beverified; and(c) the time and form of the reports to be made by the gas examiner to the gas referees and the local authority or justices by whom he is appointed, and 35 the means by which the results of the tests shallbe made available to the public.(2) The prescribed apparatus shall, in the case of any under-takers who have manufactured in the preceding year more than one hundred million cubic feet of gas, and in any other case in 40 which it appears necessary to the gas referees, include a calori-123 A i
Appeals to chief gas examiner.A.D. 1920. meter for the production of a continuous record [of the calorific value of the gas which is being supplied.(3) Any undertakers with respect to whom an order has been made under this Act shall provide and maintain to the satisfaction of the referees the prescribed testing places and 5 apparatus, and shall give any gas examiner access to any testing place for the proper execution of his duty.(4s) A representative of the undertakers may be present on any occasion on which, the gas examiner inspects the testing apparatus or tests the gas, but shall not interfere with the 10 inspection or test.(5) The gas referees may at any time for the proper execution of their duties enter upon and inspect any of the works of the undertakers, and the undertakers shall afford them and their assistants full facilities for this purpose, and shall 15 &apos; furnish the referees with such information with regard to theposition of the mains and pipes of the undertakers, and with regard to any other matter as the referees may reasonably require.7. (1) If the undertakers think themselves aggrieved by any prescription of the gas referees they may, within one month 20 from the making of such prescription, appeal to the chief gas examiner, who, after hearing the undertakers and the gas referees and any other body or person interested, may confirm, amend vary, or annul the prescription, and the decision of the chief gas examiner shall be final and conclusive. 25(2) If the undertakers think themselves aggrieved by any report of a gas examiner, they may, within seven days, appeal to the chief gas examiner, who may confirm, amend, or annul the report, and whose decision, after hearing the parties, shall be final and conclusive. 30(3) The report of the chief gas examiner or, if there is no such report, the report of the gas examiner showing a case of deficient calorific value, excess of inert or incombustible constituents, excessive impurity, or insufficient pressure of the gas shall be conclusive evidence of the liability of the 35 undertakers to a forfeiture in respect thereof.Any report of the chief gas examiner purporting to have been signed by him shall for all purposes and to all intents be prima facie evidence of the due making and signing thereof without proof of such signature. 40
8. (1) The salaries, remuneration, pensions, and gratuities A.D. 1920. of the chief gas examiner and the gas referees and their R assistants shall be such as the Board of Trade with the consent tion and of the Treasury may fix. expenses5       (2) (a) Any such salaries, remuneration, pensions, or gratuitous- referees. ties; and(b) any expenses of the chief gas examiner and the gas referees in the execution of their duties or powers under this Act; and 10 (c) any expenses of the Board of Trade which in theopinion of the Treasury are directly attributable to the execution of their powrers and duties under this Act;shall be paid out of the fund established under this section:15 Provided that during the first two years after the passing , of this Act the expenditure for the purposes aforesaid shall to the extent that may he necessary be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament, but such payments shall be treated as advances, and shall be repaid out of that fund with interest at20 such rate as the Treasury may fix.(3) Any undertakers with respect to whom an order under this section has been made, and who in any year ending the thirty-first day of December, have manufactured not less than one hundred million cubic feet of gas shall, on or before the first day25 of April in the following year, pay to a fund (to be called the gas fund) a contribution not being at the rate of more than fifteen pounds for each one hundred million cubic feet of gas so manufactured by them, and the Treasury may determine that that fund shall be a public fund within the meaning of the30 Superannuation Act, 1892. 55 &amp; 56 Viet.c. 40.(4) The Board of Trade shall not later than the fifteenth day of January in each year prescribe the rate at which such contribution shall be payable for that year (which shall not exceed the rate reasonably required to meet the estimated 35 expenditure for the year), and the manner in which and the account to which the contribution shall be paid, and the amount payable by the undertakers shall be a debt due by the under-takers to the Crown, and shall be recoverable accordingly with costs.40 (5) The Board of Trade shall as soon as may be after the thirty-first day of March in every year cause the accounts of the gas fund for the preceding year to be laid before Parliament.i

(l) If in any day for a period exceeding two hours for deficient  jie caiorific value of the gas supplied by any undertakers ascer-vulue, &amp;c. tained in accordance with the provisions of this Act is more 25 than five per cent, below the declared calorific value the under-takers shall.be liable on summary conviction to a forfeiture of one pound for every complete one per cent, by which the calorific value is deficient.(2) If on any occasion the gas does not conform to the 30 provisions of this Act or any order made thereunder as to composition and pressure the undertakers shall be liable on summary conviction to a forfeiture not exceeding ten pounds.(3) The undertakers shall not be liable to any forfeiture under this subsection in any case where they show that the 35 deficiency or failure was due to circumstances not within their control.(4) If in any quarter the average calorific value of the gas supplied by any undertakers, ascertained in manner prescribed by the gas referees, is less than the declared calorific value, a 40
sum which the chief gas examiner shall determine to he as A.D. 1920. nearly as may be the amount by which the revenue of the undertakers has been improperly increased shall, (a) if the undertakers are a local authority, be applied 5 towards a reduction in the price of gas in the nextor some succeeding quarter; and(b) in any other  case, be deducted from   the   divisibleprofits, and the dividend which the undertakers may pay on their ordinary capital shall be correspondingly 10 reduced.(5) Proceedings against the undertakers in respect of any forfeiture incurred under this Act may be commenced at any time within six months after the date of the report of the gas examiner, or after the date of the report of the 15 chief gas examiner on appeal, or in the event of the under-takers duly appealing to the chief gas examiner and witli-drawing the appeal within six months from the date of the receipt of notice of such withdrawal.(6) If, on an appeal to the chief gas examiner, he certifies 20 that the default of the undertakers is not substantial or not due to the careless conduct of the undertakers or of their servants, he may determine the amount of the forfeiture to be paid by the undertakers, and no proceedings shall be taken before a petty sessional court in respect of the default.25 Power to make Special Orders.11.
