THIS BDCUMI.NT 13 THF PROPERTY 0? HIS ERITAifljIc&quot;T THP PRESLHT TPTIDFNCY QF UGEfiMemorandum, by the Minister cf Labour.On 8th March my predecessor circulated a Memorandum tc the Cabinet dealing with the present tendency cf wages TheMemorandum pointed out that the comparatively uniform level of wages , advances which existed at the time of the armistice had been broken as a result.lt of increases given in several trades for reasons other than the rise in the cost of living, and it concluded by stating that it was inevitable that in the near future there would be a considerable upward tendency of wages.   Since the Memorandum was writt&apos;. f, increased wages have been given in a considerable number of trades, while, partly because of the increases r-lready given in other cases, demands for increased wpges are now being considered in other trades,2.   The following are some of the cases in which increases havebeen given since the beginning of March:-(1)   In the tinplate trade in South ftples a further 10% increase, has been given, making an increase of 50% this-year, and an increase over pre-war rates of an average over the different occupations of 177$,(2)   The advances in the tinplate trade have made it necessaryfor the same increases to be given in the adjoining steel trade.(3)   In the.commercial carting industry an increase of 5/- has been given by the Industrial Court,(4)   Tramway-Undertakings have given generally an additional waradvance of G/- a week, but this is not the end of thedemand, and it seems probable that in many towns the full claim of 10/- will be conceded,(5)   The minimum rate for cabinet-makers in the London furniture trade has risen from 2/- to 2/3d an hour, with a further id from May 1st, and similar increases have been given in other districts.(6)   The pianoforte trade has also proposed a rate of 2/3d an hour.(7)   In the Scottish Building Trade the Industrial Court issued an Award on 30th March deciding against the operatives&apos; claim for a further advance of 6d&apos;per hour, but a few days after the issue oi  the Award the employers offered an increase of 1-ld an hour.
(9)   In the Brass trades of Birmingham, where the industrial court recently gave an award against any further advance of wages, the employers, following a strike, have agreed to give an advance ef 4/- per week.(9)   An increase of 6/- a week has been given in the engineering shipbuilding and allied trades by the Industrial&quot;Court.(10)   An increase rf 6/- a week has been given to canal employees.(11) Coal Miners are about to receive a 20$ increase with a minimum of 2/- a day,(12) Industries allied to ooal mining are demanding consequential increases *5.   Some of the trades in which inoreased wages are now being considered are as follows(1 (2(5(4 (5(6 (7Shipbuilding.   The carpenters are voting on an offer of the employers to concede an advance of 12/- a week in addition to the 6/- already granted by the recent shipbuilding award.The dockers are negotiating with their employers for the inoreased minimum of 16/-&apos; a day recommended by Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry6Postal Servants are demanding the equivalent of pre-war wages with an additional 10/- a week.The railwayman are putting in further demands.In the iron and steel trade in the Midland, North-East Coast and Scotland a demand is being considered for an alteration in one of the bases on which wages in this trade are calculated with a view to an increase in the wages of low-pai,d men.Negotiations for substantial increases are taking place in the!qotton trade,iA demand for 3/- an hour as against the present rate of 1/lli Is being formulated in the London building trade.4.   My Department is aware of negotiations for substantial increases .*f wagjes in the following tradesClay jindustryTin MiningFishingBakeryChemicalsPrintingHosierySilk]GlassElectricity UndertakingsFarrieryNeedlesPacking CasesCutleryWagon Building and others5.   It is lObvious that the general level of wages is rising. One of the reasons for these demands is the increase in the cost of living, ,Wt the amounts claimed (and in general the advances given) are in ibxcess of the &quot;cost of living&quot; level.   The cost of iliving/
living will of course in its turn be further increased.   An attempt toaa been made by the Industrial Court to commence a wages policy whioh may break the *vioious circle&apos;.   In their Award po, 100 in the engineering trad.; issued on hiarch 10th the Industrial Court made an important innovation by stating that while no increase of wages was warranted in this trade at the present time on the ground of the increased cost ox living, the present value of the work of the men concerned justified an increase ox 6/- a week.   This was definitely an attempt to put the assessment of wages on the basis of the value cf the work and to abandon as a%r ^ .   ......    -------   .....basis the cost of living.   There is no doubt that it has provoked considerable disoussion and has been of much value in bringing both employers and workpeople to a sense ox the reality of the wages situation.6*   Another reason for the demands for increased wages 4a to be found In the present mobility 9i labour.   In many important trades there is a shortage of labour.   As a result of habits acquired during the war workpeople are more inclined than before to move from job to job and also from place to place as far as housing difficulties permit.   There is widespread evidenoe in the building trade that the demand for labour ia putting up wages far beyond the standards agreed by employers1 and workpeoples1 associations.   This shortage of labour also encourages demands by Trade Unions in the sure knowledge that if they strike the men can readily get employment in other branches of the trade.   A strike in the pianoforte trade in London and a withdrawal of their labour on the part of joiners in the Clyde shipyards are at the moment possible because the building and furniture trades can absorb all woodworkers available.7. High profits continue to lead to increased wages.   This is especially seen in the tinplatc and the cotton trade., and aslong/
long as employers can pass on increased charges to the consumer, that is to say, as long as the demand is insistent and must be satisfied at almost any price, high profits and increased wages are bound to exist.8* There is as yet but little indication that prices have reached the point at which the consumer will go without rather than pay, and istill the c.ase that manufacturers agree to increased wages with comparative cheerfulness as they are sure of being able to get the increase back in higher prices.   A very potent oause of increasing wages is the bidding of employers against one another for certain Classes of labour;   thus the shipbuilders1 recent offer of an increase of 12/- per week to joiners (over and above the general advances) is stated to be due to the fact that men wGre leaving the shipyards in order to get the higher rate in the building trade.   But immediately (in Scotland) the building employers - fearing that the shipyards will attract their joiners - offer an increase of l^d per hour, in the face of an award on whioh the ink was barely dry, and so the rates go up and up.   Bach set of employers blames the others in turn.   It is obvious that this condition of affairs is only possible because employers are making very large profits and feel confident of being able to continue to make them for some time to come*9* A somewhat different set of considerations is operating in the building trade, where there is complete freedom from foreign competition and indeed from British competition and where both employers and employed seem to be in a position to pass on to the consumer any charge, however much increased.   The effect of this is seen in the extraordinary claims which the men are putting forward. Thus in Liverpool, where an advance of 6d per hour was claimedan offer of 4d per hour has been made, plus 3/- per week ntool moneyallowance&quot;, (This follows an advance 3f 4d*   per hourgiven   only eight months ago.) In other   districtsadvances of   6d. per   hour are being   claimed,   whilst   inLondon/
London an advance of if- per hour is asked for.   The significance of these amounts will he realised when it is remembered that the ordinary advance in wages in the building trade before the War was ono farthing or one halfpenny per hour.10.   In considering whet measures, if any, could be taken to alleviate this situation, the last Memorandum discussed and dismissed the possibility of a Government control of wages - because this would mean control of other factors too - but it went on to suggest that a public disoussion of the basis of wages should be encouraged.   The Industrial Court*s Award in the engineering trade, to which reference has been made, has been of considerable value in this connection, but the Engineering Employers1 Federation has adopted an unfortunate attitude towards it, contending that it is &quot;ultra vires&quot; and made without supporting evidence.   Instead of drawing the obvious*deductions from it, they have intimated that it is unlikely that they will trouble the Court again.   The report of the Dockers1 Court of Inquiry which recommends a rate of 16/- a day (2/- per hour5 for dock labour has already had its effect on the attitude of the Government to the demands of the miners and has given rise to further claims from the railwaymen.   Unless it is made clear at once that the rate has been suggested owing to the abnormal nature of the trade and to the fact that the dockers do not usually work a full week, it will set quite a new wages standard.11.   It seems probable that increases of wages will go on until the supply of labour outruns the demand - in other words, until a finan-cial reaction sets in. It seems impossible to oppose the tendenoies which result in increased wages and it. is perhaps not desirable to attempt it. At bottom these are the result of abnormal war conditions and it is probable that, in the long run, the country will more quickly return to a normal condition if &quot;demand and supply&quot; in regard to labour are allowed to operate freely than if an attempt is made by the State to regulate the one or the other. Certain things, however, might be done to mitigate the effects ofthe
the competition for labour, as seen for instance in the bidding for labcnr which goes on in the building trade, and to encourage generally an increase in production which alone makes an increase in wealth and an increase in real wsges possibleaFor instance, improved organisation of industry should continue to be encouraged, not only with a view to avoiding disputes but also to preventing irregular action on the part of employers in conceding increases of wages without regard to their effect on other parts of the trade or on other trades. 12o Rigid private economy should be encouraged.   The avoidance of unnecessary expenditure will bend to restore the equilibrium betvjeen demand and supply and this will keep down the cost of livingoTrades should be encouraged to follow the lead of the Industrial Court in attempting to get wages settled by reference to the value of the work done for them, and thus to link up wages with productionIt would be advantageous if a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act could be set up in a suitable case where an industry is faced with a demand for increased wages and it is impossible for the demand to be passed on to the consumer0 Fo doubt a ease of this kind will arise in the near future and the Department will take the opportunity to set up a Court0(sdJ ToJomciTAmm.Tth May, 1930, MINISTRY OF lABOUH.
