This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.ADDITIONAL OUTFIT GRANT FOR OFFICERS OF THETERRITORIAL ARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate a memorandum on a proposal to grant an additional outfit allowance of -15/. to Territorial officers who have served during the war and who enter the -re-organized Territorial Army, at an estimated maximum cost of 150,000/.This proposal has been refused by the Treasury, but I am constrained to submit it to the Cabinet as it is intimately connected with successful recruiting for the Territorials; men will not join till they know who are to be their company officers, and company officers are not forthcoming unless the War Office is prepared to protect them against loss in the matter of outfit.In view of criticisms of the War Office in regard to its attitude to the Territorials, and seeing that on the 15th instant the King is to address Lord Lieutenants and Mayors on the subject of the Territorial Army, I would request the Cabinet to give very early and favourable consideration to this proposal for smoothing existing difficulties.It may be added that owing to shortage of recruits, a very considerable under-spending on the Territorial Army is anticipated for the financial year.W. S. C.The War Office,llth May, 1920.Under the Territorial Force Regulations an officer of the Territorial Army is granted an initial outfit allowance on first appointment. This grant is the sole allowance issued for outfit and no additional grant is given during the rest of the officers service. This rule is essentially one for peace conditions, when the amount of wear on the uniform is not considerable and the uniform may be expected to last, without much further expenditure, for the ordinary term of an officers service.The war created a new situation, as the amount of wear on the uniform was naturally out of all proportion to that during peace. As a consequence, many officers, well equipped in the earlier stages, have come out of the war without a presentable uniform and are not in a position to undertake the duties of officers of the Territorial Army without substantial fresh outlay on uniform. Such outlay could not be met by the officers Army pay, which he only draws during the fortnight in camp and during occasional short courses of instruction. The case of a Territorial officer is thus different from that of the Regular Army officer who draws all the year round a rate of pay calculated to provide for keeping up his uniform. Officers cannot be asked to come into the new Territorial Army and render what is practically honorary service without their being given some assistance towards making good the damage which their uniforms have suffered during the war.It is true that many officers must have come out of the war with some serviceable articles of uniform, and officers will be encouraged to use their old service uniforms. For this reason it is not proposed to give the full initial grant.The amount of the initial outfit grant on first appointment which has been submitted to the Treasury is 40/. for Yeomanry and Royal Horse Artillery and 30/. for other arms, and  15/.   has  been  selected as ,the lowest amount which(B20/220)   100  5/20  H&amp;s  8208wo
could be given for the replacement grant. In order to provide against cases where uniform has not had considerable wear under active service conditions, it is proposed to limit this grant to officers who were commissioned at least 6 months before the date of the Armistice and have given at least 12 months&apos; war service. Other limitations have been carefully considered but found impracticable. The total cost is estimated at a maximum of 150,000/.This proposal has been arrived at as the result of many representations received in the course of preparing the scheme of reorganization of the Territorial Force, and the Army Council are satisfied that the question is one which has an important effect on recruiting for the Territorial Army.
