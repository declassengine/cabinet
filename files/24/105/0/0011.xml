III/      1/j &apos;    &apos;this document is the property of his britannic majesty^ government.secret&apos;;the cabinet.gas warfare.memorandum by the secretary of state for war.i circulate herewith a memorandum by the chief of the imperial general staff on gas warfare. i am in entire agreement witli the views put forward by sir henry wilson that gas should be definitely accepted as a weapon of war, and I feel strongly that the indeterminate policy of his majesty&apos;s government on this question, as evinced in the conclusions of the cabinet on 4th march, when final decision was suspended pending reference to the league of nations (cabinet 13 (20), conclusion 3), is placing us at a serious disadvantage, as compared with the other great powers. i hope, therefore, that the matter will receive the early and earnest consideration of my colleagues.w. s. c.The War Office,3rd May, 1920.there exists in this country a prejudice against gas warfare which is seriously affecting our preparedness for war in comparison with other nations.this prejudice is due largely to a misapprehension of facts which i will endeavour to explain. before doing so, however, I would point out that neither the war office, nor the army, nor myself, are by nature favourably disposed towards gas warfare. on the contrary, it is a method of war which is thoroughly foreign to the ordinary soldier\s instinct.my conviction that gas must form part of our military armoury is due to an unwilling conversion, which has come about as a natural result of the knowledge and experience gained since the time we reluctantly employed gas consequent on its introduction by the germans.2. i desire, firstly, to point out that the use of gas in war is a development due to science and invention. it has never been found possible in the past to prevent an effective weapon being used once it has proved its value.the french chivalry at the time of the black prince objected strongly to the use of the british long bow ; the chivalry of all nations in the middle ages raised a violent outcry against the introduction of gunpowder.but in the case of the british empire whose widely extended frontiers have been held in the past not by large numbers of soldiers for their numbers were few but by the superiority of their arms and equipment, a refusal to make use of modern scientific weapons may be fraught with the gravest consequences.the tribes on our frontiers possess to-day quick-firing guns, rifles, and machine guns, and understand how to use them. we have no longer a monopoly of such weapon?, and we must turn to science to help us to maintain our technical superiority.3. secondly, i would call attention to what other nations are doing in the matter. since the war the americans have voted 20,000,000^. for gas warfare, and have actually spent half this sum in one year. this amounts to an actual expenditure 250 times as great as that contemplated by us for the current year (i.e., 52,000/.). it is quite evident that they regard the importance of gas warfare from a standpoint entirely different from our own.   appendix a gives details on this point.we do not know so much of what the french are doing but we know that they are studying the matter very seriously.(B20/193)   100  4/20  H&amp;S   8158wo
The Germans by the possession of their immense dye industries will always be at a great advantage over other nations in this respect, however thoroughly their present gas installations may be destroyed.4. Thirdly, as regards the humanitarian side of gas warfare, J consider that there exists a misapprehension in the common impression that gas is necessarily a dishonourable weapon and that, having denounced the Germans tor using gas in the past, it is illogical for us to want to use it in the future; this argument is untenable, for the German crime lies solely in their breach of faith.The idea that gas is au unusually cruel weapon is an easy matter to disprove conclusively. We must first consider what exactly it is that constitutes a particularly brutal weapon; presumably it is one which, in inflicting the necessary punishment io make an enemy sue for peace, causes an unusually high proportion of deaths, permanent injuries and individual suffering. But British and American statistics confirm each other in showing that only 3 to 4 per cent, of gas casualties die, whereas at least 20 per cent, of other casualties prove fatal.Regarding permanently injured, statistics are naturally harder to obtain, since they depend on different persons&apos; ideas of what constitutes a permanent injury, but there is no doubt whatever of this, that permanent injuries due to gas are much less in proportion than those due to other weapons.Individual suffering is even harder to measure, but in this respect also there can be no doubt that gas is far more merciful than, say, high explosive, lor, quite apart from other considerations, it does not shatter bones, flesh, arteries and nerves; and the very fact that it does not give rise to shell shock and madness is conclusive proof that it is less dreaded by the individual. In point of fact, gas should actually tend to make war distinctly less brutal, for it provides a means of &quot; doping &quot; an opponent and thus putting him hors de. combat while attaining one&apos;s object; in fact, it is a truer conception of modern gases to consider them as drugs rather than as poisons.I appreciate the motives that give rise to the desire to abolish the use of gas in war (illogical though the desire is), and I realize the political expediency of not appearing as pioneers in a form of warfare which was started by the Germans, and which has the reputation of being barbarous, but it is my duty to point out that the existing deadlock will almost certainly involve the sacrifice of large numbers of British lives in any future war in which we may be unfortunate enough to be engaged.5, Meanwhile, our gas organization is threatened with extinction. No expert can be offered continued employment, and, in the circumstances, no scientist of any value is prepared to stay ; a small nucleus still remains, but one by one we are losing them all. The inevitable result will be that in any future war we will again start behindhand in gas warfare, and this time it will be more difficult to excuse our failure.6. I feel, therefore, that, in my position of responsibility as Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos;, 1 should be wanting in my duty to the Army and the Empire if I did not place the greatest emphasis on the following recommendations : (1.) That gas should be definitely accepted as a weapon of war.(2.) That the Governments policy should be to educate public opinion in favour ofthe use of gas as a weapon instead of against it. (3.) That no limits (other than financial) should be placed to our activities instudying and developing gas as a weapon. (4.) That, once at war, the War Office should be empowered to use gas when and where they consider that the military situation demands it.(Sd.)  HENEY WILSON,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.10th April, 1920.
appendix A.iiEITISH  KmBASSY,Washington, D.C.,Uth October, 1919,EXTRACT.Gas Warfare.Major-General William Sibert, Head of the Chemical Warfare Service, when called before the House Committee on Military Affairs, told them that gas is a most humane method of warfare, and that this branch of the military service should be retained. He declared that it was advisable to develop the use of chemicals for aggressive and defensive war by continuous study during times of peace. Future studies should be kept secret and conducted independent of the colleges and universities, with experts at those institutions detailed from time to time to do intensive research for Government.He stated that the trouble of the past came in that Germany agreed not to use it, but did. This is the only country that did not agree. Nations could not be trusted to keep their agreements when their existence was at stake.(Sd.)     H. K. Bethell,Major-General, Military Attache.
