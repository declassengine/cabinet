CABINET, Copy Fo ._WC. P. 1206,RUSSIAN REFUGEES.Mcriorrmdum^by^tho Chan collor.of Jthe Ex oh ft 4uer,1 invite tho attention of the Cabinet to one of very unsatisfactory position and heavy liabilities in regard to the Ru^ian refugee?.So far as Government Departments .in London are aware the number of refugees in British territory or care appears to be about 16,000, distributed between Cyprus, Egypt, Lennos amd Salonioa, but these figure^ are to be taken with the utmost reserve.    In addition there are said, to be 8,000 in Serbia, 8,000 in Bulgaria and a number not specified in Constantinople and Prinkipo.Those in British care comprise no doubt not only those transported under the pledges given &quot;by Sir H. ICaokinderand Kr* Lowden but any others who succeeded in getting by whatever pretext on to British &quot;hips.The Government have agreed to  ^0,000 from the final instalment to uenikin being giv^n to the Red Cross Society for their relief, and the Eoreign Office have al*o instructed Admiral de Robe ok that he may spend on the same 0 bleat a sum of  10,000 from the Foreign Office Votes.   The Cabinet have at no time agree to the maintenance for an indefinite time of the refugees *The fact, however, remains that they are on hur hands, whether or not local officer^ have gone beyond instructions in accepting them.   Being on our hand^ they cannot be allowed to starve and unless early ant ion is taken they will probably cost us a large amount for maintenance,   A moderate estimate would apparently be for food, alone a  1 a week a. head - say  ^0;000 - 60,000 a month.     In addition there is the cost of adninistratic and transport.   The 00 &quot;t &apos;.of coal and oil supplied &quot;by tho Admiral! under Cabinet doois,ion for flour mills and ships is stated to bo .
 32,000 a wo ok up to tho fall of Rovoroosi^k and . 27,000 a &quot;re olc tho re aft or ,Representatives of Government &quot;Departmentn mot on tho 27th instant, two Russian representative&apos;-:, H, Sabline of the Russian 1&apos;ilmbaeny and ]r, do 3ahm.cn, the Russian financial agent,   These gentlemen unfolded r r,oh&apos;v/-p for the appoint-ment of a representative Russian Committee.in London who would be prepared to undertake the or.ro of the rnfu&amp;*fis, utilising funds at their die -csal.   They have eomo  15*0,000 oon^i^ting of General Leni.ltin&apos;e silver at Constantinople, and they hope to raise further susis by tho sale of Rut.ian ship0 of war now in this country and by other means.   Their idea is to concentrate the refugees if possible in Serbia and find them work there.    They seemed to think the Serbian Government might not be unwilling if reassured as to coet of maintenance.   This appears to be the most hopeful soli erne before the Government and I trust it may be possible to carry it through at an early date,Ao regards the Allies, the UYSvA. have refused/to give any assistance;    the Italians confine their assistance to some roliof st Constantinople: the Trenoh have offered to provide 11,000,000 franon under conditions not olearly defined, but apparently conditionally on our providing an equal sum and oh the constitution of an Inter-Ally 0 inanimation.There are no Votes of Parliament which provide funds for the contingency which has arisen and II am advised that Parliamentary authority in required for.the expenditure. The cash is at present be ins: found from Army &quot;Fund n in the main.(Initialled)   A, CcTreasury, S.T,I-, Kay 3rd.&apos;,, 1920.
