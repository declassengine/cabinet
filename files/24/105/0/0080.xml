General. Nil.Part II. Departmental.The Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme.The Government scheme for the resumption of apprenticeship interrupted by war service may now be considered as fully developed. It has not been foimd necessary during the past three months to add to the 40 schemes for separate industries which had then been negotiated, although the scope of the general scheme, applicable at the discretion of the Minister to trades for which no special arrangements were considered desirable, is still open to enlargement. Some slight falling off may already be detected in the rate at which applications from apprentices are received. But the number received weekly is still large, despite the decline during the past months in the rate of demobilisation. This, no doubt, is largely due to the fact that apprentices on account of their age or of their occupation in war industries were taken into the army only at a late stage. But a secondary cause operating to some extent lies in the necessity for reminding both apprentices and employers of the existence and advantages of the scheme, which continues to involve a very considerable amount of work. During the thirteen weeks ending the 26th April, applications have been received at an average weekly rate nearly reaching 650, and the total number which had been received by that date was close upon 43,000, an increase of over(0 1996)  150  5/20 H &amp; S 2 E[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]
8,300 since the 26th January. Grants had been sanctioned in over 34,950 cases by the 5th May, as against nearly 26,400 cases by the 4th February. Over 13,900 employers have apprentices working with them under the apprenticeship scheme. In very few cases has it been necessary to refuse grants, the total number of such cases for the whole of the period of the operation of the scheme only slightly exceeding 1,200. A considerable number of apprentices have already completed their training under the scheme, some 4,830 agreemen bs having run their course by the 5th May. This number, however, includes a small proportio l of cases in which the apprenticeship was terminated by mutual consent of the employe: and the apprentice. Some difficulty is still found in placing in training apprentices wb ) cannot return to their pre-war employers, but the proportion of these cases is small. ()nly a little over 5,000 of the 43,000 apprentices who have made application have found it necessary to turn to new employers, and of these only a little more than half had not found employers to accept them when they made application to the department for assistance.The trade unions have shown their approval of the scheme in a marked degree. Great assistance has been rendered in many cases in bringing apprentices under the scheme. The term &quot; apprenticeship &quot; has been interpreted in the broad spirit in which the scheme was drawn up, and the attitude of the unionists to apprentices actually in &quot;training has in general been all that could be desired. The main quarter from which objection continues to be taken to the operation of the scheme still lies in Scotland, where trouble is still found with some of the employers in the building trades. Here, the difficulties which resulted some months ago in a strike of joiners to compel the master joiners to accept the scheme, were followed during March by a similar strike in the plumbing trade. Direct action was resorted to on the first instance in Glasgow on the 24th February, when the employees were withdrawn from the four principal firms in the city. On the 1st March the employers&apos; association replied by a general lock-out in the city. The intervention of the department and of the Joint Industrial Council for the Building Industry brought about a settlement of the strike on the 8th March. The employers recommended to their association the full acceptance of the interrupted apprenticeship scheme as from the 1st June, 1919, and the payment of arrears consequently due to the apprentices. It was hoped that the settlement in Glasgow would induce the master plumbers elsewhere in Scotland to accept the scheme, but this was not the case in Edinburgh. In spite of the efforts of the depart-ment, the employers refused to accept the scheme as it stood, and a strike consequently took place on the 3rd April which has involved 700 plumbers in Edinburgh and Leith and still continues. Conferences are being held and it is hoped that the strike will soon be settled. The main objection of the employers to the scheme is to the insistence on retrospective payment.In other directions the general outlook is favourable. In outlying areas where the rates for journeymen are low, some employers still feel unable to bring their apprentices under the scheme in view of the unfavourable comparison between the earnings of the apprentices and the journeymen which would result. But, as a rule, there has been no more serious difficulty than a certain amount of inertia. Already close on 12,600 appren-tices have been provided for in the engineering industry, over 5,900 in the building trades, not far short of 5,000 in the printing trades in England and Scotland, some 1,850 in ship-building, and over 1,350 in the furniture trades. In other trades, the numbers, though smaller, have usually reached a quite satisfactory level.Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press.The Socialist Movement.General articles upon the May Day demonstrations appear in the &quot;Nation&quot; and in the &quot; Clarion.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; reviews the celebrations in an ambulatory manner. The two main impressions which the &quot; Nation &quot; conveys to its readers in this article are that the condition of the people has improved greatly in recent years (&quot; Poverty has almost come to an end &quot;) and that the danger to the Labour Party under present cir-cumstances lies not only in its inexperience of politics and diplomacy, but in the general vagueness of its outlook upon fundamental matters of principle. As an example of this vagueness the &quot; Nation &quot; asks whether the Labour Party means to apply itself to see the existing society through its trouble on to a revised order or whether it intends to withhold its support in order to bring the fabric of existing society more speedily to the ground.
* Of this Report below, p. 223. (C 1996)t Of. this Report below, p. 224.In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson discusses the May Day resolutions in a very critical spirit. In answer to the extremists who talked about revolution on May Day, he insists that political action is all that is needed to carry into effect the greater part of the May Day resolutions. He takes this opportunity to attribute to the continuous agitation for direct action by the extremists the recent setbacks with which the Labour candidates have met in by-elections. &quot; The Call &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; discuss in particular the part taken by the co-operative movement in the May Day meetings. &quot; The Call&quot; complains that the entry of the co-operators into these Labour demonstrations may considerably weaken the spirit and moral of the Labour movement. &quot; The co-operators are still largely in the small shop-keeper state of mind.&quot; The particular complaints of &quot; The Call &quot; are, of course, that the co-operators succeeded in deleting from the Hyde Park resolution a proposal to send greetings to the Third International, and apparently also that they forestalled an attempt by the B.S.P. to use the Albert Hall gathering for purposes of B.S.P. propaganda. &quot; Justice &quot; calls attention to the fact that the co-operative meeting at the Albert Hall was addressed by such people as Mr. Lansbury, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst and Mr. Tom Mann. This paper points out that it has taken years of work on the part of socialists inside the co-operative movement to get co-operators to advance even as far as they have now done. This paper fears that &quot; platform attempts to stampede them into something uhey do not understand and with which they have little sympathy &quot; will hinder and neutralise this steady socialist educational work in the co-operative movements&apos; The question of Communist unity, as was the case in last week&apos;s papers, is discussed mainly by the &quot; Socialist,&quot; the deep interest of this paper in this question arising from the facts that a split has commenced in the Socialist Labour Party and that a minority is leaving this Party owing to its intransigeant attitude in the negotiations between the extreme socialist bodies in order to form a united Communist Party. The principal article on this question is one which purports to be a discussion of local government. The purpose of the article is to show that Labour and Socialist members of local au-thorities are doing nothing to aid the revolution, but, on the other hand, are helping to maintain the capitalist system in working order. Correspondence is also given from Mr. J. T. Murphy dated the 20th April, 1920. Mr. Murphy spends the main part of his time attacking the British Socialist Party on the ground that not only in its relation to the Labour Party but also in its relation to the trade union movement, it is essentially reformist in character.The most important remarks with regard to the position of the LLP. are made by Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; Mr. Snowden refers to the fact that the invitation to the Geneva Conference of the Second International which is to be held in July, asks not only those socialist bodies affiliated to the International, but all other sections who are animated with a desire for international socialist unity on the basis of general socialist principles.! Mr. Snowden states that most socialist parties, and in particular the French parties, are reported to be considering the question of sending such consultative delegates, and it is easy to see that the headquarters of the I.L.P. will be strongly tempted, in spite of the decision of their annual conference at Easter to sever all connection with the Second International, to take such action : &quot; pharisaical righteousness which stands in the way of possible unity deserves condemnation.&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden also returns to his criticism of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He thinks that there has undoubtedly been an arrest in recent weeks of the movement of the electorate towards the Labour Party. He insists that the parliamentary party has it in its power to alter this and revive the belief that the hope of democracy lies in the Labour movement.Trade Union Movement.The &quot; work to rule &quot; or &quot; slow gear &quot; movement among railway men is noticed in many papers. The &quot; Railway Review &quot; deals in a leading article with discontent among the rank and file of the N.U.R. with the recent railway settlement. It is suggested that many of the complaints result from jealousy among the various grades of railway workers within the N.U.R., and that some men &quot; are not satisfied, with equality but desire a perpetuation of inequality.&quot; It is laid down that the great principle of the N.U.R. is the principle of standardisation, of equal pay for the same work. The discontented members of the union are asked &quot; to realise that when they enter their trade union they cease to be competitors with their fellow workers and must learn to be co-operators instead.&quot; Very similar remarks are made by the trade union correspondent of the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; who hints that it is a deliberate policy of the railway companies
to create such jealousy. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; condemns the &quot; slow gear &quot; movement on different grounds. He states that congestion on the railways is in no inconsiderable measure responsible for present high prices, and Mr. Snowden believes that increased production is the key to the problem of high prices. He declares, therefore, that any course of action which interferes either with the flow of production or the circulation of commodities must greatly aggravate the high price situation. He asks the railwaymen, if they have a case for a further advance of wages, to fight the matter out in an hones!: and straightforward way. The trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is also critical of this movement, but on quite other grounds. He is not troubled by the effect tl is policy may have on production : he has much sympathy with the men who are &quot; working to rule &quot; because he believes that the adoption of this policy results from their feelhig that no railwaymen&apos;s strike will be allowed by the Government to be successful. Nevertheless, he is of opinion that this policy is a mild example of sabotage, and he condemns sabotage as &quot; a tactic of defeat.&quot;The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals in a special article with the report on &quot; Profit Sharing and Labour Co-partnership &quot; prepared by the Intelligence and Statistics Department of the Ministry of Labour. The article, as might be expected from this paper, is very critical of profit sharing schemes. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; passes from a discussion of the report itself to a consideration of profit sharing between employers and employees by industries. It regards the Duckham Scheme for the Mining Industry as of this type, and the arguments advanced by the cotton operatives in support of their claim for increased wages are also treated as involving this profit sharing by industries. This form of profit sharing is condemned from the point of view of the community and the consumer as tending towards a &quot; conspiracy between the workers and the employers to share the swag.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; looks forward to a &quot; better distribution of the national income according to need,&quot; and naturally is hostile to any determination of wages by the current profits being made in the various industries. In mentioning only the cotton textile and the coal industries in this connection, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; conveys the impression that it considerably underestimates the extent to which this principle at present is being regarded as a fundamental factor in determining wages.Government Policy.The principal criticisms of Government policy in the papers dealt with this week relate to the Budget and the housing policy of the Government. The question of high prices is discussed, but not with regard to Government measures. Mr. F. Pethick Law-rencc discusses the Budget in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and his criticism is notable for a new method of classifying taxation. The first criticism made in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; of the Budget was that too great a proportion of the new taxation was indirect. This argument was so obviously untenable that it has not been pursued any further in the Labour and Socialist press. Mr. Pethick Lawrence classifies the new taxation under three heads, namely, taxation of the working classes, taxation of industry and taxation of wealth.. Under the second head he includes the excess profits duty and the proposed corporation tax, and he estimates that of the new taxation 150 millions will fall on industry and 40 millions on the working classes, but only 10 millions on wealth. Mr. Lawrence&apos;s complaint against taxation of industry is that it will send up prices all the way round, and the novel point, for the Labour and Socialist press, is that he regards this taxation as being quite as bad as indirect taxation of the working classes.The speech by the Lord Privy Seal at the Guildhall on Monday, 3rd inst., in support of the housing bond campaign, receives attention in practically all papers. The &quot; Democrat&quot; is the only paper that is at all optimistic as to the value of the campaign. The preponderating opinion is that the campaign will utterly fail to provide the necessary money for housing schemes. The I.L.P. papers are especially severe in their criticism of the Government in this matter, but are not remarkable for the sanity or practicability of their suggestions. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;thinks that if only the financial difficulty were overcome the &quot;war-time miracles of production could be repeated, &quot;and favourable reference is made to the hutments constructed during the war for the War Departments. Mr. Philip Snowden suggests that should the housing bond campaign fail, the Government should either levy forced loans at low rates of interest or should make interest-free loans to local authorities out of national funds raised by taxation. The remedy favoured by the &quot; New Statesman&quot; is the encouragement by the Ministry of Health of the experiments in the use of direct labour by local authorities, and of so-called building guilds. This paper, too, suggests that the housing schemes might be financed out of taxation. It admits that the operatives available fall short by tens of thousands of the number required, but
Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The most important feature of the week under review has been the settlements of important wage disputes without recourse to actual strike action. The industries affected are the Cotton Textile Industry and the Sheffield Iron and Steel Industry. The formal signature of the agreement between the National Transport Workers Federation and the Provisional National Council of Port Labour Employers is also a notable event.(C 1996) 2 E 3believes with excessive optimism that an assurance by the Government to the trade unions with regard to working conditions would solve the labour problem. The main suggestion of the &quot; Nation &quot; is that the State should take land at agricultural prices and initiate garden city schemes so as to retain the &quot; unearned increment &quot; for the liquidation of the building debt. The &quot; New Age &quot; is the only paper to refer to the control of so-called luxury building operations under the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919. This paper argues that unless the Government increases the amount of money available for working-class housing schemes, the stopping of luxury building under this Act will only cause unemployment. To the &quot; New Age &quot; the only effect of orders under this Act will be to cheapen very slightly the prices of building materials. In the opinion of this paper, of course, the key to a right understanding of economic and social conditions lies in the realisation of the importance of the distribution of purchasing power.The cost of living question is again the principal topic of discussion in the &quot; New Age,&quot; but this paper directs its criticism not so much against the Government but against the official leaders of the Labour movement for not realising with sufficient intensity the fundamental importance of this question. Similarly, a discussion by Mrs. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Pioneer,&quot; on this question deals mainly with the way in which women may increase production. Mrs. Snowden shares her husband&apos;s opinion that the key to a solution of the problem of high prices lies in the production of more goods, and mainly for export. Mrs. Snowden, however, also suggests the formation of women&apos;s leagues to fight profiteering by retail and wholesale distributors.Foreign Affairs.The proceedings of the San Remo conference excite fairly general attention in the Labour and Socialist press. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; shares the opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; last week that the good genius of the conference was the Italian Prime Minister. The proceedings of the conference are generally approved by Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and by &quot; Rob Roy &quot; and Mr. Macdonald in &quot; Forward.&quot; Mr. Snowden and Mr. Macdonald are both pleased with the decision to invite the repre-sentatives of the German Government to meet the allied Prime Ministers at Spa. The leading article in &quot; The Times,&quot; of Wednesday the 5th inst., however, appears to have influenced the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New Statesman.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; complains bitterly that the Prime Minister is making a deliberate attempt to make permanent the Supreme Allied Council and to &quot; force or shuffle the League of Nations off the European stage.&quot; It is noteworthy that &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; also suggests that the Supreme Allied Council is nearing the end of its labours and should soon give place to the League of Nations. In connection with the widely held opinion in Labour circles that the appli-cation of the principle of self-determination to Ireland is a comparatively easy matter, it is interesting to note that &quot;Rob Roy &quot; refers to the experience of plebiscites gained in Schleswig-Holstein as not enhancing the reputation of the plebiscite method as a political measure in the very cases where it is most likely to be applied.The Polish offensive against the Soviet Republic creates wide interest in the more extreme papers and the &quot; Nation.&quot; The general hope, however, is that the Soviet Govern-ment will succeed in repelling the Polish attacks. The Labour Party delegation to Russia is noticed by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, who fears that it is too numerous to investigate the Russian situation properly, and too miscellaneous in character to concentrate its mind upon the definite points which are in doubt. The situation in France does not receive much attention in the papers reviewed, and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; is content to suggest that the Confederation Generate du Travail is moving towards a policy closely resembling that of British miners, railwaymen and postal workers. This paper comforts itself with the belief that French trade unionism has abandoned its old demand for a purely catastrophic change, and is adopting the British programme of joint control by workers, consumers and the public.
Two features in the industrial situation at the close of the week may be mentioned. There is a certain amount of trouble in the building trade in various parts of the country arising partly from the putting into operation of the 44-hour week, and partly horn discontent with the grading of towns under the various area agreements. A meeting of the National Board of Conciliation for the Building Trades is to be held on the 12th inst. to deal with the general situation. The second matter is that the strike of the employees of Messrs. Joha Lewis and Company continues, and sympathetic action in support of the strikers ha; been officially taken by the N.U.R. It is reported that other trade unions are considering similar action.The meeting of the Triple Alliance on the 6th inst. is dealt with below. It may be noted here that the increase in the price of coal used for household and allied purposes announced by the President of the Board of Trade on the 10th inst., though it had been anticipated for some time, is arousing strong opposition from miners&apos; leaders and the Labour Party.The Unemployment Position.The decrease in the number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged for the week ended the 30th April, 1920, was 1,955 compared with an increase of 763 between the 16th April and the 23rd April. The number of II.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 30th April was 219,226, composed of 217,186 by men and 2,040 by women.67,255 unemployment books (43,685 by males and 23,570 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 30th April, 1920, making a reduction of 2,198 since the 23rd April. At the latter date there were 45,549 books lodged ,by males and 23,904 by females (a total of 69,453).At the 23rd April, 132 policies remained lodged by short-time workers, of which 82 were in the insured industries (87 - 8 per cent, being in the Engineering and Ironfounding Group) and 50 in the uninsured. At the previous week, ending the 16th April, there were 141 short-time policies remaining lodged, and 260 a month ago.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges for the week ended the 30th April, 1920, was 276,939 men, 48,976 women, 25,406 juveniles compared with 282,369 men, 49,158 women, 26,291 juveniles, a week ago (the 23rd April) and 290,472 men, 47,382 women, 21,492 juveniles a month ago.Triple Alliance.An important meeting of the full executives of the constituent bodies of the Triple Alliance was held on the 6th. May at Unity House. The consultative sub-committee, consisting of the presidents and secretaries of the constituent bodies, which had been instructed to enquire into the speeding up of the machinery of the Alliance, reported that it had completed its proposals with a view to securing that the Alliance might more effectively serve the purpose for which it was. originally intended. These proposals, which made provision for more frequent meetings both of the full executives and of the consultative sub-committee, were approved. The primary purpose of the meeting was to consider a proposal of the National Union of Railwaymen that consideration should be given to the broadening of the basis of the Alliance for the purpose of bringing in other unions. This proposal was fully considered, and it was resolved that no occasion had yet arisen for such an extension, as the Alliance felt that it could most effectively accomplish the purpose for which it was created on its present basis. It is reported that the two unions whose entry was being considered, although, no formal application had been made, were the new Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Union of Post Office Workers. There appears, however, to be a strong view in the Alliance that it is already large enough to secure its ends and that any increase in its membership would merely make it unwieldy without adding to its bargaining power or other influence. According to the official report of the meeting, the Alliance devoted the major part of its time to a consideration of the high cost of living, and a proposal was made to call upon the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Movement, to join with it in making an exhaustive enquiry into the reasons for the high cost of living and to evolve a plan for its reduction to be submitted to the Government by the joint body as soon as possible. A further meeting of the Alliance will take place at an early date to receive the report of the result of this effort.Scottish Trades Union Congress.At the annual meeting of this congress, resolutions were passed in favour of .an amendment to the Workrnen&apos;s Compensation Act, so that the maximum amount payable
in cases of fatal accident should be increased to  500 for a widow and  75 for each other dependant; welcoming the relations developing between the Co-operative Societies and the Labour movement, and urging all Trade Unionists to become members of Co-operative Societies. It was also agreed to put forward a demand that wages should be paid during holidays, and the congress decided to declare itself in favour of a 44-hour week. In the course of the proceedings, Mr. G. II. Stuart-Bunning made an interesting statement on behalf of the League of Nations Union. He pointed out that the only part of the League of Nations that had done any constructive work was that associated with Labour, and he maintained that for the future Labour could provide the real driving force behind the League of Nations.Co-operative Movement and the Labour Party.Certain cases have recently been reported in which local co-operative societies have objected to the close alliance which shows signs of developing through Trade Unionism between the Co-operative and Socialist Movements. At a meeting of the United Board of the Co-operative Union recently, objection was taken by some of the representatives to the extremist statements which had been made at May Day demonstrations, for the organisation of which co-operative societies were partly responsible, and it was announced that a large society in Lancashire had deferred making a grant of  300 towards the Co-operative Parliamentary funds as a protest against what had occurred at these demonstra-tions. It is also reported that the Peterborough Co-operative Society has rescinded a resolution passed in February to affiliate with the Labour Party.National Union of Scottish Mine Workers.The annual conference of this body commenced at Stirling on the 5th May and concluded on the 7th. A resolution was unanimously adopted in favour of taking immediate steps to secure a minimum wage of  5 10s. for miners. A resolution was also carried calling upon the Miners&apos; Federation of Great. Britain to urge the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to convene a national conference to consider the fixing of a minimum wage for all workers to bring them above the poverty line as laid down by Sir Leo Money. A resolution was also carried by a large majority in favour of the policy of a 5-day week throughout the Scottish coalfield. It was decided unanimously to request the Trades Union Congress to act in conjunction with the co-operative societies for the purpose of feeding workers during strikes, and that a conference should take place between the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society for the purpose of establishing facilities for banking. An emergency resolution was carried repudiating the statement that the price of coal for industrial and domestic uses must be largely increased owing to the recent advance in miners&apos; wages. The resolution called upon the M.F.G.B., if any further advance in prices took place, to claim a further increase in wages equal to such an advance in price. Mr. John Robertson, M.P., resigned his presidency of the union in order to give more time to his Parliamentary duties, and Mr. Hugh Murnin (Stirlingshire miners&apos; agent) was elected president.National Guilds League.The annual meeting of this body was held in London on the 8th and 9th May. A resolution was carried by a majority asserting that the firm establishment of Guild Socialism was impossible without the supersession of the administrative and coercive machinery of the capitalist state by, forms of organisation created by, and directly expressing the will of. the workers themselves. The resolution welcomed the Soviet system as complying with this condition, and affirmed the solidarity of the conference with the Russian Soviet Republic. Resolutions were carried against schemes of nationalisation likely to hinder the development of the full measure of guild autonomy, special reference being made to the decision of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to accept the proposals of the Sankey Report. It was decided to urge Trade Unions in other industries to follow the example of the Manchester Building Trades Unions in their experiment conducted by the Building Guild Committee.Amalgamation.It is reported that there is a growing feeling among officials in the woollen textile industry in favour of the amalgamation of the unions in the industry. This feeling is reported to be especially strong in the Huddersfield district where resolutions have been passed by local branches of the General Union of Textile Workers and the National Society
of Dyers and Finishers, urging their union executives to prepare a scheme for the con-sideration of the members. The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress directs the attention of the British Trades Union Congress to the fact that two unions for seamen, namely, the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union and the British Seafarers&apos; Union, are operating in Glasgow, and asks that a meeting of the two unions should be convened to consider amalgamation. On a ballot vote of 3,416 against 179, the Federated Council of Government Employees has decided to amalgamate with the National Union of General Workers.Trade Union Topics.North Wales Quarrymen&apos;s Union. At the annual meeting of this union a resolution was passed calling upon the Government to effect a substantial reduction in the cost of living.   This resolution was forwarded for action to the Trades Union Congress.Metalliferous Miners&apos; Union. Mr. D. Gilmour (President of this Union), stated at St. Just on the 5th May, that the industrial revival of the Cornwall tin mines on economic lines was out of the question. A living wage could only be paid either by direct State subsidy or by fixing a duty on all imported tin sufficient to provide the home workers with a living wage. This union has been newly formed to organise non-ferrous metal miners, and its organisers (who are closely connected with the National Democratic Party) have recently been very active in the Cornish mining district.Amalgamated Engineering Union.-r\Aie conference of representatives of the various unions amalgamating in this union concluded at York on the 1st May after a session of five days. The rules submitted by the Rules Committee were unanimously approved. Provision is to be made to bring the rank and. file more directly into touch with the executive by annual conferences.British Merchant Service League. This League has been registered as a Trade Union.Unemployment Insurance Bill.Resolutions from Trade Union branches continue to be passed protesting against the administration of unemployment benefit by friendly societies. On the other hand, at the annual meeting of the Northern. Counties Clerks Provident Association, held at Newcastle on the 6th May, a resolution was carried unanimously endorsing the action of the national conference of friendly societies urging the claim of all approved societies under the Health Insurance Acts to take part in the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.High Prices.A series of resolutions from local Trade Union branches have been reported in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; demanding that a special Trades Union Congress should be called in order to formulate a policy for the whole trade union movement designed to bring about a reduction in the cost of living.   (See also p. 222.)International Relations.Second International. It is reported that the Austrian Social Democratic Party has declined the invitation to participate in. the Congress of the Second International at Geneva on the 31st July on. the ground that the Geneva conference is not an effective instrument to re-create a unified international, and that no international socialist congress, can be effective if it is ignored by the proletariat of France and Italy.Third International-It is reported that the new German Communist group, formed at the time of the Kapp coup d&apos;etat from Spartacist and Independent Socialist elements, has been expelled from the Third International, firstly, because of its complicity in the recent so-called &quot;Kapp intrigue&quot; and its willingness to co-operate with the Junkers, and, secondly, because of its advocacy of any and every means, including terrorism and violence to prisoners.International Congress of ex-Service Men. The International Congress of ex-Service Men opened at Geneva on the 1st May under the presidency of M. Henri Barbusse. Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Austria were represented. Great Britain was represented by Mr. A. E. Mander and Mr. Alex. Scott, delegates of the National Union of ex-Service Men. Under the terms of a charter which was adopted, the International League of ex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations undertakes to carry on an intensive pacifist
and anti-militarist propaganda in all countries. It condemns the League of Nations as a League of capitalist Governments. M. Henri Barbusse was elected General Secretary, and Messrs. Scott and Mander members of the council.Forthcoming International Labour Conferences. A very large number of International Labour, Conferences will take place in the next few months. The most important of these is, of course, the conference with regard to seamen organised by the International Labour Office, which will begin at Genoa on the 15th June. In addition to this conference, several congresses of international federations of trade unions will take place shortly. Among these may be noted the International Congress of Miners which will be held on the 2nd August at Geneva, will consider certain modifications in the existing rules and constitution of the International Federation of Miners, and will also be concerned with the question of nationalisation of the mines, and the improvement of wages and working conditions.* Conferences of seamen organised by the International Seamen&apos;s Association will also take place at Genoa commencing on the 10th June.

An international congress of post office workers is to be held at Milan in June. It may be noted also that an International Congress of Women will take place in Geneva in. June.The French Government and the Confederation Generale du Travail.The policy of direct action which has recently been debated by the British Labour movement in connection with the mines nationalisation campaign is being put to the practical test in France on a similar issue.   The movement began with a general strike of the National Federation of Bailwaynien on the 1st May for the nationalisation of railways and the redress of various grievances which were the aftermath of the previous strike.f  On the 2nd May the C.G.T. took over the strike, called out the miners, dockers and seamen in support, published a general economic programme for national and inter-national application, and publicly announced that it was acting on behalf of the community in consequence of the Government^ failure to reduce the cost of living.   It followed this up with an offer to discuss with the Government the specific demands of the railwaymen, the miners, the dockers and the seamen for the reorganisation of their respective industries on the lines of the recently-issued report of the Conseil Economique du Travail on &quot; indus-trialised nationalisation.&quot;   The Government met the situation by refusing to negotiate until work was resumed, and stating that as the time was passed for conference, it would introduce its own measures of social legislation, including proposals for the reorganisation of the railways through the normal political channels.  Essential services have been maintained partly with the help of volunteers, prominent leaders have been arrested on the charge of plotting against the internal safety of the State, and local extremists have been weeded out by dismissals from their posts.  In order to force a decision the C.G.T., while strictly confining the movement to the declared object of the strike, called out on the 10th the metal workers, builders, transport workers and carriage and aeroplane workers, and on the llth the electricians.  The Socialist party has identified itself officially with the movement, the National Council calling upon all Socialists to conform, strictly to the order of the C.G.T., to which it ascribed sole responsibility for the direction of the industrial movement.The French Government, on the llth, announced that it would take judicial proceedings for the dissolution of the C.G.T. under the Waldeck-Rousseau Law of 1884, which legalises the existence of French trade unions. This law strictly defines the purpose of trade unions by sanctioning their formation for the defence of economic interests, whether in industry, commerce or agriculture, and limits federations of trade unions to the barest rights of mere association. M. Millerand charges the C.G.T. with interfering with the economic life of the country at a time when France has vital need of work and production, not in order* Of. this Report, May 5th, p. 210 (Mr. Hodges&apos; article in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;) t Of. this Report, March 3rd, p. 134.
to safeguard professional interests but with an avowedly political object. The Govern-ment, he states, has no intention of interfering with the rights of trade unionism, but, it is determined to prevent the C.G.T. setting itself up as a power against the recognised, political authorities and to bring it under the laws of the Republic.T.
