This Document Is tho Property4 of 323His Bri^r^^ys Government. ^  y^/Circulated by the^ecretary of State for India.SECRET. ,i5^     liL^^^^o papers have been circulated to the Cabinet the tendency of which is contradictory.   One is a memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial . General Staff urging that &quot;gas should be definitely accepted as a weapon^CPljLM of war&quot; and drawing the logical conclusions from that proposition^ The i other is a draft note to the League of Nations stating that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment &quot; hold the view that this new method oL: warfare ought never to c have been employed, and they would rejoice to see it put an end to,&quot; and^ $ (J.P. 12J**&apos; inviting early consideration of the question by the Council of the/League, r We are thus faced by the necessity of a momentous decision. By publicly putting forward the latter document we shall debar ourselves for ever from using the arguments upon which the former is based. For that reason, if for no other, I hope that my colleagues will approve Sir i\i. Hankey&apos;s draft.I do not propose to discuss the general question of the morality and humanity of the use of gas by the British Army in Europe. But as regards the Army in India (which is not under the War Office, but under the Government of India, subject to the general control of the Secretary of State in Council), I am, as at present advised, entirely opposed to its use against the frontier tribesmen or the Afghans, except as a measure of retaliation. However much better these people may now be armed, I do not think it can be argued that the unprovoked use of gas against them is a military neces-sity. It may be an advantage, but against it must be set what I cannot help regarding as a far greater disadvantage. Our clean methods of lighting and our humanity to prisoners of war in these regions in the past have bred, a certain measure of humanity in the enemy, and our higher standards of conduct have tended to raise those of our uncivilised neighbours. Apart altogether from altruistic motives, it is we who benefit by this improvement, since we wish to live on friendly terms with these neighbours, and may even have to bring them under our rule. There can be little doubt in what light Indian opinion will regard the unprovoked use of gas, both in general and by ourselves in particular, after our violent denunciations of its use by the Germans ; and I have no hesitation in saying that if we have recourse to it we shall lower our moral prestige both in India and on the frontier, and, wherever we use it, leave behind a heritage of resentment and revengefulness from which we ourselves shall be the first to suffer.The Government of India, it is true, have expressed themselves in favour of gas warfare; but the views which I am now putting forward represent the considered opinion of my military advisers in this country  officers who have had experience of the use of gas both on western and eastern fronts.For these reasons, while I recognise the necessity for the study of gas warfare in India, and have already given directions to the Government of India to prosecute it on a limited scale and in an unobtrusive manner, I trust that, my colleagues will, so far as India is concerned, reject the first three recommendations of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and modify the fourth by leaving it to the Secretary of State for India to decide whether in any particular Indian operations the use of gas is warranted by the circumstances.E. S. M. -12th May 1920.Mil
