H 15SUMMARYThe May Day celebrations passed off without disturbances.   In the provinces, except in Glasgow, the demonstrations were unimpor-tant; in London the number who took part in the procession and demonstration8 was imposing, but there was a preponderance of women anu children; it was made the occasion for an advertisement of the Cooperative Societies and of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.The &quot;working to Rule Book&quot; strike of the London railwaymen has produced,congestion at Paddington and King&apos;s Cross, where the men are refusing to work overtime, but it has generally failed through-out the country.The Liverpool dock strike in sympathy with the Sinn Fein prisoners was a failure.The unrest caused fcy high prices is not decreasing; indeed, it is spreading among the women.There is a growing antagonism between the Sinn Fein demonstrators in England and the rank and file of English labour; so marked is it in London that the demonstrations outside Wormwood Scrubs Prison have been called off.   There are threats, however, that they will shortly be resumed, on a date to be given in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;^ and that the Sinn Fein demonstrators will be armed.Despite the rising cost of paper, there has been a remarkable increase in the output and sale of Socialist literature.The formation of the new Communist Party   in England still tarries.Attention/
Attention is called to the opinions of working men, taken at random, on the subject of revolutionary agitation.The maohinery of the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; will be reviewed at a meeting of the three Executives to-day.
MAY DAY&apos; ,im i ,   &apos;  .1 . ji &apos; -i-rtTin I)As far as disorder went the celebrations passed off H remarkably well.   As I anticipated last week the celebrationsin London were on a larger soale than ever before but in the provinces they were of negligible importance.   The workers generally were more anxious to enjoy a holiday, for which they were dressed, than to listen to Socialism, and tho preponderance of the Co-operative..influence mitigated the efforts of tho revolutionaries.The procession in London was in effect a gigantic advertisement for the Co-operative Societies and a lesser one for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   Tho latter must have realised a considerable sum by the sale of flags although the paper itself was given.away.   Socialistic literature was much in evidence, but more than one seller refused,to work having &quot;conscientious objections&quot; against labour on. May Day. ... .     The demonstration,.in Hyde Park was the largest over held in London, but the attendance was. not as great as had been hoped by the &quot;Reds&quot; since at the most 50,000 people were present and two thirds of these were women and children; there are about 750,000 organised Trade.Unionists in London. At the same time, the number proved that $he various revolutionary organisations are making considerable headway in the. London area.There wore twelve platforms and the better-known speakers included George Bolt, H. T. Macdonald and R.W. Fox (Herald League); -Councillors J. J. Vaugftan, and A. A. Watts (London County Council); D. Carmichael . (London. Trades Council); P. Willis, J. P. Hodgson   (British Socialist Party); James Cash   (National Union of Ex-service  Men); W.T.A. Foot (National Union of Railwayman); J. Hayes (National Union of Police and Prison Officers); Rev. E. Swann (Church SocialistLeague/
League); B. Unwin (University Socialist Party); Mrs. Dora Montefiore and Mrs. Despard.Although most of the speakers are pronounced extremistsi:the speeches were more moderate than might have been expeoted It waB the general comment among the crowd, however, that the moderate leaders would not have obtained a hearing.The predominant note of the speeches was eulogy of the Russian Soviets; in one case this provoked opposition and the interrupter, having been invited to the platform, roundly abused the Bolsheviks and elicited cheers from his audience.The resolution passed was substantially as forecast in my report No. 48 of 30.3.20.   Appeals for money to pay printing expenses are said to have met with a&apos;ready response.The Albert Hall audience of about 8,000 had paid Is. 3d, each for real revolutionary thrills and the mild speeches of the two co-operators were given short shrift.   Mr. Tom Mann&apos;s appeal to his hearers to shed their patriotism created the desired alien atmosphere.   His denunciation of the State and established order was unexcelled even in his own records. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst dealt almost exclusively with Russia and put forward an impromptu resolution supporting Soviets in Britain, which was passed by a show of hands.The real resolution recorded the resolve to &quot;continue with ever-growing intensity the age long struggle for the establishment of a new and better social order, in which every citizen will enjoy real political and economic freedom based upon the organisation of the nation&apos;s resources scientifically, industrially and spiritually.&quot;The second largest demonstration was in Glasgow where the number was estimated to be 10,000.   300 organisationswere represented and there were 24 platforms, four of which were Co-operative, one International and one for women only. Practically all the local firebrands spoke, includingCouncillors/
Councillors Kirkwood, Dollan and Locherty, R. Fleck, W. Gallaoher, John Maclean, Sean McLoughlin, James Cox, J. Leokie, J, R. Campbell, A, M. Hannah, E. W. Cant, William Mclaine and Neil  McLean, M.P.The resolution demanded the overthrow of the capitalist system, the establishment of the Co-operative Commonwealth, and the withdrawal of troops from Ireland; greeted the Soviet Republic and protested againsj the arrest and deportation of &quot;subjects&quot; without trial.   My correspondents report that the speeches, which dealt chiefly with Ireland, were, on the whole, mild: the wilder speakers attracted the largest audiences, and the majority of the demonstrators were not particularly enthusiastic.In Lancashire the demonstrations were not as successful as the leaders had anticipated and in some cases, such as Liverpool and Warrington, ?/cre a fiasco.   Not more than 2,000 workers were present at Liverpool; the engineering and ship-building yards were open and the majority of dockers, carters and warehousemen also worked during the morning.   At 4 p.m. some 2,000 Sinn Pciners marched into the Park and infused some life into the proceedings.   At some periods, there were not more than 50 people round each of the four platforms.At Manchester the proceedings were very badly organised and Mr. Clynes was severely heckled by Sinn Feiners; at Leigh there was a procession and meeting of some 300 colliers.   The demonstrations at Rindley and Ashton-in-Makerfield were a complete failure.The Warrington demonstration attracted only about 500people,.while at St. Helens some 3,000 assembled, with theprincipal object of heckling Mr. Sexton, M.P.Owing to the refusal-of the employers to pay wages proportionate BarrowFriday the number of demonstrators/was reduced from about 6,000to/
to 1,000 at midday, when the mon wont to collect their pay.There was no groat onthusiasm in Newcastle, where I:Sa3^^ Day had not previously been celebrated; some 5,000 people took part in the procession.   Mr. John Hill dealt principal^ with the 44 hours-question&quot;and Irish matters were also touch on.At South Shields only about 200 persons, other than the&apos; bands, demonstrated and at Blyth there were only about 60 people and one band.   At Sunderland there was no demonstrate&quot; the real reason being that a first league football match was played in the afternoon.Prom the point of view of numbers the Birmingham proceedings were a failure and at Wolvarhampton the audiences were small.and unenthusiastio.In Coventry most of the men stopped work, in order to haT a holiday, but not to celebrate May Day.   Only about .1,200 people attended the demonstration, although the speakers included Lt. Colonel Mai one, M.P., Arthur MacManus, W. Mellor, Industrie &quot;Editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, and R. C. Wallhead. .   &apos;Prom the Leeds district my correspondent sends tho following figures: of some &apos;50,000   organised Trade Unionists 2,000 attended/the demonstrations and 10,000 a local football match,   At Sheffield.also only a small percentage of the workers tools part in the colob rat ions.In Kent the proceedings wore disappointing for the Labour organisers; only about 100 men marched from Dartford to Dartford Hoath, whoro about 3,000 people, including many women and children, listened to the speeches.In South Wales and Monmouthshire meetings were hold in most districts; the speeches, on the wholo, were moderate: tho numbers of the more Important demonstrations were:-Cardiff/

There is a talk of a special Trade Union Congress for co-ordinating the whole Labour movement in the fight against high prices.WHAT THE WOKE IMG MAN THINKSA correspondent who has conversed with workers selected at random in various London Industries finds that they all have a hearty dislike for the alien and are inclined to resent the dragooning methods of Trade Unions.   A linoleum layer remarked that he hated the Unions - they were the bane of the country.   England used to be a free country but now, thanks to the Unions, the life of his&apos;class was tyranny.   He would like to see powder and shot used freely amongst the Labour leaders and the Jews.A carpenter believed that in the event of trouble, the Government could count on the skilled men who did not want a revolution.   He&apos;thought the revolutionary movement was run by Germans.A locksmith regarded Trade Unions as an inevitable evil and said, &quot;If you belong to a Trade Union things go prettysmoothly.   If not, life is Hell....... I do not want to seerevolution, but if this Government do not bring about a .  revolution with dear boer, dear tobacco, holding up food when there is plenty in the country and filling the country with all the dirty aliens that no other country wants, well then, we never fought the war.&quot;A/
A Welsh caretaker whose father is a railway guard      1remarked: &quot;Give the working man lots of drink and you will never hear a word about revolution except from foreignersand Jews.   That is what every Englishman back from the    i)]VFront thinks too - never knew so many people hate foreigner!A paper hanger complained, &quot;They forced me to join thejtii emUnion but I get back on//this way - I always work late.&quot; He wished all Jews to be given a free passage to Palestine, where he had served.CONSCRIPTION IN RUSSIA .&apos; &quot;Industrial conscription has been the best anti-Bolshevik propaganda that has yet been used.   It has the advantage of coming not from the capitalist but from the Soviet Government itself.   The speakers are being heckled on the subject and their only answer has been the lame rejoinder that the Russian workers themselves approve of the system.   To this a heckler at the Brotherhood Church retorted that Military Conscription had also been placed on the Statute Book by representatives of the workers.CLYDE)A correspondent reports that the industrial, position is improving slowly but steadily and the feeling amongst the me: is better.   The cost of living and the Irish extremists are the two outstanding causes of unrest.The Independent Labour Party has a local membership of about 18,000 and at their meetings condemn all but constitutional action by Unions; they are counteracting the efforts of &quot;the British Socialist Party and Socialist Labour Party, who together have not more than 1,000 members and   Q little money.West of Scotland Soviets are now held together by afew/
few of the faithful only.   They have been deserted by the rank and file almost completely.   Personal Jealousy will prevent them from ever becoming a danger again.Nationalisation, my correspondent reports, &quot;is es dead as a door-nail except among a handful of delegates.&quot;Street corner loafer-orators are continually making extremist speeches, merely as a means of getting a crowd together, then making a collection and in many cases this is then shared out.   My correspondent suggests that if some action was taken against some of them and it was shown that it was an unprofltabls means of making a living it would deter , others as more&apos; than half of the men have no interest in the views they express.OpMMjJK 1ST party on April 24th another Conference was held by the organisations which are trying to form a united communist party, There v/ere present representatives .of. the &quot;Workers Socialist Federation, British Socialist Party, and the1 &quot;unofficial&quot; Socialist Labour Party (Bell, MacManus and W. Paul).   The quarrel still centres round the question of affiliation to the Labour Party, with the additional complication that neither the Socialist Labour Party nor the British Socialist Party desire to bo loft alone to deal with Sylvia Pankhursfs group.   The result of the Conference was entirely negative and it&apos;is not unlikely that the British Socialist Party will eventually transform itself into the Communist Party.   A further meeting will bo held on May 9th.   It is significant that the official Socialist Labour Party was not represented on April 24th.   The Left Wing of the -Independent Labour Party did not reply to the invitation to attend.William Gallacher has come forward with yot another plan for/
for tho formation of a Communist Party.   In brief, ho suggests that a manifesto should be issued inviting all who adhere to the principles of Soviets and of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat to form groups, which would bo geographically divided.   These groups would hold district conferences which would compose agenda and elect delegates for a National Conference.   If this organisation agreed to support Parliamentary action, each member would take an oath refusing to submit to the authority of the Labour Party or the Constitution.In connection with the split in the Socialist Labour Party interest attaches to an article by W. Paul in the May Day issue of &quot;The Worker&quot;.   It will be remembered that, with Bell and Mac&amp;anus, he was chiefly instrumental   in dividing the Socialist Labour Party,   He writes that while the eld &quot;quasi-revolutionary&quot; political parties are &quot;withering away in a weltor of petty feuds&quot; the Communists alone are growing in strength.   Revolutionary action is now the test of principles, theories and organisations. &quot;We are not inactive theorists hiding behind party constitutions which strangle revolutionary energy.   To do is our policy.   To act is our creed.&quot; , v.EX-SERVICE liBINA. 3, Mander, General Secretary, and Alexander Scott are the delegates of the National&apos; Union of 3x-Servioe Men at the International Conference at Geneva.   The expenses of one delegate will be paid by the International Bureau.CoventryTne Building Srado classes held at the Government Instructional factory are much appreciated by ex-Service men.   During their training they receive very generousallowances/
- 9 - &apos;   175allowances.   There are only 120 disabled ex-Service men unemployed.The National Federation of Disabled and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and Comrades of the Great w&quot;ar are increasing their membership and are still unpolitical. GlasgowA demonstration to demand the immediate release of Naval and Military prisoners, organised by the Bridgeton Branch of the International Union of Ex-Service Men, ended in a loss to the Branch of  7 or  8,     The audience never exceeded 100.Baillie Wheatley said, &quot;It is the duty of ex-Service men to force the Government to release these prisoners. They must threaten some drastic action, for that is the only thing this Government understands.   Look at Ireland&quot;, ho said, &quot;one day the Government say they will not release the Irish prisoners but lol next day they change their minds and out come the Irishmen.   Why this strange reverse of action?   Simply because the Irish will brook no nonsense from the Government,   They took action by means of &quot;direct action&quot; and tho Government collapsed. That is what ex-Servioe men must do for their imprisoned comrades.&quot; BirminghamThere is a satisfactory decrease in the number of unemployed ex-soldiers. Dartford. Erith, Crayford.: Woolwich, etc.A correspondent reports that there are very few ex-Regular, Militiamen, Yeomen or Territorials in the National Union of Ex-Service Men in this district.   The recruits are obtained mostly from men enlisted for the duration of the war or conscripts.
It is reported that during the recent International Transport Workers Congress at Christiania the 3ritish       iff delegates refused to promise unconditional support for revolutionary movements.   On the other hand, they are said to have agreed to force nationalisation of the mines and railways, to prevent any action against Soviet Russia or any Central European Power which becomes &quot;Red&quot;, to give mow and financial support to Swedish, Danish and Dutch transport workers who may strike, and to forward propaganda and intelligence as far as lies ii? their power.Too much importance should not be attached to these alleged promises, which are not unlike the boasting utteranoes of Mr. Robert Williams, who is known to have offered his services as messenger to the British Socialist Party during his present visit to Soviet Russia.POST OFFICE workers the Annual Conference of Post Office Workers will be held on May 11th at Morecambe.   The Union is in a weak financial position and this will probably affect its decisioi as to an offensive policy, which is being urged upon it. The Ex-Fawcett Association shows a deficit of  505. 14s. 9jd at the end of last year.   The Ex-Postmen&apos;s Federation had on the same date assets of  3,748. Os. lid, but of thiB amount the sum of   ,801. 14s. 5d was invested in Consols and the sum of  1,050 represents a loan to the &quot;Postmen^ Gazette&quot;. Unless, therefore, great assistance is given from  other Trade Unions, there can scarcely be a national strike. COVENTRY SOCIALIST CLUB 1This Club was entered by burglars last week and  30 was stolen.   Several of the members are suspected.CONVICTION/THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT WORKERS CONGRESS
CONVICTIONOn April 30th Walter Ponder was fined 40s. at Old Street Polioe Court for selling literature in Victoria Park.   Ponder, who is a violent agitator and a member of the East London Workers1 Committee, was convicted for similar offences in July 1919,   (Vide my report No. 11).TBB EXTREMIST PRESSDespite the rising cost of paper there is a remarkable increase in the output of Socialistic literature.   The various journals contain long lists of new pamphlets andi-books and it would seem that the working classes are reading more than heretofore.Three new monthly Labour journals have recently appeared in London; &quot;The Battersea Standard&quot;, &quot;Labour&apos;s Voice&quot; and &quot;The Red Plag&quot;.   The first named is published by the Battersea branch of the Herald League and has an &quot;estimated&quot; circulation of 3,000.   Its objeot is declared to be &quot;the establishment of the Co-operative Commonwealth.&quot;   It is printed on unusually good paper pnd the expenditure is said . to exceed the receipts at present,&quot;labour&apos;s Voioe&quot; is a resuscitation of the &quot;Voice of Labour&quot; which was discontinued in favour of &quot;Freedom&quot; in 1916. It 1b apparently edited by a body of anarchists who style themselves the Liberty Group, formerly the Anarchist Propaganda Group,   The leaders are H, Oakley and L. A, Mo tier, the deaf and dumb editor of &quot;Satire&quot;; the paper is frankly anarchist-communist.   The funds necessary to cover the cost of-publication &quot;have been mostly raised by holding dances during the winter&quot;, but they cover only the first issue and as  20 is needed for the next month a Guarantee fund has been started.&quot;The/
&quot;Tho Rod Flag&quot; oloarly emanates from Miss Sylvia PankhursVs federation; it is the organ of. tho Young Socialist League, 152, Fleet Street, (the address of the People&apos;s Russian Information Bureau) and is published by the Agenda Press, as is the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;.   The Young Socialist League is an offshoot of the Young Communist International which claims to have 38 periodicals and nearly 250,000 members in various countries.   Contributors to the first issue include A, Fineberg, L. A. Motler and, James Stewart, formerly the editor of the &quot;Young Rebel&quot;.   The editor is Nathan B. Whycer, who is probably identical with a Russian Jew who was at one time a member of the &quot;Young-Jewish national League&quot; and the &quot;Zionist Association.&quot;     .......   &apos;&quot;The Vanguard&quot;, a former organ of the British Socialist Party, which was suppressed on account of seditious articles in 1916, has been revived by John Maclean.   Be writes in&apos;an editorial preamble;   &quot;Dissatisfaction with the plight of the British Socialist Party maimed by this year&apos;s onslaught of capitalism has compelled us to resurrect 4The Vanguard? in the hope that we may concentrate the minds of the.workers on the revolution to be gone through in this country as well as on the one gone through -already in Russia.   The main use of the Russian Workers&apos; success is the inspiration we ought to derive from it for the accomplishment of a similar feat within the bounds of Britain.&quot; t&quot;The Call&quot;, of which 6,000 extra copies were ordered for May Day, will in, future consist of twelve instead of eight : pages; this will entail an additional loss of, 25 per week. As the loss, on the paper in 1919 was  620. 8s.. ^d the &apos; existence of a subsidy from some outside source is obvious.The circulation of &quot;Solidarity&quot; is reported to have-increased from 9,000 in January to 10,000 in April,   1,000 oopies were sold in Shepherd&apos;s Bush last month.SOT/
SINK FEIN IN M britain on the whole, the events of the last two weeks have strengthened rather than diminished the bitter feeling between the British and Irish workers.The number of Irishmen in the West of Scotland at present is not more than 200,000; of these 40,000 are Ulstermen or anti-Sinn Feiners and 16,000 are in out-lying districts where they are not likely to affeot the industrial position.   The total number of Irish extremists who might create industrial disturbances in Glasgow is 90,000.   The membership of the &quot;Volunteer Army&quot; on March 31et, 1920, was 10,341, but only about 2,000 are reliable, the remainder being youths who have joined the movement for the social side.   On April 20th, 1920, 1,233 were armed.   The &quot;Army&quot; is practically undisciplined and the rush of recruits which would follow a crisis would reduce it to a mob.The point which gives rise to anxiety in connection with the Sinn Feiners of Glasgow is not their military organisation, but their hold upon the local Trade Unions, especially in the unskilled trades.   Havingfeiled them-selves to obtain official positions, they have worked to gain the support and sympathy of non-Irish leaders, with so much success that it is difficult exactly to estimate their power.   This alteration of method has given a misleading appearance of quietude to their activities,At present the Sinn Feiners are working to induce the Trade Unions to refuse to handle arms, ammunition or troops for Ireland.   They are making considerable headway and it has been suggested that it would be worth while to effect the shipments, from small ports by means of the Royal Navy.Apart/
Apart from the rougher element there are signs that the better class workers are growing weary of the incessant Sinn Fein agitation.   The   Clyde Workers1 Defence Committee, which is more or less an Irish body, is losing influence.On May 2nd a demonstration of some 9,000 people, -chiefly Irish, was held at Glasgow to demand the rolease of the Wormwood Scrubs prisoners.   About 2,500 members of the &quot;Volunteer Army&quot; performed military evolutions and two companies  &quot;of women, probably members of the Cumaan-na-mBan, equipped as nursing staff, were present.   Violont denunciation-tions of the English and the English Government were made, inter alios, by Nolan Walsh, Thomas Macdonall, John Ferguson, Patrick Quinlan and a boy of 16 named Grattan,On Hay 1st Sean licGraith called off further demonstrations at Wormwood Scrubs.   It is not unlikely, however, that impromptu demonstrations will be siimmonad secretly, in order to thwart organised opposition.   Stormy scenes occurred outside the piason during the week and it is stated that in all 150 persons have beon hurt.   The opposition is much discussed end resented in   Sinn Fein circles.   The experiences of the last week seem lively to make hunger striking in this country unpopular.Although the Workers Socialist Federation and the Herald League are devoting themselves to Sinn Fein propaganda, they are meeting with success only amongst the converted. An Irish meeting held in Hyde Park met with considerable opposition on May 1st.\ On May 2nd a demonstration of railwayman at Wormwood Scrubs was a fiasco as although thero were thousands of spectators the actual demonstrators numbered only about 300, including 20 ox-florvico men.During the week there have been meetings in Woolwich and Willesdon, which were fairly well attended.   The usualspeeches/
1   178speeches were made.E. J, Connolly and 2, Mo Alpine are endeavouring, through the Parsee Saklatvala, to leave the country without passports, probably as seamen, in order to get to Russia with messages from the Sinn Foiners to the Soviets.In London Sinn Fein circles the visit to Dublin of Dr. MacCartan, the Irish Republican &quot;Ambassador&quot; in America, is looked upon as a sign of the recognition of the Republic by the American Government.   It is stated that the Russian Soviet Government has recognised the Irish Republic and that cordial greetings have been exchanged.As anticipated in my last report the strike of the Irish dockers at Liverpool has not been a success and Sinn Feiners in London are very&quot;disappointed with the result.   My correspon-dent reports that although the leaders still claim that the strike is a &quot;huge success&quot; large numbers of strikers returned to work on Monday.Mr. James Sexton had a hostile reception at St. Helens on May Day and has been roundly abused by Councillor Kelly for refusing to make the strike official.   Sinn Fein is reported to be increasing steadily in this town where numbers of young men constantly arrive from Ireland.IRELAND \The number of outrages of all kinds reported during the week shows that conditions are still bad.   The state of terror caused by the action of the Irish Republican Army is helping the ordinary criminal to commit crimes unmolested,   There appears to be an increase in the number of illegal drillings and practice mobilisations, and the morale of the Irish Republican Army has improved; the leaders appear to find no difficulty in getting men to attend.   Threatening letters are on the increase.The/
*The general situation in Dublin remains unchanged.   Sinn Fein Scouts have been active and rumours from different sources point to some important events occurring in the near future. The shooting of Military officers and damage to Government      fi property have been mentioneduThe only hostile act during the week was the throwing of a orudely constructed bomb into the yard adjoining Kevin Street Police Barracks about 10 p.m. on the 2nd May.   It was contained in a small tin canister and did not explode.   The motive is believed to be the intimidation of some recruits who had recently joined Kevin Street Police Depot, and probably oause some injury.A fresh effort is being made to collect funds for the Dail Bireann Loan by issue of circulars and jotices.Alderman Thomas Kelly, M.P., Lord Mayor elect, recently released from Wormwood Scrubs through ill-health, has returned to Dublin.   His arrival caused no display; the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution of welcome.May Day was not recognised aB a Labour holiday in Dublin. On May 2nd-the Dublin Trades Council marched to Glasnevin Cemeovy to place wreaths on the graves of labour leaders killed during the 1916 Rebellion.A new group has-been formed in Dublin with the object, of obtaining amendments to the Home Rule Bill in order to make it imore acceptable.   This group appears to be increasing in numbers and to include men of importance who have held different political views hitherto.
