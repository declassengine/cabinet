,/ i        /I/This Document is the Property o*Ho Li.Lil.ii./ soumise - -............. -*        jCABINET. OLuIIL ! iPRICE OF SUGAR, THE WHEAT POSITION, AND THE BREAD SUBSIDY.Memorandum- by the Food Controller.1.     I am informed that the Cabinet committee on the price of Sugar has decided that the retail price of sugar should be fixed at 1/2 per lb as from May 17th until further notice,2.     I assume that the Cabinet have considered the effect of this prospective advance on the food index number.    The contemplated increase of 4d. in the price of sugar will send up the food index number by no less than lol points, bringing that figure to 150.2. on 1st June.    This is after taking into account seasonal reductions in such foodstuffs as Milk, Eggs, and Fish.   If the chancellors suggestion in C.P*1243, that the price of the loaf should be inoreased by Jd., is also sanctioned by the Cabinet, this, with the correspond-ing increase in the price of flour^ will send the figure to 152.   That is to say, an increase of 17 points will take place as between 1st April and the 1st June.3.    The effect of this increase in food prices on the generaloost of living index number, Is some 10 points *   I estimate the addition to the Wages Bill, which this increase in the cost ofliving will necessitate under the existing agreements, at approximate-ly  ,5,000,000 a year for the small proportion  of workers covered by tne agreements.To this must he added a corresponding increase which will no doubt be claimed by other workers.4.    As regards any increase in the price of the loaf at the present time, I share the views expressed by Lord Crawford.CHARLES A. McCURDY,Ministry of Food. 13th May, 1920.
