From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,4th May 1920.&quot;G ---^j^&amp;ar the lino.^^\.o\xv telegram No. 522 S., dated 30th April. Afghanistan. 1 have carefully considered whole question, but regret that I cannot accept your view. T do not think we should allow Afghan statement of demands to force our hands in direction of premature offer of concessions. Object of Mussoorie conversations was to clear away misunderstandings. We have now cleared away misunderstanding, at least as regards Afghan desiderata, which we find to be wholly inadmissible in. themselves apart from minatory terras in which they are propounded. Meanwhile, Afghans have invaded our territory and Amir treats our protests with frivolous disregard, telling us to make concessions instead of complaints. Situation gives no sign of what we have always held to be essential, preliminary to negotiations for treaty of friendship, viz., display of friendly intentions by Afghans. In these circumstances I regret that I cannot give you the contingent authority ,for which you ask either in regard to title His Majesty or to subsidy to be granted when negotiations for treaty of friendship take place. As regards title, after Amir&apos;s conduct of last year I could not lay proposition before His Majesty the King until Amir has given some real proof of changed disposition. I do not underrate possible consequences of sending back Afghan delegates in unfriendly frame of mind ; but such consequences would not necessarily be averted by offer of concessions which Afghans would probably consider inadequate, nor can I believe that offer of any fresh concessions, so long as Afghans maintain present truculent and&apos; unreasonable attitude, would effectually pave way to satisfactory settlement. The most that I would be prepared to authorise is hint to Afghans that the grant of a subsidy would only be the result of the. establishment of real friendship and good behaviour on Amir&apos;s part and that title of His Majesty might follow.
