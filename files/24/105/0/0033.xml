fj     SECRET.     For the information of Members of the Board.      i      1 A i\&apos; This Dooumo&quot;h J!;::o Property of weekly APPRECIATION OF MATTERS DP EAVAL^itNTEREST . No. 72.&apos;      ^&quot;^^^V For the week ended 1st hay, 1920,?^P. 11233   jfjInformation has been received from Esthonian Government that all buoys on route Libau - Reval have been replaced.S .S . &quot;Dongola&quot;   was due to sail from Southampton on 1st May with Lithuanian women and children.   500 Russians to be embarked at Rotterdam and conveyed to Libau*   &quot;Dongola&quot; then to proceed to Hango to embark the remaining British subjects for repatriation.War Office has declined to provide an armed guard or police for this ship.Rear-Admiral Sir Walter Cowan, K.C.B., arrived at Copenhagen in E M *S * &quot;DELHI&quot; on 28th April and took over the duties of Senior Naval Officer, Baltic.H .k .S. &quot;SESAME&quot;, of Flensborg Force, has been detailed to convey members of the Aeronautical Commission of Control to German Seaplane stations in the Baltic *     H.k.&amp;. &quot;SESAME&quot; will arrive at V/arnemunde for this purpose on 3rd Bay.Movement of Lettish Troops.a request was received on behalf of the Lettish. Army authorities for the use of a destroyer to convey certain Lettish military ranks between Libau and windau.     S *&apos;M .0. Baltic was instructed by telegram that the use of R.K- Ships for this purpose was not approved *Rumoured Bolshevik Naval Activity.A report was received from Helsingfors to the effect that the Bolsheviks were preparing their fleet and that they would have at their disposal one squadron mounting 45 12&quot; guns *   Their Intention was stated to be to threaten, Finnish and Latvian coasts so as to force peace terms favourable to the Soviet.   The Bolsheviks had declared their assurance that the British Squadron in the Baltic would EEEiaiHXxiLE maintain strict neutrality.It is also reported that ice is being cut and mines laid in the Kaporski Gulf.Trade.Further reports have been received as to the impractical)-ility of giving effect to any trade arrangements made with the Soviets owing to (l) Inadequacy of mechanical transport which cannot be remedied owing to transport required for military purposes, due to new Polish-Ukrainian offensive 3 (2) Scarcity of food.   Apparently &quot;the only produce available for export is a small quantity of timber and flax.No decision as to the disposal of munitions on board OLGA, under detention at Rosyth, has yet been arrived at.   The French Government have stated that they are interested in the disposal, 50% of the cargo having been destined by the French for Finland to replace munitions lent by the Finns to the late North West Army at the request of the French Government, the remaining
.*   2   m14150$ being originally destined for the sair:.e purpose direct from the French Government *   Meanwhile C-in-C, Rosyth reports that 50$ of the ammunition should be dumped.   All action, is, however, suspended pending Foreign Office decision.Finland.Peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks have been interrupted W through the abrupt departure of the Soviet delegates on 24th April. The delegates stated that negotiations had to be broken off owing to the necessity of consulting their Government at Moscow on the Karelian end Petchenga controversy.     They stated, however, that the interruption was temporary, although they were unable to give a date for the resumption of negotiations.   The Finnish Prime ikinister does not fear a military invasion cf Finland in consequence of the rupture, but is apprehensive of a Soviet attack on Repola and Porajarvi. He is,&apos; however, greatly concerned as to a   possible Russian Naval attack on Finnish littoral in the Gulf of Finland, and urges the despatch of a British Naval Force to Bjorko to deal with remaining Russian Units. He also requests H .1- . Government to bring pressure on Soviet Govern-ment through Eras sin and Litvinov to induce the Soviets to abstain from an attack on Finland.     It is reported that the Bolsheviks have a number of British tanks on the Finnish frontieroThe German ship BURGERUEISTER ESCHENBURGH, from lubeok, is reported to have discharged munitions of war at Helsingfors, destined for the use of the Protective Corps, a portion only being earmarked &apos; for the kinistry of l/ar*   This action, with regard to the stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles, is under consideration.    It is reported that this action indicates a monarchist movement in July and Is of German origin-.     Admiralty has informed S.N.O. Baltic that the only 0.1.6*s available for purchase by Finland are the two at Copenhagen, but that a few C *h.5. Engines are available for immediate disposal, details of which will bo given ia required by the Finnish Government.Latvia *Peace negotiations with the Soviet Government continue at Moscow *   Lettish Social Democrats have refused to take part in the negotiations.   Recent elections show that over 50/3 of soldiers voted for this party, and the political situation is therefore considered uncertain.   A request by the Latvian Government for the use of H.M. Ships to transport the garrison from Windau has not been granted, and S.N.O.   Baltic has been informed that similar requests must not be entertained in the future.Repatriation of British Nationals *Negotiations continue for the release of British subjects undergoing inprisonment for criminal offences in Russia.   The Rev. North, C.B.E., has at last crossed the Finnish frontier and is on his way home.     This chaplain ismsMmL rendered most auspicious services in Moscow in work connected with British prisoners of war.Denmark *Naval Attache reports that the Danish Government requires 1000 tons of coal at Iceland for use during the visit of H.M. King of Denmark to this place.   The request is under consideration by the Foreign Office.^ North Russia. f--The relief expedition in H .lvi. Icebreaker &quot;SVIAT0G0R&quot;, lent to Norwegian Government for the relief of the Russian Icebreaker S0L0VEI BCJDIMIROVITCH, ice-bound in the Kara Sea, is fitting out at Tromso with all despatch.     British Collier S.S. UHLENH0RST, with 4;.000 tons of coal, is now due at Tromso.BLACK SEA/
&quot;3- 142EM OK SEA AND DANUBE.General Keyes reports that new life has been inspired into the white Army by General Wrangel.   Provided no serious offensive is started by the Reds before 10th Lay and Allied support is continued, General Grange1 considers he will be able to consolidate his defences.   The question of the Allies supplying food as being concomitant with, their policy of assisting the White Forces until armistice negotiations commence, has been raised by Admiralty and is under consideration&apos;..   C-in-C, mediterranean summarises possible Naval sir port on the Crimean front as(a) Naval patrols on North Crimean front only so far as it denies the use of the coast to the Red Army and limits their advance to the central region where White Forces can be in greater numbers to resist.(b) fcioral effect of Naval support is inestimable.(c) Offensives by seaplanes are practicable.(d) Invasion via Kertch Straits can be rendered impractl-cable by ships&apos; gun-fire, bombing of gun-positions and presence of patrol craft.On the 25th April it was decided ^S^^^^^^^mm^s^t SMil^ that the C-in-C, Mediterranean should give such assistance as possible to protect the Crimea from invasion..   No men should be landed.   Operations should continue until Soviet commences to negotiate with Grange 1.kovements of Commander-in-Chief *C-in-C, Mediterranean left Constantinople for Malta in &quot;Ajax&quot; on 27th April; he will. return to Constantinople about 9th May after transferring his flag to &quot;Iron Duke&quot;.   During his absence the -Vice-Admiral Commanding, 1st Battle Squadron will be in charge of operations on the Turkish Coast, and the bear-Admiral, 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of Russian Operations in the zone from Constanza to Batcum.The 1st Battle Squadron will remain in Turkish waters until the presentation of the Allied Peace Terms to Turkey.Odessa and Bolshevik Advance.Reported rising:&apos; against the Red Army continue to be received.   C-in-C, Mediterranean reports that Odessa is defended by six 6-inch guns, 3 howitzers and 6 field guns.   The town is occupied by the 14th Soviet Army.   The Morale of the Red troops is low and many desertions are taking place.   The peasants have risen in many places and cut the railway lines.     The Bolsheviks are growing daily more unpopular through lack of food and work.   Petlura andCalilday Armoi&apos;s Brigand bands are growing In strength and becoming a serious threat to the Bolsheviks.Sochi.Commanding Officer, K.), .S. &quot;CARADOC&quot;, reports the situation Is critical.   Reds have captured the River Sakhe position and White Cossacks are retiring in the direction of Georgia under Bolshevik pressure.     An International Hospital has been formed at Sochi.-&apos;,&apos;Georgia.The situation is most critical * The Government continue to state that their sympathies are pro-Ally and anti-Bolshevik,but the/
-4- &apos;   143but the retreat of the Don and Kuban Cossacks under Bolshevik pressure, coupled with the Azerbaijan revolution in favour of Bolshe-vism, makes the probability of Georgia turning Bolshevik a very possible event.   The further supply of Allied munitions to Georgia Is deprecated by G.O.C., Constantinople.Meanwhile the situation at Bstoum is grave, and C-in-C Mediterranean has been authorised by ILL;. Government tc evacuate the British garrison if necessary.Caucasus *The C-in-C, mediterranean reports that the present diplomatic methods no longer count in Transcaucasia *   Bolsheviks are concentra-ting at Vladikavkaz, Grosni and Balm.   He considers th.at without military assistance these states will &quot;suffer eclipse&quot;.   The coast road in the neighbourhood of Gagri can be made impassable by H Shi!-s and seaplanes, backed by the moderate Georgian force now in position.The support afforded by the Navy, if, as General Ivilne advises, a small area enclosing the Town of Batoum only should be held, would be confined solely to the flank resting on the sea .Tchicherin has been informed that the movement of Bolshevik forces along the coast to attack Batoum is an act of war which H Forces will continue to resist.Caspian.It is reported that Azerbaijan has bought a quantity of artillery and munitions from General Dratsenka, at Baku, for the defence of that port.   /-Iso tbwt the Bolshevik garrison at Krasnovodsk has been reduced, troops being sent to Charjai. There are twelve Bolshevik ships at Petrovsk.A list of ships of the Volunteer Fleet, Interned at Enzelihas been received^- It comprises 12 ships including 5 seaplane andC.t;.B. Carriers and 2 transports.   There ere also 2 barges with Russian5&quot; guns which it is proposed to utilise as floating batteries for defence purposes.G.E.Q. Mesopotamia considers that the Russian internees should be moved from Enzeli as they have already started to turn Bolshevik.Azerbaijan.A revolution tool: place during the week and the town of Baku was occupied by the Bolsheviks after a short bombardment from the sea.     Baku, with its oil supplies, is now available as a base for the Bolshevik Caspian Fleet.GgNgRAL SITUATION IN SOUTH RUSSIA.The following is an analysis of appreciation of the general situation in South Russia. It is of particular Naval interest, as it foreshadows the necessity of keeping strong Naval Forces in the Black Sea for some time to come.South Russia.     Briefly summarised the situation in the different tbes^a-G of operations is as follows:-Poland.   Marshal Pilsudski&apos;s offensive against the Bolsheviks, which has been in preparation for some time, has been launched and is progressing successfully.The objective has been Kiev, capital of the most flourish-ling Russian Sate, and therefore, for internal and commercial reasons,the best/
the best strategic line.   Pllsudski, who is stated to be a man or exceptionally high mental calibre, is reported to have said that this offensive is the preliminary of the peace negotiations between Poland and the Soviet Government with a view to enforceing their demands.   The military alliance with the Ukraine definitely states that Polish troops will withdraw within their frontiers as soon as the Ukraine Government is stabilised.   Any inflated ideas of the Polish Republic should be susceptible to Allied pressure.   The Allies have already clearly stated that Poland must decide for herself whether she makes peace with the Bolsheviks or not, but with an inforence that she should do so.Ukraine.   During the last three years, owing to the pre-occupation of the Red Army in other directions, this rich agri-cultursl State has been practically left alone, except for a small area in and around the Odessa Province *   The agrarian interests have predominated, the outcome being that a number of tiny Republicanism-lics have grown up inside the state, each determined to hold its produce, but bound together in the common cause of hatred to any invader and dislike of their own town communities.   The latter have developed into marauds or forays by the agricultural ciis-stricts into the Ukraine towns.   Hetman Petlura formed, a capable band of brigands who, taking advantage of tho state of affairs, has indiscriminately harried all and sundry - Red and white Forces around him, and his band is growing the nucleus of the Ukriine Government, with whom Poland has entered into a military alliance.   The Provinces in and around Odessa are throwing in their lot with this party, and anti-Bolshevik risings are reported by C-in-C,&apos; Mediterranean.Crimea.     Gene.. a1 \-range 1 is holding the Crimea with every prospect of success, supported by H.M. Ships until such time as the Soviet Government commence armistice negotiations with him.The question of the Allies supplying food and coal is under consideration. Don and Kuban Cossacks are retiring under Bolshevik pressure to Georgia.     The latter&apos;s attitude under the Bolshevik menace is hostile to this refugee army, and it is probable that they will have to be evacuated to the Crimea, the only rallying point of the Volunteer Army.     The Russian opportunist and neurotic temperament, so prone to orgasms, may well cause a change of attitude in General   rangei in view of the recrudescent offensive of the anti-Bolshevik Forces in the Odessa district, Poland end the Ukraine.   This possible change must be taken note of before any commitments of supplying food and coal are decided upon.Red army.   The Soviet Government, under the fanatic leader-ship of Trotsky, has built up a very powerful army, disciplined and with high morale.   The latter is due to the gradual growth of the Nationalist sentiment, fostered by skilful propaganda, directed against so-called &apos;foreign intervention&apos;. Its successes have, however, exhausted it, and now it sees the greater part of its country clear of foreign forces, the reaction asserts it-self and the army desires peace.   The Soviet blunder of forming Labour Armies, which was nothing less than a form of serfdom, recognised too late by Lenin, has mB.de the masses, in which is incorporated the Army, heartily sick of the present Government, and they demand a moderate -&quot;policy which must make peace with all its enemies at once, so as to use the summer economically to re-habilitate the country before the next winter.   The most capable Navy and Army Officers belong to the old regime, and oro-w -joined the Army through, force of circumstances. Their instincts are hostile to the Communist ideals, and. they welcome this antipathy to the existing Government.&apos;   The astute Lenin realises the situation better than Trotsky, and will not be caught if he can help it. He therefore is all for peace and silencesthe/
- 6145the fanatical units of the Government with eloquent word-pictures of   the penetration, by peaceful propaganda., of Foreign States *The recent capitulation of Azerbaijan Republic, which gives the valuable base of Baku to the Caspian Fleet, and opens up the oil districts of Grozni and Baku, must be admitted to be a. powerful example &quot;In favour of his argument -The Bolshevik tendencies of hsthonia since their peace is another example *2onelusionsTh.e conelusiens arrived at, vIewing the general sItu&quot;at*&apos;ion)&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;are(1) Soviets \bill make peace with-Finland and Latvia, Poland and Ukraine as soon as possible, with the *arriere penseev of dealing with the latter   States in a few years hence for readjustment of any unfavourable peace terms,(2) They will make peace with Lithuania in their own good time, as there is no Lithuanian front:   They may use her as a a pawn when ne xtiating with Poland owing to Lithuania&apos;s hostile attitude to the latter.(3) General .&apos; range 1 to be dealt with last of all. They know that the Crlmen is not self-supporting with its redundant population, and that skilful propaganda amongst the Allies .111 inflame public opinion against indefinite support cf his forces with food, fuel and Kaval&apos; assistance.   General Wrangel will have to make terms, the best he can hope for being a general amnesty for his forces and repatriation^CHINA,Siberia oC-in-C, China, in a comprehensive summary (dated Larch 1920)  of the situation based on very lucid reports from Rear-Admiral in H .1.: .S * &quot;CAIRO&quot; at Vladivostock, considers that the Nationalist feeling in Siberia is growing and Red and white are combining in hatred of foreign Intervention, particularly against the Japanese a   He considers the prospects of the future as very vague, and foreshadows the possible course of events as : -(l) Evacuation of Csech and Ailogene troops and refugessa (2) Evacuation of Japanese troops.(.3) The so-called Zemstvo Government of Vladivostock openly assumed as Bolshevik-(4) Nationalisation of everything, foil owed by. the murder or execution of former forces of the Kolchak GovernmentoThe Military Situation.(a) Vladivostock and the East Chinese Railway (along which the evacuation of the Czechs., etc a,, is taking place) are garrisoned by Japanese, whose pickets are everywhere and who behavemuch as if the town already belonged to them.   They probably have about 35,000 troops.   General 01, the Military Commander, is supposed to be against their attempting to remain   here, but General Yunguchi (his Chief of Staff) is a strong       militarist and fire-eater - besides being a most amusing and interesting man t to meet*   The town is further policed by an international police force drawn from /the Allied troops and commanded by Colonel Johns on?   The American Military Mission are rapidly withdrawing and expect to have all left by the 1st April,   They have not beenwise/
v/ise in their methods of treating the Russians, and were the objects of all newspaper attacks not so very long ago, but their position has been usurped by the Japanese, who are furiously hated by allo(b) The position up the lino is very complicated, but, broadly, the tide of Bolshevism is sweeping up close after tho roar-guard of tho retreating Czechs as they slowly make their way to the East *     They have about 50$000 on or close to the rail in the neighbourhood of Irkutsk, the last echelon being probably 50 miles V/est of that town..     They are a fine body of men, and all praise is due to them for their efforts during the last three , years . but they are not leaving the country empty-handed and are noi not in any way inclined to take a back seat..   Whether the steamers in which they are being..repatriated will carry all their loot remains to be seen, but the rate of progression Eastward is seriously hampered&apos;by the quantities of so-called stores they find it necessary to bring with them&apos;   The Czechs are expected here at the rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a month, up to the number of 52,0009 but with tho advent of Spring there is hope that the capacity of the railway between Vladivostock and Irkutsk will improve .Lixdd up with them are 2,000 Letts, 3,000 Poles, 4,000 Serbs, and 2;g00 Roumanians, who thankfully grasp the few crumbs of traffic that the Czechs allow theme   Friction Is possibly growing, and recently about 2,000 Poles are believed to have given      the unequal contest and surrendered, to the Bolsheviks:(c) In supreme command of this motley crew is the French General Janin, who probably has to ask whether any order willbe obeyed before he rives it, and. whose authority is only recognised when convenient.   He is likely to have a bad time before him when he returns to France owing to his recent delivery of Kolchak to tho Soviet at Irkutsk which, however expedient it may have been, still requires a good deal of explanation.    It is understood that he is now under orders to return to France. The small remnant of Kolchak1s gold, which was under Hapanese and Czech guard at the Station at So Irkutsk, has vanished, and so far its whereabouts is not known.(cl) Somewhere in the middle of all this turmoil are the remains of the Siberian Army, who have marched from Omsk all the way to Irkutsk - a marvellous feat of endurance with a winter temperature of 50   below freezing points   They are variouslyi        -i n * ti A    1 r\ r\ r\      . w* f\ r\        fTVi % t-i -\ it- . -and&quot;oney art; nunv  ouiiimuxiucu vy  v ujlz/ouiiu v a&amp;y o     lucir cvrrx vw.x auVladivostock is within the bounds of possibility, but very unlike-ly*   If they arrive, the face of affairs here will undergo a complete though temporary change, as they are the only really thorough anti-Bolshevik Party in the country*   They are said to have .a working agreement with the Czech troops and are marching/parallel to the line alongside them. They will probably all be dispersed by the Soviet troops and eventually make their escape into Mongolia, which should provide a field for their undoubted talents as brigands.   The remainder of K01chak&apos;s Army under Semenov and. Kalmikov are in the neighbourhood, of Chita, and one can only trust that they will not meet the fate which they deserve.RepatriationoThere are about 60,000 Czechs and Aiiogene troops due for repatriation by British and American steamers, and in addition there is a certain number of civilian and military prisoners of war of which the number and whereabouts are unl-rpwn. The French Commission, who are in general charge of the repatriation, expect to get the last of the C -echs away by the beginning of August ,1920The/
The Japanese incident at Hailar, on the Chinese Eastern Railway, where&quot;a conflict with Czechs and Soviet details took place,, has increased the complexity of the general situation. In the meantime Japanese troops continue to occupy Vladivostock.Danube *The temporary Inter Allied Danube Commission has recently carried out a cruise of inspection to the various Danube ports.Admiral Troubridge reports that he has every hope that Czechoslovakia will soon be taking a very active- part in Danube river navigation, and that Austria will soon institute a regular steamship service between Vienna arm&apos; Rumania./On the upper Danube Bavaria is very active and anxious to get to business with the lower Danubian States *   This section Is very well regulated,In Jugo-Slavia navigation is progressing though the opportunities are not made the most of end there is much mal-administration as well as a disinclination to trade with neighbours *1&apos;he visit t).o Rumania had a good effect. This country has hitherto been one of the greatest stumbling blocks to the resump-tion of normal conditions but should soon be bearing its share in restoring free navigation, though in Rumania there is always a gulf between promise and performance, and the bad rela-tions which exist between her and her neighbours, without excep-tion, exercise a bad effect on commerce.As a general result of the cruise Admiral Troubridge hopes misgivings have been dispelled and that the Governments concerned now realise   that the labours of the Commission are solely for the benefit of the Riverftln States.Though the position in South East and Central Europe cannot be described as satisfactory, either politically or commercially, yet there is constant progress and the work now being done will in the future benefit British trade and commerce.*he differences between the Danubian States are not so great as might be imagined and are due to a false appreciation of the actions and sentiments of each other. Ti-eir enmities are fostered by the foolish actions of subordinate officials. Responsible statesmen are eager to establish good relations *TURKEYoLord Curzon has now informed Admiral de Robeck that the Peace Treaty provider: for the appointment of a commission of the three Great Powers to draft within six months of the coming into force of the Treaty, a scheme of local autonomy for the pre-dominantly Kurdish Areas with the right of appeal within one year of the same date to the League of Nations for complete independence.Anti-Nationalist Movement tThe Assistant British High Commissioner, Constantinople, 23rd April reported as follows :-&quot;According to the latest information Anzavur has retired to Guenen followed by considerable Nationalist forces, and is awaiting the arrival of munitions etc. which must now he sent to Kara Bigha&quot;&quot;I submit that the Nationalist threat to the Dardanelles which this retirement entails must not be overlookedc&quot;&quot;The Grand Vizier stated on April 21st. that anzavur&apos;s force was unbroken, and does not appear to despair of the success of the policy of combating the Nationalists by means of a countermove/
The agreement arrived at on the subject of the restitu-tion of 150,000 tons of ex-German shipping, now under French management, is commented upon with appreciation by tho Press. This shipping will remain in French hands end will be paid for out of the sum clue from Germany to France for reparation] that in to say, the French owners will pay      French Government for the ships, and the amount will be credited to&quot;&apos;Germany and debited to France&apos;s reparation account.PALESTINE.The mandate for Palestine is to be British, and is purely political.MISCELLANEOUS/!,move in8the areas where moral suasion will &quot;be availablec&quot;It is too soon to say whether Anzavur^s move is broken past repair, or what success, if any, mor -1 suasion will have in Anatolia.&quot;The following are however clear(1) &quot;Anzavur has suffered defeat in a serious conflict with the Nationalists, and cannot therefore be relied on as a counterpoise to their efforts even if he recovers himself at all.(2) &quot;Other movements on the same lines as Anzavur&apos;s are too inchoate to be counted on for purposes of effective resistance to the Nationalists in the near future.(3) &quot;The announcement of drastic peace terms must ,inevitably detract still more from the effectiveness of the anti-Nationalists, many of them will be thrown into sympathy, if not active co-operation, with the Nationalists.&quot;The Allies therefore must rely on their own resources to enforce a drastic peace, and it is desirable from a political, as distinct from a military point of view, that the Western Powers should be prepared to undertake the task with their own forces.    The use of the Greek army for enforcement of the peace terms in Thrace and Anatolia will involve grave danger of general massacres of the civil population, Christians and Loslems alike, and the devastation of the country side.&quot;PGace Delegation-.On 28th April the assistant British High Commissioner, Constantinople reported that the Turkish Peace Delegation were to leave for Paris by special train on 1st may, arriving about fivo days later *GERMANY.The Supreme Council decided on 26th April that all surplus (naval) war material which canes under Article 192 of the Peace Treaty, except equipment for light cruisers and destroyers going to Prance and Italy, is to be destroyed in Germany..   The ^arisings&quot; from this material are to be turned over to the Reparation Gommiission with a view to their disposing of them and crediting Germany with the expense she has incurred in carrying out the destruction thereof *   Equipment for the vescels allotted to Prance and Italy under the Protocol are to be stored pending instructions as to their disposal by the Conference of ambassadors .AUSTRIA.The Austrian Treaty Is likely to be officially ratified by Great Britain during the next few days.FRANCE.
