We do feel, on the other hand, that there are many matters of Imperial oonaequenoe such as position with regard to League of Nations, the situation in Russia and the Near East, question of the renewal in 1921 of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, in addition to matters of inter^Imperial concern which make it very desirable that the Prime minister a of the Empire should meet again in the course of the present year.    In fact this would only be in accordance with the conclusions arrived at in 1917 as to the desirability of the Imperial Conference and Cabinet meeting annually.Such a meeting will also be desirable from the point of view of the subsequent Constitutional Conference both for a preliminary discussion of the subjects to be raised and to settle the actual composition of theConstitutional
Constitutional Conference, for instance whether Conference, like other Conferences, should he purely governmental or should include representatives of other parties and in fact he conference of small parliamentary delegations.Further, a short time ago when raising the question of a meeting of the Imperial,Conference in tto coining autumn, the Canadian Government suggested that it might he convenient to hold it at Ottawa.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Governor General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received Colonial Office 4.47 p.m. 31st March 1920)

VERY SECRET. With reference to your ? telegram of the 27th of March following from my Prime Minister for Mr. Lloyd George. Message begins. With reference to your message conveyed to me by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have no objection to the next Imperial Cabinet or Conference being held at Ottawa. An a matter of fact, if the Conference is to be held this year, Ottawa would, for several reasons, suit New Zealand even better than London but I am very doubtful whether I should be able to get away. At the present time there is very serious unrest in New Zealand and I think it would be unwise for me to go outside of the Dominion for even three or four months if the position does not improve before September or October. Moreover it is almost certain that the New Zealand Parliament will be in session from June to November. I am of opinion that the proposed Conference should be postponed until the following year if possible. I realise the importance of the other questions and without having enough inside information to be able express a definite opinion I consider that the Anglo-Japanese treaty should be renewed. The question of the League of Nations rents almost entirely with the United States and I am not inclined to recade from the position which was taken by us at the Peace Conference. New Zealand and Australia are


are concerned vitally in the defence of the Pacific and on this matter some definite understanding should he arrived at,    The question of inter-Imperial shipping and other matters are also waiting to he dealt with.    Message ends*
Paraphrase telegram from the Governor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received, Colonial Office, 2.45 p.m. 3rd April, 1920.)April     Secret.Following in answer to your telegram of March 27th from the Prime Minister begins:   Contents of your telegram have been noted.   I wish to make following observations with regard to questions at the end.   I do not see what purpose would be served by holding the annual meeting of the Prime Ministers away from London.   The meeting is informal and confidential and does not mark any special occasion, Questions of the Imperial Policy to be discussed would require reference to foreign and other Ministers.   This might be difficult at Ottawa.   It would be different with constitutional conference.  This will be great public land-oark in history of the Empire and might well be held next year in premier Dominion.   It should be remembered also that the Dominions leave much business to transact in London end the meeting ef the Prime Ministers in London affords a much more suitable opportunity for such bisiness than a ic&amp;meeting at Ottawa would.  I hope that the end of September or October would be suitable for me to come to London though I prefer end of September.  But at present I douirt whether it would be possible during that time for me to go to Canada.BIIXTON.
Paraphrase telegram from the Governor general of the Commonwealth of Australia to tho Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received, Colonial Office, 8.20 p.. u, 14th April, 1920) Most Secret.With reference to your telegram March 27th following from my Prime Minister for prime Minister of United Kingdom begins.   I am greatly surprised at the suggestion that the Prime Ministers should meet at Ottawa in September October this year in the face of the very clear understanding that the meeting was to be held in London next year.   As 1 have made all my arrangements on that basis it will be impossible for me to attend.   In any case as the visit of the Prince of Wales which does not terminate until August precludes my absence I could not leave Austral.!-, as suggested.   Very important work, in Parliament will be interrupted for some weeks by the Prince tb visit and it is imperative that I should after the departure of Hie Royal Highness visit the Pacific Islands in September.   I hope you will find it possible to make arrangements for the Imperial Cabinet meet next year in London as previously agreed (to this) : Hughes. Ends.MUNRO FERGUSON.    .
Paraphrase telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada.(Sant, 4.15 p.m. 28th April, 1920.)28th April. Seoret.Please inform your Acting Prime Minister with referenoe to recent correspondence between Perley and Kowell that Prime Minister of United Kingdom has been in communication with Prime Ministers of New Zealand Commonwealth of Australia and Union of South Africa regarding Canadian Government&apos;s suggestion that n&amp;xfc meeting of Imperial Cabinet and Imperial Conference should be held at Ottawa this year.The replies received show that other Prime Ministers see insuperable difficulties in holding any nesting this year and Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia is most anxious that meeting of Imperial Cabinet should take place in London next year.On the other hand there Rooms to be general agreement that it is most desirable to hold special Constitutional Conference agreed upon under Resolution IX Imperial War Conference 1917 next year.  As to place for meeting of this Conference Union of South Africa, and v&amp; gather Now 2oaland would be&quot;prepared to accept Ottawa and it is pos&amp;ible that above-mentioned objection of Australia may not apply to place of meeting special Conference and might in any case be overcome.In the Giroumatanoes it seems clear (l) that no meeting of Imperial Cabinet can be held this year (2) that meeting of Imperial Cabinet and also special Constitutional Conference should take place next year if possible.Question of place for meetings both of special Conference and Cabinet must remain undecided for the moment.   His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, however, that Government of Canada will keep . open invitation that meeting should take place at Ottawa.MILNSR.
