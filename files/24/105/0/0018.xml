The British Government desire to invite the attention of the Council of the League of Nations to the question of the&apos; use of poisonous and asphyxiating gases in warfare*Great-Britain is at present hound &quot;by the following international agreements on the subject&quot;I$LSl$..f:f &quot;t-lc Regulations respecting the laws and. customs of war on land, annexed to the International Convention signed at The Hague on the 18th October, 1907, which states that it&apos;is particularly forbidden &quot;to employ poison cr poisoned weapons&quot;.Arim.c3.e_25 (j:) i)f the same Regulations, which states that it is particularly forbidden ,;to employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated toc au s o. unn ea 6 s sary su f f erI n g&quot;&apos;.&apos;The International Declaration of 19q7 prohibiting thedischarge of projectiles, and explosives from.balloons (part X&apos;,1 of the instruments signed at the second Peace Conference at The Hague);the preamble of which refers to the powers&quot;being desirous of renewing the Declaration ofThe Hague of the 29th July, 1899, which has newexpired&quot;,, the said [Declaration of the 29th-   July, 1899 declared that&quot;The Contracting powers agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases1&apos;.The German Government was equally bound byglhe aboveDeclarati ons.The use of asphyxiating and poisonous gases during
tho ,rar u a a begun by the Germans in their notorious attack upon tho Canadians in April, 1915 and the use of poison fas bv the Allies was    justified as an act of retaliation against the enemy*In March 1918 a Conference took place at Versailles for tho purpose of dotoinnining the line which should be taken by the Allied Powers in answering an appeal which had boon addressed to all tho hsXligeronts by the International Red Gross to a;;rcejautually to abandon the use of poison gas. The answer which was then drawn up -justified the continued use of this mode of fighting as a measure of retaliation against the enemy, and as a means of fighting which it was useless to abandon so long as there could be no su^e guarantee that the enemy would not again resort to it when it suited his purposeo     The last paragraph of the reply read as follows:-&quot;In shite of all, If the German Government to-day declares that it adheres to the Committee!s proposal and offers new, detailed, and effective guarantees that an agreement to discontinue the use of gas will be observed., the Allied Governments will not refuse to examine its proposals in the most liberal spirit.     But without such guarantees, t: the&quot; &apos; (tiled Governments would fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their opponents of their power to harm&apos;&apos; *The whole of tho Allied reply3 which is a valuable contributioto the literature on this subject, Is attached in the Aunondixo ^ - -Article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles is as follows:-&quot;The use of as phyxi a-tin g - poisonous or other gas and all analogous liquids; materials or devices being prohibited,, their manufacture and importation ar e industries c tly forbidden in:Germany 0The same applies to materials specially intended for the manufacture, storage and use,of the said products or devicesaThe manufacture and the importation into Germany of armoured cars, tanhs and all similar construe-tions suitable for use in war arc also prohibited/&apos;The British Government arc advised that if they desire
to bo free to use poison gas in the o^ent of war, It would be necessary for them to renounce the Land V&apos;ar Contention and the Declaration of 1907 referred to abo^c   They are, however, most reluctant to take so drastic a atop, as they hold the &quot;iew that this, new method of warfare ought no^er to we been employed and they would rejoice to see&apos;it put an onrt to.     Article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles; quoted abo^e. begins with the statement that the use of these gases is prohibited and in these circumstances, the British Government feel that the Allies are morally bound to do all in their power to prohibit their use*On the other hand, unless the prohibition of these gases&apos;is universal among all nations of the world, no country co-Id afford to abandon the experiment nor the equipment of 1 its forces with these gases.   In self-defence e^ery nation will be bound to do its best to keep abreast yrith other countries in research and preparations in order to defend its soldiers and place itself in a position to undertake repri sals*It is for this reason that the British Government &quot;incites the early consideration of the question by the Council of the League of   Nations,&apos; &apos;0*-*
A P I B O I I,USE OF DEjVDIjY   GASES *Answer of Allied gojernnents to Geneva Red Cross&apos;. Prepared&apos; dsy&apos; the Mili tar:f Representatives at Versailles; and approved by&quot; the&quot;V/a3:&quot;&quot;*Cablnet on April 16th&quot;T^&apos;I^ 3 ub ,1 e o V i o &quot;t he&quot; a CM &quot;i To h r e f erred to in lootnofre.The Governments of the Allied Powers, signatories of the Hague Convention, have received in a spirit of sincerest sympathy the appeal which the Committee of the Red Cross has addressed to them with the praiseworthy object of putting an -end, if possible, to the use as a means of war of poisonous and asphyxiating gases.More than any, the Allied Powers associate themselves with the generous and truly humane ideas which in this a3 in other cases inspire the Geneva Committee;   they fully share the Committee^ sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science, instead of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is dally prostituted to the pitiless work of increasing general destruction,It is only too true, as the Committee says, that those who first did not hesitate to invent such means of war as deadly gases assumed, a fearful responsibility*    Once such methods are introduced by one side, the adversary under pains of self-sacrifice cannot refrain from having recourse to them and from seeking to so perfect his use of them^ in order to gain and not suffer mastery.At the beginning of the present war, the Allied Powers believed and had the right to believe with the whole world, that barbarous methods of refined cruelty in war were done with as between civilised nations.    Explicit and solemn pledges had been taken that no use should ever be made of poison or of arms, projectiles or other means of war aiming at the infliction of needless sufferings    With the Committee of the Red Cross, the Allied Powers consider that poisonous and asphyxiating gases are clearly included in this prohibition.The pledge figured in the Convention of vhich various Governments - notably the Imperial German Government -guaranteed loyal execution^     If any value was to be attached tt the word of honour of Sovereign States, no conviction seemed better established than that of the Allied Powers that their troops would not be subjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnished with any equipment to protect them against itvThis was the situation when in April 1915 the Allied Forces were assailed by a new enemy in the shape of deadly gases, first asphyxiating,, then poisonous3 The appalling sufferings caused by this insiduous and treacherous attack have bee^ only too accurately described by the Committee, The German Empire had recourse to methods it had expressly undertaken not to use, and had again broken its word.For months it became the duty of the Allied Powers to seek and to discover means of protecting their troops against these dastardly abominations and to furnish them with the power of resisting their adversaries with equal arms.     This task is now accomplished^In its/
In its oInquoat appeal the Committee pleads for an agreo-raent to be undertaken immediately and loyally upheld by the Armies to stop the use of these gases.With any- other adversary, had such a question been possible, the Allied Powers would not hesitate to give their agreement without.reservation.&apos; They agreed in 1899 and in 1907 and are ready to pledge themselves with any one whose word is kept.*But in dealing with the Gorman -Empire and its subordinates, what guarantee could the Allied Powers hsvp that this new agree-ment would be better kept than its predecessors?   Gould the new agreement be more&apos;explicit and solemn tnsn the previous one, cheerfully betrayed by trie German Empire, as soon as it considered betrayal expedient?In Spite of all, if the German Government to-day declares th.&apos;?.t it adheres to the Committee&apos;s proposal and offers detailed and effective guarantees that &apos;.n agreement to discontinue the use of 6as will be observed, the Allied Governments will not refuse to examine its proposals in tho most liberal spirit.   But without such guarantees, the Allied Governments would, fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their opponents of their power to harm.March 1918.a -When the question came before the War   Cabinet in April 1918, it was decided to approve the answer as drafted subject to an addition making special reference to the question of guarantees by the German Empire and its subordinates, and clearly stating that these must be of an effective and un-questionablo character (War Cabinet 39Z (9)).
