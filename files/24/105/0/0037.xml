SECRET.CABINET.PRE-WAR    PENSIONS     COMMITTEE.REPORTTERMS Ol1 REFERENCE.SCOPE OS ENQUIRY,X*    The Committee was set up &quot;by decision ox the Cabinet, held on 11th Maroh, 1920 (Cabinet 14 (20) Conclusion 2) to consider whether any steps can be taken to relieve&quot;exceptional cases of hardship among pre-war pensioners......due., for example., to age and infirmity&quot;, and present the following unanimous report.II.   The Committee has taken evidence from the various Departments concerned, and has been supplied with particulars, such as the number, grading, etc., of the different classes of pro-war pensioners and the schemes under which the pensions are paid.   Speaking generally, the scope of the enquiry has extended to pre-war pen-sioners falling into the following main categories(1)   Naval and Military pensioners;(2)   Civil Service pensioners;(3)   Police pensioners&apos;;(4)   Bx-teashore. The total number of these pensioners is approximately 140,000, of whom about 110,000 are sixty years of age and upwards, or have been retired before that age for reasons of disability.   Any concessions made will fall to be charged upon the Exohequer except in the ease of the English and Scotchpolice
pnlice&apos;, only half of whoso pensions are chargeable to ? j Imperial funds; the rest falling to be mot from local*sources.III.        In the course of its deliberations, the Committee investigated various schemes which have /been submitted to it, and har, been impressed by the great difficulty of evolving a workable scheme which would at once satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the pre-war pensioner falling within the terms of reference, and at the same time would not lmbose a wholly unjustifiable burden on the Exchequer,   It should be noted that the Committee is not concerned with the grant of pensions to persons who did not actually receive pensions before the war, e^en though in similar circumstances such persons would now be eligible for pension benefits.   On the other hand the Committee has felt bound to take account of pensioners whose pen-sions ha^e been increased since the outbreak of the war though to a substantially less extent than the pensions awarded to similar pensioners under schemes now in force,XV, Under tho terms of reference assistance must^be confined to exceptional cases of hardsttLp, and it is of the greatest importance that the qualifying circumstances should be defined by as broad conditions as possible so as to reduce investigation into Individual circumstances. The evidence before the Committee indicates the Inpractic-ability of basing any scheme on a distinction &quot;between pensions assumed to ha^e been awarded on a subsistence basis, and those awarded simply as some recognition of s service.   In this connection it should he remembered that*the various classes of pensioners differ greatly.   The soldier, sailor and policeman is retired while in the prime of life, and when as a rule he is:able to maintain himself in remunerative civil employment.   The civil servant andmthe teacher, on the other hand, normally&apos; retire after their life&apos;s work is done at the age of sixty, or, thereabouts.
1   163-&quot; p-V. / After &quot;ery careful review of the material before it, the Committee ha^e arrived at the conclusion that the question of hardship must in each case be determined by reference to tho following considerations(a)-Service and age of pensionerj(b) Amount of pension;(c) Circumstances of pensioner:-(i)   &quot;/nether married or single; (ii)   Amount of means apart from pension,VI. The Committee recommends that in order to qualify for relief, a, pre-war pensioner shall (1) ha^e been pensioned on retirement for age or ha^e completed the term of service required to earn a full service pension, or ha^e been invalided out of the service before completion of that term; and (2) shall bea 4sixty years of age or o^er unless he has been invalided out of the service;   Widows in receipt of pensions granted in respect of services rendered by deceased husbands may be granted the increase at the age of 40.VII. Tne Committee has felt bound both by the terms of reference and by the need for keeping the cost of the scheme within moderate dimensions to fix a rigorous maximum limit of means, and, after ^ery careful consideration: recommends that the benefits of the scheme should be granted only to those pensioners whose total means, inclusive of pension and of any pension bonus gi^en under this report, do not exceed In the case of a married man  200 per annum and in the case of a single man  150 per annum in all.   Subject to the recommendations contained in paragraph IX respecting the private means of pensioners, and subject also to the general o^er-riding condition that the total moans (including pension and pension bonus under this scheme)&apos; shall not be raised in the case of a single man abo^e  150 per annum, and in the case of a married&apos;man abo^e  200 per annum,
the Committee recommends that relief shall be granted to pensioners satisfying the conditions laid down in paragraphvl on the following scales-Grade (i)   Pensions of  50 a year or less to beincreased by 50$ whether the recipient is single or married^,Grade (il) Pensions of  51- 100 or if) to be increased .&quot;pensioner married of     ) by 40$  Dl- 130t )Grade (111).Pensions of  101- 10?, or ) to be increasedlp&quot; penc;practitioner married    ) by 30$of  131- 200. In order to ar*oid the difficulty that a pensioner -under this scheme in receipt of a pension of, .say,  51 per annum would, by reason of the change of percentage get less increase than a pensioner with a pension of  50 per annum, the Committee recommends that, subject,, of course,.to the operation of the o^er-riding maxima of  150 and  200, the pension as Increased under the scheme shall in no case be 3.ess than the maximum pension plus bonus increase payable to a pensioner in the grade below *   Thus a pensioner in Grade (ii) with a pension of  51 will ha**e his pension raised to  75 the equivalent of the  50 pension plus 50$ increase of a pensioner entitled to the maximum Grade (i) rate.- A pensioner whose pension i&apos;s  54 per annum,,, will,. however, take the 40$ increase of Grade (il), as that is more favourable to him than the 50$ on the pension of  50*per annum.It is estimated that if means other than pension are altogether disregarded.. the total number of pensioners who are now in receipt of pensions of  200 per annum and under is about Io2r.C00j of these 102,000 are aged 60 or o^er,- or retired for disability6
The asr^regate cost of the  resent, pensions of thci I0&amp;,09Qindividuals amounts tc  4;280;000 and assuming that all .,   A u&quot; would benefit under ths abovs scale the cost of increasing their pensions would be about  2,000,000 par annum, from which would fall to be deducted the local contribution in respect of the Police.    It must be borna in mind that this amount will frtso ho reduced by the tiperation   of the means disqualification but it is not possible,, in the absence of information as to the private means&apos;of the pensioners to estimate even approximately the extent of this reduction.[CIRCUMSTANCES VIII,   The Commit tee considers that in granting exceptional OF PENSIONERS,relief to meet t2&apos;-iix a cost of living in ^ases of hardship, account may properly be taken of the circumstances of the marriage.individual pensioner.   At the same time, it is clearly im-practicable to treat each case strictly on merit, and on the whole it is felt that substantial justice will be attained by giving the married pensioners whose pensions exceed  ;0 per annum a somewhat higher rate of relief than similar unmarried pensioners.    For this purpose, a widower, unless he has children under l6 dependent upon him, will bo treated as &quot;unmarried&quot;.Private     IX,        It is proposed that in all rcases falling within the Means.scheme account shall be taken of private means, whether the latter are &quot;earned&quot; or &quot;unearned&quot; .    In order to ascertain the pensioner&apos;s circumstances., it will be necessary to obtain from every pensioner under the scheme a sworn declaration as to circumstances showing whether he is married, single or a widower and in the latter ?ase whether he has depen^e -*t children under l6 and also giving particulars of occupation, total means, etc,  .It is suggested that the system of calculating means in m operation in the case of-old age pensions should so far asposssible be. adopted and that in particular lump sum grants pa,t 1 on retirement in addition to pensions should be treated as cjapital on the lines laid down for old age pensioners,

Pen-WAR.sioners who have been granted some increase during the war should bo   eligible for tho benefits of thrt scheme but it may f) be neoessary for administrative reasons to restrict this ex-torsion to cas^s who re the benefits of the scheme are substantially greater than those now enjoyed by the pensioners..EX-OFFICERS XI.        The pensions of such Officers or men of the Navy andAND MEN OFNAVY AND      Army as hav-  in the past been disabled by neace-time injuries AR^Y DIS-ABLED BY      and are pensioners, should be raised to the level of the post-PEACE-TIMEINJURIES.     war Warrants (but without allowances for wives or children) if this would bo more favourable to them than thrt scale indicated in paragraph VII and that meanwhile the scale should apply to them.MACHINERY.   XII.       The Committee recommends that an Inter-Departmental Committeo should be appointed to consider the best machinery for giving effect to the abov   re commendat ions * It is however -  ,        suggested that the work of investigation and payment should be entrusted to the Departments responsible for paying the existing pensions and that the Treasury should have a determination-ing voice as regards doubtful cases and should exeroise general control and supervision 3S as to secure that the scheme is worked on uniform lines.LEGISLATION. XIII.   The above proposals will if approved involve legisla-tion and it is suggested that the legislation should take the form of empowering (l) the Treasury or Pension Authority by Orders in Council to grant additions to pensions payable by the State on the lines and within the maxima recommended above, ane (2) Local Authorities to grant additions to pensions payable bj them within the same maxima. Subject to legislative sanction0 being obtained it is suggested that effect should be given to.  the proposed conoossions? as from 1st April,, 1920-.(Signed;   L.
