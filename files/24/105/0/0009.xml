&apos;ION IN MEKP OF SPVTSg EEPBBNAL AGGRESSION ON THEADMIFAI/PY MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET o1*       The Admiralty have had under consideration Foreign Office Telegrams No, 411 from Lord Acton- 18th April, 1920, Noo 430 from Lord Acton, 25th April, 1920, No, P.W, 10 from General Turner, Riga to War Office. 17th March, 1920 and Telegrams Nos* 155 and 154 from S.N.0, Baltic, 22nd March, 1920, attached.2*       From very reliable and secret information it is ascertained that the Bolshevik Baltic Fleet is preparing for sea and proposes to go for a cruise when ice is clear of Gulf of Finland, ostensibly for practices, but in reality to demonstrate against the Finnish and Baltic States.3* In accordance with Cabinet decision of 31st Ma^ch, 1920 instructions have been given to the Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, Rear-Admiral Sir- VU Cowan, to the effect that no offensive action is to be taken against the Bolshevik Fleet.4*       On 24th February the Allied Governments, however, decided that in the event of the Soviet Government taking offensive action against any of the Baltic States within the limits of the legitimate frontiers of these States the Allies would give them every possible support,5*       These two policies are not consistent.6.       In view of the declared Allied Russian policy as stated above, and of the probability of the proposed Bolshevik Naval   demonstration against Finland&apos;developing from passive   into active Naval pressure:, the Admiralty consider that a clear and definite understanding should  be arrived at as to the attitude to be adopted by the British Naval forces in such an eventuality.   Are they to remain passive on-lookers3 or is the S,N,0, Baltic to resist such aggression by all the Naval means in his power in the latter case it&quot; will be necessary to send considerable Naval reinforcements to the Baltic,7*       A situation similar to that of last year will arise, with the added disadvantage to the British forces that the Esthonian ports will not be available.   The Esthonlan Government have concluded a Treaty with the Soviet Government a secret clause in which denies the use of their Ports.tc our vessels of war.   It is considered most undesirable to send heavy ships into the Baltic owing to the risk from mines and tl the lack of harbours in which they can lie; action against the Soviet ships would therefore take the form of Submarines and defensive mining of the waters of the Gulf of Finland,Such operations neccessitate the use of a large number of subs idfcary craft and cannot be undertaken at   a moment&apos;s notice,   Moreover, the expense would be great and the Service unpopular,8*        In this connection it will be remembered that the Cabinet decided on 31st March, 1920- that &quot;the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should examine the Baltic situation, with special reference to the probable behaviour &apos; of the Bolshevik Fleet, and report to the Cabinet&quot;,(Intlid) W.H.L.1,5,20,

Paraphrase *P .W. 10 cipher MarcH 17th *Secret service agent reports that with intentions of harassing Finland and Latvian ports and inducing these countries to accept unfavourable terms of peace, Bolsheviks are preparing their fleet for sea and that Bolsheviks believe that British Fleet will not intervene with, present policy of British Government. It is impossible to say how reliable this report may be, in any case it is a contingency wMch should be guarded against a   ttould request to be informed what action the British Naval Force would take in such an event and whether in the near future any protective measures are likely to be taken. Would strongly recommend an official warning given to Soviet Government that any such aggressive measures will mean intervention of British Fleet, and continuance of blockade. All that would probably be required is a message of that kind.
