PHIS DOOUMgHT IS &apos;Jlfl PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAWHIO MAJISa&amp;&apos;S GOV3RHMESNT).SORE Tt 0, A BIN E Jh.P.-1810. POSITION   01-&apos;   njHB   BLIND.A statement of the case to bo submitted to theof the Blind,Sir,I am directed, on behalf of the Executive Council of the National League of the Blind, and also in the interests of the men who hare undertaken the March on London, to briefly place before you the reasons which have compelled us to adopt the extraordinary steps herein referred to, for the purpose of directing the attention of the public and that of the Government to the present unsatisfactory social and industrial conditions obtaining in the Blind community.We respectfully submit to you the view that all the statistical evidence available indicates conclusively that mere voluntary charity has hopelessly failed to meet the requirements of the Blind *When it is remembered that of the 34,965 blind persons in the British Isles not more than 2,000 of this number are employed in the special institutions existing for this purpose, and when it is further remembered that 10,000 also of this number are dependent upon Poor Law agencies, and not more than an additional 5,000 engaged in casual occupations, we submit the foregoing statement is more than proven.   In addition, when we suggest that quite 12,000 sightless folk are totally incapacitated&apos; owing to their blindness and other physical and mental limitations, we feel sure you will be compelled, however reluctantly, to admit that the conditions cited do not reflate a happy state of affairs.We have tried every legitimate means that thoughtful consideration and propaganda methods are able to suggest, for , the purpose of directing the attention of the public and that of the Government to these facts, but so far as we are concerned\ no sensible attempt has yet been made to grapple with the problem in a comprehensive fashions \From 1906 onward, deputations from this League have waited upon Government departments, with a view to emphasising our claims and urging the&quot;necessity for.the provision of such legislative machinery as would be capable of relieving the pressure of bad conditions, or better still, of removing the evils of which we have legitimate cause to complain.On behalf of my colleagues, I respectfully but firmly submit, that no real effort has been made by the Government to
I59meet the situation, despite the-, fact, that we know we have developed a tremendous volume of publie ^opliilon fa^urable-&quot;to definite action being taken.Since the year 1902. resolutions from the Trade Union,.  Congress, the Co-operative Congress, and other and additional large organisations have signified to the Government the desires we are endeavouring to express here to-day, but nothing appreciable has been no one.In March 1914, by a resolution of the House of Commons, the Government is required to take immediate steps for the purpose of dealing with the grievous situation, and in order we were told, to promote this end, an Inter-departmental Committee was set up, which reported in 1917.   This Report, and the recommendations oontained therein,, though oiuy partially meeting the needs of the situation, has been productive of scanty advantage to us, and we are here to-day earnest, in-Distent and determined no longer to submit to the perpetuation of the bad conditions by which are lives are environed.I shall be told, and my oolleagues will be asked to believe, that the Ministry of Health has already taken in hand this problem, and that a useful beginning has thus been made. I want to submit, however, with all the energy and foroefulness of which I am capable, that the hardships and disabilities of our lives have no more been mitigated by such action, than ,the course of a stream can be diverted by the mere expression of the will to change its course.Grants in aid, in our judgment, such as we are getting In the form of a paltry pittance of  250,000 per annum, to deal with the requirements of praotically 85,000 people, offers the flimsiest justification for its conduct that any Government oould possibly oonceive.      Neither in substance or particular, have we or do we signalise our approval of the methods adopted. Even if the whole of the money had been utilised to confer por-sonal benefits upon the Blind, the arrangement would not and could not be satisfactory;   but as one who has had a good deal to do with the allocation of such monies, I realise fully how unsatisfactory the -hole business is.    Administrative charges are eating, up this pittance, while the condition of the necessitous blind remains absolutely unaltered.I am aware that in the absence of legislation, nothing of an appreciable character can be hoped for, end it is because of this consideration that we press for an enactment which will be at once comprehensive in the scope of its operations, and liberal in its provision.   I say liberal, because of the
V60characteristic illiberal it y which ban doirinat ed the actions of the Government in delaying to deal with the problem that is over-ripe for eolation.If rumour is correct; however, perhapue I ought to &quot;ay, what was a rumour a month a?o, has now crystallised into a definite statement.     The cSee C.P.ll60     Government propose introducing a Bill of their own.and it is to the provisions of that Bill that I ajr anxious the attention of the Rt. Hon. Gentleman should be directed^Firstly, may I be permitted to postulate the contention that wo have no faith in what i* eallod &quot;permissive legislation &quot;     Our unfortunate associations with the Poor Law and its administration., nas dissipated any opt imism whi eh we mitht have entertained on that soore.     And, moreover, the provisions of the new/Mu cation Act are in like degree, equally disappointing,     Any reactionary local authority in now able, and will continue to be able to ovado its responsibility for giving training and ultimate employment to blind po-vpj. e, and therefore while we may have a few en light one d local adminSst rat inns fully alive to the duties which devolve upon them, the majority will prove adamant.T7e are fully determined therefore, to resist to the utmost cf our strength, the repetition of whet Las happened under the Pour Lav/, and we beg leave to say to you, Sir, that any faith we have in the good intentions of the Government in respect of this problem will be wholly and entirely dissipated, unless we are assured that&apos; there will be such a strengthening of the clauses dealing with Technical Education, Employment and Relief; as will make it incumbent upon the local authority to do the things required by the spirit and intention of the Bill,We claim that the Treasury and the local authority should jointly prcvJdc the whole cor,i 0? training and maintenance during the period of training, for the adult Blind, and that we the Bill recently given a second reading in the House of Commons, and known as the Technical Uduoption, Employment and Maintenance o^ the Blind Bill, is a modest, unpretentious effort to deal with the situation.     It by no means represents the sons i dor ed opinions and aspirations of the Organisation of the Blind;    indeed, it spells but the minimum of our requiremento.     It has some omissions and many defects, from our point of view, but being anxious to make a reasonably decent beginning we ac epted a Compromise with the charitable Institutions of the country, by which they are enabled to give their support to the Bill.
ought not to &quot;be forced to go cap-in-hand to a voluntary association asking for the means &quot;by which we can subsequently gain the equipment designed to transform us into useful citizens,   just as &quot;blindness is a national calamity, so we contend that the contingent responsibilities folltvmng in its train should be undertaken and fully discharged by the community.Having said m much in respect of the technical training and employment of the Blind, may I venture to suggest that inasmuch as the earning capacity of eight-less people is seriously depleted by reason of the haudi-cap placed upon them,  that the State should have regard to that fact and, as far as ia humanly possible, make up to us in pounds, shillings and fcence,for the limitations we have to encounter.   It should be remembered, Sir, in this connection, that even those blind folk who are employed in the industrial institutions, are engaged under the pernicious system of piece-work.   I 3ay pernicious, in its application to us,Since it has &quot;been recognised by the Inter-departmental committee on the Welfare c&apos;f the Blind and Other authoritive bodies, that the handicap imposes a limitation in the matter of output of something between 33 and 5o per cent, you will readily understand, Sir, that since our wages are determined under such condi-tions we cannot be expected to decently exist upon unaided earning capacity.   A Compensation for Blindness grant should be made therefore, which will be commen-commensurate with the handicap imposed, and there would be no difficulty in reasonably assessing such a disability.I understand that this consideration is altogether ignored in the Government Bill, and that is, from our point of view, one of the fundamental defects of your pro-posals, and involves the taking up of a position by the Government to which we are not prepared to submit.Finally, may I also say something about those unfortunate&apos; sightless people who are suffering from additional physical or mental disabilities, and who are, in consequence, partially or totally incapacitated.It is proposed, I understand   to confer an allow-ance of 10/- per week upon all such persons between 50 and 70 years of age, ana that on reaching the last named period they will automatically be transferred to the Old Age Pensions authority.   Think of it, Sir, - lo/- - a week in these days to a person so handicapped, and you hope to bring the 5,000 blind persons out of the Union workhouses because a of this grant, and by reason of
the fact that under the Old Age Pensions Anondw     *ot-&quot;,Toot? Law disabilities have been removed.   . It is&apos; ... hone &quot;thatmacs the heart sick&quot;.Hero again, the trifling sum Involved by the provisions of what we call &quot;Mr. Tillett&apos;s Kill,&quot; has been variously estimated...   ..I have commuted that it would cost about  2,OCX1,000, but I believe the view is entertained at the ministry of Health that it would cost something in the re &quot;/ion of  1,800,000 nor- annum.     This, and other considerations, prompt me to urge that the Government will be wise and will reflect the wishes of the great community they are said to represent, if they take courage and introduce a bold, comprehensive, liberal Lie a sure, designed to deal with this problem .ancl to settle the difficulties once and for all times.By the provision of liberal education, by the security of employment, by assisting those upon whom nature or circumstance has laid a heavy burden, the State would contribute to its greatness&apos; and to its ultimate efficiency, and believe me,. Sir,, these are the real things about which we ought to be concerned in the last resort.The pitiable spectacle of sightless people standing in our streets asking alms, in order that they may subsist, does not surely harmonise with the conception of real greatness.     The Government Bill; so far as I have been able to understand its provisions and intentions, will not rid us of this and kindred evils, and because of this and for the reasons already adduced, I claim your sympathy and practical support in enabling us to re-shape and re-mould the machinery which will be requisite for the solution of this problem.You will thereby have; really done something to help us to reduce our disabilities, to a minimum, and to make it possible for us to li^e a free and highly developed life.It is essential before c ample-;, in;  this statement, that particular attention should be directed to the conditions obtaining in the blind community of Ireland. According to the last Census returns there were 4,512 to- . tally blind persons in Ireland, and 1,309 partially blind, giving a total of 5,621,     It must be noted that less than 300 adults are permanently employed on wayes altogether insufficient for their proper maintenance; even the Poor Law in this country is much less generous both in its provisions and administration.  , Poor Law authorities cannot contribute more than  13 per annum to-wards the maintenance of sightless adults, and the voluntary charities, being; notoriously poor, it follows that the conditions are just about as bad as
they very well can be, . The 3canty wages that are being paidare resulting in an ever-incTensina; number having to go intothe streets for the purpose of ashing alias* and wo are convincedthat any legislation undertaken by the Government should haveregard to these facts and ought to place the Blind of ireland on the same basis as that obtaining, or likely to obtain in Uila-,.,.,country. .2t Whitehall Gardens S .W, May 5rd, 1920.
