Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Notes on the Industrial Councils.Since the middle of January, at which date the progress of the Joint Industrial Council movement was last touched upon in this Report, the number of Councils officially recognised by the Ministry has been increased by seven. The Interim Reconstruction Committees for the glass industry and the cooperage industry have been reconstituted as Industrial Councils. Councils have been set up for the surgical instrument making trade and for process engraving, and an unofficial Council for the soap and candle industry has adopted an improved constitution and received recognition by the Ministry. The two remaining Industrial Councils have been set up for industrial establishments under the Government, the first for those under the Air Ministry, and the second for those under the Ministry of Munitions. The life of the latter Council, however, cannot be long, in view of the decision to bring the Ministry of Munitions to a close.During the earlier months of 1920 the Industrial Councils have naturally been largely occupied with the question of wages, in consequence of the general stream of demands for increases which have been made during the period. But their activities have been directed in a marked degree to many other matters, less prominent for the moment, but equally important. The introduction of the new Unemployment Insurance Bill has occupied the attention of a large number of the Councils, who have been considering the(C 1992)  150  5/20 H &amp; S 2D
introduction of schemes for &quot; contracting out.&quot;   The problems connected with apprentice-ship, and with training in general, are also now attracting a very considerable degree of attention.  A number of important agreements have been reached on these subjects. On these matters, as well as safety, welfare and others, the practice of consultation between -the Councils and government departments continues to make headway.The inevitable difficulties which the Industrial Councils encounter in the course of their activities are perhaps as illuminating as their successes, for the future of the Whitley movement must depend largely on the method in which they are overcome. In several cases these difficulties have resulted, for the time being, in a cessation of the Councils activities. Thus, for example, the Council for the sawmilling industry have continued to find difficulty in obtaining observance of their wages agreements throughout the industry. The obstacle has proved sufficiently serious to lead, at the instance of the employers&apos; side, to a suspension of the Councils meetings for six months. The workers&apos; side are of opinion that the problem might be met by establishing a Trade Board side by side with the Council, as is the case already in the hollow-ware industry. Discussion on these lines may perhaps provide an acceptable solution. In the vehicle-making industry, the Council have been faced by a rather more unusual difficulty. One of the employers&apos; associations desired larger representation on the Council. To this a second employers&apos; association were unable to agree, whereupon the first association resigned from the Council. As the Scottish employers had already withdrawn, this leaves the Council in a rather precarious position. The employees&apos; side are anxious that the Council should continue, and by agreeing to exclude wages questions from the scope of the Councils activities, it may be kept in continuance. The question of the adequacy of the Council from the point of view of Scottish interests, has led, in the case of the Council for the carpet industry and that for bobbin and shuttle making, to the resignation of the Scottish emplo^ers.  These Councils, however, are continuing their operations.In all such cases, the Department are endeavouring, not without prospects of success, to maintain the existence of the Councils, whose vitality indeed has on several occasions proved sufficient to survive differences equally serious. The work of the Council for electrical contracting, for example, has been disturbed by a difference of opinion between the employers&apos; and the operatives&apos; sides on the question of refusal to endorse the working rules adopted by the Liverpool District Council. In consequence of a deadlock the representatives of the Electrical Trades Union withdrew from the Council. They have now returned, and the Council is continuing. The Council for the made-up leather goods industry, in spite of a difference of opinion between the employers&apos; and the workers&apos; side over the proposal to set up a Trade Board, is still to remain in operation. The Boad Transport Council, almost since its formation, has met with difficulties owing to the employers&apos; argument that the CounciFs agreements cannot be made binding on non-federatecl employers. The Council have survived all the difficulties. The Tramways Council, also, has faced a difficult situation successfully. On a demand by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a general increase of the war bonus by ten shillings, a compromise was effected by the Council. Certain employers and sections of the men would not accept this settlement and local strikes resulted. The Joint Industrial Council, however, reached a final settlement by confirming the national advances which they had established, and at the same time requesting District Councils to endeavour to fix, within a month, basic rates for their areas.A development of some interest is the proposal that an association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees shall be formed. One of the main motives, it would appear, behind the movement is the desire that wages and other agreements of these bodies should be given legal force. At a meeting held in January at the invitation of - the Pottery Council, resolutions were passed asking the various Councils and Committees to express their opinion on the necessity for legislation to make their agreements binding, and declaring that, in order to develop the industrial organisa-tions recommended in the Whitley Beport, an association should be formed. A provisional committee was appointed to draw up a draft constitution and proposed that the association should be voluntary in the first instance and should have power to seek incorporation under the provisions of the Companies Acts. Its objects are to include the establishment of a central office and the consideration of legislation affecting the interests of associated bodies. Some thirty Councils and Committees have hitherto expressed their opinion on this project, which, it would appear, are not very acceptable. The majority have definitely refused to join such an association, while several have decided to take no steps for the present. Only a few have given general support, but several bodies have expressed approval so far as the acquisition of compulsory powers is involved.  The Council for
Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.May Bay.Articles, retrospective and prospective, under the general title of &quot; May Day,&quot; appear in most of the papers reviewed this week, and the &quot; Socialist,&quot; &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; publish special May Day numbers. In the majority of these articles there is little that is worthy of notice, but some of the articles in &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Socialist &quot; are admirable presentations of the ideas and policies of the National Socialist Party and the Socialist Labour Party respectively, while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; articles are valuable as an index to current I.L.P. opinions.The leading article of the &quot; Socialist &quot; is devoted to praise of the Third International and criticism of the English exponents of the Second International, but in this the &quot; Socialist&quot; is no more remarkable than &quot; The Call.&quot; More interesting is an article by Mr. Sean McLoughlin on the relations between &quot; Communist Unity &quot; and the Revo-lution. He urges that the formation of a united communist party need not necessarily mark any advance towards the revolution. He insists that the only thing any socialist party in Britain can do to-day is to carry on propaganda and educate the workers in the principles and methods of socialism, and regards the many quarrels between the various socialist parties as to their respective orthodoxy in the light of a waste of energy. His attitude is : it does not matter who agitates, provided that the maximum amount of agitation among non-socialist workers is done. The heat of the revolution itself, he trusts, will be sufficient to weld the various propagandist bodies into one efficient revo-revolutionary organisation. &quot; It will require some big event to bring about the transition stage from sentiment to reality.&quot; It will thus be seen that Mr. McLoughlin believes the socialist revolution will come, not through the endeavours of a homogeneous revolutionary party, but rather through the inevitable self-destructive tendencies of the capitalist system. In other parts of this paper significant contributions appear from Mr. Gallacher and Mr. J. T. Murphy, from which it is easy to conclude that there will be no change in the attitude of the Socialist Labour Party on the question of Communist Unity.The special number of &quot; Justice &quot; is equally useful in illustrating the principles of the National Socialist Party. In a special article Mr. H. M. Hyndman refers to the chaotic condition of international socialism and concludes that before the international socialist movement can be properly reconstructed, the separate nationalities must come to an understanding within their own borders as to what socialism means. He then expresses the opinion.that we have no really powerful and accredited socialist party in Great Britain. The first duty, therefore, of the National Socialist Party is to establish the Labour Party as the socialist party in Great Britain ; only when this has been done will it be wise to enter into the international socialist movement. This opinion of Mr. Hyndman is endorsed by &quot; Justice &quot; in a leading article. Two features in both articles may be noted: firstly, the Labour Party is to be confirmed as the elect instrument of the Co-operative Commonwealth; secondly, the opinion is expressed in both articles that the Government is ready to provoke premature revolutionary action, and is con-sidering &quot; organised terrorism &quot; of the people. Mr. R. C. Morrison in this paper welcomes the joining of the London Co-operative Societies in the May Day demonstrations. He thinks that their entry into the Labour movement is valuable in that they will form a balancing force against the left wing. &quot; The greatest danger in the Labour movement to-day is the number of young adherents who possess but a superficial knowledge of political and industrial history and of economics.&quot;The leading article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; on May Day is significant of the I.L.P.(0 1992) 2 D 2match manufacture, however, have suggested that the Ministry should set up a national council representative of the Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.In two important directions the Whitley scheme has shown itself to be acceptable. The Court of Inquiry on Dock Labour held that time was ripe for forming immediately a Joint Industrial Council, District Councils and Works Committees for the industry. The National Federation of General Workers meeting in conference, on the 8th April, considered the continuance of the affiliated unions&apos; association with the Whitley Councils. A resolution was passed agreeing with the general principle of the Councils. The sug-gestion was also made that a conference should be held between representatives of these unions and various Councils to revise means of making Councils more useful to the workers.
attitude. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; congratulates itself that the insularity of British Labour is disappearing, but it is confessed that much more progress must be made before it can be said that &quot; British Labour is at one in spirit with its fellow-workers in all lands.&quot; In characteristic fashion greetings are conveyed to Russia, Ireland, Japan, India, and the workers of Central Europe. The way in which the LL.P. seeks to prove the sincerity of its internationalism is by neglecting its own country. The two most remarkable articles in this paper are contributed by Mr. Thomas Johnson and Mr. F. Hodges. Mr. Johnson describes the recent general strike organised by the Irish Labour Party and their embargo on exports of certain foodstuffs. British workers are asked to profit by the Irish example, and it is suggested that 48 hours&apos; inaction on their part could bring the Irish workers their freedom. Mr. F. Hodges describes the miners&apos; international movement. He apparently hopes for a time when a miners&apos; international federation by use of the economic, as opposed to the political, weapon will be able to exercise a controlling influence on the international relations of the nations of the world. The way in which the pro-vincial miners&apos; organisations have been united in national bodies leads him to think that not much effort will be required to fuse the national bodies into a &quot; solid international phalanx.&quot; It can hardly be said that the present position of the M.F.G.B. justifies Mr. Hodges&apos; optimism. Mr. Hodges is equally optimistic in hoping that a miners&apos; international movement for better working conditions and pay for miners will create &quot; in the breast of the coal miners of the world a new moral and social outlook which will change the world&apos;s morality.&quot; Like the writers to the &quot; Socialist&quot; and to &quot; Justice,&quot; Mr. Hodges believes in the inevitability of the Social Revolution, but here he is not so optimistic: this &quot; will not take place at the appointed hour; years of hard work are before us.&quot; The leading article in the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; may be quoted as a refreshing antidote to the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; This paper confesses that the Labour movement has in the last year been tried and found wanting in many important matters. It is recognised that the miners have failed to carry the bulk of the trade unions with them in their attempt to turn the trade union movement into new channels.National Labour Party.The preliminary agenda of the annual conference of the National Labour Party which is to take place at Whitsuntide at Scarborough is dealt with in many papers. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; bases upon it his usual criticism of the trade unions for not making sufficient financial sacrifice for the sake of the party as a whole. The number of resolutions from local Labour parties and socialist societies he takes as a proof of the fact that it is these members of the Labour Party who really take an interest in its work. This same fact of the numerous resolutions upon the preliminary agenda is regarded as a weakness of the Party by the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and the &quot; New Age.&quot; The remark of the &quot; New Age&quot; is: &quot;an agenda such as this is an invitation to capitalism to carry on without fear.&quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; says that nine-tenths of the resolutions are identical with those put before the Trades Union Congress, and suggests that this repetition and overlapping should be avoided. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; regards the agenda as a sign of rank and file inefficiency. In the opinion of this paper this dissipation of energy on the part of the branches leaves the national executive of the party uncontrolled. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; would like the branches to concentrate upon one or two topics of importance. The &quot; New Age &quot; and the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; pick out for special commendation the resolution emanating from Richmond with regard to financial credit; the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; commends a resolution condemning the performances of employment exchanges and calling for them to be placed under the control of trade unions.It was noticed at the time of the municipal elections last November that the Labour and Socialist press was considerably disturbed on account of the successes of the Labour Party in these elections. It was feared that the new Labour councillors might not at first prove equal to the task set before them. This week, in &quot; Forward,&quot; &quot; Rob Roy &quot; takes a similar line in discussing the prospect of a general election. The Secretary of State for War&apos;s speech at Sunderland on the 3rd January this year, with regard to the fitness of the Labour Party to govern the country, has hitherto been universally con-demned in these papers. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; however, expresses the opinion that Mr. Churchill&apos;s criticism was legitimate, if he meant that there was &quot; a lot of hard work and hard thinking to be done in the way of creating smooth administrative machinery and of running that machinery without too much friction towards an agreed end.&quot; &quot; Rob Roy &quot; concludes : &quot; The little delay in a general election will not do the Labour Party any harm if the time is well spent.&quot;
Trade Union Movement.The attack upon the official trade union organisations continues to be the feature of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; The South Wales correspondent to this paper devotes his weekly article to suggesting that the S.W.M.F; should put forward a new demand for a  2 per week increase in wages, irrespective of the recent national award. The rank and file are warned that their executive will prefer to press for a reversion to the old conciliation board agreement. A demand of this latter kind is regarded as a retrograde step in that it might &quot; increase the incentive to production.&quot; A new feature in this paper is a series of notes from a Scottish mining correspondent, who is equally critical of the miners&apos; unions.   In particular he makes an attack upon Mr. Frank Hodges.The second reading debate on the Trade Union Ballot Bill is noticed in the &quot; Demo-crat,&quot; the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; All these papers are hostile to the Bill. The remark of the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is typical of this paper : &quot; the working classes cannot trust the fairness of Government nominees.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is quite as critical of the Labour opposition to this Bill as it is of the Bill itself. The unfounded deduction is made from the speeches of the Labour members that the Labour Party would be disposed to accept without much protest a Government measure on the lines of this Bill, but of a compulsory, instead of an adoptive, character. The equally unfounded remark is made that the Minister of Labour gave this Bill his support.The Budget.&quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; New Age &quot; deal with the Chancellors Budget speech for the first time this week. The &quot; New Age &quot; describes the Budget as &quot; the most impudent capitalist Budget on record,&quot; regards the protest against the E.P.D. as merely a matter of tactics, and declares that the net effect of the Budget will be to raise the cost of living. In &quot; Forward,&quot; articles appear from Mr. J. C. Wedgwood, M.P., and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, both hostile to the Budget. Mr. Wedgwood adopts the statement in the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; last week that the figures of the Budget statement have been &quot; cooked,&quot; but his actual detailed criticism is copied from last week&apos;s &quot; New Statesman.&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald&apos;s conclusion is that the Budget imposes burdens on the wage earner heavier than he has ever borne before. On the other hand, &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in this paper, expresses the opinion that the Budget is a more workmanlike production than we were entitled to expect, and believes that Labour ought to be gratified at the increase in the E.P.D. and at the imposition of the corporation tax. It is especially worthy of note that &quot; Roy Roy &quot; points, out that two-thirds of the new taxation will be derived from direct taxes. It will be remembered last week that the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; arrived at a conclusion that 80 per cent, of the new taxation was indirect. Of the particular proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it may be noted that the corporation tax is generally condemned on the ground that it is a flat-rate tax, while the excess profits duty is criticised on the ground that the cost of this tax is in reality borne by the consumer. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald regards the duty as a licence from the State to the trading firm to profiteer. The proposed application of the corporation tax to co-operative societies does not meet with much attention in these papers, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald being the principal person to refer to it. Mr. Macdonald, however, makes the mistake of assuming that it will be applied to the gross profit of co-operative societies and will thus mean a tax of Is. in the pound on co-operative society &quot;dividends&quot; or, more strictly speaking, on distributions of bonuses on purchases. The &quot; Nation &quot; devotes an article to the exposition of the virtues of a capital levy.Government Policy.The criticisms of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, the Ministry of Transport and the new Profiteering Bill may be noted. Mr. C. Jesson, M.P., discusses in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; the amendment added to the Unemployment Insurance Bill in Standing Com-mittee C, allowing all approved societies under the Health Insurance Acts to administer the Unemployment Insurance scheme. Mr. Jesson makes an attempt to defend this amendment in the interests of the liberty of working men. He argues that the Bill will give trade union officials power to give or withhold employment to their members, and he asks what chance of employment would a member of a trade union get who claimed exemption from paying the political levy where this exists. He suggests that unless trade unions bar politics altogether, they will not be able to give adequate assurance that their administration of the unemployment scheme will be equitable and free from political(C 1992) 2 D 3
prejudice. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; asserts that if this amendment is not deleted on the report stage, the whole Labour movement will resist any attempt to put the Bill into force, and this paper goes so far as to threaten that this resistance will take an industrial as well as a political form. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; makes this an opportunity, as usual, of prejudicing the Bill in the eyes of its readers. &quot; It is plain that the whole measure is greatly disliked by a large proportion of trade unions, and is only accepted, without enthusiasm, by the workers in those industries which hope to be able to contract out of it.&quot; &quot; The Government would be well advised to withdraw it and introduce a new Bill based upon the principle of &apos; industrial maintenance&apos; and the exclusive administration of benefit by the trade unions.&quot;The &quot; Railway Review &quot; deals in a leading article with the new railway statistics which are being compiled by the Ministry of Transport. The new statistics are praised, and the &quot; Railway Review &quot; has no doubt, that their value justifies the work involved. It is believe that upon them may be based an effective check on the operations of railway companies which will tend to eliminate waste, &quot; which should be as beneficial to the railway workers as to the country.&quot;Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; complains that the new Profiteering Bill introduced by the President of the Board of Trade confers no power upon the profiteering committees to reach the principal profiteers. Mr. Snowden believes that profiteering measures will fail so long as the onus of complaint is put upon private individuals.&apos; Foreign Affairs.The conclusion of the San Remo conference receives attention in many papers. Two opinions may be quoted from the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The New Statesman &quot; thinks that a dangerous breach in Franco-British relations has been healed and that the Prime Minister returns from San Remo with the credit of the best piece of work which he has accomplished since the armistice. In a leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; expresses the opinion that the measure of agreement reached by the Supreme Allied Council at San Remo cannot be of more than a temporary character. The decisions of the conference with regard to Germany are approved, but the credit for them is given to the Italian Prime Minister. This paper looks forward to the entry of Russia and Germany into the League of Nations, when it is confident that all the territorial arrangements of the Treaties of Peace will have to be reconsidered.Mr. Philip Snowden refers in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; to the Anglo-Danubian Society. He warns his readers that a watch must be kept to see that this syndicate does not get permanent control of the commerce and industries of the countries concerned, in other words, that the condition of the Austro-Hungarian States is not exploited for the profit of foreign capitalists. The Labour Party deputation to Russia receives considerable notice in the I.L.P. papers and the &quot; New Statesman.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is profoundly sceptical of the value of this mission. &quot; Not one member of the delegation has yet taken a strong stand on behalf of Soviet Russia.&quot;Part IV. General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The most important feature of the situation continues to be negotiation with regard to wages. The claims of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen for wage advances, were considered by the Central Wages Board on the 4th May, and as it proved impossible to reach an agreement it was decided to refer the application to the National Wages Board. Conferences of the employers and the trade unions in the Cotton Industry have taken place and some progress has been made towards a settlement.Unrest caused by the continued increase in food prices is again on the increase and it may be expected that when the cost of living index number for May is published, it may be used as a ground for demanding further wage increases in certain industries. An important feature of the situation is the holding of a full conference of the executives of the constituent bodies of the Triple Alliance on the 6th May. The subjects to be discussed at this meeting are the proposals put forward by the N.U.R. with
reference to the extension of the Alliance and the question of high prices. The sub-com-mittee of the Alliance met on the 5th inst.,in preparation for the full meeting on the 6th. Full reference to the full conference will be made in this report next week.The Unemployment Position.The increase in the number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged for the week ended the 23rd April, 1920, was 763, compared with an increase of 6,315 between the 9th April and the 16th April. The number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 23rd April, 1920, was 221,181, composed of 219,018 by men and 2,163 by women.69,453 unemployment books remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 23rd April, 1920, making a reduction of 2,669 since the 16th April. At the latter date there were 47,868 books lodged by males and 24,254 by females (a total of 72,122) and at the 23rd April the number of books lodged by males was 45,549 and by females 23,904.At the 16th April, 141 ^policies remained lodged by short time workers, of which 95 were in the insured industries (74*7 per cent being in the engineering and ironfounding group) and 46 in the uninsured. At the week ended the 9th April there were 103 short time policies remaining lodged, and 337 at the 19th March.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges for the week ended the 23rd April, 1920, was 282,369 men, 49,158 women, 26,291 juveniles, compared with 286,342 men, 48,461 women, 26,479 juveniles a week ago (April 16th) and 301,897 men, 50,208 women, 20,142 juveniles at the 26th March, 1920.Conditions of Employment.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs introduced into the House of Commons on the 4th inst. a &quot;Factory and Workshops (Bakehouses) Bill&quot; and an &quot; Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Bill.&quot; The object of the first Bill is to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee appointed last year by the Minister of Labour to enquire into the practice of night work in the bread baking and flour confectionery trade. The purpose of the second Bill is to put into operation in the United Kingdom the three conventions adopted by the Washington International Labour Conference, which prohibit the employment of children under 14 years of age, and night work by all women and by youths under the age of 18. Of the exceptions to these provisions, the most important is with regard to night work by youths over 16 on continuous processes.Building Guild Movement.The methods of the Building Guild were discussed at a meeting of the London District Council of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives on the 28th April. The Council approved of the main principles of the Building Guild Scheme as elaborated by the Manchester Guild and a draft prospectus for the establishment of a London Building Guild is to be sent to the branches of the Federation for their approval. The men in the branches are to be asked to register themselves, and the Council will then be in a position to know exactly how much labour they can command if they decide to inaugurate a Guild Scheme.General Staff for Labour.The Committee which is at present engaged in formulating a scheme for a General Staff for Labour met on the 29th April to discuss details of organisation, including the method of electing the members of the proposed General Council. It was decided to have a joint consultation with the Labour Party and the Co-operative Movement for the purpose of co-ordinating statistical, legal and publicity work on a large scale. Details of the scheme will be submitted to the forthcoming annual conference of the Trades Union Congress.Scottish Trades Union Congress.The annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress opened at Dunfermline on the 28th April. The number of delegates in attendance was 240, representing 550,000 members. Mr. William Shaw, Secretary of the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council, in his speech demanded a revision of the Peace Treaty, the raising of all forms&apos;of blockade, and co-operation with the peoples of Central Europe to restore trade and commercial intercourse. Dealing with trade union organisation, he pointed out that efforts had been made to extend amalgamations of unions. The Congress in the course of its proceedings approved a Seamen&apos;s Charter demanding amongst other reforms an enquiry into the profits
of shipowners and the practicability of nationalisation of shipping. In the course of the proceedings an appeal was made for trade union devolution to give more opportunity for the initiative of the workshop.London Chamber of Commerce.The annual meeting of this body was held on the 28th April in London. Mr. Stanley Machin presided. He drew attention to the increased cost of living with the ever-increasing demand upon the public purse, and maintained that before any reduction in the cost of living could be secured, either the world must arrange to produce more or to consume less.Trade Union Friction.Friction has arisen between the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, &amp;c, and the Mill Engineers&apos; Association. The National Amalgamated Union of Engine-men, Firemen, &amp;c, has grown in members greatly during recent years, and in 1919 increased its membership from about 30,000 to 40,000. During this year the union ab-sorbed two local Enginemens Associations at Keighley and Halifax (Yorkshire), and its increase in membership in the Lancashire cotton textile industry has also been notable. But, more particularly in the spinning section of this industry, local societies of engine-drivers persist, and it is reported in particular that the Mill Engineers&apos; Association, which operates in the Oldham district, has decided to open its ranks to firemen and other workers, and is preparing to fight the National Amalgamated Union. There is also stated to be a difference in policy between the two unions. The smaller local engineers&apos; societies prefer to retain an upstanding wage without overtime payment, but with pay-ment for periods of sickness and standing-oif, while the National Amalgamated Union is negotiating for the payment of overtime rates after 48 hours&apos; work. It is reported that the National Amalgamated Union is contemplating a withdrawal of labour in those parts of the cotton textile industry where its position is strong, in order to secure that all engineers and firemen should join its membership.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Engineering Union. A conference of the executives of the unions which are about to form the Amalgamated Engineering Union opened at York on the 27th April and is dealing with the question of rules and constitution.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. At its annual conference in June this Federation will consider a series of resolutions proposing to increase the minimum con-tributions of affiliated unions to Is. per week, Qd. per week to be transferred to the Federation. It is suggested that the Federation should undertake the complete organisation of transport workers and the carrying out of negotiations of a national or international character.National Union of Railwaymen. A conference of all National Eailway Grade Com-mittees was held at Birmingham on the 30th April to arrange details of joint action to be taken throughout the whole of the branches of the National Union of railwaymen, to secure national conferences for each grade and the establishment of permanent National Grade Committees as official union machinery.National Clerical Union. A meeting to promote the formation of a union of clergymen under this title was held at the Church House, Westminster, on the 29th April. It was agreed to urge the removal of the municipal and parliamentary disability of the clergy and to apply for minimum rates of  400 per annum for married clergy and of  300 per annum for single.National Union of Journalists. A ballot is being taken on the question whether this organisation should apply for affiliation to the Trades Union Congress.Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors.This is an important new organisation which has secured the affiliation of practically every large department store in London. The objects of the association are to provide a central organisation for promoting and protecting those interests and to collect and disseminate information of general interest to retail businesses among their members.Ex-8ervice Men in Bristol,Disturbances on a considerable scale took place during last week in Bristol in connection with the demand of unemployed ex-Service men for the dismissal by the
Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company of women in their employment. For two days the tramway system was considerably interrupted owing to the action of the ex-Service men and the crowds. The Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company sub-sequently announced that the services of the girl conductors would be dispensed with at a week&apos;s notice and with a gratuity of  5. Work will thus be found for ex-Service men. The Lord Mayor of Bristol held a special conference to discuss the un-employment of Bristol ex-Service men, and a resolution was passed that it was desirable *that money now being spent on out-of-work donation should be used for public utility work, and that the Government should be requested to make this change in its policy at the earliest possible moment. Ex-Service men also sent deputations to various firms in the town to demand the replacement of female labour by ex-Service men. In con-nection with these occurrences, the Minister received a deputation on Monday, 3rd inst., representative of the Bristol Corporation, the Bristol Local Employment Committee and other bodies interested. The Minister has arranged for appropriate administrative action to be taken by the departments of the Ministry concerned.Trade Unions and ex-Service Men.Considerable correspondence has resulted from the letter of Lord Methuen to &quot; The Times,&quot; in which he made specific charges against the trade unions of obstructing the employment of ex-Service men. Mr. F. Bramley, assistant secretary of the Trades Union Congress, and Mr. S. Bradley, London District Secretary of the A.S.E., have repudiated these charges, and Mr. Tom Mann, General Secretary of the A.S.E., speaking at Leigh on the 26th April, stoutly defended the policy of the A.S.E. and attacked the treatment which the Government had given to the A.S.E. during the war.Labours International Relations.The Labour Deputation to Russia. The deputation mentioned in last week&apos;s Report as being on the point of setting out to Russia left London on the 27th April via Stockholm, with the addition of Mr. H. Skinner. The British Socialist Party states that an application has been made by its executive for passports for two members of the Party to go to Russia.Labour Women and Race Prejudice. A meeting was held at the Central Hall, West-minster, on the 27th April, to protest against the use of black troops in Europe. The meeting was held under the auspices of the Women&apos;s International League, the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild, the National Federation of Women Workers, the Federation of Women Teachers, the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries, and the Fabian Women&apos;s group. A resolution was passed calling upon the League of Nations to prohibit the importation into Europe for warlike purposes of troops belonging to primitive peoples, and their use anywhere except for the purpose of police and defence in the country of their origin.  A letter was read from M. Longuet supporting the protest.High Prices.The Council of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives has passed a resolution that &quot; in view of the increasing prices of commodities, which in their effects tend to extinguish any benefit intended by any increase of wages, this Council is of opinion that the time has arrived for some definite action to be iaken to deal with the question of high prices. This can only be effected through national and international agencies, and the executive of the Building Trades Federation is therefore asked to approach the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress in conjunction with the Labour Party to call a special congress to deal with the question.&quot; A large deputation of miners&apos; wives attended a meeting of the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation on the 26th April to urge that action should be taken to reduce the cost of living. Members of the deputation stated that recent wage advances were inadequate to meet the increase in the family budget.May Day Celebrations.A very large number of May Day celebrations took place throughout England, and in all cases resolutions were passed. The resolution at Hyde Park demanded immediate effective attention to the following means of dealing with some of the most pressing social problems : adequate housing and transport, amnesty to political and military prisoners, employment of all able-bodied adults on work useful to the community, the endowment
of motherhood, equal pay for men and women, full maintenance for workers disabled in the war and their dependents, full compensation for all workers injured in industry, and support for widows and orphans and the infirm, the abolition of the Aliens&apos; Restriction Act and the abolition of the present charitable system and the adoption of State support and control for the blind. Various political resolutions were also passed, and a demand was made for a drastic handling of high prices and full recognition of the Industrial Co-operative Movement. Mr. J. H. Thomas, Mr. C. T. Cramp, Mr. F. Hodges, Mr. J. Sexton and other important Labour leaders addressed meetings in the provinces. There was in no case any suggestion that the day should be celebrated by a strike, and there does not appear to have been any general stoppage of work except among miners. In a large number of cases workpeople abstained from work individually. In some cases it was arranged between employers and workpeople that the day should be regarded as a holiday and co-operative societies in London appear to have given their employees a holiday.Strikers and Productive Co-operation.It may be interesting to note that three separate instances have lately come to hand of strikes in which the strikers are reported to be attempting to supply their labour to the public direct. At Edinburgh and Leith 700 operative plumbers have been on strike since the 3rd inst. to enforce retrospective payment under the Government scheme for demobilised apprentices. The Strike Committee announced that they were proposing to open shops for the purpose of supplying direct labour to the public. At Southport, where a strike of laundry workers over a case of alleged victimisation and increased wages demands has continued since the 12th ult., the strikers are reported to be making the necessary arrangements for starting a laundry on their own. Journeymen tailors and tailoresses at Tmibridge Wells, whose strike notices took effect on the 19th inst., owing to the employers&apos; refusal to concede their claims for increased rates, are reported to have opened a co-operative workshop to prove by the low prices they charge that their employers can meet their demands.T.
