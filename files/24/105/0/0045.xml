[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.C.P.-1245.3 u cabinet.IMPERIAL EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering Memoranda by Mr. B. P. Blackett and Mr. R. G. Hawtrey.(Previous Papers, C.P.-846 and C.P.-1117.)I CIRCULATE memoranda on this subject by Mr. Blackett and Mr. Hawtrey, with which I am in general agreement.(Initialled) A. C.Treasury, S.W., May 10, 1920.I.Proposals for a Uniform Imperial Currency.Memorandum by Mr. B. P. Blackett.Three separate questions arise from the memorandum circulated in regard to a uniform Imperial currency, viz. : 1. Is it desirable to assimilate or unify the three separate currency standards which (with the exception of the Far Eastern colonies) cover the wholeBritish Empire, viz., sterling, dollars and rupees ? 2. Is an automatic standard such as the pre-war gold standard desirable forImperial currency?  or is it desirable to substitute a State-regulated - currency dependent upon State or Imperial credit, such as Mr. Darlingsuggests in his plan for an Empire bank ? 3. Is an early restoration of sterling to par with gold desirable, and, generally,what are the effects of a discount on sterling ?I append memoranda by Mr. Hawtrey, which, though not written directly as answers to (2) and (3), cover much the same ground, and as regards these two questions I need only add a few remarks.   The policy laid down by the Cunliffe Committee, and steadily pursued by the Treasury during the last year, has been aimed at getting away as soon as possible from a State-regulated currency back to the gold standard.   The tendency, if not the avowed purpose, of. the memoranda under consideration is a reversal of this policy on grounds of protection of British Empire trade.   Now, so long as discount on sterling in terms of gold or on other currencies in terms of gold is recognised as a temporary phenomenon, and especially when effects are clearly being made to shorten the period during which such discount will persist, the discount does act as a strong stimulus on exports and a protection for home industries.   This is mainly because conventional prices are apt to lag behind in a world movement.   But if a currency is allowed to settle down or is pegged at a given discount in terms of gold, internal prices and costs of production tend very soon to establish themselves according to the new quasi-permanent level of the currency, and the protective element in the discount disappears.   This is the short answer-to the contention that &quot; a low exchange between the British Empire and the outside world would act as a tremendously strong stimulus to mter-Imperial trade and constitute a most effective and politically non-contentious form of Imperial preference.&quot;[3194] B
It remains to consider the first question, the desirability of assimilating the currencies of the British Empire. Before the war the gold sovereign was current as a medium of circulation and as a uniform currency standard throughout the British Empire. But in accordance with the recognised currency maxim that a community should have and will usually succeed in securing, even in spite of legislation to the contrary, the sort of currency which, suits it, some parts of the British Empire used a currency not directly based on the   sterling. Canada, as was natural with a British speaking community of over 100,000,000 souls bordering upon its territory for a distance of 3,000 to 4,000 miles, deliberately chose many years ago to adopt the dollar as the most convenient currency for its use. India&apos;s chief medium of exchange was and had long been the silver rupee., South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and (to a large extent) the West Indies, used sterling. West Africa used sterling. East Africa used the rupee which, in view of its trade relations with India, had much convenience, though it has since decided that sterling offers on the whole a balance of advantages.Nearly all the changes referred to in the memorandum in British Empire Currency during the war are purely temporary results of the temporary loss of an effective gold basis for sterling.The one important change, and the one to which most objection is taken, viz., the fixing of the rupee at 2s. gold, so far from being a move away from a uniform Imperial Currency is a move in the direction of a uniform Imperial Currency.When the gold basis of sterling is restored -which may come about much sooner than seems to be expected by the writers of the memorandum, the rupee in India at 2s. will be much more closely assimilated to the  , of which it will be exactly one-tenth part, than it was at Is. id.The one currency system of the Empire which will still be &quot; divorced from sterling&quot; for practical purposes will be the Canadian dollar. It Avould be possible, of course, to discuss at length the advantages and disadvantages of divorcing the Canadian dollar from that of the United States of America and assimilating it to sterling, e.g., by fixing it at 4s. ^ $5 to the  . But I venture to think that for Canadian purposes divorce from the United States dollar would be hopelessly inconvenient, and that the suggestion would not be seriously considered by practical people in Canada. Inci-dentally it may be remarked that such a change involves most difficult questions in the relations between debtor and creditor. The Canadian Government is on balance a creditor of the British Government for war advances, and while the fixing of the dollar at 4s. would not involve reduction in the amount of dollars owed by British Government to the Canadian Government, it would benefit the British Government by reducing the amount of sterling needed to produce the dollars. On the other hand, the Canadian people owe large amounts in sterling and in American dollars, and would not welcome a plan which permanently increased the amount of Canadian currency which they had to pay to meet their sterling and United States dollar debts.(Initialled)        B.P.B.Treasury, S.W., May 6, 1920.II.Imperial Exchange and Currency. Memorandum by Mr. B. G. Hawtrey.The various proposals for instituting a uniform currency unit for the Empire raise some very fundamental questions in regardto the exchanges, and it may be useful to enunciate one or two general principles.The exchange between two countries measures the relative purchasing power of their currency units. If  1 is worth $4 that means, subject to certain qualifications, that  1 will buy four times as much in the world&apos;s markets as $1. If, without any increase in the supply of commodities, the supply of currency in a country is increased, the value or purchasing power of the currency unit in terms of commodities falls; in other words, prices rise. This tendency, if given free play, will be reflected in the foreign exchanges. If the average price of commodities in terms of sterling rises by 20 per cent., then the sterling price of dollars, which are merely the means of buying American commodities, will rise by 20 per cent, (subject to many complicated adjustments, into which it is not neceBsary to enter). If, when such an increase in purchasing power and in prices occurs the exchanges are not proportionately adjusted, that means that foreign
o 0commodities are cheaper than domestic commodities, and there ensues an excess of imports over exports. If this excess is paid for either by shipments of gold or by borrowing from abroad, it can continue, and the exchange can be kept up just so long as the shipments and the borrowing last. As soon as the excess of imports is no longer paid for, the exchange becomes adverse.To put this principle briefly, an unfavourable exchange is a defence against an excess of imports, which would otherwise be attracted by a nominal increase in the quantity of purchasing power in circulation.One of the most important consequences of the proposal for a uniform Imperial currency would be the restoration of the Canadian Exchange to par. Sir L. Worthington Evans and Mr. Amery, in their memorandum of the 31st March,* say that &quot; the rise of the Canadian Exchange against us lias, of contribute.se, also contributed to the high cost of living in this country.&quot; This is to reverse cause and effect. It is the inflation of credit here, with the consequent rise of prices, which has made the Canadian Exchange, like that in the United States, adverse. Again it is claimed that the effect of the fall of the Canadian Exchange 15 per cent, below the American &quot; has undoubtedly been to stimulate both canada home production and export trade, and to furnish a very appreciable additional preference to British imports into Canada.&quot; On the contrary, the fall of the Canadian Exchange is really a sign that the purchasing power of Canadian dollars has declined; temporarily it stimulates exports, but only so far as is necessary to counteract the stimulation of imports which would otherwise be occasioned by the rise in the Canadian price level. &quot;The advantages of this state of affairs,&quot; which are stated to he &quot; increasingly realised by Canadian business men,&quot; are nothing more nor less than the advantages of an inflated currency, which gives business men excessive profits from the export trade, as well as from the home trade, so long as prices are rising.The position in South Africa is different. ,There the inflation has already occurred, and there, as here, convertibility of paper money into sovereigns lias been maintained nominally in force only by means of prohibitions on melting and export,&apos; prohibitions which it is very difficult to enforce in face of the large profits to be made by contravening them. The reform advocated by Mr. Strakosch is in essence merely a suspension of specie payments, accompanied by a gradual deflation of credit so as to bring the value of South African currency nearer to the gold par. In South Africa sterling has recently, as the result of this policy, fallen to a discount of 6 per cent. If that discount is to be corrected, credit in the Union would have to be to that extent again inflated, and the policy deliberately adopted reversed.In the memorandum it is stated that &quot; our low exchange in the United Kingdom is, at this moment, acting as a most effective protection to our home industries and as a stimulus to our export trade and is enabling us to undersell the United States in every market.&quot; Precisely the same criticism applies to this statement as to those made in regard to Canada. The low exchange does no more than counteract the disadvantages from which we should otherwise suffer owing to inflation here. According to the &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; for April the average wages in the United States for the year 1919 were 55 per cent, higher than in 1913. In this country wages were over 100 per cent, higher. Prices had risen in February 1920 as compared with 1913, according to the figures used by the Supreme Council, by 120 per cent, in America and by 170 per cent, here.   The American exchange is at a discount of about 21 per cent.If the exchange does anything more than counteract a tendency to an excess of imports, if, that is, it produces an actual excess of exports (after allowing for freights, interest, and other &quot;invisible exports&quot;), then that can only mean that we are lending abroad. This is merely another way of saying that to grant credits to foreign countries gives rise to an adverse movement of the exchange. (The gratinng of credits is the cause, because without it the adverse exchange could not continue. The granting of credits may take the form of merely leaving balances of foreign currency abroad in preference to remitting them home).It may be admitted that it is not desirable &quot; to restore our exchanges with America and the metallic standard world too rapidly.&quot; Recovery in the exchange, unless it is a mere window-dressing manipulation, must involve some fall in the prices of commodities. A fall of prices, if it takes place too suddenly, causes great commercial distress. It depreciates the value of stocks of commodities, discourages the purchase of fresh stocks, and so restricts the activity of trade and industry. At the present time that activity is so abnormal that there is room for a good deal of restriction before* 0.P.-1117.
any visible effect would be produced. But undoubtedly if symptoms either of unemployment or of a commercial crisis developed, it would be undesirable to push deflationery measures so far as to hamper the steady flow of production.This illustrates the difficulties which have been created for us not only by inflation during the war, but by the orgy of trade borrowing that has raised prices by 40 per cent, in the past twelve months. To ask the Dominions to come on to a sterling basis is to ask them to place the same difficulties on their own shoulders.(Initialled)        R. G. H.Treasury, 8.W., May 3, 1920.III.Mr. Darlings Proposal for an Empire Bank.* Memorandum by Mr. B. G. Eawtrey.The.two principal requisites of a sound currency system are : (1) Stability in the purchasing power of the currency unit in  terms of commodities;(2) Stability in the value of the currency unit in terms of foreign currency units.Before the war these conditions were fulfilled substantially, though not exactly, by the gold standard. Now that the purchasing power of foreign currencies has become fluctuating tne two conditions are no longer compatible with one another. The purpose of Mr. Darlings proposal is to attain the second condition, so far as the constituent portions of the British Empire are concerned, and the means advocated is a development of the Exchange standard. That is to say, the banking system through-out the Empire would maintain, instead of gold reserves, credits with a Bank of the Empire, and inter-Empire payments, when not settled by the Exchange market, would be made by drafts on these credits. For example, if a balance became due from Australia to South Africa, it would not be necessary to ship gold ; payment would be made by a telegraphic transfer on London, debiting the Australian Bank and crediting the South African.The great advantage of the system is that, whether the currency is on a gold basis or not, uniformity of currency units is secured without the use of any actual gold. -Thus, under present conditions, it is possible in the first place to attain uniformity before the gold standard is restored, and in the second place, by economising gold, to avoid creating a new demand for gold which might retard indefinitely the restoration of the standard.Mr. Darling&apos;s proposal is &quot;open to the objection that his Empire Bank can do no more than preserve an already existing uniformity of currency units. If it is to come into operation, either the relative values of the Empire Currency units must be stereotyped at their existing exchange rates, or each Dominion must adjust the purchasing power of its unit till the nominal par is reached. These adjustments would take the form either of a contraction of credit, where the exchange on London is unfavourable, or of a relaxation of credit, where it is favourable. I do not think the former condition applies at the present time to any portion of the Empire. Consequently the first step, in, e.g., Canada, South Africa and India, would have to be a relaxation of credit, that is to say a new measure of inflation, for the purpose of reducing the value of their currency units in terms of sterling to par.Thereafter, if, as we all hope, some measure of deflation is to be accomplished in this country, all the Dominions, including those which would have indulged in inflation expressly in order to get to par with sterling, must impose on themselves the necessary credit contraction.Mr. Darling seems to assume throughout that adverse exchanges are the result only of indebtedness, and can be cured only by increased production and exports. He leaves out of account, what is undoubtedly the fundamental factor, the purchasing power of the currency unit in terms of commodities. To diminish this purchasing power is fatally easy; to increase it is difficult and laborious.* See Aunexure (A) to C.P.-1117.
Mr. Darling starts by advocating his proposal as a remedial measure for the American exchange, but he nowhere produces any argument in support of its remedial effect. He expresses the hope that it will enable us to redeem our debt to America &quot; by the double process of increasing inter-Empire trade and thus buying less from foreign countries and increasing the Empire&apos;s exports to foreign countries and especially to the United States.&quot; But the only ground suggested for this is that if Canada came on to a sterling basis her exports to the United States would be stimulated, apparently because her exchange would then become as unfavourable as ours.If it be assumed that the preliminary obstacles have been surmounted, and that all the existing Imperial currencies are at par, it remains to be considered how the proposed Imperial currency will work.In the first place will stability in the purchasing power of the currency unit thus established for the whole Empire be adequately secured ? Mr. Darling relies on what is called the &quot; self-liquidating bill of exchange,&quot; to prevent inflationary movements. He argues (as Adam Smith argued, and as the Directors of the Bank of England argued in 1810) that, if the assets held against currency are composed of bills drawn to finance movements of commodities, which will be paid at maturity by the proceeds of actual sale, then the currency can never be redundant. The fallacy in this line of argument was exposed by the Bullion Committee, and by how many economists in the past 100 years! The fallacy does not lie&apos;in the fact that several bills may be simultaneously in existence which were originally drawn against the same consignment of commodities. Probably that objection could be overcome. The real flaw in the self-liquidating bill of exchange is that any tendency to inflation increases the prices of commodities, and increases therefore also the face value of the bills that may be drawn to finance a given consign-&apos; merit. Even, therefore, if initially the supply of bills did not exceed the aggregate amount of currency required, any excess of currency, though it may be in itself casual and momentary, tends to produce an excess of bills, which in turn makes the excess of currency greater. This inherent tendency of expanding credit to react upon itself is the greatest obstacle in the way of effective control. Up to now mankind has never devised any corrective for the consequent tendency towards inflation except a metallic monetary standard (though ingenious theorists have often devised plans for fixing the purchasing power of a unit of paper money by reference to an index number of prices). During the Napoleonic wars the Bank of England found that the sell-liquidating bill was no safeguard against either inflation or speculation. At the present time the same system has done absolutely nothing to assist the American Federal Reserve Board to control credit, even with an effective gold standard in operation. Mr. Darling&apos;s hope that a system of automatic control of currency can be built on this foundation is quite illusory.He proposes, it is true, to reinforce the self-liquidating bill by a plan for draining off redundant currency from the banks in subscriptions to long-dated 3 per cent. Empire Loan Certificates. It is difficult to. believe that he has thought out this suggestion. It may be conceded that when a supply of redundant currency is first floated, money is &quot;cheap,&quot; and banks, in looking for the means of employing it, might be ready to put it into a security with a low yield. This was the significance of the extraordinarily, cheap money which prevailed for some time in 1915. But this is not at all the ordinary working of inflationary tendencies in time of peace. Inflation then grows gradually, and among the most marked characteristics of its period of growth are (1) high rates on money and high discount rates, corresponding to the high profits made in trade, and (2) a great difficulty in getting subscriptions for gilt-edged issues, owing to the attractiveness of industrial and commercial ventures. At such a time the 3 per cent. Empire Loan Certificates would be at a heavy discount, and no bank would have any inducement to take them.It is futile to hope for any self-regulating currency. Nowadays control of currency is dependent upon control of credit, and Mr. Darling&apos;s plan should be looked at as one for reforming the control of credit throughout the Empire. He would substitute his Empire Bank for the Bank of England. The Empire Bank would differ from the Bank of England in two fundamental respects : (1). It would be a Government Department, and (2),it would be an organ of the whole Empire and not of England only.It is not necessary to dwell at length on the difficulty of devising a satisfactory constitution for the Bank. No precedent exists for an Executive Department &quot; in the control of which each part of the Empire would have a share.&quot; It is doubtful whether the important requirements of prompt decision in an emergency and independence of action could be reconciled with this condition. The proposal betrays a certain want of appreciation of the immeasurable advantages which our credit system reaps from the&apos; [3194] ^     , C
rexistence of the Bank of England. The constitution of the Bank is difficult to defend in theory; its infinite merit in practice is that it has evolved a tradition which is stronger than the personnel by which it is from time to time governed. Almost every-thing that is worth knowing about the regulation of credit has been discovered through the working of the Bank of England. The much vaunted Federal Reserve Act is really based in its essentials upon the Bank of Englands experience. It may be that this invaluable tradition could be preserved in spite of a radical change of regime. But clearly it ought not to be lightly tampered with.Apart from the proposal to convert the Bank of England into an Imperial Govern-ment Department, Mr. Darlings plan differs less than would at first appear from the existing conditions, or at any rate from the pre-war conditions. Before the war Australia did not in practice pay balances to South Africa by shipping gold. All the gold movements passed through London, and balances were settled, just as Mr. Darling proposes, by credit transactions in London. Each Dominion regulated its currency by reference to its relations with London. If it indulged in any undue expansion of credit, its sterling assets melted away, and it had to contract credit to restore its position. This is still so, except that sterling is depreciated and the uniformity of inter-Imperial exchange has thus for the time being been lost. The important question is whether sterling is to be levelled up or the Dominion currencies levelled down. If nothing but inter-Imperial relations entered into the problem there would be much to be said for levelling down and saving all the strain of deflation. But with America on a gold basis there can be no question but that we shall have to get back to our pre-war pound of 113 grains of fine gold, and, if so, we cannot ask the Dominions to drop further away from this standard to gain a temporary parity.Special stress is laid in Mr. Darling&apos;s memorandum on the case of India. The governing factors in India are (1) that the primary medium of exchange is and must remain the silver rupee; (2) that having regard to native opinion it has been decided that an alteration of the silver content of the rupee is most inadvisable; (3) that a recoinage would be so vast an undertaking as to be almost impracticable; (4) that the rupee cannot be permanently maintained in circulation at a value below that of its silver contents. For the present, at any rate, there is a high degree of probability that the gold value of silver will not rise far above the melting-point of the American silver dollar (10*95 rupees to a sovereign). There is no security that any given sterling value that may be prescribed will not be passed unless sterling itself is successfully restored to a gold basis.(Initialled) R G. H.Treasury, S.W., April 28, 1920.
