This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.OPOSED REORGANIZATION OF THE FRENCH ARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a summary of the proposals contained in a Private Draft Bill on the reorganization of the French Army which has been presented by a Committee of soldiers and civilians for consideration by the Army Commission of the French Senate. Though, of course, the French Government may not accept the whole of the recommendations of the Committee, it is probable that the reorganization of the French Army will proceed along the lines of the proposals in the Draft Bill. It is not yet known what proportion of black and coloured troops is contemplated in the proposed organizations, but it is hoped that information on this point will shortly be available.w. s. c.The War Office,&apos;-T*May, 1920.1. General Principles. The proposals are based on the following considerations : ,(a.) The League of Nations is a hope of the future, but is of no present value. (6.) The world is unsettled, and the possibility of wars will continue, at all eventsfor a number of years, (c.) Although the Hohenzollern Dynasty has disappeared, the Prussian lust fordomination still exists and remains a danger to the peace of the world. (d.) France must be strong enough not to be obliged to live under the perpetualthreat of war, and to guarantee the peace of Europe, (e.) The main burden of ensuring the execution of the Peace Treaty and ofguarding the Rhine devolves upon France. (/) For these reasons France must remain strong, but her strength need not be so great as in pre-war days.   Economic considerations render it imperative forher to cut down her military forces to a minimum.2. Pre-War Figures.An interesting resume is given of the peace effectives and the strength on mobilization of the French Army in 1914 (when universal service for 3 years existed), showing the following figures : (a.) Peace effectives.Men.Three annual contingents, average 195,000 men        ...      ...      ...     585,000Permanent cadres, including non-commissioned officers, re-engaged soldiers in the home and colonial forces, native troops and Foreign Legion...............   ,  ...      ...      ......&apos;  165,000Total............     750,000In addition there were 29,000 officers and 50,000 auxiliary troops.These troops were in peace time grouped in 21 Territorial Army Corps (of which the xixth was in Algeria and Tunisia), and the Colonial Army Corps, i.e., \12 Army Corps in all. Each Army Corps had 2 divisions, except the Vlth and xixth, which had 3 each, so that there were 46 active divisions in all.Each division had 2 infantry brigades (brigade = 2 regiments = 6 battalions = 24 companies and 6 machine-gun sections), 1 or 2 squadrons of cavalry, a field artillery regiment of 9 batteries and 36 guns, a company of engineers, supply and medical services.(1120/216)   100  5/20  II&amp;S  8208wo
Total, 47 divisions       ............ 1,032,000Reserve Army Reserve formations, 25 divisions    ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 450,000Independent cavalry, 10 divisions   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 52,500Army Troops, including heavy artillery, staff, &amp;c....      ...       ... 187,500Total, 72 infantry and 10 cavalry divisions   ...   1,722,000Territorial Army 12 infantry divisions......................&quot;11 infantry brigade    .....................j   185*000Garrisons of fortresses, &amp;c. ... Lines of Communication troops on mobilization, the numbers available in the active, reserve and Territorial armies amounted, roughly to five million men, with 845,000 horses. There were 4,708 field guns, with 1,390 rounds per gun, 96 mountain guns and 724 heavy guns. In addition there were over 4,000 heavy guns and over 5,000 guns of medium calibre in fortified places or in reserve in the arsenals.3. Present Requirements.The British and Americans will only furnish I brigade each on the Rhine, and the Belgians 1 division, i.e., 2 divisions in all.It will be necessary for the French to maintain an army of G infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division on the Rhine, i.e., over 100,000 men.Considerable forces must also be kept in North Africa, where vast regions remain in an unsettled condition, and in Asia Minor. A striking force is also required for police purposes, to keep the peace on land, as France&apos;s Allies may be expected to do at sea.For these reasons France will require an army with a peace strength of about 350,000 men, which would be composed of one annual contingent of 200,000 men, with 150,000 permanent troops. This whTinvolve compulsory service for a period of 1 year, instead of the pre-war term of 3 years.The following is the proposed composition of the French Army in peace time : Men.Annual contingent, recruited by compulsory service      ... 200.000Non-commissioned officers   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 30,000Permanent cadres Non-commissioned officers and men of Colonial troopsin France     ...      ...       ...      ...      ...      ... 20,000Re-engaged French soldiers   ...      ...      ...      ... 50,000Foreign Legion and Native troops    ...      ...      ... 50,000Total    .....    -.........    350,0004.   Proposed Organization of the French Army.(a.) The basis of the new army to be compulsory service equal for all men, but with the term of service with the Colours reduced from 3 years to 1 year. Terms of service to be as follows : Service with the Colours     ...... ...... 1 year.Service with the Active Army Reserve ...... 9 years.Service with the Territorial Army  ... ...      ... 10Service with the Territorial Reserve ...      ... 5    .,Total25 years from the age -  of 20 to 45.(b.) Strength on Mobilization.Active Armv Men.20 Army Corps at 2 divisions at 45,000 men        ......... 900 0001 Army Corps at 3 divisions................ 6o&apos;oOO4 divisions, of which 1 Alpine and 3 from North Africa ...      ... 72&apos;oOO
These periods of service may be reduced when the terms of the Peace Treaty with Germany have been executed.In order to ensure, at all times, the presence of an adequate number of trained men with the Colours, it is proposed to call up the annual class as follows : One-third on 1st February. One-third on 1st August. One-third on 1st November.Measures must be taken to prepare youths for their military service by compulsory physical training and military education in all schools.(6.) The general principle of the new scheme is to have 23 Army Corps (an increase of 1), with 1 division only in time of peace, and 2 divisions each in time of war. Certain exceptions are necessitated by the requirements of the Army of the Rhine and North Africa. To meet these requirements, it is proposed to form a new Army Corps (XXIInd) in Morocco, and to give the 2 North African Army Corps (xixth and XXIInd) 3 divisions each in time of peace, and 2 divisions each to the 3 Army Corps on the eastern frontier of France, and to the Colonial corps.The peace strength of the French Army would thus be : 17 Army Corps in the interior of France at 1 division3  Army  Corps on the eastern frontier of France, at 2 divisions ...1 Colonial corps in France2 Army Corps in North Africa, at 3 divisions17 divisions.6      ,,26Total...31Of these 31 divisions, 6 would belong to the Army of the Rhine, viz. :-From the 3 Army Corps on the eastern frontier From the 2 North African Army Corps From the Colonial Army Corps in France3 divisions....     1Total.Plus 1 cavalry division.(c.) The cavalry should be reduced from 10 to 4 independent cavalry divisions, of which 1 to be with the Army of the Rhine.On mobilization, the 23 Army Corps or 46 divisions, of which the Active Army would be composed, would be grouped in 5 or 6 armies. It is proposed to establish the headquarters of the inspectors of these armies in close proximity to their troops in order to enable the inspectors and their staff to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the formations which would come under their orders in time of war.5. Details of Organization.(a.) Strength of an infantry company to be reduced from 250 to 200 men. An infantry battalion to be composed of 3 infantry companies and 1 machine gun company, plus some artillery (artillerie d&apos;accompagnement), probably on armoured cars, total strength about 750 men.An infantry regiment to consist of 3 battalions, i.e., approximately 2,500 men.A cavalry regiment to have 4 squadrons, as in pre-war days.(b.) An infantry division to have 1 infantry brigade of 3 regiments or 9 battalions, instead of 2 infantry brigades, i.e, 4 regiments or 12 battalions.Each division to have 1 regiment (9 batteries) of field and 1 of heavy artillery. Each regiment to have sufficient cadres to form another regiment on mobilization for the reserve division.The division should also have its cavalry squadron, company of engineers, company of tanks, aeroplane squadrons (for fighting, artillery work and near reconnaisance), plus supply and medical services.(8203)\

Its war composition would be Men.3  infantry  regiments,  each  of  3  battalions, each of     7,5003 companies, and 1 machine gun company. 2 regiments of artillery, with ammunition columns       ...     3,500 1 cavalry squadron ... &apos;    ...      ...      ...       ...        1751 engineer company ...      ...      ...      ...      ...11 tank company       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       ... ?   1,000Aeroplane squadrons ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...JStaff, supply and medical services, Lines of Communication     4,000troops. - Approximate strength   ...      ...    16,000In peace, a division in France would have 7,000 men, and those in North Africa, the east frontier of France and in the Colonial corps, 10,000 men.(c.) An independent cavalry division, in war would consist of Men.6 regiments, each of 4 squadrons, at 175 men      ...      ...     4,2001 group of 3 field artillery batteries..,1 machine-gun section        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... f     8001 armoured car machine-gun detachment ...      ...      ... JTotal.........     5,000The peace strength of a cavalry division would be 3,000 men, and that of the cavalry division on the Rhine, 4,000.(d.) An Army Corps would, on mobilization, have 2 infantry divisions, with corps troops, consisting of headquarter staff, artillery and engineer staff, 2 regiments of artillery, field and heavy, artillery and engineer parks, supply and medical services, &amp;c.Its composition would be Men.2 infantry divisions, at 16,000 men       ......      ...      ...    32,000Army corps troops, approximately        ......      ...      ...     8,000Total.........    40,000Peace strengths would be as follows :-(1.)

Army troops would, on mobilization, be of considerable strength and importance, and would include regiments of heavy artillery, engineers, army air . formations, parks, supply and medical services, &amp;c.   In peace time they should be kept as low as possible.
