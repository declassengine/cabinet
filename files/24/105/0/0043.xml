THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAffllO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)5 O g E T.WHEAT POSITION AMD THE BREAD SUBSIDY, (Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer),I had hoped that the improvement in the New York exchange would result in a saving on the Bread Subsidy estimated to cost  45,000,000 in the present financial year, but a report just laicl before me shows that the improvement in the exchange is more than swallowed up by the rise in Wheat prices.The report is based on information as to stocks and oourse of prices supplied by the Commission and     a rate of exchange estimated by the Treasury.   It is assumed that N9W York exchange will average.3.80 dollars and that the Argentine B^dMuip will correspond with this figure.   On this, basis and on the assumptions as to supply and prices made by the Commission the subsidy required to maintain the present price of aread will be not  45,000,000 but  60,000,000,   There is some reason to hope that the average rate of exohange *vill be rather better than 3*80,   If It were as high as 4 dollara there would be a saving of  5,000,000 providod that tho price rose no further.   Even so the subsidy would cost &apos;  10,000,000 more than was anticipated and it is, I fear, probable that any rise in exchange will be followed by a rise in tho dollar price of wheat, for it would seem that the world price of wheat is a sterling price and that the dollar price is merely a conversion    of that sterling price into dollars at the exchange of the day.Under the circumstances it seems to me necessary that the Cabinet should at onoe sanction an increase of 4d. in the price of the loaf to take effect as early as possible. Whether this should be coupled with an increased extraction of flour is a matter for consideration on which at present -I offer no opinion.   In any case I think that the reasons for the action of the Government and the world shortage of supplies should be at once made public and that everyone should again be urged to economise to the utmost of his power in the use of flour.(Initialled). A.C.Treasury, S.W. 7th May. 1930.
