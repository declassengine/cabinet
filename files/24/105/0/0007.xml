Its finance the finance of the Commission is Imperial. All parts of the Empire have generously and unreservedly promised to bear their share of the expenses. The Imperial War Conference, having considered the proposals of the Commission, passed the following resolution on June 17, 1918 : &quot;The Conference desires to place on record its appreciation of the Labours of the Imperial War Graves Commission, and is in favour of the cost of carrying out the decisions of the Commission being borne by the respective Governments in proportion to the numbers of the graves of their dead.&quot;Its History.THE origin and development of the Imperial War Graves Commission is very simple. In the first days of the war the different armies engaged created organisations, under the direction of the War Office, to register, mark, and tend the graves of British soldiers, as well as to answer inquiries from relatives, and, where possible, to send them photographs of the graves. Later, a National Committee was constituted, which, on the suggestion of the Prince of Wales, who took a keen personal interest in the work, was expanded into an Imperial Commission, representing the Dominions, India, the Colonies, the fighting Services, Labour, the great public departments interested, and the British Red Cross, which latter had supplied, as it still does to a considerable extent, the funds for photographing and planting the graves.
A War Cemetery with Permanent Memorials as designed.
THE CEMETERIES.WITH the growth of the war the Commission^ work naturally covered every part of the world where the men of the Empire had served and died from the vast and known cities of our dead in Flanders and France to hidden and outlying burial-grounds of a few score at the ends of the earth. These resting-places are situated on every conceivable site on bare hills flayed by years of battle, in orchards and meadows, beside populous towns or little villages, in jungle-glades, at coast ports, in far-away islands, among desert sands, and desolate ravines. It would be as impossible as undesirable to reduce them all to any uniformity of aspect by planting or by architecture.In a war where the full strength ot nations was used without respect of persons, no difference could be made between the graves of officers or men. Yet some sort of central idea was needed that should symbolise our common sacrifice wherever our dead might be laid ; and it was realised, above all, that each cemetery and individual grave should be made as permanent as man&apos;s art could devise.
&quot;Their ^Design and CareP&apos; I  A HE Commission instructed Sir Frederic Kenyon, K.C.B., to report how  these aims  could  best I     be realised, and he, after consulting very fully with the relatives, representatives of the Services, religion   and   art,   and  knowing  the  practical limitations,   particularly in  obtaining labour,  for carrying out such a vast undertaking, recommended that in each cemetery there should stand a Cross of Sacrifice, and an altarlike Stone of Remembrance, and that the  headstones or the graves  should be of uniform shape and size.    Stone crosses to succeed the temporary wooden crosses were at first suggested, but crosses of the  small size necessitated by the nearness of the graves to each other do not allow sufficient space for the men&apos;s names and the inscriptions, and are also by their shape too fragile and too subject to the action of frost and weather for enduring use.    Plain headstones, measuring 2 ft. 6 in.  by i ft. 3 in., were  therefore chosen, upon which the Cross or other religious symbol of the dead man&apos;s faith could be carved and his Regimental badge fully displayed.   The Regiments have been consulted as to the designs of these badges, some of which have now been approved and are ready for engraving as soon as experiments which are being carried on. have shown how to overcome the difficulties of dealing with such  numbers.     In  due. time, then, wherever a man  may be buried, from East Africa to North Russia, his headstone will carry his Regimental badge, identifiable the world over.Besides the fighting forces, provision must be made for the graves of the merchant-seamen and discharged men whose deaths were due to enemy action, for Sisters and Nurses killed or died of wounds or disease, for Labour units of all races, and, indeed, for all who have served in any capacity in the war.    The distinctive badges of these headstones are not yet all decided upon.

Inscriptions^ 7^egisters9 and Planning.IN addition to the name and rank upon the headstone, the Commission  feel that relatives should, if they wish, add  a  short inscription of their own choice as  an expression of personal  feeling  and affection.   These inscriptions will be at the relatives&apos; expense, and, to avoid unduly crowding the stones with very small lettering, which, besides being difficult to read, does not weather well, it has been found necessary to restrict the length of the inscription to sixty-six letters.*Every cemetery will keep registers of the dead buried there, and in these registers it is hoped that it will be possible, with the assistance of his kin, to enter the age, parentage, and birthplace of each known man.The planning and planting of the cemeteries must depend largely on their site and the climate of the country, but it is proposed that, as a general rule, the cemeteries should have buildings designed for services, ceremonies, and shelter, where the register of that cemetery *swill be kept under permanent safeguard.    To recapitulate : i. For each Cemetery its Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance, the latter bearing the quotation [Ecclesiasticus 44, v. 14) &quot;THEIR  NAME LIVETH  FOR EVERMORE&quot;;2. For each grave its enduring headstone, carved with the symbol of the dead man&apos;s faith, his name and rank, his Regimental badge, and whatever text or inscription his relatives may add ;3. In the Cemetery building the register in which the man&apos;s birthplace, age, and parentage can be recorded and referred  to.* In counting the sixty-six letters, the space between any two words must be reckoned as one letter.&apos;I I
 Memorials to the  Missing.THIS matter is naturally of the deepest concern to the relatives of those whose bodies have never been recovered or identified, or whose graves, once made, have been destroyed by later battles. Their number is not small, and Sir Frederic Kenyon has suggested that the best way to record their memory would be to place a tablet on the walls or cloisters at the cemetery nearest to the spot where it is presumed they have lost their lives. In the case of officers and men in the Flying Corps, the place of whose death could not be known within many miles, the tablet might be placed in the cemetery nearest to the camp from which they had started on their last flight. But in any case relatives may be assured that the dead who have no known resting-place will be made equal with the others, and that each case will be dealt with upon full consideration of its merits as regards the site and the place of the memorial.Qraves of Indian Troops.THE symbols of their faith will also be carved on the headstones of the soldiers of the Indian Armies who fought beside their comrades from England and throughout the Empire in France and Belgium in 1914-16; and of the Indian Labour Corps who have since worked and taken the risks of life behind the lines. A committee of the Commission has decided upon the form that these symbols should take, and has further recommended that a Mohammedan mosque and Hindu temple should be erected in France for remembrance of the sacrifice made by Hindus and Mohammedans alike in the war. The designs for these buildings have been submitted for approval in India. In all such matters the treatment of the bodies of these soldiers will be in strict conformity with the practice of their religions, and will be carried out under the supervision of native officers.

Treatment of Isolated Qraves.AFTER so many years of fighting over densely populated and civilised countries like France and Belgium, it is inevitable that there must be single graves and groups in positions where, when the life of the land goes forward again, they cannot be reached or tended. Some lie in what were once town or village thoroughfares, and will be so again ; others by the side of railway stations and goods yards, houses or factories, in arable or pasture fields, parks, gardens and the like. The objections to leaving these graves where they are need not be dwelt upon. No precautions save them from being encroached upon or obliterated in the course of time. There is, moreover, a strong sentiment among all ranks that such scattered graves look lonely, and the instinct of the Services demands that those who fell by the wayside should be gathered in to rest with the nearest main body of their companions.   That is what the Commission, with all due care and reverence, proposes to do.I^emoval of ^Bodies.IN view of the enormous number (over half a million) of our dead in France alone, the removal of bodies to England would be impossible, even were there a general desire for it. But the overwhelming majority of relatives are content that their kin should lie officers and men together  in the countries that they have redeemed. The Allied nations, too, have freely given their land to our dead for ever, and that offer has been accepted by the Governments. To allow exhumation and removal in the few cases where it has been suggested would, it seemed to the Commission, be undesirable, if only on the principle of equality, and, judging from what many gallant fighters have said and written before they in their turn fell, a violation, in all but a few special cases, of the desire of the dead themselves.
&quot;Battle  Memorials.W EMORIALS to commemorate the parts borne by particular armies, divisions, or regiments in I        1     campaigns and battles, such as, to name only a few, the Canadians at Ypres, the South Africans at Delville Wood, the Australians at Amiens, the British at the breaking of the Hindenburg line, will be advised  upon by a  fully representative military committee, and it is to be hoped that the best art of the Empire will give its services and advice in the designing of them.Suggestions from the Public.BUT the work so far has only been blocked out, and there is room and welcome for suggestions of every kind from the public throughout the world, whose servants the Commission are.     For example, it has been suggested that the entrance to individual cemeteries should carry a text or inscription, and it has been decided that monuments  should be   erected  to  the  dead whose graves are unknown, of a special form which has yet to be settled.    These  are points, among others, upon which the Commission would be grateful for expressions of opinion.The Progress of the U^ork.W EANTIME, the long and difficult business of identification and registration goes forward still ^/1 on all fronts. The various architects to whose charge the cemeteries have been allotted are preparing their designs for the planting and the building required in France, and steps are being taken to prepare dignified and characteristic designs for our cemeteries in the East and elsewhere. All this can be effected in reasonable time ; but there is no possibility of expediting the delivery of the headstones. More than half a million of these will be required, and at present there is not labour enough in all the world to cut, carve and letter them. While they are being made the wooden crosses will stand, and, where necessary, will be renewed; the registers will be filled and filed, and the cemeteries will be faithfully and reverently tended. 16

[As the facts herein contained (which have been submitted to the Imperial War Graves Commission and are confirmed by that body), as well as some of the arguments based on them, are only to be found scattered throughout various publications and many volumes of Hansard, it may be of some service to hon. members to present them in a collective and collated form. A perusal and due consideration of them will make it apparent that the change now proposed will wreck the whole scheme of the Commission, to which it has devoted nearly three years of arduous and patriotic labour. It is submitted that, in view of all the interests concerned, such a result would be nothing short of a national calamity. Special attention is called to Section 14 (p. 10) in which the deplorable position that has now arisen is made clear, and an effective remedy by the House, of Commons indicated. For Summary of Reasons see Section 15].WAR GRAVES.STATEMENT OF  REASONSin support of the Proposal of the IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION.THE TWO PROPOSALS.What the Commission Proposes. That in each cemetery there shall stand a large Cross of Sacrifice in a prominent position and domina-ting the whole ; and a Stone of Remembrance, bearing the words &quot; Their Name liveth for Evermore.&quot; That each headstone shall bear the Name, Number, Regiment, Army Rank, Regimental Badge, Date of Death, and the Symbol of Faith (Cross, or otherwise) of the dead man ; and further, whatever description or text his relatives desire, within necessary limits of length.While providing for these individual details, the Imperial War Graves Commission decided upon the principle that there should be equality of treatment and uniformity of design in all the memorial stones.The Counter Proposal. It is now proposed that this principle of equality of treatment should be abandoned.Sir James Remnant, on March 23rd, had the following Motion on the Paper : &quot; That in the opinion of this House, relatives of those who fell in the war should be allowed to erect monuments of their own choosing over the graves of their fallen relatives, subject to such regulations as to size as may be prescribed by the Imperial War Graves Corn-mission.&quot;   (Hansard, March 22nd, col. 79).The Motion being ruled out of order on the Army Estimates, on
2March 24th the question was again raised, as follows :-Lord R. Cecil : &quot; Whether he (the Prime Minister) will give an early opportunity to this House to express in the Division Lobby their opinion on the policy at present pursued by the Imperial Wai Graves Commission ? &quot;Mr. Burdett-Coutts : Before the Right. Hon. Gentleman answers this question may I ask if he can see his way to grant this request. As one who is strongly and conscientiously opposed to the policy of the Noble Lord I should like to see this matter discussed by the House.Mr. Bonar Law : This subject could, I think, best be raised on a Supply day, and my Noble Friend, the Patronage Secretary, is trying to arrange for the discussion in that way.   The matter is one which should, I think, be left to a free Vote of the House. (Hansard, March 24th, col. 402).iViscount Wolmer had a Motion on the Paper of April 13th, identical in terms with Sir James Remnanfs Motion, but preceded by the words : &quot;To call attention to the resentment aroused amongst relatives of fallen soldiers by the action of the Imperial War Graves Commission ; &quot;It is important to note that the question will be left to a free Vote of the House.REASONS IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMISSION.1. Basis of the Decision. The Commission (whose names are given on page 12) only arrived at a full and unanimous decision after a long, painstaking, and exhaustive consultation with the representatives of the principal interests involved- the army, the relatives of the fallen, religious denominations, artists and architects, and those who were qualified to speak for India and the Dominions. The outcome of this difficult and delicate task is clearly put in these words :-&quot; It was therefore ordained that what was done for one should be done for all, and that all, whatever their military rank or position in civil life, should have equal treatment in their graves.&apos;^It will be well to go at once to some of the opinions obtained ; and special attention is called to the serious position that will arise with regard to the Dominions if any change is made.2. The Dominions. At the Imperial War Conference in June, 1918, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and India being present in the persons of their high representatives, together with a full attendance of other Members of the Conference, the question of distinction of rank, private memorials, and a uniform type of headstone were discussed; and a Resolution approving the action* See Report to the Imperial War Graves Commission, by Lt.-Col. Sir Frederic Kenyon, K.C.B., Director of the British Museum.  November 14th, 1918.  H.M. Stationery Office.  Price 3d.
and decisions of the Imperial War Graves Commission, was passed unanimously.!Sir Robert Borden (Canada) proposed the Resolution; and on the question now at issue said : &quot;I am very glad that the principle of equality of treatment of all the graves has been laid down, and is to be carried out. It is en-tirely appropriate that among the ranks of the dead there should be no distinction. The work of the Commission seems to have been very carefully carried out, and their efforts commend themselves to my judgement.&quot;Mr. Hughes (Australia) in seconding the Resolution said: &quot; I entirely agree with what he (Sir R. Borden) has said with regard to the gratitude we owe to the Imperial War Graves Commission for the manner in which they have carried out their work. I join with him in expressing my complete satisfaction with that part of their recommendation which proposes to do away with all dis-tinctions of rank. Speaking for the Commonwealth which I have the honour to represent, I feel perfectly sure that that will be re-ceived with general satisfaction.&quot;To bring the attitude of the Dominions up to date the letter pub-lished in the &quot; Times &quot; of April 21st, from Sir George Perley, HighCommissioner of Canada, to Mr. Churchill, Chairman of the Commission,must also be quoted.   In company with Sir Thomas Mackenzie, HighCommissioner of New Zealand, Sir George Perley had recently visited the war cemeteries in France, and on his return writes, with regardto the Motion in the House (see p. 1).&quot; This Motion seems to me to strike directly at the root of the principle of equality of treatment of war graves, which was accepted by the Imperial Conference of 1918, and especially supported by Sir Robert Borden and Mr. W. M. Hughes at that time. It was evidently regarded as one of the greatest importance, and you will find their views expressed on page 32 of the Conference Report. The Imperial War Graves Commission had adopted that principle as the basis of all its policy, and I have always thought that its decision in that respect gave general satisfaction.&quot;It was therefore on the faith of this feature of equality and uni-formity being carried out that the Dominion Governments agreed to take part in the Memorial, and to contribute their share of the expense.3. The Troops Abroad. Every opportunity was taken of consulting the troops in the field officers and men; the design was submitted and fully explained to all; small representative committees of units were formed for the purpose of ascertaining their views. In all cases the principle of equality and uniformity in the memorial stones was warmly welcomed and approved. Many of those who gave that opinion now lie in the graves in question and speak to us in the voices of the dead. A remarkable letter on this subject will be placed at the disposal of Hon. Members.f See Blue Book Cd. 9177 &quot; Imperial War Conference, 1918,&quot; pp. 29-33.   Presented Oct., 1918.
4. Demobilised Soldiers.-The two large organisations of men who have served in the war and arc now at home, viz. : The Comrades of the Great War,The National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers,on hearing of the proposed Motion in the House, passed Resolutions specifically urging equality and uniformity.These Resolutions derive additional weight from the fact that representatives of these bodies together with those ofThe National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers (Head-quarters, Middlesbrough),went to France to view the work of the Commission, and have returnedfully satisfied.   A report of their visit states:; &quot; Regarding the Cemeteries, when these are completed, I am con-confident no monument to the dead will be more impressive or beautiful than the British Cemeteries in France and Flanders.&quot; D.S.S. Bulletin, April 15th, 1920.)5. Trades Unions. In May, 1919, the Trades Unions Congress Parliamentary Committee, representing some four and a half million working people, addressed a Memorial to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, President of the Commission, strongly advocating the principle of equality of treatment adopted by the Commission. Referring to the &quot; movement set on foot to allow those relatives who can afford it to put, up Memorials of their own choosing on the graves of their dead,&quot; the Memorial, while sympathising with such a natural desire, states : &quot; When the widows and mothers of our dead go out to France to visit the graves they will expect to find that equal honour has been paid to all who have made the same sacrifice, and this result cannot be attained if differences, however restricted, are allowed in the character and design of the memorials erected over the graves.&quot;Mr. Harry Gosling, a member of the Commission (representing Labour), in a letter dated April 21st to all Labour Members, strongly urged them to oppose the Motion in the House attacking the policy, of the Commission.6. Some Results of the Proposed Change.-Apart from the question of the Dominions, it is in face of the great body of opinion just quoted, representing in the main those very classes which have not the means to provide &quot; memorials of their own choosing/&apos; that we have to consider the demand now made by a special section more fortunately placed. It is a difficult and painful task which the directorate of the Imperial Commission must have felt keenly to deny to those who have suffered grievous loss, and borne their sorrow so bravely, any consolation they might find in exercising the privilege indicated. It can only be hoped that the latter will give due and generous consideration to the results
involved in such a fundamental change in the scheme of the Commission. These may be briefly stated : (a) It will favour a comparatively small minority, as compared with a great majority.(b) It will set up a distinction between rich and poor, both of whom have made the same sacrifice and suffered the same loss.(c) It will,render impossible, even in its vaguest form, that Equality -of Treatment which is the. basal and accepted principle of the scheme. For it will make it necessary to consult the relatives in all cases. This means that the relatives of nearly 500,000 dead (in France and Flanders alone) will have to be circularised. A great many of these are a floating population ; years have elapsed since their loss occurred ; some cannot be traced. To be just, replies would have to be received from all. These would be sure to contain an infinite variety of suggestions, many of them impossible to carry out and all greatly complicating the work of the Commission. The difficulties will be even greater with regard to -relatives in the over-sea Dominions.(d) Consequently, apart from large increase of cost, the work in hand would have to be stopped, no new work could be begun on any cemetery, and the completion of the scheme would be delayed for a much longer period than now estimated. Further cost and delay will be entailed by the impossibility of standardisation if the monuments are to be different in form and design (see below, Section 12, page 9).Apart frorn this group of objections, there are others which must be indicated separately.7. An Imperial and National not a Private Memorial.-The con-trast between the two was recognised from the first by the Commission ; but it seems to be lost sight of by those who now claim distinctive treat-ment. This Memorial is to&apos;be erected by, and at the charge of, the State. It is not intended to express only, or mainly, the personal sorrow of relatives. It is a collective tribute by the Empire and the Nation to those who all alike made the same sacrifice for the same cause, arid between whom therefore, as individuals, no distinction of rank, position, or means should be made apparent. The object of the&apos; Commission is to represent, in a foreign land and to future generations, the whole British Empire joining as one. great unit to defend by arms, and if necessary to die for, the freedom of nations and the freedom of man. This central.ideal can only be preserved by.equality and uniformity, of the gravestones, both in design and ordered arrangement, throughout the 2,000 cemeteries, in France and Flanders. So in;,years.to come,; as travellers from.! all nations move from cemetery to cemetery the impression of this ideal willbe cumulative in its effect, and will tell to the world with simple but overpowering force the story of the unity and devotion of the British Empire.
Those who are now urging a change in this noble scheme, and who* argue that they should have the same liberty with regard to it as is-accorded in cemeteries at home, have an obvious way out of the difficulty. If they have the means to erect personal memorials and all must deeply sympathise with the desire the natural place for these is in&apos; the homeland amidst surroundings where their dear ones lived, &quot; where-their memorial will be constantly before the eyes of relatives and des-cendants, and will serve as an example and encouragement for the generations to come/&apos; The great mass of relatives, who cannot afford special monuments abroad, are equally unable to avail themselves of. this privilege at home. /8. Design of the Headstones.-In order that the headstones should, embody and carry out the ideal set forth, uniformity in their design is essential. To secure this many diverse sentiments, national, religious,, and aesthetic, had to be taken into careful consideration. The delicate task of fulfilling to the utmost in one design the sentiments and feelings of the relatives, and of harmonising the suggestions of many distinguished architects (whose names appear on p. 12) was entrusted to Sir Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum. This is not the place to. enlarge upon the fine feeling, judgment, and sympathy with all the interests concerned, which he has brought to bear throughout the. performance of these duties. The design of the headstone has been, widely reproduced* and the details as to identity of the dead man, and. other matters, are enumerated in the first paragraph of this Paper-It only remains, therefore, to indicate the very general opinion, that the design is instinct with the spirit of Christianity, justly definite in view of the religion of our race, but tolerant so as to include the many Churches, branches, divisions and sects of the Christian faith, all of which probably contributed their quota to the fighting forces, The place of Christianity, and of the soldiers belonging to that faith, in the great war is further emphasised by the large white stone Cross of Sacrifice, bearing a Crusader&apos;s sword, which stands conspicuously in each cemetery. The non-Christian religions, especially those within, the British Empire, which contributed so many brave lives to our ulti-mate victory, are specially provided for in the Symbol of Faith inscribed, on their headstones, and are covered, like all the rest, by the Stone of Memory to be placed in each cemetery.9. The question of a Cruciform Monument - A claim has been made in a certain quarter that the headstones should be entirely ot cruciform design. After what has just been said it is unnecessary to enter into polemics on this subject. It may be well, however, to point out that the use of the cross alone as a sepulchral monument is of com-paratively recent date. It is hardly to be found in old graveyards.. In modern ones, even those of the Church of England, it is rare in* See &quot; The Graves of the Fallen,&quot; by Mr. Rudyard Kipling. H.M. Stationery Office, and any, bookseller.   Price 6d.
I48comparison with the headstone. This shows that the Commission, whose duty it is to cover the widest ground of sentiment, in deciding upon the headstone have acted in agreement with the general practice.While we are on this subject it should be stated, with regard to the cross on the headstone adopted by the Commission, that an option is given to relatives and to regiments of dealing with it in either of two ways, both being illustrated in Mr. Rudyard Kipling&apos;s book (see foot-note p. 6). Either the cross can be a large one, with the regimental badge on its centre (ib. p. 10) or it can be slighter in form, with the regimental badge apart at the top of the stone (ib. p. 13). The difference may be important to some minds, and the option given shows the con-cern of the Commission to provide for religious scruples, whenever possible. In the three experimental cemeteries already completed in France (at Le Treport, Louvencourt, and Forceville) both the forms described are to be seen.A deeply pathetic interest attaches in the minds of relatives to the wooden crosses erected over the graves of the fallen, and nearer in time to their fatal deeds of heroism. These are already breaking up ; but, in their sympathy with this very natural feeling, the Commission has pro-vided for sending them home wherever desired. In some cases complaint has been made of crosses constructed out of propellers being removed, on the assumption that they would be permanent. It was found, however, that they also are tumbling to pieces, and could never have formed lasting memorials.10. The Difficulties.-There are, however, difficulties, technical and otherwise, of an almost insuperable kind attaching to an entire cruciform monument. *(a) A change in this respect would disturb the whole scheme of the cemeteries already arranged for, and in part laid out, owing to the greater width required for that shape of monument. The outside limits of width of the headstone must be determined by the actual width of the existing graves, on an average 1 ft. 3 in. for each headstone. It is a rule of the Commission (which testifies to the spirit of reverence that guides them) in no case to move or touch a body unless it is absolutely necessary, and whenever two or more bodies lie in one grave, the question of the width to be allowed for the headstones is a difficult one.(b) It is impossible to inscribe the necessary details now appearing on the headstone in the smaller space available on a cross.(c) A cross, owing to its form, is far less permanent than a head-stone.(d) It would delay the work in hand for a very long time, owing to difficulties of standardisation (see Section 12, p. 9) and the necessity* See the Commission^ &quot; Memorandum on Headstones,&quot; exhibited in the House of Commons Tea Room, February, 1920.
of circularising relatives (see Section 6, p. 5).(e) If it is proposed that the relatives are to pay for a cross, only those who have the means to do so would be able to exercise the freedom of choice. If the nation is to pay the cost, the finding of the Commission and its technical advisers holds good, viz., that it has been impossible to devise any satisfactory cruciform monument compatible with the space available, and other conditions.Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Design.-This design was submitted to the Commission and also exhibited in the House of Commons. It consists of a shorter headstone with a correspondingly short cross on the top, the whole being within the limits of height and width (1ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. 6 in.) available under the regulations. Most of the difficulties described in the last paragraph attach to this design, especially those of space for inscriptions, permanence, standardisation, and delay.&apos; 11. Horticultural Adornment-Whatever difference of opinion there may be about the gravestones, no one will question the advantage of any varieties that nature can provide being utilised to adorn the diverse sites and soils of the cemeteries. Variety in that respect will only add to the significance of the ordered uniformity of the gravestones. This important duty has been rightly placed in the hands of the Royal Botanical Gardens at i Kew. The work began while the war was still going on, under three officers having special knowledge of the subject, and of indefatigable energy and resource. Now, this number is largely increased ; there is a staff of non-commissioned officers, all of whom held important horticultural posts at home before the war ; and a large body of gardeners ; all these being distributed over the wide field of operations covered by the cemeteries.The necessity for expert treatment is obvious, looking at the great variations (described in the next Section) in the ground occupied, and the conditions of soil and exposure to be met with. Where the ground is barren the whole surface, to a considerable depth, has to be replaced by a more fruitful top-soil. In bleak positions screens of trees and shrubs must be grown, to break; the force of the prevailing wind. In cemeteries where men from our Over-seas Dominions lie, the attempt is being made to grow trees, shrubs and flowers, belonging to their own home-lands.* These three examples will indicate the arduous character of the task and the sympathetic spirit that pervades it. There is solace in the thought that in future years the beauties of nature, and many of the1 English flowers and green trees we love so well, wilTenrich and smile over the land which our heroes won back or held for France and Belgium.It is germane to the purpose of this Statement to add that the whole of this great work by- the Directorate of Kew ds undertaken in co-operation with and under the authority of the Commission ; and that the ultimate effect will necessarily depend on the harmony initiated, and to be pre-served, between the planting and the settled architectural design.* See &quot; Our Soldiers Graves,&quot; by Capt. A. W. Hill, in the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Journal for October, 1919 an article of thrilling interest, deserving of a much wider publication.
12. Magnitude and Complexity of the Commission^ Task.-It needslittle to justify this heading beyond the bare statement that there will be between 2,000 and 3,000 cemeteries and nearly 500,000 headstones to be erected in France and Flanders alone.  But something must be said as tothe great variety of the cemeteries in site, size, and disposition.&quot; These may be of very various sites. . . . Some of them are in towns or villages. . . . Others are in open country, which may present all kinds of natural features ; sometimes flat, sometimes muddy and sodden, somestimes undulating, sometimes surrounded by trees, sometimes with little or no background, some-times near roads and sometimes far away. Some are in woods, some in orchards, some in open fields, some along the edges of roads, some are still in use, and consequently are being progressively enlarged; others are enclosed, the land acquired, and have not further possibility of alteration of boundaries. Other cemeteries, again, have been formed during the progress of fighting, when opportunity has occurred (as it often did not occur) of collecting and burying the dead on the field of battle. For these there was little choice of site ; and they may be found anywhere in the areas where the armies have fought.&quot; (Sir F. Kenyon&apos;s Report. See footnote p. 2).Moreover, in harmonising the diverse sentiments, national, religious and aesthetic, inseparable from such a task, the Commission has had to meet and overcome technical difficulties of a most perplexing kind at every step. Some of these have already been indicated; but one, spe-cially applicable to stone memorials, of whatever type, may be given as an example.&quot; Owing to the unprecedented magnitude of the work and the very limited supply of skilled labour, as large a measure of stan-dardization as possible is necessary with a view to overcoming the difficulties of manufacture, packing, transport, handling and g.e.e-tion. Also the shape of the headstones should be such as does not expose them to any undue risk of breakage or damage in transit.&quot;This affects the whole subject of differentiation of design. It is -obvious that standardization, essential in the matter of both cost and time, would be impossible if the contracts had to be broken up between various forms of monuments. It may seem out of harmony with the solemn and pathetic purpose of the Memorial to speak of these material difficulties, but they constitute an insuperable obstacle to the proposed change, and the House of Commons is not likely to ignore them.13. The Constitution of the Commission;-The Imperial War Graves Commission was constituted by Royal Charter in 1917 on therecom-&apos; mendation of the Imperial War Conference. It was felt that as those who had died for their country came from every part of the Empire and are buried together as they fell, all the Governments must be represented in the sacred duty of erecting the Memorial. The body thus constituted is, therefore, an Imperial not a National one, and India and the Dominions pay their share of the expense. This makes it all the more impossible to sanction any departure from the principle of equality of treatment .and uniformity of design, which was accepted from the first, and upon
the faith of which (as is pointed out in Section 2,) the Dominions joined the Commission. A full list of the Members of the Commission, and Architects and others consulted, follows at the end of this Statement.14. The way must be cleared.-It is of the utmost importance that the House should realise the position in which the Imperial War Graves Commission is now placed by the Motions quoted at the beginning of this Statement. These bring to a head the opposition to their scheme which has hitherto been displayed by Questions put to Ministers and by letters to the Press (from more or less privileged persons) throughout the past year. The result has been greatly to hamper and delay the Commission in its patriotic task. At every point in the complicated details new difficulties arise, and progress is arrested by the uncertainty with regard to the essential principle of equality of treatment and uniformity of design. If the policy is changed many contracts now running would have to be cancelled. It would affect not only the headstones but the laying out of every cemetery. Estimates framed of the cost would become worthless. Some 50,000 verifications, which have taken 18 months&apos; to complete, involving correspondence with the next-of-kin in every case, would all have to be re-opened in order to ascertain if they desired to exercise a freedom of choice as to monuments.It is not too much to say that the whole work on this great Imperial and National Memorial is now paralysed by this fatal atmosphere of doubt. The way of the Commission must be cleared once for all, so that they can be free to get on.Under these circumstances it will not be sufficient to defeat the motion under notice, if the House should so decide, when it is brought forward. A negative decision would still leave the matter open and the Commission liable to some new attack, indirectly perhaps involving its main principle, and certainly further hampering its progress. Therefore, if the motion is made, an Amendment will be moved which will enable the House, if it so wills, to directly confirm the principle of equality of treat-ment and uniformity of design adopted by the Imperial War Graves Commission, and the entire policy connected therewith.15. Summary. The Reasons for supporting the principle of the Commission, viz., Equality of Treatment and Uniformity of Design, and for opposing any attempt to change or vary that policy, may be briefly summarised as follows: 1. The engagement with the Dominions and India cannot be broken.   (Sections 2 and 13).2. The troops abroad (many of whom now lie in the graves in question) wherever consulted were unanimous in their support of the policy.   (Section 3).
3. Demobilised and Discharged Soldiers, through the medium of their three great organisations, support it.   (Section 4).4. The Trades Unions and representatives of Labour support it. (Section 5).5. The proposed change would favour only a small minority, set up a &quot;distinction between rich and poor, increase the cost, and delay the work.   (Sections 6 and 10).6. The Memorial is a collective tribute by the Empire and the Nation, and therefore should not discriminate between individuals.   (Section 7).7. Christianity, as the predominant Faith of our race, is fully evident in the design, and the treatment of cemeteries. (Section 8).8. A Cruciform Monument, either entire or in part, presents insuperable difficulties, technical and otherwise. (Sections 9 and 10).9. The Horticultural adornment, which will be conspicuous in the cemeteries in the future, is carefully harmonised with the architectural design as settled by the Commission. (Section 11).10. The magnitude and complexity of the task, which has pro-ceeded on the Commission^ lines for two years and involves many technical difficulties, greatly adds to the delay that would be caused by any change in the design.   (Section 12).11. The constitution of the Commission by Royal Charter makes it an Imperial body, in which the Dominion Governments and India have taken their place on the faith of the declared principle and policy of the Commission.   (Section 13).12. The Commission^ progress is hampered and arrested by the uncertainty now created. This must be cleared up once for all, to enable the Commission to get on with its work. (Section 14).I must express my acknowledgments to Maj.-Gen. Sir Fabian Ware, who brings well-known gifts and a sympathetic temperament to the aid of a most difficult task, and his able chief-assistant, Col. Lord Arthur Browne, for enabling me to fill in some details in the preceding pages. This Statement, however, was first prepared entirely as a matter of public policy, and without any communication with the Commission.It is with great respect that I submit this Statement to hon. members, in the hope that it may be of some practical use in enabling them to come to a wise decision on this now urgent question. If any excuse is needed for my doing so, I would seek it in my thirty-five years&apos; membership of the House of Commons, which has taught me to have faith in the common sense and justice of the House, in its inherent aversion to narrow or sectional views, and its sincere desire to help and not to impede any
great patriotic effort such as that set forth in these pages. One thing is necessary for this purpose full knowledge and understanding of the facts of the case. It was only on finding that this was not easily available in the busy life of hon. members, that I undertook the task of collecting the information which is now placed at their disposal. I hope it will throw new light on the subject, and lead to a decision in accordance with the wishes and opinions of that great and indistinguishable mass of mourners whose voices can only find expression through the medium of the House of Commons.W.
