This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos; SECRET, %l. , 223THE   CABINET.PRESENT CONDITIONS IN SOVIET RUSSIA. -jggMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR1 circulate herewith a report by Brigadier General, A. J. Turner, C.M.G., D.S.O., of the British Baltic Military Mission, on the present conditions in Soviet Russia.w. s. c.The War Office,l\th May, 1920.Introduction. One hesitates to commit to paper any opinion regarding the state of affairs in Russia, the question is so complex and the information so divergent, that to arrive at a correct appreciation of the situation is no easy matter.In general only two sources of information exist: firstly, Soviet representatives, or visitors of distinctly Bolshevik views; and secondly, Russians and prisoners of other nationalities of very strong conservative or reactionary tendencies.From the very start, therefore, it is almost impossible to get a true picture of the conditions in Russia to-day. As a small example, the following incident might be quoted : Mr.. Lansbury wires that in Moscow all trains are met by a service of droshkies ; while an ex-Russian officer, a refugee from Moscow, states that horses have nothing to eat, and die where they stand in the streets, and are eaten by the mongrels that wander about the town in search of food.However, there do exist a few observers to whose reports a certain credence may be attached. In particular certain Lettish officials who have recently returned from Moscow, where they were employed on a Red Cross delegation. Another class of people from whom information can be obtained is the Soviet representatives now in Reval, who, when not in the public eye, are occasionally prepared to discuss openly and frankly their views as to the future of Russia.Furthermore, as a result of peace between Esthonia and Russia, a certain amount of private correspondence is passing through to these countries, and in these letters glimpses of the truth are sometimes revealed.The Report is submitted under two main headings&apos;: &quot; The attitudes, activities and conditions of the various classes of Eussian people&quot;; and secondly, &quot; The general .material conditions of the country.&quot; The subject is so vast, and the means of gaining information so slow and uncertain, that such a report is naturally very incomplete.Headings of Report. 1. The various classes of people in Russia may, for the purpose of this Report, be divided as follows : (a.) Soviet leaders. (b.) Workmen, (c.) The army and navy. (d.) Peasants.(e.) Intelligentsia and bourgeois.(f.) A small class drawn from various social grades, still actively opposed to Bolshevik Communist principles.2. The conditions in Russia are referred to under the following headings: (a.) Conditions of life in town and country.lb.) Commercial.(c.) Political.Id.) Communications.(e.) Agricultural.[f.) Industrial.((/.) Financial.(B20/192)   100  5/20  H&amp;S   8156wo
3. A few short notes on propaganda are also attached.4. The following subjects are not dealt with in this report: Education. Art.Religion.1. Classes of People in Russia.Soviet Leaders. Soviet leaders are beginning to realize, and even admit, that they do not represent the Russian people as a whole, and amongst those at Reval there were some who, with an air of pathos, complained bitterly that the name of &quot; Soviet&quot; stank in the nostrils of all civilized people. Furthermore, they realize now that there is no great hope of successful Bolshevik propaganda pursuing its advance westward. It is considered by some that even their constant efforts at organizing risings amongst eastern peoples, originally the outcome of ideals of world revolution, are now only continued in a spirit of revenge on the Great Powers, particularly England, who have refused to defile themselves by intercourse with the Soviet; and many of the present leaders of the Soviet feel they must confine their energies primarily to setting their own house in order, and thereby justify their views which have been expressed and spread throughout the world with such energy regarding the happy and well-organized state they promised to create.As evidence of the gradual change of mind denoted above, one may cite their obvious desire to get into close contact with the western capitalist States for purposes of re-opening commercial relations ; also the attitude of the Reval delegates, whose one object now seems to be to obtain locomotives Cor means of transport, and to obtain the advice and assistance of capable organizers from the western world to regenerate their country.Memoranda recently circulated among the higher Soviet authorities show a far more pessimistic outlook, showing that it is realized that the time for high-sounding phrases is now over and that all must seriously consider the definite physical problems of the future.Workmen.&apos; The position of the industrial workers in Russia is somewhat difficult &apos;to appreciate. They were among the prime movers of the original revolutionary movement, and the extreme length to which their counsels have led Russia should have satisfied their wishes, but, as in all parts of the world, they are likely to remain the most discontented section of society. The highly educated workman has in many cases taken up the more lucrative profession of Commissar, others have found conditions in the army more satisfactory. This will result for some years in the paralysis of industry, unless the very strongest and most autocratic measures are taken by Soviet leaders with regard to these workmen. This in a way will be a reversion to the very principles which Bolshevism set out to destroy, and will form another chapter in the general education of Bolshevik leaders in the principles of government. Labour risings are not unlikely, but it is extremely doubtful if any benefit to the workmen or to the&quot; country can possibly accrue.The workmen receive large salaries, anything from 20,000 to 25,000 roubles a month, and, in many cases, are paid whether they are working or not. It is reported that a compulsory 12-hour working day has been established.In spite of the heavy wages, a certain number of workmen are now leaving the towns in hopes of being able to support themselves in greater comfort on the land.The Labour Party, as an organization, has ceased to exist in Soviet Russia. Several attempts on the part of the workmen to establish their rights have been mercilessly met by force, and, since the militarization of industries, they have no voice in the matter. /All attempts to run factories, workshops, &amp;c, on Communistic lines have failed.The workmen have lost all interest in politics, and, for their benefit, the Bolsheviks organize compulsory meetings and lectures, at which resolutions are passed without debate or voting.It will be seen that Bolshevism, far from producing an Elysium for workers, and far from being the panacea for all the evils of capitalism, has brought discontent and misery upon all classes of labourers, industrial and agricultural.The leaders are finding that until the spirit of responsibility of duty to State and neighbour, and of social discipline is born, the most autocratic measures will always be necessary for the handling of large masses of uneducated men, and for the efficient
o oadministration of the vital services of a State. As a consequence, labour in Russia is to-day suffering from an oppression more severe than before, and far more severe than exists in the so-called capitalist countries, where they are supposed to be slaves.Russian labour has long hours, no redress for grievances, little or no political voice, and lives under the worst physical conditions.The Army and Navy-The Army. The outward results of the past months are that the Red Army lias thoroughly defeated all White forces, in spite of every possible assistance, financial and material, given by the leading Powers. Full use is made of this, with very considerable effect upon the ex-Russian oflicers, who are now joining the lied Army, and also upon the Red soldiers. The number of Russian officers who are now joining the Red Army increases daily, and includes many well-known men, with the result that all the higher commands are entrusted to them, it is believed also that these officers are quietly acquiring a great influence in the army, and, as few of them are really Bolshevik by conviction, their presence and &quot;influence may become a great stabilizing factor in the future.Soldier Councils have ceased to exist. Again, an iron discipline prevails; and, lastly, the soldier, to the exclusion of all other classes, has been clothed and fed, and is even in a position to send food to his family to supplement the smaller rations given to non-combatants.The general result of this is that the army is considered as a strong and fairly well organized force. The universal experience, however, of Allied officers employed either in North Russia or the Baltic provinces is that, with all these advantages, the value of the Bolshevik troops as a military weapon is contemptible. So long as the troops opposing them are not thoroughly impregnated with propaganda, the Bolshevik troops, however great their numerical and artillery superiority, have seldom shown any ability or desire to push home an attack. This was particularly the case in the recent operation on the Ksthonian front, where the Bolo attacked the Esthonians with at superiority of about six to one, and supported by superior artillery, and yet the attacks were never a source of even anxiety to the Esthonian Command. In the defence, equally, the Bolshevik troops are not able to withstand any serious attack. On the first signs of a successful attack the whole front crumples, and large numbers willingly surrender. Of course, certain Communist detachments fight bravely and well, but they are a small percentage of the whole army., The military situation to-day is such that there is no White Army which consti-tutes a menace to the Soviet regime, nor have either the Baltic provinces or Poland any further aggressive designs on Russia. Soviet-land has, therefore, no immediate need for large forces for defensive purposes. Further, though she has probably intentions of carrying on an offensive against Poland, or the remnants of Denikins force, the numbers which can be maintained on these fronts are limited, and thus she is now in a position of having an army far greater than the military situation demands. At the same time, she is not entirely confident that a new situation will not arise when her present forces may bo required, and her authorities are also thoroughly aware what a great disturbing factor the demobilization of large numbers of men will be in the country at large under existing conditions, when employment is nil and only soldiers are properly fed ; indeed, such a measure would probably result in the overthrow of the Government and the downfall of the Soviet power. These conditions have brought about the formation of labour armies, the existence of which has already been reported to you. The entire military organization has been maintained, and the labour armies could at once be reorganized into field armies. The crying needs for improved means of transportation will for a time give ample occupation for these armies, and the work on which they are employed is of such a nature that numbers and military organization and discipline will produce good results. Wood-cutting for fuel, clearing snow on railway tracks, improving roads and railway tracks, are all work of this nature. Subsequent!)&apos;, however, when such work is completed, it is difficult to see how such an organization will cope with agricultural and workshop demands, and it will probably be a hopeless failure. Nevertheless, it is believed that the labour armies will be maintained until such time as the economic reconstruction of the country has reached such a stage as to permit the demobilization to be carried out without undue danger. This period will depend entirely on how quickly the opening of trade will effect improvements in the means of transportation, which is the first necessity before the country can possibly settle down. But until the Labour Armies are demobilized they must always be regarded as a large military reserve which can be transformed into a military weapon at very short notice.(816(5) A 2
Army rations lj lbs. of bread daily.4 lbs. of oatmeal weekly.Very little meat (all. horse flesh),The Navy. The Bolshevik Fleet. Neue Preussisehe Zeitung reports that Soviet Russia has a strong fleet. They have five large battleships, amongst which are ships of the &quot; Gangut&quot; type. Besides these they have also liners &quot;and report Pervosvanny,&quot; &quot; Respublika,&quot; the cruisers &quot; Riurik,&quot; &quot;Bogatyr&quot; and &quot;Svetlana&quot; (new); cruisers &quot; Diana,&quot; &quot; Admiral Makarov,&quot; &quot; Baian&quot; and &quot; Avrora.&quot; have been for some time at the Petrograd shipyards. Of large destroyers they have but six, one of them being called &quot; Garibaldi.&quot;   A number of hydroplanes are kept at Oranienbaum.The fleet suffers from lack of coal, but if the supply improves the Bolshevik fleet will have to be taken into consideration.There are as yet no reports to hand referring specially to the discipline and state of morale amongst naval ratings, but it may be presumed, with a, certain amount of certainty, that owing to the proximity of the fleet to Petrograd, which has always been a centre of extreme forms of revolutionary propaganda, and to their enforced idleness, it is probably inferior even to that of the army.Naval headquarters are reported as having moved recently from Petrograd to Moscow.   This is not the first sign of a possible transfer of the capital from Petrograd.^Peasants. &quot; The dark people,&quot; as ever, remain the body and the heart of Russia, and the foreign elements who, during the past two years, have controlled the destinies of this country, have not fully realised this. The peasant and the land worker will, probably always be indifferent to politics and propaganda emanating from those in high places.   He is concerned with his house, his cow, and his small bit of land.In South Russia his choice between Denikin and Lenin was made on the one question of land only. Lenin promised him land, while he feared that Denikin would take it away.When the principles of communism were first being put into force, the land was equally divided among all classes of peasants, the result so often overlooked by idealistic reformers occurred, that the more industrious worker was penalised at the expense of the lazy and illiterate, and further, in the early days when equality for all men was the cry, any peasant who, through energy and initiative, amassed greater wealth than his neighbour, was likely to be persecuted. Since those days, however, the Soviet authorities have learnt a little wisdom, and their present policy is rather more to encourage the slightly better class and more hard-working type of peasant, while the lazy and incompetent labourer continues to be employed as a labourer rather than as a private owner of land.The peasants are now in a very strong position; they have a certain amount of land, and above all, a sufficiency of eatables, and refuse to part with land produce for Bolshevik money.   Exchanges are effected with towns for industrial products and salt.It is not considered probable that there will be any peasant rising on a large scale. In the first place, there is no organization existing for such a movement, and in the second place, it seems to be realized that, bad as things are, they are better than they used to be, and furthermore, they feel that the Soviet is unlikely to employ any coercive measures with regard to the supply of food, &amp;c, from the country areas, owing to the storm of opposition that would be roused. It is considered that 86 per cent, of the land has been divided up amongst small peasants, and that only 2 per cent, of the land now remains under Communists tenure. Officially and legally the land is supposed to be on lease to these peasants, but the latter regard it as their own property.The need for agricultural implements is enormous, and the factories are quite unable to cope with the demands.Intelligentsia and Bourgeois. This type presents an interesting psychological study. At no time in the past history of Russia have these people ever been gifted with any great energy or initiative. They are dreamers, philosophers and idealists, cultured in the arts, and with ready tongues. To be a student is sufficient r61e in life for many Russians. At the same time, these people do represent much that is best and most admired in Russian life. At present suffering and hunger have reduced these people almost to a state of coma, in which they can neither move nor think nor act. They exist, and like some elementary organism, search vainly for food and warmth. They are unable to work, and live by selling their clothes, furniture and jewels. As is known, cases occur of professors and women of society earning a few roubles by cleaning the streets.
The more intelligent leaders of the Soviet, realizing that cultured and scientific knowledge is necessary for the life of any State, endeavoured to establish newspapers and schools for the furtherance of these objects.It appears as if there was a gradual relenting of the remorseless attitude towards this t\p \ and unless this comes to pass, the future of Russia will probably be greatly handicapped by the absence of these qualities.There is no question, nor ever has been, of expecting any organized rebellion from this class, which includes most of what we call professional services, i.c, doctors, teachers, and the enormous number of people who work in offices either Government or private.It is a fact that the bulk of the remaining Intelligentsia is now employed by the Soviet Government, as this is their only means of existence. In general, disappointed by the failures of the last year, they are anti-Allied in views.Even were circumstances favourable for combined action, they are nearly certain to disagree amongst themselves.The small trader and commercial man is nearly always a Jew, and he has only two interests in life money and Jews and is not likely to produce any anti-Bolshevik energy, as the present regime is one that he has found extremely suitable. It gives him every opportunity for bribery and corruption, and he has taken full advantage of the situation to acquire the stolen valuables of the upper Russian classes, which, however great the difficulties, he has not failed to transport to Scandinavia and sell at vast profit. He has, in fact, every inducement to support any party which promises the continuance of unrest in Eastern Europe. This is apart from the International Jew, who is considered by many people as responsible for the course of events during the last few years in Russia, and whose ideals of life are power rather than small commercial activities.A -precis of a letter from a representative of the professional class is attached. Some of the middle classes are said to be buying up land secretly, and preparing the foil of the present regime.Letter from Professor at Petrograd. (Precis.) Petrograd has become a city of the dead. Worse than that, it has been ^compared to a lunatic asylum, with the inmates chattering at each other, and striving to amuse the visitors who come to look at them from time to time. That is the impression the educated classes have of .themselves and each other.Everyone&apos;s energy and intelligence is directed to the one ideal of not starving on a given day. All foresight for the next da v has long perished, and the vital necessaries of the morrow are sold recklesslv to mitigate the horrors of to-day.All shops and works are closed. Their former inmates have now realized the ideal of being officials. As such they walk aimlessly through the town for a miserable salary, and are satisfied with themselves, until, failing to buy anything from the peasantry, they curse the latter for the misery they themselves have brought about.Sanitation in any form has broken down, and the thaw is not far off.   Homes are unheated.   There is no light.This is the condition in which the intellectual class of Petrograd has chosen to stay rather than sever their connection with the country they love, because they feel that they are the last link between the old culture and art of Russia, and the barbarian state that Bolshevism has put up in its place.They do not reproach those who left Russia. They may be more useful to the cause abroad provided they were not guardians of a certain trust. But they claim to be remembered with the respect due to the sacrifice they have made, and not to be accused of staying on for the personal benefit that the existing regime gives.How can Koltchak, Denikin and Yudenitch conquer the country, when the way lies across the country&apos;s own blood ? War only increases the hold of the Bolsheviks over the country. Create a new Government with an ideal and a tradition to look up to-if necessary with a Tsar and then there will be no more need of the sword.They ask that the old people and the children may be saved out of the wreck of Petrograd, that there may be no slacking in the cause not of revenge or conquest  but of saving the remnants of a drowning1 nation.Opposition. Menshevih. Mensheviks, whilst strongly opposed to Bolshevism, are by no means in favour of Denikin, Koltchak and others.Their power is extremely limited, as they are not permitted to hold meetings, and as we have now learnt, the power of the spoken word amongst all classes of Russia is unlimited. They only have one newspaper, and are not represented on the Government, nor, it appears, do they wish for this representation.Their views appear to be moderate, and if from this class can arise that rare
individual, the intelligent Russian endowed with energy as well, they may, in the future play a considerable role in the reorganization. Their industrial policy is to nationalize all resources, but to leave the management of all industries to private initiative.Alexinsky, a social democrat leader who is convinced of the errors of extreme socialism, who was in Riga with General Yudenitch, stated that a special conference would take place ol all anti-Bolshevik parties in South Russia, representing in general a party which is calling itself &quot; The National Centre.&quot;He also spoke of the formation of a special peasant movement under Makhno.During their short stay in Riga, Generals Yudenitch, Vladimirov, Glasenap and Alexinsky expressed, in private and through the medium of the press their views on the general anti-Bolshevik question. These views do not appear to have undertaken any great change as a result of the last years happenings. They still continue to speak with a certain amount of confidence of future action against the Bolshevik forces.All good men are definitely against Bolshevism. But for the present they feel that any change would make the destruction of Russia more complete, as it would be subversive to order, which has now been established.2. Conditions in Russia.Conditions in town and country. Conditions in towns, according to all sources of information, appear to be deplorable. Conditions of all streets and houses are indescribably filthy, sanitation has almost ceased to exist.Hospitals are little better than death-traps.Public restaurants are now organized, but the food that can be obtained there is insufficient in quantity and revolting in taste. None of the ordinary amenities of civilized life exist, except for such officials as have been able, through the illegal amassing of large quantities of money, to obtain a certain amount of cojnfort.At the same time, an intelligent and unprejudiced observer recently reports from Moscow that very good order is. maintained, and that robbery and violence are no longer committed, as they were in the first days.Petrograd. The following table of averages on the Petrograd market, first in September then in December, 1919, illustrates the rise in prices in 3 months for absolute necessities : 	September, 1919.	December, 1919.

There is evidence to show that religion has not lost its grip on the masses, and that the churches in many parts of Russia, especially in Moscow, have been well filled.Education is practically at a standstill, and, though childrens schools do exist, the conditions of education are deplorable. No moral education is given, no discipline exists; boys and girls are educated together, and it is reported that the open immorality among the elder children is revolting to a degree, disease and childbirth being rife.
Commercial, The eyes of all the world are centred on Russia in its commercial aspect. Central Europe is starving, and industries throughout the world are calling for raw material. The great problem before all countries now is to what extent these hopes are likely to be realized.This problem again resolves itself into one of transportation. Without a solution of this absolutely crying problem, there can be no question either of fulfilling the needs of the Russian people or of exporting material surplus to their requirements. Owing to this and to the lack of agricultural implements and the general idleness and lack of productivity dining the past years, a considerable period must certainly elapse before large quantities of corn will be available for export. The available stocks of (Coal and much timber are likely to be required for rebuilding of mines, factories, &amp;c. One can anticipate, however, that a certain amount of flax and timber will be available for foreign trade, but in general the needs of the country itself are so great that it is doubtlul if the ordinary raw materials will be available in any large quantities for some months or years to come.With regard to the opening of trade with the co-operative societies, it is observed that the chief Russian representative has been recently negotiating with the Supreme Council on this question, but reports from Russia, including the final announcements of recognized leaders, show that the co-operatives have been nationalized, have no political representation and can have no independent control in the distribution of foodstuffs. It must by now be clear to the authorities at home that the theory of direct trade with co-operative societies is impossible. In fact, in this part of the world the public announcement of this policy is regarded as nothing more than a political bluff.In an interview with Birkenheim, the chief of the Russian Co-operative Society, Litvinov is reported now lo have declared that foreign imported goods can only be paid for in gold, and that the resources of the country do not permit of the export of raw material, and furthermore, that he was empowered to deal with all questions relative to co-operative societies.On the other hand, the following report of an interview with Gukovsky at Reval shows that possibly a quantity of flax and timber will be available for export: The Waba Maa representative had an interview with the representative of the Soviet Government, Gukovsky. He stated he intends to remain in Reval for . a long time. He has great hopes in Britain and the United States of America,, and intends to get into touch with merchants of these countries. In exchange for foreign goods, Russia will supply flax and timber. The Don coal mines, although they are in the hands of the Bolsheviks, cannot supply them with sufficient quantities of coal owing to the state of transport.Reference the rumours that Soviet Russia will maintain trade with co-opera-tives only, Gukovsky denies this, stating that the Soviet Government is willing to get into touch with every one who has got anything to sell. Trade in Russia is in the hands of the co-operatives, but the central committee, Moscow, controls all their actions.It&apos;appears that they now commence to respect foreign capital, and property formerly held by outside capitalists may yet be found intact when Russia is again opened up.The timber trade is at a standstill owing to lack of transport and consequent blockage of sawmills and timber centres. Moreover, the earlier reserve supply is exhausted, and the new supply is too wet to be of service either for burning or building.I have been informed by the American Commissioner that Esthonia is endeavouring with the gold recently given by Soviet Russia to effect a large contract for locomotives and agricultural machinery in America. As Esthonia has no need for locomotives herself, it is probable that the whole order is intended for Soviet Russia, and this is the opinion of Mr. Gade, and it is probable that Esthonia will hand over the purchases at a large profit to Soviet Russia.Politics, (a.) Foreign Policy.It appears tolerably clear that the Soviet Government has abandoned, at least for the time being and so far as the Western States of Europe are concerned, its policy of World&apos; Revolution.   This has been forced on to them by the necessity for
the co-operation of the Western States to prevent the present economic chaos from destroying the country beyond all redemption; she earnestly requires peace with her neighbours and the rest of Europe. It is hard to believe that such a change is not pure opportunism, and that if conditions improve in Russia, and the assistance of the Western States no longer vitally necessary, the final aims of the Bolshevik will once more be pursued with the greatest vigour.A vigorous campaign is being carried out towards Asia, where the Bolsheviks are not above utilizing the national spirit to further the cause of World Revolution. In India, Afghanistan, China, Japan, Persia, Egypt and Turkey they are apparently sparing no effort to create trouble for the Western Powers. Enver Pasha is evidently in close alliance with Moscow.The cessation of all propaganda, East and West, should he made an essential part of auv agreement with the Soviet Government.As regards their policy towards the Greater Powers, Soviet Russia as a political community has been in existence too short a time for the leaders to formulate any definite policy. Such a policy is bound at present, to be based only ou opportunism, and will favour that group of powers from whom they think they can get the best return, and therefore, any reliance on the Soviet Government to carry out its undertaking, under the present regime, would be most,unwise. There is little doubt that at present Germany is the most influential foreign power inside Russia, and that regular relations have for some time past existed between the two Governments. Germany, with the loss of her colonies, sees in Russia the only country from which to procure raw material, and the best direction in which to exploit her commercial aims, and she will not spare any effort to gain a predominant place in the future commercial life of Russia. Apart from these commercial ambitions, the advantages of a military alliance between the two is obvious to all, and affords Germany her only way to regain her military position in the future. Thus it is certain that Germany will try to the utmost of her power to gain a predominant place in Russia. It may be she thinks her best way of doing so is to ally herself with the Anti-Bolshevist forces, hoping with her help these forces may finally overcome the Soviet Government but, whatever her policy is to be, it is certain to be ruthlessly prosecuted, and with no regard to principle, and directed exclusively in the interests of Germany and Germany alone.Border States. Except in the case of Esthonia resulting from peace negotiations, there has been as yet no clear expression of policy with regard to the Border States, but from the various reports available, it appears that the present leaders are prepared to recognize the independent existence of the Border States and the Ukraine. In fact, the principle of self-determination seems one acceptable to the Soviet Government.Intervention. The present existence of order under Soviet rule must be carefully considered. Any active intervention which succeeded in overthrowing the Bolshevik regime would again throw the country into a state of chaos as far as the safety of persons and property are concerned.The problem of Russia has, therefore, two solutions : Are we to countenance the present state of affairs and trust that the organization will gradually improve, and that civilization and order will arise out of the dying embers of the lied Revolution, or are we to re-light the fire of battle and build anew when bloodshed has ceased again ?The Allied Powers are unprepared to support further military operations, and all points to the Soviet concluding an armistice or peace with all its neighbours. We are, therefore, thrown on the first solution, but if a stable Russia is desired, and undoubtedly it is essential to the future peace of Europe, this task must be tackled by all with the greatest energy, enthusiasm and sympathy.But guarantees and reforms of all kinds must be demanded, the cessation of propaganda and the abolition of the death sentence, the introduction of secret voting, a full pardon to all who fought for the Whites&apos; Armies, and permission to return to Russia, and other similar conditions. These conditions, in return for full recognition by the Powers, would probably be acceded to; whether they would be carried out is another matter.A few miscellaneous notes on general relations with foreign people are attached.British. It is reported that the English are the most hated foreigners in Russia, and also the most persecuted. This has been changing recently owing to the change in British policy. Only four English are at liberty in Moscow, the remainder are in concentration camps, and very badly treated. Mr North, the British Chaplain in Moscow, has formed a Committee for the relief of the British prisoners.German. There is a German Soviet in Moscow, the President of which is;
Rothnegel, who was arrested in Kovno on his way to liberate radek. He is now again in Russia, the Germans having obtained his release.It is reported that a number of German officers have been arrested in Helsingfors on their way to Russia. Included amongst these are supposed to be several of those demanded for trial by the Allied Powers.An account of the very considerable liaison by aeroplane between Germany and Soviet Russia has already been forwarded to you under B.B.M.M. 346 of the 4th March.French. There are several French Communists in Moscow, the chief amongst them are Petit, Pascal, Chapoigne, and Goilbeau, and the most of them are violently anti-British.General. There is also an Austrian Soviet.There are also several Chinese and Lettish Regiments in Russia.There are many ex-German prisoners in the Red Army.In Germany, Lenin&apos;s proclamation claiming Constantinople has been widely circulated.The Moscow Press reports that the Russian Soviet has now been recognized by the Social and Democrat Party of Czecho-Slovakia.It is reported from Vladivostock that in the peace treaty between the Czechs and Bolsheviks there is a clause concerning the establishment of a neutral zone between the Czech rear guards and the Bolshevik advance troops. The Bolsheviks will supply the Czechs with coal and receive gold taken from Irkutsk in exchange. After the signing of the Treaty, the Czechs will not support Bolshevik enemies.(b.) Interior Politics.The Congress of Soviets was supposed to be held every 6 months, but, in point of fact, no Congress was held during 1919. This Congress sat at the end of January and the beginning of February, in particular connection with the ratification of the Peace Treaty with Esthonia.At present there seems little hope of true political representation in Russia. Toting is not secret, and the Bolsheviks strongly control both the voting and the electioneering.The Co-operative Societies are no longer allowed representation or to conduct electioneering. This order has been given owing to the fact that in the Co-operative Elections, held in the Volga area under more peaceful conditions, only 5 per cent, voted for Communists, whereas in Petrograd the percentage was 40.System of political representations. Labourers, soldiers, sailors, peasants and Cossacks in any particular district or town form Committees of which representatives are elected to form the Town or District or Army Soviet. This Soviet elects representatives to form the Moscow Soviet.This Moscow Soviet elects : 1. A President.2. The All Russian People Commissars who form the Council of Commissars. h. The Executive Committee.The Soldiers, Sailors, &amp;c, Committees, and the District, Town or Army Soviets, elect their own Council of Commissars and Executive Committees.The Executive Committee in Moscow then directs all these Sub-Executive Committees direct, and not through the District Soviets.The Council of Commissars directs in the same manner.There is at present no real system of representation as the Soviets are a farce and have practically no power, as the Central Executive Committee, at the head of which is Lenin, directs everything and influences the selection of Representatives in all Soviets.The rising generation. In a way, perhaps the most serious problem of Russia, and the one most neglected, is the human regeneration. The Russian character, naturally emotional, weak-willed and prone to exaggeration, is not likely to have improved during the last five or six years. The influence of war, the lack of education and the constant surroundings of anarchy and bloodshed, the destruction of all that stands lor culture and the finer sides of life, cannot fail to produce the most disastrous effects upon the younger race of Russian men and women, and just at a time when their energy, clear thinking, and moral system is required to be at its best; and, if other countries have any policy towards Russia other than egoistical commercial enrichment, this problem must certainly be tackled with the greatest energy and sympathy.   Even(8156) b
from the egoisfs standpoint, it is to the interest of the Allied Powers to see that the future ruling classes of Russia are at least sufficiently intelligent and educated to form reasonable opinions for themselves, and do not come completely under the influence of Germany, who will never have any other aims but those of Germany, and who will for this reason remain the eternal enemy of Russia.Miscellaneous. -In spite of the recent announcement, the death penalty is still being carried out, and it is doubtful whether it will ever be abolished.Moscow wireless states that the result of the re-election for the Moscow Soviet was 98 per cent. Communists.   Total, 117 Communists, 6 Sympathisers, 2 No Party.Property. All property belongs to the State. Private ownership is forbidden. Wholesale requisitions take place continually, and no receipt is given for goods or property requisitioned.It is not known to what extent the recent report of Lenin that a people&apos;s assembly would be formed can be credited, nor whether his offer to withdraw the cancellation of foreign loans and offer mine concessions to Allied Powers is genuine.Communications. From the attitude of the Bolshevik Representatives at Reval, it appears to be realized that a solution of Russia&apos;s main problem of regeneration lies in transportation. In general, the ordinary facilities for moving from one part of the country have entirely ceased to exist. For instance, between Moscow and Kharkoff no passenger trains are running at all. Between Petrograd and Moscow only one train a day, which is partly a goods train and partly a passenger train. In general, civilians are unable to travel, and it is not uncommon for passengers to have to get out of the train in order to get wood to supply the engine. Except for a few main roads, Russia has, even in its best days, been badly off for transport by road, and the organization of labour has up to the present been so deficient that no repairs have been carried out for several months.Rolling stock has decreased to 30 per cent., the remainder being now laid up for a long time awaiting repairs. On some lines, parts have been taken up and laid down again elsewhere to repair the lines necessary for the army. On the Brest Litowsk  Moscow line one of the two parallel lines has been removed completely for the construc-tion of new lines on the South Russian (Denikin) front. It is noticeable that the lines removed are mostly those which Russia, on the advice of France, had laid near the German frontier, evidence of the important part Germany is playing in the military life of Soviet Russia.It is also reported that, owing to the general disorganization and lack of construc-tion work, their transport by river barge will not be properly re-established for some time to come.Under these conditions, it is clearly impossible for the country to re-establish the . normal conditions or for any measure of prosperity to be obt obtained. It is believed that any assistance from any country would be very welcome and would be backed up to the best of their ability by the Soviet Government, and it should be remembered that until some such steps are taken, the prospects of trade relations upon which such store has been set by most Allied industrial firms, are likely to be little short of hopeless.Postal and telegraphic communications are in a like condition, with the exception that there is not quite the same urgent need for telegraphic material. No postal fees are now being charged.Agricultural. Agricultural conditions have mainly been determined by the following factors : Lack of labour,Lack of transport, and lack of the necessary implements and machinery.With the advent of the latter, as the result of the opening of trade relations, the agricultural conditions of the country will probably recover sufficiently to supply in abundance the needs of the Russian population, but until the larger problems of transportation and financial relations of the outer world are solved, it is doubtful if sufficient products of this nature will be available to relieve the necessity which is now being felt throughout Central Europe.Industrial. The factories, mines and mills have been so neglected that in many cases they would have to-be rebuilt. Workmen have long been idle, and industry has been confined almost entirely to supplying the needs of the army. The regeneration of industry in Russia depends entirely on the provision of means of transport and technical machinery, there being no factories at all capable of supplying such essentials.Assistance, in both these cases must come from outside sources.    If and when
transport facilities permit, there probably exists sufficient coal for the present needs of any factories as may be put into working order.Attitude of the party in power. Attempts to adopt Communistic principles to Russian industries have brought them entirely to a standstill.Since the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks have been gradually changing their economic policy, and the power of the Workmens Councils is being supplanted by the dictatorship of so-called Specialists.At the head of this new policy, which is being built up on the lines of capitalistic industries, stands Krassin, the former director of the Russo-German firm, Siemens &amp; Schuckert. Private enterprise is permitted, but all produce goes to equip and supply the Red Army. A special commission for army supplies protects these private enter-prises from requisitions, and the Soviet Government pays them liberally.Recently, owing to the opposition of the Communists to Krassin&apos;s methods, Trotsky has brought forward a project for the militarization of industries and the organization of labour armies with military discipline; thus the Soviet Government is adopting methods of compulsion with the working classes.Generally speaking, one can observe that in Soviet Russia the Bolsheviks have discontinued the prosecution of speculators, close their eyes to the colossal profiteering of those who are working for the defence of Bolshevism, and are definitely compromising with capitalism.Financial. Financial conditions remain as ever, chaotic. Prices are enormouis. and in many cases wages and selling prices also.A case is reported of one family whose expenditure for a month was over a million Bolshevik roubles.No Budget has been prepared, and such financial statements as have been issued have been incorrect, out of date, and circulated only to a very small extent. &apos;1Bolshevik money continues to be issued, while, at the same time, Kerensky, Tsar and Duma roubles are still current. From time to time the value of one of the&amp;e currencies rises for no known reason, probably the result of Jewish handling of the market, as there exist in Russia*and in the Baltic Provinces quite a large class df human beings who have no means of subsistence other than speculating in the various currencies.The manufacture of false money continues. So far, English pound notes (believed to be fairly good) and English five-pound notes (reported very badly made), have been put into circulation. Dollars, Swedish kroners, and French francs are expected to be issued shortly.   These will probably be used for propaganda.When the Bolsheviks came into power in Russia there were 1,100 million roubles in gold in the State Bank. Through the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, 150 million roubles in gold was sent to Germany, leaving about 950 million roubles, of which 400 million to 500 million roubles had been evacuated from the capitals to Penza, where it came into Koltchak&apos;s hands. The greater part of this probably eventually found its way into foreign countries.The remainder 450 million to 500 million roubles remained in Soviet Russia, but, owing to the bad control and administration by the Bolsheviks, it is more than likely the greater part of this has found its way into private pockets.   &apos;Gukovsky, Soviet representative in Esthonia, stated that 35 million Tsar roubles have been deposited in Esthonian banks.3. Propaganda.&quot;Isvestia&quot;is still active for universal revolution, and reports that schools are being established in Moscow, where officers are being taught foreign languages for the purpose of military command in foreign areas.A proclamation was recently circulated in Reval calling upon the labourers to overthrow the present Government and establish Soviet regipie.Colonel Malone, M.P. The impression conveyed by Colonel Malone, M.P., as regards the conditions of affairs in Moscow is entirely erroneous. No attempt was made by him to consult Mr. North, the British Chaplain, or any independent opinion. The impression conveyed by him to the British public is entirely false and one-sided, and favourable only to the Bolshevik cause, which seems to have his sympathy.A secret conference is reported to be held in Moscow, during which Kamenev and Zinoviev were strongly in favour of confining their propaganda activities to the East, as they feared greater opposition should they continue offensive action against Poland.International revolutionary propaganda was originally directed by the Foreign
Office, but is now in the hands of the office of the &quot; Communist International&quot; (Moscow, No. 5 Deneshny Pereulok), an organization independent of the Soviet Government. The President of this Society is Sinowjero, and amongst the members are Lenin, Bucharin, and the Secretary, Bersin, a Lett. The only foreign member is Rudnjanski, an Hungarian. Up to September, hone of the European States had delegated anyone. Klinger, a Russian German, runs the business side of the Society.Lenin is connected with the office by means of a direct telephone line, and imme-diately receives letters and papers on their arrival. He often receives couriers for the purpose of obtaining first-hand information.A limited sum from the Government funds is at the disposal of the Society for for foreign propaganda. Funds for revolutionary organizations in foreign countries, which are usually in the form of diamonds, or pearls, are smuggled over the frontier in doubly lined leather boxes or in hollow heels on boots. In the cellar of Deneshny, No. 5 Moscow, is a workshop where the packing of the valuables is carried to a high art.The literary section of this Society issue a monthly periodical called The Communist International in Russian, French, English and German, and correspondence in the same languages. In addition to these, numerous brochures in the different European and Asiatic languages are prepared. Correspondence to be smuggled through is printed on thin silk paper.Communication with the outside world is very uncertain, papers often not arriving for three or four weeks. Socialist papers appear to be more valuable as representing the opinion of the country, and there is less censorship than is the case with the few Bourgois papers. Counter articles, in answer to articles which deviate from Bolshevik politics, are generally written by Lenin himself,The route from Russia westward for couriers, who generally travel as released prisoners of war, is usually via Kovno, but the route vid Latvia is also used.Internationalism is still being carried on energetically, though it seems to have been the subject of a sharp discussion.Lenin is for active propaganda, warfare all over the world, starting in Western Europe.Trotsky favours a concentration of energy on India and the East. Radek is reported to have advocated a suspension of all outside propaganda, all. energy to be concentrated on their own territory.A. J. TURNER, Brigadier-General,British Baltic Military Mission.Riga,15th March, 1920.
