They are indignant with the Co-operative Societies for overshadowing them in the Demonstration.The most serious factors during the week have &quot;been the rising prices and unrest among railwaymen and omnibusmen.   The &quot;Work to Rule&quot; strike is causing serious congestion at the goods depots and if it continues a further rise-^ln retail prices must ensue.   Opinions differ as to the prospects of an extension of the strike.   A well informed correspondent believes that after next Monday it will decline.The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee in London is trying, with some success, to prevent the despatch of munitions to Poland.Sinn Peiners in Great Britain are disappointed by the failures of the Liverpool strike and they have been unusually quiet.Some details are given of the circulation and financial position of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which is admittedly losing about  2,800 a week.There heve been attempts to tamper with the loyalty of troops and in one case a prosecution is probable.
THS COST OF LIVINGI am obliged, week by woek, to recur to the high cost of living because it is a source of unrest that may at any time become dangerous.   Since Mr, McCurdy&apos;s speech on Hay 6th I have received sixteen reports on the subject.   Tho extremists weloomo tho increases because they think that they aro a short cut to Revolution, or, to use their own words, &quot;It is no use holding protest moetings or appealing to the Government to fetch down tho prioes; the best thing is to let things slido until the people rise in revolt.&quot;As forecast in my report of April 29th, the meeting of the Triple Alliance on May 6th devoted its attention to this question.   It resolved to Join the Parliamentary Committee of tho Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative movement in making an exhaustive enquiry.The additional cost of ooal will increase the discontent. It would bo well worth while to issue very simple statistics, not in millions, which convey little to tho ordinary worker, to show in detail tho average cost of a ton of coal delivered at a house or factory.Tho shortage of ooal is affecting the poorer classes seriously.   Feeling is specially strong in the Manchester district, where a strike is threatened unless supplies are forthcoming.   My correspondent adds that he knows dozens of cases where families have been out of coal for weeks and havo had to tako kettles to their neighbours to be boiled.THE &quot;WORK TO RULE&quot; STRIKESo far, the strike of railwayman in the &quot;Work to Rule&quot; form has boon looal but if it continues the whole goods system may be disorganised in two or three weeks. - The fact that the passenger traffic has not beon affected tends to blindpeople/
people to the importance of what is going on.   Nevertheless,strike is not. universally popular because tho men are losing overtime pay.   A well informed correspondent in Londo says, &quot;Take it all round, the men are half-hearted and will not oarry on after this week,&quot; The present position is; &apos; london at Paddington, Nino Elms, Liverpool Street and King&apos;a Cross there is considerable congestion.Liverpool. Goods stations are greatly congested and tho docks ara affected as import goods, including foodstuffs, are hold up &quot;in transit&quot;.Manchester and SalfordSoin3 congestion, but the situation has been relieved hy tho employment of extra casual labour; the railwayinc are not at present pleased with the experiment.Loicestor and CoventryAre not yet greatly affected. PrestonStrike has commenced. Eooflfl. Bradford. Dbnoaster, Huddersfiold, Halifax and ShcffielEffect will be felt next weok if strike continues..- ^ IMonfovoarmouth Goods Station, aundorland;Very serious congestion but strike is not likely to I spread to adjoining centres at present.EdinburghStrike has commenced.North Eastern RailwayA meeting will be held at Gateshead on May 15th to heal reports of delegates on suggestion to strike one day a week.   Majority of men are not in favour.TBS AFTERMATH OF MAY DAYm....................Minim.....win mimy m*m **jwnw** -; - *&apos;* mThe extremists are not pleased at being overshadowed by the Co-operative Societies on May Day and their papers are full of recriminations.    &quot;The Call&quot; says that the Co-operators have weakened the &quot;Spirit and morale&quot; of the Labour movement.   &quot;May Day should not be a masquerade but ftsummons to battle&quot;.    The writer of the article condemns thico-operators/
Co-operators for refusing to send greetings to the Third International and reproaches them for being in &quot;tho small shopkeeper state of mind.&quot;   There are signs that tho Co-op orators will hesitate before thoy commit themselves definitely to Revolution.Tho attempt to fuso the Co-operative movement with the Trade Unions is not entirely successful.   On May 8th tho Rochdale Co-operators decided that, although a closer working arrangement might bo desirable, Party politics must not bo allowed to influence tho Co-operative movement.In Plymouth the Labour Party has failed to capture tho Co-operatives and the now Committee refuses to pay any money to tho Labour and Co-operative Representation Society,In Coventry, however, there is an open alliance and the Co-operatives aro swinging towards tho Left.THE &quot;HBKDS JOT RUSSIA&quot; movement the extremists who lead the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; movement in this country are devoting much attention to the present Polish oampaign.   In the East End, where the Workers1 Socialist -Federation has recently been working amongst the dockers, they have met with some success,.for on May 11th the &quot;stevedores end coelies employed on board the .S.S, &quot;Jolly George&quot; refused to work unices a quantity of guns and ammunition wore removed from the ship.   Tho men think they are.consigned to Poland for use against tho Bolsheviks and the Union delegate states that he will stop the sailors and firemen taking the ship out.It&apos;is reported that on May 11th the Export branch of the Bock, Wharf and Riverside and General Ytorkers1 Union unanimously passed a resolution celling on the Transport Workers&apos; federation end the Parliamentary Labour Party to take suoh action as may be necessary to prevent any ship being loaded in &amp;ny British port with munitions for Poland.The/
Tho members of the branch pledged themselves not to handle any form of munitions consigned to Poland or any other country at war with Soviet Russia.   The branch has a membership of about four thousand.As usual, where there is an opportunity for causing trouble, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is to the fore and under the tit] &quot;VULTURES GATHERING ROUND RUSSIA - COMMONS SILENCED WHILE PLOT IS RUSHED FORWARD&quot; recounted on May 11th the alleged activities of Poland, Japan, Roumania, Finland, France, America and England.The various provincial &quot;HandB off Russia&quot; Committees are taking up tho question of Poland&apos;s activity, but it is doubti if they will do more than pass resolutions.A statement has been received by tho British Socialist Party from the Eieff Workers1 Committee regarding an air bombardment on the town by the Polish Forces, which is to be published in tho &quot;Call&quot; and printed in leaflet form. 200,000 copies are to be printed and 100,000 of these will be sent to W. P. Coates at Manchester for the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committ to distribute.It is proposed to hold a demonstration next Sunday or tl following Sunday outside the Polish Legation, and to elect f) that demonstration a deputation to see the Polish Charge&quot;  affaires, and protest against the Polish offensive.   The*&apos; i        .....      , :-:y * ,: british Socialist Party is arranging tho demonstration and t! &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is supporting it and promises to undertake publicity.   The necessary police precautions will be taken.TH3 LABOUR.DELEGATION TO RUSSIAIt seoms clear, from the following radio sent out on p April 20th, that this Delegation will bo &quot;spoon-fed&quot; by th^ J Bolsheviks as other visitors to Soviet Russia.have been.&quot;The/
5347&quot;The workers of Russia send their sincerost and most oordial fraternal and Socialist greetings to the working class of Groat Britain,   Tho delegation of tho TraAe Union Congress and British Labour Party is requested to oall, during its Journey to Russia, upon Litvinov, Russian representative at Copenhagen, and Gukovsky, delegate of the Centrosoyus at Reval, in order to determine the details of the journey.   The delegation will be received at tho Russo-Esjthonian frontier by our representatives.   People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Chicherin.&quot;THS COMMUNIST PARTYThe Amsterdam Sub-Bureau of the Communist International has addressed a communication to the &quot;Communists in GreatIBritain&quot; regarding the vexed question of affiliation with the Labour Party,   The Bureau is of opinion that Communists should not be affiliated, either directly or indirectly, to political organisations that accept the principles of the Second International,   &quot;For England such an organisation no doubt is the Labour Party&quot;,It further declares that it would be bettor to postpone the formation of a Communist Party in England than to compromise such an important issue, as it &quot;Clearly sees the catastrophe which will follow the coming into ppwer of a Parliamentary Labour Government.&quot;FEELING AMONGST BX-SERVICE MENIn South Wales and in the Coventry district themembers of the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; and the NationalFederation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors, andSoldiers are greatly perturbed by the conditions under whichex-service men are living in Ireland.   The followingresolution has been passed by many branches:&quot;That this meeting of the Comrades of the Great War, being gravely concerned at the news which reaches them from .many parts of Ireland of the conditions Under which ex-service men are living, the persecution under which they are suffering, and the danger to their wives and families, calls upon the Government to take immediate steps to give protection to these men, who went without any compulsion whatever, to fight side by side with their brothers of Great Britain and Overseas.&quot;
Tho three Coventry branches of the National Union of Ex-Service Men seora likely to close down, owing to lack of support.   Tho Union is not popular locally where the ox-service men, though socialistic, despise tho members who, they say, are chiefly Boyal Army Service Corps men and&apos; conscripts who remained at home during the war,A. Hannah of the International Union of 3s-Service Men is using tho little influence ho has to oppose recruiting for the Territorials,   He claims that although recruiting for this object has been in progress for a month, only 1,000 men in Glasgow have responded, ,  ,My Yorkshire correspondent states that: the recruiting campaign has been badly received in his area end that the workers &quot;express disgust at tho mere mention of the word territorial,&quot; ... *.-Newcastle Ex-Service Men, who are unemployed, are still protesting against the employm .-nt of women in Government Departments.   The National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers are arranging to hold a big demonstration at Newcastle on 19th June, 1,920,   Pensioners declare that the amount of their pensions are entirely inadequate in comparison with the-cosj; of-living and present living conditions; resolutions to that effect have been passed by branches of the organisations of Bx-Servixje-Men in tho ::v district.       &apos;    ; &quot;T. MURPHY &apos;This man, on whom I have previously reported, was one of the British delegates (Shop Stewards and Socialist Labour Party) who attended the Communist International at Amsterdam^ February 3rd-8th;. since that date he has been touring Holland and Germa in the company .df ;an Italian-Jew Communist, called E. B. Snyderv;&quot;   - *      r&quot;&apos; - alias/
alias Fraina, who Is well known to the American Government. He is improperly in possession of a British passport. These men have reoently been detained for trying to enter Flensburg without vises and are now on their way back to England.   Murphy, in a long letter to &quot;The Socialist&quot;, 6.&apos; 5. 20., attacks the British Socialist Party for not withdrawing from the Labour Party; he says, &quot;The Communist Party must seek to destroy the Labour Party as an enemy to the proletarian revolution.&quot;In an article in the &quot;Call&quot; 6. 5. 20. (the official organ of the British Sooialist Party) Fred Willis derides Murphy for telegraphing to their head office through Colonel Malone, M.P., to secure his release.   Willis wonders why Murphy &quot;did not approach his own immaculate revolutionary organisation (Socialist Labour Party and Shop Stewards) to get him out of his difficulty.   Why did he sully his immortal soul by approaching the 1 compromising1&apos;&quot;, Opportunist&apos; &apos;reformist&apos; British Socialist Party in the matter&quot;.Willis&apos; reply (next week) to Murphy&apos;s letter in the &quot;Socialist&quot; will be interesting.My Sheffield correspondent reports that efforts are to be made to have a &quot;day out!&apos; when Murphy returns to- Sheffield. The advertisement of Murphy1s detention in the Prestf has brought him into the limelightTBURGOOB-  The &quot;Social Soviet&quot; movement which is the outcome of the recent Rank and File Convention (vide my reports 46 and 47) appears to be making some&quot;progress.   The prime mover, who, however, atoids publicity, is &quot;Joe&quot; Thurgood of Ashford. He is a boot repairer, and an avowed Bolshevist of consider-able looal influence, especially amongst postal and railway workers.  He is in touch with the leading revolutionaries invarious/
various districts who are forming &quot;Social Soviets&quot; under his guidance.   The most recent instances are Birmingham whore the &quot;constitution&quot; has been drawn up and Broadheath, Cheshire; where &quot;a good committee is at work&quot;.   These &quot;Social Soviets&quot; will doubtless form the nucleus of a Communist Party and although they are as yet in the Bkeleton stage they may extend.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; *h - - -&apos;The Committee of Trade Unionists which was formed to assist the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has recently issued an appeal in which the financial position of the paper is described. The preamble states that the paper can live and develop &quot;only through joint action by the whole movement.   This at. present is Lacking&quot;.   It is urged, tha-t the shortest out to success, a publishing centre at Manchester, entails a sum of  400,000 and that if 3,000,000 Trade Unionists made one - contribution.of 3s. tho paper would be secure.   Alternatively:    an extension in London would achieve the same,, end, by raising the circulation to 500,000.   This scheme would involve expenditure of  165,000 in the first year,  120,000 in the second and  60,000 in the third.   The actual figures, ^however, prove success to be somewhat distant; in November,:   1919, the weekly loss &quot;had fallen&quot; to  1,400.   Now there.   ls;an increase in costs of  1,450 consisting of:: - Wages .    4.50 Paper  750.,. .,vCarriage ,  1,80Other charges         70Against this must be set an increase in advertisementrevenue, due iri part probably to the anti-nationalisationcampaign, which is said to have risen from  670 in november last to  1,320 in February.   The present total weekly lossis therefore  2,200.As far as can be ascertained from the columns of the&quot;Daily/
&quot;Daily Herald&quot; the amount invested &quot;by Trade Unions since my repo:1; Kc. 43 of 86,2,18, is about  49,500; of this sum  25,000- 40j000 represents the miners&apos; levy of Is. per member.   The derations for this period amount to about  200.   The total sum realised by the campaign for  400,000 stands at present at about  78,000 of which some  300 are donations.It is significant that protest has been raised against the proposal of the Carpenters&apos; Union to invest  15,000 in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and in tho current issue of &quot;The Railway Review&quot;, a member of tho National Union of Railwayman asks on what grounds the Head Office &quot;has had the audacity to send out circular letters to the&apos;branches&quot; for funds for the paper.   He adds, &quot;Would it not &quot;be better, if the Head Office has money to give away, to build houses for the many thousands of National Union of Railwaymen members who are next door to homeless ...... I am totally opposed to a gift of this description.&quot;According to a usually trustworthy source, Mr. Lansbury has accepted  10,006 &quot;from the Khalifat Delegation in return for a &quot;promise to support&apos;ijneir cause.   From this source comes -also tho commentary, &quot;&quot;If all the various financial supporters of this paper wore to meet suddenly in one room there would be tho  evil of a scrap.&quot;A correspondent who has made careful enquiries regarding the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; sends the following report&quot;The 1 Daily, Herald is printed upon three machines, two up-to-date and one old one.   The utmost capacity of the thres machines,is 300,000 copies and the Victoria House Printing Co. Ltd* print that number dailyo   The sale amounts to 200s000 and 25,000 are given away for propaganda work.   The returns are from 20 tewhich; I am reliably informed, is a very heavy percentage for any newspaper.   The rIaily Herald1 is printed in Tudor Street, but the returns are  sent to Gough Square.&quot;It is stated that the 1 Daily Herald&apos; have reoantly captured some .of the readers of the &quot;Daily KewsT.   At one time it was expected that Mr. Asquita would declare a strong labour policy which would haveseoured/
secured for the &quot;Daily News&apos; men of the most extreme Tiews.   Mr. Asquith, however, having failed to fulfil their expectations, they have gone over to the 1 Daily Herald&apos; and become readers and supporters of this extremist organ,&quot;The &apos;Daily Herald1 travellers at one time were rather coldly reoeived by newsagents and there was no inclination on their part to help a paper bent on so much propaganda, but, to-day the &apos;l/any Herald1 travellers in London, Yorkshire, and right away up to the North, are treated most kindly because there is a demand, and an increasing one, for the paper.   Newsagents say: &apos;Business is business whether we agree or disagree with the columns of the 1Daily Herald&apos;,&quot;It is predicted that the circulation will continue to increase.   This is assisted by the very liberal allowance of returns granted by the &apos;Daily Herald&apos; in comparison with any other paper.   The staff of the &apos;Daily Herald&apos; claim that the circulation is 400,000 to 500,000 which is, of course, not the truth in view of the printing capacity of the machines which is 300,000 at a maximum.&quot;The Herald League speakers are urging their audiences to support the paper and claim that the decline in sales is due to the fact that the workers buy the &quot;Star&quot; and other journals for sporting news which is not so well covered by the &quot;Daily HeraldSupporters of the Herald League in Birmingham are very disappointed at the poor response made at the recent meetings in the Town Hall for funds.   The collections have been very poor, with the result that a debt of  13 has been left, and appeals,are now being made for donations to clear off this amount.403 reels of paper are at present lying at Wapping for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   They have been sent from Sweden, and effort are being made to trace tho origin of the consignment.The Woolwioh &quot;Pioneer&quot; lost  1,198, 6s. 7d, during 1919.   I The increasing price of paper  seems likely seriously to handicap the extremist Press. ATTEMPTS TO TAMPER WITH SOLD BBSAn attempt is being made by Harold Burgess, who is employe by Sylvia Pankhurst, to circulate Bolshevik literature among th^ Privates of the Irish Guards.   The matter is before the Director of Public Prosecutions.   Documents said to have been found upon 
the Swiss Communist, Platten, who came down in an aeroplane when attempting to make his way from Russia into Switzerland, show that it is part of the Bolshevik plans to tamper with the loyalty of the troops in Prance and England.   More than one case of such attempts have been reported during the last few days.SIM PEIfl ID? GR5AT britain during the week Sinn Peiners in the London area and-in tho provinces have been comparatively quiet; this attitude is probably due to the fear of opposition.   The recent meetings of railwayman and ex-Service men at V/ormwood Scrubs were utilised to air personal grievances, rather than to support the Irish.   There- are rumours in London of a fusion between English and Irish Labour, but this is highly improbable, in view of tho mutual antagonism between the rani: and file of the two bodies.On May 9th a Sinn Fein demonstration at Manchester was attended by at the most 1,000 Irish men and women, although the meeting had been extensively advertised. Of this number several hundreds travelled from Liverpool in the same train as my correspondent.   The speakers , included Mr. Tom Myers, H.P., Mr. Tom Snowden, Labour candidate for. Zeighloy and members of the Manchester Labour Party. , The resolution condemned British policy in Ireland, advocated self-determination and demanded the . release of prisoners and the treatment of all political offenders as First Class misdemeanants.The Australian chaplain, Father 0TDonnellf who has been speaking in various provincial towns, addressed a meeting of about 500 Irish people at Gateshead on May 6th in his usual anti-Government vein.IRELAND/
IRELANDThe state of the Provinces during tho past week shows no improvement.There is a likelihood of a more aggressive policy being started by the Sinn Feiners with attacks on the troops as well   as on the Police   In Clare and Galway agrarian outrages continue.During April, 1,500 offences of an indictable nature were reported.   There is little pretence of law and order in taster and Connaught and Sinn Fein is active in the other two provinces.About 300 vacant Police Barracks were burnt or otherwise destroyed during April, and such as hxve hitherto escaped are now being destroyed by the Sinn Fein party to prevent the possibility of their being re-opened.   After next month   it is expected that Sinn Fein will command a majority on most of the County and Rural District   Councils outside Ulster, and it is then intended to refuse to levy any rates to pay compensation awarded for the murder or injury of police or for the destruction of any Government property.On May 8th a crowd of men armed with rifles, revolvers, bombs, attacked Newtownhamilton Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks.   The police drove off their assailants after a stiff fight during which the roof of the barracks took fire and considerable damage was done.   There were no police * casualties and it is not,known if the attacking party suffered.About mid-night on the same date Cloyne Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks in County Cork were similarly attacked. After two hours or more the fire had become so extensive that it was impossible to extinguish it and the police were compelled to leave the barracks.   One constable and some of the attacking party were wounded.The oampaign against the police, as the principal agents of/
of the British Government in this country, is becoming more bitter.   In very many places they are completely ostracised; in many they experience the utmost difficulty in obtaining the ordinary necessities of life.   They are receiving numerous threatening letters,   A cowardly campaign against the families of membors of the force is now in progress.   Persons who venture to let them houses or lodgings aro intimidated and the women and children are compelled to move from place to place. Nothing is loft undone, even to attempts ,on their lives, to deter recruits from Joining the force.   The police feel that they have not been properly supported and the continuous strain of tho present state of affairs may very shortly impair their efficiency and discipline.The Sinn Feiners have received orders to create as much disorder as possible in Ulster. Humours of further activity in the way of outrages are current.The release of the hunger strikers has greatly encouraged ,the Sinn Feiners.   The following extract from &quot;Old Ireland&quot;of the current week may be taken as expressing the general opinion in Sinn Fein circles.--&quot;The effects of the Mountjoy victory are already apparent. The English Government has failed to break us and having failed in a decisive trial of strength,its nerves have gone and it&apos;e a rout ...... coercionhaving been smashed they are going to try innocent soft talk.   The whole fabric of English Government in this country is coming down with a run in a state of moral and physical collapse and with it will come the whole * fabric of England&apos;s insolent claim to interfere with this country.&quot;Outside Unionist circles in Ulster, where many considerthat the whole province should be included in the partitionscheme, there is no interest shown in the Government&apos;s home rule Bill.   In its leading article &quot;Old Ireland&quot; observes:-&quot;Our immediate object in the fight for independence is international recognition of the Republic.   We must prove to the nations of the world that we have a Republic and a Republican Government in being.&quot;There was no change in the industrial situation duringthe week.   The only May Day demonstration held was in Belfast,where/
where it was of small dimensions.   The speeches were mildand call for no comment and the speakers were of no importance.The parade arranged to have.been held at Dundalk was abandoned.
