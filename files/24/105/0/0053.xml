C.P. 1253 CABINET

FUTURE OF THE SUPPLY &amp; TRANSPORT COMMITTEE

Memorandum by Sir ? Worthington-Evans

Reference :- Conference of Ministers of May 4th, 1920.

On the 4th May, the Cabinet directed ? to succeed to the position hitherte held by Sir Eric Geddes as Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee.

Sir Eric Geddes has in the meanwhile arranged to retain responsibility in case of any strike during 14 days from the 7th May.

I now desire directions from the Cabinet regarding the future organisation.

A brief comparison between the position at the time of the railway strike and to-day will serve to bring out the matters for consideration.

At the time of the Railway strike.

There was a Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces with a large number of Troops available; these troops were distributed by War Office lorries at strategic points and their presence no doubt re-assured the orderly and checked temptation to disorder.

Motor lorries were freely commandeered in addition to the large stocks of Government lorries since dispersed.

Communication by telegram and telephone was not interrupted.

Food stores at various depots throughout the country were filled.

The Ministry of Transport had a staff, many of whom had had experience in strikes; they had office accommodation and their official work had not commenced.

Sir Eric Geddes took charge.
Tea Committees were formed j   the executive --ok&amp;irLBiT of seven of these Committees were members of tfe Transport Ministry1s staff and the office accommodation, olerioal staff and. messengers of the Tram port Ministry were used.The whole organisation was, in fact, &quot;based upon the personnel of the Transport Ministry,The present position,Sir Eric- Geddes has continued as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee to direot the organisation, relying upon 5 members of hi a staff to &quot;be responsible for important    anohes of the work.Thus, Sir Henry Maybury is responsible for road communications, and ho has appointed 85 volunteers known to him personally from among the County and Borough surveyors to be -local chiefs throughout the country.8ir eric Ge&amp;des1 staff is in f aat the Headquarters staff of the organisation,E&amp;flh Department is responsible for its own share;   thus, the Fowl Ministry is responsible for food elpply and distribution and the home Office for p!*ot^tion, bttt the Headquarters work of coordination end review is in fact done by Sir eric Geddes&apos; staff,The Headquarters work is more important to-day than at the time of the last strike.Troops are not available to the same extent.Motor lorries are fewer and the power to commandeer will soon ^apse,Food supplies are under less control. If telephone and tele graphic coimiiunication   oecome interrupted, wireless will have to be relied on,    &apos;
The law Officers advise that neither Naval-Ratings for power services, nor air Force personnel for wireless, nor soldiers for lorry driving can be used under military discipline, i.e., comraunds ior such services would not be lawful c ommanols.There are also financial difficulties *    At present the cost of emergency services are borne upon a Home Office estimate for  560,000.     I am told that the whole of this is already allocated, but constant small requirements crop up such as the travelling expenses of voluntary workers, Chairmen, etc.     The War Office desire to get rid of the expense of Transport volunteers and the question will arise of the cost of storage and upkeep of lorries now that Slouch has been sold.,The Home Office estimate for emergency services renders it impossible to prevent some publicity being given to the preparations made.Uo one can be asked to take responsibility for having the organisation in readiness unless -he has sufficient staff to supervise the work not assigned to specific departments, and to co-ordinate the general plans of the Departments-.Hitherto Sir Eric Geddes has had charge, and has used, his Transport Ministry Staff for the purpose., but he is unwilling that this staff should be so used in future. Ee wishes that his Department should only be responsible for Railway traffic arrangements.There seem to me two alternatives, either that Sir Brie Geddes should continue his work with his staff or that th-b work should be put in charge of the Home Secretary with a small headquarters staff for the purpose.
It would &quot;be logical that the Minister upon whose vote the expenditure is carried should control, and moreover the emergency arrangements are intended for the better protection of lifo and property in time of civil commotion, which is one of the primary duties of the Home Office.Power is urgently required in time of national emergency to use the Naval, Military and Air Forces on civilian duties. A draft Bill has &quot;been prepared and I recommend that it should be introduoed without delay.Pecisions are required:- &apos;(l) As to the future control of the emergency arrangements. (2) As to the introduction of the Emergency Powers Bill.(initialled)   L, W-E.2 -Jhit ehall Gardens , S .W. 1, 11th Fay, 1920,
