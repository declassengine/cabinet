.....m//T Memorandum by tho Shipping controller the Reparation Commission will, it is expected, be in a position to divide the ex-enemy ships amongst the Allies some time next jaonth, and as the division will be in proportion to looses of ships our share will be in round figures about two million tons gross.   The Reparation Commission will charge this country with the value of those ships, and it is essential that we should settle at once with the Reparation Commission the basis of the value.The value of shipping has been tending downwards for some lime, and recently it has been more and more difficult to dispose of ships,British Owners have at present enormous commitments for shipbuilding and it will interest the Government to know that while the country paid to Shipowners on their losses during the war values based in about  .2q per ton, it is estimated that Shipowners have to pay at east twice that sum to replace their losses.At present it is estimated    by the financial Officers of he Ministry that if we had to sell two million tons of ex-enemy shipping e should not be able to obtain more than about  IS per ton, and the ayment would probably have to he spread over a period of 10 years, t is most important that we should not have to pay more to the eparation Commission for these German ships than we are able to sell hem for.   The Reparation Commission have, It is understood, not ettled what value will be placed on the ships, and if we do not take ction at once we may be faced with the position that the Commission ave allocated to this country a large block of tonnage at a price *(hich we cannot possible] y obtain from our shipov/ners i with the conse-uonce that money will have to be voted by Parliament to pay for the hips, and the Government will be charged with buying the ships dear n order to sell them cheap to shipowners, in other words, subsidising he shipping industry at the public expense.
This would be a position which it would be impossible to defend, and it is therefore-recommended that the British Delegate on t )fReparation&apos; Commission should be instructed to make it clear now that this country will only pay for the ships what &apos;ch.ey will fetch, it being understood that all possible steps will      taken to secure that fail&apos; price is given a(Sgd) J,?., M ACL AY 0
