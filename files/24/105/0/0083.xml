THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HISBRITANNIC MAJESTYY&apos;S GOVERNUEMT.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Petition on &quot;Official Statistics&quot;.M.H.18.With regard to the Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of ^rade (CP. 1217) on the subject of the Petition on &quot;Official Statistics&quot;, I desire to offer the follovfing observations:-committee of statistical officers of the various Departments, provided such a Committee -were constituted in a properly defined relation to the Departments concerned and with functions and duties properly adjusted to those of the Departments to which it is related.     I have, in fact, followed this course in connection with the impending Census, the plans for which are being made on the advice of    - consultative committees of the statistical officers of all Departments interested in the Census results.     I have moreover already arranged to constitute a standing statistical Committee of representatives of Departments to advise the Registrar-General as to the current statistical output of his Department.of the Board of ^rade, or in the Memorandum which he submits, a sufficient indication as to the relation which the proposed Committee should occupy to the various Departments or as to the nature of its functions.    These appear to include a roving commission of enquiry of the widest kind (paragraph 2 of the covering memorandum;   paragraph 15 c of enclosure), though in other respects the Committee^ objects appear to be merely the exchange of information between its members.    The Committee would, however, be entirely in the air, having (for obviousI agree as to the utility of a consultativeBut I do not find in the Memorandum of the Presidentreasons)/
reasons) no definite base or source of authority in any one Department,    And while its detached position would promote its usefulness as a focus for the exchange of personal views, that position would render it too irresponsible a body to be endowed with the powers implied by its duty of enquiry, the very ir.definiteness of which would in these circumstances be, in my opinion, specially open to objection.Insofar as the Memorandum may be read,as indicating a specially close relation between the proposed committee and any one Department, the Department designated, viz:   the Treasury, does not appear to me   a wholly suitable choice.I suggest, therefore, that the subject requires further examination before assent could be given to the establishment of the proposed committee;   and I recommend that the matter should be referred to the small Committee recently appointed by the Cabinet to examine the cognate questions arising out of the Report of the Imperial Statistical Conference.Ministry of Health.G.
