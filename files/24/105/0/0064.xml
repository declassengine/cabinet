[This -Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet,   May 1920.246SECRET.FUTURE TRANSPORT POLICY.Statement by the Minister ok Transport.THE Committee will recollect that in February 1920 I submitted a Memorandum on the Future Transport Policy of the Country, which provided for railways remaining privately owned, but grouped into five or six big geographical areas; that I provided means for dealing with Labour questions on a national basis, with the avoidance of disastrous disputes between individual Companies and their employees on the ground that the individual Company could not afford to pay the wages demanded ; that I provided for the adjustment of rates on to a level designed to produce an adequate&apos; living wage for the capital of railways, with a profit-sharing arrangement as between the Government and the owners in surplus profits above that living wage, and that 1 foreshadowed a considerable measure of direction by the Government in such matters as standardisation of way, works and rolling-stock, as to the facilities to be given to the public, and otherwise.As regards light railways proper, it was proposed to place these under a separate authority altogether, but to provide against the antagonism of the main line railways by authorising the acquisition of the light railways under certain circumstances.As regards docks, I advocated the taking over of these and placing them under District Authorities of a public character. Owing to the political difficulties involved in such an arrangement, the Committee decided that it would be impossible to adopt this course, and that docks must be left if it is at all possible-in the hands of Authorities and Companies as to day.As regards canals, I advocated that the State should have power to acquire as and when it was thought desirable.The Committee provisionally endorsed my proposals, with the exception of docks, which I have explained above, but asked for further information dealing with : 1 The finance of the scheme in relation to railways.2. The rate-fixing machinery for railways, with special reference to appeals for changes in rates. 3. Powers of the Minister after amalgamations had taken place. 4. Feasibility of continuing the provisional powers over docks which the Ministrynow enjoys.5. An estimate of the money involved in taking over the canals of the country if they were all taken over.6. Light railways, with special reference to their relation to the new heavy-gauge grouped Companies and to the powers of the Minister.I have given much thought to these six questions, and have embodied my views upon them in a further Memorandum, which is attached, and which 1 invite the Committee of the Cabinet to consider.(Signed)        ERIC GEDDES.May 1, 1920.Further Memorandum ry the Minister of Transport.Finance of the Scheme.The Committee will recall that the proposal Avas to secure to the companies the level of rates capable of producing a definite net revenue based upon their pre-war figures, and that any surplus above that figure should be shared between the grouped company and the Government in steps based upon percentage increase in yield on their[3100] B
ordinary stock. The gradations suggested in the previous memorandum were 1 per cent, up to a total of 3 per cent on the ordinary capital of the group, excluding all nominal additions, which amounted to 55,500,000l. The attached Table (A) should be studied in this connection.This proposal has some disadvantages, which raise certain difficulties : 1. The proportions of ordinary capital vary between groups. The range in England and Wales is from 31 per cent. (Group IV) to 42 per cent. (Group V) of the total ordinary capital, excluding nominal additions, and the proportion for Scotland is 29 per cent.2. It is not altogether easy to arrive at a clear and exhaustive definition of ordinary capital. Some preference stocks are entitled to share pori passu, or in certain contingencies with ordinary stocks, subject to a minimum rate, and in other cases preference stocks can be exchanged at any time, if the holder elects, into ordinary stocks. Splitting of ordinary stocks into preferred or deferred holdings also causes a difficulty.3. If the proportion of ordinary capital in each group were not restricted, and if the sliding scale were still based on 1 per cent, upon that capital, it is clear that a group which started with a high proportion of ordinary capital or took steps to increase that proportion would increase the sum required to exhaust the first 1 per cent, of the scale.In other words, by virtue of an increase in its ordinary capital, a railway Company would reclaim a higher proportion of its earnings above the standard, and would postpone the operation of the sliding scale. The time when the ratio of division would change to the advantage of the Government, or when, 3 per cent, in all having been exceeded, the further ^excess could be applied in reduction of rates, would be deferred.It is eminently desirable to simplify the arrangements wherever possible, and to this end I wish to avoid complications inseparable from a consideration of capital. I suggest, therefore, we take for the basis the figures of net revenue before payment of fixed charges and the provision for general reserves is made, and say that is the figure lit is proposed to secure by means of adequate rates and charges. The profit-sharing as -suggested in the original memorandum could still be in three stages, but based on a far less controversial figure than percentage on ordinary capital, viz., percentage on net revenue. I propose that when the net income as determined is increased either by economies in working, traffic development, or any other cause, such increase up to 7 per cent, shall be divided between the Government and the Railways in the ratio of one-third to the Government and two-thirds to the group companies; the next 7 per cent, half and half; and the third 7 per cent, two-thirds to the Government and one-third to the group companies. After that point, rates, fares or other charges to be reduced..This alternative safeguards the Government against any deferment of the operation of the sliding scale through overweighting of ordinary capital, and avoids the practical difficulties of defining and limiting such capital.Obviously the figure of net income will have to be increased to compensate for capital not brought into use before the end of the base period, and similarly for new capital to be expended in the future. So far as present control is concerned these points have been dealt with under the Railway Agreement, but no attempt was made under that Agreement to deal with capital works brought into use prior to the base year but not fully developed.The groups should have freedom to rearrange the proportions of the various stocks to meet the exigencies of amalgamation, subject to the approval of the Minister of Transport.Bale-fixing Machinery, with special reference to appeals for Changes in Bates.It is not clear, either to my memory or in the minutes of the Committee, exactly what was wanted in this connection as described in the heading above. The following observations, however, may be useful: In my memorandum of the 9th February, 1920, on future transport policy, I proposed that the Act of Parliament should &quot; lay it down as a charter of the new group companies that rates and fares shall be fixed at such a level as with efficient and economical management will, in the opinion of the Minister of Transport, enable them
to earn a net income substantially equivalent on the average of some years to the pre-war net income of all the companies absorbed in the group.&quot;I further proposed that any surplus above this pre-war standard should be shared with the Government on some sliding scale basis,- and the object of the present memorandum is to develop these proposals and the machinery by which they can be made effective in more detail.The Rates Advisory Committee is now engaged upon a systematic review of railway rates and charges, and their reference will later be extended to cover fares. The Committee will consider the principles upon which rates should be fixed, the extent to which the existing classification should be revised, and what new scales of rates and charges should apply in future. As the outcome of their investigations, I hope to be able to place the whole system of rates and charges upon a satisfactory footing.The object of the revision will be to secure financial equilibrium to the railways as a whole, and, aiming at this result, the revision will, I think, secure an approximate equilibrium within each of the proposed new railway groups. It will, however, be necessary to verify in due course whether group equilibrium has in each case been established, and if the rates and charges were found to be insufficient in any given case to produce the pre-war net revenue, the Rates Advisory Committee, or whatever body might be appointed to exercise its functions, would have to consider modifications in their scheme, and make recommendations to the Minister as to-day. It should be possible to adjust rates without serious difficulty on specific and possibly local traffic.Until this rates revision has been fully considered and the present Rates Advisory Committee has reported as to the future basic principles of railway rates, it is impossible to say precisely what machinery should be set up for dealing with appeals from traders on railway rates.To-day it is the Railway and Canal Commission. This is a slow, costly and cumbersome procedure, and the law provides only for dealing with increases of railway rates, undue preference and rebates. There is no tribunal which considers claims for reductions nor which deals expeditiously and economically with railway rate difficulties as they arise. I think some such tribunals are necessary. I do not think we can forecast exactly what they should be without first settling the basic principles of the railway rate-making of the country, but the Committee wished for further information as to the appeals by railways for adjustment in rates to maintain an earning capacity not less than the average for some years before the war, or whatever base period is taken.I think that a body like the Rates Advisory Committee, advising the Minister, but working in other respects subject to him, is the right body to advise as to the means necessary to meet the obligations of the State under the proposed arrangement, but a judicial tribunal should be provided to which the railways could go for an order that the Minister should take action to meet his obligations under the new enactment we are considering, and a suitable body for this purpose, I think, would be the Railway and Canal Commission as it exists to-day or with such modifications as may be determined on hereafter. I think that traders&apos; claims against undue preference should continue to go to that body.As regards the railways&apos; claims for adjustment in rates in order to produce the necessary revenue, these claims may be brought about in lour ways: (i.) By improved wages and conditions of&apos;service under the Central Wages Boardand National Wages Board or their successors, (ii.) The price of materials, stores and other working costs generally not regulatedas in (i). (hi.) Trade depression, (iv.) Uneconomical working.As regards (i), though doubtless the railway companies will claim that every decision will require special treatment, I think there must be a limit as to the frequency of revisions, either imposed by interval of time between applications or by amount of money involved.As regards (ii), adjustments due to the general movement in costs and prices cannot be made from day to day, and I think that claims not less than quinquennially would be reasonable.With regard to (iiij, trade fluctuations come in cycles of five or seven years as a rule, and should not be met by adjustment of rates more frequently or to a greater extent than would be brought about under (ii).As regards (iv), uneconomical working should, of course, not justify increased-   [3100] v B2
charging powers, and if the State decided that a railway was working so uneconomically that an increase should be refused, it would be open-under the procedure forecast above-to the Railway Company to ask the Railway and Canal Commission to make an order, and before that tribunal the Ministry of Transport would have to make good its case of alleged uneconomical working-which, with statistics on the present lines, kit would be in a position to prove, if such were the facts.Powers of Minister after Amalgamations have taken place.As is always the case when one lays down powers which one requires to provide for, the list looks more formidable and terrifying than it would ever in practice prove to be, and I think that this will be generally admitted. I would ask my colleagues to consider the powers below, recollecting that consideration.I would also ask my colleagues to assume for the sake of this argument that I will be able to prove that British railway operating piactice owing to a variety of reasons, for some of which existing legislation is responsible; for others of which the physical and economical growth of our railways is responsible ; and for others in which the responsibility must rest upon&apos; the methods and ideals of management of British railways-is not up to the standard of efficiency of the best railway management of the world. That standard can be reached over a period of perhaps ten years, provided the necessary power is given to someone to make the railway with the lowest standard conform to the highest standard economically possible, and that that standard should he a common standard throughout, be it size of waggons, loading gauge, length of train, efficiency and capacity of plant, or otherwise.The highest standard which is necessary for the most economical transport possible, if it is to be provided in this country, can only be attained by some such central authority having the power to require its adoption throughout, and will never be attained as long as railway or dock companies are allowed to look only at their dividends and their interest to their shareholders, as they have done in the past in these respects.There is another consideration which I would like to put before my colleagues in justification for these powers of the State over railways.   The Railway Acts conferred certain benefits upon the railways, and placed certain obligations on them in return. As the railways availed themselves&apos;of their powers under the Acts, this may be called . a bargain between the nation and the railways.   Owing to the general trend of world prices, the railways have to come and ask for an increase in the charging powers.   It is therefore appropriate that the State should reply that in return, it requires certain powers over railways, particularly seeing that, in addition to giving increased charging powers, the State is prepared to provide for those charges on a basis which will be almost equivalent to guaranteeing the companies a certain revenue.   That, moreover, the State is proposing to sanction amalgamations which make lor economy in working, such amalgamations as most railways have already sought, or desired to obtain, without success.   In return for these further great advantages, the State is entitled to ask for further authority over railways in order to ensure that the public which has to pay is properly safeguarded.I realise most fully that to put such great powers as are set down below into the hands of a Minister without check of any kind might be disastrous. I would therefore provide a Railway Advisory Committee on the lines of the Rates Advisory Committee, consisting partly of the technical experts of the Ministry, partly of outsiders and partly of technical railway officers. It would be obligatory for the Minister to seek its advice before he made any order under these powers. Parliament could always require the advice to be laid before it, and that should be sufficient check thoughout of ill-considered action.I will group the proposed powers under certain heads : (a.) The State should have the right to require adequate railway services and adequate traffic facilities, including minor extensions in the geographical areas, which it is proposed to allot to each group company, provided that on appeal to the Railway and Canal Commission the group company is unable&apos;to show that it will&apos; inyulye a capital expenditure which would seriously interfere with finances. (6.) I think also that, subject to the same appeal, the State should have the right to require alterations, improvements and additions necessary for public safety.For protection of the public.
1   248(r.) In order to obtain the highest standards of common standards of permanent Jor &apos;ie. , ....    , way, rolling-stock, plant and equipment so that railway rates may be kept working ofIqw, it is necessary for the State (subject to the appeal provided for in (a)) f ^^JAho , to have the power to impose reasonably high standards upon backward country! &apos; 0companies.(d.) The State ought to have the right to require co-operative working, common user of facilities on equitable terms, the- pooling of traffic, and the revenue arising therefrom where competition is causing waste; the common user of workshop and manufacturing plant, and the common user of rolling-stock.(e.) The grant of running powers. (Note. This also comes under the head of &quot;For protection of the public&quot;)(/.) In order that the public may know and the Government may be in a position to judge of the working of railways, the Ministry should have the power to lay down the form of accounts and to require the compilation of such statistics and returns as are, in the opinion of the Government, necessary, with right of inspection.(c/.) The railways should submit for approval from time to time their proposals for I&quot; order to the raising of capital and their proposals for capital expenditure and natum^ ^ allocation between capital and revenue of major works. interestsIt is necessary, in view of the fact that the State is taking on the partnership responsibility of adjusting rates to produce a certain net expenditure, that ^1eet,ne^t gti t the State should approve, and, if necessary, have power to require, adequate and the reserves for depreciations and renewal, to be made before dividends are ^panies. issued.   This should be subject to appeal to the Railway Canal Commission.These are the principal powers with the reasons which make me think it necessary to have them. The list is not exhaustive, but may be taken as generally indicating the powers required.The Feasibility of continuing the. Provisional Powers over Bocks which the Ministry now Enjoy,I think that the continuance of the temporary powers conferred upon the Minister of Transport by the Transport Act, 1919, in connection with non-railway owned docks is feasible. I think that similar powers should be obtained over railway-owned docks, as the proposals for the Bill over railway undertakings fall far short of the present powers over non-railway owned docks, and all docks should be on the same footing.The appeal provided against the orders of the Minister should lie, not to a single arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chief Justice, but to the Railway and Canal, Commission (on a primd facie case being made out), as in the case of railways ; and in respect pf all statutory transportation undertakings the Ministry should have the right to prescribe a form of accounts and to call for such statistics as are necessary. With the exception of the powers in relation to statistics and accounts, all other powers to be exercised only after the matter had been considered by a properly constituted committee -the Docks and Harbours Advisory Committee.   -An Estimate of the Money involved in taking over the Canals of the Country.The proposal originally put forward was that, as and when it was decided for adequate reasons that canals should be taken over by the State, the State should have the power, through the Ministry of Transport, to take them over.I was asked whether this was a basis sum of money or not, supposing that eventually all the canals of the country were taken over, which proposal .1 would never advocate.The only way of arriving at the present-day value of the canals is on a revenue-earning basis, and on this, and on a twenty-years&apos; purchase, the undertakers could claim 10,000,0001 for non-railway owned- controlled canals, with, say, 3,000,0001 for nIon-controlled canals, and 1,000,0001. for railway-owned canals, making 14,000,000/. in all. But, in addition, there would be certain different obligations peculiar to each canal which it is impossible to estimate,- or, without immense labour, to obtain knowledge of, but in each case the obligations involved would form a part of the considerations which would determine the State to take over the canals or not.
Light Railways, with Special Reference to their Relation to the New Heavy-Gauge Grouped Companies, and to the Powers of the Minister.In so far as traffic for which transport facilities are required justifies the provision of standard-guage lines operating more or less under the same conditions as lines owned by the railway companies whose systems it is proposed to group, I am of opinion that the Minister should have power to insist that the railway companies should provide the lines which are necessary. But as regards light railways, by which I mean lines of much lighter construction with less onerous conditions of operation attached to them, and which should wherever possible be constructed along the verge of roads and subject to far less stringent regulations than is the case with regard to normal railways, different considerations apply.Light railways of this description should act as feeders to the heavy gauge railways, and I am of opinion that their construction and management should be in the hands of separate undertakings rather than that their control should rest with the heavy-gauge railway companies, whose tendency would be in the direction of neglecting them. In my view, the aim should be to provide a reasonable means of transport at a cost as regards construction and operation far less onerous than is the case with the heavy-gauge railways.If this means of transport is to be developed for the benefit of agriculture and other industries, the State must, I think, encourage private enterprise or local authority enterprise by money grants to assist in the construction and development of light railways throughout the country, and I believe that eventually they can be made to pay under efficient management. I advocate the policy of grouping light railway systems as far as possible as a means of securing economy in management, maintenance, repairs, &amp;c, and experience has already shown that this can be done successfully.By virtue of section 17 of the Ministry of Transport Act, the Minister is possessed of temporary powers, limited to two years from the passing of the Act, to establish light railway services of this description, but, as I have already indicated, I think the preferable course is to encourage the provision of these facilities by private enterprise or by local authorities with the assistance of grants where it is not possible to secure the establishment of an essential service without financial aid.Generally spea-king, I see no reason for distinguishing between heavy-gauge railways and light-gauge railways as to the powers which should be vested permanently in the Ministry of Transport. Indeed, the powers are probably more necessary in the case of light railways, in regard to which the State may have considerable financial interest.It should, in my view, be the policy of the Ministry to stimulate the development of light railways constructed, equipped and worked on the cheapest possible lines. It will probably be found that the present procedure through the Light Railway Commissioners, by which the powers to construct light railways are sought and granted, need not be continued, as the existing powers conferred upon the Minister by the Ministry of Transport Act seem sufficient for the purpose, and the Departments of the Ministry would be capable of carrying out all the duties that are required; for instance, the Development Department can investigate the need for a new service, the Traffic Department can examine the means of providing and working the service, the Civil Engineering Department can advise as to the best methods of construction, and so on. Local enquiries can also be held in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Ministry of Transport Act.(Initialled) E. G. VMay 1, 1920.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1920.SECRET.FUTURE TRANSPORT POLICY.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Minister of Transport.IT is essential that a decision upon the general lines of the future policy to be Urgency of adopted should be made and announced publicly at the earliest possible moment, for Settlemeat* the following, amongst other, reasons : The present control of railways expires in twelve months from August of this year, and before the expiry of that period a Bill dealing with the future of railways must have received Royal Assent. This makes the introduction of early legislation absolutely imperative.The Chairman of the Railway Companies Association has officially informed me that &quot; it is financially impracticable for the railway companies to incur further liabilities on capital account so long as the conditions which form the security on which their capital obligations are based remain in doubt.&quot;The general apprehension now prevailing results in an immediate loss of efficiency, and is delaying the urgently needed rehabilitation of service. So long as the railway companies are in doubt as to their future, they refuse, not unreasonably, to take any risks. They will strive to recover their individual pre-war strategic position so as to be prepared for the possible restoration of competition. New rolling-stock is urgently needed, but the companies hesitate tb increase their rolling-stock or to take over the privately-owned wagons, though they are fully aware of the importance of the economies that would result. Nor do the companies regard it as possible in the present uncertainty to take steps on their own initiative in the direction of unification of interest. Further, the changes in railway methods that are needed can now be introduced with much less public friction, when everything is fluid, than later on when trade has begun to settle back again to its old grooves. And, moreover, the great improvement and economy in working which the public expect and rightly expect cannot be attained until the future of our transport agencies is definitely settled.For these reasons it is very desirable that a decision as to the future policy should be come to as early as possible.Nor is it only as owners of railway undertakings that the railway companies are concerned to know in broad outline what the future transport policy of the country is to be. They are owners of a large number of docks, including several of the most important; they own a large proportion of the canal mileage of the country, including, in some cases, essential links in a chain of through navigation, the rest of which is in independent hands. They are also &quot;owners of large fleets of steamers, some of which trade as far afield as Denmark and Hamburg.Apart from the railway interest and fundamentally most important of all, it is in the interest of and due to the trades of the country that they should know what transportation system they are to be served by. We cannot hope for trade develop-ment along permanent lines unless this is known. And, finally, other owners of docks, canals, steamships, and light railways are entitled to know what the future of the railway industry is to be.I am dividing this memorandum into three parts. In the first I shall set out the main outlines of the future railway policy which I recommend for adoption, -giving the reasons which have led me to my conclusions. Secondly, I shall deal very briefly with the other transport undertakings, reserving to a later date the submission-sion of further and more detailed proposals regarding them. And thirdly, returning to the railways, I shall indicate not only the process by which I think the new system would have to be brought into operation, but the changes in the internal administration of the companies, in the relation between the companies and the Government, and in the legislation on which these relations at present rest which, as it appears to me, the adoption of the new system will entail.&apos;[2206] B
1.-RAILWAYS. *Outline of Proposed Scheme.1. Present Position.Historical Bnd       Under the Ministry of Transport Act the existing state of affairs, in which the introductory. raiiwavs are controlled, and guaranteed by the Government their net earnings of 1913, with additional payments in respect of deferred maintenance, new capital expenditure, &amp;c, terminates on the 15th August, 1921.Increases in fares, rates and charges levied under the authority of the Ministry automatically terminate eighteen months later, i.e., on the 15th February, 1923.Under the Act, therefore, if nothing is done in the meantime, the lines at present under control would revert to separate, independent and competitive ownership and operation in August, 1921, and the charging powers of the companies would cease in February, 1923, to be such as to provide for their financial solvency.It is believed that it is not possible to revert to pre-war conditions, and that, if company ownership and management is to continue, some new relationship between the State and the companies must be established on the termination of the present control. Further it is clear that, with present day costs, the companies must be given greater statutory charging powers and greater opportunities of effecting economies.2. The Pre-War Situation.Two countries only, England and the United States, ever based their railway policy on a regime of practically uncontrolled private enterprise. Both countries began by assuming that railways, like turnpikes and canals, would be public highways along which rival carriers would compete for custom. When this was seen to be impossible both countries turned to competition between rival companies, each over its own route, as the moans of securing adequate public service. Legislation to deal , with proved evils, and special Courts to enforce the lawT, gradually followed. Even before the war, it was evident that this system was breaking down, and the idea of unbridled competition was giving place to the idea of a regulated monopoly. It was gradually becoming recognised that State control had to be administrative rather than legislative and judicial. In England and the United States, public bodies here a Royal Commission, in the United States a Joint Committee of both Houses of Congress had been set up to deal with the subject. The main operative words of the two references were: in England. &quot; to enquire into the relationship between the railway companies and the State;&quot; in America, &quot;to investigate the subject of Government control and regulation, and of Government ownership.&quot;3. Effect of the War.The war, which has brought the railways of both countries into possession of the Government, has definitely put an end to. the old order. The United States Congress is at present trying to establish a basis for a permanent settlement, which it is agreed is to result in the railways being handed back to the companies on new terms and conditions. Here in England certain points have already become clear. The Government, I submit, cannot consent, nor will the raibvay staff or the public tolerate, that questions of railway wages and working conditions should in future be regarded as concerning only the workmen and their private employers. There is a general demand that the community which in the end pays the bill shall keep the ultimate control. Further, to meet the rise in costs the public have appreciated the necessity of increasing very largely the passenger fares and quite recently the goods rates. And for this reason the maxima which Parliament has imposed for the protection of the trader have been suspended under the interim powers of the Minister. There are no grounds to suppose that it will be possible to terminate this suspension within the period during which these powers continue. Again there is general agreement that competition, as it existed before the war, was wasteful, uneconomic, and in the long run not in the public interest. It did not stimulate the development of new traffic, it only added to the cost of dealing with pre-existing traffic.4. The Alternatives.Regarding, as I do, the old competitive system as dead, I suggest for the consideration of my colleagues that there are two alternatives. First, nationalisation
pure and simple, the State both owning and operating the railways; secondly, the continuation of private ownership with its obvious advantages, but eliminating the old evils of uncreative competition by amalgamations designed to create systems mainly non-competitive operating in definite geographical areas, and on a scale which would render economies possible. Each system would be concerned primarily with the development of its own district, and with the efficient operation of its system. This scheme necessitates, as does the trend of public opinion, the establishment of the ultimate authority of the Government to a greater extent than existed before the war, together with certain obligations in the direction of maintaining the earning power of the undertakings.5. Nationalisation.In reference to national ownership and operation, this much may be said; no country has ever adopted it for theoretical reasons. I believe that it has always been a question of practical policy to meet the actual necessities of the moment. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the decisive reason in Belgium and Switzerland for State railways was lest foreign capital should obtain control; in Italy, to cut the entangle-ment of badly drawn leases; in Japan to terminate concessions to companies, which prevented reductions of rates believed to be required in the public interest; in Australasia, and in early days in East Prussia, because railways were necessary and private capital would not build them; in Germany after 1870, in Russia and in North-West India, military reasons were decisive; in Canada in the last few months, because two great private companies proved unable to carry the burdens which they had been encouraged by the Government to assume. I suggest that there are no such reasons constraining us to adopt the system here. On the other hand foreign experience, I believe, supports the arguments commonly adduced here against Govern-ment management. Promotion in the service largely by seniority, and the fact that Governments do not pay the price that the best brains command in the open market, are perpetual handicaps. It appears to be a fact that no important invention or improvement in operating methods has ever emanated from a State railway. The evidence is strong that State management is more costly than private management, lacks incentive to initiative and inevitably becomes &quot; red-tapey.&quot; No democratic State seems to have escaped hitherto from the fate that &quot; politics corrupt the railway management and the railway management corrupts politics.&quot; After very full consideration of all these reasons, I am opposed to nationalisation.6. Private Ownership Coupled with Amalgamations.Theoretical arguments can no doubt be urged against such a system. It is said that Government intervention hampers private initiative; that plans and projects are drawn up by one set of officials, and then the work has to be gone over again by a second set. The company officials claim that the Government officials overstep their rights, whilst the Government officials claim that the companies are recalcitrant. But I do not think these difficulties are insuperable. If we rule out State ownership, and if, at the same time, it is agreed that greater Government control is needed, the natural line seems to be to adopt a middle course similar to, but with improve-ments on, the French and Indian systems.French and Indian conditions differ, however, from ours in one very important respect. In France, the Government is the ultimate owner of the lines, though not of the buildings or the rolling-stock; and the railways revert to the Government at the termination of the concession. In India, companies built most of the railways with capital raised on a Government guarantee. The Government, however, after a short period of some thirty years, under powers reserved in the original contracts, bought these railways, entered into possession, and then leased their operation back to the old companies. Here, the companies have built the railways with their own money. We have no reversion. And there is no reason why we should, and strong reasons why we should not, enter into possession. WTe can exercise all the powers we require without doing this, and this is a favourable time for altering the relationship between the State and the companies, as they have now to apply for an alteration in their charging powers.My recommendation is therefore that we base our future policy on the principle of a continuation of private ownership coupled with extensive amalgamations of existing undertakings. I reserve the elaboration of my proposals for the working out of the principle to Part 3 of this memorandum.
2.-0THER TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS.Light Railways.Docks.Canals.Railway.ownedSteamshipB.Having indicated the basis of the future railway policy which I propose, I now turn to the other transport undertakings, not only because they need on their own account to have a future policy laid down for them, but because, as I have said, they are involved in any settlement of the railway question.I propose that railways which are in effect &quot;Light,&quot; whether or not that is their technical position by Statute, shall not be absorbed by the great companies in whose areas they are situated, but shall be placed under an entirely separate regime. I would propose to constitute a special Light Railway Authority, and this body should, I think, with the help of expert traffic, engineering, and accounting officials, not only exercise a general control over existing light railways wherever situated, but also be charged with the consideration, organisation, and development of projects for new light railways, or other similar transport facilities, in the back-ward parts of the country.The present system of railway-owned and non-railway-owned docks competing with one another cannot be defended. The railway-owned docks have the advantage not only of having the capital resources of the companies behind them, and the power to make up in earnings on the railways for insufficient dock revenue, but also the advantage of unity of administration. The non-railway docks have to rely solely upon the charges which they can levy. The disadvantage of this system has been strikingly shown during the war, when, as the railway capital invested in docks had the benefit of the Government guarantee, the charges at the railway docks to a large extent remained unaltered, while the independent Dock Trusts had to put up their charges 50 per cent, and 100 per cent, to avoid bankruptcy. In my opinion, the dual system is indefensible and cannot last: either the railway companies must take all the docks, or they must surrender those which they now possess. The former course is practically impossible. The ports of London and Liverpool to mention only the two most prominent instances would never consent. I have come to the conclusion, therefore; that the railway companies must surrender those docks which they now possess; that all docks should be grouped in areas, broadly corres-ponding to the railway groups as delineated on the accompanying map, and that each group should be placed under the control of a District Port and Dock Commission. The District Commission should be composed of representatives of the shipping interests, of the trade of the ports and their hinterland, and of the railway company or companies serving the district, and of port labour. Each group would be constituted as a Public Trust, not working for profit, but responsible, subject to the general control of the Ministry, for the financing of its own under-taking, and empowered to levy such charges as are required to meet the interest on its capital and its working expenses, If this policy is accepted by the Cabinet, this Ministry will require to take wider powers than it at present possesses with reference to the working of, and provision of facilities for, the efficient interchange of traffic between railways, docks, and shipping; also for the allocation of charges and expenses.If the canals of this country are ever to become of real use they must be dealt with as a whole, and only the State can do this. It is, in my opinion, clear that the railway companies must relinquish most of the canals belonging to them.I am investigating this subject further, but it is my firm conviction that canals, as we know them in this country, cannot normally pay their way on tolls alone. Frontages to canals may, on the other hand, in certain cases become of considerable value, as sites for electric generating stations, new factories, and the like, and I think any future canal legislation should provide that the State should get the benefit of any value so accruing from future canal developments. On the other hand, my investiga-tions will, I have no doubt, show that some canals are not only losing money, but must continue to do so. And in these cases it may, I think, be necessary to accept the situation and abandon the canal.Railway-owned steamships vary by insensible gradations from mere ferries con-necting two railway transits, such as those between Dover and Calais or Holyhead and Kingstown, and mainly concerned with passenger traffic, through services, such as those from Southampton to Havre or Harwich to Antwerp, in which passengers and goods are of ecmal importance, to services such as those to Denmark and Hamburg, which are in effect, though intended no doubt to feed a particular railway system, ordinary trading enterprises.   I think it would be, speaking generally,
desirable that services at least of this last class should be handed over by the railway companies to ordinary private enterprise, though I would not necessarily exclude the idea that a railway company or a District Dock Commission might subsidise a steam-ship service whose maintenance was of substantial interest to its district. But this matter does not press.Hotels, real estate, road services, and other enterprises ancillary to the railway other companies&apos; undertakings will require to be dealt with on their merits. ftSKT3.-FUTURE  RAILWAY  ORGANISATIONMy proposal is that the railways should be formed into -a limited number of Grouping, groups, each occupying a definite area within which, speaking broadly, there would be no competition.  The accompanying map sets out the grouping which I propose tentatively for England and Wales. It will be seen that there are five groups formed in the main as follows : (1.) Southern, combining the South Eastern and Chatham, the Brighton, andthe South Western. (2.) Western, the present Great Western system with the Welsh lines. (3.) North Western, combining the North Western, the Midland, and theLancashire and Yorkshire. (4.) Eastern, combining the Great Northern, the Great Central, and the GreatEastern.(5.) North Eastern, the present North Eastern system.In each case the new group would absorb also the small independent lines within its area.The proposed group allocation of the systems may not be ideal geographically. Nor does it eliminate some undesirable opportunities of competition, but it has the advantage of providing for the complete absorption of all the existing companies into one or other of the groups, and at the same time avoids the dismemberment of any. At a later stage it will be open to the new group companies to exchange between themselves lines which project from the territory of one group into that of another.Besides these five main groups there would need&apos;to be, I think, a separate minor group of the local London passenger railways.Railways which it may be determined to classify as &quot;light&quot; will, as I have already said, be wholly excluded from this group arrangement. But as light railways must rely very largely for their prosperity and development upon the good-will of the main line companies in whose district they lie, it is essential that the main line companies should have no ground to fear future competition from an ambitious light railway company. It should therefore, I think, be provided that where a group railway company can prove to the Ministry that the light railway is in fact becoming an ordinary railway, or is competing for main line traffic, the group company may purchase the light railway on arbitration terms and absorb it into its own system.I propose that the railways of Scotland and Ireland should also be grouped. Scotland and From the management point oi view it would be desirable that there should be in Ireland-each of these countries only one group. In the case of Ireland, however, the opera-tion of the Home Rule Bill will decide this.This grouping should, I think, be imposed by a Statute to be presented to Procedure Parliament as early as possible. Commissioners with power to carry through the grouping, necessary combinations should be appointed by name in the Act, as was done in the case of the Metropolitan Water Board Act. I should propose, however, to leave to the railway companies themselves sufficient time to carry through the prescribed combinations by voluntary agreement, subject to the general approval of the Ministry; and I would invite them to set up a combined operating organisation for the new group at the earliest possible moment. I think the Bill should provide that, if after the expiration of (say) six months the companies have not carried through voluntary arrangements, the &quot;Commissioners should forthwith proceed to settle the terms, and simultaneously the Minister should have power to set up the necessary operating organisation for the group.The process of combination would in effect take different forms in the case of the large and the small companies respectively.   The small companies would
gnaturally be bought up outright for a fixed sum in cash or equivalent securities. The combination of important companies, as for instance of the Great Northern, Great Central, and Great Eastern, would not be so simple. Their organisations could not be abolished outright, nor their separate locomotive works and repair shops be closed; nor could any one of the three purchase outright the undertakings of the other two. The process would necessarily, at the outset at least, be one of rearrange-ment of stocks and shares, and marshalling of securities, rather than of payment of cash and issue of new securities. Boards of Each of the group railways will require a Board of Management, and I thinkManagements, twenty-one would be a suitable number. Of these, three-to be called Vice-Chairmen  should be the leading administrative officials of the group company co-opted by the rest of the Board with the approval of the Minister, and they should be whole-time officers. I propose that twelve (of whom a moiety should have large local trading interests) should be elected by the shareholders as at present, and six should be employees, elected by their fellow employees according to a scheme to be worked out later. The Chairman, in accordance with customary practice, should be elected by the whole Board.Official and employee directors should be paid the salaries and allowances attached to their posts.Kaibray The Act of Parliament should, I think, lay it down as the Charter of the newDMdendt group companies that rates and fares shall be fixed at such a level as, with efficient and economical management, will in the opinion of the Minister of Transport enable them to earn a net income^&apos; substantially equivalent, on the average of some years, to the pre-war net income of all the companies absorbed into the group.The Act should further provide that no distribution of dividend shall be made unless proper provision^ for current depreciation and obsolescence has been made. After such provision the balance of net income up to the pre-war standard shall go to the new group company.Profits beyond this standard should be dealt with in the following manner: (1.) The first 1 per cent, or part thereof should go one-third to the Governmentand two-thirds to the Company. (2.) The next 1 per cent, or part thereof should be divided equally between theGovernment and the Company. (3.) The next 1 per cent, or part thereof should go two-thirds to the Governmentand one-third to the Company.I do not suggest any division of profits beyond this point (which would correspond, though the actual figure will vary considerably from group to group, on the average to a dividend of about 7f per cent, on the ordinary stocks), as I think that profits beyond this point should not be used as dividend, but be applied to reduction of railway rates.I propose that the Government share of surplus profits should not be paid into the Exchequer, but be carried to a separate fund and applied under Treasury control and Cabinet guidance to transport development. And I suggest that it should be accepted as a principle that railways should neither contribute to, nor be. a burden * on, the general revenue.As regards rates and railway rates legislation, I think the situation arising out of the existence of statutory maxima, and the defects which are inherent in our present system of rate-making and rate disintegration are detrimental both to the trade of the country, and to the industry which serves it.I believe I am right in saying that in no country have statutory maxima been found of practical utility.The Rates Advisory Committee, established under the Ministry of Transport. Act, is now about to undertake a complete review of this subject, and I think it more than likely that in the negotiations which will follow upon the proposals embodied in this Memorandum-assuming such proposals are approved by the Cabinet-we will be pressed by both Traders and Railway Companies to provide a more flexible form of procedure for adjusting rates to meet the exigencies of the situation from all points of view. , iIt is possible that the Rates Advisory. Committee may form the nucleus of this new machinery.  Its recent report on increase of rates, which was accepted by mec* The definition of &quot; net income*&apos; and &quot; proper provision &quot; will require very careful consideration.
i   253I ask the approval of the Cabinet to the principles and main outlines of the policy as sketched in the foregoing memorandum. If that approval is given, I will then discuss the proposals with the railway companies, trade organisations, and with the men. Thereafter I will prepare and submit a draft Bill dealing with such of my proposals as require legislation before they can be carried into effect.February^, 1920.(Signed)        ERIC GEDDES.in toto and imposes an additional burden of some fifty millions a year upon the trading community, has been accepted with almost a complete absence of criticism, which I feel speaks well for the confidence with which that Committee is regarded by the public.I have already said that I do not think it- possible to leave the question of wages WageB and and working conditions to the uncontrolled discretion of the companies. I have, as condttione. the Cabinet are aware, established two Boards, by agreement, the Central Wages Board, consisting of equal numbers of managers and men, with an appeal to a National Wages Board consisting of four managers, four men and four users of railways, with an impartial Chairman. I think a scheme of this kind should be made permanent, if possible, though it is a question whether these Boards should remain attached to the Ministry of Transport, or be transferred to the Ministry of Labour.It will be necessary, I think, that this Ministry should possess in future Powers of substantially the powers which it at present possesses under the temporary pro-visions of the Ministry of Transport Act.   The Ministry should also have, amongst others, the following powers : (1.) To require each group company to afford to the others reasonable facilities for interchange of traffic, through running, loan of rolling-stock and locomotives.(2.) To order standardisation of plant, appliances, loading gauge, rolling-stock, &amp;c., (3.) To require the provision of reasonable facilities whether of physicalaccommodation or of service for the public. (4.) To call for accounts, statistics, and returns, and to require the companies to adopt a uniform system of accounting. (5.) In reference to public safety, the powers inherited from the Board ofTrade are sufficient, except that certain powers, which at present canonly be exercised at the opening of new lines, should in future be exercisable at any time thereafter. (6.) Certain powers of approval and veto as to issue of capital.I recommend that the future organisation of the Ministry of Transport should be somewhat on the following lines: At the head there will be a Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary, as at present. The whole transport organisation should be under a chief transportation officer, who should, if possible, be an expert eminent in his profession. Under him there should be officers in charge of the several branches, as at present, finance, traffic, development, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and roads. The officers should form a Board, and act subject to the control and direction of the Minister.
