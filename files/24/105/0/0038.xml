This Document io the Property of /TEE DIBiSOTORATB OF IMTifiLLiaJSKOB (Home Office)SECR2TScotland House, S.W.I.Special Report No, 175th May, 19200?H]3 RUSSIAN TRADE DJSL13GATI0N.Conversations with Kress in, Litvinoff and Illishko,I Russian banker who has just returned from Copenhagen gives the following account of his conversations with KRASSIK, LITVINOFF and ICLISHKO,   He arrived in Copenhagen early last week and on the following morning saw Eras sin for stme two hours,   Krasoin said that the Allies were generally ignorant of the situation in Russia and their real aims.   The Allies have no right to dictate who or who shall not be included in the Russian Delegation, and as to Litvinoff, he was never compromised in England as Mr, Locker Lampson was in Russia,   The banker, who was accompanied by an Englishman and whom we will describe as Mr. X,, asked whether the property of the bank confiscated by the Bolshevik Government would be restored and how the Soviet Government would regard Russians working in tho bank who were not Communists,   Krassin replied that in the Delegation there were only four Communists and thirty experts: that was a sufficient.answer.   They had no quarrel with anti-Communists if they did not put their views into action; they might come and work in Russia freely and they would not be molested for thoir opinions, but if they put their opinions into action there was no time to waste over trials: they would be shot.On the political situation Erassin had a good deal to say.   He declared that only 7$ of Russians have lost by theRevolution/
Revolution arid 93$ have gained: under the old regime fthey died from the action of the Government and the Church; now -since for ^ho present the Soviet Government intends to leave the peasants alone - the peasant a have tho &quot;best reason for welcoming the devolution.   &quot;Look,&quot; said Erassin in Russian, &quot;&quot;You think we defeated 3)enikinTs soldiers by killing them. Nothing of the kind; it was fat pork that did it; we starved ourselves in order to tempt them with food.   denikin fed his officers but left his men starving.&quot;   Ho went on to say that Brussiloff was now in the Kremlin as their military adviser and he was quite content with things as they were.On the industrial situation he explained.that they have gold in Moscow to pay for goods, but they can only dispose of it in Copenhagen at a disadvantage.   What they want to do is to open a credit in London, but.they are afraid to send the gold there for fear that it may be seized by the British Government; that is their, real difficulty,   Mr. 0&apos;Grady had arranged that payment should be made in Chinese Bonds now in the hands of the Bolsheviks, but they found that the coupons were not quoted on the Stock Exchange and so that came to nothing.Re said that they would welcome any Russian who was content to work, and even if he&apos; came there only to make money all that will hapnen to him is that he will be watched, but if he attempts to bribe Soviet officials they will waste no time with him, but shoot him out of hand.In talking of Litvinoff It was quite evident that Erassin is extremely jealous of him and does not want him to come to London.On the following day Mr. I., and his English companion had a long interview with IClishkc, who began by saying that the,negotiations/
negotiations between Mr. Wise and the Delegation have been a game of bluff on both sides.     It was no good negotiating with Mr. Wise or with Mr. Grant Watson beoause they appeared to have no powers.    All they could say was that they would refer any point at issue to London,    What they wanted was someone who had full powers to say &quot;Yes&quot;or &quot;No&quot; to any given proposition. He seemed oonvinood that the Allies were under the impression they could get far more from Russia than they could give.    Mr. X. undeouived him as to this, pointing out that British factories were full of work and had moro orders than they oould execute and that no factory was stopped for lack of raw material, whereas Russia was economically at her last gasp for lack of manufactured goods.    Xlishko appeared convinced and changed the subject.    He said that he could easily oonyince Sir Basil Thomson, if he had an interview with him, that the coming of the Delegation was fraught with no danger to this country:   they had bigger fish to fry than spreading Bolshevik propaganda, and Mr. I. gathered that one of their chief objects would be enlisting bourgeois Russians for servioe in the Soviet Government.    Mr, X, was convinced that Klishko is not a Bolsheviik at all, but is bent on making money.    Re ^repeated Krassin&apos;s views as given above, but he seemed to be far more intelligent as a diplomatist than Erassin, who was blunt almost to the point of discourtesy.,    Klishko said that the Bolsheviks had got over their most dangerous time, i.e., the winter, and they felt confident that they could   oarry on for another year as they were, but that it was vital for them to enlist in their servioe the brains of the oldintelligenzia./
intelligenzia.    He wanted to know whether Mr. X. would receive  25,000 in gold in Reval and let them draw upon it in London; the question of opening a credit for a million would depend upon the British Government givi^J) an undertaking that it would not be seized, and this would have to be discussed by their Committee.On the following morning LITVINOFP sent a request that Mr. X. and his oompanion would call upon him at onoe.    They found him in a room by himself and he would not admit Klishko to the interview as Krassin had done.    He talked for two and a half hours.    $peaking of the Russian debts to foreign countries he said that they had notified the AllieB that the debts would be repudiated if they went on with intervention; they had told Mr. Bullitt that they would recognise their debts, but in the meanjbime intervention had gone on. &quot;It is the wrong time to speak of debts when you are bombarding our Black Sea coast:   it is a matter for discussion at the Green Table, end then we will oall in the experts to assess our damages as a set off.&quot;    Mr. X. said that while this might apply to public loans it had nothing whatever to do with the seizure of private property, which was mere larceny.    Whatever happened in Russia the Russians were morally bound to restore the property of private individuals.    To this Litvinoff had no answer.On the question of his desire.to come to Sngland, he said, &quot;I never wanted to come to England; I have telegraphed several times to my Government asking them to withdraw my name, but they will not consent, beoauBe I am the only person who speaks English.&quot;       Mr. X.    f said, &quot;Klishko speaks very good English.&quot;    &quot;Yes&quot;, saidLitvinoff,/
M    Q     MLitvinoff, &quot;but Klishko is only a secretary.    I have never been compromised in England; Sir Basil Thomson has examined all ray papers; and as for propaganda, we never proposed to do that.    We are perfectly free to send propaganda from Denmark In our own way, but we do not do it,&quot;    It was quite evident to Mr. X. that Litvinoff is not on good terms with Xrassin.Mr. X. drew the following conclusions:-  The government is very weak and wants to introduce bourgeois brains.      66$ of the railways are disabled, either in permanent way or rolling stock, but they claim that the percentage is decreasing and if they can get the materials before the winter they will certainly exist for another year.    Ill three said that no array was capable of vanquishing the Red Army except the British Regular Army, for that was the only army that was properly fed.They were evidently in great fear of the Polos and very anxious to saddle the responsibility for the Polish Invasion on England and Prance.    Even Litvinoff, a Jew, seomed to share the traditional hatred of the Russians for the Poles.Mr, X. was convinced that if Litvinoff were now allowed to come the fact would be trumpeted through Russia as a great victory for the Bolsheviks.
