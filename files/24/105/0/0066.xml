HHCL03UR33, I...Copy of letter from tho Minister of Agriculture to the first uoipma.301oner ofITorjcs.MIHISTB-T OP AGRIOULTURi) *-ffigHBRDSS, 4, Whitehall Placo, S.W.1. 16th April, 1920.My dear Mond, &apos;The continued occupation by the Ministry of Munitions of Armament Buildings is causing such serious and increasing    &apos; &apos; embarrassment to. the-&apos; re-organisation and work of my.Ministry that I feel bound, once more,, to appeal to you in the.matter.&apos; . This building-, as you are aware, was put up originally for the express purpose of accommodating under one roof the, various -boattored offices of the ministry of Agriculture; and,, when . -the question of allocating - post-war - accommodation. was considered by the War Cabinet,, it was decided, as far baolc as July of lagt year, that the building should revert to its proper use as the Headquarters of this Department as soon a3 the evacuation by tho Ministry of Munitions could bo effected,Ever since I.assumed my present office, I have looked upon the early possession of Armament Buildings as an -.&apos;essential feature of co-ordination and control in the re-organ-&apos; ioation of this Ministry - a re-organisation which is vital te -the interests of Agriculture,, and -&quot;the need of which-i3 emphasised by the evar-increasing burden of administrative duties entrusted to us; by -parliament.It is really intolerable that this llinistry - which unlike tho Ministry of Munitions, is a permanent Department of tho State, responsible for the moot important industry in the country - should remain a day longer than necessary split up into a series of watertight compartments housod in some twenty different offices in various parts of London.   Its branchesare
arc now scattered over no fewer than eleven different buildings in ?/ea tin ins tor - apart from outlying detachments at WevJington Causeway and &apos;;; treat ham.   This state of things cannot continue without grave and increasing injury to the public service.    It is impossible to exaggerate the continual delays, irritation, misunderstandings and consequent Iosb of unity and efficiency to which it gives rise.Such drawbacks cannot be measured in money, but a careful estimate has been prepared of the economies which could be effected if Armament Buildings, which was planned for the express purpose of housing the Ministry, were devoted without further delay to its aocommodatioru    As.a result, it is anticipated that the money saving would be probably not less than  20,000 per annum.   The indirect saving, from greater ease arid efficiency of administration, it is   impossible to estimate;   or the public importance of removing from the Board and the great industry which it  .   . represents the continual reproach, of being housed in such a disgraceful manner, ;I quite realise your difficulties in this matter, but I am sure you will also realise mine.     We want to get to work, end this question, of accommodation is blockings; us at every turno     I feel, . therefore, that I must ask you;.-to be good enough to name a,definite date by which we may --expect to obtain possession of Armament Buildings, so that we may know where we stand and make our preparations accordingly, &apos; , &apos;I shall be grateful for an early, and; I trust a favourable, reply to this appeal.Yours sincerely, &apos;      - &quot;    :;.

Thisacertainly will not be the.case for.at least/twelve month, and it may te-ce considerably longer.      As you knew,, many, millions of money are involved and the successip  o.ur efforts le of the greatest importance to the Treasury. . I feel very strongly that a move at the present time would be disastrous.I am sure that in the. circumstances you will feel it is in the best interests of the country to make no change. : .Yours sincerely, .
