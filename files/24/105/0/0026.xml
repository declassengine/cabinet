But the total imported meat consumption for the , same period estimated by the Ministry of Pcod0 if tho rate of total consumption remains as at present3 and the supply of hone-killed moat follows expectations based on last yearns ex )erioncej will bo 205.GOO tons    &apos;l!he Board(&apos;HIS D OlLlSlH!

of Trade are unable to give accurate figures shoeing how -much of tiiG 456,501 tons oi O-overament moat is likely to arrive, hero by the 30th Junot but it would appear certain that more -than tho capacity of tho cold storage available will accumulate, causing further serious blockage of the docks and river *I am told that demurrage has cost  1,000,000 and is continuing at .t3,000 a &amp;aydOf tho 456,501 tons of Government meat, tho Board of (Trade estimate that 366,689 tons are Mutton and Lamb, which are 90,000 tons in excess of the ; ritish consumption of imported mutton and lamb in tho year ending June 1914. 3.     I am satisfied that the arrangement under which the Ministry oi loo6. are responsible for the control of supply of homo-killed moat, and a general review of the consumption of all forms oi meat in this country, and the control ox cold storage, but the Board of 1&apos;rade are responsible for tho.arrangements for the imported meat, is not a good allocation of duties, and I recommend that all arrangements in connection with imported meat, including sales, should be transferred to the ministry of Food,4.     IPour proposals have teen made to reduce surplus supplies(l)   Restriction of the slaughter of home-grown cattle *   This course was considered and rejected at the .conference of . ministers on the 31st March, mainly on the ground that the Minister of agriculture considered, that such a course would bo a breach of
- 3 -faith with the British farmers, (2)     Diverting sens pare of tho supplies abroad. I have leer, unable to obtain -any reliable statistics of what has been done by tho Board of Trade in this connection, although I gather that some ships have been diverted and deliveries thereby postponed. ( 3)        To in:rrea3e homc consurnptiomIn the middle of March the price of mutton was reduced by 1-1 d. a lb,     I have endeavoured to ascertain whether this reduction had any effect on consumption. The statistics of the ibard of Trade are kept in relation to permits to sell imported meat and not in relation to actual consumption; and it is impossible to form an opinion whether or not the reduction in price did affect consumption,     Moreover,  it is not certain that tho reduction in price was passed on to tho consumer,     It may be that the butchers retained the reduction as an extra profit.The precent consumption of home-killed meat is about 10,500 tons a week-     The pro-war consumption was at about double this rate.     There is, therefore, a considerable margin of say 10,000 tons a week within which consumption might bo stimulated-.I recommend that the price of imported mutton and lamb should be lowered by 3d- a lb-  immediately and. that the reduction be publicly announced as for 3 months.I do not overlook the fact that the publics will be apt to think that the price has boon lowered because the meat is stale and. bad.  an opinion whioh. the Press have
already encouraged and are likely to foster, and that farmers may complain that their market is being spoilt by imported meat being sold below cost.The Pood Mini -try should take steps to combat this impression and they should also make arrangements which will ensure the reduction reaching the consumer.The Pood Ministry should be authorised to spend a sufficient sum in advertising the reduction in price and the reason therefor.It is possible that by this means an increased consumption of 3 - 5C00 tons a week may be achieved reducing the stock by. say, 50,000 tons, although the Ministry of Food d.&apos;j not consider that the increase will exceed 2,300 tons(4) The remaining possibility is the sale of some part4of the surplus abroad.   I ha^e caused steps to be taken which ha^o resulted in 4,000 tons of bacon being sold to Austria through the British Relief Mission and 3,000 tons of mutton h/ve been similarly sold,Negotiations which I have authorised are now pending to sell to Germany 7,000 tons of bacon not suitable for consumption in this count &apos;y, on credit, and I asked the Board of Trad   to open up negotiations for the disposal of mutton in the same manner.   The Board of Trade have in negotiation the sale to France of 3.000 tons of mutton, but even if these negotiations are successful, there will still remain a very large surplus,   I recommend that all the negotiations should be conducted by the Food Ministry and that they should be authorised to sell on the
be bt terms obtainable to austria or Germany, or elsewhere abroad, up to 10,000 tons of mutton, not lower than the reduced prices fixed for sales in Great Britain.Any sales to Germany will have to be made on credit, and while every endeavour should be made to get good commercial credits it it possible that losses will be made, but even sop there seems to be no other outlet for the surplus.The position will loquire further reviewed when reliable statistics are obtained as to the actual stocks.The reduction in price of 3d. a lb. will result in a loss, ice. a non-reccvery against vote of credit payments of  3,000,000 for every 100,000 tons   sold at the reduced price,  if, as is stated, present prices equal cost,(Initialled) !0Wt-Echitehall Gardens, &amp;sV,vI&quot;o
