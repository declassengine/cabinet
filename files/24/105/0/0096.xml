THr REALM (ACQUISITION OF LA&amp;D) BILL * memorandum by the Chancellor of thr Tflxcicqucr.1. I desire to call the attention of ray colleagues to the First Interim Report of thr Surplus Works Committee, a copy of which is circulated herewith.2.     The Commit tee recommends inter alia that certain amendments to section 13 of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) (Act, 1916, are necessary to protect the interests of Government in respect of the numerous and valuable works erected at Govern-ment expense during the war upon land belonging to railway, dock and other public undertakings; and that the proposed amend-in ents 3hould be incorporated in a draft Bill prepared by the &quot;far Office.3.     I understand that the Bill drafted by the War Office has already been before the Home Affairs committee and that it is proposed so to frame the Bill that the amendments required to carry out the recommendations of the Surplus Works Committee could not be incorporated without extending its scope and title, which it is desired for parliament reasons to avoid. 4.     it may conceivably be the case that it is more desirable to promote two Bills to amend the Act of 1916, than to include a variety of unrelated amendments ,in the existing Bill; that is a question of Parliamentary convenience upon which I offer no opinion.   I am satisfied, however, that the amendments recommended by the surplus Works Committee are of considerable and immediate importance, and ou,:;bt to be submitted to Parlia-ment without undue delay.
5,     m the absence of legislation a large number of valua-ble wrtrks and buildings erected at Government expense will automatically become the &quot;property of the owners of the land on whicb they stand with a resultant loss to the vxehequer *f several millions.6.     I should add that further measures in contemplation by the surplus Works committee, designed to effect the dis-posal of Government works and builain^s to Transport TJnder-taking a on equitable terms, are largely dependent upon the removal of the unreasonable disability created by Section 13 of the Aot of 1916, and that failure to obtain the amendment of that section will render their efforts to a large e-KCent nugatory.7. I accordingly request that facilities for the required legislation may be given.(intld.)   A..Q,Treasury, s.W. 17th Vay, 192Q,J
SURPLUS   ^ORKS   COMMITTEE, 388First Interim Report*Mr, Chamberlailt        The above Committee was constituted by Treasury 1&apos;minute dated 29th March, 1920,  (15196/20),to consider, in all its bearings, the question of the disposal of(1) surplus Railway -orks provided at Governmentexpense during the war, and (2) other surplus Government works upon land which, under Section 13 (2) (b) of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916, tho Crown is unable to retain for more than throe months after the termination of tho War without the consent., of the appropriate Government Department, and to recommend the action to be taken to effect tho disposal of these works upon equitable terms,2.        The Committee has considered the position in regard to works on land held under subsection 13 (2) (b) of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, and submits this interim Report in view of the urgency of the action which in their opinion is necessary to protect the interests of Government in respect of such &quot;:Torks.3.        In regard to the disposal of works and buildings on land/belonging to railway, dock,, canal and other public, undertakings, the Government is under the disadvantage that in consequence of the provisions of the section quoted above the Undertaking d^iing the land, which is in many cases the only possible buyer of the works and buildings, has merely to refrain/
.     , 389    irefrain from purchasing, and in that case the ranks and buildings--&apos;&apos;will automatically become its property, without payment, at theend of three months , (or an extended period not exceeding threeyears), after the termination of tho war, unless they have been previously removed, - It Is consequently being fou^d thatUndertakings are unwilling to offer reasonable prices forproperties on their land, and in the absence of the possibility*of competitive sales, the Government has no adequate moans of obtaining equitable terms.     It appears, t&apos; erofore, that under existing circumstances the properties can only be disposed of at heavy loss in comparison with their in situ values,4, The Committee has not yet been able to obtain accu-rate figures showing the original cost of construction of the works and buildings in this particular class, but they are numerous, and their present value at reasonable vatftmates must amount to several millions,5, The difficulty of effecting their disposal hasalready arisen in^cute form In the case of Grain shods at Avonmouth, Swansea, Cardiff and other ports.    These&apos; properties, involving large sums, are no longer required by Government, and the Dock Companies decline to take them over at reasonable, prices;   the only alternative to letting the Companies enter into possession ?/ithout reasonable payment appears to be the removal of the premises at heavy loss,.6, Both the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry ofMunitions have already opened negotations with the Undertakings concerned, but the results have not been such as to give hope that they will not take undue advantage of the position created by the Act of 1916,
J 390&quot;7.     It has been suggested that a possible solution wight be found by the Ministry of Transport buying the forks and buildings in question from the Disposals Board, for use by the Undertakings during the continuance of Government-oontrol, and formulating claims in respect of them against the Undertakings, q.t the end of control, under Section 3 (3) of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919,   This course could only be followed in the cse of controlled Undertakings and vrould not apply to some of the largest properties involved, such as the Grain Sheds to which reference has been made.   Furthermore, it would not necessarily be effective, as an obstructive Undertaking could avoid a claim by refusing to use the facilities during control,   The proposal has the further disadvantage that it involves transactions between two Government Departments as to the Effect of v*hich the Treasury Solicitor has some doubt, in view of the fact that a transfer from one Department to another could hardly be called a &quot;sale&quot; for the purpose of making a charge against the Undertaking,8,     The Committee hes explored the question exhaustively with a view to finding means of dealing with the situetion without fresh legislation, and has come to the conclusion that adequate means do not e xistt9,    It is considered that the bargaining position of the Undertakings is so strong that adequate powers to obtain suita-ble terms in all n,ases cannot be hoped for.   The position of the Disposals Board will be materially improved, however, if*they have power to extend the period of occupation sufficiently to enable them to remove the properties, and so prevent the undertakings entering into possession by the mere lapse of time,* t *10.    Many works, moreover, will have to be removed, andthe time given for this purpose by the Act, viz,3 months fromthe
tho torrinat ion of tho &apos;7rr, -will bo too short to enable tho necessary work to ho carried out.     If the removal in not effected within that prrlod, tho Undertaking **ill enter into possession and Gov^rhrvnt will lose even tho rosidual value *f tho materials,11.   The suggestion has been made that legislation should take the form of extending, to oo^er land belonging to public undertakings, the general powers of land acquisition at present exercised.   It is thought, however, that this power) e^en if it were possible to persuade Parliament to confer it, would be to &apos;:. large extent nugatory, the land being for the most part suitable only for transportation purposes and its ownership often essential to the Undertakings     The proposal was made in 1916 ond was ^ery strongly resisted by the Railway Companies, snd the Ministry of Transport, as the guardian of Transportation interests, is unwilling to acquiesce in powers of land purchase o^er Transport Undertakings being conferred ^ another Department e12.     As a result of this consid&quot;ration of the subject   the Committee ha-^e agreed to recommend that the provisions of Subsection 13 (2) of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act 1916 be amended so as to make it clear,(a)   that the &quot;Appropriate Government hepartment&quot; under that subsection shall when asked to authorise the retention of possession of land for more than 3 months after the termination of the War, take into - consideration from a financial point of ^iew, the effect of such retention upon the prospects of realising, to the best advantage the --value of buildings and works constructed on the land by the Government and that during the prriod of retention the Government shall, enjoy the porer of removal conferred, by Section 2 of the Act3
(b) that...it &quot;shall &quot;he- competent- for -&quot;the &quot;appropriateGovernment Department to give consent to retention for purposes other than the specific purposes for which occupation was obtained, -   It should be observed that the proposed legislation is not to abridge existing rights of tho Grown under specific agreements,13.        As subsection 13 (2.) (b) of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act now stands, the Crown may pur-chase compulsorily land which before tho commencement of the war had ceased to be used for the purposes of the Undertaking, but may not purchase land which has never been so used?The Committee accordingly recommend that the provisions of Section 13 (2) (b) of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916 be extended so that the immunity of land belonging to railway, canal, dock and other public Undertakings from oompulsory retention or acquisition by the Crown shall not extend to land which has never boon used for the purposes of the Undertaking,14,       The Committee further recommend that the same subsection be amended so as to make it clear that In the case.4 iof land acquired by the Undertaking under compulsory powers   -the &quot;purposes of the undertaking&quot; means, merely the Statutory purposes, of the Act under which the land was originally acquired by the Undertaking,In cases where the Undertaking has acquired land by agreement without any Statutory powers the compulsory powers of. retention or acquisition by the Crown should apply unless the, Undertaking can show to tho satisfaction of the appropriate Government Department that the land will be required for the purposes of the Undortaking.
thatj5.     It in reoommen^d/th^se proposed amendments to Section 13 of the Defence of the Realm. (Aoqui^lJtvloiuax&quot;&quot;Land) Act 1916 should he incorporated in the draft Bill to anend^that Act at present in course of preparation by the war Office,16.     The Committee further recommend that the Treasury should define the &quot;appropriate Department&quot; under Section 13 (2) Of the Acquisition of Larid Act 1916 for the purposes there specified, and suggest that the Ilinistry of Transpcr t should be the appropriate Department under that subsection in respect of the classes of undertaking mentioned in subsection 2 (1) of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919, &quot;iz:(a) railways;(b) light railways;(c) tramways;(d) canals, waterways, and inland navigations)(e) roads, bridges and ferries;(f) harbours, docks and piers *and also in respect of Electrical Undertakings.(Signed) &amp;.Hardman Lever* Chairman. .(Signed) E.Twentyman.Secretary,
