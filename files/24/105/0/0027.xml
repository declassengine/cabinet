Memorandum by the minister of Health.I regret that the urgent demand for labour for housing schemes should necessitate my pressing that the building programme of tne Office of &apos;.orks should be cut down even at the risk of considerable inconvenience being caused in the carrying out of some important services.The position of the housing scheme with regard to skilled labour is however a very serious one.     In some of the skilled trades the total amount of labour existing is insufficient, or barely sufficient, to meet the needs of the housing programme, even if no other building work is under-taken; and although the number of houses actually under con-struction at the present time is only a small proportion of the number which will be C02r,pleted during the coming year, shortages of skilled labour are already reported from all over the country and many schemes are progressing very slowly owing to the difficulty in obtaining the labour required.I have obtained reports from the Housing Commissioners on the probable effect of the Office of Works programme on the housing schemes in the towns in which building&apos; is proposed. In practically every case I am informed that the Government building will interfere with the local housing scheme and that a shortage of skilled labour either exists already or is expected when the full housing programme for the year is in operation..At the end of the last Session rarliament conferred upon local authorities the power of prohibiting buildings which are of less public importance for the time being thanthe/
the provision of dwelling accommodation.     Local authorities are beginning to use these powers and in some instances they have regarded the position so seriously that prohibitions have not been limited merely to the so-called luxury buildings.   It will be incumbent unon me to urse uoon local authorities the necessity for making wider use of these powers and I am, in fact, proposing that these powers should be strengthened.In view of the great need for houses and the res-restriction   of other building by local authorities in the i rite re st of house building, it is evident that public opinion, as represented both in and out of Parliament, will scrutinise very strictly any proposals for Government buildings.     I am bound therefore to press that the Government programme shall be kept within the narrowest possible limits and it should in my opinion generally be limited in accordance with the working rules as proposed by me and set out in the luemorandum of the First Commissioner.I recognise however that there may be some special cases which should be dealt with outside these rules paid I concur in the suggestion of the Pirst Co.umiissio.nor that such cases should be adjudicated upon by a Minister who is not directly interested in housing or the particular service for which buildings are proposed.C. ADDIS03.Ministry of Health,5. 5. 1920.
