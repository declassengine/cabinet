SECRET. Copy Ho .       _Monoran&amp;um &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.With reference to H*A*C* 55, Minute 1, it was agreed [decision (ill)] in view of the Treasury objection to tho inclusion of Ireland in the Bill that the natter should be further considered by ny Department and the Irish Office and that the question should be referred back to the Committee for their deals ion,     I an glad to report that an agroenont has been reached between the Treasury, Irish Office end my Department, that Ireland should be included In the Bill.    In those circumstances, there seems to be no need for the natter to be brought up again before the Home Affairs Committee, and if no objection is raised I propose introducing tho Bill at an early date,1* of i\th May, 1920.
