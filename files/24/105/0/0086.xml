These oases were, however, really survivals from a state of previous political separation and Legations were entirely separate ffcm and unconnected with Embassy.   These German states also retained foreign representatives at their capitals.  His Majesty&apos;s Minister at British Embassy Paris takes precedence as follows:  he ranks above Charge d1 Affaires but after Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiaries who are heads of missions of other countries represented at Paris.MILNER

My Government has to-day been informed by His Majesty1s Ambassador at Washington that he has been verbally notified by United States Secretary of State that United States Government can see nothing but approval of proposal for representation of Canadian interests at Washington.

Unless they hear to the contrary my Ministers will assume that&apos; announoement will be made on Friday at hour indicated above.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from tho Officer Administering the Government of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 3*5 a0mo 8th May 1920)May 7 th.    Questions which have recently been raised in your House of Commons and other public speculations regarding Canadian representation at Washington have a tendency to suggest that the Canadian Minister will be subordinate to the Ambassador.   In order to prevent misunderstanding in the future Canadian Government accordingly consider it desirable to make ole their understanding of the effect of the arrangement.It is true Canadian Minister will be next in rank to the Ambassador in the sense that in diplomatic body he will be a member of a lower class or rank; bat it is obvious that he oannot be a subordinate taking instructions from Ambassador since he will be respcnsibl to and take his instructions from &quot;the Canadian government as indicated in my telegram October 3rd and yours of October 28th the two representatives will work together through methods of consultation and constant interchange of views, and any matter which they may be unable to adjust by this method will bo referred for settlement to their respective Govonan3irbs though this it is anticipated need rarely happen-.You will have seen from Mr.Lindaayfs telegrams of April 4th and April 5th to Foreign Office that some difficulty was encountered in Washington on the questionof
of precedence dealt with in my telegram of April 1st and in previous correspondence.  You will see from my telegram of December 20th that Canadian Government accepted proposal of His Lajeaty&apos;B Government of October 26th 3s not differing in substance from Canadian proposal of October 3rd and on cle?.r understanding that the Canadian Minister should hnve precedence on same basis as Ministers of other countries resident at Washington.    My Ministers do not consider it necessary to make further representations of this to V/ashington at the moment as they do not anticipate that any real difficulty will arise in actual practice but in order that there may be no doubt should question arise in the future they do think that it would be wise that it should be stated nowc
