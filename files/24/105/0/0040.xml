Thisoperty ofjfCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.I circulate herewith to my colleagues the conclusions of the Committee which they appointed to consider the Report of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee, with the following explanation of our proposals : Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee was appointed (with my approval) by the Government of India, and submitted their Report to the Government of India. Procedure in India requires that when a Committee makes a report to the Government of India, the orders issued on the report take the form of a Resolution issued in the official Gazette by the Governor-General in Council. The Government of India have forwarded to me the draft of their proposed Resolution, which we have considered. In our opinion it is not, as a whole, a very satisfactory document, and, in particular, it does not deal adequately with the important, points dealt with in our conclusions attached. We have considered the steps to be taken to reconcile the draft with our conclusions (which I hope will now be adopted as the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government).There seemed to us two alternatives (i) To ask the Government of India to embody in their Resolution, in place of certain passages, the substance of our conclusions, and to authorise them to announce their resolution as having the general approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(ii) To furnish the Government of India by telegram with the completetext of our conclusions (assuming they receive the approval of my colleagues), and to ask them to set them out in the fore-front of their Resolution as a pronouncement by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Government of India then proceeding to deal with any other matters not covered by our pronouncement which they think require treatment by the Government of India.We decided that the second alternative was the better, and as time is of great importance I have telegraphed provisionally to the Government of India instructions as to the proposed procedure and the text of these conclu-sions, adding, of course, that these were subject to confirmation or modifi-cation by the Cabinet as a whole. And I have asked them to telegraph to me the consequential modifications they propose in their draft with a view to simultaneous publication in India and this country of the completed document, along with Lord Hunter&apos;s Report, at the earliest possible date. I hope this date may be about the end of next week.E. S. M.6th. May 1920.10   1460     100  5.20
Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.INDIAN DISORDERS COMMITTEE.CONCLUSIONS.General.The Report of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee presents the results of a prolonged and patient investigation. Their labours would be of little value it&apos; their very complete and careful findings are not put to a practical use. The conclusions here recorded have been inspired in the main by the belief that the chief duty which lies upon His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India in utilising the Report is not primarily to appor-tion blame to individuals for what has been done amiss, or to visit penalties upon them, but rather to prevent the recurrence in the future of occasion for blame or regret should unfortunate circumstances ever produce again a situation such as that which occurred in India in the spring of 1919.1. -The Conduct of Brigadier-General Dyer at Amritsar on 13th April.The main features of the occurrence at Jallianwalla Bagh in Amritsar city on the afternoon of the 13th April 1919 are well known. They are set out at length in Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee&apos;s Report, and appear in minute detail in the evidence, both written and oral, given before the Committee by Brigadier-General Dyer himself, the full and authorised text of which is now available to the public. As to the facts there is no doubt and no dispute, and it is only necessary here to recapitulate them very briefly in their baldest form. On the morning of the loth April, Brigadier-General Dyer, who had arrived at Amritsar on the night of the 11th, issued a proclamation forbidding inter alia processions to parade in or outside tho city and declaring that &quot; any such procession or gathering of four men will be &quot; looked upon and treated as an unlawful assembly and .&quot; dispersed by force of arms, if necessary.&quot; This&apos; proclamation was read out at various places in the city, in the course of the progress through the streets of u column of troops led by the Brigadier-General person-ally, who left his quarters about 9 a.m. for this pur-pose and returned to them about 1.30 pan. About an hour before his return to his quarters in Rain Bagh, Brigadier-General - -Dyer had-;heard. that, despite his proclamation, it was intended to hold a large meeting, at the Jallianwalla Bagh at 4.30 that afternoon, and at 1 p.m, he received a message that a crowd of about 1,000 had already assembled there. Shortly after I- p.m. Brigadier-General Dyer marched   from   the   Ram   Bagh   wjth   picketingJO   1421      100   5,20 a
parties (as he had previously determined to picket the main gates oI&apos; the city) and with a special party con-sisting of 50 Indian Infantry armed with rifles, -JO Indian Infantry armed only with &quot; kukris&quot; (short&apos;swords), and two armoured cars, lie proceeded straight to the dallianwalla Hagh, dropping his picketing parties en route, and on arrival marched his infantry through a narrow Jane into the Bagh and deployed them immediately to right ami left of the entrance. The armoured ears lie left outside, as the lane was too narrow to admit them. Having deployed his troops, Brigadier-General Dyer at once gave orders to open lire and continued a controlled lire on the dense crowd facing him in the enclosure (which he estimated at about o,000 persons) for some ten minutes, until his ammuni-tion supply was at the point of exhaustion. 1,650 rounds of &apos;303 Mark VI. ammunition were fired. The fatal casualties as the result of this action are believed to be o79; the number of wounded has not been exactly ascertained, but is estimated by Lord ilunter&apos;s Com-mittee at possibly three times the number of deaths. Immediately after giving orders to cease fire, Brigadier-General Dyer marched his troops back to the Ham Bagh. The reasons given by General Dyer for the severity and duration of his lire are stated as follows in his written statement furnished to the General Staff (16th Indian Division) and subsequently laid before Lord Himter&apos;s Committee : -&quot; We cannot be very brave unless we be possessed of a greater fear. I had considered the matter from every point of view. My duty and my military instincts told me to fire. My conscience was also clear on that point. What faced me was what on the morrow would be the Dunda Fan).&quot;J fired and continued to lire until the crowd dispersed, and I consider this is the least amount of firing which would produce the necessary moral and widespread effect it was my duty to produce if 1. was to justify my action. If more troops had been at hand the casualties would have been greater in proportion. //, was no longer a question of merely dispersing ike crowd, but one of producing a sufficient moral effect, from a military point of view, not only on. those who were present, but more specially throughout the Punjab. There could be no question of undue severity.&quot;The principles which have consistently governed the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in directing the nature, and the methods employed in the course, of military &quot;operations against a foreign enemy, may be broadly stated as the employment of no more force and destruction of life than is necessary for the purpose of forcing the enemy to subdue himself to the Military Commanders will. This principle lias governed their policy still more rigidly when military action against enemy non-combatants is concerned ; a fortiori it is, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined that it shall remain, the primary factor of policy whenever circumstances unfortunately necessitate the suppression of civil disorder by military force within the British Empire.
It must regret fully, but without the possibility of doubt, be concluded that Brigadier-General Dyer&apos;.transaction at the Jallianwalla Bagh was in complete violation of this principle. The task which confronted him was to disperse, by force if necessary, a large but apparently unarmed assembly, which had gathered in defiance of his orders, It is possible that, considering the strength of the military force at his disposal, the size of the crowd, and the general temper and attitude of the inhabitants of the city, he would have found -it impossible to achieve this task effectively and com-pletely, without some firing and without causing some loss of life. But it is certain that lie made no attempt to ascertain the minimum amount of force which he was compelled to employ, that the force which he actually employed was greatly in excess of that required to achieve the dispersal of the crowd, and that it resulted in lamentable and unnecessary loss of life and suffering. But this is not a full statement of Brigadier-General I)yer&apos;s error. There can be no doubt that large-numbers of people in the assembly, many of whom were visitors to the city from surrounding villages, were ignorant of the existence of his proclamation and the danger which they ran by attending the gathering. The proclamation was published in only a portion of the city, that portion being some distance from the scene of the meeting, and no warning of any kind was given before lire was opened. It would be unfair, considering the state of the city, the heat of the weather, and the strain to which the troops under General Dyer&apos;s command had been subjected since their arrival in the city, to lay too great stress upou the first point, but the omission to give warning before lire was opened is inexcusable. Further, that Brigadier-General Dyer should have taken no steps to see that some attempt was made to give medical assistance to the dying and wounded was an omission from his obvious duty. But the gravest feature of the case against Brigadier-General Dyer is his avowed conception of his duty in the circumstances which confronted him.His Majesty&apos;s Government repudiate emphatically the doctrine of &quot; frightfulness &quot; upon which Brigadier-General Dyer based his action action which to judge from his own statement, might have taken an even more drastic form had he had a larger force at his disposal and had a physical accident not prevented him from using his armoured cars. They have not over-looked the extreme gravity of the situation as it presented itself to the authorities in India generally, and to Brigadier-General Dyer in particular, on the 13th April, nor have they failed to appreciate the immensity of the responsibility which Brigadier-General Dyer felt and rightly felt to be imposed upon himself by that situation. They think it is possible that the danger to the lives of Europeans and to the safety of British and Indian troops was greater than appears from the Committee&apos;s report. In Amritsar itself violence, murder, and arson of the most savage description had occurred three days previously, and the city was still practically in possession of the mob. From the surrounding countryside reports were hourly
&quot;being received of similar violent outbreaks and attacks upon communications, and the deficiencies in these reports (duo to the success of attacks on communications) were supplemented by rumours which there was little moans of verifying and as little ground for disbelieving, In discharging this responsibility with the small force at his disposal, Brigadier-General Dyer naturally could not dismiss from his mind conditions in the Punjab generally, and he was entitled to lay his plans with reference to those conditions. But he was not entitled to select for condign punishment an unarmed crowd, which,, when he inflicted that punishment, had committed no act of violence, had made no attempt to oppose him bv force, and many members of which must have been unaware that they were disobeying his commands.in passing judgment, upon Brigadier-General Dyer for his action on the 13th April, it is impossible to disregard an order which he passed some six days later, and which has become generally known as the &quot; crawling order.&quot; It is unnecessary here to repeat tin4 nature of tl/is order or the circumstances out of which it-arose. Had the order been carried out as a punishment upon persons actually guilty of the crime, which it was designed to stigmatise, it would have been difficult to defend ; inflicted, as it was upon persons who had no connection with that crime, with the object of impressing upon the public of Amritsar through the humiliation of those persons the enormity of the crime committed by certain individuals of that public, the order offended against every canon of civilised government,&quot;That Brigadier-General l)yer&apos;s displayed honesty of purpose and unflinching adherence to his conception of his duty cannot for a moment be questioned. But his conception of his duty in the circumstances in which he was placed was so fundamentally at variance with that which His Majesty V Government have a right to expect and a duty to enforce from officers who hold His Majesty s commission,&apos;that it is impossible to regard him as fitted to remain entrusted with the responsi-bilities which his rank and position impose upon him. The Commander-in-Chief should be instructed to remove Brigadier-General Dyer from his employment and to direct him to retire.Upon a Military Commander administering martial law in a hostile country there lies a grave responsi-bility : when lie is compelled to exercise this responsi-bility over a population which owes allegiance and looks for protection to the Government which he himself is serving, this burden is immeasurably enhanced. It would be prejudicial to the public safety, with the preservation of which he is charged, to fetter his freedom of judgment or of action either by the pre-scription of rigid rules before the event or by over-censorious criticism when the crisis is past, A situation which is essentially military must be dealt with in the light of military considerations, which postulate breadth of view and due appreciation of all possible contin-gencies. But there are certain standards of conduct which no civilised Government can with impunity neglect, and which Ills Majestys Government are determined to uphold ; subject to the due observance
1   182[The foregoing remarks represent the Connnittee&apos;s final conclusion after what they trust has been an exhaustive examination of the many considerations, direct and indirect, which arise out of or bear upon the matter. They have deliberately recommended removal from employment coupled with an order to retire (they regard the combination as important) in preference to dismissal, which would involve forfeiture of pensionary and family-pensionary rights and pro-bably also of medals and decorations. * They are clearly of opinion that Government should not institute criminal proceedings against General Dyer, but that it should take on the contrary any step that is possible (short of special ad hoc legislation) to frustrate such proceedings if instituted either in India or the United Kingdom by private agency. Should such a prosecu-tion be instituted, and should it result (as they anticipate that it would) in acquittal, this would afford in their view of the matter, as stated above, no un-answerable ground for a demand for reinstatement, and this contingency may be awaited with equanimity. There is no means of preventing the institution of civil suits for damages, nor of frustrating them if instituted.]2.--The justification for declaring Martial Law and for the delay in revoking it.There are no grounds for questioning tile decision of the majority of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee that the declaration of martial law and the partial supersession of ordinary tribunals in the districts of the Punjab in - which martial law was applied were justified (chapter XL, para. 17). As regards the dates to which it was prolonged, it is obvious that the institution of martial law involves the responsibility of deciding when it is to be revoked. The general principle is clear that martial law shoulfl remain in force no longer than public safety demands, but beyond this there are no hard and fast criteria which can govern this decision, and a retrospective judgment in the light of after events is not permissible. The fact that open disorder had ceased some time before martial law was revoked may have been due to the existence of martial law, and its earlier abrogation might have been followed by a recrudescence. Looking back in the light of events, it is permissible to argue that an earlier abrogation was possible.   But it is not1421 J3of these standards, an officer administering martial law must, and will, remain free to carry out the task imposed upon him in the manner which his judgment dictates to him as best and most effective, and may rely upon the unqualified support of his superiors when his task has been accomplished.
permissible to condemn the authorities responsible for the decisions taken, who had to rely only on their anticipation of the future.3. The justification for Ordinance IV. of 1919 giving Martial Law Commissions jurisdiction to try any offence com-mitted on or after the 30th March.The legality of this Ordinance is not a point at issue: that question has been recently determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Nor is there any valid reason to question the propriety, when (as was the case here) it can legally be done, of antedating the effect of an enactment setting up special martial law tribunals and procedure, so as to bring within their jurisdiction persons charged with overt acts of violence, which were the immediate cause of and justification for the declaration of martial law. The original Ordinance setting up martial law commissions in&apos;the Lahore and Amritsar districts gave the commis-sions jurisdiction to try offences committed on or after the loth April. Had this date remained unamended, it would have been impossible to try by commission persons charged with actual participation in the murders, incendiarism and destruction of property which occurred on the 10th April at Amritsar, or persons charged with participation in the riots at Lahore on the 10th, 11th and 12th April, and in the murders at Kasur on the .12th April ; and if the Govern-ment of India, with the legal power at their disposal, had neglected to correct the anomaly to this extent, they would have omitted an obvious and necessary step towards the rapid restoration of normal conditions. But the use of the power which the Ordinance gave in order to apply the special martial law method of trial to persons whose offence consisted in newspaper articles and speeches which were not demonstrably and immediately the cause of the outbreak of open disorder, stands on an entirely different footing, and the terms &quot;unfortunate &quot;and &quot;imprudent&quot; which the majority of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee applied to this policy are at all events no exaggerated criticism.Taking into consideration the lessons of the past, His Majesty&apos;s Government can feel little doubt that, having regard to the use made of Ordinance IV. of 1019, the date&apos; chosen for the earliest limit of its applicability was too early, that the terms of the Ordinance itself were too wide, and that the drafting of any future ordinance of a similar kind should ensure due limits to its application.4.-Administration of Martial Law.There is one question with regard to which it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Majority of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee have failed to express them-selves in the terms which, unfortunately; the facts not only justify but necessitate. In paras. 16 to 25 of Chapter XII. of their Report,- the Majority have dealt
with the &quot; intensive &quot; form generally which martial law assume!I, and with certain specified instances of undue severity and of improper punishments or orders.   It is unnecessary to recapitulate the instances which the Com-mittee have enumerated in detail in both their Reports, nor would any useful purpose be served by attempting to assess, with a view to penalties, the culpability of individual officers who were responsible for these orders, but whose conduct in other respects may have been free from blame or actually commendable.   But the Local Government should be asked  to convey strong dis-approval of these orders and punishments to those who were responsible for them, and it must be recorded that the instances cited by the Committee give justifiable ground for the assertion that the administration of martial law in the Punjab was marred by a spirit which  prompted-not generally,   but   unfortunately not uncommonly   the enforcement of punishments and orders calculated, if not intended, to humiliate Indians as a race, to cause unwarranted inconvenience amounting on occasions  to injustice, and  to flout standards of   propriety and   humanity, which   the inhabitants, not only of India in particular, but of the civilised world in genera], have a right to demand of those set in authority over them.   In an earlier para-graph judgment has been passed upon the conduct of General Dyer at Amritsar.  it is difficult to differentiate, except in degree, the culpability of his conduct and that of the other officers which necessitated this feature of the Committee^ Report; indeed, the blame attribut-able to their action, in so far as it cannot claim extenuation from the need of suppressing continued and open disorder or of preventing imminent reciu-descence of disorder, is the greater.   It is a matter for the deepest regret that there should have been officers, both civil  and military, a\1io administered  martial law, not as men compelled reluctantly to deal sternly with those who had disturbed the peace of a population, owing allegiance to the King-Emperor and in the main profoundly loyal to that allegiance, but in the spirit of an Army of Occupation in a hostile country.   It is difficult to believe that this spirit would not have been checked had the civil authority given Jess cause for the impression that with the advent of martial law civil control  over   and   responsibility  for   administrative methods had largely, if not entirely, ceased.   It is of paramount importance,  if in  the future it should unfortunately be necessary in India to have recourse to martial law, that a system should be devised which will prevent the recurrence of such a situation.A review of the methods and results of trials by the summary procedure of martial law tribunals would be uncalled for. It is not, however, improper, to observe that marked attention has been directed to its disadvantages, and to the extreme divergence between sentences required by the charges as presented to those courts and by the dictates of justice as they presented themselves to the reviewing authorities. It is to be-hoped that, as the result of the experience thus gained,, means will be devised whereby martial law tribunals can be improved if they have again to be employed.1421 , c
5-The use of Bombing Aeroplanes at Gujranwala.Careful  consideration  lias  been  given  to the opinion of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee as to the justi-fieation    for    using   bomb-carrying   aeroplanes  at Giijronwala on the 14th April, and there is no reason to differ from the conclusion which the Majority have adopted in para. -.5 of their Report.   As a general rule, although for purposes of reconnaissance and communication the value of aircraft cannot be over-estimated, there can be no doubt that at the present stage of their development as weapons of offence, bomb-carrying aeroplanes ought not to be used in the suppression   of  civil   disorder except   against districts or areas which, after due proclamation or warning of intention to use them, are or must be assumed by reason of the action of their inhabitants to be belligerent as a whole.   But emergencies may occur when, owing to distances, or damage to com-munications, or both, and the progress of murderous mob violence and arson which there is no other means of checking, exceptions from this general position are not&apos; only justified but necessary.   Such an emergency clearly existed at Gujrahwala on the date in question. Although it is impossible to guarantee by general or special instructions that machine-guns or bombs will affect only crowds which would be justifiably fired upon if troops were available on the ground, the em-ploymeht of armed aircraft in such emergencies should be resorted to in future only as the result of explicit orders in writing  given by a civil authority for a limited amount of bombing and machine-gun lire to be employed to overawe mobs, which are, so far as tlie airman can judge, actually engaged in crimes of violence.   Even then actual attack should be preceded and, if possible, avoided by demonstrations of bomb-dropping and of its effects in the neighbourhood.   The Government will see to it that instructions on these lines,are issued as soon as possible.6.-Sir M. 0&apos;Dwyer.: With the general question of Sir Michael 0&apos;i)wyer&apos;s administration of the Punjab during his six years&apos; tenure of office, this is not the place to deal. The main task which confronted him throughout this period was the preservation of order in a province where conspiracy,, the activity of enemy agents, the rise in the cost of living, and the necessity of furnishing the bulk of the vast numbers of recruits to the Indian Army which the-needs of the Empire required, caused constant anxiety, but were fortunately powerless to disturb the loyalty of the province as a whole.&apos; On the one hand, there is no doubt that there has been engendered a widespread belief that the Punjab Government was hostile to the educated, classes, and was determined to suppress not only illegitimate, but also legitimate and constitutional, political agitation ; and it has been contended that repressive methods in
the Punjab were the main cause of the outbreak of April 191.9. On the other hand tributes have been widely paid to the energy and courage which Sir Michael 0&apos;.Dwyei: displayed, not only during the dangerous disorder which marked its close, but throughout his long connection with India. History alone can pronounce verdicts on these views.It must, however, be added, with reference to findings expressed in previous paragraphs, in the first place, that it follows from the view which has been recorded of Brigadier-General Dyer&apos;s action at Jallian-wala Bagh, that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot endorse the unqualified approval which Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer accorded, on insufficient information, to that action, and that it is unfortunate that he did not adhere at the time to his first impulse to withhold both praise and blame on a matter with which, as a civil officer, he was not in the circumstances directly concerned. The motives which evidently prompted him to adopt another attitude, and to maintain that attitude subse-quently, and in the light of fuller knowledge, are less open to criticism.Secondly, the opinion already expressed on the application of martial law procedure to certain trials must be taken as applying to Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer personally, in so far as he was personally responsible for the action in question. Finally, reference has been made to the unfortunate results which ensued on an over-complete surrender of control and responsibility by the civil to the military authorities in the administration of martial law. For this Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwver cannot, be held to account, as he had evidently contemplated arrangements by which civil officers would be accorded a recognised position as advisers on, if not in control of, military administration, and the Martial Law Manual which the Government of India have under consideration should ensure that in future this plan is brought into effect.6th May 1919.
