J319THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERRMfc-JDISCHARGES AT WOOLWICH;Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and the Parliamentary and Financial Seorotary ei&apos; the&quot;Ministry of Munitions.SECRETCTF.T277. le   Introductory,In accordance with Mr. Bonar Law!s wish we held a meeting at the Ministry of Labour at 11.0 a.m. on Monday May 10th,1920 to discuss the discharge of men employed at WoolwicTu   We had before us a memorandum by the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Munitions, shewing that as a consequence principally of the reduction of a War Office order given before the   Armistice, for 18 pounder equipments, it will be necessary in the near future to discharge some 600 men from Woolwich.   These men are not ex-service men, but were employed at Woolwich during the War.The reference to us was to explore the question whether by any means It would be possible to refrain frsm making theso 500 dischargeso2 o   General.There are two main facts which govern the general position viz:.&quot;1,   That by a decision of the War Cabinet dated January 8th 1919   (War Cabinet 514-Min.5.), it had been laid down &quot;That the State will not compete with private enterprise in the manufacture of articles of general trade&quot;02.   That on June 1st, 1920, Woolwich will have been trans ferred from the Ministry of Munitions to the War Office *   The Ministry of Munitions cannot therefore initiate any,-new policy in regard to discharges or otherwise03.   Alternative Work.Within the limits laid down by the War Cabinet decisionquo bed.-a   * *
quoted above, efforts have been made to provide alternative worl-for men formerly employed in the manufacture of munitions at Woolwich, and, although the field is practically restricted to articles required by Government Departments, considerable success has attended   thes efforts.   At the present time V&apos;oolwich is employed in making the following articles:-locomotive (10^), railway wagons (2,500), war Medals, copper bronze blanks for coinage, articles used by the General post Office, and a number of small orders by other Government Departments *It is not possible to spread this work over k larger number of men than those already employed in it (so as to absorb the 500 men threatened with discharge), because the work does not lend itself to expansion, and there does not appear to be much hope of securing further Government orders which might be used to prevent the discharges.   7e are convinced that everything possible has been done, within the limits laid down last year by the r&apos;ar Cabinet to Provide alternative work at Woolwich.4* Prawing Plant.In this connection we desire to draw attention to certain matters -which, though outside our reference, have a bearing on the situation.   We understand that the Ministry of Munitions have prepared a scheme and estimates for the Installation of a wire drawing plant and rolling mill at Woolwich Arsenal.   If the plant be installed it will be practicable to undertake work for the General Post Office, and for other Departments, and for Colonial Governments, and would employ a considerable number of men.   Ve desire to recommend very strongly that the War Office should examine the proposals of the Ministry of Munitions with the greatest diligence, and should give effect to them at once, if possible0This would not, however, alter the position of the 500 men T;irho are to be discharged in consequence of the reduction in the gun programme *L...... i -    &apos; -;^g*wiiiwwtk^
5. The Restriction of work at Woolwich to Articles required by Gover nment Departments BProm the foregoing paragraphs it will be seen that fJorem-merit contracts are not sufficient to maintain the 500 men in question at work;   it Is moreover highly probable that still further discharges will have to be made in the near future a   If therefore, it is desired to prevent these particular discharges and other nr-re distant ones, it will be necessary for the Cabinet to review the dealsion which prevents Woolwich being used. oil the manufacture of ordinary commercial articles.   It appears that if the prohibition of such Mork is removed, engineering firms would probably be glad to pass orders to Woolwich for certain lines of manufacture involved in their contracts which could not otherwise be completed within a reasonable time.   We do not think that such a course could properly be described in present circumstances as Government competition with private enterprise, because engineering firms are quite unable to deal with the orders coming to them, and there is no real competition between engineering firms at present.   It must, however, be real&quot; Ised that even if Woolwich Is allowed to manufacture articles of general trade, It would take some little time for the effects of the new policy to be felt.   Of the 500 men shortly to be dis-charged, 140 have received notices   hioh expire on May 22nd, Nothing can be done to retain these men, as we cannot recommend that they should be retained on unproductive work. The remainder of the 500 men are due to leave Woolwich during the month ending June 22nd.6.      Re c ommend at i ons.We therefore make the following, recommendations:-1.    That the War Office should examine the proposals made to them by the Ministry of Munitions for the establishment of a wire-drawing plant at Woolwich, and should give effect to these at the earliest possible moment.
 .      That the Cabinet should consider, at an early date, whether having regard to the desirability of preventing further discharges from Woolwich, it would not be well to withdraw the embargo on the manufacture at Woolwich of general articles of trade, so that Woolwich may be placed in a position to act as sub-contractors to engineering firms, on a declaration from the latter that they cannot otherwise execute the order within a reasonable time.ToJ0 MiiCjMMAilk.
