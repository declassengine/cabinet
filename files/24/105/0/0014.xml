[This Document u the Property of His Britannic Mhyestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,(11533) Foreign Office.China/006.1214MEMORANDUMonDISBANDMENT OF ARMIES IN CHINA.THE most important of the conditions which the Consortium will attach to a future loan will no doubt be that regarding the disbanding of unnecessary troops throughout China, and it may be useful to summarise a few of the considerations to be held in view. The reduction of surplus provincial armies has been a difficulty ever since. the foundation of the republic; Yuan Shih-kai was confronted with much the same sort of obstacle as that which faces President Hsu Shih-chang to-day. Yuan partially overcame it in 1912 by means of advances from the sextuple group early in the year, and later with money borrowed from other foreign sources ; and his successor has to look to similar sources for the wherewithal to accomplish this essential reform, which is the first requirement of the economic and political situation in China at the moment. President Hsu&apos;s difficulty is far greater than Yuaifs was. In 1912 there was no deep cleavage between North and South, and the military commanders all over the country were not then the powerful satraps they have since become. Not only has the South to be brought into unison with the North, but the internal differences between the leaders of both North and South have to be composed before any satisfactory arrangement can be contemplated; and President Hsii has neither the prestige of Yuan nor the type of character which would justify us in hoping that any of these things will be speedily accomplished.It is understood that President Hsii has given 1,400,000 as the approximate number of officers and men in the Chinese armies to-day. We may assume that this is a paper maximum in any case, and that the real number actually maintained is less than half the figure. Mr. Bruce Baxter, an enterprising journalist who has made a study of the question on the spot, estimates that there are not over 600,000 armed men in China, and he is probably not far wrong. Such a number is largely in excess of requirements, if the personal ambitions of a dozen men are eliminated from the problem, and it should not be a difficult matter to decide how much in excess. The Chinese are easily governed, and require little extraordinary policing. It has been suggested that 5,000 trained troops of good quality would suffice to keep order in the average Chinese province under normal conditions, and certainly in Manchu times the number of really efficient soldiers maintained was less than this. If we take this figure as a basis of calculation in estimating the size of the national army which it would be prudent for the Chinese Government not to exceed, we arrive at the following approximate numbers : Men.China Proper, Manchuria and Sinkiang (twenty-two provinces), forthe maintenance of order in addition to provincial police      ...    110,000For defence and extraordinary purposes in the border provinces and territories (Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Yunnan, Szechwan, Manchuria, Mongolia and Sinkiang), say ... ... ...    140,000Total ...... ...    250,000That is to say, an efficient army amounting to not more than 250,000 men in all, should, in normal circumstances, suffice to maintain law and order throughout the Chinese dominions, and at the same time provide an adequate reserve for emergencies, outbreaks, border defence, &amp;c.Thus stated, the problem before the Chinese Government is to reduce the existing provincial armies from Mr. Bruce Baxter&apos;s estimated total of 600,000 by more than half, or 350,000, and to accomplish this without throwing the demobilised soldiers on71   [2995]
the roads to swell the groups of banditti and robbers, which have been much too common in various parts of China since the revolution. It should be a simple matter in a huge country by proper organisation to absorb such a number as 350,000 men into the labour market; but, should there be any difficulty, Mr. Baxters proposition is that pari passu with the disbandment, which of course must be supervised by some means acceptable to the consortium, there should be a Works Commission formed by the Chinese departments concerned, to which representatives of the consortium should be attached, to see that the disbanded soldier is found work or employed on road-making or other undertakings of public utility. There is no doubt that it would be far more economical in the end to go to the expense of financing a practical demobilisation on those lines than to turn the disbanded soldier loose with his arrears of pay in his pocket to fend for himself.April 19, 1920.
