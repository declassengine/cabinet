Ho. 174 (R)sub-committee.Following from Mr. Balfour for Sir m. Hankey. Begins.I think that formal decision of Cabinet with regard to civilian member of Technical Advisory Committees ought to be if possible modified.     French are vehemently opposed to it, and it has the disadvantage of increasing an already large Committee by a third without adding to it technical competence..Probably suggested object of Cabinet would be bettor met by leaving each Government to provide selection of persons whom it desires to represent them in an advisory capacity.     If any small Power is afraid of its soldiers it can send a civilian.Immediate answer is urgently required,, if possible by-Monday.   Cabinet decision necessarily deprives me of any power to negotiate working of particular point.Ends&apos;.
