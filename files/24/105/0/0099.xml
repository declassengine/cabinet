Referred to Committee of Home AffairsIfilS-Document is the Property ofgovernment.Public Libraries (Ireland) Bill.MEMORANDUM.It is proposed by this Bill to extend the limit on the rate that may be raised in Irish boroughs and towns for the pur-poses of the Libraries (Ireland) Acts, 1855 to 1911.The present statutory limit is one penny in the pound (with a special limit of three-halfpence in certain county boroughs), and owing to increases in wages and in the cost of fuel and books, a rate within the limit is entirely inadequate to meet the expenses in many places. In the City of Dublin the corporation, in order to avoid closing the public libraries and the Municipal Art Gallery, are committed to an expen-diture considerably in excess of the limit. Belfast Corporation have also pressed for an extension of the limit, and similar conditions exist elsewhere.It is proposed by the Bill to substitute threepence in the pound as the normal limit, with power to the Local Government Board to authorise an extension of a further threepence in county boroughs. In England the corresponding rating limit was repealed by section four of the Public Libraries Act, 1919.The Bill is urgent, as unless the extension is made the libraries and Art galleries may be closed, and members of the corporations may be surcharged in respect of expenditure already incurred with a view to carrying on these institutions in the interests of the public.
