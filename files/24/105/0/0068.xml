T , - Copy No     3SECRET C.P.1268.Wheat Positloh and tho Bread Subsidy* Memorandum by tho Qhairman, Royal Commission on &apos;:heat Supplies, with reference to Cj:Po1245Si :while sharing Mr.chamberlain s&apos; desire to reduce the Bread Subsidy, I question the wisdom of increasing the price of flour at the present juncture, in order to raise the quartern loaf by id.Flour was raised by 19/3 per 280 lbs.se^en weeks ago. Bread prices were de-controlled a month ago.   To wary the price so soon, and before the trade has been stabilised, would be premature, as it is quite possible that the extra Jd,would pro^e inadequate.   Frequent changes of price dislocate trade and involve immense departmental difficultyaDuring next August the prospects of the new American crops will become clear and our import requirements can be better defined.   We shall then be able to make a closer estimate of cost.   It seems far preferable to raise the price in September by a substantial figure than to add small increases at short internals.   -:Je could increase the price to co^er the higher costs incurred during the first six months of the financial yearcA higher rate of extraction Can be justified on the ground that our Bread is probably the best in Europe.   This course will in any case be desirable if the Argentine Government prohibits the export of wheat,   .7a to-day hold 730,000 tons of.,wheat is South America, and the indications are that export will shortly be forbidden.   The public would appreciate the need for a change of extraction both to conserve supplies and to protect the taxpayer..   ,(Sgd) CRAWFORD AND BALCARRESRoyal Commission&apos; on Vlieat Supplies, Trafalgar House,,   , V/aterloo Place,   ,S^M;
