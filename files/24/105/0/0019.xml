[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1020SECRET. 7/V3IMPERIAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS: MARCONI PROPOSALS.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the views of the Air Staff on these proposals.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.May 3, 1920.AIR STAFF MEMORANDUM ON THE MARCONI Imperial Wireless SCHEME.    &apos;The Air Staff has put forward no proposals for a scheme of Imperial wireless communications, but has concurred in the Admiralty and War Orlice requirements which have been laid before the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee. The Marconi scheme, if accepted by the Government, will meet the wireless requirements of the Royal Air Force.The necessity for an efficient wireless network throughout the Empire is urgent, both from a strategic and commercial point of view. Further, from a technical standpoint, it is essential that the British Empire should erect high-power stations as soon as possible, in order to establish a prior claim to the wave-lengths necessary for effective long-distance communications.   These wave-lengths are limited in number.The Air Staff are convinced that both thy necessity for economy and the shortage of personnel in the Government service preclude the establishment of a State scheme at the early date which is considered to be essential. They desire therefore to recommend the adoption of the general outline of the Marconi scheme, subject to such safeguards as may seem advisable to the expert technical and service advisers of the Government.H. TRENCHARD, Chief of Air Staff.Air Staff, April 0, 1020.305 u;
