THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION - CONCLUSIONS AS TOT7FT        UgglProm ^AOrij^TT^lffi l/ASHIUGTOtf CTOTOTO] l&apos;919,MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.It The International Labour Conference held at washington in October and November, 1919, in accordance with Article 389 of the Peace Treaty with Germany (Article 334 of the Austrian Treaty) adopted six Draft Conventions and six Recommendations! 2. It is desirable that Great Britain, having taken avery prominent part in securing the adoption of the Labour Articles of the Peace Treaties and in the proceedings of the International Labour Conference at ,J;ashingtoh, should show her intention to ensure the success of both by the early ratification of the Draft Conventions and the adoption where possible of the Recommendations which have been put forward. 3. Article 405 of the German Treaty (Article 350 of theAustrian Treaty) requires that Draft Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Conference shall within one year from the formal closing of the Conference (in this instance 27th January, 1920), or in exceptional circumstances within eighteen months of that date, be brought before the competent authority &quot;for the enactment of legisla-tion or other action&quot;.   In cases in which legislation is required. Parliament is, of course, the competent authority, and even when legislation is not needed to carry a draft convention or recommendation into effect, it will I think be convenient to regard Parliament as the authority which should express approval or the reverse of the ratification of a draft convention or of adherence to a recommendation. This is the course recommended by Mr. G.N. Barnes in his memorandum of 7th February, 1920, for the Cabinet upon the results of the Washington Conference,   The decision of1 Parliament/
*Parliament should no doubt be expressed in a declaratory resolution of the House of Commons and the actual ratifita-tlon of a draft convention or adherence to a recommendation would follow as an aot of the Crown.   Presumably, however, it will be desirable that any legislation required to carry out the intentions of a draft convention or of a recommenda-tion should be obtained before a convention is ratified or adherenoe to a recommendation is declared.   It Is thus necessary that any legislation which may be proposed in order to enable the adoption of conclusions reached In November, 1919 at Washington should be obtained by 27th January, 1921. 4. One of the Draft Conventions and one of theRecommendations approved at the Washington Conference deal with measures for the prevention of unemployment and the assistance of the unemployed, and It is possible at once to take definite action upon the proposals made therein.   Copies of the Draft Convention and Recommendations are attached.5.       Draft Convention.   I suggest that the draft convention concerning unemployment should be ratified immediately. The draft convention contains eleven articles of which the first three contain proposals for action.   These are as follows:-Article 1.    A proposal to supply the International Labour Office at short intervals with all available information concerning unemployment.   The Ministry of Labour can undertake to supply such Information in the manner proposed.Article 2.     (a)   A proposal that a system of free public employment agencies should be established under the control of a central authority acting with the advice of committees upon which representatives of employers and workers sit. the proposal is fully met already by the Employment-2- Exchanges/
&apos;   206Exchanges controlled by the Ministry of Labour.   Local Employment Committees consisting mainly of representatives of employers and workpeople advise the Ministry upon the administration of the Exchanges.(b) A proposal that where both public and private free employment agencies exist steps shall be taken to co-ordinate the operation of such agencies upon a national scale.At the discussion of the draft convention in Washington the employment agencies maintained by the Trades Unions wore regarded as &quot;private free employment agencies&quot; and these are the principal employment agencies which do not charge fees apart from the Employment Exchanges,   A measure of co-operation between these agencies and the Employment Exchanges has already been secured in the case of Trade Unions which take part in the administration of the Unemployment Insurance under the National Insurance Act of 1911.   Such co-operation will naturally increase upon the passage into law of tho Unemployment Bill now before Parliament.   It is doubtful however, whether the co-operation so obtained will be wide enough to satisfy the draft convention, and it will be necessary, as it is certainly desirable, that further steps should be taken to obtain such co-operation.   These steps will probably not require legislation and It seems safe to anticipate that the requirements of the draft convention in this respect can be met by administrative action.(c) A proposal that the various national systems of employment agencies should be co-ordinated by the International Labour Office In agreement with the countries concerned.Such co-ordination as Is here contemplated is clearly desirable and the draft convention contains the necessary safeguard that the International Labour-3- Office/
Office shall act in. agreement with&apos; the -countrlea concerned.Article 5,   A proposal that as between countries which have ratified the draft convention and have established systems of insurance against unemployment, workers of one country working     the territory of another shall, upon terms agreed between the two countries, be admitted to the same rates of benefit of such insurance as the workers of the latter country.This proposal Is fully met already by the Unempioy-ment Insurance Acts and the Unemployment Insurance Bill now before parliament to   No distinction is there made to the disadvantage of foreign as against British work&quot; people employed and resident in the United Kingdom^The following points should be mentioned in respect of the eight remaining articles of the draft convention;-Article 5*    This article requires that any country which ratifies the draft convention shall apply it to Its colonies, protectorates and possessions which are not fully self-governing.(a) exqept where owing to the localconditions its provisions are inapplicablej or(b) subject to such modifications as maybe necessary to adapt its provisions to local conditions.This article, whioh is a recitation of Artiole 421 ofthe German Peace Treaty (Article 366 of the Austrian treaty), was inserted in the Peaoe Treaties on theunderstanding (as recorded in the Minutes of theConference, though not spoclfioally expressed in theConvention) that the Mother country should be thejuctgfe&quot; as to the application of the two provisionsset out above,   The ratification of the Convention-4- will/
will not, therefore, commit this country to-any definite line of action in relation to the non-self-governing colonies, etc, or enable other countries to allege (under Article 411 of the German and Article 35C of the Austrian Treaty) that Great Britain is not fulfilling the obligations which ensue upon ratification of the ConventionoArticle 7t    The draft convention will become binding upon countries by r/hom it has been ratified so soon as the Secretary General of the League of Nations has notified its ratification by three countries who are Members of the International Labour Organisation!.Article 8,    Ratification of the draft convention involves agreement to bring Its provisions into operation not later than 1st July, 1921.   There will be no difficulty in carrying out this agreement in respect of the Draft Convention now in   $ucs^ione Recommendations *The Recommendation concerning Unemployment contains four Clauses as follows:-Clause lo    A proposal that the establishment of feen charging employment agenoies should be prohibited and that such agencies as already exist should operate only under Government license *  -Further, that all practicable measures should be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible This recommendation was opposed at the Washington Conference by all the British representatives except Mr. Stuart Bunning. There are many fee-charging and profit-earning employment agencies in the United Kingdom and in the main they fulfil a useful functiono   There appears to be no case for prohibiting the establishment of fresh agencies and no&apos;strong case for controlling their activities by a licensing system. I suggest, therefore,, that Great Britain should not adhere to this recommendation.. &apos; Clause/
Clause 2,     A proposal that the recruiting of bodies of workers in one country for employment in another should bo permitted only by mutual agreement between the countries concerned and after consultation with employers and workers in the industries affected in each country.. This recommendation was opposed at Washington by all the British representatives except Mr. Stuart Sunning, The situation contemplated in the recommendation is one which hardly arises in connection with British Industry in normal times.   Should it be found necessary to move bodies of workers Into or out of the United Kingdom it would be difficult and embarrassing to follow the procedure proposed I suggest, therefore, that Great Britain should not adhere to this recommendation,Clause 3.     A proposal to establish an effective system of unemployment Insurance.The existing scheme of unemployment insurance covers &amp;f million workpeople, and to these the Bill now before Parliament is designed to add., a further 8 millions. Groups excluded from insurance will no doubt be excluded on the ground that they do not need the protection of the scheme. I suggest, therefore, that so soon as the Bill becomes law Great Britain should adhere to this recommendation. Clause 4^    A proposal that the execution of all work undertaken under public authority should be co-ordinated with a view to reserving such work as far as practicablo so as to relieve unemployment.&apos;  &apos; Some/
Some small progress In the direction indicated has already been made.   Although the whole matter is complicated and difficult, there is, I think, general agreement that in so far as it is practicable essential public work should be so distributed as to provide the greatest possible assistance during periods of une;n-ployment.   I suggest, therefore, that Great Britain should adhere to this recommendation.(SGD.)   T. J. HAC F\MARA.May 11th 1920,
