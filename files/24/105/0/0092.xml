Military Secret. 1375flTnTlTl^^3^om Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, nhl^^ &apos;     13th May 1920.(Received 14 th.)G066. 13th May. Reference to telegram No. nil, dated 5th May. The present is by far the most difficult time of year in which to carry out the withdrawal of troops from East Persia owing to lack of water and to hot wind of 120 clays which is due to begin about end of May and renders all movement extremely arduous south of Neh. It may be possible to reduce estimate of five months but for reasons given above no such guarantee can be given.   Withdrawal has been ordered to begin at once.
