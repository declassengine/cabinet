^PROPOSED REMISSION Cg DEBTS OVINQ BY EUROPEANMemorandum by thePresident of the Board oT^Ffadc,The question whether debts owing to the British Govern-ment by our European Allies should be remitted does not turn entirely or oven mainly on economic considerations.     It is important, however, to have as clear a conception as possible-of how the economic position would bo affected.It is not proposed to discuss here Intor-Imperial war debts, but account should be taken of tho fact that the adoption of any sohomo of debt remission would inevitable determine policy in this matter to a large extent,A reference to tho figures appended to this memorandum will show that when tho proceeds of war taxation aro added to existing war indebtedness (as thoy should bo, because they equally ropresont financial resources devoted to the war) the burden borne by Franco per head of tho population is less than that borne by the United Kingdom, while that borne by Italy is considerably lass.   It further appears that Prancefs and Italy&apos;s debts to us amount to 13jV per cent of our present war debt, 30 that their cancellation would affect our position considerably; and if the United States followed suit in remitting French and Italian debts, tho French burden per head would become loss than ours, while Italy1s would be brought to a figure relatively very low, cvon when account was taken of Italy!s smaller resources.    Those conclusions must not bo regarded as affording more than very general ideas; and allowance must bo made for the fact that in no event could we expect to be reimbursed by our Allies in tho near future,--but the suggestion that the debts in question should be regarded as bad debts is surely premature,It may bo said that we should take further into account war damage and German Reparation obligations,    This is true; and it is not unlikely that the ultimate magnitude of rcpara-tion payments tends for the moment to be underestimated as a rosult of a temporary reaction of opinion.    But, on the principle of avoiding too optimistic a view of the effect of the proposed policy upon ourselves, it may,be at least assumed, for tho purpose of this discussion, that any exceptional damage and handicap suffered by Prance and Italy through the ravages of the war, will be made good by the Reparation Claims,   Thus, for the purposes of this discussion, the inequality of damage suffered, on the one hand, and the unequal amounts that will be obtained from Germany by each of the European Allies, on the other hand, may be regarded as neutralising one another.    At any rate, it is too early as Vet to assume that they will not.l/ith regard to action by the United States, throe results might follow our adoption of the proposed policy a)   In the first place America might respond by renouncing her claims for repayment of all external war debts including those which wo incurred in America In order to furnish funds to our Allies.    If this happened, tho benefit from the point of view of the United Kingdom would be undoubted; but it appears to be very unlikely,
(b) In the second place America might follow suit by remitting the debta owing by the Allies ether than the Baited Kingdom.     In this ease it might prove eventually that the United IliiKdom was left the most heavily bur-done d of all the Alliess     The future is too uncertain as yet to Justify a final judgment, but the probability of this, if substantial reparation is obtained from Germany, must not be overlooked,(o) In the third plaoe, America might insist on ropay-nent by all her debtors.    In this event tho benofit to tho ISuropoan Allies would bo littlo or nothing if our gift merely enabled thorn to pay ADorioa what thoy could not otherwise have paid - our action operating in effect as an underwriting of American debts in Europe, whieh are ropresentod in some quarters as of doubtful value as thingssbb. Tho additional burden borne by the United Kingdom would be a direct handicap, and would probably damage us still .further, indirectly, by&apos; reducing the relatively light burden borne by our. most powerful&apos; &apos; eoonomio rival.    Were these the actual.consequences, it would be difficult to pursuade&apos;the trading community in this oountry to view the policy-in a favourable light.5,    The argument has &quot;been used that our export trade would at any rate bo stimulated if the French and Italian debts to us wero written off and that   the oanoollation of our debt to America would have -a depressing effect on our exports.    This,v argument is one-sided and raises considerations of so relatively snail an order of magnitude that they&apos; ought not to bo takon into account in the determination of the issue, , - Wo have huge necessary imports to pay for and need have no fear lest the-aid we get In paying through the interest on dobts owing to us should cause an inconvenient contraction of our exports. Incidental damages and benefits are naturally caused by alter-v-ations of intornational indebtedness, but they are small in comparison with the direct gains and losses.    Moreover, it ,has&apos;&apos; fco be remembered that, in view of the profound changes that &quot;have &apos; takon plaoe in international indebtedness and the worldTs    ,/ economic oonditions, considerable industrial readjustments ,nnd rearrangements of the lines of foreign trado must be involved in any event;   and that any policy which reduced the interest owing to this country would remove the balance of trade of the United Kingdom further from the pre-war position in on adverse direotion and thus magnify, our foreign exchange problem,5.    Theso are in broad outline the immediate economic con-siderations, but it must be admitted that the settlement of the question may depend.more on moral and political than- on economio considerations.     It is not unreasonable to contend that each of the Allies might have been expootod to throw all thoir weight into such a war and that therefore on its; conclusion no debts should remain to be settled betwoon them,    For this argurnet there is very much to be said, and it would no doubt be incon-tfovertiblo if America woro convincod, but it con scarcely bo   &apos; held to cover what were in effect borrowings by us on account of our Allies, if we are to remain still liable for repayment.7.    It is also urged that our European Allies will riot be en-couraged to restore their financial and economic position unless they are encouraged by a remittance cf some of their dobtsy and .. that this oountry benefits indirectly from their recovery both through trade relations and also in view of tho amount of British money invested in them.     To those considerations, &quot;no ,doubt
some weight must be attached, but the advantage gained by this country could not possibly be represented as commensurate with the sacrifice recommended.    Moreover, the advantage would be by no means certain;   and it may be Questioned whether it would be politically possible to render it certain by making debt remission effectively contingent on a proper adjustment of finances by our Allies.8,     It has also been contended that a number of diffi-culties are being met with at the present time in cur rela-tions with our European Allies, and that these are due to some extent to the continued existence of their financial obligations to us.    In view of this, it may be necessary to make some arrangements eventually, but: it may be doubted whether the present is the most opportune momont to go beyond the remiss! on for the time of interest payments, seeing that there will probably be other matters in dispute before Europe is resettled,9*    Taking everything into consideration, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it would be unwise (while perhaps holding out prospects of some arrangement of this matter in connection with post-war settlements generally) to come to a final decision until better judgments can be formed of the capacity of the Central Empires to meet t^eir obligations, of the volume and importance of other differences to be composed, of American possibilities and our own Intor-Imperial problems,    A definite arrangement for the postponement or cancellation of interest payments for a period of years might, however, be made at once..R* Sa HOME),1st May, 1920
