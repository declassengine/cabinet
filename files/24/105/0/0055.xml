My telegram of the 5th April, No. 381 S. vTurkestan.   Kashgar telegraphs 20th April, received 6th May :--&quot; Following from Ferghana reached me last night: Mahomined Eniin joined Bolsheviks beginning of April. Lack of arms and ammunition and impracticability of continuing the struggle were the main facts in his decision.&quot; 1 gather, however, that he intends to resume opposition should favourable H opportunity occur. J&quot; General Brussillov who recently paid a visit to Tashkend worked out a scheme for the invasion of Persia and Afghanistan.&quot; Bolsheviks have sent large quantity of arms and ammunition, &amp;c, to Tashkend from Russia and Mahometan forces are being collected from Russian-Turkestan, the Bashkir Steppes, Sernireohia, and elsewhere. Preparations are not yet completed. I expect further information shortly through General Mukanov with whom I am in touch.&quot;
