CAB X DIETPetition on &quot;Official Statistic;11,ITenorandun by the President of the Board of Trade,1.     In accordance with tho deoision of the Cabinet; (Cabinet 5(20)) a memorandum act ting out the views of the official statisticians eiigar^fi in the work of the various Departments of the Government of the United Kingdom has been prepared and is presented herewith.;2,    The memorandum suggests that enquiry into tho defects of official statistics set out in the petition should be made by a Committee composed of officers encased in the statistical uork of tho various Departments,, and that a Committee of such officers should; in any case^ be established as a consultative body for the purpose of ensuring more effective co-operation and co-ordination between the different Departments in their statistical world5.    Whatever view may be held with reference to the establish ment of a central office for all statistics in this country,, such a Committee as is proposed appears to be a desirable institution^     If a centralised organisation of statistics is possible and desirable; the work of this Committee would be useful preparatory work tending towards the establishment of the Central Bureau; if such a Bureau is not desirable? the existence of a Committee for consultation and mutual assistr-ance will secure most of the real advantages of centralisation while avoiding its disadvantages *4.     There is only one observation of detail vrhich I have to make upon the recommendations of the Conference s     It is proposed under the scheme that the Committee should from time to time report the results of its conferences and enquiries to the Treasury..,     I agree with this proposal,, but I think that it should be made quite clear that the Committee will also comrmmicate any particular report or recommendation which it may make, direct to the Departments concerned,5.     On this understanding I recommend that the proposals contained in the memorandum be approved, and that the estab-vliahment of the Committee be authorised.4th May, 1920,R S. HORNL
Memorandum &quot;by a Conference of the Official Statisticians of various Government Depart-merits, upon a Petition to His Majesty&apos;a Government in regard to Official Statistics.1.    The Conference haa read the petition recently presented to His Majesty&apos;s Government representing that there is &quot;urgent need for a re-organisation of the present system of official statistics, as the foundation of a proper system of civil intelligence, in the first place for the United Kingdom, and in the second place for the British Empire&quot;/2t    The Petition states that &quot;it is generally recog-nised that official statistics, as at present collected and published, are Inadequate in arrangement and scope for the purposes they should serve&quot;, and suggests certain causes which contribute to tho defects which the Petitioners wish to see remedied,3.    After adducing certain examples of existing defects, aid pointing out the necessity for a system of civil intelligence based upon sound statistics as an essential part of the machinery needed for the considera-tion of any reform, financial, social or commercial, the Petitioners asked for a Royal Commission or Parliamentary Committee &quot;to enquire into the existing methods of the collection and presentation of public statistics and to report on the means of improvement&quot;,4*     With the main theme of the Petitioners1 contention: namely that it has become more than ever necessary to provide statistics &quot;which will help to show not only the cost of proposed social reforms, but also the results of changes in our commercial system&quot;, this Conference is in entire agreement.   The daily experie:&apos;ca of every official statistician emphasizes this aspect of tho question,   There is no difference between the Petitioners and the Conference as to the objects to be sought, or as to the unique position which sound statistics occupy in relation to every current problem or reform.5,     The Conference does not propose to discuss in this memorandum the causes suggested by the Petition as contributory to the present Inadequacy of official statis-tics, beyond observing, that certain of these causes touch issues beyond the powers and functions of official statisticians/ either severally or jointly.   For similar reasons the Conference refrains from examining the illustrations of defects in,the official statistics at pr e s ent pub 11 .i he d.6u     It is indisputable that defects do exist in official statistics, what-ever may be their cause, and the Conference wishes to identify itself with the movement towards an improvement of the existing position,     It ha3 therefore examined the first step which the Petitioners
,eoonlinend should be taken to find a remedy Tor the present ev.il, namely the appointment of a Royal Commission or Parliamentary Committee to report on the means of improvement.7.     The Conference den ires to emphasise the consider^ ation that the official statistician of each Department deals, and can only deal, with the statistics arising from the work of his Department *     It must not ho overlooked that in the main, the Departments of State exist primarily for certain specific and defined administrative purposes, and that, in the nature of the case, the collection and presentation of statistics is an ancillary function, the operation ofmvhich is necessarily limited by the field which the administrative powers cover and &quot;by the statutory limitations to vfhioh those powers are subject.80     It follows from this consideration that a full understanding of the present official statistics cannot,in general, &quot;be obtained without detailed study of the statutes governing the administrative act3 in the operation of which statistics are collected, often as a subsidiary function&quot;1&apos; of the Department concerned,     A further consequence of this consideration is the difficulty of improving and extending the present statistics without changes in the statutory structure of the administrative powers of the Department,9.     From-an intimate knowledge of these difficulties, and a clear appreciation of the time and expense that would be involved at a public enquiry in marshalling the multitudinous details of practical administrative work and presenting in lucid form the complexities of the many codes of law under which the administrative Depart&apos;--ments act,-the Conference is unanimous in its opinion, that the objects sought by the petitioners would not be best advanced by the holding of an enquiry by a.Royal Commission or Parliamentary Committee t.10.   The Conference has reached this conclusion after examining other means by which progress may be made towards the end desired in. common by the Petitioners and the Conference.11,   There has emerged from its discussion the conc3-conclusion that more co-ordination is desirable, and is attainable, between the official statistics produced by the various Departments,    Vhile each Department must be free to collect such statistics,as are primarily necessary for the efficient performance of its own particular administra-ifcve duties,there should at the same time be kept steadily inmin^
tThe function of departmental statistics as a component of national statistics.   The object to bo aimed at is the&apos; , collection and presentation of statistics &quot;by each Depart-ment in such form, and, so far as the liraits of the powers exercised permit, covering such ground, that when they are all &quot;brought together, they should constitute a harmonious group, dovetailing at every essential point, so that the statesman, the publicist and the student may have &quot;before them a co-ordinated index-of the national life and welfare drawn from the past and serving as&apos;a guide tor the problems of the future.12, The Conference has not been forgetful of the re-solutions of the British Soap ire Statistical Conference which has just concluded its labours, relating to the establishment of an Empire Bureau of Statistics.   That Bureau, if established, will, in the opinion of the present Conference, meet every object of the petitioners as respects Empire statistics, but tho Conference believes that an Empire Bureau is not the medium through which the co-ordination of the Home official statistics can be most efficiently accomplished *13, As a result of its discussion, the Conference has come to the following conclusions, which are respectfully submitted for the consideration of His Majesty1s Government,(a) There should be established a Consultative   Committee whose members should bo representatives of the departments of the Home Government which publish statistics. &apos;fhe Consultative Committee should have power to appoint such sub-committees as it may deem necessary, including national sub-committees,(b) The Committee should meet at suitable intervals for the purpose of exchange of information and experience witha view to ensuring the greatest possible utilisation of the information collected and the avoidance of duplication of worh(c) &apos;fhe Committee should enquire into the measures which would promote the co-ordination of official statistics and should consider the scope of the statistics which it is desirable to obtain in supplement thereto, he Committee should consider from time to time the most suitable statistical methods for use in connexion with the various statistics collected by the Home Departments.(d) It should be a direction to the Committee to obtain the advice and opinion of non-official statisticians and -publicists interested in statistics and to consider, in conference with such persons,any proposals for securing additional information or for preparing existing information in a revised form which they might desire to put forward.(e) Arrangements should be made for the provision of staf: not necessarily whole time, for any secretarial or clerical
assistance needed in the work of the Committee and of suitable accommodation for the meetings of the Committee ,(f) The. Quorum should be not less than six official statisticians,(g) The Committee should from, time to time report the results of its Conferences and enquiries to the Treasury,14, The Conference desires to add the further observation that contrary to the inference which might be drawn from the phraseology of the Petition there is and has been a large measure of consultation and co-operation between the statistical officers of the various Home De-par allotments,The Conference is convince^ that it the pug$pp$*4 Consultative Committee is established the fxirthep progress in the direction of co-ordination desired by the Petitioners will be achieved with a corresponding gain to administrative : efficiency.
