(P 3837) From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 10th May 1920.(Received 12th, 10_a.ni.)587 S. Secret. Mussoorie conference. Following telegram from Dobbs, No. 34 S., of 9th May, is repeated for information : -L-&quot; Mahmud Tarsi and Ghulam Muhammed came to tea with ine yesterday and sat with me for three hours, Abdul Qayum being present. After we had made mutual stipulations that conversation was absolutely non-oflicial and not to be interpreted as resumption of official discussions, they covered informally the whole scope of their policy. They said that they were very anxious for adjustment of frontier incidents as they had not yet had an opportunity of (? stating) their (? full) objects.Firstly, if we would meet them by frontier concessions, especially by cession, of Waziristan, they wished to form an offensive and defensive alliance with us against Bolsheviks, and to extricate Bokhara, Khiva and Turcomans from Russian influence. They had already secretly sent six guns and (? secret) military instructors to Amir of Bokhara, and were considering assistance to anti-Bolsheviks in Ferghana.&quot; Secondly, they wished us to help them with development of their country, especially in the development of mines, and were willing to grant us monopoly of such development.&quot; Thirdly, they hoped that we would be able to give them some financial support to accelerate their internal development.&quot;I taxed them with unfriendly attitude since the Peace Treaty, especially the stirring up of our tribes They, after some demurring, admitted that they had deliberately pursued policy of keeping frontier tribes excited against us, as they had believed that we had only made temporary peace in order to strengthen our Army, and that there would, be renewal of war after six months, and they were unwilling to let valuable (? assistance from) our tribes permanently drop from their grasp. Their policy had not been meant for policy of intimidation, but of precaution. If real friendship resulted from our discussions, these precautions would of course be abandoned. 1 told them that it was practically certain that we should-be unable to make any frontier concessions, explaining military and political reasons against them, and that we must try to arrive at a basis of friendship without such concessions They seemed much crestfallen at this, but after some discussion said that in that, event they were prepared to make more restricted friendly arrangement which would in their view be only second best, and might, they feared, not be very (corrupt group). This more restricted arrangement would be that they should do their best to disarm our suspicions by leaving the tribes alone, preventing Bolshevik propaganda, &amp;c, but they would accept help towards their development from any nation that offered it, including ourselves and the Bolsheviks, and would not give us the monopoly of the development as they would otherwise have done. They would naturally be most friendly, towards the nation that in such circumstances showed itself&apos; most liberal in assistance. However, Tarsi said that in the event of their having to give up ad hope of frontier and tribal concessions on which they had set their heart, it was essential to devise some form of purdah for them, as they could not face either their own tribesmen or ours without such purdah after what had happened during the war. I said thatjiif discussions were resumed and developed on lines indicated I should be only too pleased to help them to devise any purdah. Tarsi finally said that he would write privately, giving me three Afghan desiderata. They again pressed me very % earnestly to arrange that I should return to Kabul with them, so as to be able to den I direct with the Amir. Abdul Hadi arrives back from Jalalabad on 11th Ma\, when we shall know their views on Tandisar and Lambarbat.&quot;Reference suggestion that Dobbs should return with delegates is explained by fact that Mahmud. Tarsi had previously made this proposal to Sir Abdul Qayum. in private conversations.
