(P 3572) From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2nd May 1920.(Received 4th, 10 a.m.)534 S. Secret. Mussoorie Conference. Following telegram from Dobbs, No. 24 S., of 1st May :-&quot; 1 had four hours&apos; private discussion with Mahmud Tarsi this morning, only others present being Abdul Qayum on British side, and Ghulam Muhammad on Afghan. Arguments were at times very heated. Afghans maintained that they were bound to believe their official reports which informed them that the Afghan forces had not advanced beyond positions occupied before the signing of the Peace Treaty. 1 pointed out that even if it were admitted for the sake of argument that the Afghan forces had remained continuously in occupation within our frontiers since the signing of the Peace Treaty, such occupation would be plain contravention of Article 5 of the Peace Treaty under which the former boundaries were accepted, and must cease before the conversations could be resumed. 1 said, however, that reports from British officers were clear, and that definite aggression had taken place since Mussoorie conference began. Afghans did not attempt to argue that either Tandisar or place in question in Chitral were not within the British boundaries. They laid stress on the plea that, if aggression had taken place, it was. contrary to official orders from Kabul. I replied that this only made the position more difficult, since it showed that the officials of Kabul could not restrain local officers on the frontier. Tarsi then said that if I would give him a strong hint that we would be prepared to go some way towards meeting Afghan wishes regarding frontier and frontier tribes he would ask the Amir to order immediate withdrawal. I refused to give any hint, and told him frankly I anticipated question of frontier tribes would be most difficult of all the questions before us, and that we might absolutely fail to agree upon it, but that 1 could not understand why, When he had come to discuss freely all questions upon which we may agree or disagree, and find out points of agreements and disagreements, he would persist in heading toward(s) rocks upon which we might split, and avoid discussion of other matters regarding which very great benefits might accrue to Afghanistan. Only pledge 1 would give was that if our conversations were resumed, I would give very careful attention to their arguments about the frontier.&quot; Mahmud Tarsi said he would write to the Amir urging withdrawal of forces, but that he would be in a better position to do so on return of Abdul Hadi from (? Dakka). It looks, therefore, as if we may have to wait several days before we know whether conversations will be resumed.&quot;
