(THIS BCCTCTTT IB TIT V10T&quot;&quot;:\^r Cr&apos; HIr. mi*^J.fJJl\J7^T(&apos;    GOVflPd?&apos;^?)s v c r 2 1 i c,0vy 170 *_&apos; -  &apos; a b western,CjPj 1208. &apos;TRAD? ?r03\TQPCLl7q BILL a Memorandum by the First Commission of Worlds.i&apos;y attention has been drawn to the Draft Bill submitted by the- president of the Board of Trade to the Cabinet and the Memorandum c.P, 1074 on the difficult subject of Trade MompolieIn view of the great difficulties -with which those, response ble for business enterprises are already faced in regard to questions of labour, transport,  exchange, etc., and the un-doubted discouraging effect which the proposed increase of the Extess profit Tax is having on the leaders of inaustry generally I would like to ask; &quot;Is it wise to choose this moment to intsroduio fresh legislation which will still further disoourage and unsettle the revival of industry?11 .   The subject is well known to be one of the most difficult to deal with by Le&amp;is-lation, and the United States of America have a long record of attempts to deal wit;- Trusts and Combinations by enactment, nearly all of which havt proved abortive.The Draft Bill, while apparently very moderate in its proposals is, necessarily perhaps,  very vague in its   language and leaves a very wiae field of action to the discretion of the Boord of Trace.   Manufacturers who arc just escaping from the control of Government departments must certainly resent this revival of the power of enquiry into their most secret anc! important documents deal in i with their business, not merely by an officer of the /Board.
Beard of -trade but by an^ other person that Department may approximately oint.   Ilanufacturers remember that during the ,ar more than one Instance of confidential info mat ion being obtained and dieeloscd to trade- rivals occurred, --nd 1 can personally vouch for one caso. in which a verj impudent attempt was made to practically acquire tin  v.hoi-, of the very important manufacturing secreta of a very large firm and r the guise that the information ivns wanted by the Ministry of Junitions.It seems to me to be insufficiently appreciated that the cost of production, methods of sale anddistribution, etc., are among the greatest assets of successful manufacturing concerns,  and the possibledisclosure of this infer mat ion may have for them river,; serious consequences,   although Clause I. oub section 3 purposesto protect them against this daiger,  I think it will be generally felt that such a protection is a paper one ratherthan actual, besides, the proviso at the end of the bub-boctien leaves the manufacturer entirely unprotected against publication of all or any information, however confidential,by the Board of Oracle itself if it should think fit.03a use  K       The vagueness of the language of the draft of this clause is bound to cause grcat apprehension among the industrial world.     The term &quot;unreasonable&quot; ie entirely indefinite.although the analogy evidently to Lai1way legislation has been followed in the ;,ruft Bill and the Lailvay and Canal Commissioners are made the authority to deal with any complaints,  it must be remembered that as Parliament has fixed railway rates after a ver; long enquiry the questions that arise before the Commissioners are within relativelynarrow;
narrow 1 irnits which arc wo 1-1 understood, but there in no Kind of machinery of this sort for ordinary commercial transaction&quot;.     lib manufacturer can toll whether or not he will come within the definition of Clause I. or what may happen under Ola arc 2 or 3 to any contract he maker? ( run the conduct of business will therefore become highly speculative and difficult.     The manufacturer may arrange a long tern contract and provide all the capital and machinery to cany it out on a good ban if. of price, and yet be in the position of having thir whole arrangement upset under Clause 2 or 3 of tho Bill.Clause 2 (Sub- Section C )     &quot;Undue preference&quot; in a tern well-known in conne&apos;-t ion with Railway leg illation but its meaning when applied to general trade is unknown and arbitrary, and the word &quot;unreasonable&quot; in even worse in thin connection,     It mar be argued that a. considerable reduction in price for the supply of large quantities? of goods on a long team contra ot falls, under one of those two heading?,     Neither the seller or buyer would know whether or not tho difference of price made on such a contract would bo con side rod either &quot;undue preference&quot; or &quot;unreasonableand. this would have an extremely unsettling effsot on business.,     It is a very usual thing and quite legitimate for a large buyer of good0 to be treated better than a smaller buyer..     The seller, in order to obtain a large contract for a term of years and to secure a certainty in regard to a part of his out-put might find himself compelled to give the r&apos;ame terms to other customers of a different category, thereby reducing the price of his whole out-put to an unremunerative figure. It may be contended that the Railway and Or rial Commissioners will not be unrearenable and that thisapprehension
apprehension -nil he ill-founded, yet, the lousiness   1        S coranuaity has to carry on its affairs 0:1 certainties and not upon hypothesis.     In England the sanctity of contracts, which is deeply involve;!      this question, has always been the root principle of business.     Any legislation which tampers with tills   ay easily have the most serious consequences.      It must be recognised that trade has obviously become -acre ana : ore organised, and nost large industries have thelr associations of an open or hidden nature *     The policy of the Government has boon to promote Pea vrat ions of Employers for the purpose of dealing with labour problems and in furthering the establishment of &apos;. hit ley Councils.     The Government also has recognised the necessity for co-ordination and amalgamation of industry for t ie purpose of meeting foreign competition, especially American concerns in the export trade.    The kind of legislation which is outlined in this Bill places those organisations, especially those on a hip scale in business, at a great disadvantage, and is in the interests of the small and unorganised traders,     I cannot believe that this policy will prove beneficial either&apos; commercially or from a labour point of view,anile fully recognising that there is a difficult problem to meet in this question I would urge that the Draft Kill in not a practicable means of dealing with the question, and the introduction of such a measure is especially inopportune at the present moment,(Sd)   ALFRED KOhl).Office of works.
