PART   L-THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The general industrial situation, in so far as actual disputes are concerned, is quiet.There is no change as regards the woollen and worsted industry and the road transport industry.   The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain received the reply of the Governmentto their demands on the 26th July, and have decided to call a National Delegate conference to discuss the situation on the 12th August.    Meetings have taken place in the course of the week between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Parliamentary  Committee  of  the  Trades  Union Congress  and between some members of the Parliamentary Committee and representatives of the IrishLabour Party and Trades Union Congress.  In view of the International Labour andSocialist Conferences at  Geneva next week, it does not appear that the parliamentary committee will be able to review the situation with regard to Ireland for some time.   Thetendency of opinion in the executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union congress would seem to be that they  would prefer to discuss with the Parliamentary  Committeeof the British Trades Union Congress the miners&apos; resolution passed at the special TradesUnion Congress, rather than the railwaymen&apos;s  resolution^ especially in the.form in whichthe latter was presented  to the Prime Minister on the 22nd July.    The expiry of the last extension of the out-of-work donation scheme at the end of thepresent month and the situation which will then arise are under consideration.The Unemployment Position.    The number of H.M. Forces and  Merchant Seamen out-of-work donation policiescurrent for the week ending the 16th July was 153,893, made up of 153,059 lodged by men,and 834 by women.   On the  9th July  there were  156,844 policies current, 155,996  formen and 848  for women.    On the 16th July, 75,816 unemployment books, 53,822 for males and 21,994 for females,remained lodged by workers  under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Compared withthe previous week, when there were 51,433 books lodged by males and 21,823 by females,the  total increase is 2,560.    The total live register for all Employment Exchanges on the .16th July was 236,010men, 47,839 women and 25,463 juveniles, compared  with 234,770 men, 46,440 women and 22,760 juveniles a week ago, and 248,773 men, 47,362  women and 20,894 juvenilesa month ago.  A detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 172.FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.    Labour and Ireland.-Th.e Prime Minister received on the 22nd July a deputation from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress  who presented theresolutions passed by the special session of the Congress  on the 13th July.  The PrimeMinister was accompanied by the Lord Privy  Seal, the  Minister of  Labour, Mr. CecilHarmsworth and Sir John Anderson.   The deputation consisted of Mr. J. H. Thomas,M.P., Mr. C. W. Bowerman, M.P., Mr. J. Sexton, M.P., Mr. Harry Gosling, Mr. G. H. StuartBunning, Mr. W. J.  Davis, Mr. A. A. Purcell, Mr. A. B. Swales and,Mr. J. B. Williams.            * The text of these resolutions was given in this Report, 17th July, pp. 91-92,
169Sl.7.20. Features  of the Week-continued.     With regard to Ireland, only the first resolution of the Congress was dealt with by the deputation, namely,  that proposed  by the National Union  of  Railwaymen, which formulates  the  policy of Dominion Home Eule and an Irish truce.   In putting the resolution before the Prime Minister, Mr. Thomas gave the  question of Dominion Home Rule precedence over that of a truce and treated the second  resolution, which accepts the principle of direct action, as a matter of ways and means not suitable for  discussion at that moment.   The Prime Minister re-affirmed his previous declarations of  policy,  and emphasised the  fact he could only deal with responsible leaders of Irish opinion.     The  Parliamentary  Committee thereupon invited  representatives of  the  National Executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress to discuss the Prime Ministers statement with them, and a meeting took place on the 26th July.  The Irish representatives have issued a manifesto in which they declare that the responsible body, representative of Irish opinion, with which the Prime Minister should deal, is the body of Irish Sinn Fein members of the House of Commons.  They were only prepared to discuss with the  Parliamentary Committee an arrangement whereby  &quot; each side will engage to exercise its  utmost pressure both industrial and political, towards the application of the principles for which the Government proposed to enter the  war.&quot;  The deputation who interviewed the Prime Minister and the  members of the Parliamentary Committee who met the Irish representatives have still to report to the full Parliamentary Committee.     The most prominent  feature of the Irish situation during the week has  been the disturbances in Belfast.  The trouble in  the shipyards is reported also to have affected the dock  labourers.  In the shipyards the District  Committee of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades  Federation  are  endeavouring to remedy the  state of affairs. In the docks two unions are involved, the National Union of Dock and Riverside and General Workers  and the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos;  Trade Union.     Unemployment Insurance Bill. The Bill received its second reading in the House of Lords on the 23rd July, and was  considered in Committee on the 27th.     The Parliamentary Committee  of the Trades Union Congress met representatives of friendly societies on the 22nd July, but no solution of the difference between trade unions and friendly societies with regard to the Bill was reached.   The Parliamentary Committee have expressed their willingness  to consider a definite scheme for.a  demarcation  and exchange of functions between the two sets of bodies, and a  further meeting may take place.  A deputation from the Parliamentary  Committee met the Prime Minister on the 22nd July and presented and explained the resolution on the Unemployment Insurance Bill passed at the Special Trades Union Congress on the 13th July.*     Women, Young  Persons  and  Children (Employment) Bill. The  National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship have issued a protest against  the imposition of restrictive legislation on women, and the coupling of women and young persons in legislation prescribing conditions of employment.  They support the second clause ot the Bill, which has been deleted  in Standing Committee,  on the  ground that to restrict  the  range  of  women&apos;s employment by debarring them from working on the shift system will force women into already overcrowded.markets, with bad  wages and  poor  conditions.   Examples of the different attitudes  towards this Bill of the various women&apos;s  organisations were  given in this Report, Vol. I, No. 22, 26th  June. pp. 756, 758 and 760.    Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. The National Executive of the Labour  Party are issuing  a circular to the  affiliated organisations calling attention to this Act and  urging local Labour organisations to take steps at once to get all the informationnecessary to  deal with inquiries, to open inquiry offices and generally to spread information about the Act.  The Daily Herald  is publishing a pamphlet on the Act which local Labour organisations are recommended to distribute.    H.M.  Stationery Office have published a pamphlet prepared in the Ministry of Healthwhich gives  a summary of the principal provisions of the Act.    Employment Exchanges. The Committee  of Inquiry resumed their sittings on the 20th July.  Mr. A. C.  White,  representing the National Federation of Building TradeEmployers, said that the general opinion of the members of this Federation was  that the Exchanges were of little practical value  to the building industry.  Efficient men  were able to find  employment through the usual channels and only the &quot; riff-raft &quot; of workmenused the Exchanges.  Employers  could obtain better workmen through the trade union officials.  Mr. J. Sexton, M.P., representing the transport workers, described the scheme under(B 16312)* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 3,, 17th July, p. 93.,
 Features of the Week-continued.] which the transport workers at Liverpool Docks were found employment.  He said that where the Exchanges fail is in attempting to deal with those industries already three parts organised.  The committee met again on the 23rd, when evidence was given by Mr. F. G. Bowers, Accountant General, Ministry of Labour,  and Mr. Thomas Biggart, solicitor, who appeared on behalf of the  Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation.  The former pointed out that there had been a considerable reduction in salaries.  In explaining the difficulty of giving the actual cost of a specific service he said that the Ministry had to carry on many different duties in considerably over 2,000 buildings.   Mr. Biggart expressed the view that the general opinion ot the employers was  that  the  Exchanges were of no service to them.   Many of the workers received  through  the  Exchanges  were of unsatisfactory character.  So far as the  future  supply of labour was  concerned his  federation were strongly  of  the opinion  that there  was no necessity for  the  continuance of the Exchanges. Industrial and Other Organisations.     The Labour Party. A  joint committee of the  National Executive and the Parliamen- tary Labour Party has been appointed to consider the best methods of carrying on the work of the Advisory Committees of the Labour Party, so as to meet the needs of Labour members of the House of Commons.  , Mr. G. D. H. Cole has resigned his position as secretary of these committees and it has been decided to appoint in his place a full-time official, who will be one of the salaried staff of the Labour Party.     The National Federation of Women Workers. The biennial conference of the Federation was held at Sheffield on the 23rd and 24th  July  with the president, Mrs. A. Lauder, in the chair. The chief business on the agenda was the resolution, moved by Miss Mary Macarthur, that the Federation should  amalgamate with the National Union of General &quot;Workers, a scheme having been worked out since the Federation^ last meeting.  This scheme provides for the retention of autonomy by the Federation, who will become the women&apos;s section of the National Union, electing their own executive council and holding their own meetings.  The resolution was carried by 325 votes to 13.     Miss Margaret Bondfield moved a resolution calling upon the Government to give effect to  the  resolutions of the  Washington International Labour Conference  concerning the employment of women before and after child-birth, by the introduction of a Bill providing benefits for mothers and children on a universal and non-contributory basis.  This, with a further resolution demanding the provision of pensions for  mothers to  enable them to remain at home, was carried  unanimously.   The position of workers under Trade Boards administration was  also discussed.     On the second day Miss Bondfield reported on her visit to Russia, and the conference passed  a resolution demanding the official  recognition of  the Soviet  Government and expressing sympathy with the peoples of Central Europe.  Motions on the housing problem, the enfranchisement of women under 30, unemployment, the cost of living, and the national- isation of land, mines and railways were also discussed. Trade Union Topics.     National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union. It  is  reported that negotiations between thisunion and the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers, and Bakers,  have resulted, not in a proposal for immediate amalgamation, but in a scheme for closer co- ordination and joint working between the two societies, to ensure the fullest co-operation inall negotiations and disputes.  A considerable measure of joint action among the various sea-going workers&apos; unions is already provided  for, through, the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council. These two unions will, however, have in future a still closer arrangement, which may pave the  way to complete amalgamation at  a later stage.   The negotiations  between theNational Sailors&apos;  and Firemen&apos;s Union and  the two  other seamen&apos;s unions, the British Seafarers&apos; Union and the Hull Seamen&apos;s Union, are still proceeding.     Bristol Ex-Service Mew.-The members of, the  International  Union of Ex-Servicemen who have marched to London from Bristol were welcomed on their arrival on the28th July by the newly-constituted  Communist Party, at a demonstration in trafalgar square.   One of the men&apos;s leaders stated that  they expected to get nothing put  of thePrime Minister, although 10,000 ex-Service men in  Bristol with between 20,000 and 30,000dependants, were on the verge of starvation.  They had no intention of being starved intorejoining the Forces.   The&apos; marchers would  endeavour to prevent the governing classesfrom obtaining recruits from the coming generation.                     -
NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES. Demands and Negotiations. Mining and Quarrying.     Coal Miners (National). On the 26th July the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of  Great.Britain met the President of the Board of Trade, to receive the Government^ reply to their double claim for a flat rate advance  of 2s. per day for adults over 18, Is. for youths between the ages  of 18 and 16, and 2d.  for those below 16, and  reduction of 14s. 2d.  in the price  of household coal.  Sir Robert Home stated that the  Government definitely refused, these  demands.  Subsequently the miners&apos; executive decided to call a national delegate conference on the 12th August. It is  probable that this conference. will have to decide whether to take a national ballot on the question of a strike to enforce these demands ; it may also decide to abandon the claim for reduced prices and substitute a single demand for a greater increase in wages.           ...... Transport.     Tramwaymen (National). The executive of ;che  United Vehicle Workers have decided to refer the demands of the various branches for new  wages increases to a special committee with a view to their co-ordination and the preparation of a uniform claim which will be placed before the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for presentation to the employers. Printing and Allied Trades.     Printers. For the action, of the Joint Industrial  Council in connection with this dispute see  p. 186 below. Strikes and Lock-Outs. Textile Trades.     Lace Operatives (Nottingham). The operatives in the plain net section of the Notting- ham lace trade, who struck on the 11th June, Have determined to remain on strike despite the refusal of the Derby  and  West of  England operatives to support them.  The strikers, who are members  of the  plain net section of the Lace Makers&apos; Society, have also decided to sever all connection with the other districts. Woodworking.     Furniture Workers (Leeds District). Furniture workers at  Halifax and Brighouse struck during the week.  No change has occurred in the other districts affected.* Food, Drink and  Tobacco.     Margarine Workers (Fulham). Efforts were made at a conference on the 20th July to bring about a settlement of the strike j at Messrs. Van den Berghs&apos; works, which began on the 5th July, but  without success.  The firm state that they have closed down per- manently. Public and Public Utility  Services.     Street Paviors  (Leeds). The street paviors  and masons employed  by the  LeedsCorporation struck on the 17th July,  owing to the  refusal  of the local authority to paythe building trade rates of wages.  Sympathetic action is threatened  by members of theFederation of Building Trades Operatives.

Statistical. During the week the men&apos;s live register has increased by 1,240 and thewomens live register by 1,399.   The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies insuspense, show an increase of 188 as regards men and a decrease of 1,063 in respect ofwomen.  Increases in the men&apos;s registers are reported from the London and South-Eastern,West Midlands, Yorkshire and East  Midlands, North-Western and Wales Divisions.  TheExchanges  showing  the largest increases  are  Clapham Junction, Shoreditch, Stepney,Leicester, Barrow, Birkenhead,  Liverpool, Manchester, Newton Heath, Southport, Stock-port, Bristol (Eastville) and Greenock.  The occupations chiefly affected by the increases are those of painters, builders&apos; labourers, fitters, turners, wiremen, engineering labourers,riveters, shipyard labourers, metal machinists, boot and shoe workers and motor drivers.    Decreases  in the  register are reported from  Camberwell  Green, Cambridge, GreatYarmouth,  Reading, Preston, Elswick, Gateshead, Heaton, Stockton, West  Hartlepool,Swansea Docks and  Aberdeen.   The occupations chiefly affected are those  of shop assis-tants,  porters, clerks,  and general  labourers.    As regards the women&apos;s registers all the divisions show increases in the live registerexcept Wales and Ireland.  The Exchanges  showing  the  greatest increase are Stepney,Reading, Birmingham, Leeds and Greenock.  The occupations chiefly affected  are those ofnon-resident domestic servants,  metal machinists, tinplate workers, tailoresses  and factoryworkers.Metis  Employment.    General Outlook The  situation in the country generally during the week has been rather less favourable.   The reports from a number  of districts are not free from indications of the  near approach of a period of industrial depression.    From the North-Western Division it is reported that  while there is a general falling off in trade the tendency is specially marked in the Liverpool district, particularly in the shipbuilding, ship-repairing  and allied industries.   This slackness appears  to be due, inthe main, to the fact that all orders  have been fulfilled.  The lack of fresh orders appearsto have been accentuated by the present high cost  of production and further demands forincreased wages recently put forward.  There is no change in  the position of the cottonindustry, and a  number of Exchanges continue to report short-time working arrange-ments, and extended  stoppages at  holiday periods, due  to a  scarcity of  orders.  It isconfidently hoped the  trade will experience a revival in a  few weeks.    It is reported from the Northern Division that slackness  still prevails in the ship-building industry in  the Tyne-side and Wear-side areas owing to transport difficulties and
 the  consequent shortage of materials.  Employers are unable to engage new labour  to any appreciable extent.  There are also indications that the general engineering industry on Tyne-side is suffering from a temporary depression.  The industrial position on Tees- side, however, still continues to be good.  Employers are able to give regular employment, and  in the case of three firms extensions are being made.  The general depression recently reported in the Hartlepools area is less marked, and prospects are brighter.     There is a continuance of the depression which has  been reported for a number  of weeks in the leather, boot and shoe, hosiery, lace-making, and jewellery trades.     Bradford report that the existing conditions, especially in  relation to the prices  of. raw  materials, are  adversely affecting the textile trade.  So  far only the labour in the wool-sorting and wool-warehousing  sections is involved, but there  are indications  of coming slackness on the manufacturing side, as not much new business is being transacted.     Industrial Developments. Ponders End report that Messrs. Lewis &amp; ToAvers, Dalston, glass bottle manufacturers, are negotiating for land in the district, and have been making inquiries at the Exchange regarding the supply of local labour.  Their requirements have been brought to the notice of the Local Employment  Committee.   The firm of Erinoid, Ltd., Lightpill, are erecting large premises at Yate in the  Stroud area, which, it is hoped, when completed will absorb a considerable proportion of unemployed skilled and unskilled labour.  Ilkeston report that the Rutland Foundry Co., Ltd., contemplate making large extensions to their works.   The plans  submitted by Messrs. Pontefract &amp; Co.,  for a new clothing factory at Goole,  have been approved, and at Gateshead-on-Tyne a new paper factory is in coarse of erection.     Labour Reductions. The Brighton and  Hove  Gas Co. are standing off over 60 men owing to lack of orders for gas-fitting.   Chatham report further reductions of dock workers. The  Chilworth Powder Co., Ltd.,  Guildford. who  have gone into voluntary liquidation, have given  notice to their 50 remaining workpeople.  Messrs. Endacott &amp; Co., London, scientific instrument makers, have closed down  owing, it is alleged, to foreign competition and  the high price of labour.  The closure affects 380 workpeople.   Rainsgate report that the Richborough staff are being reduced by one-third, and that discharges are now taking place at the rate of 250 weekly.  Plymouth report the closing of tin mines at Callington and  Gunnislake, by which 60 men are affected.     Shortage of Labour. The manager  of the London (Central) Exchange for the Building Trades reports  that the number of vacancies notified is decreasing considerably except  as regards bricklayers.  It is still difficult to secure good joiners, but the supply of carpenters has improved.  There is still some unemployment in the painting trade, but plasterers for both solid and fibrous work are still difficult to secure.     In  many provincial districts  the  inadequate supply of skilled building operatives continues to affect the progress of housing schemes  and other building operations.     From various centres unsatisfied demands  are reported for iron and brass  moulders,copp3r3iiithi, horizontal borers, sheet-metal workers, smiths, wheelwrights, wagon builders and  repairers, and  nut and bolt workers.  The long-standing demands for chain-makers at Blaydon-on-Tyne, and for weavers at Todmorden, are  still unsatisfied.    Shortage of Material. Croydon report  that  Messrs. Lacey-Hulbert  &amp;  Co.,  Ltd., engineers, could employ many more men if they could obtain adequate supplies of steel. At Sheffield the engineering shops are seriously crippled for want of castings.  At Granthamthe  shortage of  material is still  very marked.  The  Co-operative  Wholesale Society,Felling-on-Tyne, are receiving inadequate supplies  of polished, silvered and bevelled plate-glass.  There is a  shortage of  iron at  Southwick-on-Wear.  Coatbridge  still report  a shortage of  material affecting the local tube and boiler works.. Women&apos;s Employment.    General Industrial. Situation. The position has not  changed  to  any great extent.A general depression in trade continues in the majority of the manufacturing centres, and,whde most of the industries are hopeful of a revival in  the autumn, some anxiety is feltfor the intervening period.  As the general practice, up to the present,, has been to arrangeshort time rather than to discharge workwomen, the registers of the Exchanges have shown only small increases.    The state of employment in the cotton areas of the North-Western and the Yorkshireand East Midlands  Divisions is still unsatisfactory.  General  slackness, increased by thetrader  holidays, is  being experienced in  most districts, but steady trade is reported  at
 Nelson, Oldham, Royton and Wigan.  Although there  is a marked slackening in the woollen, worsted and rag industries, it is reported that employers at Batley and Liversedge are still willing to accept learners for weaving.   The  manufacture of lace, hosiery, and boots and shoes continues to be abnormally quiet in all  areas.    Difficulty is still experienced in placing semi-skilled clerks and shorthand-typists in most districts,  but a demand for experienced clerical workers is still reported in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh.    Despite slackness in trade, the unpopularity of domestic service persists; it is noted, however, that a large number of unskilled workers in Scotland and Wales are now accepting seasonal domestic vacancies in hotels.    Local Reports. Slackness  is again reported in the factory areas of London.   Tin box makers, leather stitchers, rubber  workers, needle-workers, and semi-skilled clerks pre- dominate on the live registers  ; and vacancies have been notified only for skilled laundry hands, cardboard box makers,  wire mattress weavers, upholsterers, and collar machinists.In addition there is the usual  demand for domestics.   Maidstone report that  the localfruit season has been a failure, but that arrangements are already in hand for the cominghop-picking season.   Agricultural activity is again reported at Eaversham, Canterburyand Eufreld.    Small discharges  and general  slackness in trade are reported in the South-WesternDivision.  Tailoring is quiet at Basingstoke, Bath and Devonport, and wicker and uphol-stery work is  slack at Bridgwater.  The corset trade  at Portsmouth is reported  to beunsettled.  Messrs. Morelands, Ltd., Gloucester, match manufacturers, have closed someof their departments  temporarily owing to lack of orders. . Difficulty is experienced infilling withy-stripping vacancies at Bridgwater in consequence of the low rate of pay.    The West  Midlands Division  again report a shortage of skilled brass polishers atAston and Sparkhill, and of brassfounders at Selly Oak, but the jewellery trade in Birming-ham is exceedingly quiet.  It is not expected that this industry will revive until orders forthe Christmas trade are received in the autumn.  The demand for skilled pottery workers continues at Stoke-on-Trent.    The depression in the leather trade is being felt acutely at Northampton, Leicester, Kettering, Norwich and Olney.   Discharges are reported  from Reading, of women employed at the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s jam works and by Messrs. Huntley &amp; Palmer, Ltd. A large number of women have, however, been placed in agricultural work, chiefly at Kings Lynn and Norwich.    In addition to quietness in the textile industry, general slackness is reported in the North-Western Division  in connection  with tin,  wire  and cable work, and the  manu-facture of rubber, waterproof garments, clothing and silk.  A large number of women havebeen employed during the last month in fruit picking and jam making, over 500 women being placed in the Middleton district alone.    Carlisle report a demand for women for work in laundries,  restaurants and  preservefactories.  Other districts in the division,.however,  indicate decreased  opportunities. oiemployment for women, and  small discharges have taken place  at Newcastle,  Elswick,;Jarrow and Kendal.  Agricultural vacancies in the division have been rilled in co-operationwith the local branches  of the National Association of  Landswomen.    The trades holidays are still reducing the demand for women workers in Scotland and the number of applicants for employment.   Skilled women are, however, still in demand for weaving,  sewing  and domestic  work and the supply of workers in the agricultural districts is reported to be inadequate.    The fishing season, for which it was expected  a large number of women would berequired at Aberdeen, has been poor up to the present;  but, as a minimum wage of 30s.was guaranteed, no hardship has been caused to the women brought  from other areas.    The slow recovery of the calico printing trade in Alexandria and Dumbarton is respon-sible for a certain amount of unemployment among women.  Glasgow still report a shortageof raw material which continues to affect the local aerated water, provision, confectioneryand rubber trades.    The fruit-picking seasons  at Blairgowrie  and Auchterarder commenced on the  19th and 26th  July, respectively.  All the  necessary  arrangements with regard to  railway vouchers and hostels had been  completed in advance.    Substantial progress is reported in connection with the filling of seasonal domesticvacancies at the various coast towns in W7ales, and the type of women accepting thesevacancies is said to have much improved.  There is still a shortage of women labourersfor work in the Swansea brickyards.                           \

As a result of the restricted export of coal, the Barry Committee report a marked increase in the number of men on the register, and they point out that the position is really more serious than is indicated by the register.  Similar complaints have been received from Goole and other coal ports.  It is understood from the Coal Mines Department^that the whole subject is under consideration by an expert committee.     The Forest of Dean Sub-Committee of the Gloucester Committee  have for the past six months been in negotiation with the Forest of Dean authority with regard to the re-opening of the Shakemantle Quarry, which would absorb many of the unemployed workpeople in the area.  They have pointed out that, if the present lessee is not in a position to commence operations, a member of the committee is  prepared to take over the lease.     The&apos; Swindon Committee strongly urge that farms should be cultivated up  to their full food-producing capacity and that where it is found, on inspection and after due notice, that means to attain the required standard have not been adopted, the executive powers exercised by the Government during the war should be resumed.     Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment  Insurance. Further  protests have been, received against the inclusion of friendly societies and insurance companies in the adminis- tration of  the new unemployment  insurance  scheme.  The  Guildford  and the  Leigh Committees are especially emphatic on this point.     Training. The Deptford Committee express regret at the department^ decision that it is necessary  for committees to give notice to the authorities in charge before a visit can be paid to a training centre.  In their opinion, if warning is given the object of the visit is defeated.  Dumfries have made application for Local  Technical Advisory Committees in bootmaking and  tailoring to be set up in the area.  The Swindon Committee protest against the inadequacy of training facilities for disabled men in their  area, and propose to hold a conference on the matter with representatives of the Local War Pensions Committee.     Ex-Service Men. The Preston Committee suggest that some system should be evolved whereby ex-Service  men who have been placed in employment can be put. on a period of probation.  They state that complaints are frequently made by employers and by trade union  representatives of the unsatisfactory conduct of ex-Service men,&apos; and they think it would be helpful if a probationary period of, say, three months could be instituted with the approval of employer and workman, and a report submitted to the committee  at the^end of the period.     The suggested issue of a coloured certificate to employers who have signed undertakings under the National Scheme has met with opposition from a number of committees.     The Lincoln and  the  Woolwich Committees have  had communications from  the National  Federation  of  Discharged and Demobilised Sailors  and Soldiers expressing appreciation of their work in placing ex-Service men  in employment.     Women&apos;s Work The York Women&apos;s Sub-Committee have forwarded a resolution to the City Council and the Wool (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council urging the desirability of the introduction of new industries into the  area, in order to absorb a number of adult female workers now unemployed.  They  also recommend  the City  Council to  advertise available factory sites  in the city,  and to  give such preferential treatment as may be possible to new industrial concerns, to induce employers to transfer the  more simple processes of their industry to a York factory immediately, with a view to extension later, as may be found practicable.     Cases have been brought to the notice of the Portsmouth Women&apos;s Sub-Committee of girl  apprentices in  the millinery trade whose indentures have been cancelled by the employers on  the ground that they could  not pay the  minimum wage  for apprentices. The committee are, therefore, suggesting the formation of a number of dressmaking classes, the course to last for about four months.     Publicity. A week&apos;s publicity campaign on behalf of disabled ex-Service men is beinginaugurated by the Workington Committee during the week commmencing the 25th July, The campaign is to  open with a special Sunday appeal from the churches in the district, to be followed during the week by the exhibition at the local cinemas of the film,  &quot; Lest We Forget.&quot;   Tableaux are to be exhibited and banners displayed  at a children&apos;s gala. In addition, a personal letter of appeal is being sent to all employers who have not yet signed an undertaking under the National scheme.     (B 16312)                                                               2  A
            DISCHARGED AND  DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.    Up to the 21st July, 18,793 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled underthe scheme.   These employers control 3,084,665 workpeople and the undertakings signed by them cover 181,303 disabled ex-Service men.    The intensive canvass in connection with the National Scheme has now been completed in most divisions.  From the reports furnished by the Divisional Controllers, it appearsthat 15,545  firms have already been visited, and  that  4,278 undertakings have  beenobtained, 2,574 firms have definitely refused to co-operate in the scheme and it is presumed that the remaining 8,693 firms, or a large majority of them, still have the matter underconsideration.    Letters are being addressed by the Minister to employers&apos; federations, holders of theRoyal Warrant, and chairmen of banks, inviting their co-operation  in the scheme.     Miscellaneous. A very considerable number of protests are to hand against the recentcriticisms of Employment Exchanges in certain sections of the Press.     OUT-OF-WORK  DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Payments Made.     For return of the amounts paid upon out-of-work donation polices and in unemploy-ment insurance benefit during the last week, see the report of the Finance department under this heading on p. 185 below.Work of the Courts of Referees.

 Placings.     At a meeting of the Aberdare Local Employment Committee it was reported that the special disabled men&apos;s  register for that district had been cleared three times,  and that at present only four men were registered.  Two of these men would be taken on by the Powell Duffryn Coal Co., Ltd., as lamp repairers,, one had been submitted to the Post Office as a temporary postman  and would probably be engaged, and the other was awaiting training.   In addition to the placing of local men, five disabled men from other districts had been placed during the last fortnight.     The secretary of the  Mexborough Employment Committee  reported to a meeting of that  committee that on the 22nd June only  10 disabled ex-Service men were on the register of the Exchange and it is expected that these will shortly be placed in employment.                               JUVENILE BRANCH. Juvenile Employment Committees.     Apprenticeship. Recent  reports  indicate  that Juvenile Employment  Committees are continuing to show great interest in the problems of apprenticeship.  The Bolton, Grays, Holland and Leigh,  Tyldesley and District Committees have now established apprenticeship  sub-committees.  The Bolton Apprenticeship Sub-Committee are already dealing with the problem  in the engineering trade in consultation with representatives of the local branches of the employers&apos; association and the  Amalgamated Engineering Union. The Coventry Juvenile Employment Committee are also conferring with the local en- engineering employers&apos; federation regarding the possibility of promoting a local apprenticeship scheme.     The committees at Ipswich, Swindon,  Walsall and York have approved reports on apprenticeship.  The Swindon and  Walsall Committees,  with  a view to securing  some standardisation of conditions  of apprenticeship, are circulating their reports to employers&apos; associations and trade unions for criticism or suggestions.  The  York Committee propose that employers&apos; and workers&apos; associations  be asked to report  whether they consider it desirable to have separate committees to deal with apprenticeship in each trade or one committee to deal with  all trades in the city.     Casual Employment of Lads at Railway Stations. The Glasgow (Central)  Juvenile Advisory Committee have under consideration the casual employment of  lads at railway stations in carrying luggage.   Inquiries go to show that practically all.the lads concerned have previously been engaged in some regular form of employment, but  have drifted into this casual work through dismissal, dissatisfaction with  wages, or dislike of their previous work, and now are generally greatly disinclined to seek more suitable employment, in view of the freedom they enjoy and the money  they  earn in this way.  Their average age is 16 years and their earnings vary, as a rule, from 5s. to 7s. Qd.  daily.  In some cases as much as  1 a day is earned in the holiday season.   The work is very demoralising, gambling is rife amongst  the lads, and theft is not uncommon.  Many newsboys, it was discovered, carried bags in the morning and with the money so earned purchased their stock of noon and evening editions of the papers.  The Glasgow Committee are endeavouring to  take effective steps to stop the  employment of lads in this work.    Part-Timers (Burnley). The first annual report of the Burnley Choice of Employment Committee contains valuable statistics, particularly with reference to children working aspart-timers.  It is shown that in March of the present year nearly 75 per  cent, of the boys, and 78 per cent, of the girls, leaving school, were already employed as half-timers, largely in textile industries.  It is pointed out that when  half-time work is abolished the other trades of Burnley will be able to compete on more equal terms with the textile trades inobtaining juvenile workers, and the need for the committee&apos;s assistance  will be greatlyincreased.                   .                                    &quot;    Useful information is obtained by the committee as to the employment entered by everyboy or girl coming from an elementary, secondary or special school.  Particular efforts aremade to  secure attendance at continuation schools.   Every juvenile who does not attend on leaving the day school  is specially visited and the advantage  of continued education isexplained to the parents.  The committee find that a reminder of this kind produces good results, the proportion of school-leaving children who attended continuation schools duringthe year being 47 per cent.   Co-operation with the Employment Exchange is cordial. The question of training has been considered and resolutions advocating a survey of thewhole field of apprenticeship  have been fonvarded to  the Board of  Education and theMinistry.

The Director at Birmingham reports that great uncertainty exists as to motor engineer-ing, and the present outlook is not hopeful.  In the motor trade further reductions insecretarial and administrative staffs were effected during the week.  A considerable numberof applicants who  were, during the past  twelve months, placed with motor firms, haveapproached the department for further assistance, owing  to their being again unemployed.Difficulty is being experienced in dealing with these men, as in most cases only temporaryemployment is available.  The motor accessory trade, on the other hand, continues brisk, anumber of firms being at present anxious to enlarge their premises.    A candidate on the Belfast register has been placed in employment in connection withflax growing and handling  at a salary of  1,000 per annum.  Another has obtained aposition as assistant harbour master in Nigeria.    [Reference to matters of interest to  the  Appointments  Department  will also be found onpage 195.]                                                            .TRAINING   DEPARTMENT.                              EX-SERVICE  MEN.General.    Statistical. On the 21st July 24,095 men were in training, as against 24,115 on the14th July, and 24,285 on the 23rd June.  On the 21st July there were 22,013 men awaitingtraining, the corresponding totals for the 14th July and the 23rd June being 22,084 and23,626, respectively.    On the 21st July the number of men whose training had been completed since the1st August, 1919, was 13,430, the totals for the 14th July and the 23rd June being 13,056and 11,781, respectively.    There has been no material change during the week.  The number of terminations isnormal and though the net result shows a slight further reduction in the waiting list, thisis more than accounted for by a reduction of 121 in the London figures.   A good manydivisions show small increases.    The waiting list for Ireland contains the greatest number of names, 2,931,  while theSouth-Eastern Division, 2,817, and the Essex and East Anglian Division 2,370, come next.All these divisions are still awaiting for their factory schemes to mature.  London has theonly other list  containing over 2,000 names;  the position in  this area  has  improvedconspicuously during the past few months.  In most other divisions the lists are  graduallybeing brought to reasonable proportions.    A return of the men in training on the 30th June shows that of a total of 23,926 men,4,861 were in Government Instructional Factories, 8,763 in employers&apos; workshops and 11,302in other centres.
Ex-Service  Men-continued.     Exhibitions--The.  chief event of the week  has  been the exhibition at the CentralHall, Westminster, which, in the absence of the Prime Minister owing to pressure of other duties, was opened by  Mr. Bonar Law on the 21st July.  Dr. Macnamara presided at the ceremony, which was very well attended, and both he and Mr. Bonar Law described insome detail the effort that was being made by the Government to discharge the debt thatthe nation owes to the men who have been maimed and disabled in the war.  The minister was supported by Mr. Balfour and Mr. Walter Long, both of whom addressed the meeting,Lord Lee of Fareham, Mr. Ian Maepherson, Mr. Fisher, and other members of the Cabinet.A vote of thanks to Mr. Bonar Law was moved by Sir James Cunie and seconded by sir robert Blair and supported by Mr. B. S. Gott, Divisional Directors of Training for Londonand Middlesex, respectively.   A vote of thanks to the Minister was moved by Major-general sir Frederick  Maurice and seconded by Captain Simpson,  representing associations of ex-Service men.    Music was given by the &quot; Harmonics&quot;  Band, consisting of disabled ex-Service mentraining as musical instrument makers at the Holloway Polytechnic.    The exhibition affords e\incidence of the very real success that has  attended the efforts of the Ministry.  The Minister assigned the credit to the combination of skill, patience and sympathy on the part  of the instructors, with determination and industry on the part ofthe men.    The fact that, in addition to  the display of finished products, a large number of mencan be seen working at their trades, imparts an air of  reality to the exhibition, and affordsan opportunity for practical tests.    Civil Liabilities, Grants. Arrangements have now been made whereby disabled ex-Service men trained by  the Ministry may be considered eligible for grants from the Civil Lia-bilities Department when setting up in business on their own account.   The grants are subject to the condition that the man is setting up  on his own account in the  trade forwhich he has been trained, and  that  the Divisional Director, and, if the trade is oneof those classed as special, the  Local Technical Advisory  Committee, certify that heis. unable to obtain employment  in  the trade by reason of his disability, or special local circumstances.    Hostels. The Hostels Section have inspected the Springfield College, Moseley, whichis being acquired as a training college for elemental teachers to settle questions  of- house-hold and canteen equipment and the management of such parts  of  the premises as areto be used as a hostel.    At  Cambridge, application has  been made by  the  Divisional  Director for furtherhostel accommodation for from. 50 to  100 men.  A proposal to establish a hostel at Dundeeto accommodate 88  men  and a canteen for a  total  of 188 in connection with the newInstructional Factory is receiving attention.    At the beginning  of July hostel accommodation was provided by the Ministry for approximatly 800 men in training, and about half these  places are now  filled.   At sevencentres canteens are being carried on under the direct control of the Ministry, and atfour factories mess-rooms have  been established.    Government Instructional Factories. H.M. Office of Works are anxious to employ menwho have completed their training in the building courses at the Cricldewood Factory,and have asked for particulars of the men who will be available for placing next month.    Efforts are  being  made to obtain additional factory accommodation in Leeds andIreland.  At Leeds it is hoped to secure premises which  will provide&apos; accommodation for about 230 men in tailoring, wireless telegraphy, electrical wiring and oxy-acetylene welding.    A proposal  is now before the Treasury for the  purchase of the  Franklin  Laundry,Belfast, and the matter is under discussion with the Irish Office  of  Works.   These pre-mises, if acquired, will ultimately accommodate 600  men.  Training will be given in thebuilding, furniture, leather  goods, boot and shoe,  and  watch and clock trades.  the divisional Director reports that as soon as he gets possession of the Gormanstown Factoryhe can make an  immediate start in training 200 men in rural handicrafts, agriculture, andalso in hairdressing.    Equipment and Supplies. The position as regards woodworking machines has con-siderably improved recently.   Various machines have been inspected at Hunslet, Leeds,and the Disposal Board have been asked to earmark these machines for the department.Offers of machines have also  been received from Beachley,  Portbury and Portishead.  Aconsiderable consignment of watch lathes from Switzerland has recently been delivered.    Deliveries to Central Stores during the week include tools for plumbers and plasterers  ;boot  and shoe,  tailoring, signwriting  and  woodworking tools;  wood  lasts,  plumbers&apos;toolbags and consumable stores.
Ex-Service Men-continued.Schemes Sanctioned.    During the week eight schemes, providing 119 places, have been sanctioned.  Includedin this number are 20 places for training as sanitary inspectors.National Trade Advisory Committees.    Printing. At a meeting of the committee on the 1st July the question of trainingin process work was raised.  It was pointed out that it would be impossible to find vacan-cies for trainees on the completion of training.  A suggestion emanating from the LondonLocal Technical Advisory Committee that the men should be transferred to  some othersection of the trade  and the training which they had already received assessed by theLocal Technical Advisory Committee was unanimously agreed to, and a, definite resolution passed accordingly.    Tailoring.-k meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee for Bespoke Tailor-ing was held on the 21st July, at which the rates to be paid by employers during theproposed extended period of training were finally agreed.    A resolution  that  the department be asked to convene a meeting of the  chairman and vice-chairman of every Local Technical Advisory Committee, for the 13th September,to consider the training, after-employment and general welfare of disabled  men in thetailoring trade, was unanimously adopted.Local Technical Advisory Committees.    Lace.-The first  meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee for Nottinghamand District was  held  on the 15th July.   The local opportunities for training, which is entirely in a workshop, are extremely small at present, but it was agreed to announce thescheme in the Press,  through the local Chamber of Commerce, and through the employers&apos;association.                           WOMEN&apos;S TRAINING.General.    New Coohery Course Sanctioned (Woolwich). A special three months&apos; course in cookeryfor 20 to 24 trainees  at the Joan of Arc Hostel, Woolwich, has been sanctioned this week.This class will be filled by girls who have  been employed as clerks in Government depart-ments  and have been recently discharged.  It has been extremely difficult to  overcome the reluctance of this type of girl to take  up anything in the nature of domestic work, orto consider any other form of  employment than clerical work.  However, the success oftrainees from other cookery classes in securing good posts in institutions&apos;and large estab-lishments, was pointed out and stress was laid on the advantages of specialising in cookeryrather  than taking general domestic work.   It is hoped to convert into skilled cooks, whoneed never have difficulty in finding well-paid employment, semi-skilled clerical workers,who would have found such employment casual, and offering small chances of improvement.    Dressmaking (Liverpool). Satisfactory reports have been received  concerning several of the girls who have  left the Liverpool dressmaking class.  One states that she is managingto get  enough work  at home to keep her  employed on blouses and jumpers, with  very good weekly profit.  Two other trainees  who had been sent to a dressmaker in Bootleare giving much satisfaction and are said to be as useful as the majority of skilled workers.    Dressmaking  (Newcastle). This  class  is fully occupied on work for private orders.Several local firms of good standing  are anxious to supply cut-out materials for traineesto make up, and  will pay the usual factory rate  tor the work done.  This arrangement would give the class a valuable opportunity of making garments up to the standard of theworkshops in wrhich they hope eventually to be employed.  The manager of  one firm ofcostumiers has visited  the class and expressed satisfaction with the workmanship.  Hehas arranged for the instructress to  visit his  workrooms to see the type and variety ofwork done there, and has informed her that he would be willing to take all of the traineesat the  end of the course as costume finishers.    Cookery (Leeds).-Although  sanction  was given  for the Leeds cookery course tocontinue for six weeks after the 30th June, advantage wras not taken of this extension asthe trainees had accepted situations, in some cases with employers who had been waitingseveral weeks.  Four of the  nine trainees  have taken posts as resident cooks, two at 15s.per week, one at  36 per annum, and one at  40 per annum.  Another is employed ascook at a large factory.  One,  more ambitious, is  taking a confectioners business.
Women&apos;s  Training-continued.    Domestic  ( arrow).--There has  been no difficulty in connection with  the  Barrowdomestic course in getting the trainees to take residential posts.  Seven of the girls havebeen satisfactorily placed, and the  others are in negotiation with employers in varioustowns.  The Woman Training Officer reports that the class is considered locally to havebeen a great success, and that the Local Education Committee are considering the possi-bility of continuing domestic training in tho same premises under their own management.    Domestic (Newcastle).--The principal of the local school of cookery spoke very highlyof the Newcastle  domestic class, stating that  the  standard of efficiency had increasedconsiderably since the first class began training in September, 1919.  Fourteen of the 18trainees went to.good situations within a few days of the closing of the class.    Waistcoat Making (Birmingham),-Oia\j 30 women remained in training in Birming-ham after the 30th June.  The twenty-six trainees in the waistcoat-making class whichfinished on that date have all been successfully placed.in employment.    Clerical (Leamington). The Leamington clerical class closed on the 30th June witha public distribution of certificates.   All the 32 trainees had gained the Pitman&apos;s TheoryCertificates.   Thirty have passed the 80 words per minute test, and half of  these can do100 words per minute.   Canvassing for employment for the trainees has not proved very successful, as there is always a slack time in the summer.  The principal of the school is,however, very anxious that the girls should not  lose their speed while waiting for employ -ment, and has arranged a daily attendance for a short time without fees.    Glovemaking (Walsall). Training in glove making at Walsall ceased on the 30th June.All the trainees have  been  retained  in employment by the firm who undertook their training.Disabled Nurses.    During  the week  three new  applications have been received from disabled nursesdesiring training.   One of them is anxious to obtain a diploma of the Incorporated society of Chiropodists.    Seven cases obtained sanction during the week.   A nurse who was originally trainedat Guy&apos;s Hospital and obtained a diploma of the Incorporated Society of Trained Masseusesdesires to take a short course in massage&apos;, which she has not lately practised. Other coursessanctioned cover dispensing, health visiting, poultry farming, secretarial work,  dressmakingand infant welfare work.    During the week three Courses were completed, two at the Westbourne Grove school of Cookery.   The principal reports that both disabled nurses passed with maximum marksin the practical examination.   The third completed course is one in dressmaking.    A grant has  been received from the Disabled  Officers&apos; Fund of the Officers&apos; Associa-tion to assist a nurse who is taking a course of training, but whose disability has caused hermuch  trouble during the past two or three months, and whose financial  worries werethreatening to become a hindrance.to her satisfactory progress.War Widows and  Dependants.    During  the week seventeen new applications have been received, bringing the totalto  2,455.  In  10  further cases training was  authorised, bringing the  total to 1,357.Thirteen applications were rejected  or withdrawn, and there were  six withdrawals fromtraining.    At the end of the week there were 364 war widows in training, and 638 had completed their training.    Since the transfer of the training powers to the Ministry  of Labour,  on  the  1stSeptember,  1919,  1,219 applications from  war widows have been received.  During thesame period 640 have been sanctioned, and 735 have been rejected or withdrawn.   &amp;
                         APPRENTICES  AND  BOYS.                        INTERRUPTED  APPRENTICESHIPS. Questions Affecting the Scheme.     Wages. In the North-Western area  considerable difficulty is being experienced in bringing apprentice motor mechanics under the engineering scheme on the basis of the rates prevailing in that industry.  This  difficulty  arises in all types of garage.  Local head- quarters report that in some cases the owner  of a very small garage has reinstated a pre- enlistment apprentice, obviously on sympathetic grounds ;  but in other cases large garages, where the prescribed rate for  journeymen engineers rules, definitely refuse to  accept returning apprentices at more than  a rate  of  3 per week.     Local headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area expect that the apprentice rates established by Trade Boards may prove a source of difficulty to some of the small employers in the industries concerned.     A low journeyman&apos;s rate has been found to prevail in the picture-frame making trade at Brighton.   This is attributed to the fact that the men are guaranteed work throughout the year.   A firm, who appear to be  typical, pay their journeymen 55s. for a 56-hour week. They have agreed, however, to  pay their apprentices on the basis  of a 60s. rate in order to conform to the scheme. The Scheme in Operation.     Statistics. Up to the 21st July, 41 schemes had been approved, and applications have been received in respect of all of them.  The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers  fur apprentices, for the week ending the 12th July, was 268, making a total of 42,108.  The number of applications received from apprentices was 321, making a total of 47,246.     Up to the 21st July, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 40,446 apprentices.  Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 38,887  apprentices, employed by 15,416 employers. Of these, 13,948 were under the engineering scheme, and 6,475 under the building  scheme.  The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration  of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 7,771.     Applications. A statement was made at one of the meetings of the Torquay Chamber of Commerce, that difficulty in absorbing ex-Service men was caused by the wage demands of returning apprentices.  Consequently the secretary of the Local Employment Committee has offered to arrange for an  explanation of the scheme  at a subsequent meeting  of the Chamber.     Messrs. W. Arnold, Manchester, coach builders and motor engineers, have already brought under the scheme a  number of apprentices who are unable to return to their pre-war employers.  This firm and another, Messrs. Cockshoot &amp; Co., Ltd., now desire to find other discharged soldiers  to train for their industry.  They are described as the two largest firms of motor body builders in Manchester.    Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. Hitherto the scheme for  the  pottery industry has been adopted only to a very small extent.   In the West Midlands,  for instance, 243 firms have in all brought only 40&apos; apprentices under the scheme.   The  matter, therefore, has recently been taken up with  the  Joint  Industrial Council for the industry.  The Chief Local Officer  for the West Midlands attended  a recent meeting of  the Council, when the subject was fully discussed, and a small sub-committee was appointed to go into the whole matter and make recommendations.    Difficulty is being experienced in the clothing industry at Leeds in providing for some of the apprentices.   The  industry  appears to be over-supplied with journeymen and apprentices.  The position is further complicated by seasonal fluctuations.    In the cooperage industry of the West Midlands the prevailing custom of paying the journeyman an amount which includes  his apprenticed  wages, has led to hesitation in applying the scheme.  A recent  case at an important brewery/however, has been decided in favour of the scheme and of the apprentice.    Messrs. Scotts&apos; Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd., Greenock, have accepted their own apprentices under the scheme, but refuse to bring under it a man formerly employedby a firm at  Peebles, who applied to them by reason of their excellent reputation fortraining.  He was informed that he could not receive the same  benefits as  their ownapprentices, but that, if he showed ability, his short period of army service would be countedtowards his apprenticeship.  He accepted these conditions, but complained subsequently of the firm&apos;s refusal to bring him under the  scheme.   The firm are determined not to altertheir decision.    (B 16312)                                                             2 B
Apprentices and Boys-continued.    Non-Observance. A number of firms in various districts, who have brought apprenticesunder the scheme, have failed subsequently to submit any claims for repayment of Stategrant.   In view of the fact, therefore,  that  such inaction might conceal failure to  paythe stipulated wages or other breaches of their agreement, inquiries  have been instituted.The results so far received do not indicate any general failure on the part of such firms to carry out their obligations.   In Wales and the  West Midlands most of the firms visitedin this  connection are paying the wages required, and in the latter area some  of the mare paying even more.  Some Welsh firms, however, had not increased the wages of thosewho are still receiving apprentices&apos;  rates by the amount of a recent award.    The continued  refusal to carry out  their agreements by Messrs.  Gullachsen and  Cc,Newcastle-on-Tyne, furniture manufacturers, has had an amusing sequel.  They professedthemselves to be unable to make  out their claim  forms unaided.   Eventually they called in a firm of chartered accountants  for the purpose,  by whom they were presented with a billfor twenty guineas ; and this they presented in their turn to the local officer on the occasion of a further visit.    Training in Operation: Progress. At a  recent inspection in the Barnstaple  district the training was found to be excellent with one exception.   Local headquarters write thatin many instances,  owing to the  absence  of  machines, it is above  the  average ; in thefurniture industry, for instance, many apprentices are employed on making furniture fromrough sawn timber without the aid of any machine tools.  Even where machine productionprevails in this industry the difficulty is  overcome by arranging for the execution of smallorders by the apprentices by hand under skilled supervision.  In such cases the additional cost is  reported to be more than  counterbalanced by the increased usefulness  of  theapprentices on the completion of their training.    The Ardrossan Dry Dock and  Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., are giving their apprentices everychance of becoming fully qualified craftsmen,  and, as the firm do both new construction and repairs, the opportunities for training seem to be above the average.  At Batley theapprentices of the co-operative society are giving satisfaction and apparently making good progress.  Three of them  are acting temporarily  as managers ot branch shops and with success.    Unemployment and Suspensions. In Cornwall short time is being worked in  variousplaces in the engineering industry, with the result that apprentices under the scheme are having to stand of.  At Glasgow  shortage of material has caused difficulty at three of theworks of the North British Locomotive Co., Ltd.  There are in these works about 250apprentices under the scheme,  who have now to be  suspended in batches  for alternateweeks.  Local headquarters have suggested to the company, therefore, that they should set aside part of the works for special intensive training.   This is to be  considered afterthe holidays.  A similar suggestion was favourably considered by Messrs. Bow, M&apos;Lachlanand Co., Ltd., Paisley, engineers,  earlier in the summer, but it proved unnecessary to put it into application.    At Lincoln Messrs. Ruston and Hornby, Ltd., have had to dismiss or suspend a numberof men and boys, but have given instructions  that no apprentices under the scheme are tobe discharged unless it is absolutely impossible to provide them with work.                             GENERAL TRAINING.Apprentices: Conditions and Training.    Interchange of Apprentices. The Liverpool secretary of the Lancashire and CheshireWeighing Machinists&apos; Association calls attention to the present impossibility in many shopsof giving boys an all-round training, owing to the  extended specialisation and sub-divisionof modern  industry.  He, therefore, regards  it as necessary, if a boy is to receive suchtraining, that he shall  serve his apprenticeship, with  two&apos;or more employers engaged indifferent branches of his trade.    Lesson Sheets for Apprentices : Vehicle Building.-Jt is proposed that the journal of theNational Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders shall include in future numbers what are termed lesson sheets for apprentices.  The aim of these will be to deal in turn withthe construction of different parts  of a vehicle in all their stages.  The articles will be fullyillustrated and will explain the exact method of  doing each job.  A start will be madewith the wheelwrights&apos; work.   The sheets  will be detachable from the journal,  so thatthey can easily be distributed to  apprentices.  The experiment is being made because inmost localities technical classes or schools dealing with the industry are wanting, and the employer has-very little time to give proper instruction to his apprentices.

INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.             JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS : REPORTS. Industrial.    Scottish Bahers-A difficult situation has. arisen at Montrose.   The operatives of acertain firm struck work without notice, and the result was a general lock-out of unionmen, leading to the formation of a new local union among the non-union men called the&quot; Society of Operative Bakers in Montrose.&quot; With this society the master bakers formed a joint committee, and a local agreement as to hours and wages was drawn up on differentlines from those  of the national working  agreement. The annual  delegate  meeting ofthe Operative Bakers and Confectioners of Scotland National Federal Union have entereda vigorous protest against  this action as  a violation of  the  working agreement.  Theposition has been aggravated by the Press referring to the new joint committee as a joint industrial Council.

     Building. The Resettlement Committee met on the 21st July, and completed their report, which will be submitted to the Council on the 12th and 13th August.  This report deals chiefly with the question of the distribution of contracts, and includes, correspondence with the  Ministry of Health on the subject.   The scheme  for adult apprenticeship put forward by Mr.  Thompson, of Louth, has been approved and incorporated in the report. A resolution was adopted protesting against the payment  of bonuses and the offer to building  trade operatives of  special inducements other than those provided for by the district working rule agreements.  It is urged that as these practices set up harmful competition for  the existing supply of labour,  prohibitive powers should be sought, and that the works concerned should be closed down until working rule agreements are strictly followed.     The  Management  and Costs  Committee met on the 22nd July, and  discussed the proposed scheme of insurance against wet time with the actuary and officials of the Ministry. A memorandum  was drawn up for presentation to the Council, which, incidentally, stated that the  committee are of the opinion that the total unemployment under this head to be provided against will be approximately 4-5  per cent, for a year of 275 working days. As a safe basis 5  per cent, will be regarded as the total liability.  It is hoped that a stamp of 3s. will cover all liabilities which the fund will be expected to meet.     Electrical Cable Making.-kt a meeting on the  21st July it was  reported that in response to the application of the trade unions for an  advance of 15s. to  men over 18, and 7s. Gd. to juniors, the Negotiating Committee had offered 5s. to men, and 2s. to women.     The  unions  regarded this  offer  as inadequate, and had decided to ballot  all the operatives in the works of firms belonging to the cable-making association on the question of a strike. The Council will meet on the 18th August,  when the  result of the ballot will be reported.  A joint committee was appointed to examine the provisions of the Women, Young Persons and  Children  (Employment) Bill.  A sub-committee  was appointed to draw up a draft constitution for works committees.     Glass.-The sub-committee of the Council appointed to consider the Women,  Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill met on the 22nd July,  to consider the Bill as amended in Standing Committee.  In view of the important changes made in the measure during the committee stage, the secretary was instructed to  request the Home Secretary to receive  a deputation at an early date.     Local  Authorities&apos; Non-Trading  Services, Manual  Workers (England and  Wales).  The District Council for the Midland area met  on the 16th  July  to consider further the application from the trade union  side for an advance of 6s. per  week, and the putting into operation of the National Council&apos;s recommendation of  1.2 days&apos; holiday per annum with pay.  A sub-committee was  appointed to  prepare  a temporary grading scheme for the area, and it was decided that the application for an increase of wages be  considered when the  sub-committee had reported.  No agreement  was reached with regard  to holidays.   The executive committee of the District Council for Kent, Surrey, East Sussex and West  Sussex met on the  20th  and 23rd  July.  It was reported  that considerable progress had been made with a grading scheme for the whole area, and that recommendations would  be  made to the District Council on  the 27th July.  The District Council for the South Midland area met on the 23rd July, and considered the draft constitution for works committees prepared by the National Council.    Printing.-On the  16th,  17th and 22nd July  the  Council considered the position created by the Liverpool and Manchester branches of the Typographical Association refusing to accept the 10s. advance in wages&apos;offered by the employers, and accepted by the executives of all the trade unions in the industry, including the Typographical Association, after taking ballot votes.  At the first two meetings it was decided that the  executive council of  the Association should  instruct the fathers of the Liverpool and Manchester chapels, over the  heads of the  branch executives, to direct ali members to resume normal working conditions and obey the instruction of the central executive.  By the 18th July it  was known that  the Liverpool  and Manchester members  had  not complied with the instructions of their executive, and the meeting of the Council on the 22nd July was  called to consider what  further action should be  recommended.  It was finally agreed by the Council, and accepted by the union executive, that the latter should send a circular letterto every member  of the association in Liverpool and Manchester,  again instructing themto obey the central  executive  and return to normal working conditions,  and.warningthem that  in the  event  of refusal they would be deprived of all benefits, and that work would be carried on in the district under the authority of the central executive by those
 who accepted  these instructions.   All  the  other unions agreed to co-operate  with  the employers and the members of the Typographical Association who are loyal to the central executive, and to  keep all printing offices at work in the affected districts.     Quarrying. A meeting of the Yorkshire District Council  ot the Freestone Section was held on the 12th July.  Working hours for the industry were fixed at 48 for six months of the year, and 44 for the remaining six ; and overtime rate at time-and-a-half. It was decided to elect a  G-rading Committee which will classify the various areas.  A deputation from the  District  Council will urge certain associations of quarry owners who  are outside the Council to pay the increase of 4d. per hour agreed upon at the last meeting.     Soap and Candles. At a meeting of the Council on the 22nd July the workers&apos; repre- sentatives complained that the settlement made on the 16th June was not being carried out  by Messrs. Lever  Bros., Ltd.,  and Messrs.  J. Watson &amp; Sons, Ltd.  The  principal complaints were that men who had been taken back  had not been restored  to  their  old positions,  and that there had been victimisation in respect of holiday dates.  After discussion the employers met separately, and made a reply that though most of the points could be adjusted by the firms, who for this purpose would seek the help of  trade union representatives, yet the firms would not agree that men who had abused positions of trust should be restored to those positions.  The workpeople considered the reply unsatisfactory, and  are to meet to decide on further action.     Tin Mining. On the 21st July a deputation headed by the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall  waited upon the President  of the Board of Trade to ask the Government to assist the industry by  subscribing capital.   Sir Robert Home, on behalf of the Govern- ment, declined to give any financial assistance.     Waterworks Undertakings.-Th.e District Council  for the Midland area  met on  the 20th July to consider lurther  an application from the trade union side for an advance of 6s. per week.  The Grading  Committee  were instructed to take the  application into consideration during their deliberations.  The District Council for the Eastern  area met on the 22nd July. A Grading and Basic Rate Committee was appointed.   Application for increases in wages submitted to several undertakings in the area were approved, pending the  completion of the grading scheme.  An adjourned meeting of the Council  was held on the 23rd July.  The  report of a committee appointed to consider the report of  the Departmental Committee on Superannuation made certain recommendations  with regard to the proposed scheme.  These recommendations were adopted  and  ordered to be for- warded to the  Ministry of Health.  Various matters referred to the Council  for decision by District Councils who had been unable to reach agreement were considered and settled. The  relation of the National Council to  the District Councils was discussed and the  trade union side gaVe notice that they would raise the question of amending the constitution in this  respect.       JOINT  STANDING INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS :  WORKS COMMITTEES.     Flour  Milling. In pursuance  of the  negotiations for the establishment  of works committees on  the lines suggested by the Council, meetings of the Joint District Councils for Kent, the North-Western Area and the Birmingham and West Midlands Area, and  the West of England Flour Milling Employers&apos; Association, have been  addressed on the  scope and  functions  of works  committees.  While generally in favour  of the principle, they are leaving the formation of works committees  to individual discretion.   Copies of  the constitution for works  committees adopted by. the Council have been sent to each mill. Arrangements are  being made to address a meeting of the District Council for  the East Midlands area.  A meeting of the Edinburgh branch of the Workers&apos; Union was in favour of works committees, but the  chairman in his remarks stated that he wished to impress on the Ministry the necessity for providing the Council with statutory powers to enforce their decisions.  Visits to the Ponders End Mills, Middlesex, Messrs. Samuel Kidd &amp; Co., Ltd., Isleworth, the Albert Bridge Mills,  Battersea, Messrs. Mark Mayhew, Ltd., Battersea, and Messrs. Buchanan&apos;s Flour Mills, Birkenhead, disclosed the fact that works committeeshad been set up in accordance with  recommendations of the Council, and had been giving much satisfaction  to both employers and  workpeople.     Gold,  Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. The negotiations for the establishment of joint works committees in this industry have been continued and officials of the LondonSociety  of  Goldsmiths  and Jewellers,  and the Sheffield Master  Silversmiths&apos;  Associationhave  been  interviewed.

The Institutions Committee met to considerthe question of the application ot the Trade Boards Acts to institutional laundries, anda representative of the Home Office was present at the consultation.  The committee agreedto defer further consideration of the matter until their next meeting, but in the meantimememoranda are to be prepared formulating a scheme for the introduction ot a system forthe payment of workers in institutional laundries based on hourly  rates, and on thestatutory provisions for the inspection of reformatory and industrial schools and similarcharitable institutions.    Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales). The first, meeting of theBoard was held on the 20th and 21st July.   Proposals for general minimum time-rates formale and female workers in the trade, except vehicle workers, were put forward by theworkers&apos; representatives.  The matter was  adjourned until the next meeting on the 28thAugust.    Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain).-The Administrative committee agreed that a representative from the Juvenile Branch should be invited to attend a meetingof the  Board.    At a meeting of the Board a deputation was appointed to interview the Minister onthe subject of the amendment of the regulations governing the constitution and procedure of the Board so as to provide for voting by sides.  The deputation was received by Mr. H.Wolfe,  who explained the grounds on which the Minister  had decided that he  could notat present grant the request of the Board.  The members of the deputation were requestedto report  the Ministers  views to their respective sides.   If, on  further  consideration,the Board were unanimously of opinion that the regulations should be amended theycould then have an interview with the Minister.    Pottery-It has been decided  to proceed with the formation of works committees at the works of Messrs.  Wild Bros., Messrs. Edwards and Brown, Messrs. Wildblood,Heath &amp; Sons,  Ltd., and Messrs. Blackhurst &amp; Hulme of Longton.  A  constitution hasbeen adopted by Messrs. Wild Bros.  Messrs. C. C. Wright, Messrs. T. Barlow &amp; Son,Messrs.  Colclough &amp; Son,  and Messrs. Amison &amp; Co., are considering the  formation ofworks committees.    Rubber.-k&amp; a result of previous visits, the Amalgamated Society of India Rubber,Cable and Asbestos  Workers,  Manchester,  have unanimously decided to render everysupport in the  formation of  works committees in the area.  The formation of workscommittees is being considered by the New Eccles Rubber Co., Ltd., Eccles, and Messrs. F.Reddaway &amp; Co., Ltd., Pendleton.    Silk. The  Leek Manufacturers and Dyers&apos;  Association discussed  the question forming works committees at their recent meeting, but owing to pressure of other business,a decision was not reached, and the matter is held over.      INTERIM  INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION  COMMITTEES; REPORTS.    Making-up  and  Packing of Textiles.-ThQ annual meeting of the Committee was heldon the 14th July, when it was decided that in view of the fact that the present Committeecovers only London and Manchester and that attempts to secure the co-operation of other centres of the industry had failed, very little useful work could be done except by the Londonand Manchester District Committees acting separately.   The constitution  of the Com-mittee was amended accordingly to provide only for annual  meetings except when speciallyconvened on a  specific question of  common interest.    Paper Making. Negotiations for increased wages in the industry  have reached a deadlock and application has been  made to the Ministry for a single arbitrator to settle the points in dispute.

Trade  Boards Division-continued.     Hollow-wave Trade  Board.-T]ie Trade Board considered the overtime provisions oftheir Notices, dated the 11th  March and the 17th April,  proposing to  vary minimum rates, and after hearing a representative of the Ministry decided to amend these provisions,the employers having given an undertaking to carry out the  original provisions voluntarily.It was decided that, in the event of their  amendments being regarded as within the termsof the Proposal, they should be incorporated forthwith in  the Notice about to be issuedvarying rates, but that if Notice  of Proposal to fix overtime rates on the new basis was required, such Notice should at once be given and the varying Notice confined to the ratesother than the overtime rates.     The Board decided, on a suggestion from the Pin, Hook and Eye, and Snap FastenerTrade Board (Great Britain) to ask the Minister to introduce amending legislation to givepower to the Board to fix overtime rates  on any basis they desired.     Button-Making  Trade Board  (Great Britain). The Board, after  considering the twoobjections lodged to their  Notice  of Proposal to fix minimum  rates for home  workers,fixed the rates as proposed,* and  suggested the 14th August as the date from  which theyshould  become effective.  The Board appointed  a  committee to consider and report onthe question of rates for women employed on men&apos;s work, and the provision of  rest-rooms.           FIXING  AND VARIATION  OF  MINIMUM RATES  OF  WAGES.     Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order,dated the 10th July, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-ratesand overtime rates as varied for certain classes of male workers in Great Britain, excludingDorset  and  Somerset,  and  general minimum time-rates,  general minimum  piece-rates,piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates as varied and fixed for certain classes of male and female workers in Dorset and  Somerset.   He has  specified the 16th July as thedate  from which these minimum  rates  of wages  become effective.           The general minimum time-rates as varied for male workers in the trade, except in Dorset and        Somerset, are as follows :-           Workers 21 years of age and over, of not less than three years&apos; experience  in  any  branch  of        the trade, who are employed as charge-hands, rope-layers, rope-formers (when in charge of a rope-walk        and engaged in the making of ropes of 1\ inches  circumference and upwards), hand line walk rat-        liners, hemp breakers, walk line makers, and transmission rope slicers, Is.

Trade Boards Division-continued,            The overtime rates for the classes of male workers, and for the classes of male and female workers,        specified above have been varied correspondingly,            The overtime rates for male workers employed on piece-work in hand hackling are  for overtime        on any day except Saturday, Sunday and customary public and statutory  holidays, the appropriate        general minimum piece-rate plus  (a) for the first two hours one quarter of the general minimum time-        rate ;  and (b) after the first two hours one half of this rate.  For all overtime on Saturday the        appropriate piece-rate plus one-half of the general minimum time-rate, and for all time worked on        Sunday and customary public and  statutory holidays the  sum of  the applicable minimum piece-        rate and the general minimum time-rate.     Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.e Minister has made an Order dated the 14thJuly,  confirming  general minimum time-rates and  overtime rates  as  varied for male and female workers in the trade, and he  has specified  the 19th July,  1920, as the date fromwhich these  rates become effective.            The general minimum time-rates as varied are 61s. Gd. per week of 48 hours for male workers        21 years of age and upwards, and 38s.J Gd. per week of 48  hours for female workers 21 years of age        and upwards, with  correspondingly lower rates for  younger male and female workers.            The overtime rates are as follows,  and apply to workers whether employed on time-work, or on        piece-work : Time-and-a-quarter in respect of all hours worked in any week in excess of 48 hours,        except in so far as higher overtime  rates are  payable, namely, double time in respect of all hours        worked on Sunday  and on customary  public and statutory holidays.            For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of        work to be  48 in any week.     Laundry Trade  Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal,dated the 19th  July, to  vary the general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates,guaranteed time-rates and overtime rates for female workers.   The principal variationsproposed  are as follows :             General minimum time-rates, from 28s. per week to 35s.  per week (Scale A), and to 30s. per week        (Scale B), for workers 18 years of  age and over, with corresponding variations in the rates for younger        workers.  For female workers specially employed  for emergency work or  whose employment is of        a casual nature the variations proposed in the general minimum time-rate are from Id. per hour for        workers under 18 years of age to 8fd. per hour (Scale A), and to l\d. per hour (Scale B), and from        l\d. per hour for workers  18  years of age  and over to %\d.  per hour (Scale A), and to Sd. per hour        (Scale B).

Guaranteed time-rates for piece-workers from  24s. per week to  30s. per week (Scale A), and to        25s. per week (Scale B), for workers 18 years of age  and  over, with corresponding variations in the        rates for younger workers.            Overtime rates  for time-workers, from 8fd. per hour to  lid. per hour (Scale A), and to d^d. per        hour (Scale B), for ordinary workers 18 years of age and over ; and from 8fd!. per hour to lid. per hour        (Scale A), and to 9\d. per hour (Scale B) for workers under  18 years of age ; and from %d. per hour       -to ll\d. per hour (Scale A), and  to lOd per hour (Scale B),  for workers 18  years of age and over, in        the case of female workers specially employed for emergency work, or whose employment is of a casual        nature.            The weekly rates are  for a week of 48 hours and, except in certain circumstances specified by        the Board, no deductions are  to be made where the number  of hours worked in any week is less than        48.  Overtime rates are payable  in respect of all hours worked in excess of 48 per week, or of 5 on        Saturdays.                                                            ^            Scale A rates are to apply to the area comprised within a radius  of 30 miles from Charing Cross,        and Scale B rates to all other areas in Great  Britain.     Chain Trade  Board  (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, datedthe 19th July, to vary the general  minimum time-rates for hand-hammered chain makingfrom 7j(L to Sid.  per hour for journeymen,  and  trom  lOd.  to lljd. per hour for master-men  as from 1st October.     They also propose to vary the  minimum rates now in operation for dollied or tommiedand hand-hammered chain making  by extending the period of operation of these  rates  fora further period from the 1st October, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921, inclusive.     Corset Trade Board (Great  Britain).-Th.e Board  have issued a Notice ot Proposal,dated the 21st July, to vary  the general minimum  time-rates, piece-work basis time-ratesand overtime rates  for male and female workers in the  trade.            The general minimum time-rates proposed are 9 $. per hour for female workers other than learners,        and Is. 3fd!. per hour for  male workers of 22 years of age and over, other than those employed on        certain specified branches of work, for which general minimum time-rates ranging from Is.  i\d. to        Is. 9rZ. per hour are proposed, according to the class of work&apos; and the experience of the  worker.        Variations are also proposed in the rates for female learners and for male  workers other than those        engaged in the  specified occupations referred to above, under 22 years of age.
Trade Boards  Division--continued.          The piece-work basis time-rates proposed are lOfrf. per hour for female workers, and Is. M. per       hour for male workers other than those engaged in the specified occupations referred to above, for       which the proposed piece-work basis time-rates range from Is. 6d. to Is. lO^d. per hour.          The Board propose  to vary the overtime rate correspondingly.    Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland).- he Board have issued a Notice of proposal dated the 21st July, to  vary and fix.minimum rates of wages for certain classesof male workers.  The general minimum time-rate proposed for  male workers who have completed four years&apos; apprenticeship or learnership in the trade is Is. Id. per hour, and thepiece-work basis time-rate proposed for these classes of  male workers is Is. S^d. per hour.

AWARDS.     The number of awards issued during the week was fifteen, thirteen under the Industrial Courts Act, one  under the Wages (Temporary Regulation)  Acts, as modified by the Industrial Courts Act, and one by a single arbitrator. Industrial Court.     Steam  Service Men (Sheffield and District). The  National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen,  Mechanics,  Motormen  and Electrical Workers pressed that Award No. 84  should be annulled and  that former conditions  should be maintained  whereby steam service men should have a normal working week of 47 hours with the engineering trade  conditions in regard to overtime.  The Court saw  no reason to depart from their view that the men concerned should be placed on the three-shift system with the conditions applicable thereto.  (Award No.  389.)     Textile Workers (West of Scotland). An advance was granted of. 15 per cent, on time rates to tape-dressers and beamers, and of.20 per cent, to the other workers concerned, from. and including the pay period for which payment was made in the  week ending the 12th June.   (Award No. 379.)     Railway Shopmen (National). It was held that claims for advances had not been established.  (Award No. 400.)     Lead and Zinc Mine Workers (National). An advance was granted of Is. per shift, or 6s. per week, and half this amount to youths under 18 years of age.  (Award  No. 402.)     Woollen Trade Workers (Scotland). The existing increases over pre-war wages granted to time-workers were raised from  32s. to 38s.  for men, and from 24s. to 28s. for women. The increase on the flat statement for weaving  was raised to 120 per cent. Rates for young persons and night shift workers were fixed and working conditions indicated.     Railway Shops&apos; Employees. A claim for an advance of 10s. per week to women, girls and boys in railway shops was held not to have been established.   (Award No. 407.)                       AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.     Corporation Workers (Sheffield). At a meeting on the 20th July between represen- tatives of the Corporation and of the building  trades federation, an agreement was reached providing that craftsmen employed on the  Ewden  Valley works and in the Corporation workshops should be paid the building trade rates, the hours of labour  to be the same as those of  other men employed at these places.   It was further agreed that the  remaining points of difference, the claim for building trade rates for navvies and labourers employed at the Ewden Valley, and for street masons and paviors, and the question of retrospective pay for craftsmen, should be referred to an ad hoc Court of Arbitration consisting of threepersons,  one to  be nominated by the Corporation, one by the federation and a  neutral chairman to be appointed by the department. It is understood that work was resumedon the  23rd July.    (B 16312)                                                              2 C
                     QUESTIONS PENDING AND  MISCELLANEOUS.     Furniture Workers (Leeds). Following upon a visit by representatives of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades&apos; Association  and the Amalgamated Society  of Wood- cutting Machinists to the Chief Conciliation Officer, Leeds, the secretary of the Leeds Employers&apos; Federation of Furnishing Trades was  sounded as to the federation^ views on the question of a joint  conference being called.  The secretary stated that the offer of 2s. 2d.  per hour for a 46-1-hour week was the utmost the federation could  give, and that if the men were not prepared to accept this it  was useless to call a conference.   The position of the  employers is strengthened by the fact that the state  of the trade in the furniture industry in Yorkshire is at present very unsatisfactory.     Shoe,  Rivet and Wire Nail Makers (Birmingham). Tool makers, numbering  about 90, who belong to the  Shoe, Rivet and Wire Nail Makers&apos; Association went on strike on the 10th July, after giving fourteen days&apos; notice, on  the refusal of the employers to increase their rate  from 3s. Qd. per machine, plus  50 per cent., plus 8s.  Qd. per week  bonus, to 3s.  Qd. per machine, plus 100 per cent., plus 8s. Qd. per week bonus.   The Chief Concilia- tion Officer, Birmingham, reports that the employers consider that the claim is exorbitant and that they are not willing to enter into negotiations, particularly as business is very slack.     Council Employees (Cardigan). The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General  Workers&apos; Union, made a claim for an increase of 13s. per week on the existing rate of 42s. for roadmen in  order that their wages  should equal those paid by the Carmarthen County Council. The demand was refused, and about  150 roadmen struck on the  5th July.   The Council state that as Cardigan is purely agricultural any increase would cause dissatisfaction among the agricultural labourers.  They refuse to meet  the union officials.  The Chief Conciliation Officer has made every effort to bring about a joints  conference, but the Council state that nothing can be done before their next meeting  on the 4th August.  At a meeting of the Finance  Committee, it was resolved  to instruct the surveyor to fill the strikers&apos; places with outside labour at the old rate, but the Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to dissuade the Council from taking this course of action, as it is likely to lead to sympathetic action by  other sections  represented by the union.     Woollen  Trade Dispute. Since the adjournment  sine die of the Wool  (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council, the operatives&apos; organisations have held ballots on the employers&apos; offer of 26f per cent, advance on basic rates.   Certain union leaders have suggested the desirability of a public inquiry into the whole question, but no official opinion  has  been expressed by the employers on the matter.   The department have invited a small deputa- tion from  each  side to discuss the position separately in  informal interviews  at head- quarters.     White  Marl  Workers (Staffordshire). The employers remain  firm in their refusal to enter into  any negotiations to  increase the wages of  the workers,* and decline to meet the  operatives&apos;  union.  The Chief  Conciliation Officer is  keeping in touch with both parties.     Woodcutting  Machinists (London).-Whs employers have refused to go to arbitration on the grounds that they have offered rates, 2s. to benchmen, and Is. Id. to others, already accepted by the union for the packing-case trade.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, is taking this point up with the union.     Woodcutting  Machinists (Scotland).-Following  upon an agreement between repre- sentatives  of the Scottish Timber Merchants&apos; and Sawmillers&apos; Association and the wood- cutting machinists, representatives of  the  packing case makers&apos; associations  and  the Amalgamated  Society of  Woodcutting Machinists met at a conference on the 20th July,under  the  chairmanship  of  the  Chief Conciliation  Officer,  Glasgow, and arrived at anagreement which the Society undertook to recommend to the workers on the understandingthat work  would be resumed immediately.  The  agreement provides  for an advance of2d.  per hour on existing rates to journeymen, a minimum rate of  Is. lid. per hour, untilthe 1st October, increased on that date to 2s. per hour, to remain in operation  until the30th November, and an advance of  l\d. per hour  on the existing rates of apprentices.The Aberdeen  association are not party to the agreement.    Building Trade  (Cornwall). In connection with the formation of the Cornwall CountyBuilding  Trade Employers&apos;  Federation, trouble has been experienced in persuading thecraft unions&apos; representatives to meet the employers, together with the unskilled unions&apos;                     * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 3, page 125.
 representatives.  The craft unions intended to force the South Western Area grading on the whole of Cornwall, and later fell back on a demand to uphold the grading in the four towns which were previously included under the Area Scheme.     The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives claim to include about 75 per cent, of the skilled workers and 50 per cent, of the unskilled.     At a conference on the 26th June the operatives proposed the following rates :-Is. Id. per hour at Falmouth from the 1st May ; Is.  Id. per hour throughout the county from the 26th June;  Is. Sd. per hour throughout the county from the 1st August.   They also suggested that  negotiations  should take place before the  1st- September  on  a proposed rate of Is. 9d. for the county.   The employers agreed to the first two proposals, and offered the operatives a rate of Is. Sd. from the 1st September  throughout the county.  No definite agreement was made.     The Chief Conciliation Officer, Bristol, met the executive committee of the Cornwall County  Building Trade  Employers&apos; Association on the  17th  July.  He  found that the building trades  operatives at Falmouth had agreed to accept Is. Id. as from the 1st May, and Is.  Sd. on the fst September. In other districts the men had practically agreed to accept the same terms.  It is now  arranged that the Association will call a general meeting representative of all towns in the county with a view to re-affirming the offer of Is. Sd. to skilled tradesmen as from the 1st September.     Another question which will be considered by the Association is the relation of the rates of labourers to those of mechanics.  The present feeling is that there is not sufficient margin.   The building trade rates for labourers at Falmouth are to  some extent controlled by the labourers&apos; rates in the  local engineering shops, which  in some cases are Is. lOd. per hour.  In other districts, such as Redruth and Camborne, it is easy to get labourers for the building trade, because unskilled men employed in  the tin  mines are getting only lOd. or lOjdL per hour.     Glass  Workers  (Castleford).-The members of the United  (Machine) Glass Bottle Makers&apos;  Society employed by  Messrs. John Lumb &amp; Co.,  Ltd., Castleford, have struck in support of their refusal to accept the recent Award of the  Industrial Court, No. 385. The firm had previously met the union committee, and learnt that  the men were dis- satisfied, because the award granted no advance to packers, and the firm would not agree that it  was applicable to takers-in and takers-out, who are boys.   The firm agreed that the packers had a  case for an increase, but  refused to discuss with the committee any departure from the Award, being apprehensive lest the union might desire to reopen the whole question.   They have referred the committee to the Industrial Court on the question of the takers-in and takers-out.  This is the second lightning strike at the firm&apos;s works within a few months.  About 700  employees are idle.     Basket-Makers  (Yorkshire).-The Yorkshire United Skip, Basket and Hamper Makers&apos; Society have approached the employers for a further increase of 25 per cent, in wages, and have stated that unless a settlement is reached before the 24th July the men will strike on that day.   The operatives expect to meet the employers again before the notices expire.     Garment  Vyorhrs (Newcastle-on-Tyne).-A strike of members  of the Amalgamated Tailors&apos;  and Garment Workers&apos; Union, employed  by Messrs. Fenwick, Ltd.,  Newcastle- on-Tyne, has been  reported by the Chief Conciliation Officer.  The dispute arose from a claim made by the union for the payment of Is. 2d. per hour to their members, 18 years of age and  over,  and an increase of 25 per cent, to those under 18.  It is understood that the firm are paying the minimum Trade Board rates as laid down in the Mantle and Costume and Retail Bespoke  Tailoring  Trade Orders, but in certain  cases where  the girls  are especially  proficient they  are paying a higher rate.   Owing to the slackness in trade, and also to the fact that a large number of girls are anxious to take up this class of work, the firm state that  they  can readily dispense  with  the services of these girls.  They have hitherto been unwilling to meet the union.  The  Chief Conciliation Officer is  taking no- further action at present, but the matter is being kept under observation.     Bakers (Armadale).-k strike of  bakers   employed by the Armadale Co-operative Society occurred on the 10th July on the questionof female labour employed inthebakehouse. In January the society made an  agreement with the union to the effect that the three women then employed by them should be put into a  small bakehouse by themselves and employed in the production of a lighter class of goods.   This conformed with the                     * See this  Report, Vol.  II,  No. 1, 3rd July, p. 34.     (B 16312)                                                            2 C 2
agreement reached by the Scottish Bakers&apos; Joint Industrial Council to the effect that wherewomen were employed in bakehouses before the War they  should  continue to be  so employed, but where they were engaged during the War they must be replaced by men.Early  in July one of the three women employed by the Armadale Co-operative Societyleft, and  was replaced by another woman.  The operatives contended that this was a violation of their agreement, which the Society disputed, and the strike accordingly tookplace to insist upon the dismissal of  the newly  appointed  woman.   A joint conference was held  on the 22nd  July arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer,  Glasgow, but no progress was made, and the strike still continues.  The Scottish Bakers&apos; Joint IndustrialCouncil are  meeting to consider the general question  of female labour, and the secretary is to be informed of this case in order that it may be specially considered.     Bakers  (London).-The Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers,  Confectionersand Allied Workers have applied for an increase in wages of 8s. per week for their members,employed in the  London area, in order to bring the minimum rate up to  4 per week.   Aconference with  the employers was held at which no settlement w.as reached, and thedepartment have now been requested to take the matter up.    Boot Last Makers (Midlands).-k  conference  was held on the 23rd July between theboot last  manufacturers  and the  Workers&apos; Union to consider the threatened strike  inNorthampton, Leicester and Kettering.  The employers maintained their attitude that,owing  to the present state of the boot and shoe trade, no advance could be given to lastmakers.  A ballot of the operatives was taken in each  of the three  towns mentioned ;Leicester and Northampton the result  was overwhelmingly in favour of a strike, but themajority of the Kettering employees refused to vote.   The aggregate Voting gave a large majority for a stoppage of work, and the union are now considering the question of handingin strike notices.    Clothiers (London). Representatives of Messrs. Thexton &amp; Wright, Ltd., and of theirworkpeople have again been interviewed by an officer  ot the department.  The employers are insistent that  the  workpeople shall accept the piece-rate system.  The workpeopleare determined not to  depart from the present system of time-work.   The executive  ofthe union will reconsider the whole  position, and will inform the department of the lineof action determined upon.    Laundry General Workers (General). Representatives of launderers and of the NationalFederation of Women Workers and the  National Union of General Workers have calledand discussed the various disputes  in the laundry trade.  The position  appears to bethat in Hull, owing to delay in dealing with their application for an increase in wages, themembers  of the  National Federation  of Women Workers withdrew  their labour.  TheConciliation Officer has been  in communication with the parties but negotiations havebeen somewhat prolonged owing to the absence of the launderers&apos; industrial commissioner,on holiday.   The federation now request the department to re-open negotiations betweenthe parties and to arrange a conference for discussion of the points at issue.  The department are in  communication with the Launderers&apos; Association on the matter.    The National  Federation  of Women Workers and the  Amalgamated Union  of Co-operative  and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers have members involved in thedispute in Manchester where a claim for an advance of 3s. Qd. has been made.  The parties are still in negotiation and it  is understood that the employers have recently made an offer of 35s. per  week for the women workers.    The department have been informed by the National Amalgamated Union of labour that there is a strong element of discontent among the workers in the domestic laundriesin Liverpool, which, it is stated, is due to the fact that advances have been given to laundryworkers in the shipping laundries  in the area.  The department are communicating withthe launderers&apos; industrial commissioner.    In the Sheffield district members of the Workers&apos; Union and of the National Federationof Women Workers are affected.  A claim has been made  for  2 per week for women workers over 21  years of age.  The employers have offered 33s. and 21s., for women and girls, respectively.  This offer has been refused.  A further meeting of  the employees concerned is to  take place.

APPENDIX.                          QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.    The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House ofCommons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.                     &apos;      &apos; -                                                 II&apos;: &apos;;Disabled Ex-Service Men (Oldham).    Mr. W. Greenwood asked the Minister of Labour if all disabled ex-Service  men inOldham have been found employment; and which other towns or cities have a like record.    Dr. Macnamara: Through the  courtesy of my hon.  friend,  I  have been  enabled to read the&apos; record of the Oldham Corporation.  There are now no disabled ex-Service menresiding in Oldham on the live register of the Oldham Employment Exchange, with theexception of one or two men who are undergoing treatment or training.  J: heartily com-mend the example of Oldham to other parts of the country.  I am sure my hon. friend willbe glad to know that in the case of seven other Employment Exchanges, namely, those atHarrow, Hebburn, Hebden. Bridge,  Neath, Sandycroft, Sheerness and Willington Quay,there are, I am advised, no disabled  men at this moment  registered as unemployed.  Butnotwithstanding  this, there still  remain some 22,000 disabled  men seeking employment,and I trust that  the sequel to the fine record of Oldham and the other places mentioned,may be the rapid  reduction and early disappearance from the ranks of the unemployedof the 22,000 men who are still registered at our Exchanges.- (22nd July.)Ministry of Labour and Employment Exchanges.    Major Gayzer asked the Minister of Labour the annual cost at the 1st January, 1919,of the upkeep  of the Ministry of Labour and the Labour Exchanges; and the estimatedannual cost of  che upkeep of these two Departments at the present day.    Dr. Macnamara : The cost of the Ministry of Labour  at the 1st January, 19.19, was atthe rate of  3,600,000 per annum ; of this total  3,000,000 wras attributable to the Employ-ment Department,  which  includes the administration of the Employment  Exchanges.The corresponding total as  estimated for the financial year  1920--21 is  5.250,000 for theMinistry of Labour, of which  3,750,000 is attributable to the Employment Department.The Employment Department performs a variety of services besides the  placing of men in work, namely,  the administration of the unemployment insurance benefit and out-of-workdonation.  All these figures include  the cost of services rendered, by other departments,namely, the Office of Works and Stationery Office.   Of the difference of  1,650,000 betweenthe totals for the two periods, about  1,285,000 is accounted for by increases  in rates ofwar bonus and rates of pay of temporary staff. (19th July.)Appointments  Department.    Mr. Remer asked the Minister  of Labour whether he will  consider  the  suggestion which has been made wdiereby the costly Horrex&apos;s Hotel administration shall be abolished and administered by Earl Haig&apos;s Officers&apos; Association, which would be also  staffed by service and ex-Service men.    Dr. Macnamara: The suggestion to which my hon. friend refers has  been discussed with the Officers&apos; Association, and it was not considered practicable, either by the Associa-tion or Joy myself, that they should take over the work of the Appointments department at the present  time.  By co-operation with the Association, however, we aim at securing that every effort may be concentrated and co-ordinated to  the fullest possible extent tofind openings for the men who have deserved so well of the nation. I may add that 99per cent, of the male staff of the Department is composed of ex-Service men. (23rd July.)
 Appendix continued.                            DEBATES  IN PARLIAMENT. Unemployment Insurance Bill.     The Bill was read for the  third time on the 19th July.     Mr. Chjnes, moving that the Bill be read on that day three months, said that it made no pretence at pre venting, unemployment, but simply aimed at reducing distress during unem- ployment.  The cost to the contributors would  be better spent in reorganising industry so ,as  to  secure continuity  of work.  On the question of the amendment of the strike proviso, he indicated that informal discussions with representatives of the employers had so far failed  to produce an  agreed formula, though he still hoped for success.  The chief objection of  the Labour Party was to  the contributory nature of  the scheme; during unemployment the workers should be maintained by the industry.  He dealt with  the admission of the friendly societies to the administration of the scheme ;  nothing would be more lamentable than that  a Statute should allow steps to be taken which would identify individual workers as non-unionists.  It would cause enormous friction  in the workshops, and would mean serious conflict in industries where  trade union organisation was in  its infancy.  Finally, the amount of benefit provided was niggardly.     Mr. Rose, seconding the motion, argued that the statistics on which the scheme was based  were highly uncertain and its finance unsafe.  Without a reserve of  50,000,000 the scheme would smash within twelve months, and without a prodigious  staff of inspectors, plundering would go on.  He believed that within two years there would be 20 per cent. of unemployment;  it was more than 20 per  cent, now in the unskilled industries.   The Bill should be withdrawn and a  more workable measure framed.     Sir Owen Philipps held that there  was a great scheme in the Bill,  and that if more money was wanted, this and future Parliaments would provide what was necessary.     Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy objected to the Bill on the ground of unequal treatment of the sexes,  and of the inadequate benefits provided.  Fear of unemployment lay behind the failure to produce, and  the Bill did nothing to remove it.  Labour ought to be  de- casualised.  In Germany the problem  was being attacked through Industrial  Councils, which were compulsory even in agriculture, and had statutory powers.   They divided the profits-of  the industry on a  recognised  basis,  and set aside a substantial reserve fund for maintaining the worker when not employed.  The present Bill would not work.     Mr. Sexton, dealing with the casual worker, urged that half a million men would pay contributions, but, through the operation of the waiting period, would receive no benefits. Decasualisation of dock labour was not possible.   The Bill ought to be non-contributory.    Dr. Macnamara, in reply, claimed that the Bill was a great step forward.  Agriculture and domestic service could be brought  in if desired ;  the rates of benefit had been raised and the waiting period reduced.   As regards the friendly societies, he had to see that any society taking up this agency for the Government was in a position to do so effectively ; he hoped that there would be no collision with the trade unions.  The workpeople would pay under  6,000,000  into a fund from  which they would be paid  14,000,000 in benefit.Well organised industries which  believed that they could deal more effectively with unem-ployment through their own machinery, were given the opportunity of trying.  He intended to look very sympathetically at suggestions for special schemes, if he was satisfied  thatthey were fair and financially sound.  A special scheme could be introduced to meet theposition of the casual workers.   He did  not suppose that the Bill was the last word on theproblem, but  he was satisfied that it deserved to receive the co-operation and  support  of all interests and of all those concerned.    Mr. Clynes&apos;s motion was rejected by 209 votes to 32,  and the Bill was passed.
