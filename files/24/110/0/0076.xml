SECRET.II III.. IW...K.K                    GOVERNMENT POOL OF MOTOR, CARS.             jtfflgAMPra FOR ,THE CABINET By.THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT.It     By Y/ar Cabinet 635 minute 9 of 27th October * 1919, Iwas authorised to take over the Pool of Motor Cars used for official purposes by Departments other than the fightingservices.2.    .The number of cars so employed at that date in theLondon area appears to have been over 70.   By January,1920, other departments, whose attention had been drawn to cabinet discussions, had reduced the number to approximately40.3.     On  12th January, 1920, I took over a Pool of 25, andthe total  cost of running  (excluding depreciation and interest on Capital) was for the first four weeks,  1,384.4.     The number of cars has now been reduced to thirteen,and for the last four weeks of July the total cost, similarlycalculated, has been  672.5.    i This material reduction has been due to two causes    (i) the rigid enforcement of  the Treasury regulations           limiting  the use of the cars to strictly official           journeys:   and   (ii) the use by Departments of taxtcabs for short  journeys           where a pool car would have to make a-long wait  or           return empty.6.     If  the numbers in the Pool are further diminished,the proportionate cost of  supervision and other  overheadcharges must necessarily increase as we have now reachedthe lowest unit of  supervision^7.     In  any case  the cost of control  and  the proportionof  standing-by time must necessarily bo far - greater thanin  the case of a commercial taxicab business^    During  JulyaTS D0QUI.O1T IS TK3 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAMIO HAXSSTyS GOVERNMENT,
the running time for all, core averaged under 9$ of totaltime.9,     The experience of the last six months indicates that Departments generally would find little or nodifficulty in using taxicabs for any official journeys.required to be wade by oar in the London District.9*     I therefore ask for Cabinet authority to disbandthe Pool (with the limited exception statesd below) andto hand over the vehicles to the Disposal Board forimmediate sale.10.    I should wish to have discretion to retain twotouring oars in the pool for a further period of notmore than three months for the purpose of long distanceinspections, where absence of Railway facilities necessitatesthe use of a car and a taxlcab would be too slow*   Therewere 56 such Journeys over 40 miles during the month ofJuly.IX.    In the meantime I propose to make enquiries of selected car-hiring firms with a view to making arrange-ments under which the Departments concerned may,  in thecircumstances mentioned in paragraph 10 above, hire at reasonable rates, suitable cars for inspection duties.12*    In addition outside the pool oeirtain/purely depart-mental inspection cars may be necessary and that  I will deal with departmentally.    I am seeking  Cabinet  authorityto abolish the pool on the ground and conditions  set  out n paragraphs  1  to il above.                             (Sgd) ERIC GEDDES.15th August&apos;, 1920.
