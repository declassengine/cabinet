P.174S *                GENERAL VILLA AND THE MURDER OF1 MR.BENSON*MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR v-&apos;AR.        I observe from the telegram from Mexico (No.181) of the29th of last month that the question of the British Governmentdemanding that proceedings should be taken against General Villafor the murder&apos;of Mr *Benson in 1914 is now raised.   I hope thatthis brutal murder of a Eritish subject will not be allowed to drop out of sight 0  I took an interest in this case at the timeand have never forgotten it during the war.  I felt sure an oppor-tunity would occur of bringing this murderer to justice.  One of the true signs of a great nation is the care and patience with whichit pursues just claims in regard to the lives and safety of itssubjects.  I earnestly &quot;trust that everything possible will be done.                             (Initialled)   W.S.C.&apos;5th August,- 192Oo        Decypher, 1r.

My United States colleague has received no &apos;Instructions relative to Columbus raid and murders ofAmericans but recalling Pershing punitive expeditionbelieves that His Government will take some action.
