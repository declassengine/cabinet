                  INDU.       1  Rear-Admiral Henry L. Mawboy, C.^. has beenappointed by the India Of fie 9 to he Director of the RoyalIndian Marine from the 28th August, 1920, for a period offive ?,rears.   He will also act as Senior Naval Officer atBombay with the title &quot;Rear-Admiral, Bombay&quot;.ITALY.          The  following  is  a digest  of the conclusions of  the  Oomittee of the  Italian Chamber which has been      ;  examining  the Naval Estimates        &quot;As  regards construction,  if  other nations consent     &quot;to disarmament or a reduction of armaments,   Italy     &quot;will very willingly follow their examwle*   This should     &quot;he the aim of the various Governments and diplomatists,    - &quot;hut unfortunately there are  no  signs of any attempts     &quot;being  made in this  direction.   Italy must tako into&apos;     &quot;account the situation  in tho Adriatic, and tho naval     &quot;power  of  Groeos,  which is likely to be increased,     &quot;given  the sea-faring habits  of  hen people and her     &quot;ambition.    It is foolish to expect&quot;to be able to     &quot;improvise a fleet in a crisis as a long time is     &quot;necessary for. the preparation and training of the     &quot;material  and personnel,    Italy does not seek to enter     &quot;into competition  with  richer and more powerful nations     &quot;but she must have as a minimum  the fleet necessary to     &quot;defend herself.   At present, this is provided by     &quot;existing  ships and  those under  construction, together     &quot;with an adequate  number of torpedo-^eraft, submarines,     &quot;aircraft  and an efficient coastal defences   The light     &quot;craft  at  present  under construction must be hurried on     &quot;to completion and as soon as possible the four ships     &quot;of the &quot;Vittorio  Emanuele&quot; class must be replaced by    . &quot;four, battle cruisers&quot;.  (N.B.   This  probably refers to  the four cruisers, the  projected  building of which was  reported some time back.  These   are not battle cruisers in the generally accepted  sense, hut even the &quot;S.FAR00&quot; was referred to as a battle  cruiser during the war).        &quot;As  regards the Arsenals,  for political considerations     &quot;they should be retained in the  hands of the State.  It     &quot;is proposed to keep un the strength    naval personnel     &quot;to the pre-war number&quot;.          Except for a small amount  of! destroyer repair work  the  Naval  Dockyards (Arsenals) at Naples, Venice and  Castellamare   are being wholly devoted to mercantile work.          The  few men  still mobilised in the Italian Navy of  the  1897 class (birth year)  are  being demobilised at once..  The  18^8 class will shortly be demobilised,   The 1901  class  whioh is larger than the usual &quot;levy&quot;, is being called  irp for service this autumn.         The Greek Government has called up, for service in the Army, Naval Reservists of the 1915 and 1916 classes and the first half of the 1917 class, 5,000 in all,DANUBE
                 DANUBE.         It is considered that the time  for  the  withdrawalof the British Danube Flotilla has arrived.   Franco, whichis the only other non-riparian povrar maintaining&apos; a  flotillaon the river, is to be asked her views,  and  it is proposedto raise tho question at  the Danube Conference in Parisof limiting the forces of non-riparian powers to astaticnnaire at G-alatz.
            -mvzrr.--        , The British troops have retired from Menzil  toKasvin.   This has caused considerable consternation  inTeheran.   Unless the situation in Mesopotamia can hestabilised, it may be found necessary to withdraw our forces from North West Persia as otherwise they will  bein danger of being out off.         In North East Persia the situation is more satisfactory.                   MESOPOTAMIA.         The general situation remains unsettled.    TheArabs continue to attack the British forces and therailway and communications between Diwaniyah and Hillah.         G.0.6, has requested O-dn-C, East Indies,  todisembark a Naval and Marine landing party at Basrah,H.M.S. &quot;Espiegle&quot; will proceed there jjrovided her presenceat Muscat is not essential.   C-in-C. is of opinion  that more ships should be sent but Is awaiting report fromS.N.0,, Persian Gulf.                     FIND AND *         The Russian Soviet Government would appear t^ beapprehensive of ^inland&apos;s attitude should the Alliesdetermine to support Poland, and are reported as being$esirous of at once concluding an armistice with Finland,as opposed to a definite peace, at the Dorpat Conference.The Finnish delegates have been Warned to reserve fully the right cf the Finnish Government to attend anyConference touching their interests in London or erlsewhere.                  S0V 1ST  RUSSIA.  .Trade Negotiations,.   The critical situation owing to th4continued advance of the Red Armies ifrto Poland,  and thoevasiveness of the Russian reply to the Allied ultimatum,overshadows, everything, and all negotiations are  for thepresent suspended.                      BALTIC.         Finland, Esthonia, Lithuania and Poland are sending delegates to the Baltic Conference which starteddeliberations at Riga on 3rd August, 1920.Esthernia.   Large consignments o^ Bolshevik gold andmerchandise  are stated to be at Reval.   american companies have started -operations in rolling-stock andlocomotive imports, and apparently coal and sulphur fromBritish sources are finding their way into Soviet Russiathrough Esthonia.Latvia.   The ethnographical Dvina-Dvinsk boundaries ofLatvia have been occupied by Lettish troops.   Nocontact with the Bolsheviks has taken place.   Peacenegotiations still continue,.   The Soviet Governmentevidently wish to conclude peace as soon as possible.                                            Lithuania.
Lithuania.  Tho anti^olshevih feeling is increasing owingto the exoesses of the Soviet Government which has  boon setup in Vilna9   The Treaty of peace with Russia was,however, ratified on 7th August8    Negotiations with theBolsheviks over the proposed evacuation by the Soviet army of X;ilna, Grodno and Dvinsk continue.

General Wrangel has oonsolidatod his position onthe Mariupol-Dnieper lines   The anti-Bolshevik russian army holds the left bank of the Dnieper and -the whole ofthe Tendra Peninsula.Azerbaijan.-   H.!\ Government is continuing to bring allpossible pressure to bear on the Soviet Government to hasten tho relief of British prisoners at Baku.                  &apos;  SIBERIA.         The Government of the new Par Eastern Republicis stated to be a farce and is only kept up with a view topropitiating Japan.   It has little or no support fromthe inhabitants.   Red Terror is decreasing and nofighting with the Japanese at Verkhnoudinsk area liasrecently taken places   It is considered that as 3oen asthe Japanese evacuate Trans-Baikalia, the SovietGovernment will throw off the mask and advance onManchuria,,   It is predicted that in the near future theAmur Province in addition to Trans-Baikalia will come under Bolshevik rule^   The Maritime Province will, it isexpected, however remain independent owing to proximityof Japanese who^ in their own interests, will be obligedto take over de &quot;facto control of territory from the KoreanBorder to the Lower Amur*                     POLAND.         The Armistice negotiations between Poland and soviet Russia fell through, and sinoe then the latter have refused the British proposals for a 10 days!  truoe, etc.Fighting continues.                    HUNGARY.        &apos; There is great uneasiness in Hungary owing to thecontinued Bolshevik advance in South. Poland.         It is anticipated that the economic boycott of hungary wj.ll shortly colla/pse.                     ITALY.         Baron Alliotti, the Italian Plenipotentiary tothe Albanian Government at Tirana, has been relieved ofhis appointment as he was considered to have made too many concessions in.treating with the Albanians,   Anagreement was signed at Tirana on 3rd August betweenCount Nansoni, the newr Italian plenipotentiary, andSulbimam Bey, head of the Albanian Council, by whiohItaly
Italy abandons all claims to Albania with the exceptionof Sasena Island, opposite Valona, and the right  tofortify the two headlands, Treporti and Linguetta Point,the two extremities of Valona Bay.   Italy is also tohave the right of using the latter as a refuge and repairbase for her ships.   Italy is to use her influence  toobtain complete national independence for the Albanians,and will not allow any other power to interfere withAlbanians territorial integrity,,                      TURKEY.         Sir G. Grahame has been given authority to sign the Treaty at the earliest possible date5   The tripartite agreement is, however, not to be signed until the differences between Greece and Italy are composed.         The French, who have hitherto opposed giving a mandate to the Greek Amy in Asia Minor have now veeredround and are strongly in favour of the proposed newGreek advance to Angora.   General Milne is very strongly opposed, on military grounds, to this advance, which maylead to Greek troops getting compromised in the interiorand requiring military assistance.         The High Commissioner also opposes such an advanoe,on Political grounds, as being likely to cause aNationalist revival,   To allow such an advance after theTreaty has been signed would be tantamount to commencinga new war, would alienate all the moderating influenceson which we must rely for the restoration of normalconditions and would perpetuate disorder and rebellion,                      SPAIN,         The strike of quay labourers at Bilbao is still continuing, but outsiders are working under militaryprotection.   Several incidents have taken place betweenstrikers and &quot;blacklegs&quot;, and the position is consideredrather serious.                     BELGIUM.         The Dutch Government have put forward a tentativeproposal that the question of the sovereignty over theWielingen Channel shall be rapidly but carefully examined by an expert Commission, on which, besides Holland andBelgium, Great Britain and Prance would be represented.The Belgian Government are, however, unwilling to aooeptthe proposal for an expert Commission unless the jointcommunication of dissatisfaction with Holland1s attitudefrom the British and French Governments is previously madeto the Dutch.                      SYRIA.         According to messages from Beirout the situation inOil ioia has considerably improved.   French troops fromAdana are reported to have gained an important victory atYemije over large Kemalist forces.Recent
         Recent events have brought the question ofthe frontier betvraen Syria and Palestine to the forebetween Franoe and Britain.
