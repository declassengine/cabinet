I circulate a statement showing in detail the accumulation of Russian troops on the   0149Polish front from the time of the Denikin collapse in October last.                      9593                                                                   W. S. C.  THE WAR OFFICE,      3rd August, 1920.     1.  In  October,  1919, when the collapse of General Denikiirs army began, the Bolsheviks had opposing the Poles :          The XV ITH Army of 4f infantry divisions -19,000 rifles and sabres.     This force  occupied a frontage from  north  of  Polotsk  to  the  River Pripyat (approximately 250 miles).     2.  Denikin&apos;s withdrawal  from Kieff and subsequent evacuation  of  the  Ukraine freed the  Bolshevik XHth Army,  and  the front  in Poland was extended  to  the confluence of the River Zbruch with the Dniester in  the region of Kamenetz-Podolsk, making the total front  one of approximately 550 miles.  By January,  1920, therefore, the Bolshevik [front opposing the Poles extended from Polotsk  to Kamenetz-Podolsk (550 miles) and was held by :          The  XV ITH and Xllth  Armies of  7 infantry and  \ cavalry divisions      28,200 rifles and sabres.     3.  From January onwards  a slow  but  steady flow of reinforcements towards the Polish front was noticeable.  These reinforcements were composed mostly of troops liberated from the Esthonian and Southern fronts.   Early in  March the Bolshevik Polish front consisted of:          The XV ITH  and  Xllth Armies of 10 infantry and -g-cavalry divisions 40,200     rifles and sabres.     4. From the beginning of  March reinforcements arrived more  quickly and on 25th  April, when the  Polish counter offensive commenced, the Bolsheviks on their Polish front disposed  of:          The XV ITH and  Xllth Armies of 18 infantry  and  3 3 cavalry divisions      93,000 rifles and sabres.    In addition, on their left flank along the River Dniester the Bolsheviks had their XlVth  Army  of 3 infantry and  1  cavalry divisions  (12,400) available  (and  almost immediately employed)  for operations against the Poles.    Thus, on 25th April, the Poles were opposed by a force of:          The XV ITH, Xllth  and  XlVth  Armies  of  21  infantry and i\  cavalry    divisions 105,400  rifles and sabres.    5. Since the  commencement of Denikihs collapse, therefore, until the opening ofthe Polish counter-offensive in  April, the Bolsheviks had  reinforced their Polish frontwith:          16-g- infantry and 4-^ cavalry divisions 86,400 rifles and sabres.

Certain of these reinforcements have been absorbed into other units, one or twohave disappeared from  the front owing to having been severely handled, and recentlyfive divisions have been sent to the Crimea on account of General Wrangefs offensive.     8. Since October, 1919, however, 44f infantry and 14j cavalry divisions have beenbrought to  the  Polish front.   But owing to  the  absorption,  disappearance andwithdrawal of a few units for reasons mentioned in paragraph 7 above, the  Bolsheviksnow count on their Polish front a total of:          42f- infantry and 14-g- cavcdry divisions  having a  toted  strength  of 197,300     rifles and sabres.     This  force is  now organized into seven  armies the Ivth , XVth,  Illrd, XV ITH,XlTth, XIYth and Buddenie&apos;s Cavalry Army.
