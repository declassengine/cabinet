The following memoranda have been communicated to me by the President of the don Parliament, Monsieur Kharlamoff,  and the President of the National UkrainianCommittee in Paris, Monsieur Marcotoune.                                                                    w. s.  c.  THE WAR OFFICE,         ISth August, 1920.     With reference to the contemplated Conference  in  London, and in view  of thenegotiations which may be conducted  by the Allies with the Soviet Government, thePresident of the Parliament of the  Cossacks of the Don,  who has been deputed torepresent in the countries of the Entente the interests of the Cossacks of the Don,  ofAstrakhan and of the Terek, begs to submit the following considerations :      The Cossacks  of the Don and  other Cossack  inhabitants of Russia have notrecognized the power of the Soviets established in Russia by the Bolshevik CommunistParty since 25th October, 1917.     Having repudiated the Soviet power, the Cossacks proclaimed their independencethrough, their Representative Assemblies and have invested their freely chosen Atamansand  their Governments with full political powers.     When the Bolsheviks endeavoured to impose upon the Cossacks the Soviet  regime and  Communism in  economic matters, the Cossacks resisted this violence by the forceof arms.  This armed struggle  against the Red Army has now lasted three years.   at certain  moments the Bolsheviks succeeded in seizing the entire territory or  part  of theterritory of various Cossack  populations and in installing the Soviet regime.   After thelatter had been in existence for  a couple of months risings occurred against  the  soviet and  the struggle was renewed.  The entire population takes part in that struggle.     The Cossacks of the Don  have  organized  their own army, which  at one timenumbered 100,000, and was composed  of all categories of arms.     In  the first phase of the struggle, until the beginning of 1919, the Cossacks of the don  conducted  an  isolated warfare.   Later, having reached an understanding withGeneral Denikin, they placed  their  army  under his  command, in  his  capacity  of commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of Southern Russia.   They retained, however,their independence in respect of internal legislation and administration.     The struggle of the Cossacks of the Don and of other Cossack populations againstthe power of the Soviet is devoid of an aggressive character.  Several attempts weremade by the Government of the Don,  and by the population of certain Don territories,to arrive at a peaceful solution of their differences with the Soviet.  All these attempts,however, failed owing to the action  of the Soviet authorities, who gave orders  forwholesale executions, terrorized and pillaged the population, and in the end compelledthis  population to take up arms against them.  When the Red troops invaded Cossackregions  they were preceded by numerous refugees fleeing with their belongings andtheir cattle.  Entire territories thus became deserted.   The population of the southern part of  the Don territory had to flee  four times before  the  Bolsheviks.   Finally, inDecember,  1919, when the army of the Don retreated beyond the River Don into the,territory of the Kuban.  150,000 civilians, unfit  for military service, abandoned theirnative land and  passed with all  their belongings  into the territories  of the Kuban andof the Northern Caucasus.   A considerable number of these refugees perished  on the journey from epidemics, many were taken prisoners and shot by the Bolsheviks.  Someremained in various regions of Northern Caucasus, and only 20,000  managed to get tothe Crimea with the army.     (1320/365) 100  8/20 &apos; H&amp;S, Ltd. - 8486woSECRET.pI,N-^.P. 1179 2
      The population of the Don and of other Cossack territories refused and still refuse  to submit to a power that  brutally tramples upon the most sacred rights of the people,  introduces terror into the system of government, robbery and pillage into the economic  life  under  the  guise  of Communism-that  subjects the  population  to  most  cruel  persecutions, offers no guarantee of the inviolability of individuals and of property or of  the  freedom of labour, and  is intent upon destroying  the Cossacks  as  an element  incompatible with  the existence of Soviet power in Russia.      While repudiating the power of the Soviet and  struggling  in arms against it, the  Cossacks of the Don and other Cossacks have never  desired to be separated from the  rest  of Russia.   Towards the end  of  1917 the Cossacks of the  Don, the Kuban, the  Terek, Astrakhan,  Orenburg and  the hillmen  of the  Northern Caucasus  formed the  Union of the South-East, which was to serve as a nucleus for the restoration of Russia.      This  Union was  dissolved in the beginning of 1918 as a result of the occupation by the Bolsheviks  of its entire  territory, and could not  be revived on account of the military operations which  have  been conducted uninterruptedly in  the south-east  of Russia.   But the  Cossacks continue to be inspired with the  idea  of  such  a  Union, and  I feel certain that as soon  as regular  intercourse between the members of the late Union is re-established, the Union itself will be  restored. -      The   Representative  Cossack Assemblies  and  their  Governments have  always admitted the necessity  of  the Union, on Federal lines,  with other  formations whose programme included the reconstruction of Russia one and  indivisible  and the struggle against the  Bolsheviks.      It was  in this sense that an agreement  was made between the Cossacks of the Don  and General Denikin.  The agreement which  is now in operation between  the Ataman of the Don and  General Wranyfel is of the same nature.     In order to create  a united  front and to  make the  best use of the armed forces and technical means, the  Cossacks of the Don have placed their army under the sole command of General Wrangel.   This action was also  in  accordance with  the  wishes of the Entente Governments.     The  armed  forces of other  Cossack  populations  were included from the very beginning  of the struggle in the Volunteer Army, of which they formed the mainstay.     The Cossacks  of the Don and other Cossack  populations have created in their respective  territories representative institutions and authorities freely elected on  a democratic  basis.   In  inaugurating  a  new regime of freedom the  Cossacks have energetically and firmly put into practice  the principles of democratic legislation.  In the first place, they have generously satisfied the need of the rural population for land. The just solution of the  agrarian question in the interest of the masses  on Cossack territory was the more easily attainable  that the  ownership of the land by those who cultivated it was an old tradition  of Cossackdom.   The Governments of the Cossack regions of  Southern Russia also took measures, on a  vast scale, in order to improve the methods of agriculture in this granary of Russia, as well as to develop the industries of the country and its  railways.  The labour  legislation of the revolutionary period has been  carefully preserved  by the Cossacks.  Their Governments have always maintained a most benevolent attitude towards the conquests of the  working class with regard to the improvement of the  conditions  of labour and the  satisfaction  of professional requirements.    Space  does not permit to  enumerate all the enormous work accomplished by the Governments of the Cossack regions in respect of public order and of the economic life of the people.  It should, however,  be emphasized  that  these activities were devoid of all violence in matter economical for the sake of abstract principles.   :. The author of the memorandum was from 1906  till 1917  a  member, for the Don Cossacks, of all four Russian Dumas and Parliamentary Chairman of the Deputies of all Cossack regions,  and later  President of the Government of the  South-Eastern Union and  Chairman (President)  of the  Parliament of  the Don Cossacks,  which was the representative assembly  of the  largest  portion of  the  Cossack population.  In  this capacity the author is firmly convinced that  owing to all their historical traditions, their  mentality, their customs, the outline of their economic life and last, but not least, their  political opinions, the Cossacks  will never be reconciled  to the  doctrine  and practice of Bolshevism, that they will never  become  a blind tool  in the  hands of the Soviet and will never submit to its domination.    Recent events fully confirm this view.   After  the defeat of General Denikin, the Army of the  Don moved  from Novorossisk and Adler to the Crimea and is now fighting bravely on  General Wrangefs front, whilst the Cossacks on the Don and in the Kubanare rising against the Soviet and clearing their territories of Bolshevik troops.
                MEMORANDUM ON  THE SITUATION IN SOUTH RUSSIA.     The  bulk  of the population of South Russia  is agricultural peasant  farmersholding land as private property.  Naturally, Soviet (Jommunism is incompatible withthe economic principles of the South Russian peasantry.  The forcible  introduction of communism, Red terror, requisitions of grain and raw materials, and  endless mobilization-tions for  the purpose of waging civil war,  excite the implacable hatred of the local population to the Bolsheviks. . The war with  Poland,  who  has  made  an attempt to seize the territory of the Russian Ukraine  and threatens to restore Polish landlordismin the Ukraine, has induced the peasantry to cease its struggle against  Bolshevism  forthe time being, and even, in certain cases, to join the Reds against the Poles.     At the present time the peasant insurrections have burst out again  with increasedfury.  The principal regions affected are the Cossack  territories, the mountains of  theNorth Caucasus and the  Ukraine.  In the Don territory both on the Azov coast andin the central districts there are organized insurrections, the insurgents being in touchwith  the Don regular army operating on the  Crimean front.   The power of  theBolsheviks is merely nominal, and is maintained only in the towns and along the railway lines.  The whole of the  Kuban region  is  in a  state of revolt.  Information has beenreceived concerning the capture  of Noyorossisk by Piliuk, the leader  of the insurgentCossacks, while the rebels have  taken firm possession of Maikop and  Armavir.   the mountain tribes and the  Terek Cossacks are attacking the Bolsheviks in whole provinces of the northern Caucasus.     In the Ekaterinoslav, Kherson and Tauride provinces, and in the  southern portions of the Kiev  and Podolia provinces, a regular network of atamans (commanders) of the green Ukranian Army are at work.  Makhno has  cleared the province of Ekaterinoslavfrom the Bolsheviks and  has taken the town of Ekaterinoslav.     All  the  above-mentioned insurgents base themselves on General  WrangeFs Army,as on a properly organized nucleus.  General Wrangefs Army has been reorganized onthe basis of strict military discipline.   The soldiers are properly equipped and supplied,the officers are provided for, and looting and pogroms have practically ceased.     Wrangel&apos;s Government is introducing its agrarian reform by means of the immediateallotment of land to the peasants, and has declared for federation, i.e., for the  principle     The suggestion  that  civil war  should  be  ended  with a  capitulation  to theBolsheviks is  inacceptahle to us.   The  Cossacks, an  element of order and  politicalorganization, must be preserved from absorption and  annihilation by the Bolsheviks.     In dealing with the Russian question it&apos; would  be an error  to consider and treat the Cossacks merely as a part of General WrangeVs Army.  The Cossack armies whom represent have  a territory with definite frontiers,  their own  civil population andpolitical  power.  Consequently, they proclaim their  right to  take part in the solutionof the Russian question which u closely connected with their own future destiny.     The Cossacks  have fought for three and  a  half years at the front against thecommon  enemy Germany.  They have loyally fulfilled their  duty towards  the Allies.During the war there have been neither  traitors  nor  deserters in the Cossack units.They did not abandon the front until it became completely dislocated.     For  nearly three years the Cossacks have  continued to fight against the madmenwho are trying to bring about a new world-conflagration.   The Cossacks cannot sufferthe Powers of the Entente to refuse to listen, to their voice at this critical moment.     In view of the above, the author  of the  present memorandum deems  it his duty to state that the Cossacks of the Don, the Terek and Astrakhan            WILL NOT AGREE TO BEING INCORPORATED IN SOVIET RUSSIA.     The author appeals for assistance in  the  task of  defending  the  existence of thepopulation  of the Cossacks  of the Don, the Terek and Astrakhan independent from thepower of the  Soviet.  Representatives of the Cossacks  of the Don, the Terek andAstrakhan  should be admitted to the projected  Conference  in London or any other similar Council on an equal footing with the representatives of other political formationswhich have arisen  within  the  territory  of the  late  Russian  Empire, with a view todefending the  general interests of Russia in a spirit of concord with the representativesof General  Wrangefs Government.

of treaty  relations  with local state formations.    Wrangefs Army is not White Guardor reactionary, as the  Bolsheviks  assert, but is acquiring  the character of a national,peasant movement.   A striking proof of this is the fact that whole units of the red army -(even the Lettish regiments) are  going over to Wrangel, with their arms and supplies.  Wrangefs Army must be regarded as an  organization  unifying under onecommand  (a) the reorganized Volunteer Army, (6) the Cossack units of the Don Army,the Kuban  Division and the detachments  of  the Terek and Astrakhan Cossack, and(c) the Green Ukranian Army under Makhno and other leaders.    While  preserving the unity of  military command,  politically  Wrangefs  Government represents an  alliedadministration based on the agreement of all the  local Governments of  South Russia.It should be  mentioned  that South Russia is the  most  important region  for theproduction of grain  and raw materials,  of which the  Bolsheviks will,  of course,  be unable to  avail themselves, owing to the resistance of the peasantry.  On the contrary,the national peasant army will possess a ready-made food base.    To  sum up,  we assert that the struggle  in  South Russia has  really  assumed thecharacter  of the  union of the peasantry  and the  border  population against the urban and  workmen&apos;s  centres  of Northern  Russia.   Whatever  may  be  the chances and changes of civil war, the war now begun by the united peasantry will only deepen andspread.    The future of Russia, and its organization as a peasant  state; is in the hands of thenational peasantry.    Any attempt to recognize the Soviet Government in Russia is in total disagreement with the current of events, to  the  trend and character of the  national movement  in.Russia.
