The Report of the Departmental Committee on Workmen&apos;s Compensationhaving now been issued, the  question of legislation should be considered assoon as possible.      The Committee, whioh was  thoroughly representative, conducted an exhaustive enquiry, and the  Report - a oopy of which is appended  - issigned by all the members, although some of them make reservations on particular points,  their recommendations are praotioal and have been wellworked out.  The reception of then, judging by the press reports, has been favourable.      The terms of referenoe included a direction &quot;to consider and report whether it would be desirable, to establish a system of accident assuranceunder the oontrol or supervision of the State&quot;.  The Committee are unanimous-ly against any State-administered system.  They find that the main defects  inthe existing system of insurance are (i) the excessive premiums oharged to employers, and (ii) the danger  to the injured workman if his employer is notinsured, of losing his compensation owing to the employer&apos;s inability to payjand they oonsider that these oan be remedied by a scheme which they recommendof State supervision of the  rates of premium and a soheme of compulsory insurance.      (The Committee considered the possibility of combining sickness andaccident insurance,  but are of opinion that it would not be practicable for the Approved Societies under the National Insurance Acts as at presentorganised to administer workmen&apos;s compensation.)      They also propose substantial increases in the benefits provided bythe Act.  In view of present rates of wages and cost of living, a revisionof the Venefits is certainly overdue.  The scales of compensation  fixed bythe Act of 1906 have remained unaltered, except that a temporary additionof 75$ has been made by the  War Addition Acts to the weekly allowances paidin cases of total incapacity.      Great dissatisfaction  with the present benefits naturally prevailsamong the workmen, and their representatives have been pressing strongly forimmediate legislation, and I have given assurances on behalf of theGovernment that as soon as the  Report of the Committee was received, it wouldbe considered and legislation introduced if possible during the present session.                                          I      The War Addition Aots  - which are limited to the period of the war and six months after - cannot be allowed to lapse until they are replaced bypermanent provisions.  A mere continuance of theBe Acts which are limited in
scope would not satisfy the workers and there would be greatdifficulty in passing any partial legislation whioh dealt withbenefits alone.  In my opinion it would be undesirable to attemptto do so.  There appears to me to be no alternative but to under-take at onco amending legislation on the comprehensive lines propos-ed by the Committee.      The Bill will require careful drafting, but if taken in hand at onoe it should be possible to have it ready for introduction bythe time Parliament re-assembles, or very soon after:  and i recommend that I should be authorised to give instructions according-ly.  I do not anticipate that it will give rise to any seriouscontroversy.      If this conclusion is aooepted, there are certain important points to be decided before a Bill can be drafted:-(l) State Insurance,   My colleagues will agree that this is impracticable - it would involve the elimination of the insurance companies and the organisation whioh they have built up. and thecreation of a large new Government Department.(2) State supervision of rates of premium tf insurance companies.Under the present system an excessive proportion of the premiuminoome 1b expended in commission, profits and management expenses.&quot;During the last five or six years the employers have had to pay 100 in premium for every MB paid out in benefits to injuredworkmen&quot;.  The Committee consider that the management expenses.commission and profits, ought not to exceed 30$ of the premiuminoome, She remaining 70$ to be available for the provision of benefits, and they have secured the agreement of the Accident OfficesAssociation (representing practically all the chief companies) andof several of the leading c$npanies outside the Association to a working arrangement on this&quot;  -basis.  The details of this arrangement,which involves the fixing of maximum rates af premium for triennialperiods, are set out in  paras. 22-3 and Appendix A of the Report.      The Committee oaloulate that there will thus be saved on thepresent oost to employers a sum of between  1,850,000 and  1,500,000a year, which under the existing organisation would be paid away inexpenses of management, commission and profits.      The proposal certainly seems to be a sound one from theemployers1 point of view, and will help to secure to the workmen the greatly enhanoed benefits suggested by the Committee.  I recommendthat it Bhould be approved.(3) Compulsory Insurance.  The present Act provides no guarantee tothe workman that the compensation will in fact be forthcoming.  TheCommittee find that there is a large number of small employers who
are uninsured, that oases consequently arise where the workman Is unableto recover compensation, and that a strong feeling existti  among workpeoplethat this should be remedied.      They reoommend (i) that every employer - other than  the  Crown, alocal or public authcrity, a statutory oempany. or a householder inrespect of servants not employed by him for the purpose of his trade or business - shall be required (unless exoepted under (iijto insure withan insurance company or in a mutual association.      (ii) That every employer whose annual wage roll averages more than 20,000 over a period of three years, upon filing an applicationaooompanied by (a) a declaration describing his trade or business andverifying his wage roll and (b) a oertified copy of his balance sheetfor his then last trading year, shall be entitled to exoeptiwi frominsurance unless good grounds exist to the contrary.      (iii) That a substantial penalty should be provided  for  defaultand that arrangements for inspection should be made with the Ministryof Health or any other Department whose officers can oonveniently in theoourse of their ordinary duties assist in the detection of defaulters.      In my opinion, although the oases in which compensation  is lost through negleot to insure are not numerous, the strong claim made bythe workmen for a greater measure of security is entirely  reasonable, andit is difficult to see how it can be met except by oompulsory  insurance.Moreover, there is great weight in the argument that if greatly enhancedbenefits are to be provided, the danger of the workman or  his  dependentsfailing t* recover the compensation due will be seriously  increased.      There are of course objections to requiring employers to insurewith companies making a profit out tf the business, but it is  only theimprovident employer who would, in fact, be oeeroed, and if maximum ratestf premium are fixed, employers will always be able to oover their riskat a reasonable price.      As regards oost, this ought not to be serious if the servioes ofthe National Insuranoe Inspectora can be utilised;  and if the suggestion made below under head (b) for a levy on employers is adopted,  no expenditu^ure in salaries etc., need be incurred by the State.      I reoommend that the proposed scheme be approved.(4) Authority to exercise Control.  The Committee reoommend that thecontrol of the rates of premium and supervision of self-insurers shouldbe in the hands of a single official, whom they refer to under the designation of &quot;Commissioner&quot;.  They further recommend, with a view to efficiency of administration and general convenience, that theCommissioner should also be entrusted, bo far as practicable, -withall the duties falling to be performed by any Government department in relation to workmen1 s compensation.  They consider that the
Commissioner should waot under one of the Departments of State  sothat the Minister can be responsible to Parliament for his acts&quot;,and should be subject always to the directions of the Minister.      The working arrangement with the insurance companies providesfor the fixing of rates by a Government official, and it was strongly represented by the Insuranoe companies that one particularofficial should be made responsible for this duty.  This seems  to mea reasonable request, and if it is complied with, it would seemdearly desirable cn grounds of efficiency and eoonomy that thesame offioer should undertake (so far as practicable) all the other duties.      The &quot;Commissioner&quot; and his staff (which need not be large)should be employed in and form an integral part of one of theexisting Government Departments.      Two further questions then arise:-(5) In which Department the &quot;Commissioner&quot; and his staff should be       employedj                    and(6) How the extra cost to the Department should be met.      As regards (5). I am of opinion that the work -should be assigned to the Home Office as the Department which has always  been responsible for dealing with questions of employers1 liability and workmen^ compensation, and which is best qualified by its generalknowledge and experience of the working and administration of theAct.  Further, the duties which will have to be performed are ofa most heterogeneous oharacter and fall, for the most part, outsidethe ordinary activities of any existing  Department,      As regards (6), the Committee considered that the cost of theCommissioner and the staff working directly under him (which they thought would not exoeed at the outside  30,000 a year) should  be defrayed by the Treasury, but that there were also cogent reasons,in view especially of the large saving to employers, for placingit directly on Industry, and they suggested that it might be met bymeans of an annual levy on the wage rell of employers.  Theycalculated that the total annual wage roll of employers might amountto  1,200,000,000, so that an annual levy of l-400th per oent., i.e. 6d for every  1,000 of wages., would produce  30,000.      I am in favour of this&apos; latter proposal and see no substantialdifficulty in carrying it out if compulsory insurance is adopted.The insuranoe companies and mutual associations would pay the levy on behalf of the insured employers, and it would be easy to collect the amount individually, from the comparatively small number ofemployers exempted from compulsory insurance.      The question of the amount to be levied would require further investigation.  The  30,000 suggested! by the Committee was not, Iunderstand, based on any detailed estirate and does not inolude the
oost of inspection in enforoing  oompulsory insurance and some other expenses, whioh Bhould be met in the same way.(7) Benefits.  .                        A.  Oases of Death.Total Dependants.  Under the present Aot compensation is oomputed onthe earnings of the individual workman, without regard to the number,etc., of the dependants - an elderly widow without family receives thesame amount as a widow with young children.  The Committee think thisshould be altered so as to make satisfactory provision for the children.They reoommend that the widow&apos;s compensation should be awardedseparately from the ohildren&apos;s compensation and that the compensation to the children should take the form of individual weekly allowancesat the rates provided under the Royal Warrant for the children of widows in receipt of war pensions, namely, 10/&quot; a week for the first(or only), child, 7/6 for the seoond, and 6/- a week for every other ohild, until the ohild reaoheB the age of 15.      To provide these allowances, employers are to be required in every case where a ohild under 16 is left, to make a &quot;flat&quot; payment of  500into a Central Fund to be established under Government Control - theGovernment to have power to revise this amount either upwards or down-vrards, if necessary, and the Fund to bear the expenses of administration.The Committee were satisfied, I understand, that there is no reason -if compulsory insuranoe is adopted - to apprehend that this liabilitywould lead to any discrimination in employment between married andsingle men.      As regards widows, the Committee reoommend that the compensation should be fixed in every case at  250.  Where the dependants includeother total dependants besides a widow and children, the Judge shouldhave power to award a further  sum not exceeding.  50.      The maximum liability in a oase of death would thus be  800.      These proposals are made unanimously, except that the workmen&apos;representatives would substitute  300 for  250 and  100 for  50 incases above mentioned.      In view of the unanimity of the Committee and the undoubted needfor making better provision in the case of children,  I reoommend thatthese proposals should be approved.                        B.  cases of Incapacity.Total Incapacity.  Under the Act compensation during total incapacityis a weekly payment (a) not exceeding one half of the weekly earnings and (b) subject to a maximum of  1.      As regards (a), proposals for increasing the percentage ofeurnings - varying from 663 per oent., to 100$ - were made on theworkmen^ side, while most of the employers&apos; witnesses argued for theretention of,the 50/ .  The Committee observe that it is universallyrecognised that a man injured in his employment should be a charge
 upon Industry, and acoepting the view that a reasonable increase in the  percentage is not likely to lead to further malingering to any material  extent, the majority recommend an inorease to 663 per cent.      As  regards (b), the Committee observe that when the maximum of  1 was fixed, the average wage for a well-paid skilled workman was  approximately  2 and that&apos; thai figure is represented by at least 90/- a week today and, allowing for the increased percentage the  main  Report proposes 60/-&quot; as the weekly maximum.      In  making these proposals the Committee say &quot;We have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not proposing to add seriously to the  burden on Industry.  Indeed in. the oase of Insurance Companies we are assured, taking Into account the effect of the proposed  working arrangement with the companies, the present rates of premium will not be inoreased for the next three years beyond 20$.&quot;      The Committee also refer to &quot;the small extent to which the provision for workmen&apos;s compensation benefits inareases the price of the  product to the consumer.  As an instance, in the case of coal, whioh is one of.the most expensive risks....the ooet today amounts on an average to less than 2d for every ton of coal dealt&apos; with ,  and....in the majority of industries the charge to the consumer  in oonsequenoe of the existing provisions....is only a fraction  of one penny in the   on any artiole purchased&quot;.      Various reservations are put- in by different members of the Committee.  Mr. Guthrie on the employers&apos; side suggests the retention of the 50/. with a maximum of 45/-.      On  the side of the workmen, Mr. Fred Hall, Mr. Tom Shaw and Capt. Albert Smith say that in their opinion full wages should be paid for  total inoapaoity.      Sir Walter Kinnear (National Health Insurance), Sir AlfredWatson  (Government Actuary) and Mr. W.R.L. Trickett (Treasury) oonsider that the maximum limit should not exceed 50/- a week.      The whole question 1b exceedingly controversial, but I think the proposals in the main Report should be adopted as affordinga logical and, on the wholefsatisfactory compromise.Waiting Period.   Under the Act of 1906,  compensation is onlypayable where the incapacity lasts more than a week, and is notdated back unless the inoapacity lao*s  two weeks or more,  Theresult is that, the  injured workman who has to lie ,up f or a&apos;fewdays is induced to extend his  period of inoapaoity to 14 days so asto receive compensation for the full period.  -
HOME OFFICE,    WHITEHALL.      The Oomniittee reoommend - and I agree - that a raiting period  ofthree days, with no dating baok, (as under the National Health insurance acts) should be adopted.                         0.  Medical and Surgical Aid.      The Committee were impressed with the neoessity for further  medical and surgical aid to injured workmen.  At present a workman is entitledto medioal treatment under the National Insuranoe Acts but only &quot;such treatment as i6 of a kind which oan....be properly undertaken by a generalpraotitioner of ordinary professional competence and skill&quot;.  This doesnot cover the special services of expert physicians and surgeons,  massage,x-ray treatment, in-patient hospital treatment, etc.      The Committee oonsider that these extra services should be provided as an additional benefit at the expense of the employer whose liabilitywill be reduced by the speedier and fuller restoration of the earning capacity tf the workman.  They recommend that these extra services underthe workmenr8 Compensation Act should be oo-ordinated with the arrangements now under consideration by the Ministry of Health for the benefit  of thepopulation generally and that provision should be made for bringing  thebenefit into force by Order-in-Council (the draft of which Order shouldbe previously approved by Parliament) as from a date to be fixed in  theOrder.      1 recommend that this proposal, which is unanimously recommendedby the Committee and is, I understand, approved by the Ministry of Health,be also adopted.

                              REPORT                                  TO THERIGHT  HONOURABLE  THE   SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR                     THE  HOME  DEPARTMENT                                  BY THE       IDepartmental  Committee appointed to  inquire  into the  system ol               Compensation for Injuries to Workmen. SIR,     WE, the Committee appointed         to  inquire into the working of the present system  of  the  payment of         compensation to workmen for injuries sustained in the course of employ-         ment, and to consider and report whether it would be desirable to establish         a system of accident assurance under the  control or supervision of the         State; and to report further what alterations of the law will be required to         remedy defects which experience has  disclosed or to  give effect to  their         recommendations have the honour to report as follows :     The present system, which is based upon the Workmen^ Compensation Act of 1906, is so comprehensive in its character that it is a matter of immediate concern to the majority of the  community.   It imposes on employers a burden of upwards of  8,000,000 a year, and its cost is an item which every business enterprise must take into account. The total number of workers within the scope of the Act is calculated to be about 15,000,000, and the negotiation and settlement of the claims of those who belong to organised labour is an important part of the work of Trade Union Officials. Sixty-five Joint Stock Insurance  Companies  do workmen&apos;s compensation business with employers having a wage roll exceeding  600,000,000 a year, and their annual premium income in respect of workmen&apos;s  compensation risk is well  over  5,000,000. Furthermore, there are about fifty Mutual Indemnity  Associations who insure their members against workmen&apos;s compensation risk and who pay about  2,000,000 a year in compensation, and  the majority of employers in several  of the most important industries in the country cover their risk  by this means.    The idea that  a  workman injured  in his employment  should be entitled to compensation irrespective  of any question  of  negligence,  revolutionary in  1897 and still novel in 1906, has by 1920 achieved world-wide acceptance.  In  1906, workmen&apos;s compensation legislation was unknown in the United States of America, Now there are Workmen&apos;s Compensation Laws in forty-two of the forty-eight States comprised within the Union,  as well as in Hawaii and Porto Rico.  Each State or Province of the British Dominions has an Act which is the subject of constant amend-ment in the endeavour to improve administration and increase benefits without unduly burdening the employer.   In 1913, Russia, following the example of the other European nations, had set up an interesting workmen&apos;s compensation system whichwas to be worked through the agency of employers&apos; associations, and in 1919 Portugal decreed  a comprehensive law  on the same  subject.  The presence of Salvador, Cuba and Japan in the list of States possessing workmen&apos;s compensation  laws shows howuniversal this form of legislation has become.    We have held 60 sittings and have  heard evidence  from 108 witnesses.  Theemployers&apos; point  of view was  stated by  witnesses  representing a  number ofparticular Trade Eederations and  Associations  and individual  firms as  wellas the Association of British  Chambers of Commerce.   The Trades  Union CongressParliamentary Committee, the General Federation of Trade Unions, the ScottishTrades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee, the Dublin Trades Council andLabour  League,  and representatives  of   individual  Trade   Unions  stated the&apos; case  for  the  workmen.    The  views  of  those   concerned   with   theadministration of the Act were expressed by witnesses  representing the English
 County Court Judges  and Registrars, the Sheriffs Substitute of Scotland,  the Irish Courts, the Medical Referees and the Certifying Surgeons.  Representatives of Insurance Companies, Mutual Indemnity Associations, and Friendly and Approved Societies also contributed  an important body  of  evidence.  A number  of officials representing Government Departments concerned, and organisations like the British Medical Association and the Charity Organisation Society, assisted us  with their views on special aspects of the enquiry, and  Mr.   Edward  C.  Stone,  of  the Massachusetts Bar, described his experience in  America.     In addition, we have called for and received a large volume of written evidence. A circular letter was addressed to organisations of employers and workers, and many replies were received, and nearly 250 firms have favoured us with a voluntary expression  of  their individual views.   In order to enlist the co-operation of Whitley  Councils,  we circulated a comprehensive questionnaire to those bodies. The Mutual Indemnity Associations have  at our request  sent us full information describing the part they play in the administration of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.  With the co-operation  of the  Foreign Office and  Colonial  Office, we have been able  to  circulate to  the  Governments  of  the  British  Dominions  and of many Foreign  States  a detailed  questionnaire, and  have obtained in  replya most valuable body of information  as to the provisions of the workmen&apos;s com-pensation laws of those countries and as to the manner in which those  provisions have worked out in practice.  We desire to express our appreciation of the readiness- ness with which our somewhat exacting requests for information have been complied with.                                 PART I.THE DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE  LAW  RELATING TO  WORKMEN5S      COMPENSATION AND  ITS PLACE AMONG  LEGAL REMEDIES      FOR PERSONAL INJURY.     Until 1880 the only legal remedy open to the workman who had suffered bodilyinjury when following his employment  was  a Common Law action against his employer.  In that year  the Employers&apos;  Liability Act somewhat  modified in the workman&apos;s interest the old rigid Common Law rules.  A new chapter in the historyof the Law relating to Master and  Servant was  opened  by the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Act of  1897.  The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of 1900 extended the1897 Act to agriculture.  The  Workmen&apos;s Compensation  Act of 1906 codified and extended the Acts of 1897 and 1900, and now in its turn comes up for review.    An action at Common Law is only available when it can be shown that the personal  injury complained of arose from the employees personal  negligence  or because he  knowingly employed an incompetent servant.   Even then, however, theplaintiff may have to meet the defence of volenti non jit  injuria, a doctrine whichdeprives a servant of the right to recover damages for personal injury if, appreciat-ing the risk he is running, he agrees expressly or by implication to accept that risk.Furthermore, a counter-charge  of  &quot; contributory negligence,&quot; that is to say, want of ordinary care on his own part, proof of which by the  employer may deprive a workman of success in the action, has almost always to be met.    Even  if  the plaintiff successfully&apos; surmounts the  defences of volenti non  fitinjuria and &quot; contributory negligence,&quot; there remains the even more serious obstacleof the doctrine of  &quot; common employment,&quot; which excludes  liability when the injuryis caused to the workman by  reason of the negligence  of  a fellow-workman in theemployment of  the same master for the purposes  of the  same  business,  and it makes no difference that the injured workman was bound  to  obey  the orders  ofthe fellow-servant whose negligence caused the injury.  The  cases where an injuredworkman can hope to succeed in a Common Law action for  negligence are accord-ingly but few.   29358                                                                A 3
     If the  workman is killed in his employment, those  dependent upon him have no remedy  at Common Law.  Lord campbell&apos;s Act, however, creates an exception to this rule.  It is there provided that whenever the death of a person is due to the wrongful act, neglect or default of another which would, if death had not resulted, have entitled the deceased to maintain an action in respect of the injury, then an action will  lie.  Such an action can, however, only  be maintained for the benefit of a wife, husband, parent or child of the deceased, and only subject to the conditions which would have made a Common Law action maintainable by the workman himself had he lived, so that the same difficulties which have been indicated as standing in the way of a Common Law action for negligence have to be surmounted to achieve success in an action under Lord CampbelPs Act.     The legal position at the time of the passing of the Employers&apos; Liability Act, 1880, and the defects for which it was intended to be a remedy, were thus described by Mr. Justice Cave, in the course  of his judgment in Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley, 9 Q.B.D. 357: &quot;  As far back as  the date of the decision  in  Priestley v. Fowler &quot; (1837) 3 M &amp; W.1, the law was  that  the workman could  not  recover for injuries &quot; sustained  by him through the negligence of a fellow servant.  In Priestley v. Fowler &quot; this rule  was said to be founded upon an  implied contract between master and &quot; workman  that the master should not be liable.   The Courts of Common Law have ct always felt hesitation in holding that  there  could be any right of action otherwise &quot; than arising out of contract or tort.   They therefore applied  the doctrine  of &quot; implied contract, the effect of which, so far as a man&apos;s legal liability was concerned, &quot; was much the same as if  there had been an express  contract.  The doctrine was &quot; extended  by Wilson v. Merry (1868)  L.R.  1 H.L. Sc.  326, to injuries caused  to &quot; a workman by a foreman or person occupying a position of superintendence in the &quot; same employment.   The Employers&apos; Liability Act was  passed to remove the diffi- &quot; culty arising from the decision in Wilson v. Merry.  The effect of it  is that the &quot; workman  may bring his action in five specified, cases, and the employer shall not &quot; be able to  say in answer that the plaintiff occupied the position of workman in his &quot; service and must therefore be  taken to have impliedly  contracted not to hold the &quot; employer liable.  In other words, the legal result of the  plaintiff being a workman &quot; shall not be that he has impliedly contracted to bear the risks of the employment.&quot; It is to be noted that this doctrine of implied contract  is one which appears not  to be found in any other country in Europe.     The Employers&apos;  Liability Act  imposes  on the master liability for accidents causing injury or death brought about by defects in works, plant or machinery due to the master&apos;s negligence, or negligently left unremedied by him, and for similar acci- dents caused by the negligence of fellow servants entrusted by the employer with duties of superintendence.  The  Act does not  deprive the employer  of the defences of volenti non fit  injuria, or contributory negligence.  In practice,  proof of negligence- gence has been found to be  a difficult matter and the costs of an action under the Employers&apos; Liability Act are considerable.  The Act of 1880 has not therefore been successful in providing a certain  and easy means  of  obtaining  compensation for injury or death from industrial accidents, and in the view of those whom it was intended to  benefit, any value it possessed was completely destroyed by the decision in 1882 in the case of Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley, 9 Q.B.D. 357, that it was legal for a workman  to contract with his employer not to claim compensation for personal injuries under the Employers&apos; Liability Act, in other words, that the workman could &quot; contract out &quot; of the Act.    The doctrine of &quot; contracting out &quot; became the  subject of ceaseless agitation  in the Trade Union world, but it was not until 1893 that the demands for its abolition were embodied in a Government measure.  Mr. Asquith&apos;s Employers&apos; Liability Bill of that year  represented an attempt to make effective the principles on which the Act of 1880 was  founded, which he described in these words :-          &quot; The Bill contains three vital principles.  The  first is that it abolishes      &quot; the  doctrine of common employment; the second is that it prohibits contracts      [t by a workman renouncing his statutory rights; and thirdly, it simplifies the      &quot; procedure by means of which the workman  can seek his statutory remedy.&quot;      (Hansard,  1893, Vol.  8, Col. 1960.)   The House of Commons passed the Bill but afterwards abandoned it rather thanagree to the  insertion therein of an amendment by the House of Lords preservingcontracting out, even though it was hedged about with various safeguards.
     When, four years later, another Government took up the problem, the question had to be decided whether they should proceed by the road along which the authors of the Employers&apos; Liability Act had travelled a short distance, or whether they should strike out into the entirely new path indicated in the amendment which had been moved by Mr. Chamberlain when Mr. Asquith&apos;s Bill was before  the House:  &quot; That &quot; no amendment-  of the law relating to Employers&apos; Liability will be final or satis- &quot; factory which does not provide compensation to workmen for all injuries sustained &quot; in the ordinary course of  their employment and not caused by their own  acts or &quot; default &quot; (Hansard, 1893,  Vol. 8,  Col.  1961).     The Government decided on the bolder course for reasons thus  described by Lord Brampton in the course of his judgment in Cooler and Crane v. Wright [1902] A.C. 302 : &quot; It was  .  .   .  felt by the Legislature that it would be but just and &quot; right to confer upon a large class of workmen, whose necessities compelled them to &quot; seek employment in certain specified dangerous occupations, in  the course of which &quot; accidents, not always possible to be guarded against, are of frequent occurrence, &quot; some purely casual, others  no doubt attributable to negligence ,or default of fellow- &quot; workmen, whom it would be idle  to sue, or others whose identity could not be &quot; established, a right to  claim compensation to a moderate and limited amount in &quot; respect of the loss of such wages as they were incapacitated from earning  in con- &quot; sequence of accidental  injury, upon mere proof of the accident  and  its resulting &quot; loss, irrespective of its cause.     &quot; Another object was to impose the obligation of providing such statutory com- &quot; pensation upon those to whom good sense would naturally point as the fittest * persons to  bear it, and to  define for the convenience of injured workmen seeking &quot; compensation the persons from whom they are entitled to claim it.  And, further, &quot; to provide a simple proceeding, entailing comparatively trifling expense, by which &quot; such compensation&apos;might, if necessary, be enforced.     &quot; To carry out these very laudable objects the Act of 1897 was passed.&quot;     The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,  1897, effected  a revolution in the branch of law which concerns  the legal relationship between employer  and workman in the occupations to which the Act applied, for it imposed a liability upon the employer to pay compensation to an injured workman or to the dependants  of a workman who had been killed, quite independently of the question whether or  not there had been negligence on the part of the master or of anyone employed by him.     All that the Employers&apos; Liability Act had done was to provide exceptions to existing Common Law rules.  The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act set up an entirely new doctrine and provided rights and imposed obligations which nowhere fitted into the existing scheme of jurisprudence.     The new principle thus  introduced into English law was stated as follows in the first section of the  1897  Act &quot; If in any employment to which this Act  applies personal injury by accident  arising out  of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman his employer shall  ....  be liable to  pay compensation.&quot; The employments to which the Act applied were &quot; on or in or about a railway, factory, mine, quarry  or engineering work   .  .   .  .   and on in or about any building which exceeds thirty feet in height.....&quot;   The compensation payable was based on  the workman&apos;s  previous earnings.   In  the  case  of  the  workman&apos;s  death, such compensation took  the form of a lump sum not exceeding  300, payable to those who came within the category of dependants, and in the case of incapacity for work resulting from injury a weekly payment was to be made during such incapacity not exceeding 50 per cent, of the average weekly earnings up to  a maximum of  1. The circumstance that under the  Employers&apos; Liability Act compensation takes the form of a lump sum immediately payable, whereas under the Workmen&apos;s Compensa- tion Act it is a weekly allowance, is a consideration which still sometimes  weighs with an injured workman in favour of the  earlier statute.   Contracting out was allowed, but subject to the condition that the workman must contract into a  scheme which the Registrar of Friendly Societies was able, after inquiry, to certify as being a scheme &quot; on the whole not less favourable to the general body of  workmen and their &quot; dependants than the provisions of this Act.&quot;  Disputes were  to be settled by arbitration, and in introducing the Bill the  Home Secretary  said : &quot; Our hope is, with regard to arbitration, that committees will be established between employers and men to settle  the question.&quot;   Failing a committee  a single arbitrator was indicated as the proper tribunal, and  only failing both committee and single arbitrator was the County Court Judge  to be the tribunal, and even he was to  act in  the capacityof arbitrator  rather than judge.   29358                                &apos;                                  A i
    in 1900 the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act was extended to agriculture andimposed therefore upon a class of small employers, namely, small farmers, the lia-bility to pay compensation.  The two principles of the 1897 Act, that it should apply only to the more dangerous trades and, generally speaking, impose liability only uponthe larger employers, were thus departed from.    Statistics  snow a progressive diminution in the number of actions under theEmployers&apos; Liability Act.   In 1898 the total of such actions brought in England,Scotland and Ireland was 879.   Five y^ars later, in 1903, this total had fallen to689, and in 1908 the total had further dropped to 405.*  The comparative success ofthe first Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act  as compared with the very limited operation and apparently increasing unpopularity of the Employers&apos; Liability Act made itclear that it was along the lines of wor men&apos;s compensation rather than employers&apos;liability that future legislation of this class must develop.     In 1903 the time had arrived for the review of a statute which was avowedlyexperimental in nature.   A Departmental Committee was accordingly appointed inthat year to inquire and report &quot;  what amendments in the law relating to compensa-&quot; tion  for injuries to workmen are necessary or desirable, and to what classes of&quot; employments, not now included in the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, those Acts&quot; can properly be extended, with  or without modification.&quot;     The Committee reported in  1904, and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906,was the outcome of their recommendations.     The new Act abandoned the principle  of excluding all workmen not expresslyincluded, in favour of the plan of extending the Act to all employments with somefew specified  exceptions; and industrial diseases were brought within its  scope!Benefits  were  unaltered, but provision was made for  benevolent control by the re-requirement that lump sums, payable in fatal cases, should be paid into Court andadministered by the Judge for the benefit of those entitled thereto.  Provision wasalso made for bringing  the  adequacy of agreements for lump sums  in cases of incapacity under  the review of the  Court.   The  list of dependants entitled to compensation was expanded by the inclusion therein of grandparents, grandchildren,collaterals and illegitimate  children.  Procedure  was improved by enabling theCounty Court Judge to  summon a Medical Referee to sit with him as  Assessor,and also giving power to the parties to refer their dispute as to the extent or causeof  the workman&apos;s incapacity to a Medical Referee.  There  was also a  provisionenabling the Secretary of State to confer on committees representative of employersand workmen certain powers otherwise conferred exclusively on County Courts.Furthermore, the foundations were laid of a system of returns designed to enable theoneration of the Act to be brought under statistical review.                                 PART  II.                        SYSTEM OF  INSURANCE.    An important practical problem is how to administer Workmen&apos;s Compensationso&apos; as to ensure financial certainty, prompt payment of claims, and the avoidance of friction, at a reasonable cost.    The  system hitherto adopted in this country has been a system of voluntaryorganisation based on private enterprise.  It has been assumed that employers willfulfil all  the obligations imposed&apos; upon them, and there has been little or no Stateintervention to secure to the workmen or their dependants the benefits provided bythe Act.   It has also been assumed that employers desiring to insure against theirrisk will be able to do so on reasonable terms.    The  majority of employers, realising the advantages of the distribution of theburden of the risks, have  either availed themselves of  the insurance  offered by insurance Companies or have become members of Mutual Associations.  A con-siderable  number,  however,  carry their own  risk,  and are herein referred to asself-insurers.* In 1918 the total was only 63.
i    Thus, the agencies from which workmen^ compensation, benefits are forthcom-mg are :-        (i) Insurance companies doing business on a commercial basis.       (ii) Mutual associations privately organised and managed.       (iii) Self-insurers.    In our terms of reference, prominence is given to a question which has hithertonot been the subject of an official enquiry in this country,  namely, the desirabilityof a system of accident assurance under the control or supervision of the State.   this involves consideration of  the following methods of organising accident insurance,namely:        (i) (a)  The establishment of a State Fund either with  a monopoly of work-            men&apos;s  compensation insurance  or  in competition with  private enter-         \  prise,  or          (b)  the organisation of a State system of mutual insurance.       (ii) State control of the rates,  expenses  and profits  of  insurance companies            and of the financial stability of mutual associations and of self-insurers.                         SECTION 1. STATE INSURANCE.     In many foreign countries a State fund, with a monopoly of insurance or in competition with private enterprise, has been established.  In America, for instance, a large number of the States have provided for a State fund, either monopolistic 01 in competition with Insurance Companies.  The Compensation Acts in these States are of two general types &quot; the commission or board type, of which there are 30, and &quot; the self-administrative or court type, of which there are  10.  In the commission &quot; type, a special board, usually of three or five members, is appointed to enforce the &quot; law, including the administration of the State insurance  fund, if such a fund is &quot; created.  The commission is granted extensive powers and quasi-judicial functions. &quot; It receives accident reports, investigates claims, settles disputes, hears cases, grants &quot; awards, issues decrees, and, in case of a State  fund, classifies industries, fixes and &quot; collects premiums, and  pays compensation.  In some States it has the additional &quot; function of accident prevention, while  in a few  States it administers  the entire &quot; body of labor laws.&quot;*     The  monopolistic  State  Fund was thus referred to in evidence before us: &quot; In seven States exist the so-called monopolistic State funds, the most important of &quot; which,  or the one most commonly referred to, being that of the  State of  Ohio. &quot; Here, again, the State does not guarantee or assume any legal liability for the pay- &quot; ment of compensation to the injured workman.   It merely starts the fund by a loan &quot; or appropriation, as in the case of a competitive State fund, and then provides by &quot; law that all employers in Ohio save those who may be self-insurers-in Washington &quot; there is no provision for self-insurance-shall pay into the  fund premiums as is &quot; done in the case of the competitive State fund.  In other  words, the monopolistic &quot; State fund is a form of mutual company which is favoured by being started, as a &quot; rule, by such appropriation, and towards which, as a rule,  also, the State anxiually &quot; appropriates money for administration expenses.  It enjoys  a  monopoly in the &quot; compensation business, which is the reason for its name,  and the only exception &quot; to employers being compelled thus to insure is where, as , for instance,  Ohio, em- &quot; plovers  may be self-insurers.  This monopolistic State fund is administered by the &quot; Industrial Commission,  or other State Commission, which  collects premiums from &quot; the employers, invests the money thereby received, and parcels it out also  to the &quot; injured employee in the form of compensation.  In other  words, the Commissior &quot; is not only the custodian of the money received from employers for compensation&quot; and charged with the duty of keeping those funds and managing them economically,&quot; but also is the judge and jury to decide how much of the money shall be paid out&quot; to the injured workmen.&quot;f   * Bulletin of the  United States  Bureau of Labor Statistics,  No.  240.  &quot; Comparison of workmen^ Compensation Laws of the TJ.S. up to 1917,&quot; page 83.                             f  E.

         The first Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts  of the various Provinces of Canada    and  Australia followed the British pattern, but it is significant that  most  of the    Canadian Statutes have recently been remodelled on United  States lines.        The German system  provides  the most notable instance of a State organisa-    tion  of  mutual insurance.  The German Accident Insurance Law is  part  of the    Workmen^ Insurance Code of 1911, which includes Sickness,  Accident, and Invalid-    ity Insurance.  It is a system  of mutual  insurance on the monopolistic plan.  For    accident insurance,  the  employers&apos; mutual trade associations  are  the  insurance    carriers.  They are constituted on a trade basis and are purely employers&apos; organisa-    tions. Control is exercised by a series of public departments of ascending importance,    commencing with the local government authority of the town or commune  and    ending with the Imperial Insurance Office in Berlin.        In 1887 Austria adopted a compulsory insurance scheme on the German model,    but organised on a territorial and not a trade basis.        In  1912  Switzerland accepted by a referendum  vote  a law providing  for    Sickness and  Accident Insurance.  Compulsory insurance  in the National Fund    is prescribed for all workmen in the particular industries to  which the law applies.    Others,  those  engaged in agriculture, for example, may be  insured  voluntarily.    Accidents  are classified as occupational  and  non-occupational.   The  former are    broadly  those arising in the course of the employment; others belong t5s the second    category.  It is laid down that the purpose of the Fund is  to &quot; conduct insurance    on the mutual plan.&quot;        Italy has compulsory insurance, but permits employers to  insure in a great    variety of institutions. They may choose  between the National Accident Insurance    Fund; an authorised Insurance Company; a Mutual Association; and  private estab-    lishment Funds organised by the employers.        Other State  funds in their various forms are scattered about the world; some    States requiring insurance in  prescribed  institutions; others allowing  a choice of    institutions.4       It will be seen that the monopolistic State  systems above briefly described, and    our own system, are acutely divergent in principle.  To set up a State  system in this    country would be the substitution of one system for another; it would  not be a mere    amendment of an existing system.        The question before us is whether it is necessary, in order to alleviate the burden    of workmen&apos;s  compensation on industry  and  at the same time to secure, and if    possible augment, the benefits to which the workman is entitled, to replace the present    system by a monopolistic State system,&apos; or alternatively, to introduce into the existing    system a competitive State Fund.        We have devoted much time and attention to this question, and heard and con-    sidered  evidence  dealing therewith from &quot;numerous witnesses  representing all    interests concerned.   Speaking generally, the witnesses representing the Trade    Unions were in favour -of  a monopolistic State Fund, mainly on the ground that the    money which goes in profits to the  insurance companies would  be available for the    workmen.  On the other hand,  the employers and their representatives were unani-    mous against  a monopolistic State  Fund,  urging that it would be more expensive    than the present system and would not work so efficiently or satisfactorily in any    respect.5      The representatives of employers did. not  see  the same  objections to a  State    Fund in competition with Insurance Companies and Mutual Associations.  It was,    indeed,  suggested that it might exercise a beneficial influence  by keeping  down    rates of premium.  One of the main attractions,, however, of the State institution is    the relative cheapness of  the insurance it offers.  That  relative  cheapness largely    results from the absence of the  agents and brokers whose commission is so consider-    able an  item  in the expenditure of private insurance companies.   If the  State    institution is  to compete successfully with private companies it must  use the same    methods as the latter for acquiring business,  and its special attraction, that of    relative  cheapness,  is then in danger of disappearing.    If  it passively waits for
                                          a    business,  the  danger is that it will  be left with an  undue proportion  of  the    undesirable risks.j 6       The question of a compulsory system of mutual assurance had  apparently    not received much consideration at the hands of employers&apos; or workmen&apos;s associations,    and the subject was discussed only by a few witnesses.  The general effect of the    views expressed was adverse to the adoption of&apos;any scheme of this kind, the chief    objections being that many trades and employments were insufficiently organised,    and that the administration of compulsory mutual associations would lead to friction    amongst the&apos; employers, and further that the task of fixing equitable rates or levies    for  different classes of  employers in the  same industry  would be a matter of the    utmost difficulty. 7       The evidence satisfied us that:            (i) Insurance with an  Insurance Company or a Mutual Association is  a                 popular medium among employers in the United Kingdom for covering                 their workmen&apos;s compensation risk.           (ii) Employers generally  have  a preference for  private  enterprise rather                 than State management.          (iii)- There is a general feeling  among employers that the  administration of                 Workmen&apos;s Compensation by the State must necessarily tend to become                 rigid in character and slow in mechanism, and that,  owing to  the lack                 of competitive interest, it may easily become inefficient and expensive.          (iv)  The  administration  of  a  Workmen&apos;s  Compensation  Act  necessarily                 involves many disputes of law and fact, and it is not desirable for the                 State  to enter a sphere  of  administration involving disputes with                workmen which frequently become the subject of litigation.           (v)  The workmen&apos;s representatives,  while  strongly  in favour of a  State                 scheme,  were emphatic in their opposition to any proposal that they                 should be called upon to contribute to any State Fund,  even for  the                 purpose of. providing additional benefits.8      The suggestion that there should be one scheme of Insurance dealing with  the    workman in all cases of sickness, whether  due to accident or any other cause, had a    certain attractiveness which led  us to  consider the possibility of working  a State    scheme  of  Insurance for  Workmen&apos;s  Compensation  as  part  of  a National    scheme of  Sickness and Accident Insurance.   The evidence submitted, however,    satisfied us that  it  would  not be practicable  for  Approved  Societies  under    the National Health Insurance Acts, organised on their present lines,  to adminster    workmen&apos;s  compensation insurance.    The workers contribute a substantial pro-    portion of the contributions to the funds of the Approved Societies  and  Section 23    of the National Insurance Act of 1911  provides for these Societies being under  the    absolute control of-their insured members.   If, on the valuation of a  Society&apos;s funds-    a deficiency  is found, the members are liable to an increase in their contributions or    a reduction in their benefits.  In workmen&apos;s compensation  insurance the whole of  the    premiums are contributed by the employers, who alone would be affected by any excess    of claims and expenses over income.   It is obvious that the working of such a scheme    could not be entrusted to Societies controlled solely by the workers.  Even if this    difficulty were surmounted, it is  difficult  to see how the Approved Societies and    Branches, the majority of which are not organised on  an occupational basis, could    use their present machinery of collecting flat contributions by means of stamped cards    to administer a form of insurance which, of necessity, entails considerable variation    in the rates of premium, as between different occupations, and a frequent  revision of    rates according to claim experience.  Moreover, the financial liabilities of  workmen&apos;s    compensation insurance are more onerous than could, with prudence,  be under-  (    taken by many  of  the  12,000  Approved Societies and  Branches throughout  the    country, and if these liabilities were pooled in a Central Fund, as has been suggested,    the Societies could not retain that independence in government and  administration    which characterises their operations at the present  time.9       The foregoing facts  and considerations appear to afford strong grounds  against    the establishment0of a State System of Accident Insurance, but, before arriving at a    definite conclusion, it  is necessary to consider in detail the working of pur  present    system in order to ascertain whether it discloses defects calling for a radical change.
                            SECTION 2. EXISTING SYSTEM.                         Sub-Section  1. Insurance Companies.10       The Insurance Companies transacting Workmen&apos;s Compensation business are    divided into two  classes, commonly called  (1) &quot; Tariff &quot; and (2)  &quot; Non-Tariff &quot;    Companies.        i The former consist of 48 of the leading Companies which are members of the    Accident Offices Association and work on the basis of an agreed tariff.   This Associa-    tion, we understand, was formed because before 1906 the insurance of the liability for    workmen&apos;s compensation was, so far as Insurance Companies were concerned, in    an unsatisfactory  and unorganised condition,  and  it was  desired to  place the    business on  a satisfactory basis.  The Association is now a recognised  authority,    among Insurance Companies,  upon workmen&apos;s  compensation insurance,  affording    as it does a medium  through which all.matters in  connection with the business    can be  discussed  and regulated.        There are 17  &quot; Non-Tariff &quot; Companies transacting  workmen&apos;s compensation    business that are not members of the Accident Offices Association  and which work    in active competition with the members of that Association.        There are also certain underwriting members of &quot; Lloyds &quot; who transact work-    men^ compensation business.        The only control now exercised by the State over Insurance Companies doing    workmen&apos;s compensation business is that conferred upon the Board of Trade by the    Assurance Companies Act, 190,9.  This Consolidation Act re-enacted the provisions    of the Employers&apos; Liability Insurance Companies Act, 1907, which  was  passed to    provide a check upon the promotion of undesirable companies for the transaction of    this class  of business and by requiring annual  returns to secure the disclosure of    information as to the actual financial position of all existing companies.  The policy    pursued was to apply the main principles of the Life  Assurance Acts with  such    modifications as were found necessary in the case of companies transacting this class    of business.        The Assurance Companies Act, 1909, imposes the  following  requirements in    respect of this particular  class of insurance business :           (a) A deposit of  20,000 is required if the company had not commenced to                to carry on the business prior to the passing of the 1907 Act (Sections                2 and 33 (1) (a1)), but subject, however, to withdrawal when  the funds                set  apart and secured  for policy holders&apos;  claims  amount to  40,000                and a deposit in respect of any other class of business is being main-                tained.   (Section 33 (1) (e)).          (b) A separate revenue account is required (Schedule I (D)) and  a separate                fund is hypothecated for this class of business.  (Section 3.)         (c) A  certificate is required to the balance sheet that no part of the separate                fund for this business has been applied to any other purpose  than that                to which if is applicable.  (Third Schedule, Note 4.)         (d) Analysed statements, showing  the claims experience over a period of                5 years,  are required (Fourth Schedule (D)),  and special provision is                required to be made for claims of five years&apos; standing and upwards.         (e) In a winding-up the liabilities to (1) a workman in respect of a permanent                disability benefit and to (2) the holder of  a current policy are required                to be computed on a certain specific basis.  (Sixth Schedule.)        The witness who  represented  the  Board  of Trade was of  opinion  that   these powers might usefully  be strengthened in the direction of giving extended   powers of supervision and criticism,  so that the whole administration of the work-   men^ compensation business of any particular company might  be investigated.   We &apos;  commend this evidence.to the attention of the appropriate Authority.        The workmen&apos;s compensation business transacted by  Insurance  Companies is   now largely in the hands of big composite offices, whose financial stability was not   questioned&quot; before us.       We endeavoured to ascertain from witnesses whether Insurance Companies had,   on the whole, dealt reasonably with employers and justly with workpeople.   We find   that employers are satisfied with the way Insurance Companies have dealt  with   claims and that the payment of benefits by the Insurance Companies  has,  generally   speaking, been prompt and satisfactory to the workmen.
     There is, however, another side to be considered.

     These  figures demonstrate  that  during the  years  1913-1918 inclusive  the Insurance Companies made substantial profits from this class of insurance.     It was explained in evidence by representatives of the companies that for many years before 1912 they conducted this business at a loss and that they then revised their rates.   Both premiums and benefits are based upon wages, with, the important difference that whereas the premiums are normally proportionate to the wage-roll, the benefits  are subject to limits which prevent the liability rising beyond a certain level  whatever the rate of wages may  become.  The effect  of the  general rise in wages m  recent years has thus been to increase the total of  the  premiums paid  by employers, without any corresponding increase of liability for  benefits, whereby the profits of  the companies have grown in a way that was not anticipated.    Whatever may be the circumstances in which the business was  transacted, the fact remains that, during the last 5 or 6 years, the employers have had to pay  100 in premium for every  48 paid out in benefits to injured workmen.  In our view this is wasteful and unsatisfactory.    Where a liability created by Parliament makes it imperative for the outstanding majority of employers to cover their risk by insurance, we consider that it is the dutyof the State to  ensure that the business shall  be  conducted on a reasonable  and economical basis.                     Sub-Section 2. Mutual Associations.     In addition to the oral evidence given before the Committee by representatives of Mutual Assurance and Indemnity Associations, the answers to a circular letter which was addressed to these Associations have enabled the  Committee to take a comprehensive survey of this system as it has been adopted in this country and of the arrangements and methods which are now in actual operation.     Complete statistical information as to  the working of Mutual Associations is not available.  From the replies received, however, it appears that the approximate number  of employers  who  are members of Mutual Associations  is 10,000.   The number of insured workmen cannot be stated, but it is an indication of the magnitude of the work of the Mutual Associations to find that 21 Societies return 691,675 work- men as insured;  wdiile 14 Societies which calculate their levies by the wrage-roll of their members return an annual wage bill of   142,070,000.  It further appears from returns made to the Home Office in respect of the seven groups of industries to which the provisions of Section 12 of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act  requiring em- ployers to make returns of compensation have been applied, that the annual totals paid for compensation by Mutual  Associations in those industries were:              In 1910    ...............       945,328             In 1911    ...............     1,146,273             In 1912   .................     1,306,549             In 1913    ...    ............     1,466,607    Owing to the War, statistics for the later years are not available.    Of the 47 Societies from which replies were received, 6 were  formed between 1880 and 1897, 22 between 1897 and 1906, and 19 subsequent to the passing of the 1906 Act.    Generally speaking, the chief reason given for the establishment of the Associa-tions was that it was considered the most economical method of insurance, and  theevidence  before us certainly led to that conclusion.    Membership of an Association is generally limited to employers who are membersof a particular Trade Association or firms in a defined trade.   Apparently only oneAssociation is open to all classes of employers.    The  employments in connection with which these Associations have been formedinclude coal mining  and quarrying (and any subsidiary trades carried on by theowners of mines  and quarries),  engineering and shipbuilding,  building, textiles,shipping, boot and shoe manufacturing, tailoring, mineral waters window cleaningmanufacture  of  optical,  &amp;c, instruments, pottery,  football  clubs,  fishing andfarming.
     The majority of the Associations  undertake to meet all  liabilities at common law and under the Employers&apos; Liability Act in addition to those under the Work-men^ Compensation Act.  A  few pay compensation in disablement cases after thefirst 13 or 26 weeks only.     The manner in which rates of levy or contribution are determined varies con-siderably.   In many cases calls are made which are based on the claims experience ofthe previous year.  In others a premium  is charged, as in ordinary Insurance Com-panies.   A third method is to make levies at fixed  periods to cover total cost eachyear.  Calls, premiums, and levies are fixed by (1) so much per cent, on wages, (2) somuch per  100 persons employed, or (3) in the case of textiles, so much per loom.Generally  speaking,  where levies are made there  is no  classification, but wdierepremiums are charged different rates are  fixed for different processes.     Only 6 societies re-insure.   Of these, 2  re-insure all their risk; 2 re-insure fordeaths 3 or 5 in number in any one accident; 1 re-insures for  accidents resulting inloss of more than 26 lives; 1  re-insures  for fatal accidents and for any excess of claims over 75 per cent, of premiums.     With  the exception  of a  few societies which have  an  Arbitration Committee,disputed claims are settled by arbitration  in the County (or Sheriff) Court.     Generally, members may withdraw by giving notice (from 3 to 12 months), thegeneral rule appearing to be that the retiring member forfeits his share of the funds,but the society remains responsible for all outstanding claims.  Where the  retiringmember is paid his share of the funds, he becomes responsible  for his own liabilitiesfrom time of withdrawal.  In one case members have to pay a release fee.     Where there are reserves, they are in most  cases built up year by year out of income or  by contributions from members either on joining or annually.   Wherethere is no reserve fund, the members are liable to be called upon as necessary.     The usual practice appears  to be to raise only sufficient money  each  year tocover the payments to be made during  the year.  Some of the Mutual Associationsmake provision for liabilities outstanding at the end of the year much on the same lines as Insurance Offices, but we gather  that a  large number, if not the majority,do not.     Generally speaking,  any surplus of income over expenditure is disposed of by being either carried to the reserve or carried  forward to the next year, thus reducingthe demands for that year.  In some cases either the whole or part of the surplus isreturned to members as &quot; bonus.&quot;     The provisions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, referred to in paragraph10 hereof, do not apply &quot; when  the company is an association of employers whichsatisfies the Board of Trade that it is carrying on ... . business wholly or mainly for the purpose of the mutual insurance of its members . .  . .&quot;  (Section 33  (1) (a).)The witness representing the Board of Trade expressed the view that had it been anticipated at the time of the passing of the Act that Mutual Associations wouldhave increased  so considerably, it is doubtful whether this exemption would havebeen allowed.  The view apparently taken was that since it was not obligatory upon an employer to insure against workmen&apos;s compensation risk, it was not unreasonable to exempt   from  the Act  employers  who form voluntary associations  for self-protection.  No case  of default by  a  mutual association was brought  to  our notice, butit is a fundamental principle of sound  insurance finance that the total liability in respect of claims arising in  each year should be provided for out of the contribu-tions paid  in that year, and that there should be adequate reserves for unexpiredrisks.  In our view, whatever degree of  control is imposed  in this respect uponInsurance Companies trading  for profit should be imposed on Mutual Associations,subject to the exception  that, in the case of Mutual Associations,  the deposit of 20,000 which is  required from Insurance Companies can be dispensed with.  Thisdeposit is not in the nature of a reserve fund, but was  intended to  prevent  the promotion of Companies  without substantial financial backing.
                         Sub-section 3. Self-Insurance.     The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act imposes upon the employer the liability to pay compensation, but it provides no guarantee, on the one hand, that the compensa- tion shall in fact be forthcoming, or, on the other hand, that the employer will not be ruined by the payment of a substantial lump sum.  The Act recognises but does not require insurance in respect of the risk thereunder.  The absence of any provision in our own Act for guaranteeing compensation is  peculiarly  striking in view of the fact that it includes within its  scope small employers generally, whereas many foreign States exclude  agriculture, domestic service  and  employers with less than a certain number of workmen.     Exact information as to the number of employers who do not cover their risk by insurance is not  available.   We have, however, endeavoured to  collect material for a reasonable estimate and to discover whether any particular classes of employers abstain from insuring.     The question engaged the attention of the Departmental Committee appointed in 1907 to consider whether the  Post Office  should provide facilities for insurance under  the  Workmen&apos;s  Compensation Act.*  They refer to the  question  in the following terms:      &quot; Opinions have, however, been expressed to us that, whatever publicity may be &quot; given to the provisions of the Act, there will remain a considerable number of small &quot; employers who are either indifferent to their responsibilities or unwilling to make &quot; the sacrifice necessary to insure against the contingency of accident.  It is impos- &quot; sible to obtain complete figures upon this branch of the  question.   The Workmen&apos;s &quot; Compensation Act of 1897 was designed to embrace within its scope the large and &quot; well-organised branches of industry, and comparatively few small employers were &quot; included.  When the  provisions of the Act of 1897 were extended in 1900 to the (; agricultural industry,  a number of comparatively small farmers were for the first &quot; time  rendered liable.   The evidence that was tendered to us regarding the propor- &quot; tion of these who have neglected to insure was somewhat conflicting.    &quot; Almost equally conflicting was the evidence as  regards the disposition of other &quot; classes of  small employers  to  insure.  Mr. Dodgson,  Inspector of Factories  at (f Sheffield, expressed the opinion that a large number of the employers in the tene-&quot; ment factories at Sheffield would not insure their workmen under any circumstances,&quot; whilst Mr. Sydney Smith and Mr. Lauder, Inspectors  of Factories at Derby and r&apos; Aberdeen,  gave evidence of a different state of affairs in the districts of which they &quot; were cognisant.  Mr.  White, Secretary  of the National  Federation of Building &quot; Trade Employers, stated that evidence had come  under his  notice showing that &quot; out of a total of 1,000 fresh insurances, 18 per cent, were effected by persons not &quot; previously insured, though already liable.    &quot; There was, however, a general consensus of opinion amongst the witnesses  that, whatever  facilities are offered for insurance, there will always remain a &quot; residuum of small employers whom nothing short of a system of compulsion would &quot; induce to insure.&quot;    Evidence from witnesses before us who were competent to judge suggested that apart from large concerns the classes of employers who are now most frequentlyuninsured are the small builder, the small farmer, employers of casual labourers andthe employer with only one or two workmen.    The Home  Office has statistical information, which  we set out below, as to thenumber of uninsured employers in the seven groups of industries from which returns are received under Section 12 of the Act.   The &quot; uninsured &quot; employers in the seven groups of industries referred to are those employers who are not, as regards any partof their liability,  insured in one of the  Insurance  Companies or Mutual Indemnity Societies which supply the Home Office with collective returns  under Section 12 of the  Act on behalf of their insured.   All insurance  companies  and the majority of the   Mutual Indemnity  Societies  make  collective returns, but there are a few Mutual Indemnity Societies  the  members  of which   are left  to  make their own returns. There is  nothing in the returns to distinguish these employers from the   genuine uninsured,  and consequently  they  have to be  included  in  the number of  uninsured.    Enquiries,  however,  show  that the number  of  such employers is very small, so that  the number of uninsured employers  given below &apos;                               *  [Cel. 3568] 1907,

There are no figures showing  the number of uninsured employers outside the seven industries, but if the other industries include anything like the same propor-tion of uninsured employers (and this seems more than probable in view of the factthat these last-named industries include agriculture, building and domestic service),it would appear, having regard to the census figures, that the total number of unin-sured employers within the Act cannot be less than 250,000.    The next step in the enquiry is to endeavour to ascertain the extent to which theexistence of this body of uninsured employers jeopardises the workman&apos;s receipt ofhis accrued benefits.    Evidence of the extent to which compensation is unpaid  is by its very naturedifficult to collect.   It is the small employer who is most likely to be in default.  Heis protected from proceedings by his want of means, and  consequently  his defaultrarely emerges into the light of day.  No single witness was able to give evidenceof any  substantial number of cases  where compensation had been lost throughnon-insurance,  but  many  witnesses  gave evidence  of a certain  small numberof such cases which had come to their knowledge incidentally and not as  the re-sult of any particular enquiry. That cases occur where a  smaller sum than is dueis accepted by the workman, owing to the employer&apos;s threat of bankruptcy if thefull amount is  insisted on, or where claims are  not  pressed because the employer is not worth fighting, is beyond  dispute.   To ascertain their number is quite impossible.    The following passage in the evidence of Judge Ruegg,  K.C., as to the ex-perienoe of County Court Judges,  is striking evidence of hardships suffered by the workpeople of employers who are not qualified to carry their own risk :            &quot; I think they have nearly all had very hard cases of men who have failed      &quot; to get their compensation in consequence of the inability of the employer to      &quot; pay. I have had three cases myself that I should just like to mention,  if I      &apos; might, to the Committee.  Two of them, strangely enough, were window      &quot; cleaners, quite small men themselves, uneducated, and in a humble position.      &quot; In each case they employed a man to assist them.  I think one of these cases      &quot; was in Birmingham, the other in the Potteries.  In each case the man was29358B
           &quot; killed and left a widow and family.   I had to make an award in each case           &quot; for a considerable sum of money,  250 or  300, and the employer really had           &quot; nothing in each case.  One of these men is continually up before me on Judg-           &quot; ment Summons to pay 10s. on account, or  1 on account, and he has paid a           &quot; few pounds, but he will never pay the  250. In the other case I do not think           &quot; any attempt was ever made to pay.  Those are two cases of window cleaners.           &quot; The other was a case of a very small tradesman who really had nothing.  One           &quot; of his men was killed; he was uninsured; and in that case they asked me to           &quot; sanction a settlement for a very small sum of money,  30 or  40, absolutely           &quot; an inadequate sum; but it was put to me in this way : if I would sanction           &quot; that settlement his friends would come forward and find that  money, but           &quot; they would not find any more, and after going into it very carefully I was           &quot; satisfied that that was so, and I  had to sanction whether I had  power to           &quot; do so or not, I do not know the settlement in that case in order to  get what           &quot; one could for the  widow, which was a sum of  30 or  40&apos;.  In  these three           &quot; cases there was very great hardship,  all resulting from  the same  cause, of           &quot; course, that the man was uninsured and had no capital.&quot;         We are satisfied that cases arise where hardship occurs by the loss of compensa-     tion through the employees failure to insure, and we have been impressed by the     strong feeling which exists among workpeople that means should be found by which     such hard cases should be prevented.   We feel bound to take notice of that sense of     grievance.17       An  important consideration  to be taken  into  account  in this  connection     is the new position which will emerge should our recommendations as to benefits     be  adopted.   Those  recommendations  would  impose a  very  serious  liability     on employers possessing only a small capital.         We feel that the State would fail in its  duty if it imposed increased obligations     on  the employer without taking steps to  ensure that benefits provided for the     Workman should not become illusory.18       The obvious step is compulsory insurance, and no point throughout our enquiry     was supported by a stronger body of witnesses than this proposal.  Witnesses repre-     senting employers as well as workmen were in favour of it, and Judge Ruegg, K.C.,     speaking on behalf  of the whole of the County Court Judges, stated that they were     &quot;all of opinion  that there should be compulsory insurance.&quot; J         Compulsory insurance was  brought  much nearer when in  1906 the  principle     of the 1897 Act  which, speaking generally, confined liabilities to the large employer,     was abandoned.   The increased burden which it is now necessary to impose makes     compulsory insurance more pressing still. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain clearly foresaw     this ultimate  outcome  of measures  of which he was one  of  the first advocates.     Speaking on Mr. Asquith&apos;s Employees Liability Bill, he said,  &quot; In dealing with     &quot; compensation  I should be inclined to treat the employer merely as a convenient     &quot; channel through  which the compensation should be paid.  I should expect that     &quot; if the liability to nay compensation were made universal every employer Would     &quot; insure and I should not object to the amendment  ....  which seeks to make     &quot; it the duty of the employer to insure his men.&quot;*         By 1906 the real weakness in a  system  which  relied on voluntary insurance      to-aiTifft work-men&apos;s compensation  risk had emerged  more clearly  and was  thus     stated by the Home Secretary, Mr.  Herbert  Gladstone,  when introducing the Work-     men.&apos;s Compensation Bill of 1906 :  &quot; The  difficulty of small employers which     &quot; considerably hampered Parliament in 1897  is still with us.  There are a number     &quot; of small  workshops throughout the country and a number of  small employments     &quot; in which an employer is practically a  workman himself; and. as Hon.  Members     &quot; know, it is the small  employer who. as a  rule, neglects  to insure and  in cases of     &quot; serious iniurv is unable to pay very heaw compensation   ....  The ultimate     &quot; solution  of the whole question is probably to be found in a scheme of  compulsory   .  &quot; insurance &quot;t19      A further, matter of which we are  bound to take due note, is the  fact that     at  present considerably over  500,000  a  year is spent on  agents&apos;  commission     by   Insurance Companies  doing workmen&apos;s  compensation business.

    expenditure,  the  total of which cannot be estimated,  is incurred by them as a    consequence of their active competition for business.  It is clear that if  insurance    against workmen&apos;s compensation risk were compulsory much  of  this expense could    be saved.&apos;0       In our opinion, the foregoing arguments, taken together,  make out a  strong    case for requiring the employer-especially  the  smaller employer-to  cover  his    workmen&apos;s compensation risk by insurance.         On the other hand, arguments can be advanced against  compulsory  insurance    under the present system.  It was in the first place pressed upon us that no employer    should be compelled to insure with an Insurance Company that is admittedly making    a profit out of the business.   It has also to be recognised that those employers  who    are financially capable of carrying their own risk should be permitted to do so, and    it was urged that, to secure exception from  insurance, employers would have to    submit accounts disclosing their financial position to some authority competent to    judge whether exception could safely bcgranted. It was also urged that in the event    of a general system of compulsory insurance  the arrangements necessary  for its    enforcement would entail considerable expenditure.         We have arrived, at the conclusion that it is necessary for the protection of work-    men, and is not contrary to the interests of the employers themselves, that those  who    are unable safely to carry the risk should be compelled to insure.         We are satisfied from the evidence that all prudent employers, if not qualified    to carry their own risk, do already insure either with an insurance company or  in a    mutual association, and that  consequently it is only the improvident employer  who    would,  in  fact,  be made to  insure.  Further, the objection  to  requiring  the    employer to insure in an insurance  company trading for profit will to a considerable    extent  be met by the exercise of supervision over the rates of the companies as here-    herein after  suggested.         With regard to the larger employers who, at present, carry their own risk,    there is no question but that  they have in the past met  their  obligations under the    Act.  We are, therefore, of opinion that provision  can  properly be made whereby    this class of employer can obtain exception from the requirements of any compulsory    scheme without detailed investigation  into their financial position.         Lastly, in our view, it will not be necessary to incur any great expenditure in    the enforcement of compulsory insurance if compulsion is limited, as hereinafter    detailed, and provided arrangements can be made with  the Ministry of Health by    which  inspection  is undertaken by the officials who enforce  the provisions  of  the    National Health Insurance Scheme.                   SECTION 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.         State System of Insurance. It will be seen from the foregoing review that  the    main defects  disclosed in the present system are :-            (i) in the case  of insurance  with  insurance  companies, the absence of                 sufficient protection for the employer against excessive premiums;  -           (ii) in the  case of mutual  associations, the  absence of any guarantee that                 sufficient monies are  being set aside  each year  to  cover outstanding                 liabilities;           (iii) in the case  of self-insurers, the  danger to  the  injured workman of                 losing his  compensation owing to inability of  an  employer to meet                 his obligations.         We are of opinion that these defects can be largely  remedied without resort to    a State system of  insurance, though not without the introduction of  a  certain    measure of State control.         We do not, accordingly, recommend  the  establishment of a State system of    accident insurance. We, however, propose modifications in the existing system as    follows: !2       Insurance Companies. We recommend State supervision of rates of premium    with a view to the restriction of the expenses and profits of Insurance Companies    in workmen&apos;s compensation business,  in accordance with the arrangement agreed    with the Insurance Companies which is discussed below.         We  examined in  some  detail   the question  of the  proportion of   the    insurance premium that should reasonably be retained by the Insurance Companies       29358                                                                  B  2
      to cover  their working expenses and profits.   Tor the eight years  down  to and      including 1918, the management expenses of the  Companies  amounted to  19  per      cent, of their premium income, and they expended a further 12 per cent, of such      income in payment of commission to agents and brokers, thus  leaving 15 per cent.      of the said premium income for profit *  The representatives of the Companies      informed us that since 1918 working  expenses  generally have increased, and that      their management expenses now approximate to  25 per  cent, of their premium      income.          After prolonged and careful consideration  of all the circumstances we arrived      at the  conclusion that the management expenses,  payments  for  commission, and      profits of the Companies,  should not exceed 30 per cent,  of the premium income.      This proportion would leave 70 per cent, of the premium income for the provision      of benefits to workmen or their dependants under the Act.   We believe this is a more      economical arrangement than is to be found in the working of insurance companies      in any other country.          Having arrived at this conclusion, we met the  representatives of the Accident      Offices Association with a view  to making a working arrangement with the com-      panies by which  our conclusions  could be made  effective.   After extended negotia-      tions we succeeded in agreeing the heads of a working arrangement which are con-      tained in Appendix A. to this Report.  We then  consulted representatives of several      Non-Tariff Companies and ascertained that the said heads  of working arrangement      met with their approval. 23      The  effect of the arrangement is  that it  is proposed  that maximum rates  of      insurance against the risks under the  Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act shall be fixed      for triennial periods for each trade or group of  trades and that it shall not be per-      missible for any insurance company to charge an  employer any higher rate than that      fixed for  his  trade except  in cases where, in view of an  abnormally  high  claims      experience or exceptional  risk, a special rate may be authorised.   For the first      triennial period rates are to be formulated by the Accident Offices Association subject      to the approval of an official appointed for the purpose by the Government, who      is referred  to in  the working arrangement as  the proposed Commissioner, and any      difference between the Commissioner and the Accident Offices Association in regard      to the rates for this period is to be the subject of arbitration.   Thereafter it is      proposed that the rates should be fixed directly by the Commissioner, whose decision      would be final, but who would,  in arriving at  a decision, have the advice  of  an      Advisory Committee composed of an equal number of members appointed by him      and the  Accident Offices  Association respectively.  As  the  rates fixed will  be      maximum rates only and will be  based on the detailed experience of the companies      belonging to the Accident Offices  Association, it is contemplated that the Non-Tariff      Offices should not be represented  on the Advisory Committee, but that steps  should      be taken by the proposed Commissioner to elicit the views of the Non-Tariff Offices      on proposed variations in the rates before they are  finally determined upon.          The rates are to be such as will secure as nearly  as practicable a loss ratio  on      each trade or group of trades of 70 per cent., that is  to say, an expenditure of 70 per      cent, -of the premium income for the benefit of the workman, and if at the end of any      triennial period the rate of any particular trade or group of trades is found to have      resulted in a loss ratio exceeding or falling short of the 70 per cent, such rate will      be revised to secure as far as practicable a loss ratio of 70 per cent, during the next      triennial  period,  and also  to recover from or restore to insurers in that particular      trade or group of trades the amount by which the claims  in the preceding  period      exceeded or fell short of that percentage.  To avoid trifling and vexatious variations      in rates which have resulted in a loss ratio closely approximating to 70 per cent.,      a discretion is given to the proposed Commissioner to modify the  arrangement so      far as consistent with its general  principles.  Provision is also made in the working      arrangement to secure in  the event  of any large increase of  premiums after  the      first or any subsequent triennial  period an increase also in the percentage of loss      ratio on a fixed scale up to a possible maximum of  72^- per cent, and to enable the      Commissioner if he is  satisfied  that  the  actual and  reasonable working expenses   &apos;;   of the companies have so altered as to render  the percentage of loss ratio fixed  by      the scale impracticable or excessive, to adjust the same in an equitable manner.          We discussed with the representatives of the insurance companies the question      whether a percentage of the premium income should be allocated  for management&apos;&apos; &apos;fi&quot;   expenses  and  profits combined or whether expenses and profits should be dealt with      separately.   We came to the conclusion, with their concurrence, that in the interests      of all parties management expenses and profits  should be dealt with together both                               * See Tables at page 130 of this Report.&quot;
  for the sake of elasticity and for the purpose of maintaining a stimulus to compe-  tition, and that they should be fixed at 25 per cent.      As regards commission, it is proposed that the average commission of 13 to 15  per cent., which is at present paid,  should be reduced as nearly as possible to 5 per  cent, by a graduated scale of commission,  which we recommend should be given  statutory effect.      The  working arrangement  also contains a provision which is  necessitated  by  our proposals for compulsory insurance, to secure that such arrangements are made  as  will prevent any person requiring to be insured  from being unable to obtain  insurance.      In view of the higher percentage of claims cost which will now fall upon the  accident funds, it is considered necessary, in order to strengthen the funds, that  the reserves set up at the end of each year for unexoired risks should be increased to  45 per cent, of the premiums received during the year.  A reasonable time, not ex-  ceeding three years, should be allowed for attaining this standard.      It is also proposed to provide against outstanding liabilities by reserves which  are to be calculated in accordance with a uniform method applicable to all insurance companies and mutual associations.   The basis of this method should be formulated by  the Government Actuary, and prescribed by the proposed Commissioner.  We consider that the reserves for outstanding claims which have arisen under the present Act need  not necessarily be calculated  in accordance with the proposed method, provided that any deficiency which may ultimately be found in such reserves is made good from sources other than those derived under the new Act.      The interest earned by the Companies on the reserves for outstanding losses and unexpired risks has  been taken  into account in  arriving  at the financial basis of the  working arrangement.      For the purpose of giving effect to the working arrangement, and the recom- mendations of this Report, it will be necessary for returns to be periodically furnished by the insurance companies of  the premiums and claims in each group, and,  in the case of both insurance companies and mutual associations, of statistics as  to out- standing liabilities.      In short, it is provided by  the arrangement that in future         (i) At least  70  per cent, of  the  premium income  shall be expended in             benefits  to injured workmen or their dependants.        (ii) The remaining 30 per cent, of the premium income shall be available for             the management expenses or profits of the Companies, and the payment             of commission to agents; the latter  not  to exceed  5 per cent, of the             premium income in  any case.     We calculate  that in future there will thus  be saved on the present  cost to employers  a sum of between  1,250,000 and  1,500,000  a year, which under the existing organisation of  accident insurance, would be paid away in expenses of management,  commission and profits.     We desire to add that the representatives of the Insurance  Companies  though at all times fighting in their own legitimate interests, have reasonably endeavoured to assist us in arriving at a solution  of this difficult question.     There remains the question, by whom should supervision be exercised ?   This point was  prominently before us  during our negotiations with the Insurance Com- panies and the answer has more or less been anticipated  by reference to a Com- missioner in the above-mentioned  heads of a working arrangement and is dealt with at the end  of this section.     Mutual  Associations. We recommend  that  Mutual  Associations be  placed under the  same obligations as  Insurance Companies as to furnishing  returns and information, and that in respect of liabilities arising after the commencement of any new  Act the same requirements should be imposed upon Mutual Associations as to setting aside  funds to meet outstanding liabilities as is  imposed upon Insurance Companies.  We further  recommend that all Mutual Associations that collect pre- miums from their members  on the same lines as Insurance Companies (no further liabilities attaching to the members)  should be obliged to provide reserves for unexpired- pired risks as in the case of Insurance Companies.     Self-Insurers. In furtherance of the conclusions contained in  paragraph 20hereof, we recommend as follows :        (i)  That every employer other than  the Crown,  a local  or other  public            authority, a statutory company, or a householder in respect of servants            not employed by him for the purpose of his trade or business shall be            required to insure with an insurance company or in a mutual associa-            tion against workmen&apos;s compensation risk, unless  excepted  as here-            under provided.  29358                                                              B 3
       (II)  That every employer whose annual wage roll averages more than  20,000             over a period of three years, upon filing an application with the pro-             posed  Commissioner accompanied by (a) a declaration in a form to be             approved by the proposed Commissioner describing his trade or busi-             ness and verifying his wage roll and (b) a certified copy of his balance             sheet for his then last trading year, shall be entitled to exception from             insurance  unless in the  opinion of the proposed Commissioner good             grounds exist to the contrary.    We do not think it  necessary that these exceptions should be renewed annually,but power  should be reserved to the proposed Commissioner to review them  in his discretion at any time.    We should explain that the principal reasons for excluding the householder are that (a) the risks of accident to his servants have from experience proved to be remote,as is illustrated by the fact that the premium charged by insurance companies forthis class of risk  is  more or less nominal, and (b) the cost: and difficulty of enforce-ment would be so great as to be out of all proportion to the risk of loss to the personsinvolved.  We were informed that a large proportion of householders already cover,this risk by insurance and we have little doubt that when  the proposed  increasedliabilities are effective, few will be so unwise as to fail to insure.    With regard to the  enforcement of compulsory insurance, we recommend  that asubstantial penalty should be provided for default&quot;; that the  proposed commissioner should be responsible for enforcing  the Act against defaulters, and that he shouldmake arrangements for inspection with the Ministry of Health or any other Depart-ment of the State whose officers can conveniently in the course of their ordinaryduties assist in the detection of  defaulters.    A uthority to Exercise Control. We think it essential that the control of the ratesof premium of  insurance companies and the supervision of mutual associations and self -insurers should be in the hands of a single official, whom  for the sake of convenience-ence and not with a view to denoting the status to be given to this official we refer toin this  Report under the? designation of  Commissioner.    We further think it important that various other functions in connection with workmen&apos;s compensation should be concentrated in this official.  We deal with this point more fully in para-graph 107 of this Report.   The Commissioner must, in our judgment, act under oneof the Departments of State, so that  a Minister can be responsible  to parliament for his acts.    To enable the proposed Commissioner to secure and exercise the necessary control,we recommend  that no Insurance Company or Mutual Association should be per-mitted to conduct workmen&apos;s compensation business, except  under a licence (renew-able annually)  from the Commissioner.   Statutory  provisions which  will ensuresatisfactory compliance with the relevant requirements of the  Act and Regula-tions made thereunder  (at the risk of a withdrawal  of the licence to transact thebusiness) will be necessary.                                  PART III.            INJURIES WITHIN  THE  SCOPE  OE THE ACT.    To sustain a claim under the Act for personal injury it is necessary to showthat the injury was sustained as a result of        (i) An &quot; accident arising out of and in the course of the employment,&quot; or       (ii) One of the  industrial diseases brought specially within the scope of             the Act.SECTION 1-DEFINITION OF &quot; ACCIDENT ARISING OUT OF AND JN THE COURSE OF THE                                EMPLOYMENT.&quot;    The meaning of  the term &quot; accident &quot; is now well settled by judicial interpreta-tion, and no objection has been made, so far as we can ascertain, to the construction which has been placed upon the word.  In the earlier cases, the  Court of Appealheld that the idea  of  something &quot; fortuitous and unexpected&quot;  was  involved inthe term &quot; accident.&quot;   The House of Lords,  however, have applied a construction which  is more favourable to the workman.  In the words of Lord Macnaghten, inFenton v. Thorley $  Co. [1903], A.C. 443, at p. 448 : &quot; The expression &apos; accident&apos;is used in the popular and ordinary sense of the word as denoting an unlooked-formishap or  an untoward event which is  not  expected or  designed.&quot;   By a latercase this  definition was  extended  and it  was  decided that  the  mishap oroccurrence must be looked  at  from the workman&apos;s standpoint and that whatever
 its cause or origin it will be treated as accidental unless designed by the workmanhimself.   (Trim Joint  District School v. Kelly [1914] A.C. 667.)  This definition has been held to be wide enough to include such extreme cases as heat-stroke; chill developing  into inflammation of the kidneys; the  rupture of  an aneurism in so advanced a state that  it might have burst during  sleep; and murder.   While an &quot; accident &quot; must be due to some particular  occurrence at some particular time, this condition does not necessarily exclude disease.   For example, a workman con- tracted anthrax.   It was found that at a particular time a bacillus from infected avooI which he was sorting had alighted on a susceptible spot, namely, the eye,  and set up the complaint.  These circumstances were held to constitute an &quot; accident.&quot; And in the case of Grant v. Kynoch (1919), 12 B.W.C.C.  78, the death of  a workman who had contracted blood poisoning set up by germs gaining access through a scratch in the leg, was decided by the House of Lords to have been due to &quot; accident.&quot;   In that case it was impossible to say with certainty when the infection occurred, but the Lord  Chancellor  observed that while it was essential that there should be &quot; some &quot; particular occurrence happening at some particular time  ....  what that &quot; particular time was is immaterial  so long as it reasonably appears that it was in &quot; the course of the employment.&quot;   Diseases of gradual onset such as lead poisoning &quot; are on a different footing.  These cases are not &quot; accidents,&quot; because they are not traceable  to any particular occurrence in the course of the employment.    For success in a claim for compensation,  however,  it must be established thatthe workman not only suffered &quot; personal injury by accident &quot; but also that it was an accident &quot; arising out of and in  the course of the employment.&quot;  These wordswere the foundation of the 1897  Act and were reproduced unaltered in the 1906&apos;Act.   It is safe to say that no other form of words has ever given rise to such a bodyof litigation, and Trade Union witnesses complained of certain hard cases in which compensation had been denied on the ground that the  accident occurred outsidethe injured workman&apos;s employment.   We have accordingly carefully  considered whether the law should be amended.    An examination of the numerous decisions of which the words in question havebeen the subject suggests that on the whole a liberal view of their meaning has been applied. Thus, when the place and circumstances of a workman&apos;s employment involvespecial risk and an accident occurs, the injury sustained by the workman is deemedto have been caused by accident arising  &quot; out of  &quot; the employment, even  though the agency causing the injury is external to the employment.   For instance, where abricklayer was struck by lightning when working on a  scaffold, and a cashier wasmurdered on the  railway while carrying a bag of money belonging to his firm,compensation was awarded.    The only modification of the phrase  which has  found any appreciable body of support is the suggestion of several of the  County Court Judges that the words&quot; arising out of &quot; should be deleted,  and that  the accident  should be the subject ofcompensation if it arose simply   in the course of the  employment.&quot;  This formof words &quot; would embrace then every accident that occurred during the time thatthe relationship of master and servant could be  said to  be subsisting, and all theseextremely nice questions  which have troubled  all the  Courts,  as  to  whether  aparticular  accident arose out of  a  risk incidental to  the employment, would be eliminated.&quot;*  The witnesses who  represented  the views of &quot;the Accident OfficesAssociation were of the same opinion. The &quot;&quot;general view,&quot; however, of  the county court Judges, who considered these words collectively, was that &quot; as there must be some limiting words, and as those words have received  judicial construction overand over again, it would be wiser that they should be retained rather thai? that anjfresh  form of words should be substituted.&quot;t    It is not without significance that  other States which hava in. recent yearsadopted  workmen&apos;s compensation legislation have imported  the  classic  Britishphrase.  In the United States, for  instance, an injury, to  be the subject of com-pensation, must in all the States happen  in the course of the employment, and in allbut four of the States it must also, as in this country, arise out of, or result from, theemployment.    The phrase &quot; arising out of and in the course of the employment &quot; has been thesubject of so much judicial consideration that its meaning is well settled, and werecommend that the words should remain unaltered.    Our attention has  been  directed to the decision of the  House of Lords in Maylast in the case of Bourton v. Beauchamp &amp; Beauchamp [1920] W.N. 214, whereby itwas held, following the earlier case in  the House  of Lords of the Lancashire  &amp;Yorkshire Railway Company v. Highley [1917] A.C. 352, that where a workman            * Ruegg 10,195.S9358f Ruegg, 10,191.                     Bl
     was fatally injured in a coal mine whilst doing that which was neither lawful for his     employers to employ him to do nor lawful for him to do under his contract with his     employers, the injury suffered by the workman in the course of that work was not an     accident that arose out of and in the course of his employment.   It was argued  in     favour  of the  workman  that  the  circumstances  in  question  brought  him     within section 1 (2) (e) of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of 1906,  because his     injury was attributable, putting it at the highest against him, to his serious and     wilful misconduct,  and that pursuant to the provisions of  that  sub-section his     dependants ought not to be deprived of the benefits payable under the Act in case of     his death, and  we were invited to make a recommendation that words should  be     inserted in any amending Act giving the workman or his dependants the benefit of     the last-mentioned sub-section in such circumstances.  We have considered all the     decisions of the House of Lords and  the Court of Appeal upon this  subject, which     are to the effect that if a workman is doing work that he is employed to do in an     irregular or improper way he is not, in case of  serious  injury,  disqualified from the     benefits of the Act, but that if he meets with an accident whilst doing some act which     he was not employed to do,  he cannot  recover  compensation.   The  question to  be     decided is &quot; Was  it part of the injured person&apos;s employment to hazard, to suffer, or     to do that which  caused his injury?  If yea, the  accident arose out  of his employ-     ment.  If nay,  ft did not.&quot;t  In our opinion no change is desirable in this respect.                           SECTION 2. INDUSTRIAL  DISEASES.               Sub-section 1. Application of the Act to Scheduled Diseases.30       As stated above, the Act applies to cases of disease which can be shown to have     been due to a particular occurrence at a  particular time.   The Act also  applies     .with certain modifications  (Section 8),  to  cases of  death or  incapacity  caused     by any industrial disease or injury specified  in the  Third  Schedule  to  the  Act     or added thereto by Order of the Secretary of  State.   The diseases specified in the     Third Schedule number six only, but this list has been greatly enlarged by Orders of     the Secretary of State, and now includes about five times that number.  It. covers not     only well-known  industrial  diseases  such as anthrax, lead poisoning and  miners&apos;     nystagmus, but also various diseases of rare occurrence such as compressed, air illness     and poisoning by  nickel carbonyl.   The list is in the main based on the results of an     exhaustive inquiry carried out by a Departmental Committee which was appointed by     the Home Secretary during the passage of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill of 1906     under the chairmanship of Mr. Herbert Samuel,  M.P., then Parliamentary  Under-     Secretary of State  at the Home Office,* but it has since from time to time been     extended for example, writers&apos; cramp was added to the Schedule on the recom-     mendation of another Committee appointed in April,  1912, and during  the  War,     forms of poisoning by tetrachlorethane and other poisonous materials  used in the     manufacture of munitions  were included on the advice of Dr. Legge, the Senior     Medical Inspector of Factories.          One or two witnesses have suggested  the establishment of a permanent expert     authority to advise the Home Office as to  the diseases and injuries to be scheduled     under the Act,  but in view of the exhaustive inquiries made into the subject, there     hardly appears to be any sufficient need for the creation of any such machinery.     The list of scheduled diseases will no doubt require in future, as in the past, to be   -  extended and amended from time to time, but we think that the procedure which     has hitherto  been adopted by the Home Office of arranging for special inquiry as     the occasion arises, either by a Committee or an expert Medical Officer, should suffice.          No complaints have been made  to us as to  the action of the Home Office in     excluding or including any  particular  diseases, but it was strongly represented by     Mr.  Gillhespy, on  behalf  of the  Yorkshire mineowners,  that - the compensation     payable to a workman disabled by miners&apos; nystagmus  should be limited to a period     of six months.   Mr. Gillhespy  produced remarkable  figures  showing the increase     in the number, and the prolonged duration, of  cases of miners&apos; nystagmus in  a     Yorkshire pit.  The suggested limitation appears to us to be inadmissible if, as we     gather, is the case, a workman suffering from miners&apos; nystagmus is not infrequently     disabled for a longer period than six months; but as the Home Office statistics show,     there has been  a  surprising increase in the claims for compensation on account of     this disease.  We suggest for the consideration of the Home Office that  some special     inquiry in the matter would be desirable.         * See Reports of the Committee on Compensation for Industrial Diseases of May, 1907 (Cd. 3495)     and October, 1908 (Cd. 4386).

     In addition to the diseases scheduled under the Act of 1906, one important indus-trial disease that known as fibroid phthisis or  silicosis which is  caused  by theinhalation of certain kinds of siliceous dust, has been dealt with recently by special legislation.  &quot;Under the Workmen^ Compensation (Silicosis) Act of 19,18,  power isgiven to the Home Office to make schemes on special lines to provide for the paymentof compensation in the case of any workman engaged in any specific industry or pro-cess who is certified to  have been killed or disabled by silicosis or to be so affected bythe disease as to make it dangerous for him to continue in the employment; and underthese provisions a Scheme has been made for the Refractories Industries (mining andquarrying ganister rock and the making of ganister or  silica bricks).  Silicosis was recognised by the Departmental Committee of 1906 as &quot; a specific and sufficiently dis-tinguishable trade disease,&quot; but the Committee were unable to recommend its inclusionunder the Act of 1906 for two reasons, first, that owing to the slow development of the disease great difficulty  would be experienced in the case of workmen who had movedabout  from one employment to another,  in  apportioning  the  liability among thedifferent employers; and, secondly, that in order to escape the serious personal liabilitywhich might be incurred under the Act, employers would be  tempted to discharge anyworkman showing symptoms of any respiratory disease, e.g,, a workman  sufferingfrom a cough or attack of bronchitis, whether he was or was not affected by silicosis.The scheme for the Refractories Industries gets over these difficulties by establish-ing  a  General Compensation  Fund  (administered by a  Mutual Association ofEmployers)  to  which all the employers in the  industries  affected are  required tocontribute and  which takes over the whole of the personal liabilities and rights ofthe  contributing  employers.  Thus the burden of  compensation is  borne by theindustry as a whole  and no question of apportioning the  liability among  differentemployers arises.  The scheme  contains other special features, e.g., it provides fora system of medical examination and suspension from employment, which is  designedto secure the elimination from the industries of any workmen showing signs of butnot yet incapacitated by the disease, and sets up for each district a local committeerepresenting employers and workmen with an independent chairman with power tosettle all questions (other than medical) arising under the scheme.  It is an interest-ing experiment, but it  has not  yet been sufficiently long in operation to permit ofany final opinion on its  working.  Sub-section 2. Proposals to  extend the Act to any disease attributable to the                                  employment.     In determining whether or not a particular disease or injury should be scheduledunder  the Act  it has always been regarded as  an essential condition,  for reasons give in the first report of the Departmental Committee of  1906 (see passage quotedbelow), that the disease or injury must be so specific  to  the employment that itscausation by the employment can be  established  in individual cases.  Hence notonly have the ordinary diseases or injuries which  are common to all humanity  been excluded,  but also many diseases which are specially prevalent among workers inparticular industries but which are not so specific to the trade that they can withany  certainty be attributed to the employment in particular cases.  Several  of the witnesses  before us have proposed that this requirement should be abandoned andthe Act extended  to every case of  disease or injury which can  be  shown  to the satisfaction of the Court to be due to the employment.   This subject was dealt with at length in the following passage from the Report of the Departmental Committeeof May, 1907 (see page  2) :-     &quot; Many diseases may  be regarded as  trade diseases, and  rightly so regarded,&quot; because they are known to be  specially prevalent among the workers in particular&quot; industries; but they may not  be specific  to the trade, since they may frequently,&quot; although more seldom, attack persons engaged in other occupations.    Bronchitis,&quot; for example, is a trade disease  among flax-workers; a larger proportion of that class&quot; suffer from it than of other people; but  it is not specific to the employment, for&quot; numbers of persons who are not flax-workers contract it also.   Unless there is some&quot; symptom which differentiates the  bronchitis due to dust from the ordinary type,&quot; it is  clearly impracticable  to  include it as  a subject of compensation; for no one&quot; can tell, in any individual case, whether the flax-worker with bronchitis was one of&quot; the hundreds of persons in the town whose bronchitis  had no  connection with&quot; dust  irritation, or whether he was one of the additional  tens or scores of persons&quot; whose illness  was due to that cause.   To ask a court of law to decide would be to&quot; lay upon it an impossible task.  If the workman were required  to prove his case,&quot; he might be able to show that a larger percentage of his trade suffer from bronchitis
&quot; than do the rest of the population, but he could never show that he himself was a&quot; unit in the excess, and not in the normal part, of that percentage.  If it were&quot; the  employer who was required to disprove a claim, he could narery, if ever, show&quot; that the workman did not contract the  illness through his employment,  and he&quot; would be compelled to compensate not only those labourers whose bronchitis had&quot; a trade origin, but also all those whose bronchitis was in no degree an industrial&quot; disease.  We gather from the debates in Parliament that it was  a recognition&quot; of this necessity of some means of deciding in individual  cases whether or not&quot; the disease was due to the  employment, which decided the Legislature not to open&quot; the  door to claims from workmen suffering from any disease, as the door is open&quot; to claims on the score of any accident, but to proceed by way of scheduling those&quot; diseases which  can,  in any  given case, be differentiated  as  due to the  special&quot; conditions of a trade.&quot;    We  agree with the foregoing observations.   The extension of the Act to cover any disease or injury which is not specific to the employment, would, we are satisfied,give rise to constant and irritating disputes and involve employers and workersin a great deal  of costly and fruitless litigation  and would not, except in rareinstances, secure any benefit to  the disabled workman.   Subsection 3. Special Conditions applying to Recovery of Compensation for                               Industrial Disease.    The right of  the  worker  to claim, and the liability of  the employer  to pay,compensation for industrial disease are subject, under Section 8 and the Regula-tions  made by the Secretary of State thereunder, to certain special conditions whichpartly adapt, partly amend,  the general scheme of the Act.  Thus :       (1) Before he can recover compensation, the workman must either  have been             certified by the Certifying Surgeon appointed under the Factory and             Workshop Act, 1901, for the district in  which he is employed, to be             suffering from the disease and disabled thereby from earning full             wages, or have been suspended from his employment by the Certifying             or other appointed  Factory Surgeon in pursuance of some special Rules             and Regulations under the Factory Act on account of his having con-             tracted the disease.       (2) Any employer or workman aggrieved by the action of a Certifying  or             other Surgeon in giving or refusing to give a certificate of disablement             or suspending or refusing to suspend a workman, may appeal to the             Medical  Referee, whose decision is final.       (3)  The disease must be due to the nature of some employment in which the             workman has  been employed within the twelve months previous to the             date of disablement or suspension, and the employer on whom the claim             for compensation must be made is the employer who last employed the             workman in  that employment.   That  employer,  however,  is  not             liable on proof  that  the disease was  in fact  not  contracted in his             employment, or if he can prove that it was gradually contracted partly             in his employment and partly in the employment of another employer             within the twelve  months, he may require that other employer to bear             his proper share of the payment of the compensation.       (4)  Processes specially liable to give  rise to the scheduled diseases are  set             opposite to the  diseases in the second column of the  schedule,  and             where a worker suffering from a  scheduled disease was employed  at             or immediately before the date of his disablement or suspension in a             process set opposite the disease, then the disease is deemed to be due to             the  nature  of the employment unless the surgeon,  certifies or the             employer proves to the contrary.  As a result of this provision, the             burden of proof, in the question whether or not  the disease has been             due to the employment, is in the  bulk  of the cases shifted from the             workman to the employer.   Any workman, in whatever occupation  he             may  be engaged, can of course claim compensation in respect of any             scheduled disease, but  if he has not been employed  in a scheduled             process,  the onus of proof remains with him.      These provisions have  raised several difficult questions involving litigation, and they can, we think, be improved in several directions, but on a general review of the evidence we consider that they  have, on the whole, worked  satisfactorily, and have.
      effectively met the objections previously felt in many quarters to the application of      the Act to industrial diseases, and that there is consequently no need for any radical      revision of procedure. 33      Proposals have been made for simplifying the procedure either (a) by allowing      the certificate of any duly qualified  medical practitioner-subject  to appeal to the      Medical Referee-to be substituted for the certificate of the Certifying Surgeon, or      (b) by abolishing the right of appeal to a Medical Referee.  We are not in favour of      either proposal.   As regards the former, there can be no doubt that the requirement      of a certificate from an independent medical practitioner  is an effective safeguard      against disputes and  litigation, and the Certifying  Surgeons appear to have satis-      factorily performed their  duties  under the  section.  As  Dr. Dearden, who  gave      evidence on behalf of the  Certifying Surgeons5 Association, has pointed out, the      proportion of cases in which there has been a successful appeal to the Medical Referee      against the action of the Certifying Surgeon  is small.   We entertain no doubt that      if the requirement in question  was dispensed with and a certificate from any  duly      qualified medical practitioner accepted, both the total  number of  appeals and the      proportion of successful appeals would be  enormously increased.  At the same time      it should, we think, be possible  for the employer, in a considerable number of cases,      to dispense with the certificate of  the Certifying Surgeon and to  agree to pay com-      pensation on the report either  of  his own or the workman&apos;s doctor or of  a  doctor      selected by mutual arrangement.  It is not clear, however, that the workman would      have any power under  the Act to enforce any such agreement.  We recommend that      the  section should be amended  so as  to make  it clear that a binding agreement can      in such circumstances be arrived at under the Act.          As regards the latter proposal, namely, the abolition  of the appeal to the Medical      Referee, we do not; think this would be desirable, having regard to the  wide variety      of disease to which the Act applies, and the great difficulty of diagnosis in certain      cases.   Moreover, if the Certifying Surgeon  was to be empowered  to give a final      decision, it would  be necessary to provide full  opportunity  in every  case for the      employer to bring any medical or other evidence he might  desire before the Certifying      Surgeon, and this would, necessarily  involve considerable delay to the  great  disad-      vantage of the workman.          It is desirable that recourse should not be had too lightly to the right of appeal.      It is pointed out in the covering memorandum to the Home Office Workmen&apos;s Com-      pensation Statistics for the  year 1913 (page 15), that  &quot; the number of appeals under      &quot; Section 8 in Scotland is remarkable and points to some  abuse by Scottish employers      &quot; of the power given by the Act.  192 appeals were taken by employers (as compared      &quot; with 133 in England and Wales) and only 27 succeeded.&quot;  No appeal was taken by      workmen.  These figures, which  are  confirmed by more recent  returns, indicate      over-readiness on the part  of the  Scottish employer  to  avail himself of the right      of appeal.   We trust this will cease; otherwise, in our view, steps should be taken to      prevent its continuance.34       It has been  suggested  that the functions of the Certifying  Surgeon  and the      Medical  Referee  might be enlarged by giving them  power to decide in every case     whether or not the disease is due to the employments  This proposal cannot be enter-      tained.    It  would mean that  before giving  a certificate a Certifying  Surgeon     and, on appeal, the Medical Referee, would have to investigate all the facts bearing     on the origin of the disease and sift:  the evidence, a  task which is entirely outside     their scope.  The question is clearly one that  can only be properly decided in most     cases by a judicial tribunal.35      A further important suggestion was made to enlarge the powers of the Medical     Referee by authorising him not merely to decide the  matter at present referred to     him, for instance, whether or not the workman was suffering from the disease at the     time when he was examined  by the Certifying Surgeon, but also to pronounce on the     actual condition of the workman at the time he is examined by the Referee.   Cases     occur in which the workman, although disabled by the disease at the time when the        * Where the&apos;caseiis onedn which under the provisions of Section  8 (2) the disease would be     deemed to he due to the nature of the employment, unless the  Certifying Surgeon certifies  or the     employer proves to the contrary/it is the duty of the Certifying Surgeon if he is of opinion that the     disease was not due to the nature  of the employment, to certify accordingly ; but the  effect of such     certificate is merely to remove the presumption in favour of the  workman-it still remains open to     the workman to prove before the  arbitrator that  the disease  has  been due to  the nature  of the     employment.
     Certifying Surgeon gave his certificate, has recovered by the time, he is examined by     the Referee, or conversely, where the Referee finds that the workman, although not     suffering from the disease at the time when the Certifying Surgeon&apos;s certificate was     given, is so suffering at the time of his examination by tne Keieree.  It would, we     think, assist the parties, and tend to prevent disputes, if the Referee was directed to     add to his decision on appeal a certificate (which should be conclusive) as to the     actual condition of the workman as ascertained by and at the time of his examina-     tion, and we recommend that the section should be amended accordingly.36      The Certifying Surgeon is not empowered to give a  certificate of disablement     after the workman has recovered from the disease, and Dr.  Dearden informed us that     cases still not infrequently arise where the workman, through ignorance of the special     procedure,  neglects to apply to the Certifying Surgeon until it is too late.  In order     to guard against any such occurrence, we suggest that it should  be made compulsory     for  an employer in such cases as the proposed  Commissioner may direct, to exhibit     on his premises a notice (to be combined with the notice hereinafter suggested see     paragraph 78 as to notification of accidents) directing the attention of the workman     to the application of the Act to the scheduled  diseases and the special steps to  be     taken for the purpose of claiming  compensation.  The workman should  then have     no difficulty if need arises in obtaining any further information necessary either     from his Trade Union or Approved Society or (if the suggestion made elsewhere in     this Report is approved) by application to  the Registrar of the  County Court.37      The, provisions governing the  liability of employers  under this section have     been somewhat differently  interpreted by the Courts in England  and Scotland     (owing to divergence of opinion in regard to the meaning of  the words &quot; due  to     the  nature of the employment &quot;). In England, the Court of Appeal has held (Dean     v. Rubian Art Pottery Co., Ltd. [1914] 2 K.B. 213) that  an employer can in every     case escape liability by proving that the disease was not due in whole or in part to     the  employment of the workman while in his service.  In Scotland,  the Court  of     Session have apparently taken the view (McGowan v. Merry &amp;  Cunninghame, Ltd.     (1915), S.C. 34; 8 B.W.C.C., p. 344; McTaggart v. William Barr &amp; Sons (1915),     S.C. 224; 8 B.W.C.C., p. 376; Docherty v. Archibald Russell, Ltd. (1918), S.C. 115;     11 B.W.C.C., p. 31), that where the workman has been employed at or immediately     before the date of disablement or suspension in a process set opposite to the disease     in the schedule, the employer  cannot escape liability, except by  showing either that     the  disease was not due to the workman&apos;s employment in that process, either while     in his service or in the service of other employers, or by joining some other employer     as a party  to the  arbitration and proving that the disease was in fact contracted     while the workman was in the service of that other employer.  We recommend that     the  section  should be amended so as to make it clear that  an employer is not liable     if he can prove that the disease was not due in whole or in part to the employment     of the workman while in his service.     Sub-section 4. Subordinate points arising  on Section 8 and Regulations thereunder.gg      We proceed to deal with certain subordinate points which have been raised under     the provisions of the section and Regulations :                     .  -           (a)  Under Section 8 (1) (ii) a claim for compensation arises if  the workman                 is suspended from his usual employment in pursuance of any Special                 Rules  and Regulations under the Factory  and  Workshop  Act on                 account of his having contracted one of the scheduled diseases.  These                 suspensions take place at periodic medical examinations of the workers,                 which are carried out sometimes by the Certifying Surgeon and some-                 times by  an &quot; appointed &quot; surgeon.  The appointment of these latter                 surgeons is subject to approval by the Home Office, but they are  in                 fact  appointed by the employer, who can at  any time terminate their                 engagement, and Dr.  Dearden suggested that in  these circumstances                 the workman cannot have the necessary confidence in the decisions  of                 the appointed surgeons, and that compensation should not be  payable                 on a certificate from  an appointed surgeon, but only on a certificate                 from a Certifying Surgeon.    We  doubt whether there is any  real                 ground for this apprehension no complaint on this point has reached                 us from  any other quarter,  and it appears from the Home Office                 statistics that cases in which the appointed surgeon has refused, on                 application, to suspend a workman are rare.  Moreover, the work-                 man^  right to  apply  for suspension, with a view to  compensation, is
      in addition to, and not exclusive of, his right to apply to the Certifying      Surgeon for a  certificate of disablement.   We  do  not,  therefore,      recommend any  alteration.(b)  The Certifying Surgeons are remunerated for their services by fees pay-    .  able by the workmen and employers.    The ordinary  fee where a      workman applies for a certificate of disablement is a fee of 5s., which      is payable  by the workman,  and which  he is required to  tender on      presenting  himself for examination.  Dr.  Dearden stated  that, not-      withstanding the smallness of this fee, the workman often  applies to      the Certifying Surgeon without the fee, that the  surgeon  makes his      examination without  insisting upon payment, and that he  finds him-      self unable, after the examination, to recover the  fee.  Dr. Dearden      suggested that the Certifying Surgeons  should be entitled to charge      these  fees to the employers.   That would hardly be reasonable, how-      ever, in cases where the  workman is found by the surgeon not to be      suffering from the disease and is refused a certificate of disablement,      and it is  important that some  check should  be maintained against      frivolous  applications.    We  consider  that  the workman   should     . continue to be charged a fee, payable in advance, in  respect of any      examination  made at  his   request, but  that where a  certificate      of disablement  is granted,  and is  not  upset by  a decision of the      Medical Referee, or where the Medical  Referee allows an appeal by      the workman against  the refusal of the  Certifying Surgeon to grant      a certificate of disablement, the fee should be repayable to the work-      man by the employer.  Provision should be made for this when the      scale  of fees for the  Certifying Surgeon &apos;s duties under the section      is revised.(c)  Section 8 (4) provides that the date of disablement shall be such date as      the Certifying Surgeon certifies  as the date on which the disablement      commenced, or, if he is unable to certify such a date, the date on which      the certificate  is given.  It  has  been represented  on  behalf  of      employers&apos;  associations  that  the Certifying Surgeon  should not be      empowered to fix a date  prior to the date of his certificate, or at any      rate not beyond  one week previously, on  the ground that the surgeon      is not in a position to fix any such date,  and that the workman ought      to apply to the surgeon for a certificate as soon as  his  disability com-      mences.  Cases occur where  a workman  is not aware of the precise      cause  of his disability until  some  time  after  its commencement,  and      in view of the fact that  in certain industrial diseases  it is sometimes      possible at  a later date to specify a date  in the past when the disease      must  have  been  of a  disabling  character,  we see  no reason why the      Certifying  Surgeon should not be allowed in such cases, as  a result of      his own examination, supplemented by a certificate from the workman&apos;s      doctor, to fix a previous date.  Any date fixed by the Certifying Sur-      geon is subject always to appeal to the Medical Referee (see Frost v.      Clanwary Colliery Co., Ltd.  [1920] 1 K.B. 423).   We  advise that the      discretion at present  given to the Certifying Surgeon should  not be      interfered with.(d)  Difficulties sometimes arise owing to the issue by the Certifying  Surgeon      of a certificate in irregular  form, e.g.,  the particular disease  is not      described in the certificate in such a way as  to identify it with the      scheduled disease.  In some  instances of this kind the employer has      appealed to the  Medical  Referee, who has felt bound,  in view  of the      technical flaw, to allow the appeal.  In  other instances the employer      has simply declined to pay compensation, and  when the workman has      taken proceedings in court  to recover compensation,  the Judge has      been constrained to dismiss the application (see Chippendale  v. High      Explosives, Ltd., of Lytham  (1918),  120  L.T.  9).   In such cases sub-      stantial hardship may result, as by the time the case has been deter-      mined by the Referee or  the  Court the workman may have  recovered,      and not be entitled therefore  to apply to the Certifying Surgeon for a      fresh  certificate.          We recommend, first, that appeals to the Medical  Referee  on the      ground of some technical irregularity or  flaw  in the form of the cer-
      certificate should not be permitted, and that it should be the duty of the      Registrar (as No. 10 of the existing Regulations appears to contem-      plate) to scrutinise carefully every  application for an appeal, and if      he finds the certificate irregular in form, to  return the certificate to      the Certifying Surgeon for amendment and  notify the  parties.   We      further recommend that in any case where a certificate has been given      in an irregular form it should be open to the Certifying Surgeon at      any time to issue a corrected certificate.(e)  Under the Regulations, the period for lodging an appeal to the Medical      Referee is fixed at seven days, but power is given to the Registrar of      the County Court (through whom the application is made) to extend      this  period by not more than seven days on  good cause shown.   It      has been strongly urged by employers that a period of seven days is      insufficient to enable them to make inquiries and to arrange if necessary      for the examination of the workman by their own doctor,  and that      the period should be extended in every  case to fourteen days.  On      the other  hand,  any such extension  would  increase the  delay that      arises in the  payment of  compensation  in cases  of  appeal  and      would aggravate  the difficulty which the Medical  Referee already      experiences in many cases in arriving at a decision owing to the lapse      of time between  the examination of the workman by the Certifying      Surgeon and his own examination.  On the whole we are in favour of      the period being extended from seven to ten days.(/)  It has been decided by the  Court of Session  in Scotland that a workman      is not debarred by the fact that he has  not  obtained a certificate of      disablement from initiating proceedings  for  the recovery of  compen-      sation, provided  that  the necessary  certificate is  forthcoming pre-      viously to the determination of the proceedings (Taylor v. Burnham      &amp; Co. 2 B.W.C.C. 247).  We think that the intention of the section was      that  the certificate should be obtained before any  proceedings were      instituted, and suggest that the section  might be amended to make      this clear.(g)  According to the Form  at present  prescribed  for the  decision of the      Medical Referee  for an appeal  (Form 15) a  Medical Referee is not      required to  do more than state whether he  dismisses or allows the      appeal, and where he allows an appeal against a refusal of a certifi-      cate of disablement by the Certifying Surgeon, to fix the date of the      commencement of the disablement.  An appeal may, however, involve      two or three distinct questions whether the workman is or is not      suffering  from the scheduled disease, whether or not he  is  disabled      by it, and whether the  date of disablement, if any,  fixed by the  Certi-      fying Surgeon is  correct, and the Form has been criticised in the Courts      and elsewhere on  the ground of vagueness.  We think that the Referee      should be  required to give his decision on each separate point referred      to him and suggest that an opportunity should be taken to revise the      Form accordingly.(h)  Under section 8 (1)  (c) (iii) any contributions due from other employers      to the employer primarily responsible for the payment of compensa-      tion must in default of agreement be determined &quot;  in the arbitration      under this Act for settling the amount of compensation.&quot;   There may,      however, be no dispute between the employer primarily responsible and    .  the workman  as  to the amount of compensation and  consequently no      need  for any arbitration, and in such case the expedient has apparently      been  for the last-named employer to create a fictitious dispute between      himself and the workman  by not paying the workman the full amount      of the compensation due, in order to bring about an arbitration.  This      should obviously  be remedied; and we recommend that the provision      in question should be amended so as to provide a means of determining      the contributions payable by other employers by  proceedings under      the Act without making the workman a party.
                                      PART IV.              PERSONS  ENTITLED TO RECEIVE  COMPENSATION. 39       The persons to whom compensation may become payable are :             (i) In the case of a non-fatal accident: The injured workman.            (ii) In the case of a fatal accident::  The dependants of the deceased workman.          The expressions &quot; workman &quot; and &quot; dependants &quot; are the subject of statutory      definition in. the Act, and have also been the subject of judicial decision.          SECTION 1. WHO ARE &quot; WORKMEN &quot; WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE  ACT. 40       By Section 13 of the  Act of 1906, &quot;  &apos; workman &apos; does not include any person      &quot; employed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration exceeds two      &quot; hundred and fifty pounds a year, or a person whose employment is of a casual nature      &quot; and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employees trade or      &quot; business, or a member of  a police force, or an outworker, or a member of employer&apos;?      &quot; family dwelling in his house, but save  as  aforesaid, means any  person who has      &quot; entered into  or works under a contract  of service  or apprenticeship with  an      &quot; employer, whether by way of  manual  labour,  clerical work, or otherwise, and      &quot; whether the contract is expressed or implied, is oral or in writing.&quot;          Section 9 provides that &quot; This Act shall not apply to persons  in the naval or      &quot; military service of the Crown, but otherwise shall apply to workmen employed by      &quot; or under the Crown to whom this Act would apply if the employer were a private      &quot; person.&quot;          Section 7 applies the Act to seamen, but by sub-section (2) provides that &quot; This      &quot; Act  shall not apply to  such members  of the crew of a  fishing vessel  as  are      &quot; remunerated by shares in the profits or the gross earnings of the working of such      &quot; vessel.&quot;          The classes of persons at present excluded, whose inclusion within, the benefits of      the Act we have had to consider, are non-manual workers whose remuneration exceeds       250 a year;  casual  labour employed otherwise than for  the purposes of  the      employees business; London taxicab drivers; and share fishermen.                     Subsection 1. Non-manual Workers above  250. 41       It is mainly the clerk who is interested in the question whether;  or not the limit      of  250 should be raised.  Undoubtedly the rise in wages of recent years in which      clerical workers have participated has had  the  effect  of raising  above the  250      barrier, and so excluding from the Act, many who previously were included.  We      think we ought, so far as possible, to restore to the protection of the Act those within      its scope in, say, 1913.          We recommend the inclusion within the definition of  &quot; workman &quot; of persons      employed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration is at a  rate      not exceeding  350 a year.                            Sub-section 2. Casual Labour.42      It was suggested  that  we should delete  this exception from the definition  of      &quot; workman &quot; and so bring all forms of casual labour within the Act.   In our opinion     this Act already covers all classes of casual labour for which an employer can     reasonably be required to undertake liability, and we feel unable to  recommend the      extension of the Act in the manner suggested.   We think, however,  it would  be      advisable to amend the terms by which employment of a casual nature is excluded      from the definition of &quot; workman,&quot; so as to bring it into conformity with the similar      exclusion from the National Insurance Act, 1911, and the Unemployment Insurance      Bill now before Parliament, that is to say:               &quot; Employment of a casual nature otherwise than for the  purposes of the           &quot;  employees trade or business, and otherwise than for  the purposes of any           &quot; game or recreation where the persons employed are engaged or paid through           &quot; a club, and in such cases the club shall be deemed to be the employer&quot;                              Sub-section 3. Cab Drivers.43      Complaint  was  made before us on behalf of the London  taxi-cab drivers that      they are now excluded from the benefit of the Act.  The decisions in Ddggett v.      Waterloo Taxi-Cab  Company [1910] 2 K.B. 336, and Smith v. General Motor Cab     Company [1911], A.C. 188, upheld findings that London taxi-cab drivers were
     bailees of their cabs, and therefore were not the servants of the cab-owner and so not     &quot; workmen &quot; within the Act.         Until the above decisions  County Court Judges had held that taxi-cab drivers     were &quot; workmen,&quot; and within the Act.         The arguments against their inclusion put forward  by the  proprietors were     that they were not employers of the drivers; that the relationship is that of partners,     the driver  taking as his share a percentage of the  takings; and that no control     is exercised by the cab-owner over the work of the driver.         The question does  not appear to concern cab-owners and drivers outside the     Metropolis.  We have made enquiry as to  the practice in several of the larger cities     of Great Britain other than London,  and in each case  we have been informed that     the cab-driver is remunerated by a fixed wage, and is a &quot; workman  &quot; within the Act.         We feel that the  distinction which has been drawn between a London taxi-cab     driver and a person working under a contract of service is one of  form rather  than     substance;  and that the London driver ought  not to be deprived of benefits enjoyed     by similar workers in other places simply because his  remuneration is arrived  at by     a different  method.         We recommend an amendment of the definition of &quot; workman  &quot; so as to include     the class of cab-drivers excluded by the decisions above referred to.                            Sub-Section 4. Share Fishermen.44      By Section 7 (2) of the Act it is provided  that &quot; This Act shall  not  apply to     such members of the crew of a fishing vessel as are  remunerated by shares in the     profits,or the gross earnings of the working of such vessel &quot;.  The House of Lords     in Costello v. Kelsall Bros.  &amp; Beeching, 6 B.W.C.C. 480, decided that the words     &quot; solely &quot; or &quot; wholly &quot; or even &quot;substantially&quot; could not he read into the sub-section,     the result  being  that share fishermen are excluded  from the Act,  whether  they     are wholly or only in  part remunerated by a  share in the  profits or gross  earnings     of the vessel.         Broadly, the problem whether or not  share fishermen shall be brought within     the Act, has to be considered chiefly in relation to (a) trawler fishermen, and (b)     those engaged in the herring fishery.                               *  (a) Trawler  Fishermen.45      The crew of a  trawler are generally remunerated  partly by wages and partly     by  a share of the proceeds  of the catch,  in  proportions  that vary with  different     ratings  and.  in different ports.  Generally speaking, the  skipper and the second     hand  or mate are remunerated entirely by shares.   At certain ports some of the     rating are remunerated solely by a fixed wage, and  obtain the benefits of the Act.     The position was thus stated in evidence  by Mr. W. L. Hooper, on behalf of the     National Union of  British Fishermen :                 &quot; As regards fishermen, there are various ratings sailing on board the           &quot; ship.  The skipper and  the second  hand are paid entirely on the  share           &quot; system that is, with reference to trawling and the profits of the vessel are           &quot; divided into 14 shares; the skipper receives If of that 14, the mate receives           &quot; one, which has recently been raised to 1J; and the remainder of the  crew,           &quot; apart from the engineers, are paid a  certain  weekly wage, and so much per           &quot; cent, of the gross result of the catch; it varies in different ports.   Let me           &quot; take Grimsby.  The rate there for an ordinary deck hand is 35s. per week.           &quot; His claim is this, that he is paid a weekly wage :  he signs articles for that           &quot; weekly wage: when the fish is landed  and sold,  and the  return shown, he           &quot; is paid one per cent,  of the gross amount received. As another  example           &quot; let me take Fleetwood.  At Fleetwood they are paid on the net results of the           &quot; catch; and they  have had  a very  hard winter round  about there this           &quot; year-there is no doubt about that-and they find themselves in this position,           &quot; that the vessel has hardly made sufficient to cover expenses incurred, and the           &quot; man has almost found himself with practically only 35s.  a week.&quot;*         The claim put  forward on behalf of the  trawler fishermen is, that they should     be placed on the same footing as  workmen in other industries, that is to  say, that     they should be allowed the benefits of the Act on establishing that they are working*!Hooper, 21,821.
   &quot;wo^kmaT&apos;^^ 0f  SerViCe&apos;         0therwise within tlle definition  of the term       The case of the trawler owners was placed before us in a statement submitted on   their behalf by the British Trawler Owners&apos; Federation :-         K   &quot; They are opposed to the inclusion of share fishermen within the scope         u of tne Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, because the men are co-adventurers         I m tne  joint fishing venture, and their  position is  analogous to  that of          partners taking a share in the profits but only taking a limited share in the         &quot; expenses.....             &quot; Why should a partner in an adventure, even  if he be  a dominant         ^c partner, bear the expense of the  insurance of his co-partner or co-adven-         &quot; tnrer ?  There seems no reason why such an expense should fall upon one         &quot; co-partner or co-adventurer only and  not on the others.&quot;      In our view, the terms &quot; co-partner &quot; and &quot; co-adventurer &quot; cannot rightly he  applied to trawler fishermen.  In all material aspects the relationship  between the  trawler owner and the trawler fisherman is one of master and servant.  The payment  by share to trawler fishermen is in truth remuneration  for work done as a servant.  This is in agreement  with the  decision in Scottish Insurance Commissioners v.  M&apos;Naughton  [1914], S.C. 826, that  trawl share fishermen who were paid wages or  shares were employed under a contract of service and therefore &quot; employed persons &quot;  within the meaning of the National Insurance Act, 1911.      We feel  that the trawler fisherman&apos;s  claim to the benefits of the  Act  on the  same footing as  other  &quot;workmen &quot;is  one which  cannot  be  resisted, and  we see  no reason to suppose  that his inclusion would impose any serious new burden upon  the industry.  We are informed that although  there is no legal liability, there is a  system  of  compensation in  force at certain ports on the lines  of the Workmen&apos;s  Compensation Act, and that insurance is effected by the owners  to cover this liability  through the Mutual Marine Insurance Association.     We recommend that the Act be amended to include trawler fishermen, and that  for the  purposes  of the Act money  received from  shares should be deemed to be  part of the workman&apos;s earnings     It has  been suggested that the existing methods of computing compensation in  cases of incapacity on the basis of the individual workman&apos;s average weekly earnings  may not be found to work satisfactorily  in this industry,  where earnings are liable to  somewhat serious fluctuations.  This is a matter that should if necessary be considered and dealt with by the proposed Commissioner who would possibly be able to arrange an agreement between the employers and  the workmen.  If this proves impracticable, any difficulty that arises must be dealt with by legislation at a later date when experience has indicated a reasonable remedy.                            (b)  The Herring Fishery.     The  herring fishing industry has from  its earliest days been conducted on the profit-sharing system.   Mr. Fenner, Chairman of the National Herring  Fisheries Protection Association,  in his  evidence before us,  thus  described the practice on the East Coast.     After each voyage the boats are &quot; made up,&quot; that is to say, a settling sheet is prepared, showing the gross earnings of the voyage, deductions against such gross earnings, and the division of the net earnings.   From the gross earnings there are usually  deducted  the expenses of commissions, harbour dues, labour^ food, stores, carting, salt, ice, water, coal, oil,   2 for small boat, and   10 for spoilt nets^  The net earnings thus ascertained are divided into 16 shares,  which  are equally divided between the owner of  the boat and the crew.   The crew&apos;s  shares are again sub- divided  into 87 to 91 shares.  Of these sub-divided  shares,  the owner  takes  10 in respect of the capstan, and the remaining shares are roughly divided as follows.  The master gets  14 shares,  the mate 9, the engineer  10, and  the  other members of the crew other proportions  of shares according to rank.    The herring fishermen are accordingly distinguished from the trawler fishermenby the fact that the former are remunerated wholly by shares. Furthermore; in thecase at any rate of certain ports in Scotland, the fishermen are under an obligationto share  losses, and it has accordingly been decided that they are not employed                                                                          o  29358
      under a  contract of service.  (Scottish Insurance Commissioners v. WNaughton      [1-914]^ S.C. 826.)  No application from the herring  fishermen was received by us      for their  inclusion in the Act.          Mr. Tenner, speaking on behalf of the owners at ports on the East Coast, stated      that while not regarding  herring fishermen as working under a contract of service,      they would not object to  their inclusion within  the Act, provided that the benefits      were limited to those prescribed  in the existing Act,  and that the  fishermen      contributed towards the cost of insurance.          On  the evidence before us we  are  unable to  recommend  the inclusion  of      herring fishermen under the Act, but we recommend that the proposed Commissioner      be empowered,  if satisfied  after public enquiry that these or any other class  of      fishermen ought to be treated as workmen under the Act, to make an Order applying      the Act subject to any modifications that may appear necessary or desirable.  Any      such Order  should require to be laid  before both Houses of Parliament, and if      either House within a specified period resolved that the Order ought to be annulled,      the Order should be of no effect.                                  SECTION 2. SEAMEN. 47       The  Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act does not apply to accidents happening on a      British ship on the high seas, save in the cases specially provided for in Section 7.      The persons brought within the scope of  the Act by that section are &quot; masters,      seamen and apprentices to the sea service, and apprentices to the sea-fishing service,&quot;      provided they are &quot; workmen &quot; within the meaning of the Act, and provided further      that they  are &quot; members of the crew of any ship registered in the United Kingdom,      or of any  other British ship or vessel of which the owner or  ...   .  the manag-      ing owner, or manager resides or has  his principal place of business in the United      Kingdom.&quot;          To) meet the peculiar circumstances of seamen, special provisions are  included      in the section as to service  of notice of accident  and  claim; as to  the time within      which proceedings may be commenced; and as to evidence.   The scale and conditions      of compensation are also modified in view of the  fact  that the Merchant Shipping      Act provides for the seaman in case of illness or injury during the voyage and until      he is returned to the United Kingdom.          The scheme by which seamen have been brought within the Act appears on the      whole to have worked successfully.  It  has, however,  been suggested to us  that in      one or two directions the Act can properly be extended and its operation made more      effective.                                                              &apos;   &apos;1!T&quot;-^48       First, as to persons within Section 7.   Representations have been made to the      Home Office from time  to time that all persons  employed on British ships should      be within the protection of the Act, and not merely those in the above-mentioned      category.   Cases specially  mentioned were certain bandsmen who went down in      the  &quot;Titanic&quot;;  persons employed in the post office  on board ship; and barbers      in the service of a contractor with the shipowners.  The claim has also been made      that not only persons employed on board British ships, but also workmen travelling      on ships outside the territorial limits  of the United Kingdom  for  the purposes of      their employment should be brought within  the protection of the Act.          We can see no valid reason why  the Act should not be applied to all persons      ordinarily resident in  this country, who are employed, or are travelling in the course      of their employment, on board a British ship, and we recommend accordingly.49       We were urged to  remove an alleg-ed hardship  by  which  British  seamen     signing on in colonial-owned or foreign-owned ships are unable to claim compensa-      tion in this country wThen there is no  managing owner here.  With regard to this      question Mr.  Michael Brett,  Secretary of  the   Shipping Federation,  stated  as      follows:                &quot; Normally, the  crews of  all steamers registered in the Colonies are           &quot; engaged in the Colonies to which they belong.   A very small proportion of           &quot; the whole of these vessels, which are principally Australian and Canadian           &quot; owned, trade  to this country,  and  it rarelv happens that a man has to be           &quot; landed here sufferinp;  from an injury.   If this should happen and the          - &quot; principal place  of business of the  owners is not in this country, it is true           &quot; that he would have no claim under the English  Workmen&apos;s Compensation           &quot; Act.   He would in that case be in  the same position as a. seaman belonging           &quot; to a vessel registered in the United Kingdom  who was discharged  injured           &quot; in Australia,  that is  to say,  he could not enforce a claim until  he was
       &quot; repatriated to the country  to which his vessel belongs,  and on  arrival       &quot; there he could enforce his claim under the local laws, for I believe in all       &quot; the principal Colonies there is  a Workmen&apos;s  Compensation Act closely       II corresponding with the English Act.  Our men cannot claim abroad,  and       &quot; the foreign man cannot claim here, but our man has a claim in his own       &quot; country. &quot;*     It does not appear to us that it would be practicable or desirable, save in pursu- ance of  international agreement, to make any legal provision to enable a British seaman on a ship registered out of  the United Kingdom  to recover compensation in this country.  British seamen engaging on ships registered out of the United King- dom must be content to rely on the Workmen^ Compensation Law of the country of registration.    ; At the same time, it is desirable that seamen  should clearly understand their position in  regard to workmen&apos;s compensation should they so  engage, and we hope the Board of Trade will find  it possible to warn seamen as to the risk involved in engaging on such ships.     Mr^ James Henson in his evidence  on behalf of  the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union referred to special difficulties in the way of proof of accident, and suggested:            &quot; That all accidents, however slight, should be entered in the official log-       &quot; book kept on board ship, and that that log-book should be proof  that an       &quot; accident had happened.&quot;!     It  is already compulsory upon  the master  of a  ship, under Section  240 of the Merchant  Shipping Act, 1894, to  enter in the log every  case of illness or injury happening to a  member  of the crew, with  the  nature thereof, and  the medical treatment adopted,  and the workman can always secure the production of the log-book at the trial in any disputed claim if he takes proper steps to  do so.  In our view it is not necessary to  supplement the existing law upon  this subject.     By Section 7 (1) (c) of the Act it is provided that &quot; where an injured master, &quot; seaman or. apprentice is discharged or left behind in a  British possession or in a &quot; foreign country, depositions respecting the circumstances and nature of the injury &quot; may be taken by any judge  or magistrate in the  British possession,  and by any &quot; British consular officer in the foreign country  ....  and such depositions &quot;.   .  .   .   shall   .  .   .   .  be admissible in  evidence&quot; in proceedings for  en- forcing a claim under the Act.  We understand  that in fact  such  depositions.are very seldom  taken in ordinary cases of injury  not resulting in death probably because the master is unwilling to delay his ship long enough  to enable the Consulto take the depositions required.    It appears to  us that greater use ought to be made  of this provision,  and we recommend that the Consuls should in every case where it is possible to do so takedepositions from the master and any other person who can give evidence as to  thecause of the injury.    The following further difficult question was raised by Mr.  Henson :-          &quot; A seaman may be ready to sign on a vessel  from any port;  he passes      &quot; the doctor before he leaves;  he makes provision for his wife and dependants      &quot; before he goes away by the allotment of so much per week during his absence;      &quot; and I have known cases where the man has gone away and left his home in      &quot; perfect condition; left his wife a reasonable sum to keep her in good standing      &quot; till he returns; and after the vessel has been away about a month he has met      &quot; with an accident on board.   No doctor is carried in most cases, except with      &quot; passenger liners; the man is put ashore at the first port of call, and is put      &quot; into hospital; he may remain in hospital there for three months, but im-      &quot; mediately he is put on shore a cablegram is sent home to stop the allotment,      &quot; and, consequently there is no more money going into that man&apos;s home, and      &quot; he is not entitledto compensation until 14 days after his  arrival back again      &quot; in the United Kingdom.  I have known cases where the man has come home      &quot; and has not had a bed to lie upon on his return after leaving it in  good con-      &quot; dition.  On that point we consider that full wages should be paid until  his      &quot; return, or, at least, that the allotment should be paid  in full to make sure      &quot; that his dependants are all  right.   Cases of that character can be obtained      &quot; from the Board of Guardians, who supply relief in such cases, which relief,      &quot; of course, is not sufficient.&quot;!         * Brett 23,194.         f Henson, 2457.  .       \ Henson, 2384.29858                                                                   0 2
     This complaint was dealt with by the Secretary to the Shipping Federation inthe following words :            &quot; A great number of sailors have no dependants.  If a seaman has a family       &quot;  the practice is for him to leave what is called  an allotment note, and under       &quot;  that note the  person in whose favour it is given is entitled to draw from the       &quot;  owner monthly a certain proportion of the man&apos;s wages, provided he is still       &quot;  on board and earning wages; and so long as the man&apos;s contract is in existence&apos;       &quot;  those allotment notes are paid regularly; the allottee has a legal right to       &quot;  enforce payment; but when  the contract terminates the allotment note  ter-       &quot;  minates  with it.  ....  As  soon as  the  man  is  discharged  for       &quot;  any reason whatever,  accident,  illness,  desertion,  or  whatever it  is,       &quot;  the right to  sue under the allotment  note comes to  an  end.....       &quot;  With regard  to men  who are paid off injured abroad, it is true that upon       &quot;  this occurrence the contract of  employment is terminated, and no further       &quot;  wages accrue.  The  result is that allotment notes are stopped.   On  the       &quot;  other hand, it is to be remembered that a seaman&apos;s wages are not paid week       &quot;  by week, but  subject to  payments under allotment notes or advance notes,       &quot;  they accumulate during the voyage, so that  in practically every case in       &quot;  which a man is paid off injured abroad the Master will pay to him, or, if       &quot;  in a foreign  port, to the  Consul,  the accumulation of his wages  earned       &quot;  during the voyage, which will be at his disposal.  Moreover, under  the       &quot;  Merchant Shipping Act the shipowner is liable for his maintenance, medical       &quot;  and surgical expenses during his residence  abroad, and for the whole cost       &quot;  of his repatriation to this country when he is sufficiently recovered  to travel.       &quot;  In  many cases this amounts to a very serious liability, and to  a heavier       &quot;  charge than would fall upon the shipowner if  the man were landed injured       &quot;  in this country and he became liable only to pay half wages under the Work-       &quot;  men&apos;s Compensation  Act.  It should also be remembered that  in theTatter       &quot;  event, although the owner has to pay an allowance equal to half the wages       &quot;  (subject to a maximum) he is not liable for maintenance, medical, or surgical       &quot;  expenses, which  the man has to pay from his allowance.  It  is  doubtful,       &quot;  therefore, whether the man is any worse off when he is discharged abroad.&quot;*     After consideration, we are  of opinion that no  liability under the Workmen&apos;compensation Act ought to be superimposed  upon the shipowner^ liability underthe Merchant Shipping Act so as to make the two liabilities a heavier  burden thanthat carried by other employers.  On the other hand, should our recommendations forincreased benefits be adopted,  it is probable that the  shipowner^ liability under theMerchant Shipping Act will  often be less than the compensation which  would be payable under the Workmen&apos;s  Compensation Act.     We  recommend that  the  existing  law should be  amended  to provide that infuture the liability under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of the owner to theseaman shall commence at the  expiration of three days from the date of the accident,as proposed in the case of other workmen, and that the owner should be entitled tocredit for all money actually and reasonably expended by him under the terms of theMerchant Shipping Act for the maintenance of and the hospital treatment  of and medical attendance upon the seaman  from the date of his injury until his arrival ata port in the United Kingdom, accounting: to the workman or his dependants for thedifference, if any, between this sum and the sum due under the Workmen&apos;s Compen-sation Act.                 SECTION 3. &quot; DEPENDANTS &quot; WITHIN THE ACT.     The  present law  confines the  term &quot; dependant &quot; to  certain members  of the workman&apos;s family.  What constitutes dependency in such  a member of the  familyis discussed under the section dealing with &quot; Benefits &quot; in fatal cases.     It was  represented before us that dependency in fact,  and not dependencycoupled with relationship, should be the  criterion of responsibility, and that weshould apply the definition contained in the Pensions Warrant, viz., &quot;Dependantmeans any person  .  .   .  who  is found as a fact to have been wholly or in partdependent upon a soldier &quot; (Art. 24  (5)).     This would involve a far-reaching extension of the Act, for which no sufficientreasons were advanced, and we do not recommend it.* Brett, 23,161-2 ; 23,156.
                                       PART V.                                      BENEFITS.                               SECTION 1.-COMPENSATION.54       The subject  now before us is the  most  important part of the Act  and has     occupied our time and attention over a lengthened period.          It is broadly divided into  two parts-            (i) benefits accruing to dependants in fatal cases,           (ii) compensation payable to an injured workman during incapacity.          Hitherto the principle acted  upon  in assessing the  amount  payable by the     employer in either event has been that  it is  to be  calculated on the basis of the     workman&apos;s  earnings, and we have  been  much concerned whether it is advisable to     maintain this principle in the  future.   We hereinafter deal with  the question in     detail under the different headings.                               Sub-section 1 Fatal Cases.55      Judge Sir Edward Bray, in placing  before us the collective views of the County     Court Judges, stated with reference to the last-mentioned point as follows :-         &quot; A  considerable number of Judges are  in favour of abolishing this method     &quot; of assessment, mainly or partly on the ground that it gives rise to difficulties which     &quot; can only be solved by litigation.  I may refer by way of illustration to a recent case     &quot; of Price v. Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Ltd. (1918), 11 B.W.C.C. 154,  where the     &quot; question whether the widow was entitled to  260 or  300 depended on whether in     &quot; a particular week of the previous year  the deceased workman was  to be  deemed to     &quot; have been in the respondent&apos;s employment.  That case went to the House of Lords     &quot; and was the subject of great difference of opinion.   Why in the name of  common       sense should the amount of the widow&apos;s compensation depend upon such  a  point as     &quot; this ?  Is it not desirable to make some attempt at least to frame some scheme which     &quot; will no longer make the  amount of compensation dependent  on  the solution  of     &quot;  questions which should not really  affect the amount of compensation at  all? &quot;*         Judge Lock expressed the  view that &quot; the average earnings of the individual     &quot;  is not  a satisfactory basis to  go upon, and is often extremely unjust.  I give one     &quot; illustration.   Take the case of a hard-working invalid man, working his best, able     &quot; to work only half time, but at the same time an excellent father bringing up his     &quot; children well,  and contrast him with a strong man able to work full time and over-     &quot;  time, but a bad father  giving only a third of his income, which is not uncommon,     &quot;  I am sorry to say, in my district, to his family, and spending the rest in horseracing,     &quot;  betting, and that sort of thing. During the  men&apos;s  lives their families are getting     &quot;  just about  the same, notwithstanding the fact that one is earning three times  as     &quot;  much as the other, because the second man gives only a third of his income to his     &quot;  family  ....   The family of the  better man will have a maintenance about     &quot;  equal to the family of  the less worthy man,  but after their deaths the bad man&apos;s     &quot;  family may have three times as much as the  good man&apos;s.1&apos;t        And when presenting the considered views of the Association of County Court     Registrars, Mr. Lowe said, &quot; In our view the amount payable should not depend upon     &quot; the man&apos;s earnings because, theoretically, the better paid workman should be  in a     &quot;  better position to make some provision for his dependants than the labourer.&quot;!         We are unanimously of opinion  that the pressing  need at the present time is that     adequate  provision should  be  made to  secure that  the  children of  a  fatally     injured workman should have a reasonable chance of developing into healthy  and     intelligent members of the community and that within proper limits all interests     should be subordinated to the attainment of this  object.   With this end in view it will    be necessary, for reasons hereinafter mentioned,  to  adopt the  principle of fixed    benefits for&apos; the  different classes of  dependants without reference to  the earnings     of the deceased  workman.        The death of a workman as the result of  an accident may give rise to  a claim    for compensation in respect of  (a) total dependants,  (b) partial dependants,  or,     (c) burial  and medical expenses in cases where there are no dependants.                * Bray, 15,001.           t Lock. 6369-70.           t Lowe* 9208.       29358                                                                  0 3
                                (a) Total Dependants.         The existing scale of compensation has remained unchanged  since the first56  Workmen^ Compensation Act.  In cases where the deceased workman leaves total     dependants, it is a lump sum payment calculated as follows :            (i) If the workman was with the same employer during the preceding three                 years:         A sum equal to his aggregate earnings during the preceding three  years,  but     not less than  150 nor more than  300, deducting any weekly payments already made     under the Act, or any lump sum paid in redemption thereof.           (ii)  If the workman was with the employer for a less period than three years :         A sum equal to his average weekly earnings during his actual employment with     the same employer, multiplied by 156, but  not less than  150 or more than  300,     deducting any weekly payments already made under the Act, or any lump sum paid     in  redemption thereof.         In the case of a  lump sum payable in a fatal case the money is to be paid into     the County Court (unless the workman leaves no dependants), there to be &quot; invested,     applied, or otherwise dealt with &quot; for the benefit of the dependants (Schedule I (5)).     In practice the amount is generally paid out to the dependants in instalments until     exhausted, that is to say for a  limited period of years.  &quot; In the case of a widow     &quot; and young family, the  lump sum  is as  a rule invested, and monthly payments     &quot; are made to the mother varying from time to time, according to the circumstances.     &quot; It is true the fund is frequently exhausted long before the family have ceased to     &quot; need help.&quot;*         The scale of compensation to total dependants accordingly does no more than     provide a  sum which would tide a family over  a few years in order  to enable     them to accommodate themselves to altered conditions due to the breadwinners death.         A method of computing compensation which has no regard to the age, condition,     needs or even numbers of the surviving dependants, results in anomalies, and works     unfairly in the case of families.  A young widow with no child and well  able to   -  support herself may  be awarded the same amount of compensation as a widow with     a number  of young children.    In  a large number  of cases  the former quickly     re-marries, while the latter  is involved in a constant  struggle to maintain  herself     and her family.  One of the largest colliery companies in the country supplied us     with the following particulars of the dependants left in their last ten fatal accidents.Table showing number of dependants and the amount of compensation paid.

A system which gives the same amount of compensation to an elderly widowwithout family and to the widow left with six  young children is clearly in need ofreconsideration,, and no suggestion throughout  our enquiry received a body of sup-port so strong and so nearly unanimous as  the suggestion that in computing com-pensation, regard should be had to the number and condition of the dependants leftby the deceased workman.    The remedy wdiich at once suggests itself is that in each case of total dependencythe amount of compensation should be the estimated pecuniary loss of the dependantswithin fixed maximum and minimum limits.  A considerable number of the County* Bray, 15,011.
Court Judges favoured this solution of the problem.*  We were, however, impressed by the objection that this method of determining the amount of compensation would leave the question so much at large as to necessitate recourse to arbitration in almost every case, and would not secure a certainty of adequate provision for the children.    A large  number of witnesses  were in  favour of providing a pension for the widow until death or re-marriage, and an allowance for each child until self-support-ing.   It soon became clear, however, that the cost of providing for  the widow aswell as the children on a pension basis would be prohibitive.  In our view, therefore,compensation to the widow must continue to take the form of a lump sum.    In the case of children, we are of opinion, for reasons hereinafter detailed, thatthere is no difficulty in arranging for a weekly payment to all young children of afatally injured wrorkman, which is admittedly the most advantageous course to adopt.    We have, accordingly, come to the conclusion that when the total dependantsinclude a widow  and children, the widow&apos;s compensation should be awarded  sepa-rately from the children&apos;s compensation, that the widow&apos;s compensation should be a lump sum,  but that compensation to children under the age of  15  should take  theform of individual weekly allowances.    We have next to decide what amount should be payable under these heads.  Wehave anxiously considered the subject from all points of view, having at all  timeskept before us the fact that an industry should provide a fair, but not extravagant,sum in the case of fatal accident,  and that when there  are young  children specialeffort  should  be made  to provide for their welfare out of the amount which  theindustry can reasonably be called upon to contribute.    We propose that the lump sum to be awarded to the widow of a deceased work-man, whether or not there are children, should be   250 in  all  cases  of total depend-ency.   Our object in fixing a flat rate is to attain simplicity and avoid litigation; wewrere also influenced by the views expressed  by a number of witnesses that the livingexpenses of a workman&apos;s widow would be, generally speaking, the same, whateverwere the deceased husband&apos;s earnings.    What provision should be made for the  young children  is  a difficult problem.In view of the great decline in the purchasing value of  money it is evident that where there is only a single child  to provide for, the weekly  allowance, continuinguntil  the child reaches the  age of 15, should not be less than  10s. a week.   Wherethe family comprises more than one child a smaller average sum may be  held tobe reasonable and in this  connection we  are bound to have regard to the heavy capital liability which all such payments must entail.   We recommend, therefore,that the allowance be 10s. a week  for one child, and where there is more than one,10s. a week for the first, 7s. Qd. a vveek for the second, and 6s. a week for every otherchild; such allowance to continue in all cases until  the child  reaches  the age of 15.These rates are the same as those provided under the Royal Warrant for the children of widows in receipt of war pensions.  In  fixing  the age of 15 years instead of 16,we had in  our minds the fact that for some years to come the majority of childrenover 14 years will be earning money and will consequently not be total dependantswithin the Act.   For the sake of simplicity, therefore, we have taken the age  at 15,and recommend that all children under the age of 15 years should be deemed to betotally  dependent whether or not they were in  fact wholly dependent upon  the earnings of the deceased.  We were also  influenced by the fact that, by excludingthose over  15 years of age, we are enabled to increase the weekly  payments to the younger children.    We have next to consider the financial arrangements by which these allowances should be supported.   They represent a liability which at the one extreme may be atrivial sum, but at the other may far exceed   1,000. It is obviously undesirable to im-pose upon uninsured employers a liability which is so uncertain both as to its amount and the duration  over which its discharge must extend.   To leave the matter withoutfurther provision might even work  social harm by prejudicing  the employmentof men with large families.   As  regards the insured employer  the matter isscarcely less  difficult.   The risk  is one which the Insurance Companies with a largepremium  income could safely take but from which the Companies with a limitedpremium income may reasonably shrink; and even the largest Companies may hesitate to accept  a  form of liability imposing upon them the administrative burden of payment of weekly sums extending, in the limit, to 15 years and requiring themconstantly to review the ages of the children and to  adjust the payments as thebeneficiaries  successively reach the age of  15.  For these reasons  we have arrived29358* Bray, 15,030.
 at the conclusion that the liability in respect of children must be dealt with through a central fund, to which a capital payment of uniform amount should be paid in respect of each death  where a family is left, regardless of the number of children in the family.   We have here to face such difficulty as arises from inequalities,  as to the average size of families, between different industries.  To give effect  to this factor would require  the grading of the capital payment with reference to  industry, and would introduce complications which if possible should  be avoided.   We  think  it better, therefore, to propose a &quot; flat &quot; payment into the fund regardless of the slight advantage which some industries will probably secure at the expense of others.     We are advised by the Government Actuary that so far as the liability can be measured  by  the  data at  present  available,  it represents,  on  a  5  per cent. basis, a capital sum of  500 payable on the death of the father.   We realise that at the present moment it is possible to invest a fund made up of sums such as this to produce substantially more  than 5  per  cent,,  but provision  must  be  made  for expenses  of administration,  and we  suggest the possibility that interest  received in excess of 5 per cent, may  be deemed, for  the present, sufficient for this purpose. We recommend accordingly  that such a fund  be established under Government control, the investments being made in the usual course by the National Debt Com- missioners.     We do not think the Exchequer can be expected to guarantee  the  solvency of the fund, and,  in view of the present imcompleteness of the data required  to measure the liability,  we recognise  the possibility that  experience may show the need  for  future revision, either upwards or downwards,  of the  capital sum  of  500 which we propose should be payable in respect of each family for  the first three years.  We think  that any such revision, having effect both as to the past and  as to the future, should be made in connection with the triennial  adjustment of the premiums, with such corresponding provision as may be suitable in the case  of &quot; self-insurers.&quot;  The charge to be made upon the fund for expenses of administra- tion and the extent to which the capital sums should be revised, or the finance  of the fund otherwise adjusted, at the triennial intervals, are matters  for Treasury Regulations.    The proposed  Commissioner  should undertake the distribution of the weekly payments due &apos;in respect of children  through the County Court Registrars.  When the dependants move from one district to another the duty of distribution should be transferred to the Registrar of the new district.  In rural areas the Post Office might be utilised in the same way as is proposed for the purpose of Unemployment Insurance to distribute the sums due, and to get the necessary  certificates for  their  receipt. We considered  the desirability of including in the central  fund amounts payable  to widows and dependants other than children.   We have come to the  conclusion that such amounts should be administered as at present.    The result of the foregoing recommendations will be that if the only dependant is a widow, the compensation  payable will  be  250.  If the dependants are a widowand a child or children under 15 years the compensation payable will be   750, namely 250 to the widow and  500  in respect of such child or children.   Should the onlydependant or dependants be a child or children under 15 the compensation  payablewill be  500 only.    Where there is no widow or children under 15, but there are other total depen-dants, parents,  for example, we think they should be put on the same footing as the widow and awarded a fixed sum of  250.    There remains the case where the dependants include a widow with or without children and also other total dependants, parents for example. We  suggest that  insuch cases the arbitrator should have power to award, in addition to the lump sumdue to the widow  and any lump sum due in respect of children under 15 years, a further sum  not exceeding  50, but subject to that limit determined according to the needs of the case.    The maximum liability for compensation in  respect of a workman&apos;s death will accordingly be  800.    Our recommendations in regard  to the  basis, nature  and amount of  compen- sation to total  dependants in fatal cases may be summarised thus;    In respect  of a widow there is to be paid a sum of  250.    In respect  of  a child or children under 15  whatever the number, there is  to be paid a sum of  500, to be pooled and invested as hereinbefore mentioned in order to provide weekly allowances.    In respect  of any dependants other than and in the absence of a widow (totally or partially dependent) or children under 15,  there is to be paid a  sum of  250.
* Lowe, 9212.         In respect of any dependants other than but together with a widow or children,     there  is to be paid, in addition to the suras payable in respect of the widow and     children, such further sum not exceeding  50 as the arbitrator may in his discretion     award.61      We have considered whether the existing provisions requiring the deduction of     all sums to be paid to a fatally injured workman before his death  should be altered.     We are informed that the sum involved is comparatively  small, amounting on the     average to no more than   6 or  7  per case.   In the circumstances, and bearing     in mind our anxiety to make ample provision for the children, we are of opinion that     it will be advisable to amend the existing provisions so as to provide that the afore-     mentioned benefits  should  be  payable  without deduction,  and we recommend     accordingly.                                 (b) Partial Dependants.62      The compensation payable where there are only partial  dependants is such a sum     as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury sustained by the dependants by the     workman&apos;s death, but not more than the amount which would be payable if the appli-     cant were a total dependant.  The test is not whether  there was actual dependency   .  upon the deceased for support, but whether or not financial injury  resulted from the     workman&apos;s death.  Such a question as whether the  applicant can support himself     according to the standard  of his class without the assistance of the earnings of the     deceased workman is held  to be irrelevant.  As a consequence &quot; Payments are con-     &quot; stantly being made to fathers to compensate them for the  death of sons who, in the     &quot; majority of such cases, are merely lodgers in the home, contributing  for their sup-     &quot; port something less than the market price they would have to pay for such accom-     t! modation elsewhere, and liable at any moment to sever  their connection with it     &quot; either by death, marriage or  change of locality.&quot;*  It is difficult to justify the     payment of compensation  to  persons  under this heading  who are not in fact de-     pendent for maintenance on the  earnings of  the deceased workman.         With this conclusion before us, it becomes necessary to  consider the definition of     &quot; partial dependant.&quot;  A  form  of words declaring what partial dependency is not,     does little  to help to solve the problem, which is to  find a positive definition of partial     dependency.  An attempt at a  solution was made by Mr. Lowe  on  behalf of the     Association of County Court Registrars in the suggestion that &quot;  no  one should be     &quot; considered a partial  dependant, except the widowed mother or sister  to whom     &quot; the man is the main source of support.&quot;.*         Some of the American Statutes,  e.g., that of Massachusetts, use the expression     &quot; partly dependent upon his earnings for support.&quot;  In a  State where this form of     words was used  it has been held that &quot; the test  of dependency  is not whether the     &quot; petitioner, by reducing his expenses below a standard suitable to his condition of     &quot; life, could secure a subsistence for his family without  the contributions of the     &quot; deceased son,  but whether such contributions were needed to provide, the family     &quot; with the ordinary necessaries  of life suitable for persons in their class and  posi-     &quot; tion.&quot;   (Dozy v. Apponaug Co., 36 R.I. 81, 85,  89A, 160.)       To arrive at the real contribution of the deceased workman to the family fund in     which the  alleged partial dependants participate has always been a difficult problem     for arbitrators.  We think the test of partial dependency which is easiest of applica-     tion is that applied in the American case of Dazy v. Apponaug Co., quoted above.         We recommend that the compensation to be paid to partial dependants should be     such a sum representing the value of the deceased workman&apos;s contributions to the     support of the partial dependants (the term &quot; support &quot; being taken to mean the     provision of the  ordinary necessaries of life suitable for persons in their class and     position) as shall be agreed between the parties or, in default of agreement, shall be     deemed fair and reasonable by the arbitrator, subject  to a maximum which in our     view should be fixed at  250.  We further recommend that where total dependants     are left, no compensation shall be payable to  a partial dependant other than a widow.                         (c) Burial  and Medical Expenses.oq      Where there are no dependants,  a sum not  exceeding  10 is now payable in     respect of the reasonable expenses of the deceased workman&apos;s medical attendance     and burial.         We recommend that where  the deceased, workman leaves no  dependants  there     shall be paid the reasonable expenses of his medical attendance and burial not     exceeding   15.
                           Sub-section 2. Cases of Incapacity.64      Different  rules apply to the, payment  of  weekly compensation for incapacity     according as  the  incapacity is total or partial, and minors are the  subject of     special provisions.                                  (a) Total Incapacity.65      During total incapacity the weekly payment is  a sum not exceeding one-half     of the average weekly earnings during the preceding twelve months or any  less     period with the same employer with a maximum of  1.         As  an alternative to  the method  by which  the  basis of  weekly  compensation     is average weekly earnings it was urged upon us by an influential body of witnesses     that compensation should vary  according  to  the workman&apos;s needs,  for example,     according as he is married or single,  and if married, according to the number of     his  dependent children.  In other words, the  governing  principle  should  be  the     needs of the family rather than compensation for loss of wages.   By way of illustra-     tion the two cases were put to us of a  weakly man with wife and two children able     to earn only  la week, and a young bachelor earning  3 a week.   In the event of     total incapacity, the former gets 10s. a week compensation, the latter  1.         There are  many objections  to the adoption of such  a scheme, of which  the     following can be mentioned (a) If wages do  not vary  with  the number of the work-     man^ dependants neither should compensation; (b) A workman&apos;s domestic responsi-     bilities are no concern of his employer and it would not be to the advantage of     the  average  workman that  they should become  so;  (c)  If in every  case enquiry     had to be made into a workman&apos;s domestic circumstances there would necessarily     be delay and in many cases prolonged delay before payment of compensation.  We     are, therefore, unable to recommend any change  in the  present system in this respect.66      We now come  to the question of what percentage of earnings  is to be given as     compensation and what should be the maximum limit.         It has been pressed  upon  us on  behalf of  employers that the basis  of  the     existing Act is that the employer and  the. workman should share the loss resulting     from an accident in equal proportions.  If such be the case it appears to us that     the workman gets the worst part of the bargain, inasmuch as he, has to bear the pain     and suffering and often has to  incur  expense in providing medicine and surgical     necessaries and extra food and nourishment  to make himself fit for further work.         Moreover,  the  representatives of the workmen urged before us the fact  that a     workman5s need is  greatest during illness, and that for his sake and for the  benefit     of his family, and,  indeed, ultimately for the good of the State his  income at such a     time should be  increased rather than diminished.         It is now a universally recognised  principle that a man injured in trade  should     be a charge upon the industry. Another fact is also now generally admitted, namely,     that the more quickly and effectually an injured man  is cured the better for  the in-     dustry and the  State.         In our view, therefore, the problem is mainly  a financial one.         We  have been  impressed from the evidence with  the small extent to  which  the     provision for workmen&apos;s compensation  benefits increases the price of the product to     the consumer.   As an instance, in the case of coal,  which is one of the most expensive     risks so far as workmen&apos;s compensation is concerned, the cost to-day amounts on an     average to less  than 2d. for every ton of coal dealt with, and we believe that  we  are     correct in stating that in the majority of industries the charge to the consumer in     consequence of the existing provisions for workmen&apos;s compensation  is only a fraction     of one penny in the   on any article purchased.         Many suggestions for increasing the existing  50 per cent, were made to us vary-     ing from a proposal to allow  66f per cent, of earnings  as compensation to a proposal     for full wages  during total incapacity.  The majority of the witnesses who repre-     sented the employers argued, that 50 per cent, was  a fair proportion to allow, though     several employers who gave evidence before us were in favour of an increased allow-     ance.         An element to  be considered is whether  an increase in the percentage will lead     to malingering.  We devoted attention to this question, and made careful enquiries     of employers  and  Insurance Companies officials,  and we are satisfied,  that  the     average workman is anxious to return to his work as soon as he is able, and is  not
    p  disposed to malinger.   It is interesting to recall that the Departmental Committee      on Accidents  in places under  the Factory and Workshop  Acts, who reported in      1911, arrived  at the same conclusion.*   It is our opinion that a reasonable increase      in the percentage is not likely to lead to further malingering to any material extent.          We realise that the question we are now discussing has been and will continue      to be  the  subject of considerable  controversy,  but we  have  arrived  at  the      conclusion that the percentage of earnings to be given as  compensation should      be increased.  So  far  no  State has fixed a higher  scale than 66f per cent, of the      average earnings.   That  is the maximum for total disability under  the German      Accident  Insurance Code.  In Canada  the  usual  percentage is 55 per  cent.   In      America the percentage ranges from 50 per cent,  to 66j per cent., but the latter      figure  is, we understand, being adopted in a steadily increasing number of States.      It should, however, be  observed that in several States in America the payments for      total incapacity are limited to a specified number of weeks ranging from 260 to 780.         We think that for total incapacity there should be paid weekly compensation      equal to 66f per cent, of the  injured workman&apos;s average weekly earnings.         To determine what maximum should be imposed it  is necessary to compare      existing rates  of wages with those on which the   1  maximum of the  1897  and 1906      Acts was founded.   It appears that when this maximum was fixed, the average wage      of the well-paid skilled workman at that time was  approximately   2.   We  are      satisfied from  the evidence before us that if 40s. was the full time weekly wage of a      well-paid workman in 1906, that figure is represented by at least 90s.  a week to-day.      Allowing for the suggested increased percentage, this induces us to propose 60s. as      the new maximum  for weekly compensation in respect of total incapacity.         We, therefore, recommend  that for total incapacity the system  should be con-     tinued by  which weekly compensation  is based on the injured workman&apos;s average     weekly earnings; and that there should be paid for such weekly compensation a sum     equal  to two-thirds of the  injured workman&apos;s average weekly earnings, such weekly     payment not to exceed 60s.         In making the foregoing proposals  for increased  benefits in case of death or     incapacity, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not proposing to add     seriously to the burden on industry.  Indeed, in the case of Insurance Companies,     we are assured that, taking into account the effect of the proposed working arrange-     ment with the  Companies,  the present rates of premium  will not be increased for the     first three years beyond 20 per cent.67                               (b) Partial Incapacity.         The settlement of  a satisfactory basis of compensation  for partial incapacity     remains, as it has always been, a difficult problem.   The 1897 Act gave the arbitrator     no more satisfactory guidance than the rule that &quot; in  fixing the amount of the weekly     &quot; payment, regard  shall be had to the difference between the amount of the average     &quot; weekly earnings of the workman before the accident and the average  amount which     &quot; he is able to  earn after the accident.&quot;  The 1906 Act, in the attempt to arrive at     greater precision, prescribed the rule that &quot; in the  case of partial incapacity the     &quot; weekly payment shall in no case exceed the difference between the amount of the     &quot; average weekly earnings of the workman before  the accident and the average     &quot; weekly amount which he  is  earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment     &quot; or business after  the  accident, but shall  bear such  relation to the amount of that     &quot; difference as  under the circumstances of  the case may appear proper.&quot;         The effect  of the current provision is  to allow as compensation during partial     incapacity a sum  not  exceeding the  lowest of three  maxima, namely,  (i) one-     half average weekly earnings; (ii,) the sum of  1; (in) the difference  between     pre-accident  earnings and  the amount which the workman is earning or is able to     earn in some suitable employment after the accident. It will be seen that hitherto     the basis of compensation for partial disability has  been a proportion of the wage     loss resulting from the disability.   This is known as the &quot; percentage &quot; method.  Its     advocates claim that it is  the fairest method, of assessing compensation inasmuch     as it enables wage loss to be revised according as it develops or decreases as time goes     on.  Increasing attention is, however, being given in other countries where there is a     Workmen&apos;s  Compensation  Law  to the  &quot; schedule &quot; method of compensation for     partial  disability.   By this method, a schedule of specific injuries is  compiled, and        * See last paragraph on page  17  of Report of the Departmental Committee on Accidents in places    under the Factory and Workshops Acts [1911] (Cmd. 5535).   .
     the evaluation of the loss of particular members of the body is shown as a fixed per-     centage of total disability.  To take  an illustration from a schedule based on the     collective experience of a number of German Insurance Associations, in the case of     an  unskilled workman, the degree of  disability expressed in  percentages  of total     disability is for the loss of the right arm, 60; right index linger,  15; leg, 60; great     toe,  10;  one  eye, 25.  The great advantage of the &quot; schedule &quot;  method is that it     offers a solution of the problem of reducing to some sort of order the present chaotic     arrangement which,  according to the  evidence before us,  results in substantially     different awards being made for permanent partial incapacity arising out of the same     kind of injury to the same type of workman,  according as the arbitration is heard in     one County Court circuit or another.  It is this uncertainty in respect of the  sum due     which is responsible for the bargaining between workmen and the agents of Insur-     ance Companies and Mutual Associations of which much complaint has been made     and which has led to cases where the Insurance Company offers one sum, the workman     demands a different sum, an agreement is arrived at between them, and that agreed     sum is substantially increased when it comes  before the Court for approval.         Various  &quot; disability  schedules &quot;  have  been worked out in  foreign countries     which differ  in method  as well as in the degree of elaboration.  So long ago  as     1904  the Russian  Ministry of  the Interior worked out an elaborate Table  for     the Determination of the Degree of Disability due to Injuries caused by Industrial     Accidents.*   Most of the American States provide for awards for specified injuries,     the last word being the schedule worked out  by the Industrial Accident Commission     of California,  after  a  careful  study and  comparison  of all existing disability     schedules.  This schedule is &quot;  a paper-bound book, 9  inches by 12J inches, and con-     &quot; taining about 70 pages,  comprising 12,711,240 possible combinations or ratings     &quot; which have been carefully computed and made readily understandable by a person     &quot; mentally competent to find in a railroad time-table when a train leaves &quot;.t  West     Virginia has a schedule  which  is  more flexible than the others, inasmuch as  it     establishes for specific injuries maximum and minimum rates between which awards     may be made, so enabling allowances to be made for the variation in the seriousness of     the same injury, according as the man is engaged in one occupation or another.  The     loss of the index finger means much more to a compositor than to a navvy.  Germany     has worked out several schedules, and France has  the elaborate guide bar erne,  for     the assessment of  disabilities  arising out of the War.   In England the Pensions     Warrant provides pensions for  specific injuries  proportionate  to the degjree  of     disablement, but not worked out to any great degree  of elaboration.         From the  information which is available it appears that  the  best  form  of     disability schedule is the subject of  controversy,  and that we are  still far from     the schedule which may be regarded as scientifically accurate.  At the same time,     a disability  schedule  dealing at first with the major injuries only and suggesting     rules  for guidance might do something to abolish that want of uniformity in awards     and  agreements for  permanent partial disability  which is so  serious  a blot     on our present system. The time at our  disposal does not permit us to investigate     the question  with the necessary thoroughness, but the matter is  one  which should     not be lost sight of,  and we  recommend that the proposed Commissioner should     institute the  necessary investigation and elaboration of a schedule, and  deal with     the same in his suggested reports to Parliament.68      Meanwhile, it is  necessary to consider whether any improvement  can otherwise     be effected in  the application of the existing &quot; percentage &quot; method of awarding com-     pensation for partial  incapacity in this country.         At present the proportion of &quot; the difference between the amount of the average     weekly earnings of the workman before the accident and the average weekly amount     which he is earning or is able to earn  in some suitable employment or business after     the accident &quot;  which may be  awarded  is  entirely  in the arbitrator^ discretion.         Here again emerges  that  want of uniformity to which we have already drawn     attention.  While it appears upon the evidence that the most usual  course is to award     half  the difference between  pre-accident and post-accident  wages,  it was also     stated that some Judges awarded less than half, some gave two-thirds, while others     awarded 100 per cent, of the difference.   * This table is set out in the  24th Annual Report  of the Commissioner  of  Labor (1909)Washington, p. 2,107 et seq.   t Bulletin  of the United States  Bureau of Labor Statistics, No.  212.  Proceedings  of theConference on Social Insurance, p. 179.
     Hitherto, the totally incapacitated workman has only been able to recover half the loss of his wage-earning capacity in the form of compensation.  We are unable to find any valid reason why the man who is only partially  disabled should recover a greater proportion of that loss.     If our recommendations are accepted, the future maximum for1 total incapacity will be two-thirds of the average weekly earnings.  We recommend that in the case of partial incapacity the weekly payment shall (subject to the maximum limit of compensation  fixed for total incapacity), be equal to two-thirds of the  difference between the amount of the average weekly earnings of the workman  before the accident and the average amount which he  is earning or is  able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident.     The grievance was urged upon us that no provision is made in the existing Act for taking account, in fixing compensation for partial disablement, of  any rise in the rate of wages applicable to the workman&apos;s occupation that may take place after the date of his accident.  The  result may be that a partially disabled man may receive- for the light  work he is capable of doing, wages equal to his pre-accident earnings and thus be  deprived of any compensation for his injury.     It appears to us that, in  the interests of the State, it is desirable  that this grievance should be remedied, because there is clearly no incentive for a man to  go back to work if by so doing he is to lose his compensation.     At  the same time, there are obvious objections to frequent  variations in  the assessment of  compensation, and to avoid this objection some minimum  limit  of variation should be prescribed as a condition precedent to any right to a review of compensation on this basis.     We recommend that where a partially incapacitated workman can show that the rate of wages generally paid by employers to workmen in that occupation  in the district  at the  time of his accident have at any time  thereafter increased by upwards of 20 per cent., he should be at liberty to claim compensation (subject to the same maximum limit) on the basis of the difference between what he is at present earning  or able to earn and what he would at that time have  been earning or able to earn had he received the benefit of the said rise.   The employer should, of course, be  entitled to make a corresponding  application for reduction in respect of a wage decrease.     This provision should not  apply to workmen under 21 years of age who are entitled to the benefit of the special provisions for minors contained in Clause (16)  of the First Schedule to the Act (see paragraph 70).                                 (c) Minors.     In the case of minors, special provision in regard to the scale of compensation is made as follows :-During total incapacity, if the workman is under 21, and earns less than  1 a  week, the compensation payable  is a sum not exceeding his average weekly earnings during the  preceding  12 months or any less period with the same employer, with a maximum of 10s.     By reason  of the  rise in wages for juvenile labour, the limit mentioned in this provision is now obsolete.  It was stated&apos;, for example, in evidence by representatives of the  Mining Association of Great Britain, that in mining all boys can now earn a good deal over   1 a week.   We accordingly had to consider  whether to  extend the existing  limit of wages as the basis  of special  treatment for persons under 21,  or whether  a principle which may have the result  of paying compensation  equivalent to earnings hould be abandoned in favour of other methods.     Various suggestions were made  for dealing with the case of minors earning comparatively low wages.  One suggestion was that varying percentage rates shouldbe prescribed for minors under 18, for those between 18 and 19, and for those between 19 and 20.   Another. suggestion  was  that the adult age might now be taken at 18,especially in the case  of  women, and that for those under  18 the present methodshould  be continued.  An alternative  is to abandon altogether methods based  onfixing a percentage of earnings differing from that fixed for adults and to rely onreview of weekly payments  as a means of adjusting  the compensation as circum-stances demand.     Already special provision is made for review in the case of minors by Clause 16of the First Schedule under which &quot; where the workman was at the date of the acci- &quot; dent  under twenty-one years of age, and the review takes place more than twelve
      &quot; months after the accident, the amount of the weekly payment may be increased to      &quot; any amount not exceeding fifty per cent, of the weekly sum which the workman      &quot; would probably have been earning  at the date of the review if he had remained      &quot; uninjured.&quot;          If this provision were amended to provide for opportunity of earlier review and      for an increase of the maximum compensation to  66f per cent, of the weekly  sum      (as recommended hereafter in paragraph 81), we  are of opinion,  taking into  con-      sideration the present rates of wages paid to minors,  that there  would be no longer      any need for providing a scale of compensation to minors based on a wage percentage      substantially higher than that awarded to adult workmen.          We recommend that proviso (b) of  Clause  (1)  (b)  of the First Schedule of the      1906 Act be deleted, and that no greater percentage of average weekly earnings be      payable to a minor for compensation  than is payable  to an adult workman; subject   &apos;   as above suggested to appropriate amendments being made to meet the case of minors      in the provisions relating to review.                                Sub-section 3 Generally.                                   (a)  Disfigurement.          The House of Lords, by their decision in Ball v.  William tiunt &amp; Sons, Ltd. 71   [1912], A.C. 496, held that disfigurement which was of such a character as to leave      the workman physically able to do his old work but which nevertheless prevented him      from getting such work, was properly  the subject of compensation.          In that case the workman lost an eye.  In the words of Earl Loreburn, L.C.,      &quot; The  result is alleged to have been that his disfigurement prevented his obtaining      &quot; employment  ....   The injury did not prevent him from being able to work,      &quot; but it did reduce him to a physical condition which  prevented, him  from getting      &quot; work suitable in the circumstances   ....  In my opinion if the County Court      &quot; Judge thinks these facts are established (as I gather he did think) he ought to      &quot; award compensation on the footing  of total or partial incapacity according as he      &quot; may  find.&quot;          It was urged upon us by a number of witnesses  that disfigurement  should be      the  subject  of  compensation even  though there  is no loss of  earning capacity.      Miss Susan Lawrence specially urged the claim of &quot; a girl burned on the face, a girl      who is scalped, a  girl who loses her little finger  .... a girl who loses an eye,&quot;      all cases of permanent damage where it: is &quot;sometimes very difficult indeed to put into      figures any loss of earning power at all,&quot; but which  &quot; might ruin her whole pleasure      in life.&quot;*         The Act at present provides compensation only in cases which fall into one of two      well-defined classes, death or incapacity.   To give  compensation for disfigurement      irrespective of any question of loss of earning capacity would be to include within      the Act an entirely new class of benefit.  Our recommendations in favour of increased      benefits for widows and children and for disabled workmen are such that we cannot      lightly contemplate the imposition of  additional burdens for new forms of benefit.      We do not feel at liberty  to recommend compensation for disfigurement, which does      not result in loss of earning capacity.  Cases where such loss of earning capacity      occurs  appear to be adequately met by the existing law.                           (b)  Successive  Contracts of  Service.                    %72      It was pointed out to  us by Judge  Sir Edward Bray that: in one respect  the     present provisions which govern the method of calculating average weekly earnings     were especially unfair, namely, in the case of a workman such as a casual dock     labourer &quot; habitually working for more than one employer but whose earnings under     &quot; the other employers cannot be taken into account unless he can bring himself within      &quot; Clause 2  (b) of  Schedule  I of the Act as working under concurrent contracts of     &quot; service, a  provision which  has  received from the Courts  a rather  narrow con-     &quot; struction.&quot;t         We recommend that  Clause (2) (b) of the First Schedule be amended so^ as to     place successive contracts of service in the same occupation on the same footing as     concurrent contracts.              ^_-__                                    * Lawrence, 651-2.                                    f Bray,  15,001,
                     (c) Transmission of a deceased dependant1s claim. 73      Where a dependant dies before a claim has been made, or, if a claim has been     made, before an agreement or award has been arrived at, the right to claim or receive     compensation passes to the dependants legal personal representative, who may be a     complete stranger.  Tims in the case  of United Collieries, Ltd., v. Simpson [1909]     A.C. 383, a workman was killed by an accident.  His mother, his only total dependant,     died without making any claim for compensation.   The mother&apos;s executrix made a     claim for compensation in respect of the mother&apos;s dependency.  The House of Lords     held the claim to be admissible.         We are of opinion that1 the Act was never intended to provide compensation to     a dependants  legal personal representative who possibly may be unable to show     any loss at all as a consequence of the workman&apos;s death.   We had  this and other     minor points in our minds when we decided upon the suggested increased benefits     for actual dependants, and consequently we recommend that the claim  of the legal     personal representative should be barred.                            Sub-section 4 Waiting Period.74      Under the provisions of the 1897 Act the workman was paid no compensation     in respect of any injury which  incapacitated him for less than two weeks, and was     not paid from a date earlier than the beginning of the third week after the accident.     The Committee of 1903 reported against the transfer to the employer of the  burden     of compensation for the whole or  any part of the first two weeks of incapacity.     During the passage of the Bill through Parliament, however, the somewhat complex     plan of the 1906 Act was adopted by way of compromise.   By this arrangement:  (a)     For incapacity lasting one week or less, no compensation is payable.   (6)  For inca-     pacity lasting more than one but  less than two weeks, compensation is payable,  but     only for the days after the first week,  (c) For incapacity lasting two  weeks or more,     compensation is payable from the commencement of incapacity.         There was a strong body of opinion in evidence that by reason of these provisions     there is an inducement for a workman who has to lie up for a few  days  in conse-     quence of an accident to extend his period of incapacity to 14 days so as to receive     compensation for the full period.         That  the number  of  cases of incapacity lasting  less than two  weeks has     strikingly  decreased under the 1906 Act  in one  particular district  and that  the     number in excess of two  weeks duration has increased in an  equally striking     manner is  brought out by the following figures submitted by Mr. Cooper, Solicitor     to the Durham Colliery Owners&apos; Mutual Protection Association and the Northum-     berland Coal Owners&apos; Mutual Protection Association.         &quot; In the counties of Durham and Northumberland, prior to the  passage of the     &quot; Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1897, the colliery owners paid a small  weekly sum     &quot; to injured workmen.   This was known as Smart money.   After the Act came into     &quot; operation, this payment was continued for the two weeks in respect of  which com-     &quot; pensation was not payable under the Act.   The figures show that  since the com-     &quot; mencement of the operation of the 1906 Act, which practically did away with  the     &quot; fortnight waiting period provided by the Act, the cases causing incapacity of less     &quot; than two weeks&apos; duration have decreased to an enormous extent, and those of longer     &quot; duration have correspondingly  increased,  The payments  of Smart money have     &quot; almost disappeared.

    &quot; Therefore,  taking 1906, the last year of the operation  of the 1897 Act, and&quot; 1918, the last calendar year for each county, you will see that in 1918, whilst the&quot; number  of  persons employed in Durham was  greater than it was  in  1906,  the&quot; number  of non-fatal accidents was  only  slightly  less;  the number of  cases&quot; of less  than  two weeks&apos;  duration  was  1,753, as compared with  9,786  before&quot; the 1906 Act  came into operation.   In other words, in 1918 only 10 per cent, of&quot; the non-fatal  cases caused less  than  two weeks&apos;  incapacity as against 546 in 1906.&quot; On the other hand, the cases where incapacity lasted for more than, two weeks rose&quot; from 8,145 in 1906 to 15,532 in 1918.  That is to say from 45&apos;4 per cent, of the&quot; total to  90 per cent, of  the total.   The figures for  Northumberland practically&quot; correspond.   The totals  are less because it  is a smaller coalfield, but the figures&quot; practically correspond with the Durham figures.&quot;^    Mr. Cooper comments on these figures in the following terms :     &quot; Of  course,  the increase in  the amount  of  non-fatal compensation rose enor-&quot; mously between 1906 and 1918, and it seemed  to me that these figures did show&quot; that the  effect of this provision in the 1906 Act was that the  men simply continued&quot; lying off work for more than 14 days so as to claim back from the first day.   That&quot; was only human nature.   If a man was  disabled for eleven days, supposing he&quot; was a singularly conscientious  man, without using the word offensively, he would&quot; only get four days&apos; compensation, whereas if he was not so particular, especially&quot; Saturday being a non-working  day, he would lie off for 14 days and get  the whole&quot; 14 days&apos;  compensation.   I do not blame him. It seems to me that to  expect a man&quot; to do otherwise is really putting too great a strain upon him.&quot;t    Mr. Cooper&apos;s conclusions are corroborated by the figures to be found  in  theHome Office  Workmen&apos;s Compensation  Statistics for 1913 in relation to  the sevenleading industries already referred to.   The table is as follows : Year.	Total.	Percentage of Cases terminated in which compensation had lasted.

A variety of suggestions was made for the amendment of the existing provisionsas to the waiting period.  The suggestion strongly urged on behalf of the workmanwas that compensation should be paid from the date of the accident.  It appears tous, however, that to abolish the waiting period  altogether would  result in a vastnumber of trivial claims and that employers would be in the dilemma of either having to spend considerable time and money investigating a multitude of small claims or of paying them without proper enquiry on the ground  that it was cheaper.   Eithercourse is objectionable.    The proposal which also had a large body  of support was  that compensation should be payable in  all instances on and from  the fourth day after the accident,the first three days being excluded.  This coincides with the rule under the national insurance Act, 1913,  by which  Sickness Benefit  is payable  from the fourth day of incapacity.    A waiting period of three days with no dating back appears to be the  betterplan,  and we recommend its adoption.                                 * Cooper 6118                                 f Cooper 6120,
                    SECTION 2. MEDICAL AND  SURGICAL AID.     We have been much impressed with the evidence of numerous representatives of employers, and of Trade Unions and the Insurance Companies, as to the necessity for a comprehensive system of medical and  surgical services with a view to the rehabilitation of the injured workman and the restoration of his earning capacity.     In some of the United States of America extensive provision of this kind exists, but in this country, apart from the voluntary action of some far-sighted employers, and certain Insurance  Companies and Mutual  Associations,  no  treatment of this nature is specially provided beyond the somewhat restricted scope of the Medical Benefit under the National Health Insurance  Acts.   There appears to  be no valid reason, apart from the question  of expense, why adequate medical and surgical services   should  not   be  furnished.   It is  admitted  that  adequate medical treatment will the more quickly restore the earning capacity of  the workman and consequently reduce the compensation cost.  This saving to the employer would be a considerable set-off against, if  it did not wholly balance, the cost of  the treatment, especially as the existing medical services under the National Health Insurance Acts would reduce the field which any new provision under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act would need to cover.     The  National Health Insurance Acts cover about 15,000,000 insured persons and in this respect are practically coterminous with the  Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.   Apart from Ireland (where no medical benefit  is provided, and where  about 700,000 persons are insured under the National Health Insurance Acts),  all these persons are entitled to  medical treatment, which is defined  in the Medical Benefit Regulations as follows :            &quot; The treatment which a practitioner is required to give to his patients       &quot; comprises such treatment as is of a kind which can consistently with the best       &quot; interests of the patient be properly undertaken by a general practitioner of       &quot; ordinary professional competence and skill.&quot;     It is obvious that, in order to provide such a complete and comprehensive scheme of medical and surgical treatment as would be necessary in the case of injuries inci- dental to  employment,  some further  services must be superimposed upon  those already available under National Health Insurance.   We refer particularly  to various special services, including those of expert physicians  and surgeons, massage, X-Rays (for diagnosis as well  as treatment), hydro-therapeutic and other kinds  of treatment  not requiring residence of the patient in a hospital or other residential institution, in-patient hospital  treatment, convalescent homes,  and such  supervisory medical arrangements as would secure proper co-ordination of the  different branches of treatment.   We cannot but think that efficient treatment of this kind, having for its objects the saving of life, relieving suffering  and restoring working  capacity, is as important to workmen as monetary compensation for temporary loss of wages and ultimate diminution (if any) of  working capacity, and from  the point of view of the  community, a scheme directed  towards these ends is most desirable.    We do not think that the need for this treatment could be satisfactorily met by including in the monetary compensation the amount necessary to enable the workman himself to defray the cost, nor by placing the onus of providing the treatment upon the  employers.    The  solution appears  to   us  to lie  in  the  direction of  an extension of the medical services already available under the National Health Insur- ance Acts.  We understand that the Ministry of Health has under consideration a further development of medical services for the &quot;benefit of the population generally, and we recommend that the extra services for injured workmen  under  the Work- men&apos;s Compensation Act should be co-ordinated with the arrangements made by the Ministry.   The  expenses of such extra services should be provided by the employers,because the need for them has been created directly by the risks of employment, andthey will have a material effect  in  reducing the amount of monetary compensations    *payable under the Act.  As we are informed  that the proposals of the Ministry ofHealth have not yet matured, we are unable to  formulate a definite scheme.  We are,however,  in a position to recommend that medical and surgical  treatment of thenature indicated above should be included in the new Act as an additional benefit, and that provision  should be made for bringing  such benefit into force by Order inCouncil (the draft, of which Order should be previously submitted to and approved byParliament) as  from  a  date to be fixed in the  Order,  In view of the working   29358                                             .                     P   &apos;
 arrangement with the Insurance Companies, the benefit should be treated as part of the claims cost, and  the  most opportune  moment  for  the  commencement of the additional benefit will be when the triennial revision of rates is taking place.                     SECTION 3.-FIRST Am AND AMBULANCE.     The importance of First Aid  and Ambulance treatment in  preventing trivial injuries from developing into serious cases as a result of septic  infection or blood poisoning, and also in mitigating the effects of serious accidents  and so expediting the workman^ return to work, cannot be overestimated; and the  evidence before us shows that there is a general recognition among employers of the desirability both on economic and humanitarian grounds of providing proper First Aid and ambulance - lance facilities wherever practicable.   Provisions in regard to First Aid and ambulance- lance are already in force under the General Regulations made under the Coal Mines Act, 1911, at all mines to which that Act applies, and at certain metalliferous mines and quarries under Special Rules made under the Metalliferous Mines and Quarries Acts.   As regards factories and workshops, the Home  Office is  empowered under Section 7 (1) of the Police, Factories, &amp;c. (Miscellaneous Provisions)  Act,  1916, to make Orders requiring the provision of Ambulance and First Aid arrangements at any specified works or class of works, and there are several Orders already in force for various industries, including blast furnaces,  foundries, and certain other metal works, and wood-working factories.  We are of opinion and we understand that this is already contemplated by the Home Office that these requirements should be extended, if not to all factories and  workshops, at  any rate to all works where machinery is in use or any other definite source of danger exists or  where a sub- stantial number of workers are employed.    We think also that similar provisions should be applied to docks; constructional work  and  building,  and recommend that  the necessary statutory powers should - be obtained for this purpose.                   SECTION  4 TRAINING  OF DISABLED MEN.    A number of workmen disabled by industrial accidents, while  they recover their capacity for work, are rendered unfitted to  carry on their previous occupation.  A certain proportion of these would be capable, if the necessary facilities were avail- able, of being trained  for some other occupation, to  the advantage  of themselves, their employers, and the State.    We have had the benefit  of evidence  from Sir James Currie,  the  Director of the  department concerned  in the Ministry of Labour, as to the working of the arrangements now in force for the training of disabled soldiers.  It appears that the selection of the men for training is in the hands of local technical advisory committees representative of employers and workmen, who determine, having  regard to the age of the workman and other considerations, whether or not he is suitable for training for any particular trade.   Generally speaking, Sir James Currie thought that ex- perience indicates that a workman over 30 years of age is not sufficiently adaptable. The usual course of training consists of a period varying from 6 to 18  months in one of the  instructional factories  of the Crown  which are situated at different centres throughout the county, followed by a period of 18 months as an &quot;  Improver &quot; in an ordinary factory in the industry, after which the man,  if competent, is admitted to the trade at the ordinary rates of pay.    Sir James Currie thought that it would be feasible to make similar arrangements in the case of  men  disabled by industrial accidents, subject to two conditions: (a)  that the scheme had the whole hearted  co-operation of the Trade Unions; and (b) that it could be worked with reasonable economy.    As to the first condition, the matter is not one which, so far as we are aware, has been formally considered by the Trade Unions and, while we have taken the oppor- tunity  to discuss it with certain Trade Union representatives, who have given evi- dence before us,  we are not in a position to make any authoritative statement as tothe views of the  Trade Unions.    As to the second condition, the training of disabled soldiers is admittedly  veryexpensive, and assuming that a  preliminary period of training in an instructional factory is necessariy (and Sir James Currie informs  us  that as far  as the highly skilled trades are concerned,  it is unanimously so regarded both by employers and employed and by the technical experts of the Ministry of Labour), the cost in the caseof disabled workmen would undoubtedly be serious.   Much, however,  would depend
on whether it was found necessary to set aside one or two instructional factories ex-clusively for the training of these workmen or whether, in the event of the existinginstructional factories being taken over, say, by educational authorities in connectionwith schemes of industrial training, facilities could be granted for the training ofdisabled workmen at these factories.    In these  circumstances, it is obvious that it would be premature for us to makeany definite  proposal for legislation on  this subject.   The matter is, however,clearly one deserving further investigation,  and we recommend that the proposedCommissioner should enquire into the question  with  the Ministry of Labour andany other authorities concerned, and with the Employers&apos; Associations and TradeUnions, in order to ascertain whether any practicable and economic scheme  can be worked  out.                                 PART  VI.                         NOTICE   OF  ACCIDENT.    By the existing law notice of an accident must be given by a workman as soonas practicable after the happening thereof, and before he has voluntarily left theemployment in which he was injured.  Such notice can be excused upon proof thatthe employer has not been prejudiced or if the failure to give notice arises from mis-take of fact, absence from the United Kingdom or other reasonable cause (Section 2).    This subject was referred to by many witnesses, and there is no doubt that thepresent provisions cause hardship to an injured workman in a considerable numberof cases where he has failed to give notice. We were informed that this often happenswhere a workman has sustained a &quot;slight injury causing, for example, an abrasionof the skin which at a later date develops into septic poisoning, or where a workmanhas been ruptured and does not appreciate, or in  some cases recognise,  his injuryuntil  it  further develops at a later  date.  The difficulty is how best  to assist theinjured workman and yet afford reasonable protection to the employer.    Judge Ruegg, K.C., suggested in evidence  that the words &quot; as soon as practic-able &quot; should be omitted and provision  made that compensation should  not be payable until notice of accident had been given, and then only from the date of thenotice of accident.    Other  witnesses  suggested that  any provision requiring notice  of accidentshould be omitted,  or, in any event, that no notice of accident should be requiredin case of death or in other cases where the employer had knowledge of the fact fromother  sources.    On the other hand, representatives of the employers strongly advocated thenecessity of notice  for the  protection of the employer, and also  to enable him toprovide immediate treatment for the workman.    We  recommend that the existing law should be altered  to provide  expresslythat:       1.  In all mines, quarries,  factories,  workshops and such  other  industrial             establishments as  shall be from time to time specified in Regulations             by the proposed Commissioner, the employer should be required                 (a) to exhibit notices in conspicuous places  informing  the work-                       men of the necessity for notice of every accident, whether                       trivial or otherwise, to be given to a designated person;                 (b) to keep an accident book  (to which the workman should have                       access), in which an entry should be made of all ascertained                       accidents.      2.   The  defence of want, defect or inaccuracy of notice should  not be open             to an employer                 (a) where  the accident is recorded in the  said accident book, or                       the workman establishes that the employer had other know-                       ledge of the accident at or about the time of its occurrence, or                 (b) until the employer establishes that the said notices had been                       exhibited and the said accident book kept, or                (c) until he has established that  he has been prejudiced  in  his                       defence by the want, defect or inaccuracy of notice.  29358                                                                  P 2
                                     PART  VII.                        REVIEW  OF WEEKLY  PAYMENT. 79       The present law (Schedule I, clause 16), provides that any weekly payment may     be reviewed at the request of the employer or of the workman, and on such review     may be ended, diminished or increased, and that the amount of the payment in de-     fault of an agreement should be settled by arbitration.          We were informed in evidence that the present practice where weekly payments     have been made, but no agreement has been recorded, is for the employer, where he     contends that the condition of the workman has altered, to stop payment and leave     the workman to commence  arbitration proceedings,  and this often means that by     the time the case is heard, the workman has been for many weeks  without com-     pensation.   It was pressed upon us on  behalf of the  workmen that it should be     obligatory upon the employer in every case, in default of agreement, to  apply     to the arbitrator for a review of the weekly payment, and that pending review the em-     ployer should be liable to continue the then existing weekly payment.          We recommend that the Act should be amended so  as to provide that all weekly     payments shall continue to be payable until altered by agreement or by an order     of the.arbitrator.   We think, however, that some  protection should be provided for     the employer, and accordingly further recommend that, where a difference arises as     to the  workman&apos;s fitness for work, power should be given to the Registrar, upon an     ex parte application by the employer, to make an interim order reducing or sus-     pending the weekly payment pending the issue being dealt with by the arbitrator.80-       In this connection  a  further question was  raised  with  regard to  the     position of  the  injured  workman  who is fit to undertake  light work.   Com-     plaint was made on behalf of the workman that his right to compensation, if work     is not available, is not clearly defined,  and  that the conception  of his position     under the provisions of the Act differs in various County Court districts.  It was     urged before us by more than one witness that the County Court Judge  should not     have power to make an order reducing the amount of compensation until the employer     has satisfied him that light work is in fact available for the workman.   After con-     sideration, we recommend that the provisions of the Act  should be amended definitely     to provide that (a)  the onus of proving the workman&apos;s capacity for work should     rest upon the employer; (&amp;) if a workman applies  for a review the onus should rest     upon him of proving that he is unable to obtain work which he can do;  and (c) where     an application is made by an employer for  a reduction of the weekly payment, the     onus should  rest upon him of establishing that work of a description which would     justify the reduction of the compensation is normally available in the district.81      In regard to minors, the present law is that, where the workman at the time of     the accident is under 21 years of age, and the review takes place more than 12 months     after the accident, the amount of the weekly payment may be increased to any amount     not exceeding 50 per cent, of the weekly sum which the workman  would probably     have been earning at the date of the review if he had remained uninjured,  but not in     any case exceeding  1.         It was pointed out to us that singularly little advantage was taken of this section     for the reason  that infants  were not sufficiently aware of their rights, and it was     n.obodv&apos;s business to protect them.   Moreover, bv the decision in  Marshall, Sons &amp;     Co., Ltd., v. Prince, 7 B.W.C.C.  755, it was held that if the employer  applies to     redeem an infanfs weekly payments after 6 months, and before 12 months, he can     do so on the basis of the existing weekly payment,  as the infant cannot apply under     the above provision for review until after the expiration of 12 months. In the case     referred to, the Master of the Rolls said : &quot; It has  been argued  that it  is a great   -  &quot;  hardship that an infant should be liable to be redeemed on  what is  an obviously     &quot;  an unfair basis.  This, however, is a matter not for the consideration  of this Court,     &quot;  but the Legislature.&quot;         We recommend that powers  of review  be given during minority at any time     after 6 months from the date of the accident, and that the 50 per cent,  should be     increased to 66f per  cent., and the maximum from  1 to the  proposed general     maximum of  3.         We further recommend that there be no power  to redeem, compulsorily the weekly     compensation of a workman under the age of 21.82      It will be convenient in this place to refer to the decision in Johnson v. Henrv     Liston  &amp; Company (1919) 12 B.W.C.C. 224.  where it was held that a workman on     attaining his maiority, was absolutely entitled to the money paid into Court under     agreement in settlement of a claim, and that the Judge had no power to control it
    We are of opinion that the County Court  Judge should  have full discretion as to the application of all lump sums paid into Court  for the benefit of minorseven after the minor&apos;s attainment of his majority.                                     PART  VIII.                       COMMUTATION   AND   REDEMPTION.                        SECTION 1.-AGREEMENTS FOR LUMP SUMS. gg       Under the existing law, the employer and  the workman may always agree at     any time to settle a claim to compensation by payment of a lump sum.          Divergent views were placed before  us as  to the  desirability or otherwise of     prohibiting all lump sum settlements and insisting on compensation being paid in     the  form of  weekly amounts during  the whole period of incapacity.  Those in     favour of the prohibition of lump sum settlements based their arguments upon the     frequent cases where the lump sum had been squandered.  There was also evidence     from the Ministry of Pensions that, as to gratuities, &quot; on the whole they were not     successful.&quot;.  It was further urged that if the possibility of lump sum settlements     was altogether absent, the workman would be  more likely to concentrate on getting     better.         - On the other hand, cogent arguments setting forth the desirability of settling     weekly payments  by a lump sum were  presented from various sources.   The     employers wished to preserve the power  of redemption, because for business pur-     poses it is desirable from their point of view finally to  determine the liability.  An     important consideration urged by several  witnesses was that lump sum settlements     were eminently desirable in neurotic and neurasthenic cases.  To quote the evidence     of an employer whose  knowledge covered a long period, &quot; Experience has shown     &quot; that in cases of strain, particularly if the subject is neurotic,  a settlement of the     &quot; claim with consequent termination of mental anxiety and brooding is invariably     &quot; followed by  a resumption of work sooner than could have been expected  if the     &quot; weekly  payment were  continued indefinitely. &quot;*   Further, Judge  Sir  Edward     Bray said, &quot; There is no doubt that once  the  thing is  settled by the payment of a     lump sum, somehow the man gets better.&quot;!         Again, there are undoubtedly cases where,  with the amount  of  capital which     the lump  sum provides,  the injured workman or perhaps his  wife is able to establish     a business, and although many cases have arisen where the money so invested has     been lost, we think that if a man or his wife has had some business training, they may     very well, with the capital of the lump sum, obtain a higher income  than they did     before the accident.         There is also the case of disputed liability,  which  is the reasonable subject of     compromise, where the  employer or his Insurance Company without unfairness to     the workman says, &quot; We dispute the  claim,  but  it will cost us  50 to fight  it.     We will therefore pay you  50 to settle the matter.&quot;         It must be recognised that  lump sum settlements  are popular with workmen.     In the words of one witness, &quot; You will do one  of the most unpopular acts if you     abolish lump sums.&quot;f         Upon consideration we do not recommend the prohibition of  lump sum settle-     ments.         The control by means of registration of agreements for lump sums is a matter to84  which the Association of County Court Registrars has given much  consideration,     and in a valuable memorandum, in which they  urge the  desirability of legislation to     protect the workman from bartering away his rights under the Act for an inadequate     lump sum, they trace the manner in which the existing condition of affairs has come     about.         The Act  provides that in the case of  injuries to workmen  not resulting  in     death, the compensation shall be a weekly  payment during incapacity.         The commutation of such weekly payment  by the acceptance of a lump sum     is not forbidden, but it  is provided by clause 9 of the Second Schedule to the Act:     &quot; Where the amount of compensation under this Act has been ascertained  ....     &quot; a  memorandum thereof shall be  sent  ....  to  the registrar of the county     &quot; Court who shall  ....   on being satisfied as to its genuineness, record such         * Johnstone, 6230 ; 6356.      t Bray, 15,200.

u memorandum.....and thereupon the memorandum shail for ail purposes&quot; be  enforceable  as a county court judgment &quot;; and  by  Clause 9  (d) &quot; Where it&quot; appears to the registrar of the county court, on any information which he con-&quot; siders sufficient, that an agreement as to the redemption of a weekly payment by a&quot; lump sum   ....   ought not to- be registered by reason of the inadequacy of&quot; the sum or amount  ....  he may refuse to record the memorandum of the&quot; agreement sent to him for registration, and refer  the  matter to the judge who&quot; shall, in accordance with rules of court, make such order (including an order as to&quot; any sum already paid under  the agreement) as, under the  circumstances, he may&quot; think just.&quot;    By Clause 10 of the same Schedule, &quot; An agreement as to the redemption of&quot; a weekly payment by a lump sum if not registered in  accordance with this  Act&quot; shall not, nor shall the payment of the sum payable  under the agreement, exempt&quot; the person by whom the weekly payment is payable from, liability to continue to&quot; make that weekly payment.&quot;    In Ryan v. Hartley [1912] 2 KB.  150, the Court of Appeal decided that the clauses of the Second.Schedule cited above have no application where the  agreement to pay a  lump sum in lieu of weekly payments has been come to before any weeklypayments have in fact been made.  This decision was followed in Fox v. BatterseaBorough  Council, 4 B.W.  C.C. 261, and Hudson v.  Camberwell Borough Council,116,  L.T. 523.     In Rawlings, Ltd.  v. Hodgson, 87 L.J., K.B. 761, it was decided by the sameCourt that even if weekly payments  had been made in pursuance of  an  agree-ment express or implied,  but  a question had  subsequently arisen as to whetherthe liability for such weekly payments continued, an  agreement to pay a lump  Assuming extinguishment of such liability was  not an agreement for the redemption of a weekly payment which  required the approval of the  Registrar or  Judge as  to the adequacy of the amount  before registration under the Act.  In other words, theRegistrars duty was only to consider whether the agreement was a genuine  one,and  if it was genuine,  he must record  it.     The result of these decisions  is that if the employer (or  more frequently inpractice  his Mutual Association or Insurance Company) agrees with the workmanto settle his claim under the Act by payment of a lump sum before  any weekly pay-ments have been made, or if, after some such payments, the employer disputes liabilityand  then compromises by agreement to pay a lump sum, the adequacy of the amountagreed to be paid does not come under the consideration of an independent authority,namely the Registrar or the Judge.     According  to the  evidence  of  Mr. Lowe,  the Registrar  of  BirminghamCounty Court, &quot; the result of recent decisions is that  an increasing number of cases are now being taken outside the Registrars jurisdiction by the simple expedientof not making any weekly payment, or stopping compensation for  a fortnight andthen filing an agreement for a  lump sum.&quot;*     Judge Sir  Edward  Bray, in giving expression before us to the collectiveviews of the English  County  Court  Judges, referred to the matter in these terms: &quot; Workmen are in many  cases induced to accept quite inadequate sums.&quot; either before any compensation has been paid, or when, some payments having  been(C made, they are stopped.....Even where the agreement ought to be recorded,,&quot; the insurance  companies frequently  prefer to run the  risk and refrain from an&quot; application to record it in order to avoid the interference of the Judges,&quot;!  and he stated that all the Judges were strongly of opinion that any lump sum agreement insatisfaction of the liability to make weekly payments under the Act should be invalidunless recorded, and should not be recorded unless approved  by Registrar orJudge.f     Mr.  Shennan, the Sheriff Substitute of Lanarkshire, informed us that it was the unanimous opinion of the Sheriffs Substitute that&quot; all lump  sum payments in satis-&quot; faction of claims for compensation should require  the sanction  of the Court in&quot; some form.  ....   In the general interest it is desirable that every case of&quot; compounding a claim for compensation at whatever stage it is made should be sub-&quot; ject to control.  I should like to amplify that by saying we intend that to cover&quot; cases where a man compounds a claim for his injury even before the employer&quot; admits liability to pay compensation.&quot; J* Lowe, 9214.     \ Bray, 15,037.     \ Bray, 15,016.      $  Shennan, 21,053; 21,064.
    It should be added that Mr. W. E. Gray, giving evidence on behalf of the Acci-dent Offices Association assured us  that  Insurance Companies would prefer thatall agreements should be approved by the Registrar, and that  they do  not approve of their agents taking advantage of the injured workman.*    The only objections raised were that to insist on the approval of the county court in the case of every agreement would be further to encroach upon the general rule that an adult should be at liberty to make his own bargain, and that a  partywho has settled a weak case may have to disclose such weakness  to the Judge who,if he disapproves of the settlement, may subsequently have to try the issue involved.    If agreements for lump sums in cases where liability is disputed were exceptedfrom registration, a wide door would be opened to evasion.    In our opinion, every agreement by a workman with his employer to accept a lump sum in satisfaction of the liability under the Act, or which has  the effect ofprecluding him from claiming under the Act, in respect of  an accident, should besubject to the approval of the County Court Registrar, who should  have power torefuse  to record the  agreement on  any grounds he  considers sufficient, and upon such refusal should refer  the agreement to  the Judge.  We  recommend  that theprovisions in the Schedule should be amended accordingly.    It is important that the Registrar  should have adequate powers to enable himto make his review of lump sum agreements effective.  At present his only powers are (No.  51 (2)  of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Rules) to &quot; make  such  further&quot; enquiries and obtain such further information as he may think necessary in order&quot; to satisfy himself that the memorandum may properly be recorded,&quot; i.e., whether&quot; an agreement as to the redemption of a weekly payment by a lump sum  ....&quot; ought not to be registered by reason of the inadequacy of the sum.&quot;   (Schedule II.(9) (5).)  He has no power to call for medical reports, nor to require the attendance of the parties.   Mr. Light, the Registrar of  Whitechapel County Court, stated thatin his experience the workman had no medical report, so that they merely got the employees  side of the medical position; also that &quot; we always send for both  sides,&quot; but we have no power to compel them to come and very often they do not come.&quot;t    We accordingly  recommend that power be  given  to the Registrar in the caseof all lump sum agreements to      (a)  require  the  production  of medical reports and to  refer  them,  when            conflicting, to a Medical Referee for an independent report.      (6)  require the attendance before him of the parties to the agreement.      (c)  postpone registration,  subject to  appeal to the County Court Judge, in            cases  where no definite view can be formed of  the man&apos;s  prospects of            recovery,  or  where  for any  other sufficient reason it appears to him            advisable so to do.    With these  powers at their  disposal Registrars  should be able adequately toprotect workmen against improvident bargains.    Under Section 11 of the National Health Insurance Act,  1911, the Health In-surance Funds are relieved of liability in respect of periods of accident or industrial disease if, and so far as, financial assistance is available to the insured person  underthe Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,  1906, or any Scheme certified thereunder, orunder the Employers&apos; Liability Act, 1880, or at common law, while he is incapacitated.    In view of this financial interest of  Approved Societies in  the  amounts to bereceived  by  injured  workmen in agreements  made  for  lump   sums   underthe Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, we consider that at least ten days&apos; notice of every such agreement when  submitted to  the  Registrar for approval  and registrationshould be given  to the  injured workman&apos;s Approved  Society,  and power should begiven to the Approved Society to be represented before the Registrar if it is desiredto raise any objection to the registration by the Registrar of the said agreement.    In order to obviate delay in the notincation of the agreement by the Registrarto the Approved Society, the name of the Approved  Society in which the insuredworkman is insured should appear, if possible, on the memorandum of agreement.          SECTION  2. COMPULSORY REDEMPTION OF WEEKLY  PAYMENTS.    Where weekly payments have been made, the employer but not the workman--is entitled  at the expiration of six months to redeem the weekly payments.   In caseswhere the incapacity is permanent the amount is determined under Clause (17) of them&amp;8* W. E. Gray, 17,919 ; 18,035.t Light, 10,676 ; 10,713-4.
                                PART  IX.                     SETTLEMENT  OF  DISPUTES.    The following summary represents the law upon this point as it exists to-day:     By Section 1 (3):  &quot; If any question arises in any proceedings under this Act as&quot; to the liability to pay compensation under this Act (including any question as to&quot; whether the person injured is a workman to whom this Act applies), or as to the&quot;amount or duration of compensation under this Act, the question, if not settled by&quot; agreement, shall, subject to the provisions of the first Schedule to this Act, be settled&quot;by arbitration, in accordance with the Second Schedule to this Act.&quot;    The  same procedure  is applied to  questions arising under Section 4 (2)  (In-demnity : sub-contracting), Section 6  (2)  (Indemnity : negligence) First Schedule (16)(Review); First Schedule (17)  (Redemption).    The arbitration tribunal under the Second Schedule may be any of four forms :        (i) A Committee representative of employers and workmen (Clause  (1)).       (ii) A single arbitrator agreed upon by the parties (Clause (2)).      (iii) The County Court  Judge (Clause (2)).      (iv) In England only,  a single arbitrator appointed by the County  Court            Judge with the authority of the Lord Chancellor (Clause (3)).    By Clause  (16) of the Second  Schedule the Secretary of State is empowered toconfer by Order on any Committee representative of an employer and his workmen,as respects any matter in which the Committee act as arbitrators, or which is settled by agreement submitted to and approved by the Committee, all or any of the powers conferred  by the  Act exclusively  on  County Courts,  and  may  by the  Orderprovide how and to whom  the compensation money is to be paid in cases where, butfor the Order, the money would be required to be paid into court, and the Order mayexclude from the operation of provisoes (d) and (e) of paragraph  9 of the  Scheduleagreements submitted to and approved by the Committee.First Schedule on an annuity basis, but where the incapacity is only temporary theamount is fixed by arbitration.    The view that the workman should have the same right to demand commutationas the employer has to demand redemption, was  urged upon us by practically thewhole of the witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the workmen.  It was objectedfor the employers that as the employer has to pay the compensation, it should rest with him to say whether or not it should, take the form  of  a lump sum or shouldcontinue as a weekly payment; also  that a number of demands for commutationmight embarrass the employer, especially if the benefits were  largely increased.    We have come to the  conclusion that the workman&apos;s  grievance  can in themain be met if the employees right to redeem weekly compensation.by the paymentof a lump sum is left to the discretion of the arbitrator and we recommend accordingly.    We were influenced in arriving at this conclusion by the fact that circumstances may arise  which render it essential for the  liability to be  disposed of as, forinstance, in the case of the winding-up of a company.   It was also established thatthe right to redeem in the case of permanent incapacity was seldom exercised.                        SECTION 3.-SOLICITORS&apos; COSTS.    It was urged upon  us  by a number of witnesses, including the County. CourtRegistrars,  that in  agreements  for  lump  sums the amount agreed to  bepaid to the Solicitor for the  injured workman for costs should be set out in the agree-ment and power given to the Registrar to review the same.  It was pointed out thatit is not fair to the workman to say &quot; We have agreed to settle the case for   60 and agreed costs &quot; when the employer has paid for compensation and costs the sum of 100 in settlement of the claim.    We agree with the suggestion  and recommend accordingly.    Under the existing law no Court Fee is payable in respect of proceedings priorto award (Schedule II.  (13)).  Judge Ruegg, K.C., Urged that no fees should becharged on payment into Court, investment, or variation of an Order, and it waspointed out that committees do not charge such fees.  It certainly seems a hardshipthat when a sum is paid into Court in respect of the death  of a workman a deductionshould be made therefrom when it is invested by the Registrar.  We would direct the attention of the Treasury to Judge Ruegg&apos;s evidence on this point.
                               SECTION 1. COMMITTEES.90       Tlie advantages  of arbitration by committees representative of employers and1     workmen were fully  recognised by witnesses representing both sides.   The more     obvious advantages are freedom from the restrictions of legal procedure, avoidance     of delay, absence of  friction and reduced expense.  The practical knowledge of     the conditions and circumstances of the particular industry is always  most helpful     and in particular assists the tribunal  readily to determine to what extent a specific     injury incapacitates a workman from  working at his trade.         The authors of the first Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act undoubtedly appreciated     this.  Sir M. W. Ridley, the then Home Secretary, in introducing the Bill, referred     to the subject in the following terms :  &quot; Our hope is with regard to arbitration that     committees will be established between employers and men to settle the question. &quot;*         It is to be  regretted that  owing, we fear, largely to want of confidence and     co-operation between  employers and  workmen,  this hope has not been fulfilled.     Committees have, so far as  we  are aware, been established only for the coalmining     industry in the Counties of  Durham and  Cumberland.         The success  of the Joint Committees representative of the coal  trade in the     County of Durham deserves more than casual notice.!         Immediately the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1897, was passed, an agreement     was entered  into between the Durham Coal Owners&apos; Association and  the Durham     Miners&apos; Association, by which  provision was made for a committee, consisting of     three members of each of the two Associations and the two Secretaries, to consider     any disputed cases. Similar agreements were entered into between the Coal Owners&apos;     Association and four other Associations representing other classes of men employed     in or about  the  mines.  The great bulk of  the  claims,  however,  come from the     Miners&apos;Association.         The Durham  Committee has found it an advantage not to have a  permanently     appointed chairman.   A chairman is appointed at each sitting, but he has no power     to give a decision. Moreover,  the power to resort to the County Court in case of     disagreement among the members of the Committee remains.   For a decision by the     Committee itself, absolute agreement is required.   If disagreement arises the  Com-     mittee agree to differ and the case, if pressed, goes to the County Court.         Joint Committees have  also been in existence at the pits belonging to members     of the Cumberland Coal Owners&apos; Association since July,  1898.  These Committees     deal with all disputed compensation claims in the Cumberland coal field, and  settle     the amount due to dependants of deceased  workmen and award lump sums in redemp-     tion of weekly payments in total and partial incapacity cases.   Each committee is a     standing committee consisting of eight members, four on the side of the employers     and four on the side of the workmen.         The general secretary, or, in his absence, the financial secretary of the Miners&apos;     Association is the Chairman of each Committee  and the general manager of the     Indemnity Company acts as secretary, and they have so acted since the Committees     were first formed.         Orders under Schedule II.  (16) of the Act have been made in favour of each of     the Durham and Cumberland Committees.         We considered the advisability of the compulsory establishment of joint com-     mittees organised by trades or districts.         In view, however, of the fact that such committees depend for success  on their     voluntary character and on the  good feeling between employers and workmen which     such voluntary association implies, we  do  not recommend any alteration in the exist-     ing law, but we would urge  all  employers and workmen in well organised trades to     follow the example of the coal trade  in  Durham and Cumberland and  form com-     mittees representative of employers and workmen to settle questions arising under     the Act.         All additional powers proposed to be vested in the County Court Judges and     Registrars under the  new Act should  be  included (so far  as applicable) among the     powers which the  Secretary  of State may, by order, confer on  any committee repre-     sentative of employers and workmen under  the provisions of  Clause (16) of the     Second Schedule.                           SECTION 2-THE COUNTY COURT.Q1       The single arbitrator is practically never used, and in practice the County Court     has become the usual tribunal.____              * House of Commons, 3rd May, 1897.              ! For details of the work of the Committee see evidence, Cooper 5910-6039.
     We are satisfied, from the evidence before us from witnesses representing both employers and workmen, that the County Court has given satisfaction as a tribunal. Nevertheless, the formality-which is a necessary and important feature of the ad- ministration of justice  in the Law Courts-causes delay and considerable expense to the parties and we have  anxiously considered whether it is possible to improve upon the present system in these respects.     In America, where we find the simplest procedure,  the general practice in the various States is to appoint an Industrial Accident Board, whose mam duty it is to see that the law is enforced and that the workman  receives the  compensation to which he is  entitled.   The  proceedings  before  these Tribunals are more or  less informal, and we were told in evidence by  an eminent  American  lawyer of large experience, that a successful  feature of their work was giving information to injured workmen as to their rights, and making all reasonable efforts to conciliate and bring the parties to an agreement.    An ultimate right of appeal from these Boards to the Courts on issues of law is generally provided, and it is interesting to note that decisions on Workmen&apos;s Com- pensation Law occupy many  pages of the American Law Reports.     In the United Kingdom, unfortunately, there  are  no means  provided  in the Act for  advising or assisting an injured workman or for bringing the employers and workmen together if an issue arises between them, and evidence was before us of many cases of hardship in consequence thereof.    We were gratified to be  informed by many witnesses  that where a workman is a member of a Trade Union the officials of that Trade Union generally assist him when injured in making and prosecuting his claim, to the advantage of the employers and the workmen, and further, that the Trade Union representatives and representatives of the Insurance Companies and Mutual Associations  have regular meetings, at which they discuss claims and settle many of them.    Another advantage of the American system  is that the Accident Boards, regu-lated  from a head office,  arrive at uniformity of practice in dealing with agreements in settlement of claims, and in making awards.  This  is an advantage which is necessarily lacking in a  system where there are many County Courts.  In Englandalone the business is conducted by some 56 County Court Judges and 474 Registrars.In this connection we had evidence before us to the effect that terms of settlementthat would be passed by one County Court Judge would not meet with the approvalof another, and that the same set of facts might produce varying awards accordingto the angle from which they were regarded by different Judges, and, further, thatagreements that pass one Registrar are rejected by others.    We  should state that this evidence was not placed  before  us  by way of com- plaint or as expressing  dissatisfaction with the decisions  of any particular  Judge or Registrar, but as recording facts  that are recognised  by the representatives of Trade Unions, Insurance Companies and Mutual  Associations.    We  have formed the conclusion that it would be an advantage if the Act couldbe administered through District Commissioners working  under the control  of theproposed Commissioner  (referred to  in another section of this  report)  who  woulddevote their whole time to the work.  They would be brought in close  touch with employers and workmen and  could  act as  advisers and conciliators,  and  where necessary deal with disputed cases with less  formality and, consequently, less, delay and expense than exist to-day.    But in view of the existing post-war conditions and of the fact that no urgentreasons for a change were pressed upon us, we refrain  from making any definiterecommendation.   It is, nevertheless, a subject that ought to receive attention on some  future occasion and should be considered and reported upon  by the Commis-sioner from time to time.    Whilst adopting this attitude, we are, nevertheless,  of opinion that immediateimprovements are possible in  the existing system.    We recommend that periodical official convocations of the County Court judges and of County Court Registrars should be held at which the administration  of theAct by the Courts should&quot; be discussed and an effort made to bring about uniformityso far as practicable.    Further we recommend that the  County Court Registrars should be appointedto undertake the following duties under the supervision of the Commissioner  :       (i) The Registrars should give information free of expense to injured work-             men or their dependants as to the  benefits  provided  by the Act  and             the  necessary procedure to protect their rights.   In  this  connection
             we think that notices should be permanently posted in a conspicuous             place in all factories, workshops and similar undertakings where work-             men are employed, and  in  ail Post Offices and  Labour  Exchanges,             stating that injured workmen or their dependants can obtain informa-             tion about the Act from the local County Court Registrar.       (ii) If an employer and his injured workman or his dependants are unable             to agree upon the benefits payable, the Registrar, upon request of the             parties, shall act as a mediator between them, and at his discretion             take such steps as he may deem advisable to bring the parties in             agreement.     We further think that, in the event of a  dispute as to the, workman&apos;s condition, the Registrar should be empowered, if both parties assent thereto, at his discretion, to refer the matter to a Medical Referee, whose certificate should be conclusive.     Generally, we recommend that the Registrars should be called upon to undertake the duty of giving information about the benefits and procedure provided for in the Act and also to act  as &quot; Mediators &quot;  between the parties when requested so to do, because we are satisfied from the evidence before us that in a large number of cases the parties could be brought in agreement if the assistance could be invoked of a competent independent intermediary  in whom  both  parties repose confidence, and that much friction, delay and expense could thereby be prevented.     The foregoing recommendations  are  intended for  general application in the United  Kingdom, but wo recognise that some modification  may be necessary for Scotland in  view of the provisions at present in  force there for  assisting  poor litigants through the &quot; Agents for the Poor.&quot;t                              SECTION 3. APPEAL.     From the County Court Judge or Sheriff-Substitute, appeal lies on questions of law to  the Court of  Appeal or Court of Session, and thence to the House of Lords.   On question of fact the arbitrators decision is final.     When the arbitration is before a  single arbitrator or a committee, there can be no review  of their award save by first submitting a  question of law  to  the County Court Judge for his decision.  Thence an appeal lies in  the usual way to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords.   The evidence is that  on the few occasions when this procedure  has been invoked it has been found a most useful provision &quot; because we raise the question in the least expensive manner possible.....We have had one or two important principles to settle  which have formed  a guide for a number of cases, and  ....  the stating of the case was just as much  at the request of the miners as at my request     We do not recommend any change in the existing procedure on appeal.                                  PART X.                          MEDICAL  REFEREES.                 SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS.    Medical Referees are appointed by the Home Secretary for the purposes of the Act (Section 16).  Their appointments are for County Court Circuits (for Sheriff- doms in Scotland and Counties  in Ireland) and in the  majority of cases they are specially attached to certain Courts on the Circuit  to  which they are  appointed. They are part-time officers (even the  busiest of them are not occupied with their duties under the Act for more than a small part of their time)  and they are remu- nerated for their services  in each case by fees paid by the Exchequer in  accordance with  a prescribed scale.  Over 300 Referees have  been appointed for the whole country.    The Referees consist partly of consultants and partly of  general practitioners. They include a certain number of specialist referees appointed for particular classes of cases,  such as cases of industrial disease and ophthalmic cases.    The main qualifications required by the Home Office are that the Referee should be a  man of independent position and  high standing in-the profession,  so that hemay command the confidence of all parties in disputes under the Act and bring into such disputes not only the fact but the reputation of strict impartiality;  and secondly (as a general rule), in view of the fact that the majority of cases arising under the Act are of a surgical nature, that he should have surgical qualifications.and should have obtained through hospital appointments or otherwise a wide experi-ence of accidents and their consequences.               * Cooper 6042-5.      f See Evidence, Hay  Shennan, 21,252-5.
                                   SECTION 2.-DUTIES.94       Besides the duty of deciding appeals in cases of industrial diseases under Section     8  (see paragraph 32)  and the duty of ascertaining, in  cases where the workman     desires to receive his compensation abroad; as to  the permanent nature of the in-     capacity (see Schedule I. (18)), the Referees  have the following duties assigned to     them:              (a) Giving a certificate in cases referred to them through  the  Registrar of                  the County Court on the joint request of employer  and workman,                  as to the condition of the workman and  his  fitness for employment                  or to what extent his incapacity is  due to the accident.  This certi-                  ficate  is  conclusive  evidence  as  to  the  matters   so  certified.                  (Schedule I. (15).)            (&amp;) Sitting with a Judge, when summoned by him, as assessor.   (Schedule II.                    (5).)            (c) Reporting at the request of a Judge, Arbitrator,  or Committee on &quot; any                  matter which seems material to any question  arising in the arbitra-                  tion.&quot;  (Schedule II.  (15).)          The duty  of furnishing  reports  under  Schedule II.  (15)  dates  back to the     original Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of 1897.  The duties under Schedule I.  (15)     and Schedule II. (5) were enacted for the first time in  the Act of 1906 and were     based on recommendations by the  Departmental  Committee on Workmen&apos;s Com-     pensation of  1903, though the provisions of Schedule I. (15) &quot;fall far short of  the     actual recommendations made by  the  Committee.  The Committee  recommended     that in the case of disputes on medical points arising previously to the commenee-     ment of weekly payments, discretion should be given to the Registrar of the County     Court on application by either party  to refer the matter to the Medical Referee,     and that in the case of any such disputes at a subsequent stage, the Registrar should     be required on the application of  either party to  refer the  matter to  the Referee,     whose decision  was in  all cases to be conclusive.95       The following table shows the number of references  to Referees under the pro     visions in each  of the five years 1910-1914, inclusive* : 	mo.	1911.	1912.	1913.	1914.Schedule I (15)......... Schedule II (5)......... Schedule II (15).........	&apos; 496 659 343	521 976 387	519 1,112 267	658 1,044 118	731 1,015 106     It will be seen that there has been a substantial increase in the use made ofthe Medical Referees under Schedule I.  (15) and II. (5), but the extent of their employment varies greatly  in  different  areas.  In some circuits,  for example,  itis the regular practice of the County Court Judge to summon the Medical Refereeto sit with him as assessor  in cases involving medical issues; in other circuits theReferee is rarely or never summoned, even when a request for this purpose is madeby the parties.   Again, in some areas employers and workmen take great advantageof the provisions of Schedule I. (15), whereas in other, and, indeed, in most areas,these provisions are practically a dead letter.    The number of references to Medical Referees under Schedule II. (15). has beendecreasing, but  this, no doubt, is the result of their more frequent employment asassessors,  and, if so, is hardly to be regretted.  A report can only be called for under shedule II. (15) after a conflict of medical evidence has arisen in an arbitration, andthe reference to a Referee at that late stage causes delay and. possibly further expenseto the parties, and may involve a further hearing after the Referee has reported.     SECTION 3. SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING FULLER USE OF SERVICES OF MEDICAL                                   REFEREES.    We consider it of great importance to the satisfactory working of the Act thatthe fullest use should be made of the services of the Medical Referees in any disputeas to the extent and cause of the workman&apos;s incapacity.  It is clear from the statisticsand evidence before us that this is not secured under present conditions.    * During  the War the number of references to  Medical Referees decreased considerably, butthis can be explained by the abnormal conditions.
      (1) The most important point is to secure the determination of medical issues before the case actually comes into Court.  At present this can only be effected under Schedule I, (15)  by an agreement between the parties  to refer the matter to the Medical Referee.  A number of witnesses have advocated that Schedule I. (15) should be amended so as to give either party the right to have the matter referred for final settlement  to  the, Referee.  After consideration we are of opinion that&apos; it will be advisable to extend  Schedule I. (15) to provide that, on an application being made by either party and on payment of the prescribed fee, the Registrar of a County Court may, after  hearing  the parties and subject to a right of appeal from his decision to the Judge,  &quot; refer the matter to a medical referee.&quot;      (2) As regards the employment of  the Referees as medical assessors, we believe that^ the Referees can  and do render valuable service in  this capacity, and, while retaining the present discretion of the Judge to summon a Referee to sit as medical. assessor in  any case in which he thinks fit, we recommend that it should also be open to either party, on  giving security for  the payment of the fees due to the Referee (which should  afterwards be dealt with by the Judge in his discretion as part of the costs of the case), to obtain as of right a summons to the Referee to sit as assessor.      The position of the Referee when sitting as Medical Assessor and his relation to the Judge have been clearly defined by the Courts.  In Lewis v. Port of London Authority (1914) 7  B.W.C.C. 577, Pickford, L.J., observed : &quot; Now,  some point was :&apos; made as to the way in which it was suggested the Judge and the medical assessor &quot; who tried the case discharged their respective functions.   There does not seem to be &quot; any doubt: about the  position of the assessor.  He was  compared,  and rightly, I &quot; think, to a nautical assessor an elder brother in the Admiralty Courts and there &quot; is no doubt about his function.  He is there to give his advice in the one case upon &quot; nautical matters,  and in the other case upon medical matters.   He is not there to &quot; give a judgment or to find the facts, and his advice is no pan of the judgment, and &quot; may be disregarded by the Judge, as it has been in the Admiralty Court on not &quot; very infrequent occasions.&quot;  Again, in Carpenter v. Wandsworth Borough Council (1917) 10&quot; B.W.C.C. 340,  Warrington, L.J.  observed: &quot;  The learned County Court &quot; Judge was in this case assisted by a medical referee.  Now, what is the function of &quot; a medical referee? I think it is quite clear his function is to give the Judge the &quot; benefit: of  his scientific knowledge and medical experience as to the proper conclusion &quot; to  be drawn  from a scientific point of view from the external  facts deposed to  in &quot; evidence : not to weigh the evidence of those facts and then to say that the facts &quot; were otherwise; but accepting the facts to state what in his  view is the proper &quot; inference in  a scientific sense to be drawn from them.  Now, that is exactly what &quot; the referee did in the present case, and no more.   The learned Judge describing the &quot; advice given TO him by the medical man says : &apos; when the medical assessor advised &quot; me that all the symptoms which had been spoken to in that case were practically &quot; consistent with peritonitis, having been set up  through what I might call purely &quot; physical  causes apart  from any accident  or externa^ injury &apos; that is  to say, &quot; accepting the description of the symptoms and the conditions, the medical assessor &quot; expressed his opinion as to what was the proper inference to be drawn from them &quot; from a scientific point of view, and his opinion was that they were consistent either &quot; witfi a blow or some other unknown  natural cause.  In my opinion the learned &quot; County Court Judge  was not bound, but certainly entitled to  accept the view  so &quot; expressed, and haying  accepted it, it is impossible for  us to  interfere with the &quot; conclusion he has come to.&quot;     The function then of the Medical  Referee as Assessor is to advise the Judge from a scientific standpoint as  to what inferences may properly be  drawn on the medical issues  from the facts presented in evidence-and also,  we  presume,  from any facts ascertained by the Referee himself through any personal medical examina- tion  of the  workman, but it is left to the Judge  after weighing the whole facts of the case to decide whether or how far the advice given by the medical  assessor should be accepted.   Several  of the medical  and  other witnesses who  have  given evi- dence before us have suggested that more responsibility should be  thrown on the medical assessor, and that the Judge should be required to accept and act upon his findings in  medical  issues.   We do not regard this as  desirable-the Judge must, we think, continue free to form his own opinion on the whole facts of the case.     It has  been suggested that the Referee should  be  given the right of asking ouestions-through the Judge-of the witnesses, so far as necessary, to elucidate the medical issues,  and should also be given the opportunity, where necessary, of making a  more thorough examination of the workman than is possible in Court or in the Judges room.  We recommend that both these suggestions be adopted.
                    SECTION 4.-STATUS OF MEDICAL REFEREES.      As  stated  above,  Medical  Referees  are  required  to  be  medical  prac-  practitioners  of  high reputation  in   their  profession with  (as  a  rule)  surgical  qualifications  and also to  be  men of  independent  position  who  will  be un-  affected by local pressure or considerations of local practice.    The professional  capacity of the gentleman  chosen for the post of Referee has not been called in  question by anyone.  As regards the independence of the. Referee, little complaint  has been made to us, and we are assured that in selecting the referees, great care is  taken not to appoint any person holding an appointment which would identify him  too closely either with employers or workmen,  or about  whom,  whether from the  nature of  his  practice or otherwise, there  might obtain the &quot;impression that he  favoured or was likely to favour one side or the other.     It appears to us, however, to be  inevitable that so long as the Medical Referees  are allowed to engage in private practice they will be subject to a certain amount  of distrust  and suspicion.   This consideration impressed itself strongly  on the  Departmental  Committee  of 1903, who  advised that the Medical Referee should  be a public official  rather than a medical man in practice.  The practicability of  making this change has been considered on several occasions, but two difficulties  have hitherto stood in  the way.  First, even in the chief industrial areas, there has  not been sufficient  work; under  the  Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act to occupy the  Referee for the whole, or  anything approaching the whole, of his time.  Secondly,  it  has  been feared, and in  our  opinion rightly feared, that it would be difficult for a Referee who devoted the whole of his time to reporting on and deciding  cases under the Act to maintain his efficiency.   Possibly a solution of these difficulties may be found in the suggestion made by Dr. Smith Whitaker, Senior Medical Officer for the Ministry of Health, in answer to questions put to him, that some, if not all, of the whole-time medical officers who are now being appointed by the Ministry under the National Health Insurance Act for different areas, might undertake the work of the Medical Referees under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act as part of their official duties.   Dr. Whitaker explained that the primary duty of these  officers will be to advise in doubtful cases referred  to them either by the Approved Societies or by the panel doctors as to whether the insured person is or is not incapable of work.  They may also have referred to them by an Approved Society cases of prolonged incapacity on. which the Society desires to obtain a second opinion, and may be consulted by the panel doctors on any difficult point of diagnosis or treatment.   The Medical Officers will be  selected from general practitioners of superior qualifications.  &quot; Through- &quot; out the country there are some  general practitioners who are habitually called in &quot; in consultation with  other practitioners, not as specialists but because their col- &quot; leagues have confidence in the general soundness of their judgments and general &quot; experience.  That is  the type of man we are trying to get.&quot;  In cases of excep- tional  difficulty, the Medical  Officers will be empowered to  call in a specialist. This scheme has not yet so  far developed as to  enable us to express any positive opinion on Dr. Whitaker&apos;s suggestion.  It must first be ascertained not only that the new Medical Officers will possess the particular qualifications required for the  pur- poses of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, but also that the duties of two posts will not be likely to clash to any substantial extent.  All we can now suggest is,  that when the new organisation has reached a more  advanced stage, the possibility of combining  the  two services  should  be carefully explored  by the  Departments concerned.                         SECTION 5. MEDICAL BOARDS.    Several witnesses have suggested that Medical Boards or Tribunals should be set up in place  of the Medical Referees, on the ground chiefly that the opinion  of aBoard would carry  more weight.   Other  witnesses, however, have expressed anemphatic opinion against this proposal.  Dr. Smith Whitaker, for instance, statedthat the Ministry of Health, when considering the scheme outlined above, had  also considered the alternative proposal of Medical Boards, but had come to the conclu-sion that it would be much  more costly and not so satisfactory.   We agree with  thisview, and do nob recommend any change.
                                     PART  XI.1                                CONTRACTING OUT.99      By reason of the decision in Griffiths v. Earl Dudley (1882) 9 Q.B.D. 357, which     declared it to be permissible for a workman to undertake, as part of his contract of     service, that he would forego any right to sue for damages for personal injury under     the Employers&apos; Liability Act, 1880, the &quot; contracting-out &quot; controversy became acute     when the first measure for Workmen&apos;s Compensation was under  debate.  The right     to contract out of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1897, was only allowed on con-     dition that the, workman should contract into a &quot; scheme of compensation benefit or     insurance&quot; which had been certified by the Registrar of Friendly  Societies after full     investigation, as being &quot;  on the  whole not less favourable &quot; than the provisions of the     Act.   Power to contract-out was re-enacted in the Act of 1906, but in the latter Act     the condition became one requiring  the scheme  substituted  for  the Act  to be one     providing &quot; scales of compensation not less favourable to the workmen  and their     dependants than the corresponding scales contained in this Act &quot;.  Both  Acts con-     tained conditions that when the substituted scheme provided for contributions by the     workmen it must confer &quot; benefits at least equivalent to those contributions, in addi-     tion to the benefits to. which the workmen would have been entitled under this Act &quot;,     and that a majority of the workmen  (to be ascertained by ballot) were in  favour of     the scheme.         Little use is now made of the power to contract-out. According to the evidence     of the present Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies : &quot; Apart from the  Government     &quot; scheme, there were in 1900, 46 schemes certified under the 1897 Act, with 123,000     &quot; members.  At the next certification in 1904 there were 54 schemes with 117,619     &quot; members.  When the new Act came into force in 1906 a good many of the schemes     &quot; seem to have dropped out; re-certification was not  applied for.  In 1908, after the     &quot; schemes had been re-certified  under the new Act, there were only 32 schemes with     &quot; 65,000 members.   Five  years later, in 1913, when another re-certification took place,     &quot; there were only 23 schemes left with 68,000 members.  At the next re-certification     &quot; in 1918 there only survived 20 schemes with 63,000  members.&quot;*  It is noticeable     that  of these, 6  schemes belong to  the mining industry, an interesting survival     probably of the numerous Miners&apos; Permanent Relief Societies which have  played so     worthy a part in industrial history.  Of the others, one is a railway scheme,  there     are two Corporation schemes, two gas companies, the Government  scheme, four ship-     building companies,  a saltworks and two other manufactories, and one scheme for a     quarry.         The Chief Registrar further expressed the view that unless new attractions for     contracting-out schemes  were provided, he did not anticipate any future increase     in the number of schemes.        In these circumstances the practical question before the Committee is whether     any abuse has been  disclosed which would warrant interference with the existing     provisions.   Such  criticism as was submitted  by Trade  Union  witnesses did not     disclose any real grievance, and the Chief Registrar informed us that he had only     received some half-dozen complaints during a number  of years and that those were     from individual workmen.  He further informed us that it had been found that no     scheme could  continue against  the will of the workmen affected by it.  So soon as     friction arises the experience has been that the scheme comes to an end.   On the     other hand, we were impressed by his  statement that the  success of  the  surviving     schemes was due mainly to the provision for the settlement of claims by  Committees     on which the workmen have representation.   In the  course of the  debate on the first     Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill,t Mr.  Joseph Chamberlain submitted to the House of     Commons three possible advantages of contracting-out schemes:  &quot; Under  a scheme     &quot; it was possible to have greater freedom and variety than under any Act of Parlia-     &quot; ment.  Local and trade conditions could be met as  Parliament could not meet them     &quot; in dealing with the whole of the combined industries of the country.   Secondly, it     &quot; was possible to have arrangements  more favourable to the workmen than any the     &quot; House would dare  to propose  as the minimum to be imposed upon all the  trades of     &quot; the country.  There would  always be exceptional employers who would be willing     &quot; to make larger sacrifices than any which the Legislature imposed as  a matter of     &quot; obligation.  Thirdly and he was not certain that this was not  most important of                  * Stuart Robertson,  23,827,                 t 6th July, 1897,
&quot; all it was desirable that these schemes should be arranged, because he believed&quot; that the best security for the satisfactory administration ofo this law was in the&quot; joint effort of workmen and employers; and he did not believe that the result would&quot; ever be so satisfactory under any  other arrangement.  One great  advantage of&quot; schemes like the miners&apos; relief fund was that they had brought in the workpeople&quot; to join in the administration of the fund and in the supervision of payments, and,&quot; to a certain extent, to make them responsible for the contributions.&quot;  We feel that now it is more desirable than ever that no opportunity should be lost of fostering any scheme which brings employers and workmen together in the joint  management ofaffairs in which both have material concern.    At  the same time,  there are several directions in which the  powers of the cer-tifying authority might be usefully extended.    Under the 1906 Act, the Chief Registrar  of Friendly Societies is  only requiredto see that the scales of compensation of schemes submitted are as good as those ofthe Act. His scrutiny does not extend to the scheme as a whole, nor is  there any duty on him to enquire as to the actual provision made to secure payment of benefits under the scheme.  Control should be extended to cover both these matters.    A more serious defect was disclosed in the case of Haworth v. Andrew Knowles&amp;  Sons, Ltd., 6 B.W.C.C. 596, decided in 1913.   There the scheme had expiredand the funds had become exhausted, and not only the applicant, but a number of widows  and children found themselves without a remedy.   The wrorkmen havingcontracted out, the employers were under no  liability under the Act.  A remedy was indicated in the following passage from the judgment of Swinfen Eady, L.J.: &quot; It&quot; appears to me that the appellant is asking us not to construe but to ignore the  terms&quot; of Section 3 of the Act of 1897.   If  you read the language of that it appears  to me&quot; to be clear.  Now, the employer may contract:  &apos; That the provisions of the scheme&quot; shall be substituted for the provisions of this Act, and thereupon the employer shall&quot; be liable only in accordance with the scheme.&apos;  It will be observed that the liability&quot; under the Act is not to be in addition to the liability under the scheme; the two are&quot; not  co-existent;  the one is substituted for the other.  What the appellant asks us&quot; to do is to read this provision as if there were incorporated with it some such pro-&quot; vision as this :&apos;  The employer shall be liable only in accordance with the scheme &apos; &quot; then, I think, it is something like this-&apos; so far as regards sums which have actually&quot; accrued payable to injured workmen while the scheme was in force.   He shall also&quot; be liable under the Act for sums subsequently accruing payable in respect of acci-&quot; dents happening while the scheme is in force.&apos;   That is what he asks us to do, but41 in my opinion that is quite contrary to the very clear language in this provision :&quot; that the employer shall be liable only in accordance with the scheme, and the one&quot; liability shall be substituted for the other.&quot;    We  accordingly  recommend that provisions  for contracting-out of the Work-men&apos;s Compensation  Act should be continued subject to the safeguards  containedin Section 3 of the Act of 1906 and to  the further  conditions that it should be theduty of the certifying authority to consider whether a  scheme  as  a  whole  is  notless&quot; favourable to the workman and his dependants than the provisions of the Act,and to satisfy himself that  adequate provision, is made to secure the payment ofthe benefits  under the scheme.  We are further of opinion that  it should be acondition of all schemes that the employer shall guarantee benefits thereunder bothduring the currency of the scheme and after its expiry.    Furthermore, in our view  it is desirable  that the  certification  of contracting-out schemes should be in the hands of the proposed Commissioner.   That the  ChiefRegistrar of Friendly Societies has ably discharged the duties imposed  upon himby the Workmen^ Compensation Act is not questioned, but it would  be anomalousto continue this particular duty in the hands of an authority other than that chargedwith the various other duties under the same Act.                                      PART  XII.              PROVISIONS  AS  TO  BANKRUPTCY  OF  EMPLOYER.100      The relevant provisions under the present Statute are contained in Section 5.      Sub-sections (1) and (2) meet the case of bankrupt employers who have insured, and      enable the workman, as against the insurance company, to step into the shoes of      the employer.
          Sub-sections  (3) and (4) meet the case of bankrupt employers  who have not      insured, and give priority to compensation up to  100 in the distribution of assets.(9        The suggestion was made  to us  that the uninsured bankrupt  should not be      allowed to receive his discharge until the workman&apos;s  claim for compensation was      settled in full.  We do not deem it advisable, in the interests of the State, to impose      this penalty upon a bankrupt employer.          On a different footing was the proposal to extend priority to the full amount      of the compensation due, instead of leaving the workman to take his chance with      the unsecured creditors for the excess over  100 of his claim.          We are in favour of this proposal and recommend that the amount of compensa-      tion to which priority may be given in the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt      employer be fixed at the full amount of the claim.                                      PART XIII.                             ACCIDENT PREVENTION.101       To its earliest advocates Employers&apos; Liability was rather a means of securing      greater protection for the workman&apos;s life and limb than of providing compensation      for those injured by industrial accident.   The idea was that if accidents could be      made costly to the employer he would thereby be induced to  take steps to avoid      them.   Thus,  so far back as 1846, the Select Committee on Railway Labourers,^      shocked by the casualties among the 200,000 navvies engaged on the work of railway      construction, reported in favour of making the railway companies pay compensation      for accidents.  &quot; By making the Companies liable instead, your Committee contem-      &quot; plates fixing that part with the liability who has the greatest power to prevent the      &quot; injury and the greatest means to repair it.&quot;  Again, &quot; At the Trade Union Con-      &quot; gress  of 1877  universal provision  for all industrial accidents, the funds to  be      &quot; provided by  a  tax on commodities, was suggested by  a London compositor as  an      &quot; alternative to  the usual employers&apos; liability resolution.  It was vehemently de-      &quot; nounced by Thomas Halliday, a leader of the coalminers, who said &apos; they wanted no      &quot; tax upon coal.   What they wanted was that their lives and their bodies should be      &quot; preserved.   The best way to secure this was to make the employers responsible,      &quot; and make them pay the cost.   What they wanted was not money, but their lives      &quot; and limbs preserved.&apos;  This view  was endorsed by Alexander Macdonald and      &quot; accepted by the Congress amid loud cheers.&quot;t  Even as recently as 1893 the Home      Secretary, when  moving the Second Reading of  the  Employers&apos; Liability Bill      already referred to, found a  weapon in the  old Trade Union doctrine with which      to attack Mr.  Chamberlain&apos;s amendment favouring a general compensation scheme.      &quot; It is  obvious  that  if  the  employer is to  be made  liable to  workmen for all      &quot; injuries sustained in the course of their employment, whether due to neglect of the      &quot; employer or  any other cause, he must protect himself  by insurance, and  that it is      &quot; only by a system of universal industrial insurance that such a  proposal could  he      &quot; made consistent with justice  ....  I must point out  ...  .  that while      &quot; a general system of insurance against accidents of all kinds has a  great many things      &quot; to recommend  it, yet it has this  great drawback; that it affords no security and      &quot; no incentive  for the exercise of  care on the part of the employer.  A system  of      &quot; industrial insurance, unless it is supplemented and safeguarded by an ancillary law,      &quot; making the employer liable I do not say whether by criminal or civil proceedings-      &quot; for accidents due to his own  negligence,  would be rather a retrograde than a      &quot; progressive measure.&quot;   (Hansard, 1893, Vol. 8, col. 1956.)         The plan  by which, accidents were to be prevented by being made costly was      defeated, at any rate for the time  being, by the growth  of accident insurance, the     effect of which was that the  liability imposed on the individual employer was  no     lonerer seriously felt, and the provision of some measure of support for the injured     workman  and  his dependants was  looked upon as the sole proper function of the     EmDlovers&apos; Liability Act.  The  perfection and enforcement of the body of law  to     which belong the Factory and Workshop Act and the various Mines Regulations Acts     came to be regarded as the exclusive means by which greater safety for life and limb     was to be achieved.                   * Select Committee on Eailway Labourers, 1846, XIII., p. 427.                            t Webb&apos;s Industrial Democracy, p. 382.        29358                                                                    F

That does&quot; not touch my equal conviction that you should maintain and preserve and, if neces-&quot; sary, extend and render more stringent all those provisions of the law which  are&quot; necessary to make the employer properly careful in all matters that are within his&quot; proper obligations.&quot;  . (Hansard, 1893, Vol. 8, col. 1965.)     Recent experience  in America has brought about a revival of interest in  theidea that the branch of  legislation to which belong Employers&apos; Liability and Work-men&apos;s Compensation Acts can be  made the means  of encouraging  measures  foraccident prevention.     Regard must, however, be had to the essential contrast in the history of industriallegislation in the two countries.     In our own country a responsible public Department  has, since the middle ofthe nineteenth century, been gradually working out a  special code of laws providingfor safety in factory and mine,  and the administration of that code has been,  andremains, entirely in the hands of responsible officials of the Central  Government.In the United States of America each State determines for itself whether  it shallhave safety laws at all, and, if so,  what form they shall take.   &quot; For a number of&quot; years prior to the enactment of the first compensation laws in 1911, a Considerable&quot; amount of safety legislation had been on the statute books of many of the more&quot; advanced industrial States, but the extent and effectiveness of these laws as regards&quot; accident prevention were unsatisfactory.  The methods of prevention were prac-&quot; tically limited to the  mechanical guarding of danger  points.&quot;*  The coming of workmen&apos;s Compensation Legislation in 1911,  however, gave a  new impetus to  themovement for accident prevention in America.    An Insurance Company doingbusiness in Great Britain finds the risk of accident kept within reasonable limits bythe Factory and Workshop Act and Mines Regulation Acts.  In America they hadto build up their  own accident prevention  organisation.   Thus, &quot; To Chairman&quot; W. G.  Cowles, of the Associated Companies, is largely due the credit for bringing&quot; together 10 of the strongest stock casualty insurance  companies for the organisation&quot; of a department of inspection and safety for the insurance and protection of  coal&quot; mines.  With far-seeing vision, born of a knowledge of the splendid results achieved&quot; in the prevention of accidents in other industries through the safety engineering&quot; departments of the several member companies constituting the Associated Com-&quot; panies, these felt that they could safely undertake the insurance of mine operators&quot; against their workmen&apos;s compensation obligations, providing they could develop a&quot; system of inspection to determine the safety condition of each mine insured and the&quot; premium rate which it should bear according to the hazard revealed by such inspec-.&quot; tion. supplemented above all by a safety engineering service which  should devote&quot; itself to the improvement of the safety condition of each mine, coupled with  the&quot; financial incentive of a reduction in insurance rate for every improvement made in&quot; the safety condition.&quot;f  When it is remembered that Standardisation committees of the national safety organisations, the engineering societies, the State and federal authorities and, the Accident  Insurance Companies  have  all taken &quot;a hand in  thework,  it is easy to  understand the plea advanced so recently as 1918 that &quot; a serious&quot; effort for uniformity should be made without further delay.  In addition to all  the&quot; various State standards, there are already several different standards of a national.&quot; character, such as the standards of the schedule-rating committees of the Federal&quot; Safety Engineers, the United States Compensation Board, and (on certain subjects)&quot; the American Society Of Mechanical Engineers. A movement for uniformity might&quot; well be started&quot;!     &quot; Merit rating &quot; is  the means by which Workmen&apos;s Compensation Statutes havebeen made to advance the accident prevention movement in America.  It involvesrecognition of the principles that the employer who takes all reasonable steps to safe-guard his  employees should pay less for accident insurance than the employer who
       is indifferent to such matters, and that the employer who is disposed to spend money       on accident prevention appliances should not be discouraged by the knowledge thatjl     his competitor who spends nothing would pay the same rate of premium.W        ^  &quot; Merit rating  &quot;  may  be either  &quot; experience rating &quot; or &quot; schedule rating.&quot;       &quot; Experience rating &quot; has been defined  as  &quot; an attempt to modify the rate of the       individual plant in accordance with  its.accident  experience.&quot;*   For example, if       an employers basic rate is  1  dollar,  and the compensation costs of his accidents       resulting in &quot;temporary total disability, temporary  partial disability and permanent       partial disability do not exceed a ratio of 400 dollars per 100,000 dollars of pay roll,       and  he has had no fatal or permanent  total disability cases, he qualifies for the basic       rate  of 1 dollar.   A charge of 3 per cent,  is made against the  basic rate, for every       40 dollars by which the compensation cost of temporary total, temporary partial and       permanent  partial disability  cases exceeds the ratio of 400  dollars per  100,000       dollars of pay roll.  So if the ratio were 600 dollars, the rate would be 1.15 dollars.       If there are fatal and permanent total disability cases,  further adjustments  are       made.t104        &quot; Schedule rating &quot; is &quot; an attempt to modify the rate of the individual plant in       accordance with its physical condition  as determined by inspection.&quot;  It &quot; takes into       &quot; consideration  the  accident hazards  presented by the buildings, equipment, and       &quot; operations of each plant, giving charges for certain conditions that have been shown       &quot; by practical experience to produce  accidents, or credits for conditions that  are       &quot;known to be  superior from the accident  prevention  standpoint.&apos;^   Charges       according to a schedule are added to  the basic rate  for such defects as absence of       guards to machinery or want of proper handrails to stairs, and, on the other hand,       credits are given in respect of such matters as the presence of an emergency hospital,       good light, sanitation and inspection service. 105        A system which makes use of Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts so as to provide a       definite pecuniary advantage in return for the elimination of accident risks  has       obvious claims to consideration.  We have accordingly tried to  determine whether a       system which has grown up in the conditions which have been briefly indicated above       can be advantageously introduced into a country possessing a highly developed and       long  standing code of safety legislation which has come into being without any refer-       ence  to Workmen&apos;s Compensation Statutes at all.           Hitherto the Workmen&apos;s Compensation  Acts of our own country have included       no provision designed to encourage accident prevention, $           By their system of &quot; special rating &quot;, Insurance Companies in respect of large       risks paying, say,  10,000 a year in wages, reduce rates where the experience of two       or three years shows  &quot; few accidents as a result of good management, good plant and       all that.&quot;1f  Reduction of premium follows experience alone.   There is no system-       matic inspection; the existence of a safety or welfare committee is not a factor; and       no reduction of premium is offered on  the ground that safety precautions  are taken.106        The only form of &quot; merit rating  &quot; hitherto practised in this country appears       accordingly to be a form of &quot; experience rating &quot; which is  open to the criticism that       its benefits are extended to the larger employers only and that the smaller employer is       not invited  to participate therein; that a  single  serious accident,  for  which  the       employer may be in no way to blame, may involve a serious penalty; and that a good       experience  may result not from the provision by the employer of safety conditions,       but from other causes, the exercise of greater care by the workmen themselves for       example.           The  system  of schedule rating is  specially appropriate to  factories  and work-       shops, and in order to ascertain how far the system might be desirable and practicable       in this country, we invited the views of the Factory Department of the Home Office       on the subject.   Mr. Gerald Bellhouse, C.B.E., one of the Deputy Chief Inspectors       of Factories, who gave evidence, expressed himself strongly in  favour  of  the intro-       duction of some system of schedule rating.   He suggested that a central body should          *  Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics ;  whole number 212, p. 249.          t  Bulletin of the United States Bureau of  Labor Statistics;  whole number 210, p. 60.          X  Bulletin of the United States Bureau of  Labor Statistics; whole number 212, p. 250.          $  The only reference to the subject is that contained in Section 1 (5) of the 1906 Act.  &quot; Nothing       in this Act shall affect any proceeding for a fine under the enactments  relating to mines, factories, or       workshops, or the application of any such fine.&quot; See Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, s. 136 ; Coal       Mines Regulation Act, 1887, s. 70 ;  Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act, 1892, s. 38, providing that the       whole or any part of a fine imposed for breach of provisions or regulations under these  Acts may be       applied for the benefit of any person suffering injury as a consequence of such breach.          f  Gray, 17,565,         29358                                                                      P %
be set up which would be under the control of the State, but on which insurance companies would be represented, with power to fix standards for different trades,compliance with which would entitle the factory occupier to obtain a specified credit.When the standards were being fixed for any particular industry, representativesof that  industry should be appointed or  co-opted to the central body, and factoryinspectors with special knowledge  of the subject should be called in to assist.It  should  be  the  duty of  the Insurance  Companies to allow  the credit  inevery  case  in  which  they  were  satisfied  that   the employer   had  reachedthese standards, and any  employer  aggrieved by the  refusal of  a company  togrant the credit should have the right to  appeal to some independent tribunal.   Solong as  standards were fixed in consultation with  the Factory Department and. theindustry and were of a definite character,  Mr. Bellhouse did not anticipate that anyserious  divergence would arise  between the administration of this system  and the enforcement of the Factory Acts.    We consider that a practical scheme of schedule rating would be of considerablevalue in the prevention of accidents and are glad, to report that the Accident OfficesAssociation* have agreed to co-operate in a scheme of this character.  We recommendthat power should be given to the proposed Commissioner to institute inquiries and,by agreement with the Insurance Companies and Mutual Associations, to prescribe apractical scheme for schedule rating.                                      PART  XIV.                     DUTIES OF  PROPOSED COMMISSIONER.107      We have already recommended (see paragraph 26) the appointment of a Govern-      ment Officer under the designation of Commissioner for the purpose of the super-      vision of insurance companies, mutual associations and self-insurers as recommended      in Part II. of this Report.  We are of opinion that it would conduce to efficiency of      administration and be a convenience to all concerned if, in addition to these duties,      the proposed Commissioner was entrusted so far as practicable, subject always to the      directions of the responsible Minister, with all the  duties in  relation  to workmen&apos;s      compensation which are at present performed, or would under the proposals in this      Report fall to be performed, by any Government Department, and so became  the      recognised central authority in the administration of workmen&apos;s compensation.          The most important of the duties at present fulfilled by the State are those dis-      charged by the Home Office in respect of the following matters : (a) the appointment      and regulation of the duties of Medical Referees, (b)  the scheduling of new industrial      diseases, (c) the  regulation of the duties of the Certifying and other appointed Sur-      geons in cases of industrial disease, (d) the collection of returns as to compensation      from employers, (e) the making of orders conferring supplementary powers on Com-      mittees representative of employers and workmen which have power to settle disputes      under  the  Act,  (f) the  making of Schemes  under  the  Workmen&apos;s  Compensa-      tion (Silicosis) Act, 1918, and (g) making and giving effect to arrangements under      the Disabled Men (Facilities for Employment) Act of 1919.  Other existing powers      which could conveniently be vested in the Commissioner are the powers of the Chief      Registrar  of Friendly Societies as to the certification of contracting-out Schemes      under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906, and the powers of the Board of Trade      under the Assurance Companies  Act, 1909, in respect of the examination and investi-      gation of the accounts of insurance companies so  far  as regards their workmen&apos;s      compensation business.          The new duties proposed in our Report which we recommend should be under-      taken by the Commissioner include the, following: (a) supervising the work of  the      County Court Registrars as mentioned in  paragraph 91,  (b) development of scheme      of medical and  surgical treatment  as suggested  in  paragraph!  75,  (c)  further      investigation of the Question of  training disabled men  (paragraph 77), (d)  further      inquirv into the possibility of establishing a  disability  schedule (paragraph 67), (e)      control and distribution of the Fund for the payment of weekly allowances to depen-      dent children (paragraph 58), (/) dealing with proposals for extension of the Act to      herring and other share fishermen not included in the Act (paragraph 46),  and  (g)      the working out of a scheme of schedule rating (paragraph 106).                   * See Clause (9) of the working arrangement referred to on page 83.
    The Commissioner should also undertake the collection of comprehensive returnsas to compensation, and for this purpose should be enabled to call for returns fromall  employers, insurance companies and mutual associations, and should prepare an annual Report which should be presented  to Parliament giving a resume&quot;  of thedevelopment of workmen&apos;s compensation during the year in other countries, and alsocontaining recommendations for the amendment of the Act or for improvements inits working.    In our opinion the extra cost to the Department in which the proposed Commis-sioner and the staff working under him would be employed should  not exceed  at the outside the sum of  30,000 a year (excepting  the expenses of the administration ofthe fund for children&apos;s allowances), and we consider that this cost should be defrayedby the Treasury, but we recognise that cogent reasons can be urged to the effect thatas the additional expense is incurred for the benefit of workmen and employers, andwill lead to a large saving to employers which will far exceed  any  possible expendi-ture, it should be directly borne by Industry.   If it be deemed advisable that the cost should be provided by Industry, we see no difficulty in raising the money from  insur-ance companies, mutual associations and self-insurers by means of a levy based in thecase of  insurance companies  and mutual associations upon  the  wage roll  of theemployers insured by them, and in the case of self-insurers on their individual wageroll. In fact, an annual levy of l-400th per cent, of such wage roll would, we antici-pate, produce a sum exceeding  30,000.                                 PART XV.           RETROSPECTIVE  APPLICATION  OF BENEFITS.     We have considered whether it would be practicable to grant some form of reviewof weekly payments fixed by agreement or order before the date of the new Act,which would enable the injured workman to obtain the advantage of the proposed en-hanced benefits.  We appreciate that it would be of great assistance to the workman ifthis could be done.  After making full enquiries of the representatives of insurance companies, mutual associations and self-insurers, we are forced to, the conclusionthat it is impracticable to make the power of review retrospective.  The insurance companies inform us that it is impossible to entertain the suggestion, inasmuch asthey only receive premiums to cover the then existing risks, and have no powerto obtain any further premiums from employers for the proposed increases. Further,it has been pointed out that if those at present receiving weekly payments are tohave the  advantage of  the  new benefits, there is no  logical  reason why the workman  who has accepted  a lump sum  settlement, and is  still incapacitated,should  not  be  entitled  to  a similar  review.   In  the  event of   the lattersuggestion being entertained, it  would mean the  re-opening  of  many hundreds of thousands of agreements which have been made in which the insurance com-panies,  mutual associations and self-insurers  have  closed their accounts.    Thereis no doubt that any question of a retrospective review raises difficulties which are practically insurmountable, and we are unable to recommend its adoption.     The foregoing recommendation applies also) to  all cases where liability has arisen but no agreement or order has been obtained before the commencement of thenew Act.    Any workmen totally incapacitated who may at the commencement of the newAct be receiving an additional weekly sum under the provisions of the Workmen&apos;compensation (War Addition) Acts  would,  in accordance with  the foregoingprinciple,  continue to be treated under the existing Workmen&apos;s Compensation act of 1906 (or the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of 1897), but we would recommendthat provision should be  made in  the new Act,  by  agreement with employers and insurance companies, to  enable these workmen, so long as  they remain totallyincapacitated, to continue to receive the additional weekly sum paid to them underthe War Addition Acts.    Any power of redemption contained  in the  new Act should, in our view, also apply to the weekly sums  under the War Addition Acts.
PART XVI.              SUMMARY  OF  MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS.    We attach a summary of our main recommendations                            SYSTEM OE INSURANCE.    The present system to continue, subject to the following modifications :     State supervision of rates of premium of insurance companies with a view to therestriction of their expenses and profits in workmen&apos;s compensation business.   Theadoption of a working arrangement agreed  with the insurance companies by which not more than 30 per cent, of the premium income  is to be expended in profits,management expenses and commission.   The  maximum rates of premium  to be approved or fixed by a Government official who is, for  convenience, referred to in theReport as the proposed Commissioner.  (Paragraphs 22 and 23.)    Mutual Associations to be placed under the same obligations as insurance com-panies as to setting aside funds to meet outstanding liabilities, and with respect tofurnishing returns and information. (Paragraph 24.)    Every  employer other than the Crown,  a local or other public  authority, a statutory company, or a householder in respect of servants not employed by him forthe purpose of his trade  or business, to be required to insure  against workmen&apos;compensation risk.   Employers  with  an annual wage roll averaging more than 20,000 over a period of three years to be entitled to claim exception from compulsory insurance upon compliance with prescribed conditions.  (Paragraph 25.)                    INJURIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ACT.    The phrase &quot; accident arising out of and in the course  of the employment &quot; toremain unaltered.  (Paragraph 29.)                            INDUSTRIAL DISEASES.    Section 8 of the Act to continue to be limited to diseases specific to the employ-ment.  (Paragraph 31.)    The Act to be amended  so as to enable employer and  workman  to enter intoa binding agreement as to payment of compensation for a scheduled disease withouta certificate from the  certifying surgeon.   (Paragraph 33.)

MEMORANDUM BY MR.  REGINALD GUTHRIE.    1.   &quot;Whilst in full accord with  most of the conclusions contained in theReport of the Committee, I regret to find myself unable to concur with the pro-posals therein  in connection with one of  the  most important  matters  which formed the subject of our Enquiry and with two other questions  of minor con-sequence.  Entirely agreeing with  the other members of the Committee  in thedesire to do everything possible  to meet the position  of  those who suffer fromthe effects of industrial accidents,  yet, in the consideration of this important question, I find it is impossible to ignore the economical  effects  of the adoptionof any conclusions which may be  arrived at, and am only able to sign the Reportsubject to the following reservations :                                 BENEFITS.                             Non-fatal Cases.    2.   As stated in the Report,  Lord Brampton,  in describing what was sought to be attained by the first Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, said that its object wasto confer upon the sufferers  &quot; a  right to claim compensation to  a moderate and limited amount in respect of the loss of such wages as they were incapacitatedfrom earning in consequence of  accidental injury, upon  the mere proof  of the accident and its resulting loss, irrespective of its cause.&quot;    The Act removed much of  the  burden of proof  previously  resting  on aninjured person, and most of the  defences which had previously been open to the employer, and rendered him liable to payment  of  compensation in respect of accidents  which were in no way due to his default but  might even have been caused by the workman&apos;s own negligence.    In making  this alteration  in theposition of employers and workmen,  Parliament  decided that the  pecuniary lossshould be shared between them in equal proportions, and to meet the condition that the employers&apos;  liability should  be &quot; moderate and  limited,&quot; a maximumwas fixed at what  was deemed  a  reasonable figure in the circumstances then existing.   The principle of an equal division of the pecuniary  loss between the employer and the workman, which was deliberately adopted in  the first Act of 1897 and continued in that of 1906, after full consideration and discussion, is equitable;and while representatives of the workmen, in giving  evidence before the Com-mittee, expressed their desire for a largely increased proportion, some proposingpayment of full wages, and in certain cases further benefits beyond that, theyplaced before the Committee no evidence in support of such a departure fromthe principles  embodied in the existing Act.  The principle of payment of half-wages  is  recognised in most of the British Dominions and in  many foreigncountries.  It  is true that higher proportions are granted  in some other cases,but in a considerable number of instances,  both  where 50  per  cent, is allowedand also where larger proportions are provided, a limitation has been  placedon the duration of the payment or on the total amount of  the liability.    The Report suggests that the employer is not bearing his full proportionof the loss because the workmen are subject to extra payments for medical attend-ance.   It is, however, to be borne in  mind that in many cases medical assistance and comforts are in fact provided by the employer, and further arrangements are suggested in the Report, while  in all cases he is subject to loss of productionconsequent upon  the disability  of the workman, and this inevitably leads  to increased cost  in the working of  his establishment.    A very serious  effect is to  be anticipated from  increasing the proportionof the wage payable during disability and providing a high maximum rate.The general body of workmen earnestly  desire to resume their full activity  assoon as possible after accidents, and they return to their work  as soon as theirphysical  condition  permits.    It must,  however,  be admitted that there areamongst workmen,  as amongst other classes, persons who are willing to remainoff longer than is necessary if financial encouragement is  given to them to do so.In such cases  payments of compensation, representing such a large proportionof the actual wage  as two-thirds, would provide  an inducement to postpone the resumption  of work beyond the time of  actual  disability.    This would resultnot only in hardship to the employer by the continuance of  payment by him beyondthe time of actual  disability, but  also lead to a diminution in the productivecapacity of the country.  At any time this results in damage to the Nation, but
at present when increased production is so essential to the recovery of the country from the effects of the War, any lessening of the power of the industries to pro-duce to their fullest extent would be most serious.    The existence of the danger is shown in the evidence of Mr. Cooper, referredto in the Report, regarding the effect of the provision in the Act of 1906 grantingpayment for the first week if  disability should  extend over a  fortnight.   Thedanger was admitted by certain of the workmen&apos;s representatives in their evidence before  the Committee, * and the effect of large payments in prolonging the periodof abstention from work or delaying the commencement of light work by partiallydisabled  workmen is referred to by Mr. Registrar Lowet and Judge Sir EdwardBray4    At the time  of the 1897 and  1906 Acts,  when the rate of compensation incases of  disability through accidents was fixed at one-half of the weekly wage,it was  recognised that this should be subject to  a  reasonable maximum, and thefigure adopted was one-half of  what was at that time recognised as a good wage^namely,  2 per week. The wage position is now materially altered.   Instead of 2 per week being looked upon as  a good wage, men in similar positions to thosewho were previously earning that sum are now  earning  4 10s. to  5 per week or more.  The present wage  position,  however,  is brought about  by unusualconditions, and it would not appear to be right to fix a maximum rate based upon such exceptional circumstances when they may only  continue for a short  period,unless  at the same time provision  were made  for a periodical alteration to meetvarying conditions.   It is not,  however,  advisable to adopt a system under whicha maximum might be subject to frequent alterations, and, therefore, it is desir-able that it should be based upon somewhat less than the wage referred to above,it being  always open to Parliament to amend the Act in future if it should befound necessary to do so.    For  the reasons stated, I recommend that  the weekly compensation should be,as in the present  Act, at a rate not exceeding one-half of the weekly wages, andthat the  maximum should be raised to 455. per  week.   This is 10s. per week inexcess of the figure which, by agreement between the Government and representa-tives of  the workmen and  employers  in certain industries, was adopted  in  theWorkmen&apos;s Compensation (War Addition) Amendment Act of 1919 as a temporarily-ary measure to meet the exceptional conditions prevailing at the time, and which still continue.                                Fatal Cases.    3.    With  respect to benefits in fatal cases, I am in complete agreement withthe proposal for  the adoption of a scheme to provide lump sum payments  for widows, and by a pooling arrangement to make provision for payment of weeklyallowances for Children,  and  I accept the figures  set out in  tne  report underthis head.                           Settlement of Claims.    4.   While agreeing that in most cases agreements for settlement of claims bylump sums should be submitted to the Registrar  or Committee for approval, itis not  desirable that this should extend to Agreements in settlement of doubtfulcases where no payment has been made, and where the liability for any paymentunder  the Act is  disputed.  It is an unwarrantable  interference with the liberty of the  workman and employer  alike to prohibit them from compromising doubtfulclaims without submitting particulars to the  authorities and obtaining sanction.In many of these cases settlements are made  with the object of  avoiding  thenecessity of going  to Court,  with the consequent risk and heavy cost.  the remedy proposed would necessarily entail the parties becoming involved in legal proceedings.   As many of such settlements arise  out of cases where it is highlyimprobable that the workman would  succeed, the effect would be that he wouldbe placed in a position  inferior  to that which he now occupies and different from that of any ordinary litigant.                         Discontinuance of Payment.     5.   I also find myself unable to  agree with the proposal that the employershould in all disability cases be compelled to  continue payment even although hemay, from his own  knowledge and from medical advice, be fully  satisfied thathis liability to make such payment is at an end, the Act being intended  only toOrinion, 4168 ; Wilson, 4255.t Q. 9213 (3).% Q. 15,015.
provide for payment during the continuance of incapacity.  In such cases all pos-sible steps should be taken as suggested in the Report to provide for a rapid deter-mination of the question whether disability continues or not, but in the  case ofa disputed  claim it is inequitable that the employer should be compelled  to con-tinue the payment until this dispute is settled.  In the event of it being found thatthe employer is wrong, the workman in all cases recovers the amount which hasbeen withheld, but if  the employer is able to prove that  his liability had ceasedat the time he stopped the payment there is no  possibility of his recovering theamount which, under  the conditions suggested, he would have been compelled topay, although under the Act he was no longer liable.                                                REGINALD GUTHRIE.             MEMORANDUM BY MR. W. R. L. TRICKETT.                           Compulsory Insurance.    1.  I regret that I am unable to subscribe to the recommendations in favour of compulsory insurance and the creation of a &quot; Commissioner^ &quot; Department, setout in Part II of the above Report (Paragraphs 21-26.)  I venture to make this reservation on two main grounds, namely that no case for compulsory  insuranceis made out on the evidence which has been adduced before  the Committee, and,secondly,  that it  is undesirable to  institute a Department  of the nature,  andvested with the powers and duties, indicated by the Majority.    Compulsory insurance cannot be regarded in the abstract.  It is conceded thatcompulsion must be accompanied by some form of &quot;State control  or supervision.The merits of compulsion have to be weighed in conjunction with the necessary measures to secure obedience to the law, and the proposal for State supervision of the affairs of the Insurance  Companies, with which the bulk of employers willbe obliged to insure.    2.  Compulsory insurance was generally advocated by the witnesses represent-ing the workers as an integral part of a comprehensive State scheme of insurance.For a like reason compulsion was opposed by the witnesses who gave evidence onbehalf of the employers.  The introduction of compulsion in the form the Majorityrecommend, may be found to be the prelude to a national scheme of state insur-ance.  which they reject.    The Report suggests that upon the evidence adduced compulsion is necessaryin itself, in order to  prevent the mischief of loss of  benefits to  a workman by-reason of his employer&apos;s insolvency.  The finding that this mischief is so extensiveas to  call for compulsory insurance is substantially  against the weight  of theevidence.  The concrete instances referred! to in the Report are three in number cited  by one witness.  The great body of the witnesses mentioned  no specific caseof loss of  benefits at all.  The evidence of the remaining witnesses may, for themost  part, be summarised by reference to the evidence given by Mr. W. E. Grayand Mr. Arthur Worley on behalf of the Accident Offices Association, comprising48 of  the leading Insurance Companies.    Mr. Gray stated that  &quot; The number of employers  who are uninsured for&quot; Workmen&apos;s Compensation and who are unable to meet their liabilities to their&quot; workmen is negligible.&quot;*  Representatives from the  Sailors&apos;  and Fireraen&apos;union and the Scottish  Trades Union Congress, Mr. Sexton,  M.P.,  and Mr.Stuart Bunning,t  stated that  they  had no personal knowledge of any cases of failure.  In the trades in which cases of failure might be expected to  be  found,if anywhere,  such as the Agricultural and Building trades,  the evidence  of Mr.H. R. Lovell, of the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union, and of Mr. F. L.  Dove, thePresident of the Building Trades&apos; Federation, is to be observed.  Mr. Lovell saidthat  some farmers were not insured,  but they invariably  paid;  and that asregards payment of compensation, his  Union had not met  with  any difficulty.]:Mr. Dove  said he knew of no. case of failure, and that at a Conference between representatives  of  employers and employees no one could,  with  one exception,give  any  such instance. \   Mr. A. L. Lowe, the  President of the Associationof County Court  Registrars, said he knew  of only three cases  throughout thewhole time the Act  had been in operation.il  Judge Fossett Lock stated  that* Gray, 17,564.      t Henson, McVey, 2,379 ; Sexton, 3,889 ; Bunninp, 1,199.   % Lovell, 15,349.         f Dove, 17,463,          1 Lowe, 9,193,
  he only knew of a very few cases over a very wide experience^  he gave one  concrete instance.  Mr. A. C. Baird,t Secretary to the Friendly and Approved  Societies&apos; Conference (Scotland), said that there were not many cases, but he had  known one or two.  Sir Thos. Neill, J.P., Chairman of the National Amalgamated  Approved Society, stated that he had observed three cases out of 25,000, and then  it was not clear that these were cases of failure, as no proceedings were taken  against the employers.]:      On a  general survey of  the evidence, it appears  to me to  be  against the  weight of it, to recommend that a measure of compulsion (having in mind what  compulsion entails) is called for.  As a cure for so small an evil as is shown to  exist, the expensive and  elaborate remedy proposed is quite out of  relation.      The increase in benefits  proposed will  not, I think, enhance the risk dis-  proportionately to the general increase which has taken place in the liabilities  of the community; and I see no reason for apprehending an extensive  failure on  the part of employers in the future to meet obligations which have  not been  appreciably neglected in  the past.     3.  Compulsion cannot be imposed, unless the State is prepared to see  that  the law is obeyed.  If, through lack of vigilance, moreover, an employer became  liable in respect of a risk he had failed to cover and  found himself  unable to  face,  it  is  possible  the  State  would  be  called upon to  assume  financial  responsibility.     The difficulty and expense  of  securing compliance with any  compulsory provisions are  objections so weighty that  the Report recommends the exemption of large classes of the community, namely, employers of domestic servants  and employers whose financial stability may be presumed.   By the absolute exclusion of a large body of employers, the Report, whilst  reducing the cost of administra- tion. fails in its aim to obtain universal security  to the workman, and invalidates such argument as may be founded on the number of employers, amounting, it is said, to a quarter of a million,  who are unprotected by insurance.  Exemption of local or  other public authorities is sound; exemption of an employer whose annual wage roll exceeds   20,000 is based on a  presumption of security.     4.   It  is  open to  objection  to  collect by  compulsory levy the  income of Insurance Companies,  which are private commercial  concerns  trading for a profit.  This objection  may be lessened, but is  not, in  my opinion,  removed by making provision for the limitation of profits.     5.  In  regard  to  the Arrangement with the Accident Offices Association, set out in Appendix A : This Arrangement, which is recommended for statutory confirmation, provides for a deduction of 30 per cent, (reducible in certain events in the future by 1  per cent., 2 per cent,  or  2J  per cent.) from the Companies&apos; gross premium income, to meet administrative expenses and  profit.  This gross income may conceivably in future years increase to  10,000,000 a year; and in these circumstances I am not satisfied that the proposed deduction will be found to be a reasonable minimum.     In the  interest, moreover, of the industry or the  community generally, on whom will  fall the gross cost of  accident  insurance,  I cannot think that  the economical  administration of the  Act would be adequately  secured under  the terms  of  the Arrangement.   The  ultimate liability for an increased  claims- cost would not  fall on the  Insurance Companies,  in that  any such increase would be met by an increase  of premiums at the triennial adjustments (save to  the extent of the additional 1  per cent., 2 per cent, or 2J per cent, above mentioned). On the Contrary, the higher the claims-cost, and  consequently the  premiums, the more the amount  receivable by the  Companies for expenses, and the larger their profit.     The responsibility for the amount of the compulsory insurance  rates to&quot; be levied, on the  public  should,  I submit, be  the  unfettered responsibility of a Minister of State, and would properly be scheduled  in Statutory Regulations to be laid1 before Parliament.   The recommendations of the  Report,  however, and the adoption of  the  Arrangement with the &quot;Accident  Offices Association would, in my view, supersede, or in any  view impair, such responsibility.   rA reference to the Appendix will show that  the Commissioner,  in fixing the rates,is to act on  the advice of an Advisory Committee.  The  particular right of  the accident Offices Association to claim arbitration may at any time be claimed against the  &quot;  Commissioners&quot;  Department,  and  ministerial  responsibilitv* Lock, 6,618,tlBaird, 8,123,JjNeill, 8,429,;
would thus be replaced by an arbitrators award.  This right, by the terms ofthe Arrangement set out in the Appendix, may be claimed at any time, and notmerely during the first triennial period.  It also appears to me that the virtualcontrol of the Committee would rest with the Accident Offices Association, inthat they are secured a compact body of representation amounting to one-half.On a Committee  so constituted,  the  interests of those who  have actually to subscribe the  requisite funds, namely, the employers, would be  insufficientlyrepresented.    On the  above  grounds,  I  regret  I do  not  see  my  way  to  concur  inmy colleagues&apos; recommendations contained in Part II of the Report.                         Settlement  of Disputes.    I desire to express my concurrence in the fourth paragraph of Mr. G-uthrie&apos;sMemorandum, and to add that the difficulty felt by the majority would,  I think,be adequately met by the  reversal of the decision referred to of Rawlings v.Hodgson (1918) 87 L.J., K.B. 761; for a claim to compensation, which has beenbrought within the statute and has thus come within the province of the  county court (or other Tribunal),  might  reasonably be re-submitted to the Court uponsettlement.    It should be appreciated that under  the, proposal  made in theReport the non-registration of an agreement settling a claim for damages would leave the workman  free to receive not only  the agreed  damages, but  weeklypayments of compensation as well.                                                W. R. L. TRICKETT. MEMORANDUM. BY MR. TOM SHAW, M.P., MR.  FRED  HALL, M.P.,                   AND CAPTAIN ALBERT  SMITH.    We have signed the foregoing Report on the understanding that on a numberof points we must make reservations, namely :    Injuries within the Scope of the A ct. We believe that, in view of the variousjudgments of the Courts, the words &quot; arising out of  and in the course of theemployment &quot; ought to be altered to &quot; arising in the course of the employment &quot;.    Total Incapacity. We are of opinion that full wages should be paid so longas total incapacity lasts.    Partial Incapacity. In cases of partial incapacity,  we are  of opinion thatthe payment  should be the full  difference  between wages earned prior to the accident and the wages received for the light employment.  We do not object toany reasonable  precautions being taken  against abuse,  but hold strongly thatworkmen should not be financially worse off  when suffering from the effects of an accident.    Fatal Cases.r-We are in agreement with the recommendations in the report with regard to fatal cases, except that we think that the payment to the widowshould be  300  instead of  i^O; and  where there is no widow or children, butthere are other total dependants, the payment should be the same as for the widow.In respect of any dependants other than but together with a widow or children,the sum should be  100 instead of  50; and in the case of  partial dependants, themaximum sum payable should be  300 instead of  250.    Taking the  coal mining industry as a  large and very dangerous one, we thinkthat the full cost of these recommendations  would be very slight on each ton ofcoal.

MEMORANDUM BY SIR WALTER KINNEAR, SIR ALFRED WATSON                     AND MR. W. R. L. TRICKETT.    Our signatures to the Report are.subject to the following qualifications:    We regret that we find ourselves at variance with  our colleagues as to themaximum  benefit  payable in cases of total  incapacity.  In  our judgment thepayment of benefit at the high rate proposed involves serious risks..    The original maximum benefit was  1 a week.  On 1st September, 1917, thiswas raised to 25s., at which rate  it was  continued until the end of 1919.  On
1st January, 1920, the maximum became 35s.  It is now proposed, after a few-months, and before we have any real experience of the most recent extension, to fix the rate at  3 a week.    We are impressed by the consideration that while the accident or industrial disease which  creates the right to compensation is, speaking broadly, a matterof fact, the duration of the incapacity is frequently determined by the tempera-ment  and the  will of the injured worker; and that, consequently, the rate ofbenefit may, in many cases, govern the length of the claims.    The  experience  of the  Friendly Societies  proves that the rate  of benefitreceivable in sickness has  a great influence upon  the duration of the claims, and ifthis be so in cases where the maximum benefit  seldom exceeds  1 a week, muchmore must it be the case  where compensation at the high rate of  3 per week isprovided,  especially as this amount will be supplemented, in a considerable pro-portion of cases, by sickness benefit obtained through Friendly Societies  and TradeUnions.         &apos;                                       &apos;  .    It must be borne in mind that the working  arrangement with the  insurance companies embodied  in  the Report  will substantially protect  the  Companiesagainst loss resulting from an undue protraction of claims.   This  will lessen the incentive for the exercise  of that strict  supervision over  the claims whichhas been such a prominent feature of the Companies&apos; administration in the past,and will deprive Workmen&apos;s Compensation of the safeguards which friendly societies and  Approved  Societies find so  essential  to  the effective  control of claims for Sickness Benefit.  This,  in  our  opinion,  is  an added reason forcaution in fixing the maximum rate of benefit.    Our  colleagues express  the  opinion that the average workman is anxiousto return to his work as soon as he is able, and is not disposed to malinger.   Wedo not dissent from that  conclusion, for we are  not prepared to apply the harshterm  &quot; malingering &quot; to that condition of inertia which is  so  frequently  setup by illness, but  from which, in the interests  of the workman himself, no lessthan in that of the community at large,  it is essential that the man shouldrecover as quickly as  possible.   If the high rate of benefit proposed by theCommittee be adopted, we fear that it will be followed by a disconcerting exten-sion of the average period of incapacity, with  a corresponding addition to thecost of compensation.  This is not, however, in our  opinion, the most seriousconsequence.   We attach greater importance  to the burden  placed  upon thecommunity by the correlated loss of productive energy.    Whether in coming to the opinion quoted above our colleagues have had inmind  actual malingering or the condition of  inertia  to which  we  attach thegreater importance, their views are of necessity  based upon the conditions whichhave prevailed  in  the past, with maximum benefits of  1 or 25s. a week.  Theexperience of recent years is also that of an exceptional period  during which,under  the great stimulus of patriotism, large  sections of the civil communitywere striving  to the uttermost in production vital to  the national effort.   a remarkable decline in the claims upon Friendly  Societies and Approved Societiesduring this period testifies to the strength  of the impelling motive, and  wecannot suppose that the  claims  for compensation were  uninfluenced  by it.   Inour view,  it is unwise to base proposals for the future on conclusions drawn from  the  wholly different circumstances of the past,  and especially  from theconditions prevalent during the  war.    We are constrained also to point out that the Report itself supplies cogentfacts  in  support of  the  views we hold.    In paragraph  74 it  discussesthe &quot; waiting period.&quot; and Quotes, from  the  experience  of  the Durham  andNorthumberland Coal Owners&apos; Association, striking figures as to the effect Ofthe provision of the Act  of 1906, under which, for the  first time, compensation was paid back to the date of injury if the incapacity lasted a fortnight.  In thelast year before this provision was made there were 1.7.931  cases of  non-fatalaccident in  the Durham area.   Of these the number  in which  the  incapacitylasted less than two weeks was 9.786, the number of cases of two weeks&apos; durationor more being 8.145.  But  in  1918, when,  if the incapacity lasted  a  fortnight,benefit was paid from the beginning, there were 17.285 cases, and of these thewhole  number  in  which  the case lasted less than two  weeks was onlv  1.753.while 15.532 lasted two  weeks  or  more.   The experience in Northumberlandwas almost precisely similar.  Faced  by figures such as these,, we feel that it isspecially incumbent on us to proceed with care in the further extension of thebenefits.    An  injured  workman  is  entitled  of right,  and. not  as  an act  ofmere  generosity, to the full benefits  which can justly  and1 fairly  be afforded.
The point at which the  maximum  should be placed is obviously a  matter ofopinion.   Guided by our experience, we conclude that  at the present time themaximum rate  should not exceed 50s.  a week.    We do not  accept the conclusion that the former maximum of  1 was fixedas a result of a calculation of 50 per cent, on the average wage of a well-paidworkman.  On  the contrary,  it appears to us that the  overriding maximum of 1 was inserted in the previous Acts, not by exact computation on a standardwage, but as representing a reasonable sum which, in the circumstances prevailingand having in view the nature of the liability, it was safe to fix.    Having regard to the present standard of wages, and the increase in the costof living, we look upon a maximum of 50s. as a fair equivalent of the  pre-warmaximum of  1, and in the unstable conditions  now existing we think it wouldbe ill-advised to carry  a higher maximum  into an  enactment of  a  permanentcharacter.  If there be a further general increase in wages in the future,  and experience suggests that  a  higher  maximum can properly  be granted, it  will always be possible to increase the rate by amendment  of the Act; and theprovision for triennial review of the premium, rates will afford the opportunityto distribute any consequent addition to the cost  of insurance over the  industries concerned.

TRICKETT.     We are unable to join in the recommendation that a Government officer should be appointed (paras. 26 and 107) to exercise the various administrative functions proposed in the Report.  This officer is referred to throughout the Report as the &quot; Commissioner,&quot; and although it is stated (in para. 26) that this term is used for the sake of convenience, and not with a view to  denoting the status to be given to him, it appears to us that the whole tenour of the Report and of the working arrangement made with the Accident Offices Association is such as to indicate that, in the view of the Committee, the administration of the new Act will require the appointment of a new official of high rank, with a staff to correspond.     This proposal appears to us to raise the question of Ministerial responsibility in a wider form than the Committee have recognised.  It is recommended in the Report that the  Commissioner should act under one of the Departments of State, so that a Minister can be responsible to Parliament for his acts, but, unless the official so designated is to carry out the whole of his duties under the directions of the Minister, which is not, we think, intended, this provision seems to us inadequate.  We hold strongly that certain of the powers proposed to be given to the Commissioner should only be exercised on behalf of and subject to the direc- tions of a Minister.  As an example, we draw attention to the working arrange- ment made with the Accident Offices Association, under which the Commissioner is,  in the first instance,  to approve, and, subsequently (with the advice of an Advisory Committee, of which the insurance companies will have half the member- ship), to fix the standard rates of premium payable by employers under insurance policies.  The obligation to insure is to be compulsory, and we hold that those upon whom the obligation is  placed are entitled to have proper facilities for securing Parliamentary criticism of the rates of premium levied upon them.  If the rates are fixed in  the manner indicated by the working arrangement,  no effective Parliamentary control will be possible.  In the ordinary course the rates of premium for any form of compulsory insurance would be contained in the Act of Parliament creating the obligation, and, while in. the circumstances of the present  case this course is impracticable, it is none the less essential that those who are called upon by law to pay premiums should have, if they desire it,  the protection of Parliamentary scrutiny of the rates.  We are of opinion, therefore, that these should be emboidied in  Regulations made by the Minister and laidbefore Parliament under conditions similar to those contained in  Sections 65 and 83 (4) of the National Insurance Act, 1911.    When  this important question of  constitutional principle  has  been settledwill be the time,  in our opinion. to decide the form the departmental organisation through which the responsible Minister will act.  29358                                                                v
    We dissociate ourselves from the opinion expressed in para. 107 that the costof the proposed Commissioner and his office should not exceed, at the outside, thesum of  30,000 a year, certain expenses otherwise provided for in the Reportbeing excepted. We have seen no details making up this estimate, and we do not know to what staff, and what salaries, the sum of  30,000 relates.   Further, wedo not know whether it includes the cost of the service to be borne by the votes of other Departments, e.g.,  the Ministry of  Health in relation to inspection, an item which, under the conditions set up by compulsory insurance, may be  con-siderable.   If expenditure such as this is not included, the sum quoted appearsto us to be unreliable.    Whatever the items making up the sum may be, we do not think a Committeesuch as  ours  is qualified  to frame an estimate as to  the cost of a  GovernmentOffice.  Intricate questions arise on the staffing of such an office, and involve thegrading of the work it is  to do, and its relation to other branches of the Depart-ment under which it may be placed.  Only when these technical matters havebeen settled by the authorities concerned can the probable cost of a new establish-ment be computed.                                                ALFRED. W.
