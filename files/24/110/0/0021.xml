VWIMMWI *******This  Document Is the PioDortv ofC1BIHBT.MEMORANDUM by  the Home Seoretary with regard to  the  adoption of  the 24 hour  method of expressing time.5      AB a result  of representations made by the Admiralty I appointed aCommittee to consider  the advisability of adopting in the United Kingdom for official and other public purposes the 24 hour method of expressing time.  Aoopy of the Committee^  report  is attached.  The Committee recommend that theMinistry of Transport  should  oall on the Railway Companies to adopt the 24hour method from a certain  date and that the 24 hour method should  be introduced into the Post Office simultaneously with itB adoption by the Railways.  ThePostmaster General has stated that he has no objection to the proposal and theMinister of Transport, after  consultation with the Railway Companies, isprepared to request them to make arrangements for the introduction  of the new system in their time tables and time bills next year.      There is general agreement as to the desirability of introducing the 24hour system but the question  of notation requires consideration. The admiralty and the War Offioe use a system in whioh there are always 4 figures. TheCommittee reoommend that this 4 figure system should be adopted with theintroduction of a  dot  to separate the figures denoting hours from the figuresdenoting minutes.   The General  Post Offioe say that it would be more suitablefor their purposes to  continue the present method of notation without the insertion of the noughts whioh  are used by the War Office and Admiralty.The four systems may  be illustrated as follow^:-Present Notation.   7.6 A.M.   7.5 P.M.  12.1 A.M.  12.1 P.M.

SIR,        1.  We have the honour to submit herewith the report of the Committee appointed  to  consider and report as  to the advisability of adopting in the United  Kingdom, for official and  other public purposes, the twenty-four-hour method of expressing time.      2.   Procedure. The Committee have  held five meetings, and received  evidence from such  authorities and public bodies as would appear most likely to be affected by the change if adopted,  in particular the postal, railway and shipping authorities.  It has also taken such steps  as were  possible to ascertain what views are entertained by members of the general public  in the  matter,  and whether the suggested change is looked upon with favour.      3.   Explanation. In the first place, it is as well to give some explanation of what  appears  to  be involved by  the adoption of the twenty-four-hour method, as in the course of its enquiries  the Committee has found some confusion to  exist  upon this point in  the minds of the.  general  public.      4.   The present method of reckoning the time of the day for ordinary purposes is to divide  the day  of 24 hours into two series of 12 hours, 1 12 a.m., and 1 12 p.m.  Under the  twenty-  four-hour method  it would  be reckoned&apos;by a continuous series of 24 hours (1 24 hours), not  involving the use  of the letters a.m. or p.m.  The day would start from midnight,  as  it does  now under the twelve-hour system,  and thus 9 a.m.  would become  simply 9;   1 p.m. would  become 13; 8 p.m., 20;  11.30 p.m., 23.30.     5.   General Considerations. The principal advantage of this system is that it eliminates  the use of  a.m. and p.m., which may be a  source of error and confusion, especially in written  expressions of time.  As to  what extent the a.m. and p.m. notation has in actual  practice  been  a source of confusion there  seems to be some divergence  of opinion.   Many persons,  including  individuals of wide public experience and authority, have stated that  they have never had any  knowledge  in  their experience of mistakes having arisen, but  a few particular instances  of  mistakes have been brought to the Committee&apos;s notice, and other persons are equally emphatic  in their  belief that mistakes do arise, and not only would these be obviated  if the twenty-four-  hour method were adopted,  but it would be much  simpler to follow railway time-tables drawn  up  on the twenty-four-hour  method.     6.   Another advantage is  that  the system would enable midnight to be specified more  concisely and with less liability  of  confusion.  Thus, under the a.m. - and p.m.  notation the  expression  midnight  1st December is  ambiguous, and may be taken for the  time  at which the  1st December begins or the time  at  which  it ends.  To  avoid error it is necessary to use the  expression  midnight  l-2nd December  to describe the point of time at which the  1st December  ends.   Under the twenty-four-hour system this point of time can either be described as 24 o&apos;clock  1st  December or nought o&apos;clock 2nd December,  and no  ambiguity arises.  Its great advantages  for naval use will  be dealt with later on (see  paragraphs  32-36).   (For a recommendation as to the numerical notation to be used, see paragraphs 50-54 below.)     7.  Alteration of Time-Pieces. A good many  persons who have written to the Committee on the subject appear to have been under the impression that the adoption of the twenty-four hour method would involve the alteration of clocks and watches and many have expressed  horror and fear  at the idea that the dial and chiming of Big Ben would be altered.   It would certainly be logical if the twenty-four hour method were adopted to have clocks and watches made with a 24-hour instead of a 12-hour face, but in practice  they would be  found to be very clumsy and probably difficult to read.   People  g-generally read the time on public clocks at  a glance by the mere position of the hands and this would be not nearly so easy to do on a clock with a 24-hour face.     8.  The Committee, however,  are of opinion  that the  adoption  of  the twenty-four-hour method would not make it necessary that the dials of watches and clocks should be altered from a 12-hour to a 24-hour face,  and in fact it is  understood that in  the countries  where it is  now used watches and  clocks have not been so  altered.  The only alteration that might  possibly be found convenient by  individuals, and could be adopted at will, would be to have a  second circle  of  figures (13-00)  added on  the dial inside  the  existing  figures (1-12).  Even without such alteration the  general public would, it is  surmised, soon become accustomed to the change.     9.  Extent to  which Twenty-four-hour  Method now  Used. The twenty-four-hour method is already employed in many countries  in  Europe, viz.: France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy and also in India.  It is not in use in Germany, Austria or  Scandinavia, but  its adoption in Austria is, it is understood, being considered.  It was adopted in Canada on. the Canadian Pacific Railway, but as that  line touched other lines not employing it, it  had to be abandoned, though it is still retained in working time tables.  At  the present time the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway print their Continental time tables in the twenty-four-hour method,  and anybody having recourse tothe British Continental time  tables  will be familiar with it.     10.  It  has been exclusively adopted for five years in the Navy and tentatively for several years before that.   (28225-1) Wt. 1740-0  342 12,20, 75  7/20 H. St,  Qp. 1
     11.   It was adopted universally in the Army as from the 1st October, 1918, for the purposeof securing uniformity with the Allies  who had been using it  and also with our own naval forces, the disadvantage of two systems of reckoning time having  become apparent with theprogress of the war.   For these same reasons it had  previously been used during the war inthe  Egyptian  Expeditionary  Force and  Salonican Expeditionary Force.   It had also beenemployed before the war in the Army in India, where, as has been explained above, it has beenthe official notation for several years.     12.  The  naval authorities declare  that  it  is  indispensable for Service communications and  the old system would  never be reverted to.  In fact it was the Admiralty who raised  hesuggestion that the twenty-four-hour method should be  used for all official purposes, and thepresent Committee  owed its origin to that suggestion.     13.  During the latter part of the war the British railway companies in the United Kingdomadopted the twenty-four-hour notation at the request of the War Office for trains moving troopsabout the country.     14.  It may be a matter of general interest to record the manner in which the twenty-four-hour notation was  introduced into  France and Italy and the extent to  which it is now used,upon which points evidence was received from a representative of the North of France railway and  a representative of the Italian State Railways and steamship lines.     15.  France. It was first introduced into  the French Army  about 1909-10&apos;, in order toremove confusion and  mistakes arising from the  use of the twelve-hour notation, and to avoiddelays  in  writing military  orders.    16.  In this matter the French language was at a disadvantage to the English, as it  hadno designation corresponding to the a.m.  and  p.m.  notation,  and  the  expressions &quot; in  the morning &quot; and &quot; in the afternoon &quot; had to be written out in full.     17.  After its  introduction into the Army it became rapidly adopted  for general officialpurposes.  About 1912 it was introduced into the State Railways, and then it began to be used by other non-State  railways.  It received a great impetus from  the  war, because everyone inFrance was more or less concerned in military matters, and from the railway and government officials downwards  everyone began  to fall in with it.  It was adopted in the workshops and toa large extent in civil  and private undertakings and even in ordinary conversation.     18.  The. peasants are  said not to have taken to it, but neither are they said to have takento summer time, nor do questions of time-reckoning enter greatly  into their routine of life.     19.  Italy. It was introduced on the  1st November, 1893,  on  the  Italian  railways by a royal  Decree of the  10th  August,  1893,  and has since  then been  completely adopted by thepublic  in  commercial matters and by Public Authorities.     20.  It is in fact the standard method of expressing  time in all  spheres, private as well as public, though the  twelve-hour notation still holds its ground in ordinary social conversation.Thus one  person will ask another verbally whether he will dine  with him at 8, but in letters and  written invitations the hour would be expressed as 20.    21.  No disadvantages from the twenty-four-hour  method have  made themselves felt,  andno alteration has been made to the faces of watches and clocks, except that in some  clocks asecond circle of figures 13-00 have been added to the dial.    22. Deductions from use in France and Italy. This evidence  is particularly interestingas showing:                                  i       (1)  How readily and easily the ordinary citizens  adapted themselves to the  use of the            twenty-four-hour method in  official and other matters.       (2)  How once the method  was adopted  officially  and on the railways its adoption for            other purposes tended  to spread automatically into business life.      (3)  But how at  the same time, for  social and domestic purposes and  in common speech,            the twelve-hour method is still  partly retained.    23.  The evidence shows in effect that  the two systems can run side by. side without  anyinconvenience or confusion being caused,  the twenty-four-hour system being used for the rail-ways, official, business  and other public purposes,  the twelve-hour system  for ordinary purposes,domestic and social.    24.  The  explanation  is probably that in  matters of common speech there  is  never  any doubt as to the hour of day referred to, and in case of doubt it is easy to add &quot; in the morning,&quot;or &quot; in the evening,&quot; but  in  written communications on  which business  and  official affairsdepend and where brevity is all important these words  are unnecessarily long and symbols suchas a.m. and p.m. are more liable to be a source of error.    25.  The  twelve-hour method  remains the  natural mental  basis  for calculating time,  hutin practice, when expressing time in writing or  print it is found more convenient to expressit by the twenty-four-hour method.    26.  The consideration  of the use of the twenty-four-hour method for social and privatepurposes falls outside  the Committees terms of reference, but these remarks have been madefor the sake of clearness.    27. Public Interests Principally Affected.-&quot;!^  principal public interests  that may beexpected to be affected by the adoption of the twenty-four-hour method are the postal authorities,the railways and shipping.    28.  The Post  Office have  experienced no inconvenience under  the present system, but ifthe twenty-four-hour method were adopted they  would be  ready to fall in with it and anticipatetin difficulty  in  doing so, provided it was at the same time applied  on the railways.   There
  would be some slight advantage telegraphically in foreign cable working with countries using  the  twenty-four-hour system,  and  from the point of view of the public the twenty-four-hour  notation might obviate some difficulty in telegraphing time.      29.   If adopted, the postal authorities would have to change the tablets and figures in the  letter boxes used for denoting the  times of collection and provide new type for the date stamps  for letters.  They might possibly have to make some small changes in time registers and other  timing apparatus in internal use in the Post Office Service.      30.  The Telephone Service would not be affected.      31.  Railways. Opinions have been sought from the railway companies, and while several  are strongly, hi favour and a few opposed to  any alteration, the bulk appear indifferent on the  matter.  It is significant, however, that those  which have much Continental passenger traffic* and  therefore most experience of the operation  of the system on the Continent are in favour of  the alteration.      32.  Shipping. It has already been explained that the twenty-four-hour method of express-  ing time has been in use in the Navy for five years, and the Admiralty are in favour of its  adoption for all official and public  purposes.     33.  As  an  indication  of  their belief  in  the system they have  already  published  the  Admiralty Tide Tables for the current year on the twenty-four-hour system, and all logs in use  in the Navy are entered up in this system.  Although in deep sea navigation time is reckoned  from noon to noon for purposes of  calculating positions  only, seamen have always looked upon  this  system as apart from the time used for the  purposes of regulating their civil duties on  board ship.  But it is proposed that the  elements of the Nautical Almanac shall be altered in  1925 to commence at midnight instead of noon, and, when this is done, the twenty-four-hour  day will start from the same point for all purposes in the Royal Navy. &apos;     34.   A favourable view  of the twenty-four-hour system  was  taken by representatives of  the Chamber of  Shipping and the London Short Sea Traders Association.  In fact  the  repre-  sentative from the  Chamber of Shipping stated that he had heard  no dissentient voice from  a practical seaman on the point; he considered that the new Admiralty tide tables  were very much clearer and it would be  very much better to  use the twenty-four-hour method throughout the Sea Service.     35.   To ascertain  the views  of their  members  the  Chamber of Shipping, who  embrace shipowners and shipping associations throughout the United Kingdom, issued a circular to them on the subject.  Of the 32 replies received 25 were approvals of the proposed change, three, while approving it, were to some extent doubtful as to the wisdom of making a change which might cause confusion;  four expressed the opinion  that  no alteration  should  be made, but  gave no reason for  their  objections except  that they thought that the change would  cause confusion. The Chamber received no objections from any direct shipping interests as to  its bad effect on shipping, and  at a meeting of their Council on the 18th December, after some discussion,  the Chamber approved the proposed change.     36.  The London Short Sea Traders&apos; Association, on the other hand, were in the first place, though not definitely against the change, of the opinion  that it was unnecessary and therefore undesirable.  Their coasting captains, cross channel captains  and home-trade captains were all in favour of letting things alone.   They regarded the question principally from the navigation point of view, and as the day used by navigators begins and ends at  noon, the change  was  not considered  to be of any assistance.  But when the Committee explained to the  Association^ representative the alterations already made in the Admiralty tide tables, &amp;c, the representative agreed that that  removed the Association^ objection, and in his opinion they would regard it as an advantage.                                                               *    37.   Other Public Authorities. The evidence received by the Committee from other public authorities  has been, generally speaking, of a negative character.    38.   Seventeen  chief constables,  besides the&apos;Commissioners of the Metropolitan  and City Police,  were asked for their opinions upon the proposed change.   Many of the replies were indecisive, and not a few of the chief constables appeared to be under the impression that  thechange  in the system would involve the alteration of time-pieces with its consequent  disadvan- tages, but on the whole eleven appeared to regard the proposal with favour and seven thoughtthat it was  undesirable.  Four stated that they had no experience of mistakes or inconveniencearising  from the present a.m. and p.in. notation,  but about  a  similar number thought thatmistakes did occur,  and would be  eliminated by  the twenty-four-hour notation.   The othersthought the change would generally be more advantageous and convenient, though it^ might, inthe transition period from one method to another, cause some confusion.   The Commissioner ofthe Metropolitan Police, while on the whole in favour of the change, doubted whether it wouldbe understood by a large portion of  the public, or, though  it had been a success in the Army, itwould necessarily  be a success in police work where, in  connection with summonses, lightingregulations, &amp;c, the public were largely concerned.    39.  The evidence received &quot;from the  County Councils Association proved also to be of a negative  character.  The Executive Committee of  the Association  discussed the subject, andthe members were  almost equally divided for and against the change.   On the whole, the Com-mittee appeared to think that the County  Councils  would naturally be prejudiced  against anychange that affected  daily life unless strong advantages in its favour could be shown,^ and theywould not take much interest in it  as it had not become a matter of general public interest.    40.   The  Council of the Municipal Corporations Association expressed  themselves, after consideration, in favour of the change.
      41.  Public  Associations, A list of  the  trade  unions,  labour  organisations,  employers&apos; organisations and other  bodies which have been consulted by the Committee is given in the Appendix.  It was desired to obtain their views, not only to  gain a better idea of the  attitude which the ordinary citizen would be likely to take up in the matter, but also to ascertain  whether the  change would  affect employers or workers in  their work, e.g.t  time-keepers in factories, telegraphists, postmen, railway clerks, engine-drivers, &amp;o.      42.  Several of the organisations preferred not to give evidence  for or against  the change as they did not consider that  it would  materially affect them.   One big employer of labour declared himself,  after careful deliberation,  to be against  the change,  as he  regarded the advantages to be gained as not commensurate  with the  cost and inconvenience that would  be involved.   The same view was shared by one of  the Trade Unions, but on the other hand another Trade Union and two Associations representing principally  employers were generally in favour, of it.  One recommended that if the  change were made it should he made  gradual,  and not compulsory at the outset.      43.  Much opinion clearly had not been aroused or directed  to  the subject,  and where it had  been  it was  indecisive or more or  less  equally  divided.  The principal objection,  as  in other cases, was the unfounded one that the adoption of the  change would necessitate the altera- tion  of watches and clocks,  and this was naturally regarded  as undesirable.     44.   A letter was received from the Royal Meteorological Society stating that the  Council of the Society had passed a resolution  expressing their approval, and explaining that the system was  already in use to a considerable  extent in  the Science  of Meteorology,  and it was felt desirable that it should be generally adopted for everyday affairs.     45.   Public Opinion, A considerable number of letters have been received from members of the general public, some for and some against the change.  Those for it slightly  outnumber those against it.     46.   Those which favour the char,ge are generally written by persons who have travelled on the Continent and in India and have had personal experience of the twenty-four-hour notation. Such persons, with few exceptions, seem to give their testimony in its favour,  and  consider that it is  much simpler and clearer than  the twelve-hour notation, and eliminates possibilities  of mistakes.   Those  who oppose the change generally oppose  it out of conservatism,  or  because they  think it would cause  confusion or  entail  the  alteration  of  time-pieces,  or that it would yield no substantial advantage, as they consider that the mistakes arising under the  present notation are few or none at all.     47.   On the whole, the subject has  excited comparatively little  public interest, and  it is not safe to deduce from the fact that the letters favouring  the change exceed those  against it that there is a preponderating body of opinion in its  favour.     48.   It is not,  in fact, surprising that the public has  shown  itself apathetic, because the suggested change  is little more than one of nomenclature and does not materially affect  daily life.   &apos; 49.   The absence of serious objection may  justify the belief that if the change were  made the general public  would  readily accommodate  themselves to it as they  have  done  on the Continent.    50.  Notation. There remains to be considered what notation, if the change is made, should be adopted.    51.  The notation used by the Admiralty is 4  digits  without  a break, viz., 0000 for mid- night; 0103 for 1.3  a.in.,  and 2359 for 11.59  p.m.   Admiralty instructions lay  down  that &quot; Time is to be reckoned in four figures, reckoning the hours from 00 to 23, and the minutes from  00  to 59.&quot;    52.  The advantage of this 4 digit notation is that it avoids any possible confusion between hours and  minutes.   Thus,  if hours are not represented by two digits, 015 might 1.5 a.m., or 15 minutes after midnight.    But with the group  0015  no such doubt could  arise.    It also prevents the insertion of an  erroneous figure.    53.  But there are other forms of notation  to be met with in  Continental  Railway Guides, and these are subject to numerous variations.   Sometimes midnight is expressed as zero, some- times  as 24.  Two minutes past midnight  is  found as 0002 or 00.02, .02, or 0 2 (with a gap between  both figures); 5 a.m. as 0500, 05.00, 5.00, or simply  5; 5.3 a.m. as0503, 05.03, 5.03, or 5 3 (with a  gap between both figures), &amp;c.   But the  problem  in railway guides is comparatively simple, because there are always four spaces allowed for four figures, and it is easy when times are arranged one below another to show by spacing whether 11 represents 11 a.m. or 1.1 a.m., or 11 minutes past midnight.    54.  On the whole the Admiralty notation is ihe most logical, but  we think that for  general purposes it would  be convenient to separate the two figures  indicating the hours  from the twowhich indicate the minutes by a  dot  or otherwise, e..q., the Admiralty method  would denote2.20 p.m. by the figures 1420.   We suggest that these figures should be written 14.20.    55.  Time for Introduction.-!!  the twenty-four-hour notation were adopted  for the rail-ways,  six clear months&apos;  notice would have to be allowed for  the publication of the time tables.If the October time  tables were to be based on it, a decision should be reached before April.    56.  So far as the Post Office is concerned  one month&apos;s  notice would possibly  be  sufficient,but as a  new postal guide would have  to be issued it would  be more convenient to synchronisethe introduction with the date of  a  periodical  issue, which falls quarterly,  viz., on the 1stJanuary, 1st April, 1st July, or the 1st October in each year.    57.  Necessity  for Legislation.-^ is.doubtful if  this  subject falls within  the terms ofreference of the Committee, but the Committee offer it as their opinion that if the proposed  .
 hotaioii were adopted merely for the railways and postal service, no legislation would be required and the necessary instructions could be issued in the ordinary course of administration.  If it were adopted for all official purposes it might be advisable to proceed by statute to remove any possibility for doubt in the interpretation of existing Acts containing expressions of time, e.g., burglary is denned as the breaking and entering into or out of the dwelling-house of another in the night time between 9.0 p.m. and 6.0 a.m.; during the other hours such an offence would be considered to be house-breaking.     58.   Scotland.-^-The opinion  of  the  Scottish  Authorities  is  that  the  application  of the twenty-four-hour notation to Scotland  raises no questions which would  affect Scottish interests dfferently from the interests of other parts of the  United Kingdom, that they are aware of no objections to its introduction and would be ready to fall in with it if adopted.     59.   The remarks made previously about the railways cover the Scottish railways.     60.   Ireland. Irish opinion appears to  be opposed to its application- to Ireland,.  but  we recognise that if it is adopted in Great Britain it ought logically to be introduced into Ireland.     61.   Conclusion and Recommendation. We have come to the conclusion that the adoption of the system of calculating the time in one period of 24 hours instead of two periods of  12 hours each has considerable advantages, but we do not think it necessary or desirable to suggest the  introduction of legislation at  present to enforce the use of the system  for all public and official purposes.     62.   We recommend that the  Ministry of Transport should be asked to call on  the railway companies to adopt the twenty-four-hour system from a certain date.  The railway time tables are  used  so generally that we think  the benefit of the new method would  soon appeal to  all concerned, and that other public bodies and large commercial interests would see the advantage of its adoption.     63.   We are satisfied that the alteration of  the railway time tables  could be easily effected Avithout any great expense.  From the opinions we have obtained it is evident that most of the railway companies are willing to adopt it, and that those who have much Continental passenger traffic and are therefore experienced in Continental  practice are in favour of its adoption.     64.   The work of the Post Office is so intimately bound up with the  railway service that we feel  that the adoption of the twenty-four-hour system by the railways would in practice entail its adoption  by the  Post Office.   We therefore recommend that  the twenty-four-hour  system should be introduced  into the Post Office simultaneously with  its adoption by the railways.     65.   If the public take to the alterations as  we expect they will, we  are of opinion that the shipping lines will readily adopt it.     We desire to thank our Secretary, Mr. Holderness, for his services in obtaining information for the Committe and drafting the Report.
