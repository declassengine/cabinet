No flat increase is recommended In respect of cart-age, as Irish rates which include cartage have previously been advanced to cover increased cost.          It is recommended that the Great Southern &amp; Westernrates should be made subject to the 4$ and 10$ additions which)applied to other Irish rates before the new increases areadded.          Increases are recommended in the harbour dues atRosslare, in cranage charges at Dublin, Cork and Waterfordand for weighing coal at North Wall.          As regards through traffic between Ireland and england, the Committee recommend that the same sea sur-charge should apply as to-day, and to meet the difference in the percentage addition between Ireland and Great Britain,It Is proposed that after the British additions have been added the through rates should be increased by flat additionsgraded according to the distance of the Irish station from the nearest Irish port by which the through rates apply.
FINANCIAL ESTIMATE.                                                  For Great Britain the amount of the deficiency is:                               66,000,000 The estimated yield from the ia-   crease in passenger fares is:              17,000,000 Leaving to be raised from merchant^   dise by freight and passenger                  ^   trails:      ^                              W70O0.?c5I To preside this sum In 11 months    the increase must be such as to    produce in a full year:                    53,500,COOThe Railway Companies estimate a full year^ yield from the suggestions they put forward to -be as follows:-  Passenger train traffic and cloak-    room charges:                               3,750,000  Freight train traffic:                       43,800,000There has been an increase in the  quantity of goods carried by  freight train during the first  half of 1920, estimated at 10$.  If this increase continues the yield  from the freight train traffic will  be Increased by:                              4,380,000  Increases in connection with dock  undertakings:                                 2,800,-00054,730,000From this must be deducted the  concessions recommended by the  Committee in respect of coal, manure,  returned empties, cloak room  charges and bicycles etc:                     1,600,00053,130,000To make good the deficiency the  Committee recommend that the flat  increase in Class C should be 9d  in place of 6d proposed by the  Companies, the estimated yield  being:                                          454,500TOTAL.       53,58*,500It will be seen that no. margin whatever is pro-vided for the diminution or diversion of traffic
4i   skbukp.For Ireland the amount of the  deficiency is.                          2,954,000The estimated yield from the  increase in passenger fares is:         1,200,000Leaving to be raised from merchandise  by freight and passenger traiawTo provide this sum in 11 months  the increase must be such as to  produce in a full year;                 lf878,500The anticipated increase from passenger  train traffic and cloak rocms is:         200,000  And from freight train traffic and  dock charges:                           g,465,000                                          2,653,000Some deduction should be made from this for the con-ceasion suggested in respect of returned empties andon manure; but even after allowing for this, there isa fair margin to provide against loss of traffic.&amp;  GENERAL MATTERS.    (a) AGRICULTURAL TRAFFIC.                  In the January revision milk and manures, in-        eluding packed manures, were exempted from increase?        fruit, vegetables, eggs, butter and poultry by passenger        train were only Increased by 25$, and potatoes, vegetables        and fruits In 2 to*n lots by freight train were only in-        creased by 25$.  Shis time all these concessions are        swept away, excepting in the case of manure, where traffic        in 2 ton lots for home consumption le only to be increased        by 50$ instead of 100$.  It Is understood that this        recommendation has been inserted on representations from;        the Ministry of Agriculture.    (b) 8XISOT0 COMIRAC^.                  No special treatment is recommended.  It is        suggested that the Traders should be left to such remedy        (if any) as they have under Section 3 of the Ministry of        Transport Act.    (c) EXCEPTIONAL RATES.                  No Immediate revision, but all exceptional rates        should be overhauled and systemised and Railway Companies        requested to submit a definite scheme for bringing them up to        a standard based on actual circumstances, before the Committee        proceed to deal with the question of classification.
(d)   READJUSTMENT W 1921,          As passenger fares have been lightly dealt withas compared with goods rates, the Committee think thelatter have a special claim for consideration when thetime for readjustment comes next year.(o) APPEALS FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT.                 Attention is called in the report to requests       from witnesses for specially favourable treatment on grounds       which have no connection with the problem of transport by       rail, e.g., the housing problem, juvenile employment, un-       remunerative workmenss fares.  The Committee express the       opinion that the transport industry should not be called upon       to bear, at its own expense, the needs of other branches of       industry or other sections of the community.  They point out       that there is no good reason why passengers and traders of       the United Kingdom, or the railway shareholders, should pay       for grants to the dwellers in and around London, or should       be chosen to subsidise education or otherwise take upon them-       selves burdens which are sometimes local and sometimes should       fall upon the whole community.                                                                   !6.               There Is one point upon which I am in communication       with Mr.Qore Browne in regard to the Committee&apos;s proposal       on pages 14 and 15 of their report that in respect of the       passenger train; scales for certain articles an excess distance ,       of 5 miles over the scale shall be disregarded, e.g*, a dist-       ance not exceeding 105 miles would be counted as 100 miles.7.               With the exception referred to in paragraph 6 I       recommend that the proposals of the Committee be adopted       and the approval of the Cabinet is sought for instructions       to be issued to the Companies accordingly.*Sgd.)

RATES ADVISORY COMMITTEE,rMinistry of Transport-^Whitehall, S.1T.1.To the Right Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, G.C.B.,G.B.E..K.P.Minister of Transport.Interim Revision of Railway Rates,  Pares,  Tolls  and Charges               July 1920 - Part 11  Goods.Sir,We the Rates Advisory Committee, set up under Section 21 ofthe Ministry of Transport Act 1919, duly received your referencedated the 7th July, 1920 stating that it is estimated that thefinancial result of working British Railways (including Ireland) will show a deficiency as from the 1st April, 1920 at the rate of  54,500,000per annum, and that it is the declared policy of the Government thatthe Railways are to be maintained on a self supporting basis and desiring us to consider and advise you what increases should be madein the rates, fares, tolls, dues and charges of the Railway companies of the United Kingdom so as to yield by the end of June 1921 (a date which was subsequently extended to the end of July 1921) the totaldeficit ?;hich commenced to accrue on the 1st April 1920.   You asked us to treat the Irish Railway Companies as a separate unit and statedthat the total deficit of those railways might be assumed to be at therate of  2,200,000 per annum - and called attention to the increases which should be charged by the Great Southern and Western RailwayCompany of Ireland whose rates had not been subjected to the percentage increases in respect of Goods traffic in 1913 and 1916.   You alsospecially called attention to the Importance of the fair maintenance ofCoastwise Traffic and asked us to advise what Increases should be madein the exceptional rates charged by the Railway Companies in consequenceof Water Competition.   Further you asked our advise on the question to what extent the Railway Companies * charges in respect of service and accommodation provided at their docks should be increased.   Lastly you
                                   \as^ced advice as to. what Increases should he made in the charges for Season Tickets and in Workmen&apos;s fares and other fares lower than ordinary fares which had been the subject of an earlierreference dated 5th May, 1920.          Inasmuch as more than three months of the period over which the deficiency has to be made good had expired before yourreference was issued we realised the importance of an early report,so that the new charges should be brought into operation withoutdelay and the deficiency spread over aa long a period as possibleThe time necessary to put in force new rates for the carriage ofgoods can hardly be less than one month after the receipt of our report seeing that under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888not less than 14 days public notice is required and much preliminary work has to.be done by the Railway Companies in preparing in detail the instructions to the stations necessary to carry out yourdirection.   We accordingly came to.the conclusion that the 1stSeptember is the earliest date upon which the new goods rates and charges can be brought into force.   The preliminaries necessary ,for bringing into operation Passenger fares are not so complicated andthere is no, necessity to give 14 days notice.   We accordinglyhastened,that part of our report which deals with passenger fares and were.able to deliver It at the Ministry of Transport shortly after midday on Saturday July 24th, hfcfling that an early day wouldbe fixed for putting the new fares into force so as to extend theperiod in which the deficiency is to be made good and upon theassumption that the 5th August would be the date we recommended the smallest increase which we thought could be charged without doing  -injustice to the Traders interested in the carriage of goods.   Wodealt in that preliminary report with ordinary passenger fares,Workmen1 s fares and Season and Traders Ticket ratss, reservifjg tilllater a few less- important questions as to other fares lower v*- -than ordinary.
          We  too.ii..evtdenc-e..in public  on three, -lays- on- the question .of Season and Traders  tickets  and Workmen^s  fares and  on eight days on the  general  question the two enquiries extending  from the 6th to the 23rd  July.. 1?20.  We  heard  61  witnesses in  all.          Sir George  Beharrell, D.S.O.,  Director General of the finance m&amp;  Statistical  Department  of the Ministry  of Transport told us that the  actual  deficit in  railway receipts in Great Britain for  the months Of April, May &amp; June  1920  was  9,900,000 ana that the  estimated cash deficiency for the  twelve months from 1st July        ii 1?20 to 30th. June 1921  (taking into  account the increase in wages from 1st  July***1920)  is  52,300,000,  making  a total  deficiency for the  15 months from 1st April 1920 to 30tn June 1?21 of  62,200,000, To raise  that sum in 10 months (i.e. from the 1st September 1920 to the 30th  June 1921) would make it necessary that rates end fares should be charged whioh would produce   74,64-0,000 in &amp; year;  but if the period of charge is  extended  to 31stvJuly, 1921 the deficiency must  be computed for 16 months and will  be  66,000,000 and  this  sum must be raised between  the time when the new rates and fares are imposed and the 31st July, 1921.   We have procured an estimate  from the Finance and statistical Department of the Ministry of Transport that the sum which will be produced  from Passenger Fares in  Great Britain  if our recommendations as  to the increase of Passenger fares  are  adopted will  be  for the period  expiring on the 31st July, 1921   17,000,000 leaving  as the  amount to be produced        *****!in Great  Britain from the rates and  charges for the carriage of Minerals, merchandise and live stock by goods and passenger trains  49,000,000. To provide this sum in eleven months  (i.e. from 1st  September 1920  to 31st  July,  1921) the  rates  and charges to be imposed in respect  of the carriage of  minerals merchandise  and live stock by  goods and passenger train in  Great Britain must be suoh a3 would  produce  53,500,000 in a year.  We have  accordingly directed  our attention  to considering  what  increases must be made in such last mentioned  rate3 and  charges  to provide this sum of  53,500,000, The figures relating to  Ireland are stated later.
          The Railway Companies laid before us certain suggestionsregarding the increases which they estimated would be necessary InGreat Britain to provide the sums which they calculated would berequired to provide the revenue demanded by the reference to us.The figures appearing in these suggestions require qualificationin as much as they were calculated upon the footing that the periodof charge would expire on the 30th June 1921 but they containedestimates of the amounts which would be produced in a year by theincreased rates which they proposed and from these figures thefollowing estimates are derived.   We omit reference to the RailwayCompanies proposals as to Passenger Fares, as we have already made our reocmmendations on them.

Deducting this sum fromthe amount stated above, the increase for a year to be de-rived from the above proposals as compared with the revenue from, the rate3 now in force will be  43,800,000 or adding theestimated increase in the produce from the advances in therates for goods by passenger train  47,550,000.   There has,however, been an increase in the quantity of goods carried by merchandise trains during the first half of 1920,estimated as being at the rate of 10$ of the whole.   If this increase is continued the amount to be received from the advances in rates for the carriage of goods by merchandisetrains will be increased by  4,380,000 and the total increase in the receipts for a year as compared with those
for 19319 will be j  51,930,000* if the proposals of theiWlway ,Companies&apos; are adopted, and to this must be added the increases to be derived as hereinafter mentioned from the     *Dock Undertakings estimated at  2,800,000, making a grand &apos;                                         ..rtotal of  54,730,000.          The proposals of the Railway Companies may besummarised as follows:-  There is a general proposal thatall rates in force on the day before the last interim revision(i,e* the 14th January, 1920), with the exception of those for Goal, Coke and Patent Fuel (for which special proposals are made) shall be doubled, but so that the maximum additionfor goods in Class A shall be 4/- per ton.   That further,the following flat rate additions shall be made viz., for goods in Class A.B. and C., 6d.&apos;per ton, for those in Classes1-5, l/- per ton, and a further increase of .1/6 per ton forcollection and 1/6 per ton for delivery shall be made whereversuch collection or delivery is included in the rate, and inthe case of Live Stock rates per truck a flat rate additionof 2/- per truck or part truck beyond the 100$ increase isproposed.  In the case however, of Returned Empties, theproposed addition is 200 per cent and in the case of Smalls150 per cent.  The proposed rates for Coal, Coke and PatentFuel show much greater increases in the case of short distancehauls than in the case of longer hauls being -   Where the Pre-war charge did not exceed 6d. an increase of 1/-   Where the Pre-war charge was from 6d to 3/6 an increase of                                   100$ 4 6d. flat rate,                                                             t   Where the Pre-war charge exceeded 3/6d. an increase of 4/-But it was calculated that notwithstanding the divergence ofmethod the percentage increases upon the various Classes ofgoods taken as a whole were not very different, being asshown belowj-                                                /Coal

A comparison of the two&apos;Schemes will be found on page 71 of the print of theevidence taken before as on the 14th July, 1920.     In the revision of January, 1920, the percentage increases were upon a graduated scale, being 25$ for Coal;  30$ for therest of Class A;  40$ for Class B;  50$ for Class- G.*  and 60$ forClasses. 1-5, whereas under the present proposals the percentages(with a few exceptions) are uniform.   $he maintenance of thepre-war relations of the various classes by the imposition of a uniform percentage increase is supported on two grounds (1) wewere told that the prospects of loss of traffic by the competition,of road carriage by motor wans would be greater in the case of the.higher classes than in that of the &quot;heavy&quot; classes and (2) asrates based upon, though not identical with, the present revision;will probably be in force when the railways are returned to theirrespective owners, a variation of the pre-war relations of Glass-to Class might have very serious or even, disastrous effects uponsome of the individual Companies e.g., if the rates for Coal shouldbe increased only 25$ or 50$ it might be impossible for those companies the bulk of whose traffic consists of coal to continue their business successfully.   We found.that the Railway Companies                                                           /as
m a whole and the majority of tho Traders Including theseinterested In the coal and Iron traffic are In favour of a uniform percentage increase and we accordingly recommend theadaption of this principle *   The hallway Companies are infavour of small flat rate additions as well as the percentage increases, but the majority of the Traders are opposed to them.We however, recommend the adoption of such flat rate additions inainasmuch as there are expenses such as signalling, shunting andclerkage which are incurred in relation to every haul whetherthe haul is long or short and the time during which a wagon isin use does not vary directly with the length of ths haul, whilethe increase in cost to the Failway Companies is specially heavyin connection with these constant factors.          $aken as a whole, the proposals of tho Hallway companies were not objected to by the Traders, and we recommend their adoption generally, but upon certain points which are hereafterset out we advise variations from the Companies proposals.          Coal^ m Poke and Patent Jtggj.&apos;   In our opinion theImposition of a fiat rate of yV per ton in all cases where theprewar rate did not exceed 6d. per ton operates too severelyupon some of the very low rates and we advise that In all caseswhere the pre-war rate did not exceed V$ per ton the increase should be 100$ together with a flat rate of 6d. per ton.   Theresult of this concession we are advised will reduce the amountproduced by the Increases by  66,000.          Agriculture,   In the revision of January, 1920, certain concessions as regards manures and agricultural produce weremode for the benefit of agriculture.   On the present occasionwo do not see our way to recommend the continuance of these concessions * with the exception of that relating to manure;   asto which we recommend and advise that  the rates charged for the carriage of articles used for Agricultural Manures in bulk,
 \ including Soot, Pish for Lianure and other similar substances. and for packed manure, basic slag and lime for agricultural purposes in 2 ton loads should not be increased by more than 50$ over the rates in force on 14th January, 1920, but that this exceptional treatment should not be extended to packed or other manure for export.  The result of this concession we are advised will reduce the amount produced by the increases by  321,000,        Returned Empties.   The case made by the Hallway&apos; Companies for an increase of the,rates for Returned Empties was based on the fact that these form a very unsatisfactory traffic for the Railway Companies, be in costly to handle and giving a very light load per truck.  The case from that point of view is a strong one but we are informed that an increase of 200% would Impose a very heavy bnrden upon large classes of Traders, and we take into account that in many cases the Traders pay a hi^i class rate on the weight of the timber used in packing on the outward journey.  &apos;^e accordingly advise that the rates for the carriage of Returned. Empties by goods train should be increased by 100$ and no more and that the same increase should be applied to Returned Empties by Passenger Train.  The result of adopting these recommendations will be to reduce the amount which theRailway Companies estimated as the produce of the increases they proposed by  ,1,000,000 in the case of Returned Empties by GoodsTrain and- 100,572 in the case of Returned Empties by PassengerTrain.                                                      1         There are some cases: where special trains or special trucks are run for the carriage of a commodity and return empty i to the place of the original consignment.  This happens particularly in the carriage,of Fish and Fresh Fruit.  &apos;&apos;here
\ this oocurs we think that special rates might with advantage be arranged by negotiation between the railway companies and the traders for the carriage of returned empties in bulk by such trains.        &quot;Smalls&quot;.    We considered anxiously the question of the adoption of an increase of 150.$ as proposed by the railway companies for the carriage of &quot;Smalls&quot;.   This traffic is costly to the railways and is an uneconomical method of con- signing goods.  The charging of a light rate encourages the dispatch of small parcels to the prejudice of other traffic, and the amount to be obtained by an increase in the rates of 150$ as compared with 100$ is&apos;substantial ( 1,731,000).  While regretting that traders should have to suffer this additional burden we recommend that the Companies1 proposal to increase the rates by 150$ should be adopted.         Cloak Room Charges.   V?e do not think that the Companies&apos; proposal to increase cloak room charges by 100$ with a minimum of 4d per package or article would produce much revenue.  In our opinion such a charge would lead to a great decrease in the use of cloak rooms, and that passengers would either take the risk of leaving goods on the platforms or would entrust them to porters,  We recommend, that the charges should be increased by 50$ and no more, and that no less deposit charge than 3d. shodld.be made per package or article.  The adoption of this recommendation will reduce the amount estimated as the produce Of the increases by  125,000,      Bicycles, Motor bicycles, Tricycles and other Special Articles by passenger Train.   In our opinion some of the proposed increases would fall very heavily upon the above named&quot;                                                          s articles by reason of the fact that during the War advances averaging 53$ had already been imposed upon these articles.
  The Cormpaniee-prtrpoaal &quot;to- Increase the chargea-:f or -the &apos;  carriage of these goods  by pa seenger--train over those-in   force on 14th January,&apos; 1920, to the extent of 75 per cent  would make the charges greater than the pre-war charges  by 167f  per cent.   We  asked the representatives of the  Railway Companies to consider these charges with a view  to  seeing whether they could net&apos;recommend some modification  of their proposals, particularly as regards short distances  so as to avoid the natural irritation which would be caused  by such -drastic increases.  &quot;They however did not see their  way to make any such recommendation.  We heard a representa*  tive of the National Cyclists Union, and we think that he  -  made out a good case in regard to bicycles for Seme considera-  tion.  We  accordingly recommend that the following scales shall  apply in lieu of those now in force.              s                           -Accompanied. &apos;        Unaccompanied. , Bicycles.           &apos; Pre-War&quot;*  Charge       Pre-war  Charge   -   &quot;   &apos; -  -             Charge,  recommended   Charge., recommend-                                by us.           &apos;      ed by us,                        0 .R j     -  0 ?R ,m     C ,R . : 0 .R ,n C .R ,  0 ,,R v  Not exceeding 12 miles  6d   .   l/-       1/-   9d   2/-   1/6&apos;  Prom 12 to 25 miles     6d      1/3       1/6  1/2   3/-   2/4  Prom 25 to 50, miles    l/-      2/-       2/-  1/6   4/-   3/-  Prorn 50 to-75 miles    1/6                3/-  2/3  Prom 75 to: 100 miles   2/-                4/*  S/-  Prom 50 to 100 miles            3/6                  7/-   5/6*  Prom 100 to 150 miles  2/6                5/-  3/9  Prom 150 to 200 miles  3/-                6/-  4/6  Prom 100 to 200 miles.           5/3                 10/6   7/9  For each additional  50 miles or part of                                        -  56 miles.               6d         9d      l/-   9d   2/-   1/6 - foilldrens Mall Carts  (folding)      Unaccompanied  -    fla accept the Companies&apos;! proposal  that &apos; as heretofore the  Parcels Rate should  apply.Accompanied. -   V&apos;e recommend tnat the rates in force before -

greater than 50 miles is not more than 5 miles ao^aoeountshould be taken of such excess e.g., any distance from 100to 105 miles phould be counted as 100 miles.   We believe thata sense of hardship in regard to trifling matters often causesas much or more irritation than a more serious grievance.     It will be seen that the above recommendations involve the.sacrifice of some of the revenue to be derived from the advancesproposed by tjie Railway Companies - namely       On coal a reduction of      66,000       On Manures    &quot;      M     321,000       On Returned Empties a           reduction of         1,100,572       On Bicycles &amp;c*             Unknown       Cloak room charges a           reduction of           125,000 1,612,572As above noted the estimate of the amount to be produced by allthe advances in rates recommended by the Railway Companies for passenger and Goods Trains and in Dock Dues and Charges is 54,730,000 so that with the reductions above mentioned the produce; of the increases will be, if the traffic Is maintained on the basis of the first six months of 1920 just over  53,000,000as compared with  53,500,000 required.   To make good this deficiency we recommend and advise that the flat rate increase -In respect of Goods in Class C should be 9d per ton in place.of 6d per ton proposed by the Railway Companies, this additionof 3d&apos;per ton will we are advised produce a sum of  454;500,and the total produce of the increases in rates for carriage ofGoods by Passenger and Merchandise trains will be, if the traffic is maintained on the present basis, as nearly as possible 53,500,000 which is the sum required.

 the cost per ton  of  shipping ooai in the- same&apos;iiyears will be  . found on page 294 of the  same print from which it appears that the  cost per ton  in  1913  wag 3.84 pence and in,-1^19-^12^75 pence-a-result ATbioh  i-s however,  to a great extent., due- Ur ohoJfixed-&apos;&quot; charges having  to be divided over the, smaller quantity of coal  :. shipped.      ,  Prom figures supplied to. us by the Ministry of Transport we&apos; learned  that the;  increase&apos; in- expenses in non-Railway owned Docks had been  very  great and an enquiry held by us into the position, of the Port of London  Authority before recommending that the&quot;London.Dues and  Charges should be increased, gave a similar result.  An  increase in the Rates and Dues  to be charged  - by that authority up to 15Q$ on Grain rates and 135$ generally ha.s been sanctioned.  .       We recommend and advise that the Railway Companies should be directed,-             *-   (a) to advance the Harbour Dues, Dock Dues on Ships, Goods       and  Passengers and the Wiarf and Pier Dues by 150$ over       the  Dues charged on  31st December 1913.  (This advance       is estimated  to produce  an increase over the revenue       received in 1919,  of  1,238,000).                      :,   (b) To advance the tonnage  charge for Tipping Coal and Coke  as       &apos;followsi-            South Wales and. Bristol Channel Ports.                On Coal and  Coke including weighing  to 1/3 per  ton.            &apos;3est  Coast and  Scottish Ports.                On Coal and  Coke exclusive of weighing to lOd. per ton          .  North East Coast and Number Ports.                On Coal exclusive of weighing to lOd, per ton.                On Coke exclusive of weighing to 1/3 per ton.          These advances  are estimated  to produce an increase          over  the revenue  received in  1919, of  1,272,000.   (c) To advance the cranage  charges in all cases  where they       have not already been so increased so as to  be 150$ above       the  charges made on  31st December;1913.       This advance  is estimated  to produce an  increase over the       revenue  received in  1919 of  10,(^00.          The  above  estimates  of the produce of the advances made do not.include  any allowance for the Porj-s  of  Southampton  or Hewhaven.   Similar Increases to those recommended  for  South ^ales and the Bristol Channel Ports  should be mfcde in those  ports and these we  are  informed will  produce  an increase  of  300,000.
 It should he noted that in some  oases  the  Railway owned Docks are In competition with hon Railway  Docks  where  the  rates and Dues  have nob hean.increased to  the  full  extent  above recommended, -  In uuoh cases the Railway OY/ned Docks should be permitted, subject to obtaining  your consent,  to charge the same rates as their competitors.           The total increases to be  obtained  from Railway  owned Docks Inclusive of Southampton and Newhaven,  if  our  recommend-- ations  are adopt 3d will be  2,820,000 provided no falling  off occurs  in .the business done.  as  300,000.of this Is expected from Southampton and  Wewbaven it will.be seen that,  drastic&apos;as.the  advances.recommended are, they do not  quite res lore the other Docks  to their  pre-war position of.earning  519,000 profit.                       -I(18)
                        IRELAND.    &apos; In your reference of 7th July, 1920 it is ste^edthat &quot;the&apos;Committee are asked to treat the Irish Railway Companies as aseparate unit, and the deficiency in respect of those railwaysmay be assumed at the rate of  2,200,000 per annum,&quot; -  Furtherit Is said &quot;As regards Ireland, the Minister will be glad if theCommittee will consider in particular what increases should be dlrected to be charged by the Great Southern and Western RailwayCompany whose rates were not subject to the percentage increaseadded to other Irish Railway rates in 1913 and 1916&quot;.   the increases referred to were A% in 1313 and 10$ in 1916 on therates, tolls and charges for the carriage of goods.     Mr*Edward Ad&amp;Ison Neale, the General Manager of the GreatSouthern and Western Railway&quot; of Ireland, gave evidence before:us on the 15th July, 1920 and laid before us the following estimate;taking the figure of  2,200,000 mentioned in the reference&apos;as the.deficiency for one year he computed-that-.the,Jieficiency for15 months (i.e. 1st April 1920 to 30th June 1921) would be 2,750,000 and that to collect that sum-in^Jl^months-(i,e* from 1st-August: 1920 to 30th JunefI921)  it would be necessary to charge rates and fares of such an amount-as-^would produce 3,000,000 in a year.   By reason of the time for making good the deficiency being extended to 31st July, 1921 and the impossibility of imposing the new goods rates before 1st September 1920, thequestion sc far as goods rates are  concerned becomes one of ralsimg,the deficiency for 16 months  (i*e..  from  1st April  1920,.to 31stJuly  1921) which till be  2,934^,000 in 11 months  (i*e, from 1stSeptember 1920 to 31st  July,  1921)  so that it will be necessary to charge for those 11 months  such rates and fares as would produce.a little over  3,200,000 in a year.      Mr. Neale put forward  a proposal on behalf of the  IrishRailway  Companies as  follows                            (19)
     To increase passenger Pares so as  to be 100 per cent  abovethe pre-war fares which.

 anticipated  that  a falling-off  of Traffio &quot;would&apos; take--place,. and wo are  satisfied  that it  is necessary  to  impose rotes  and  fares  as high as  those  propcsed by  Mr. Keale to.secure  the necessary amount to make good  the deficiency  at  the rate of  2,800*000  per annum which  would accrue between  1st April  1920 and 31st  July 1921 if-  the  increases  were.not  made.      The Irish Railway Companies1 proposals as regards  merchandise, minerals and live,stock were that increases should  be made over the  rates  in. force on  the  14th  January 1920 as follows  and it was  estimated  that without allowing for any falling off in traffic- the  proposed increases would produce the suras  set out below   I  - 4                      f                                Proposed increase.

Before the war the wages of railway men were substantially lower in Ireland than in England or Scotland,  they have, however, been brought up so as to be on a level  or nearly on a level with those now in force in Great Britain which have
themselves been greatly increased.) .  To enable the IrishRailways to meet their increased expenditure&apos;, Irish railway traffic has therefore, to bear a greater proportionate Increasein fares and rates than on this side of the Channel,&apos;   We donot see any monj*s of avoiding the increases,.ln Rates recommendedby the Irish Railway Companies and as the same necessity exists in Ireland as In Great Britain of putting the railways on aneconomically sound basis we recommend and advise that the proposalsof the Irish Railway Companies be adopted with the qualificationshereafter mentioned.   No witness appeared before us whosuggested any alternative means of raising the moneys required, :although Mr. William Hewart the only witness who, appeared from Irelandsuggested that some part of the deficiency should&apos; be allowed to fall on great Britain&apos;,   The Department of Agriculture and TechnicalInstruction for Ireland wrote under date 17th July 1920, complain-ing of the burden of Railway and Shipping rates on Agriculture,particularly instancing Butter, Eggs, Potatoes, Live Stofck,Manures and Agricultural Machinery, but made no suggestion as to how any deficiency arising from concessions made to agriculture could be made good.   We are in doubt whetherthe general increases we have recommended, large as they are.will prpy&amp;de the moneys necessary to make good the deficiency  .in Ireland and we do not see our way to recommend any smallerincreases nop do we think that any part of such increase canbe taken off agricultural traffic and imposed upon any otherTraffic, with the exception that we recommend that a similarconcession should be made in Ireland as regards manures to that madein England viz- that the, percentage increase should be half thatImposed generally i.e. 60$ instead of 120$.     We would;- however, qualify the proposals put forward by theIrish Companies in  the following particulars,.being of opinion thatthe increases proposed are so great that they would destroy the source of revenue and produce less money than smaller increases.
     Cloak Room Charges:-   we think that to double the charges and fix a minimum of 4d. per parcel would &quot;prevent use being madeof the Cloak Rooms and we recommend that the Charge a.,ahcaiM-cnilybe Increased by 50$ with a minimum of 3d*     Returned Empties.   We recommend that the same principle should be.adopted as tin Great Britain and the increase bothof Passenger and Goods train should be only 120$i     Great Southern and Western, Railway.   By reason of the termsof the Acts authorising, the Amalgamation of the various RailwayCompanies which now constitute the Great Southern and WesternRailway Company it was found impossible to impose the Increaseof 4$ under the 1913 Act which followed the Railway Strike of 1911or the increase of 10$ which was imposed in 1918 on the goodsrates of other Companies in Ireland,   We recommend and advise that increases similar to those Imposed in the case of the other companies should be put upon the Rates of the Great Southern and western Railway, so that first an increase of 4% should be made,subjeot to,any statutory maxima restricting the increase otherthan those contained in the Amalgamation Acts and upon the resulting,rates an increase of 10$ should be made subject to the samelimitation as to Statutory maxima.   The percentage increases proposed by the Irish Railway Companies (with the qualifications.mentioned above) should be added upon the footing that these increases have previously been made.    . Book, and Cranage Charges.   Mr. Neale on behalf of the MidlandGreat Western Railway Company of Ireland Informed us that theSpencer Dock belonging to that Company is the only Irish Railwayowned Dock, and that the business done there is very small, the gross revenue being in 1919, only  3,409 and the total expenditure 3,492,   He expressed the opinion that any increase in the DockCharges would result in the Railway Company Itfsing even the smallbusiness they now have.   We do&apos;not recommend any increase inthese charges.     The Great Southern and Western Railway Company have a harbour at Rosslare where certain Harbour dues are charged.   We recommend                          (23)
that thia Company should be directed to Increase these harbourdues by 60$ as has been done In other neighbouring harbours *     The amount produced by the increase will be small.     The Irish Railway Companies work cranes on the quays of the docks and Harbours at Dublin, Cork and Waterford.   The maximumCranage allowed by statute at Waterford is 2d. per ton, nomaximum is imposed on the Railway Companies for this service atDublin or Cork.   figures were given to us showing that owingto the large increases in wages this service was rendered in eachcase at a substantial loss (See page 112 Statement P print ofevidence 15th July 1920).   We recommend that the Railway companies should be directed to charge 10d. per ton for cranage.   Theamount to be realised by such increase would, we are informed be 12,649 per annum.     At North Wall, Coal in wagons is weighed at a charge of id.per ton.   The weighing Is a double process, the wagons are weighedwhen empty and the loaded wagons are subsequently weighed.   Werecommend that the Companies should be directed to charge for this service Id per ton.   The amount to be realised by such increasein charge would, we are informed, be  450 per annum.                         ChOSS OSftJiNBL TbAPFIC.     The increases which we have recommended in regard to therates to be charged for the carriage of passengers and goods inGreat Britain and in Ireland will apply to through traffic, but certain special provisions are necessary by reason of these increasesnot being uniform in the two countries and other special olreurnstaneea     We accordingly make the following recommendations (a) Suohof the through rates between Great Britain and Ireland as were not increased by 4 per cont in 1913 should now be increased by that amount subject to the Statutory Maximaa (b)  In addition such of the said through rates as were notsubjected to the general increases of 10 per cent made in ireland in 1916 on the Irish proportion of such rates should now be advanced so far as regards such Irish proportion by amounts
re presenting that- prO&quot;po:c1^m-. jxOx^eet-^                      .  (o) She through rates between Great Britain and Ireland in-operation on the 14th January 1920 as adjusted by the two increases last above mentioned, should now be advanced, by the percentages recommendedby us in regard to the Railways of Great Britain.  (d) To bring into operation increases which will represent theincreased percentages upon the Irish proportion of the through ratesthere should be added to eaoh through rate between Great Britainand Ireland computed as set forth in the last three subparagraphathe further amounts mentioned below:-       or distances in Ireland from the nearest Irish port bywhich through rates apply:  .

Steamship Surcharges.  During the war to enable the shipping companies independent of the Railways to continue their services,various surcharges were authorised mainly by the Board of Tradeunder the Defence of the Realm Act.   These Shipping Companiesreceived an agreed proportion of the through rates and thereforeparticipate in the increase of such rates directed by the Ministerof Transport.   In our recommendation of the 16th December 1919we advised that upon the new rates then recommended coming intoforce the Surcharges in question should be reduced and should thereafter be    On Goods and Liinerals.                       &apos;  10/- per ton.    On Horses and Mules.                           10/- per head.
     On Cattle and Calves..               5/- per head%     On Pigs, Sheep and Goats.           2/- per head     On Lambs and other small animals,   l/-. per head     Effect was given to this-recommendation in the directionissued by you.     Evidence was given to us that the Increase in the  expensesof carrying Goods by Sea across the Irish Channel since the15th January 1920 is hot less thanio/6 per ton of cargo carried,and that even when in receipt of the surcharges at presentIn force and their share of the increased through rates shipping companies will suffer loss - we accept this evidence and recommend&apos; that the surcharges at present allowed should becontinued.   The representative of the Belfast Steamship. Company(Mr. James McDowell) told us that in his opinion a surcharge of13/- per ton would be justified^,                            Existing Contracts.,     In our recommendation to you dated the 16th December, 1919,we dealt with the position in regard to existing contracts andadvised that no distinction should be made in the case of personshaving special agreements with Railway Companies whether embodied in Acts of Parliament or not*   The matter wag ag&amp;ln broughtto our notice In the present enquiry by Mr. John Henry. Cockburn,Solicitor to the Staveley Coal and Iron Company Ltd0, who called attention to the Agreement of 29th November 1866 between that company and the Midland Railway Company which stipulated thatfor the carriage of all goods and minerals upon certain railwaysagreed to be purchased by the Railway Company., being railwaysconnecting the collieries of the Staveley Company with theirworks, the Staveley Company should pay for every journey atthe rate of l d0- per ton.   He also told us that his Company aremaking claims under Section 3 of the Ministry of Transport Act1919 in respect of the increase in rates                                                         made/
^                           * 27  m        made  aa  from the  15th January 1920,   We are of opinion and        advise  that  on the present occasion also no distinction should        he made  between persons having such special contracts and        others,  but  thai  they should be left to such remedy (if any)        as they  have under Section 3 of the said Act.(27)
                  &apos;   gCEPffiAL. i RATES,    -          The tjueirtlon pf these rates rhaa caused USf great&quot; dlf iciiUy\Before the war there was and always had been actual ^competition between the Railways and both the Coastwise Steamers and Canalboats to secure traffic and there can be no doubt that on each side rates were reduced with this object.   We see n&amp; ground forcondemning either party for adopting this course.   Healthycompetition is not to be deprecated and Is in the interests Qfthe Trader.   We do not think it necessary to consider whether insome cases rates may not have been fixed teo low in the desire tosecure traffic for we are of epinien that taken as a whole thecompetitien was legitimate, and if the same circumstances are againfound to exist we do not think that the Railways should be forbidden to reduce their rates when necessary to secure a fair share of the traffic;  and we recognise that the traffic which may become thesubject of legitimate competition is not only that from port topert or frem Canal Wharf to Canal Wharf, but also that from placesnear to ports which are affected by the possibility of a shc*rt trafficby rail or read and a long traffic by sea.          Since the War the relative conditions have greatly changed.The expenses of operating the railways have greatly increased, but 1the expenses of conveying goods by water have increased in a muchgreater proportion.   The traffic by sea has not only b&amp; bearincreased expenses in respect of seamen^ wages and coal and of thecost of loading and unloading, but pert and harbour dues both inrespect of goods and ships have gone up very greatly and the charges for delivery to and frem the wharf are disproportionately largecompared with those formerly in ferce.   The cost of carriage by canalhas also been very seriously affected both by the fact that theincrease in wages falls more hemrily en a traffic in whicli the numberof tons conveyed is small compared with the number of men employed,and by the fact that the shorter hours worked by the bargemen                            (*8)
nearly  If not  quite  double  the  length of time.occupied in the transit.,                                                   j     Up to  the  15th  January,  1920 there  had been no increase  in therates for t&amp;e  *iarriage  of goods by rail  and the  Railway aaapanieswere in effect  subsidised by  the  guaraLjtee  of.the Government.;  trafficcarried coastwise had the benefit of a oertain subsidy up to  the50th June,  1920, but we do.  not  think it  necessary to discuss  th*state of affairs during those periods  for we are concerned only with the period after 1st September 1920, when it is proposed  thatthe rates for carriage  of goods by rail  shall be Increased to  theextent  referred to in other parts of this report?     Upon the question  whether  when the  Railway&apos;  rates  have been increased by the General percentage, here&apos; recommended  the coastwisesteamers will be able to attract  a fair  share of traffic at freightswhich will  enable them  to continue to  compete, we have come to tJheconclusion  upon the  evidence  that with few  exceptions  they will not beable to do  so.     We are.. therefore of opinion  that  it is desirable  with a vdewto securing the continuance of  the (Coasting Trade that if ratesoan be  shown.to have been reduced to meet water  competition theyshould be &quot;restored to a normal&apos;  amount, but  we regret  that we do not.see in  what manner this can be  done at the  present moment.     toe whole  position of  exceptional rates requires review?   Theyhave grown up in an  accidental  manner  without system  of principle,,in many cases the whole of  the  reduction and in  many  other casespart of the reduction in the  rate is  justified by. a difference inthe conditions  attached eeg0  vfhej?e the class rate includes collection-and delivery and the exceptional  rate  is station to. station, so  muchof the  reduction as  represents-cartage &quot;is necessarily  justi:liedJ*Where the class rate is  for &quot;any  weight&apos;f and the exceptional rateIs for  consignments  of  2 tons or  4 tons  a percentage  reduction isproper  and  where even greater quantities are a condition of the exceptional.rate a/yet-greater  percentage reduction would                            (29)
   naturally  follow.    In many oases more  than owe.-condition la   attached to the  exceptional rate. e*g*  where it la  granted only   for large  quantities,from station to  station and at owner*s risk   as  against a class  rate for any weight, collected and delivered  at   Company^  risk;  hit in many cases the  reductions vary though the   conditions are the  same,        A considerabJie ammber of exceptional  rates taken at chance   from  $he  rate books were submitted to  us  and gave  instances  of  the   varying rates.   These showed that no principle could be deduced   from the examples given.        The following  are oases where the  conditions were identical:-    0   Birmingham to Hull.    Peat Mosa Litter.       Exceptional    Brass.                      w    Brass Scrap.                 H   Liverpool  to Glasgowi          w    Wools preas packed.    .  Exceptional    Wool: not press packed,  .

It is impossible te pick out from instances like these anyproportion or percentage of  the reduction and say that it inattributable to water eempetition.     The total number ef exceptional rates on the Kate Books of^e Hallway Companies amounts to many millions, and any investigation of the individual rates Is obviously Impossible,   It would notbe right te abolish ajl such rates particularly where they are based on differing conditions.   Many have been in existence a very long time and bus inesaw have  in some cases been established or extended upon the faith of ihem.   Both Hallway Companies and traders took strong objection to any sweeping changes, and inparticular there la general  agreement that reductions in the caseof goods for export should be retained but that in the eaae ofimports they should be forbidden.   We are of opinion, however,that the1 whole of the exceptional rates should be over-hauled andsystematised and we think the general principles should be somewhatto the following effect:-     (a)   Where a class rate is at Company&apos;s risk and an exceptional            rate la at Owner&apos;a Risk such percentage reduction (if any)            as may be justified by the nature of the risk, should be            authorised.     (b)   Where the exceptional rate Is for large quantities a            percentage reduction according to the quantity may         I            properly be adopted, but we think that except in the          &apos;  case of light articles such as haf &amp; straw a lot of 2 tens I            is not entitled  to any great consideration.     When the rates are finally revised it may well be that thenecessity for these exception? will be.disposed of by the inclusion in the classification bf&apos; way of Tariffs or otherwise of conditionswhich will cover thef cases.Lfnden to^ BrIatgA.  Sugar in 2 ton lets,         * 5 ton  *         *10 ten  &quot;
          At the same time we recognise that there are semecircumjstanoas which may upon occasion justify an exceptional ratenot dependent ujboh the conditions above referred to.          We advise that the course te be adapted should be to request the Hallway Companies to submit a definite Scheme for bringing the exceptional rated up to a standard based en the aboveprinciples with such facts and Illustrations as are necessary ferelucidating it as seon as the first stage in the general enquiry into rates is concluded and that this should take precedence of the stage s)f our enquiry which deals with classification.   We cannothope that this examination of exceptional rates can be completedwithout a considerable delay, but we think that it should beundertaken as seon as possible and that It will assist us in theadoption of tariffs such as have been proposed when we resume out enquiry as to the principles for the permanent revision of ratesafter the vacation.
                    G EN E R&apos;A Li          The above recommendations provide for the raising ineleven months (ifte* between&apos;1st September 1920 and 3.1st July1921) of the deficiency which but for the&apos;increase - in rates nowproposed, would have accrued in sixteen months (i.e* between 1st April 1920 and 31st July 1921).  &apos; At the expiration of thatperiod it will only be nftsessary to raise In each year theamount of revenue required to prfnrlde the outgoings of that year,and it is to be hoped that as from the 1st August 1921 it willbe possible to reduce the rates which will have been in forcein the intervening peried, a matter living considerable importanceseeing that in accordance, with the terms of the Ministry ofTransport, Act 1919 the peried. of Gevernment possession of thefcailways: will expire on the 15th August 1921, but the TMlwayCompanies will be entitled te charge the rates, fares, tolls, duesand other, charges directed toy the Minister of Transport for afurther period *f eighteen menths.   In our recommendations we feel that we have dealt lightly with Passenger Pares aa compared,!with Goods hates, and subject to anything which may occur inthe meantime we think that goods rates will have a special claim  1to consideration when the time.for readjustment comes next year.            We wish also to call attention to the fact that manyof. those who appeared before us at the public enquiry put forwardclaims or requests for specially favourable treatment on grounds which had no.connection with  the problem of transport by rail.Thus the Lwiden.County Council asked for assistance in dealingwith their housing problem, the Seoretary of the AdvisoryCommittee for Juvenile Employment, of  the Ministry of Labour,  askedfor.concessions for  those In  whose welfare  she was interested.the representative of the Trade Union  Parliamentary Comm.&quot;.tv53pressed  that workmen should be carried at fares  whi-tii  involve
the Rail&apos;.?aye In loss.   While we eannet day that we entirelyclosed our eyes to outside considerations we are strongly andunanimeusly of opinion that each department ef State shouldmake aueh provision as may be netessary for those with whom it is oencowwd and that the Transpert industry should not becalled upon to bear the burden of providing at its own expensefor the needs of other branches of industry or other Sectionsof the community?   There is no good reason why the passengers and Traders of the United Kingdom or the Shareholders in theHallway Companies should pay for grants to the dwellers in and around London or should be chosen to subsidise education orotherwise take upon themselves burdens which are sometimeslocal and sometimes should fall upon the whole community*50th July 1920.           &quot;             P.
