N :[This Document Is the Property of His  Brltannio Majesty&apos;s Government, and thould        be returned to the Foreign Office If not required for official use.]155/CP.   1739  ho     FRANCE AND POLAND.     Mo de Fleuriau called at the Foreign Ctffice this afternoon with instructions from M* Millerand to submit,without delay,  four propositions to the  British Governmentrelating to the Polish crisis*   They were as follows:-     (1) That the Allenstein and Marienwerder troops should not be withdrawn.  Upon this Mo  de Fleuriau  was told that instructions had already been sent  (upon theadvice of Lord D&apos;Abernon and the War Office)  for thewithdrawal of the Irish battalion from  Allenstein.     (Z) That the Allied troops at Teschen shouldbe transferred as soon as available to  Oppeln.  As  these troops are French and Italian,  no British forces beinginvolved,  there seems to be no objection.     (3) That the British and French Ministers  atPrague and Bucharest should be instructed to  represent the urgency of hurrying on the defensive measures already  in contemplation by those Governments.   There seems to be  noobjection.     (4).That General Wrargel, who has  declared hisreadiness to start a fresh offensive,   should he assisted..by the supply of arms and munitions. The-  French Goverrmentare ready to do this and ask the British-Government tofollow suit.  This involves a direct negation of the policyhitherto pursued by Kis Majesty&apos;s Government.(Initialled)-  Co of K.FOREIGN OFFICE,August 5th, 1920.
