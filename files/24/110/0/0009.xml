is,  the Piopferty  of 2 7 This  Oo(-i&apos;W,iiJjjjp o.;&apos;,., ;.r.    -.:-o&apos;.y&apos;o Government.ON!ti  Restoration  of  Order  in  Ireland  Bill.HAL         &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;-                      MEMORANDUM.     The general  scheme  of  this Bill is that it authorises His Majesty in Council to issue regulations &quot;for securing the restora- tion and maintenance of order in Ireland,&quot;     Under  this power regulations can be made covering  a very wide field, similar to the field covered by the  regulations  made under the Defence of the Realm Act, whose scope was defined as regulations &quot;for securing the public safety and the defence of the realm&quot;  The regulations made  under  the present  Bill will operate under the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act, 1914, and may be made so as to apply generally to  the whole of Ireland or to any part thereof, and  indefinitely in point of time.     Express power is given  to make regulations  for particular purposes  included  in  the above  general purpose,  the particular purposes  being  those  to  effect  which  immediate  action  is desired.     Purpose 1. Subsection  (2).  To enable  persons  committing crimes in Ireland to be tried and dealt  with  in  the same way as  persons  committing  offences against  the  Defence of  the Realm Regulations,  i.e.,   by  courts - martial   or  courts  of summary jurisdiction.  Two  qualifications  are attached to this, power:     (a) The crime  is to  be punishable by the  same punish^ ment  as  may be inflicted  under  the   ordinary  law:  thus treason and murder would be punishable with death.  Offences against  the  regulations  at present  are  punishable by  penal servitude or any  lesser punishment,  and it  is  at  the discretion of the court-martial to determine the degree of punishment.  A court-martial cannot at  present  inflict the punishment of death unless it is  proved that the offence was  committed with the intention of assisting the enemy.  /   .      (6) The  court-martial when trying a  capital  charge is to include as a member of  the  court one person (who may but need not be a civilian) of legal knowledge and experience,      Purpose 2.-Subsection (3) (a).. To provide  that courts of summary  jurisdiction outside the   Dublin  metropolitan  police district  when trying  ordinary  crimes  or  offences  against  the      221-2                   a
                                 (  2  )                                   v      &apos;      regulations, and courts of quarter sessions when  hearing appeals,     are to he specially  constituted, i,e.,  are  to consist respectively of     two or more resident magistrates or the county court judge sitting     without any unpaid magistrates.          Purpose 3.-Subsection (3) (6).  To give the courts-martial     powers  which justices possess for requiring persons  to enter into&apos; ^   recognisances to keep the peace or  be  of  good behaviour, and to     estreat and enforce  these recognisances;  also powers of compelling     witnesses  to attend  and give evidence.  These additional powers     have  been asked for by Sir Nevil Macready.         Purpose 4t. Subsection (3) (c).  To transfer to military courts     of  inquiry the  powers  of coroners  and  coroners&apos;  juries.  This     power has been asked for  by the Irish Government.         Purpose 5. Subsection (3)  (c).  To  enable  provision  to be     made for  the holding  of  civil  courts when the court houses have     been   destroyed-a  not  uncommon   occurrence.   Under  the     existing law  the  courts  must  be held  in  some  cases  in  a     particular  court house or within  a  particular  area, and  these     requirements cannot always be fulfilled in present circumstances.         Purpose  5. Subsection  (3)  id).   To  enable  recalcitrant     local  authorities to  be dealt with by withholding public grants     which  otherwise would  be payable to the  authorities, and  for     the application  of  the same in discharge  of the  local author ity&apos;s     liabilities; i.e., this would  enable provision  to be made  for  the     payment  thereout  of compensation awards  or  of  salaries  and     pensions of officers of the  local authority, if so desired.          There is a precedent for  discharging  liabilities  of  local     authorities out of public grants payable to  them, viz., section 80      (2) of  the Local  Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, under which      debts due to the Crown  or any Government  department may be      deducted from  any payments  to a  local authority out of  the      Local Taxation (Ireland) Account.  Public  grants  forming part      of  the  Guarantee Fund under the Land  Purchase Acts can  also      be diverted from the local authorities in order to meet liabilities      arising under those Acts,           Subsection (6),   This subsection defines &quot; crime &quot; as meaning,      in effect, any offence against the ordinary  law.   A distinction is      drawn  by the Bill between  crimes (i.e., the  crimes under  the      ordinary  law)  and  offences under  the  regulations,  whether      existing defence of  the  realm  regulations  or regulations made      under the Bill,
    With respect to crimes the Bill effects two objects: it makesthem  cognisable by  courts-martial  and  preserves  the  existingscales of punishment.    On the other hand, offences under the regulations are with-out special provision triable by  court-martial and subject to the penalties  fixed  by the  Defence of  the Bealm  Acts, i.e.,  penal servitude  for life, or, if dealt  with summarily, imprisonment for six months or  a fine of 100L, or both.
