THIS DOCOMOT Iff. THE. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET,CP, 1703,CABINET.IRISH SITUATION COMMITTEE,NOTE BY MR.LONG,      The Irish Situation Committee held its Fifth meeting to-day and arrived unanimously at the following conclusions,T/hich they recommend to the earnest consideration of theCabinet -(1)    USE OF ULSTER VOLUNTEERS.          In view of the urgent  need of concentrating      all available troops the Committee feel that      advantage ought to be taken of the willingness.      of the North to protect themselves and steps      taken at once to enlist volunteers on a special      constabulary basis.   The  Committee consider,      however, that this force should not be used      outside Ulster.(2)    SPECIAL FORCE OF EX-OFFICERS.          General Tudor in his statement to the Cabinet      on Friday last stated that the special force of      ex-officers which had been recruited and. used      for strengthening the R.I.C, had done much to      raise its morale.   The Committee urge that steps      should be taken to accelerate the recruitment      of these ex-officers.(3)    AUTHORITY OF PERSONS SERVING THE IRISH GOVERNMENT.          The Committee feel that no person serving under      the Irish Government should in any circumstances be      permitted to hold communication with Sinn Fein,      except on the basis of the government&apos;s expressed      policy, viz: the repression of crime and the      determination to carry through the Government of      Ireland Bill on its present main lines.W    POSITION OF COASTGUARDSMEN.-    The Committee are of opinion that the presentposition of the coastguardsmen in Ireland demandsthe. immediate attention of the Cabinet..(Initialled)    W.H.L.July 29th, 1920*
