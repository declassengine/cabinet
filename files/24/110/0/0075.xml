Earl Gurzon to the Earl of Derby (Paris).(No. 2758.)                           .My Lord,                                        Foreign Office, August 13, 1920.     THIS morning I asked M. de Fleuriau to  call upon  me  to  receive the views ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Government on  the unfortunate situation that  had arisen from  the recognition by the French  Government of General Wrangefs Government, and fromthe advice ,which His Majesty&apos;s Government had given to the Polish Government.     I said that an explanation of the French view of these proceedings had been givenby M. Paleologue to the British Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires in Paris, arid had been communicatedto us.  It now behoved  me to place before  M. de Fleuriau the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the same  situation in  reply to  the official notification which he had made to me the day before.     I began by reminding him of the conditions under which we  had first  heard ofthe  step taken  by the French Government.    When  the announcement appeared in the &quot;Westminster  Gazette&quot; last  Tuesday  afternoon (10th August), not havingreceived  any  official  notification  from   the  French  Government, I had  declined to believe  for  a moment  that  it was true,  but had telephoned  at once to  theFrench  Embassy  and  to Paris  for  information.   M.  de  Fleuriau  himself  had replied that he  knew  nothing  about  it.   An  hour  later  the   Prime Minister,  whowas equally incredulous, had made a statement in the House of Commons that it seemedto him inconceivable that M. Millerand could have taken such a step without previous consultation with the Allies.  The view had even been suggested  that  the  declarationmight  have  emanated  from the  French Foreign Office in the absence, and  withoutthe knowledge, of M. Millerand.   Both  of these hypotheses,  however,  had turned out to be erroneous.  It had since transpired that the decision with  regard  to  general wrangel&apos; had  been  arrived at  by the French Cabinet  at  a  meeting  over which m. Millerand himself had presided.  Both the act itself and the public announcementof  it without any communication to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  were thereforedeliberate proceedings on the part of the French Government.   M. de Fleuriau could notbe unaware of the painful impression that had been  produced in  this country  by  that procedure, and it would be my duty presently to explain to him the  serious  view takenby the British Cabinet of the incident, and  the unfortunate effect  that it could scarcely&apos;fail to have upon both the present exceedingly critical situation and  upon the future olthat close co-operation between France  and ourselves on  which  the peace of Europedepended.                            ,     Before going on to this, however, I wished to offer a* word  of  explanation as to thecircumstances in which I had sent off  the telegram of advice to the  Polish Governmentupon the terms of peace offered to them by the Soviet authorities, to which I understood from Paris that  the French Government took  such serious exception.  .0n the same afternoon to  which I had  already referred, M* Kamenef had handed  to  the BritishGovernment a statement of those terms.  The debate in the House of Commons  had shown conclusively that the  opinion of every section  in  Parliament,  and  not of theLabour section.only, was resolutely opposed to any resumption of war, and that it wouldbe with  the  utmost difficulty,  and only  in case the terms  proposed to  the EolishGovernment were absolutely impossible, that, the consent of Parliament and  of publicopinion in this country oould be obtained for even the limited  measure of assistance tothe Poles which had been formulated at Lympne. The fundamental  principle laid down at Lympne had been that we must secure for Poland her legitimate independence withinher ethnographic frontiers.  As  soon, therefore, as it appeared to the  British Govern-ment that this condition was broadly conceded by the proposed  terms, and as it was clear to the Cabinet  that  if they were rejected in limine it would be impossible tosecure the assent of the British Parliament to the contemplated  operations, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, knowing that the Polish  delegates were to  meet the Russian delegatesthe next day, and feeling apprehensive that, relying upon the support of Great Britain       [4084.71-.1]u
and  France, they  might reject the proposals in toto, felt it only fair to, acquaint thePolish Government with the British view of the facts of the case.     I then read to M. de Fleuriau the exact terms of our communication to Warsaw,namely: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s  Government  are of opinion that, provided these terms arebond fide offered at Minsk, and  that no  substantial addition  is made  to them, theywould appear  to leave the independence of Poland within her ethnographic frontiersunimpaired.  The  Polish Government will, of course, carefully examine these conditions,and  will be at liberty to secure by negotiation better terms if  they can.  The BritishGovernment could not assume the responsibility of taking hostile action  against Russiaif the conditions now offered, in their  general substance, were refused.&quot;     This advice, I pointed out to him, did not presume the acceptance of  the whole ofthe terms by ourselves, still less a suggestion to the Polish Government that they should accept them en bloc.   Several  of them were of a character that would  demand the closest scrutiny, and probably substantial  amendment; but we  did not think that, as abasis of negotiation, they  should be rejected without qualification at the  start.  Thiswas  the advice that we considered ourselves entitled to give to  the. Polish  Governmenton our own account. The French Government were equally entitled to give their advice,and  I should not have  complained of  any such counsel tendered by them, provided itwas  consistent with the conclusions arrived at at Lympne.. Indeed, in telegraphing toWarsawr, we had shown our good faith by at once informing Paris of what we had done.and  inviting their co-operation.     Thus there were these differences between the proceedings of the two Governments :We  had given confidential advice on our own account to the Polish. Government.  Thiswas  private advice, not intended to he published  to the world.   Publicity  had, indeed,been given to it, not by any action of our own, but by the unauthorised action of theFrench Government in Paris.  Further, we had communicated the  advice  to&apos; our  Ally,and,  whether  the  advice  was wise  or unwise,  at any  rate our procedure had  beencorrect.     On  the  other  hand, what  had  the  French  procedure  been?  In  the recent discussions at Lympne, the name  of General Wrangel had, indeed, been mentioned.  Ithad  been recognised that the relations of our two Governments to that General and hisforce were rather different, because, owing to our negotiations with the Soviet authorities onhis behalf, we had  for some time been disabled from giving him any more assistance,while  the French  Government  had  been under no such restriction.   Consequently, itwas  agreed that if the negotiations between Poland and  Russia broke down, but onlyin that case, one of the forms of assistance that the Allied Governments were preparedto give would be support to General WrangeFs army; and this support, it was agreed,had  better,  for the reasons  I had named, be  given  by the  French rather than by ourselves.  Such was the sole reference that had  been  made  at Lympne to&apos; general wrangel.  No mention of recognition, no hint that it was in the minds of the French,no indication  that  they were awaiting assurances from him upon the receipt of whichthey would be called upon to decide concerning the grant of recognition had been givenby the French Prime Minister.  The British delegates returned from Lympne with the firm conviction that the Wrangel  question could not and would not be raised till after theissue of the negotiations at Minsk was known.   Nevertheless, it now appeared that, onthe  morning after his return to Paris,  M. Millerand had presided over a Cabinet meetingat which the assurances sought from General Wrangel had been received and accepted.It had thereupon been decided to give de facto recognition to the Government  of thatofficer.  The  British  Government were not consulted in any  degree as  to this step,and  they first heard of it, not in an  official communication, but in the columns of thepress.     Such was the  difference between the actions of the two Governments, and such wasthe position concerning which  I sought an explanation from M. de Fleuriau.     The latter proceeded to dilate at some length upon  the French view of the termsof peace offered to the Polish Government, and of the  advice which we had  given tothat Government.   In the opinion of the French Government,  these terms were  quiteinconsistent with  the  independence of  Poland, and some of them were of a  characterthat the Poles could  not possibly be  expected  to accept.  The  Polish  government themselves evidently took a  similar view, because, although the French had not givenopposite advice to them,  and indeed had refrained  from giving  any  advice  at all,the attitude adopted in Warsaw sufficiently showed that the terms were  regarded bythe  Poles  as  wholly inadmissible, and as  hardly affording  a bassis  for reasonablenegotiation. &apos; Our  advice  had, in  fact, had the very opposite effect  to  that  intended.M. de Fleuriau could not help expressing his regret that we had though fit to tender it.
      The conversation on this point continued for some time, and appeared to absorb so much of the attention of M. de Fleuriau, that I at length enquired-putting aside the question of the terms and of the different views upon them entertained  by the different parties concerned what he had to say on behalf of his Government with regard to the Wrangel jincident, and how he  explained the various steps  which I had ventured to criticise.      M. de Fleuriau had already observed that the form and the manner of the  French decision seemed to him an unfortunate &quot; gaffe &quot; ;  and that, if it had occurred a fortnight earlier, before the  Lympne Conference, none of this trouble need have arisen.      I replied that I fully agreed,  but that  what  I sought was his opinion upon  the case now,  and his explanation of the  steps that had been taken in Paris  within the past few  days.                                                                       &quot;  ,      Upon this M. de Fleuriau, after observing silence for some time, begged me not to place him  in a painfully embarrassing position.   He asked for my consideration  in  not pursuing the subject.      It was only too obvious from this attitude that he had no defence to offer, and that loyalty  to his  Government  restrained him from expressing  his own  opinion on  the matter.      I then passed on to explain to him our  view of the  wider consequences of  the act.      In the  first place,  it was  necessary  that  I should point out to him that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  could accept  no  responsibility whatever for the action  of  the French Government.   If the latter had chosen to recognise the Government of General Wrangel they had done so on their own account, and they could expect no  reciprocity from us.   We were not going to be tempted by their action to deviate  from  our own policy, either with regard to General Wrangel or with regard to the Polish peace  terms. Our  decision upon the latter, whenever it had  to be taken, would be guided by the views which  had already been expressed  by the Prime &quot;Minister in Parliament, and accepted by public opinion here, without reference to the intermediate and independent action which the French Government had chosen to take.      But, I asked, had the French  Government seriously considered the effect that  this divergence of policy  must have ?   The  Polish Government, for instance, already not overpleased with the advice given  to them  by the British Government, and conscious that  the French Government were now behind them, would enter into negotiations in a spirit very different  from that which we  both  desired.   In consequence, it was more than probable that they would be wrecked altogether.   Thus, at the very moment when the  object of all  the Allies was  to secure peace,  and when the whole intention of the Lympne Conference had been to find a basis for peace, one of  the principal parties  was entering upon negotiations in a  mood the very reverse of peaceful, encouraged by the demonstrations  of the Great  Power  upon whom  that  party had  hitherto principally relied for advice and support.     Further, if the negotiations broke down. in consequence of the attitude  taken  up by the Poles, what would  be. the  situation in which  we should then find ourselves? Hitherto we  had contemplated that our joint support would be given to  the  Poles only upon a clear  issue and  under sharply defined conditions.  In no&apos; other circumstances would public opinion allow the British Government to take part in hostile measures. BUD now, if the negotiations broke  down, we might have the French Government,  owing to the view which they had taken, urging that a situation had arisen for the protection of Poland  by  arms and  for the  resumption of  war with Russia, while the British Government would be deterred, by their declarations and by the unmistakable attitude of public opinion,  from  giving any such  co-operation.   Could any worse position be contemplated ?     Again, the  recognition of General Wrangel must be considered in its effect upon the Soviet  Government at a moment when they were embarking upon negotiations and when peace  was presumably the  object of  all  parties.    At  this  very juncture  the French Government had gone out of their way to recognise the independent Government of an officer  in the  south of Russia, whom the Soviet authorities regarded  as  an enemy and a  usurper.  I pointed out that, even at the height of the success of Admiral Kolchak, when he held Siberia almost up to the Urals, he had not  been recognised  by the Allied  Powers, and even  if his recognition had been seriously  proposed it  would never have been given  and announced by one Power alone without consultation with the others.   At the height of the success  of General  Denikin, when  he was within200 miles of Moscow and held a  far larger portion  of Russia within his grasp than nowacknowledged the authority of General  Wrangejl, recognition had not  been given to       4084  R-I]                                                      B  2
him.   But now the French Government, at this  moment of all others, had  taken this step of granting recognition  to General Wrangel, and had taken it independently, inspite of the fact that it was tantamount to a declaration.of war against Soviet Russia,How could such a  step facilitate the progress of the Minsk negotiations?     Moreover, it  was necessary  to  look.yet a little  further afield.   Supposing that-owing-, to these events the negotiations at Minsk broke down altogether; supposing thatthe Russians, unable to come to terms with the Poles, overran the whole of Poland, and either set up  a Soviet  Government  there  or advanced their armies to the german frontier;  would not the very situation arise which France, even more than we ourselves,regarded  with the most dire  alarm, namely, that combination  between  Russia andGermany, which would be fatal at once to the hopes  of peace and to the execution of theTreaty of Versailles.     Such were the consequences,  quite apart from the effect upon the relations oi  our two  countries  or  Governments,  which  appeared  not  unlikely to  ensue  from  the unfortunate step that had been  taken in Paris.     At this  stage M. de Fleuriau interposed with the remark that he, at  any rate, was fully conscious ofthe^difficulties of the Parliamentary position here ; that he  thought the Prime Minister had made a very wise and skilful speech in the House of Commonslast Tuesday ; that he fully recognised that British  public opinion was entirely behind the Prime Minister, and would not consent to go beyond; and that he feared there wasa certain inability  on the part of the French Government and the  French temperamentto understand clearly our point  of view, just as in some respects  we might  not make full allowance for  the French  point of view.   He  even thought  that  French lack of understanding of the British standpoint was to some extent accountable for what had occurred.  He. certainly would not fail to inform his Government of  the serious natureof the  position as it was viewed  here.     Finally, 1 drew the attention of M. de Fleuriau to the fact  that this was  not  thefirst occasion in the last six months on which the French Government had, so to speak,taken  the bit between  their teeth, and started a policy of their own without any reference  to  their  Allies.  The same thing had happened in the case of the incidents inthe Ruhr  Valley, and the occupation by the French  of G&apos;erman  towns in the month ofMarch last.   On that occasion  the French Government had acted without consultationwith their Allies, and in definite opposition to the united views of the latter.  their action had given a seiious shake to the Entente..  So overwhelming, however, had beenthe feeling  in  this country  as to the  necessity  of unbroken co-operation that  the incident had been passed  over, and  some organs of the press, which were habituallyopposed to  the British  Prime Minister, had even defended the French point of view.But, on the present  occasion, M. de Fleuriau would have observed that the  press ofthis country was absolutely unanimous, and that  the action of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had been defended by no  one more strongly  than by the  newspapers  whichordinarily attacked the Prime Minister.   Five  months had not elapsed since the Ruhrincident, and we already had a repetition of the incident in a different part of the world,at a moment of far greater  gravity, and in circumstances which surely gave much lessexcuse. How could an alliance, upon the continuance  of which the peace  of Europedepended, and in the  necessity of which  no one believed  more strongly than we ourselves,  fail to be  affected by these reiterated  shocks ?  According to our view, theBritish Government were continuing along the same road which they had hitherto beentravelling  in  company with  the  French Government.  The  French Government hadchosen to  make a  divergence at a sharp tagent,  rendering it very difficult for them toreturn to  the road  along  which we were still moving.     In these circumstances I could not  help  emphasising to M. de  Fleuriau that  i thought an immediate  and serious explanation was due from his Government, both asto the. recent step which  they had taken  and as to their view of the possible con-sequences to which I had drawn attention.     M. de Fleuriau,  who had, I think, been a good deal affected by my remarks, andby my repeated asservation of the necessity of the  continued co-operation of our twoGovernments and  countries,  asked me  what  form  I thought the French explanationshould take ?     I  said at once that it was not for  me to give any opinion on this subject.  NoForeign Minister of one Government could suggest to the Foreign Minister  ot, anotherthat he should either  offer an apology or confess himself in the wrong.     M. de Fleuriau then asked  if I would give, unofficially and as a friend, the advice which  I had declined  to give  as Foreign Secretary ?                                  ;     Here, again, I felt  unable to assist him.   It  was  for the French. Government to
 say how far the action they had taken was irrevocable, or whether it could in any way be modified.  It was  for them to  offer any explanation or to express any regrets for the conduct which I had described.  The next move  must come from them.  I hoped that M. de Fleuriau would put before them a full report of the communication which it. had been my duty to make, and  of the very  serious  view taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government of  the incident in its widest aspect.     In the course of our  conversation M. de Fleuriau put to me one definite question which I have omitted  to notice in this record.  It was this :  In the event of the Polish Government  declining to  accept the  conditions which the  Soviet  Government had offered, and  of  a rupture  occurring in consequence,  did  I  mean  that His Majesty&apos;s Government would decline to offer any assistance to the Polish Government ?     To this I replied  that a definite answer to such a question  could not possibly be given until it was known what course the negotiations  had pursued  and what was  the issue on which they had broken down, if they did break down.  Of one thing, however, I was quite sure, and  that was that public opinion in this country would not tolerate our going one iota  beyond the point which the Prime Minister had indicated  in his speech last Tuesday, and that we should not be justified in embarking on hostilities for anything in  excess  of the limits agreed upon between the  French  Government and ourselves at Lympne, which the Prime Minister had explained in his  speech.   It would be holding out false hopes, both to  the  French Government and to the Polish Govern- ment, if I were  to encourage any contrary impression.     It is to be noted that, since placing on  record the above account of my conversa- tion with the French Minister, I  have received a telegram from Sir Horace Rumbold stating, in direct contradiction of the assurance which I have quoted as given to me by M. de Fleuriau, that the French Minister at Warsaw has  informed the Polish Govern- ment that the French Government  consider the Soviet proposals as totally inacceptable.                                             I am, &amp;c.                                                  CURZON OF  KEDLESTON.
