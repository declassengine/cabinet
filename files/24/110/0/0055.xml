7,8.23,198PART  I-THE   LABOUR   SITUATION. General Survey of the Week.    The situation in so far as industrial disputes are concerned continues to be quiet. A meeting of the Wool (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council is to be held on the 5th August to consider the wages claim which has been put forward by the operatives on the expiry of the previous agreement.  A meeting of engineering unions will be held in London on the 6th August to define their attitude towards the situation created by the last awards of the Industrial Court in the engineering and shipbuilding trades; the miners will hold a special delegate conference on the 12th August to decide the policy to be adopted in reply  to the Cabinet&apos;s refusal to entertain their  double demand for increased wages and reduced prices of coal.    The opinion is being expressed by many people that the early weeks of the autumn will witness an industrial crisis of considerable severity, in which wages disputes may be combined with extensive action against high  prices and increased rents.  On the other hand the preliminary warnings of a period of industrial depression to commence about the same  time  as the anticipated  industrial crisis are being extensively advertised and the industrial leaders of  labour, like the political  leaders, are adopting  a restrained and conservative attitude.    In  so far  as more strictly political activity is concerned, attention has been con- centrated upon the opening of the Congress of the Second  International at Geneva.  An account of  this conference, and of the Miners&apos; International Conference, will be given in this Report next week.  The formation of a  United Communist Party on the 31st July is  a more important  event than  the formation  of Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs Communist Party on the 19th June, but neither of these parties exerts much influence on the labour situation.    The Unemployment Insurance Bill was read  a third time and  passed with some amendments by the House of  Lords on the 29th July.  The Ministry of Mines Bill was read a third time in the House of Commons and passed on the 30th July.  Further con- sideration of the Women, Young  Persons  and Children (Employment)  Bill is postponed to the autumn session. The Unemployment Position.    The number of H.M.  Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work  donation policies current for the week ending the 23rd July was 146,954, made up of  146,182 lodged by men and 772 by women.  On the 16th July there were  153,893 policies current,  153,059 for men and 834 for women.    On the 23rd July, 74,285 unemployment books, 53,146 for males and 21,139 for females, remained lodged  by workers under the Unemployment Insurance  Acts.  Compared with the previous week, when there  were 53,822 books lodged by males and 21,994 by females,the total decrease is 1,531.    The total live register for  all  Employment Exchanges on the 23rd July was 230,512 men, 48,090 women and 25,749 juveniles,  compared with 236,010  men, 47,839 women and 25,463 juveniles a week ago,  and 242,002 men, 47,138 women and 20,409 juvenilesa month ago. A detailed analysis  of the unemployment position will be found on page 205.FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.    Labour and Ireland. No important development has occurred  during the week.With regard to the meeting between certain members of the Parliamentary Committeeof the Trades Union Congress and representatives of the National Executive of the IrishLabour Party and Trades Union Congress which took place last week, no further steps have yet been taken and no report of the proceedings has so far been placed in the hands
 of the Committee as a whole.   One result of the disturbances in Belfast is the passing of a resolution by a section of the employees of Messrs. Workman, Clark &amp; Co., Ltd., to the effect that they  refuse to work with disloyal men, and demand that the firm in future employ  only loyal ex-Service  men  and  Protestant  Unionists.  The  expelled  workers have also been  holding  meetings and have issued a  manifesto  protesting against the treatment they have received.     Labour and  Russia. A manifesto signed by  five members  of the  British Labour delegation to Russia has  been issued by the National &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot; Committee, the signatories being Messrs. A. A. Purcell, H.  Skinner, Ben Turner, R. C. Wallhead and Robert Williams.  The document is designed to reach  the rank and file trade unionists, in case they should be called upon to decide what action they intend to take to give effect to the resolutions passed at  the special Trades Union Congress  on  the 13th July.  It appeals to all the branches to vote at their meetings in favour of  direct action, and thus support  the decision of the Trades Union Congress, which is described as one &quot; arrived at after  exhaustive consideration.&quot;     Labour and Co-operative Co-ordination. A. further step has been taken in the develop- ment of joint working arrangements  between the co-operative movement, the Trades Union Congress and  the  Labour Party.   At  a meeting of representatives of  the  three bodies, held on the 27th July, it was decided to appoint a sub-committee to draft a detailed scheme for joint  working as regards  publicity, the collection of statistical and  other information, and legal advice.  This scheme will then be considered by the full Co-ordination Committee of the three bodies before the meeting  of the Trades Union Congress on the 6th September.                    ^    Another aspect of these co-ordination proposals is the projected &quot; Labour and Co- operative Political Alliance.&quot;   This scheme was accepted by the  Labour Party at their recent annual conference  at Scarborough  and will be  considered by the Trades Union Congress in September.   The Co-operative Congress held in May at Bristol postponed decision  upon it until the meeting of 1921, but referred it to the constituent bodies for full consideration.  The directors of the Co-operative Wholesale  Society have passed a resolution declining to entertain the proposals as being contrary to the conditions under which the movement decided to seek representation in Parliament and on other public bodies.   Meetings have recently been held in eight divisional centres of the retail societies which constitute the Co-operative Wholesale Society.  These meetings have considered a resolution put forward  by the Stockport  society and  supported  by  16  other societies, instructing the directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Society to use the resources of the Society &quot; to support the practical application of the policy of the Co-operative Party.&quot; At these meetings representatives of the Board of Directors have opposed the motion on the ground that the business side of the co-operative movement ought  not to enter into politics.  The total votes  recorded show a majority for the Stockport resolution, though the resolution was passed in only three centres.  A great number of societies, have not yet declared their opinion.  The power of the Co-operative Wholesale  Society has  been shown recently by their conversion of the co-operative movement  as a whole to a hostile attitude  towards  the continuance of. food control.   It may be expected that the  Society will  keep clear of financial participation  in  the proposed &quot; Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance,&quot; and will succeed in persuading the movement to leave political activities to the Co-operative Union.    Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act.-There is some evidence that organised protests may be made against the operation of this Act. At  a  recent meeting of the London County Council it was decided to increase the rents of the working-class dwellings, exclusive of lodging-houses, under the control of the Council,  by the full amounts allowed under the Act.   This  decision  was opposed by the Labour  members, and Mr. Harry Gosling has stated that passive resistance is practically certain to follow the increase. Proposals for a no-rent strike on a large scale have been considerably advertised by the . National Union of Ex-Service Men, but this movement is apparently intended as a protest against high prices in general and is not aimed directly at the Act.   The  date of the strikewill be announced on the  27th August.  In the meantime the union are endeavouring to obtain the support of the large trade unions, and claim that their first adherent will bethe South Wales  Miners&apos;  Federation.  A publicity  campaign is being carried on with a view to obtaining general  support among the middle and working classes.   There are no indications at present that the propaganda is having the intended effect.    (BJL0322)                                                              2 D 2
     In Scotland the matter has been taken up by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Labour Housing Association.  A conference representative of these two bodies and of the co-operative movement in Scotland was held on the 31st July.  A reso- lution in favour of a 24 hours&apos; protest strike to take place on the 23rd August was carried by a large majority.   The strike is to be undertaken as the formal inauguration of a no-rent campaign throughout Scotland.     At Pontypridd a- meeting which claimed to represent 75,000 trade unionists decided to organise a campaign against the Act, and, as a preliminary step, to ask the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation to convene a special conference.  Reports from other areas contain accounts of similar activity and indicate that  united action on this question may take place in the near future.   The Labour Party, however, are giving no support to drastic action but are suggesting that the  proper policy to adopt is to spread information con- cerning the Act, in order that tenants may  obtain full benefit from its provisions.     Women,   Young Persons and Children  (Employment) Bill In consequence of the position created by the deletion of Clause 2 of this Bill in Standing Committee, it has been decided  to postpone the further consideration of the Bill  until the autumn.   The Home Secretary, in reply to a deputation who urged the re-insertion of the clause, has announced that a  departmental committee will be  set up  to  investigate the question  of women&apos;s labour under the shift system, with special reference to the provisions of this clause.   It will be recalled  that the clause aroused strong  opposition in the cotton and wool textile industries, but the-action of the Standing Committee has since  been condemned in certain other quarters.    Hours of Employment. -It is reported that a meeting of British shipmasters and officers have expressed dissatisfaction with  the failure of th,e International Labour Conference  at Genoa.to settle the question of hours of employmenHor seamen, and have passed a reso- lution calling  upon the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council to continue agitation for the inclusion of merchant seamen of all ratings within the scope of the Hours of Employment Bill.    Employment Exchanges. On the 2nd August the Committee of Inquiry heard evidence submitted by  chairmen of Local Employment Committees for the London area.  Mr. F.  C. Challenor, chairman of the Wimbledon Employment Committee, and Mr. A. E.  Adcock, chairman of the Deptford and Greenwich Employment Committee, were examined.  They protested against attacks  in the Press on  the Exchanges, suggested improvements  in buildings and staff organisation, and emphasised the importance of Local Employment Committees.   Mr. Leach, manager of the Bradford.  Exchange, also gave evidence.    On  the 3rd August evidence was heard from  Mr.  J. T.  Homer, C.B.E., Divisional Controller, West Midlands Division, Miss E. S. Fraser, Chief  Woman Officer, Northern Divison, Miss E.  J. Beardsley, M.B.E., Chief Woman  Officer,  North-Western Division, Mr. T. Goldsmith, Printing Trades Alliance and Printers&apos; Provident Association, and Messrs. A. J. Whitehead, W. Hatton and A. Fyfle, representing the National Association of Officers of the Ministry of Labour.    Building Guilds. lb is reported that a tender  submitted by the Guild of Builders (London), Ltd., for the building of 400 houses is being favourably received by the Waltham- stow Urban District Council.  Mr.  J. Dagger,  of  the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists, has been appointed chairman of this Guild, and Mr. Malcolm Sparks, secretary and director.    Considerable&apos; discontent is said to exist  in the Manchester area owing to  the hostile attitude  which,  it is alleged, many  local housing authorities are adopting over Building Guild tenders.   Mass meetings of building trades operatives have been held,  and reso- resolutions carried declaring that labour should be withheld  from private contractors who might receive, through unfair  means, housing contracts which  should have been granted to the local Building Guilds.  The local authorities involved are the Bredbury and Romiley Urban District  Council and the Hyde Corporation.   The Building  Guild Committees affected are  those for Stockport  and District,  and Ashton, Hyde and District.  These Guild Committees are, apparently, appendages of the Manchester Building Guild.    Unemployment:  Remedial and  Other Measwes-TherC are indications, in some few industries, of trade depressions resulting from commercial rather than.industrial causes, which may result in unemployment  or short-time working.  The industries which appear at present to be principally affected are all the leather industries, the Sheffield iron and steel industry, and the cotton and  wool  textile industries.  Coal export  restrictions are having severe effects in  a  few sharply defined areas and occupations.  The following
 paragraphs indicate the course of development in one or two industries.  The arrange- ments being made in  Plymouth in connection with the  ship-breaking scheme show the value of the local organisation of the Ministry.     There continue to be reports of unemployment caused, especially in South Wales, by the restriction  of coal exports.   Coal tippers at Cardiff  and Barry have received notices of discharge, and railwaymen may also  be affected.  The situation was discussed at a conference representative of the  workers concerned held at Cardiff on the  1st August, when resolutions were passed calling upon the executives of the National Union of Railway- men and the National Federation of Transport Workers to take up the question with the Government.     The Leicester boot and shoe trade held, on the 22nd July, a special meeting of the Arbitration and Conciliation Board to  consider  the question  of employment.  It was suggested that, in view of the present situation of the trade, work should be more evenly distributed among the operatives, and a resolution was adopted &quot; that with a desire to limit the amount of actual unemployment during the present period  of slackness of trade, manufacturers be  advised to work uniform short time, either departmentally or over the whole factory,  in  preference to discharging or suspending operatives.&quot;     Arrangements with regard to the Plymouth ship breaking  scheme formed the chief business at a meeting  of  the Plymouth and District Employment Committee held on the 29th July.  By arrangement with the Ministry of Labour, the  Admiralty, and the contractor concerned, all labour will be recruited through the Plymouth and Devonport Exchanges and preference will be given to ex-Service men to the extent at least of 75 per cent, of those employed.  A sub-committee of the Employment Committee was set up to advise the Exchange, composed of five trade unionists and five representatives of ex- Service men.  The nomination of the five ex-Service men was left to the Comrades of the Great War and the National Union of Ex-Service Men. Industrial and Other Organisations.     United Textile  Workers&apos; Association.-T\iQ annual meeting of  this association was held at Blackpool on the 26th and 27th July.  Mr. Walter Gee, of Hyde, presided, and about 250 delegates were  present.  Proposals put forward by  the Legislative Council for the transformation of the association into a  complete political and industrial federation of all trade unions in the Lancashire cotton industry were discussed, and in spite of considerable opposition to the scheme, a speech by  Mr. Cross, the general secretary, procured the consent of the delegates to submit it to their several organisations in order to  be prepared to vote upon it at a special  conference summoned for the 13th November.     It was unanimously resolved  to recommend the appointment of  a Royal  Commission to inquire into the position of the cotton industry,,and the conditions prevailing therein. This proposal originated with Mr. Henry Boothman, general secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners, who explained to the conference that the proposal was due, not to the desire for higher wages or  shorter hours, but to the general feeling of indignation that it should have been possible for &quot;  a group of  financiers and company-mongers &quot; to take advantage of the circumstances of the cotton industry after the war.   The question of  shorter hours was also  discussed  and the Legislative Council were requested to enter into negotiations with the  employers for a shorter working week. The conference expressed itself in  favour of local autonomy in the matter of hours of beginning work in the morning.  A resolution was adopted demanding an  amendment of the Factory Acts to make 60o the minimum  temperature in cotton warehouses, and winding, warping, twisting and drawing  rooms.   Other resolutions were adopted urging the Government to reduce the age limit for old age pensions from 70 to 60 years, and to raise the amount  to  l a week;  demanding that the administration of unemployment insurance be placed in the hands of bona fide trade union organisations. Several other resolutions dealt with conditions of work in the mills.  In  connection with the Unemploy- ment Insurance  Bill a report on the advisability of contracting out of the scheme was presented by the Legislative Council.  The report condemned, as totally inadequate, thebenefits proposed under the official scheme.  It was pointed out that in the manufacturing section loss of  wages through part-time employment was  greater  than through  totalunemployment, and that in the event of contracting out the Government should be pressed to make the State  contribution equal in such cases to the  amount given where there wasno contracting out.
18.80.-     North Staffordshire Colliery Under-Managers&apos;Association. A meeting of this association has recently been held at Stoke.   A report was made of the progress of the organisation of the Colliery Under-Managers&apos;  Association- of England and Wales.  A further meeting of the national body  will be held in Birmingham on the  4th September -to appoint a permanent secretary and organiser.  It was decided that the North Staffordshire Association will support the  nomination of Mr. Underwood as permanent secretary and organiser of the national organisation.     National Federation of Building  Trade Employers. The half-yearly meeting of this Federation  was held at Newcastle on the 18th July.  The Council reported that they regretted that the introduction of the 44-hour week had not resulted in the increase of output promised by the operatives.   The report called the  attention of members to the reports on training-of apprentices and education issued by  the Education  Committee of the Industrial Council for the Industry.  It was a matter of urgency, however, for every employer to take and train the full complement of apprentices allowable under the existing working rules agreement.  A deputation representative of the whole of the building trade was appointed to wait upon the  Minister of Health to discuss with him the question of payment of wages in excess of the standard rates. A resolution was adopted unanimously protesting against the proposal to guarantee building trade operatives engaged on housing a full week&apos;s pay through wet or fine weather, and payment by the week instead of by the hour.  The  conference agreed to a resolution to instruct the administrative committees of the various Federations to  send  in notices withdrawing from the National Conciliation Board scheme.   A recommendation  for the  establishment  of a  National, Wages and Conditions of Service  Council for the building trades  was approved and adopted. Trade Union Topics.     Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society. The scheme  of amalgamation among the bricklayers, masons and kindred workers in the building trades has now been  completed and details of the new scales of contributions and benefits have been prepared for submission to the members of the  societies  concerned.  These are the Operative Bricklayers Society, the Manchester  Unity of  Operative  Bricklayers Trade, Accident, Sick and  Burial Society, the Operative Society  of Stonemasons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades and the Society of Street Masons and Paviors.  It is considered probable that other associations such as the plasterers&apos; and the kindred Scottish societies who have recently been putting into operation an amalgamation of their own, will subsequently enter the  new society.    Monmouthshire  and  South  Wales&apos; Colliery  Enginemen, Stokers  and Craftsmen&apos;s Association.-kt the association^ half-yearly meeting held on the 24th July at Cardiff, it was unanimously decided to accept the recommendation of the sub-committee jointly appointed by this association and the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation to  take a ballot of the members on the proposed amalgamation with the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.    South Wales  and Monmouthshire  Colliery Examiners&apos; Society.-lt is reported that a joint meeting of this society, the South Wales and Monmouthshire Master Hauliers and Traffic Foremen&apos;s Association and the  Mining Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild. was held on the 26th July, and the  scheme of amalgamation which has been under discussion for some time was finally approved.  The officers provisionally appointed for  the new body were chairman, Mr. R. A. Williams, representing the examiners; vice-chairman, Mr. T. James, of the master  hauliers; secretary,  Mr. Ben Griffiths, of the clerks&apos; guild; and treasurer, Mr. E.  J. Davies, of the examiners.    National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union.-ln connection with the ballot on the nationali- sation of the shipping industry, figures are-now to hand which indicate that the voting will go heavily against any  form  of nationalisation,  but the ballot  is far from complete and the final figures will not be  available until September.  The ballot on the question of affiliation to the Labour Party is also incomplete,  but the figures obtained so far give similar indication of a result in favour of affiliation.  Such a decision would place Mr. Havelock Wilson in a difficult position, in view of his expressed determination never to join the Parliamentary Labour  Party. Ex-Service Men.    Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations.-ln connection with the proposal of theNational Federation of Discharged  and Demobilised Sailors  and Soldiers that the chiefbodies, catering for Ex-Service men should meet early in August to discuss a scheme of
NEGOTIATIONS  AND  DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Printing and Allied Trades.    Printers.-For the position in this dispute see p. 220, below.  The Manchester branchof the Association have instructed their members employed by firms outside the federation to tender notices to  cease work on  the date of the threatened lock-out.   The chief non-federated firms are the Co-operative Wholesale Society and the Co-operative NewspaperSociety.Public and Public Utility Services.    Gas  Workers (National).-A national conference of gas workers&apos; delegates was heldin London on the 27th July when the situation was reviewed.  It was stated that reports from  most  districts indicated  great  dissatisfaction  with the  recent settlement.  The                 * See this Report, Vol.. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 135.amalgamation^ the Veterans&apos; Association, the Officers&apos;  Association  and the NationalUnion of Ex-Service Men have accepted the invitation.   The conference is to be held inLondon on the 7th August.  The National Union  of Ex-Service Men, however, have laiddown three conditions and unless these are accepted they will refuse to participate in theconference.  These conditions are as  follows:            That it should be recognised that the hardships inflicted upon ex-Service men are necessarily       incidental to the capitalist system and can only be abolished by abolishing that system.           That anti-militarism should be one of the main features of ex-Service men&apos;s policy.           That any organisation of ex-Service men shall be debarred from  receiving financial support       from any member of the capitalist class.    There is no likelihood of the other bodies accepting these principles.    Joint Committee on the Employment of Demobilised Officers. An advisory committee under this title has been set up for the purpose of co-ordinating the work of the Officers&apos;Association and of the Appointments Department  of the Ministry.  The functions of theCommittee will be (a) to act as liaison between the Association and the department, and(6) to represent  the interests of ex-officers and of  ex-Service men  of similar  educationalqualifications, and to concert improvements in  existing procedure or&quot;neW methods?fortheir assistance, and to make recommendations to the Ministry of Labour or to the Officers&apos;Association.  Lord Haig has consented to become the chairman of the committee.  Thesecretary is Mr. R. Oldfield,  Appointments Department.    Ex-Officers&apos;  National Federation. It is  announced  that steps are being taken towind  up this association.International Relations of Labour.    International  Transport  Workers&apos; Federation.-!^  executive  committee  of  thisfederation  met in Amsterdam on  the  24th and  25th  July.   Those present were Messrs.Robert Williams (England) president, C. H. Lindley (Scandinavian countries),  A. Forstner(Austria),  Edo.  Fimmen (Holland), secretary, and together &quot;with  Messrs.  Moltmakerand  Hoff,  who  were present from the  Management Committee.  Messrs.  Bidegaray(France) and Doring *(Germany)  were absent.  Reports were&quot; received and&apos; discussion took  place concerning the boycott of Hungary.   It was  decided^that Messrs. Williamsand Fimmen should  visit Jugo-Slavia  and the Balkans, if possiblerthis?year, in order tostrengthen the relations with the organisations of transport  workers and  railwaymenthere. The secretary reported the affiliation since the 1st June last of various organisationshaving a total membership of 232,000.  The committee instructed its secretary  to send a telegram to the International Miners&apos;  Conference in session  at Geneva conveying^thefraternal greetings of the transport workers and declaring that the international solidarityof the workers is more urgent than ever before.   The next full Congress of the Federationis to  be  held next March at  Geneva.
  Negotiating Committee were instructed to seek a further meeting with the employers,  and will demand an additional Is. per day or shift.      Gas Workers [North-Western  Area). A meeting of Manchester gas workers on the  28th July  passed a resolution against accepting the latest terms offered by the employers  on the North-West Regional Council.   Gas workers at Salford and Burnley are  reported  to have accepted these terms.  Miscellaneous Trades.      Co-operative Wholesale Society Employees (National). A dispute has arisen  between  the Co-operative Wholesale  Society  and the Amalgamated  Union of Co-operative and  Commercial Employees and  Allied Workers over the interpretation of a national wages  agreement arrived at in May, 1920.   The Co-operative Wholesale Society wish  to limit  the application of the  wages advance  to certain classes of distributive workers and to  exclude all workers  connected with production.  The union do not accept this interpre-  tation.  Strikes and Lock-Outs.  Transport.      Dockers [Middlesbrough). Dockers at Middlesbrough are on strike owing to a dispute  involving the interpretation of the recent dockers&apos; national agreement.  Textile Trades.      Lace Operatives  (Nottingham). The plain net workers at Nottingham, who have been  on strike since the 11th June, have decided to call out the Derby and West of England  operatives  on the 14th August, and. threaten them with expulsion from the British Federa-  tion of Lace Operatives if they fail to comply.  Woodworking.      Furniture Workers  (Yorkshire). There is no  change in the strike of furniture workers  which affects Leeds, Bradford, Keighley, Halifax and Brighouse.  Public and Public Utility Services.      Gas Workers (Wigan).-k sudden  strike of gas  workers occurred at Wigan on the  31st July.   The men are dissatisfied with the delay in the  resumed negotiations.      Gas Workers (Neath). Gas workers at Neath refused to accept the national agreement,  and struck on the 28th July for the payment of the increase of 10s. per week originally  demanded,, which, they allege, is being paid in certain  neighbouring towns.  Settlements and  Agreements.&apos;  Metal) Engineering and Shipbuilding.      Electricians  (Port of London). The electricians who have been on  strike* since the  1st July in support  of  a demand for the payment of the district rate of 2s. Sd. per hour  agreed to resume work on the 3rd August on the understanding that a conference should  be held on that  day to discuss their claim.  Agriculture.      Agricultural Labourers (Cheshire). It is  reported that the Cheshire  agricultural  labourers, who struckf on the 5th July in support of a demand for 13 a week, are gradually  returning to work on the old terms.

StatisticaL-Bumig the week the men&apos;s live register has decreased by 5,498, whilethe women&apos;s  live register  shows an increase of 251.  The  vacancies carried forward,exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 502 as  regards men and a decreaseof 2,765 in respect of women.   All the divisions show decreases in the men&apos;s register.The Exchanges showing the largest decreases are Enfield,  Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Westminster,Bristol,  Portsmouth,  Hull, Blackburn,  Manchester,  Newton  Heath,  Dundee, Leith,Parkhead, Newport Docks and  Swansea.   The occupations  chiefly affected by  thedecreases are those of clerks, shop assistants, carmen, porters, motor drivers, agricultural workers, navvies and general labourers.    Increases in the register are reported from Camberwell Green,  Stepney, Reading,Halifax, Birkenhead, Bpotle, Openshaw, Gateshead, Heaton,  Stockton, West Hartlepool,Swansea Docks and  Aberdeen.  The  occupations chiefly affected by the increases arethose of leather.workers, furniture workers, iron and steel rolling mill workers, seamen and shipyard labourers.    As regards the women&apos;s registers all the divisions show increases in the live register,except the South-Western,  the North-Western, the Northern  and the Scotland  Divisions.The Exchanges showing the greatest  increases are Woolwich, Birmingham, Smethwick,Walsall, Attercliffe and Rotherham.  The occupations chiefly  affected by the increases arethose of non-resident domestic servants, metal  machinists,  tailoresses and unskilledfactory workers.Men&apos;s Employment.    General Outlook, The labour position during the week has been peculiar owing to the incidence, in a number of localities, of the annual holidays, but where work has been carriedon under normal conditions there are no striking indications  of change.    In the shipbuilding and allied industries a shortage of material is still a factor retardingdevelopment.  In the Tyneside and Wearside areas several firms have on that accountbeen compelled to lay-off a number of employees, and unless fuller supplies of material areforthcoming, unemployment will undoubtedly increase. On Tees-side  the labour positioncontinues favourable and there is every promise of its continuing to do so for  some  con-siderable time.    The reports from the  North-Western Division, while furnishing further evidence of continued slackness in several important industries, on the  whole reveal more hopeful signs,.    (B 16322)                                                   -       2 E
  The returns show a decrease of 78 in the men&apos;s live register as compared with an increase  of 1,681 in the preceding week.  The position in the cotton trade  remains unchanged.  A number of managers in this division.mention the prevailing unrest in the engineering  industry, which is apparently approaching a crisis on the question of the claim for increased  wages recently refused by the  Court of Arbitration.      No improvement in the leather, boot and shoe and lace industries is as yet apparent.  On the other hand, there  are local indications of improvement in the general engineering  and rubber trades, and the fancy leather trade is reported to be very good.      Industrial Developments. Guildford report that the factory  of  the Chilworth Gun-  powder Co., Ltd., which recently  went into liquidation,  is expected to be re-opened as  a soap  factory.   Messrs.  Macdonald, Gibbs and Co., contractors, are about to commence  the construction of large  barracks at Halton Camp,  Wendover, where large numbers of  bricklayers, carpenters, painters and other skilled building operatives will soon be required.  Plymouth  report that ship-breaking operations will shortly commence upon which ulti-  mately  1,000  men will be employed.   Grimsby report the commencement of the con-  struction of a  new dam at the dry docks.      Labour Reductions.-M.ems. J. &amp; E. Hall, Ltd., Dartford, have discharged a number  of fitters and turners.   There is a tendency in the factories at Dartford to substitute juvenile  for adult workers.  Ramsgate report that 300 men are about to be discharged from Rich-  borough.   More firms in the Northampton area  engaged in the boot and shoe and leather  industries are  discharging workmen.  At Reading, Messrs. Huntley&apos; &amp; Palmers, Ltd., and,  Messrs.  Huntley, Boorne  &amp; Stevens, Ltd.,  are  decreasing their staffs.  The workpeople  affected are of unskilled grades and are difficult to re-absorb in local industry.   Bridgwater  report that slackness continues to affect the wicker and cabinet-making industries.   Some  discharges  have been made from the factory of the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., at Aston,  and at  Smethwick. Messrs. E. G. Wrigley &amp; Co., Ltd., makers of motor-car transmission  gear, have discharged 150  men owing to slackness of trade.  At Scarborough a number of  discharges have been made from a shipyard of the  Whitby  and Skinningrove  Iron Co.,  owing to the shortage of work and materials.  Discharges have been made by the Gloucester  Railway Carriage and  Wagon Co., Ltd.,  owing  to shortage  of materials.  A number of  discharges have also been made by the Vulcan  Motor Co., Ltd., Southport, and Crossley  Motors,  Ltd., Openshaw.     Labour Supply and Demand. The manager  of the London (Central) Exchange for the Building Trades reports that it is still difficult to secure bricklayers, plasterers and joiners, but that the position in regard  to  carpenters has become appreciably easier.  There are still considerable numbers of painters and electricians unemployed and, in consequence, large numbers of painters&apos; labourers and wiremen&apos;s  assistants are also out of employment. Navvies of the better  class are becoming  more difficult to  find, but there are many general  labourers still  on the  live register,  and orders for  this  class  of labour have diminished.     The position in the provinces with regard to skilled building labour has undergone no change.     There is still an unsatisfied demand for moulders, shipwrights, wheelwrights, sheet- metal workers, coach and wagon builders and cabinet-makers.     Kingston-on-Thames  report that  motor-body makers  are  urgently  required  by Leyland Motors, Ltd.  Skilled moulders and engineering operatives  are in  demand for factories at  Letchworth, but it is at present impossible to import labour owing to the lack of  accommodation.     Shortage of Materials.-Rotherhithe state that the shortage and high price of sugar areresponsible  for diminished activity in the biscuit and jam industries.  At Brixton theconstruction of a new factory for the Stelfast Wheel Co. is delayed owing to inability toobtain glass for the roofs.   Shortage of  materials is  retarding the engineering and textiletrades at Reddish, and  the shipbuilding and engineering trades at  Sunderland as well as elsewhere.Women&apos;s Employment.    General Industrial Situation.situation reported last Week  appears to be tin3changed.   The holidays now taking place in the north synchronise with considerable trade depression, and in the textile industries a number of mills are reported to  be closed or working  short  time.
      In the South Midlands and Eastern Division,  the slackness which has obtained for  many weeks past in the boot and shoe trade is increasing in all the more important centres,  as is also the seasonal slackness in the straw hat trade at Luton.      The West Midlands Division report  continued slackness in the jewellery, rubber and  leather trades.      The Northern Division state generally that, with the exception of the demand for  domestic workers, there are few openings for women.      In the South-Western Division general slackness appears to prevail.  In Yeovil many  vacancies for glove makers have been cancelled, and at Swindon the clothing factories are  reported slack.      In Wales the situation is unchanged. The main demand is for domestics in seasonal  and private work, and applicants are reported to be showing more willingness to accept  this employment.      Local Reports.-Slackness continues  in most of the London factory areas.  Bromley  state that unemployment appears to be increasing and the City report that there is a  noticeable decrease in the number of vacancies notified.      The Leyton Exchange state that, owing to the slackness in the clothing, French polish-  ingand boot, manufacturing trades, many skilled as well as unskilled workers are receiving  their discharge.      King&apos;s Cross refer to the difficulties experienced with the rough type of worker applying  for unemployment insurance  benefit.  It is found that some have had as many as four  unemployment books issued to them in various names.      Seasonal activity  is reported from the seaside Exchanges. Eastbourne state that  the live register is lower than at any time this year.  Folkestone report that seasonal work  is  progressing very satisfactorily and that valuable assistance is being rendered by the  Deptford and  Holloway  Exchanges.   A  number of Deptford applicants have also been  placed in the Margate area.      Placings have been effected with a  jam factory at Bridgwater  and with a  firm of  fruit canners at Cheltenham.  The slackness at the works of Messrs. S.  J. Moreland &amp; Sons,  Ltd., Gloucester, match manufacturers, is said to be due to lack of material and orders.     At Bromsgrove the artificial fly dressers&apos; industry is active, but other local industries are on  short time..  At Burton-on-Trent many local applicants are waiting for employment with Messrs.  Crosse &amp; Blackwell, Ltd., and the Silvertown India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Co., Ltd., who hope to be able to employ considerable numbers in the near future.     The Smethwick Exchange state that the increase of their live register is partly due to  a  number of women who received 90 days&apos;  benefit during the last insurance year re- registering in order to make fresh claims during the current year.  The maj ority are married, and local firms are unwilling to employ  them.  The Aston  Exchange also refer to the difficulty of placing middle-aged married women, and state that owing to trade slackness there is difficulty in finding employment even for the young single women.   There is still a shortage of brass polishers in this district and of thoroughly experienced moppers and platers at Selly Oak.     Loughborough report slackness in the hosiery factories.  At Northampton blouse and pinafore factories are working half time, and at Coalville short time is  being worked in the clothing factories.    Depression in the cotton trade still continues in several districts in the North-Western Division, where there is also depression in the hatting industry at DentOn and in the bleach- ing trade at Horwich.  Jam manufacture at Wigan is suffering from the general depression in the trade.    The Yorkshire and East  Midlands Division report general trade depression in the woollen, worsted, wholesale clothing and leather industries.   At Otley all the employees of a firm of leather curriers have been discharged for a week,  and will return to work for five days, after which they will again cease for ten days or a fortnight.  Further discharges are expected.  The unsettled condition of the lace  industry, brought about  by the strike in the plain net section, and the depressed  condition of the hosiery industries, are affecting employment at Nottingham, Beeston and Ilkeston.  At Hull the tin trade is slack owing,it is said, to shortage of material.   Many women and girls have been discharged from one ofthe local factories.    In  Scotland a number of. Exchanges report activity in connection with recruiting  fruitpickers  for the Auchterarder and Blairgowrie districts.  Glasgow state that  80 have beensent to Blairgowrie and 40 to Auchterarder, and 61 others will soon be sent. Many workers    (B 16322)                                                             2 Eg
are, however, failing to report when summoned.  The Greenock Exchange report thatsome have cancelled their applications owing to their inability to. pay fares.   The jutetrade in Dundee continues to be slack and the only vacancies are for highly skilled workers.    In Wales the Newtown, Aberystwyth and Colwyn Bay Exchanges comment on the impossibility of supplying domestic workers for the large seasonal demand.                      LOCAL  EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities  of Committees.    Establishments of Committees.-The newly established committee for the New  mills and Buxton area held their first meeting  during the week.  It was decided that meetingsof the main committee should be held quarterly.    Employment and Resettlement-The Portsmouth Committee express &quot;great concern atthe unemployment position during the last four months, and suggest the formation of ajoint committee  of representatives of Local Employment  Committees, local authorities,and the local Chamber of Commerce, to consider constructive steps to alleviate the distressexpected during the coming winter.    Bedford are concerned about the distress amongst workpeople  at Olney,  owing toslackness in local industries, and are urging the local authorities to make application fora grant from the Prince of Wales&apos;s Fund.    Ramsgate view with  alarm  the large numbers  of men  daily  discharged  fromRichborough without any prospect of employment in the  district.  It has come to their knowledge that,  notwithstanding these  daily discharges, other men are being  imported into the district, and it is understood that overtime is being worked.    Out-of-Worh  Donation and  Unemployment Insurance.--The Eccles Committee  haveexpressed themselves in favour of compulsory notification of vacancies and registration, andof each industry bearing the cost of its own unemployment as the only satisfactory way of preventing economic distress. Until this latter principle is universally recognised thecommittee accept State insurance as a step in the right direction.    Ilford suggest that the regulations governing out-of-work donation should be amended so as to extend the period of  eligibility for disabled men who have been under treatment for their disablement since discharge.  East Ham  recommend that out-of-work donationshould be continued until such time as the men have the opportunity of obtaining employ-ment, and that, failing this, the Ministry should formulate some scheme whereby these men would become useful citizens.    Ex-Service Men. A list of unemployed disabled ex-Service men has been sent to members  of the Sheffield Committee, and each member of the committee has undertaken to make individual efforts to obtain employment for these men.    The Exeter Committee were informed that certain men employed on remunerative work during the dav were engaged after 8 p.m. at the Exeter Post Office in delivering telegrams.They considered this work could well be done by disabled ex-Service men, and are takingthe matter up with the authorities.   The question of the substitution of ex-Service men forwomen  in employment continues to occupy the attention of most of the committees.    Training. As  a result  of the Cardiganshire Committee&apos;s overtures to  the  ChiefLibrarian of Wales, they have  been informed that the  National Library Committee areprepared to undertake the training of disabled ex-Service men in their printing department.     Women&apos;s Work Crewe report that of the  12 trainees from the local domestic centrewho had been placed in domestic service, only one remained with the employer with whomshe had been placed and that the rest were no longer in domestic service.  The TrainingSub-Committee are interviewing the women.    Miscellaneous. The decision to discontinue the publication of The Month&apos;s Work hasbeen received with regret by  a number of committees, and Finchley are of opinion that itis very desirable that  some publication should  be devised to serve as a means of com-munication and information  between Local Employment  Committees.     A  conference of chairmen of  Employment Committees in the  Metropolitan area has  .been held to consider what,action could be taken in connection with the Press criticism onthe work of Employment Exchanges, and a deputation was appointed to present the views of the conference to the Committee of Inquiry. *                                * See p. 200 above.

To  make  provision for  the position as regards  ex-members  of  the  Forces  and merchant seamen arising in consequence of the expiry of Special Extension Scheme No. 2,* it has been decided to extend the payment of out-of-work donation to workers of these classes who  have exhausted their claim to  donation  under the  original scheme and previous extensions, or whose original policies have  become invalid by  reason  of the lapse of twelve months since personal demobilisation. Provision is made for the payment of donation for a  maximum period of 48 days, to be  drawn between the 2nd August and the 6th November.     The rate of donation, both for members of the Forces and for merchant seamen, will be 205. per week, in the case of men, and 15s. per week in the case of  women.  In the case of the mercantile marine, boys and girls over 15  and under 18  years of age, will receive IQs. and 7s. Qd. per week, respectively.  As under Special Extension Scheme No. 2, there will be no supplementary donation in respect of children, and the special allowance of 4s. per week, authorised in certain  cases for men of 20 per cent,  disablement, will not be payable.                                 PORT LABOUR. Port Labour Committees.    London.-The  registration scheme has been  successfully  inaugurated, at a time, however, when there is a marked depression in trade at the docks, and large numbers of registered men  are  unable to find employment.                       * See this Report, VoL I, No. 11, 10th April, p. 366.
             DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.    Up to and including the 28th July, certificates had been issued to 18,927 employers,employing 3,102,259 workpeople.  The number  of disabled ex-Service men covered bythese undertakings is 182,412.    In the West Midlands Division the &quot; Lest We Forget&quot; film is now being shown again in areas where it is considered that  the  greatest effect will be  produced.  At Astonnegotiations are taking place with a local dairy firm with a view to the employment of agood number of disabled men as roundsmen.  The Kidderminster Employment committee report that practically every employer has now given an undertaking.    The special officer for the Wales Division reports that canvassing is still in progress,and that the number of undertakings completed is increasing appreciably.    The special officer  for the South-Western Division reports that many firms are still-considering enrolling^  He  speaks highly of the  value  of the special film.   During- themonth interviews were obtained with  Lord Eortescue, Lord  Mount Edgcumbe, LordsLieutenant  of the Counties  of Devon and Cornwall, respectively, and as a result specialappeals appeared in every paper throughout the counties, and 3,000 special letters of appealwere sent to all  urban district councils,  rural  district councils,  and  magistrates, andinfluential people.  A special appeal for the Plymouth  area was also made  in the Pressby Lord Mount Edgcumbe and over 200 special letters were circulated by him to the leadingcitizens and employers of Plymouth in order to  stimulate interest in the scheme.  Theresults so far have been disappointing.    In the Scotland Division the special canvass resulted in 477  fresh  undertakings.Propaganda films are still being shown.Placings.    West Midlands-The number of fresh  registrations during the  month ending the 9thJuly was 857.    The placings totalled 543, and at the end of the period the live registerstood at 940.  The Sparkhill  Exchange report that there are no immediate prospects ofthe disabled men remaining  on the live register being absorbed, owing to the serious natureof their disabilities.    The Coventry Exchange placed two men with a firm of gas-meter manufacturers at a weekly wage of  4 8s., and a one-armed man as a watchman at 706&quot;. per week.   At Burton-on-Trent a man suffering from gas poisoning and heart trouble was placed as a steam cranedriver at  4 10s. per week.  The Stourbridge Exchange report the placing of a one-armedman as a clerk-timekeeper, the man having learned to write with the left hand.    Wales. The fresh  registrations during the month ending the  9th  July  totalled 322and the placings 144.  At the end of the period the number of disabled men remaining onthe live register was 490.    The Swansea Employment Exchange report the placing of a  signalman and a gardeneras telephone attendants, a railway carriage  greaser and a motor-fitter as postmen, a navvyas a watchman, and a colliery labourer and a coal-trimmer as clerks,Employment Department-continued.    Middlesbrough. Huts have recently been installed at the docks by the Ministry forthe purpose of working a registration scheme, and the committee is being reconstitutedwith a view to an early meeting to put the scheme  into operation.    Hartlepools-Tlie joint industrial council formed at the docks some months ago have adopted the registration scheme formulated by the Port Labour Committee. Applicationhas been made to the Ministry for a supply of registration tallies.  .  Bridgwater. A  sub-committee  of the Bridgwater  Employment  Committee  have recommended that a decasualisation scheme should be introduced  at the port.  The numberof dockers employed is under 40.  It should not be difficult, therefore, to devise a workablescheme.    Ipswich,-A. deputation from the Ipswich Committee have recently visited Bristol toexamine the registration scheme in operation at that port, and following the deputationsreport it has now been decided to adopt a similar scheme.  This committee report thatthe present hours for opening licensed  premises lead to dockers absenting themselvesduring working hours, and failing an alteration of hours by the licensing authorities thecommittee  suggest the provision of a canteen at the  docks.
                               JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile  Employment Committees.    Employment By-Laws (Bedford). On the suggestion of the Bedford Juvenile AdvisoryCommittee, the Bedford Education Committee have inserted in their draft by-laws underthe Education Act,  1918, a clause making it compulsory for juveniles employed in streettrading to register at the Exchange.  It is hoped by this means that the Juvenile AdvisoryCommittee will be able to persuade juveniles to take up more desirable employment.  Thedraft by-laws are being submitted to the Home Office for approval.    Apprenticeship: Drapery  Trade (Pembroke Dock). The local  drapers&apos; associationhave recently notified the Pembroke Dock Juvenile Advisory Committee of the  revisedrates of pay which they agreed topay apprentices. The age of commencement of apprentice-ship is assumed to be 15 years, the rates for girls are from 5s. per week to commence with,rising to  15s. per week by 2s. increases every six months, and those fixed for boys are from7s. 6ef. per week, rising by half-yearly increases of 2s. Qd. to 20s. per week.    Employment of Girls in Domestic  Service. The Juvenile Employment committees at Burnley, Dudley, Lewisham, Northampton, Southampton, Westminster and Wimbledonhave laid down standard conditions which, they consider,  should be given to domesticworkers.   The initial wages suggested vary from 4s. per week in the case of Dudley and southampton to 10s. per week in the case of Burnley, but about  15 per annum is the more general figure proposed for beginners of 14 or 15 years of age.   All committees recommenda half-day holiday each week and make special provision for Sunday.  The need for short periods off duty, apart, from meal-times, is also generally recognised.  In four  cases atten-tion is drawn to  the necessity of proper sleeping and other accommodation.  Dudley,Lewisham and Wimbledon, suggest a limitation of the hours of work, and all except Dudleyand Southampton suggest two weeks&apos; annual holiday with pay.    Learners : Motor-Body Building (London). The London (Central) Juvenile AdvisoryCommittee have made an inquiry throughout London as to the possibility of introducinglearners of 14 and of 16 to 17 years of age in the motor-body building trade.   The&quot; inquirycovered 86 firms, employing about 5,000 adults and 650 boys.  In the larger and betterorganised shops the proportion of boys to adults is about 1 to 5 or 1 to 6, but in some of thesmall  shops the employers decline to take boys at all on the plea that they cannot spareskilled men to train them.  Most employers prefer to take boys of 14, as falling most readilyinto workshop ways ; a few prefer boys of 15 or 16 on the score of strength.  There appeared,&apos;however, to be very little willingness either to increase the number of learners of 14 to 16or to take older boys who had received a short preliminary technical training.    [Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also  be found on pages  198, 201 and 218 to 223.]    South-Western. The Bristol Exchange report growing difficulty in placing disabledmen, but efforts are being made to find them employment as tramway conductors.  Thechief difficulty is the severe medical examination the company impose.&apos;    Northern. The Middlesbrough Exchange report the placing of a man in domestic service, to live in, at  40 per year.

EX-SERVICE  MEN.General.    Statistical. On the 28th July 24,099 men were in training, as against 24,095 on the21st July, and 24,310 on the 30th June.  On the 28th July there were 21,772 men awaitingtraining, the corresponding totals for the 21st July and the 30th June being 22,013 and23,098, respectively.    On the 28th July the number of men whose training bad been completed since the1st August, 1919, was 13,812, the  totals for the 21st July and the 30th June being 13,430and 12,255, respectively.    There has been  no material  change in the general position during the week.  Thenumber of terminations was practically unaltered, and may be regarded as normal.   Therehas been a fairly satisfactory reduction in the waiting list, which, in the past four  weekshas been diminished by 1,326.  Holiday influences are still at work and any  marked change is hardly probable for some little time.    It is estimated that during July 1,346 men have been placed in training, that is anaverage of 336 per week.  This is less satisfactory than that obtained in June.    Exhibitions-The exhibition at the Central Hall, Westminster, was brought to a closeon the 29th July, when the Minister expressed his appreciation of the work of all, andespecially the men in training,  who had been concerned in an effort the  general successof which was never in doubt.  It is as yet too early to sum up the results of the exhibition,but there was an average attendance of over  1,000 each day.   Employers and representa-tives of trade societies and of trade journals were among the visitors and both the Londonand provincial newspapers had appreciative reports.   The excellence of workmanshipwas freely admitted on all sides.    Insurance of Men in Training. The department is in communication with the Ministryof Health regarding the position of men in training under maintenance, in connection withinsurance, and a  conference between all departments interested is proposed.    Instructional Visits. A scheme put forward by the Northern Division, whereby arrange-ments will be made for men in training in certain courses to visit  local factories for in-structional purposes, is under consideration.  It is considered thatithese visits will be useful,as giving the men an insight into practical industrial conditions.    Elementary Teachers. The date for the opening of the Sarisbury Court Training Collegehas now been fixed for the 1st September.  A proposal is under consideration for the transferof the students to London for three weeks of  the period of school practice required by theBoard of Education^ regulations.  This plan will  give three  weeks&apos; continuous practice in London schools, which should prove more effective than isolated days in country schools.

 Ex-Service Men-continued.     Hostels.-A provisional equipment schedule has been settled for Springfield College, Moseley.  It is expected that the vice-president, eight members  of the staff, 68 men in training and some of the domestic staff will reside in the main building, and that the canteen will be available for about 82 additional men in training, as well as for any further instructors. There are also two small houses available for residential purposes.     The Divisional Director for Ireland has submitted a scheme for recreation for the men in training at the Tipperary Centre.     Government Instructional Factories. There  are now  only  10 vacant places  at  the Instructional Factory, High Road,  Tottenham.   The numbers at Sarisbury Court have risen to 106 and the Divisional Director is taking steps to fill the 50 additional places which are now available.  The number of men in training at the Walker Factory has increased by 58 to 262 during the past three weeks.     The principle has been laid down that one draughtsman only should be employed on the stall of an instructional factory.   If further assistance is required arrangements have been made whereby  the local District  Director of the Appointments Department will  supply a man training in draughtsmanship to take part of his course at the factory.     Equipment  and Supplies. During the past week deliveries to the Central Stores have been greatly  accelerated. Treasury Sanctions.     The following  are among the  most  important of  a number  of  proposals that have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report: -     Expenditure upon an exhibition of the work of disabled ex-Service men in training to be held at Barry during the first week in August.     Expenditure upon hostel and canteen  equipment for  the Government Instructional Factory, Luton, and the transfer from the Ministry of Munitions of certain office furniture.     Expenditure upon the equipment of  the Hornsey  Instructional Factory for  training 324 men in the furniture and building trades.     Authority to arrange for the periodic examination of men in training at Government Instructional Factories by the medical referees of the Ministry of Pensions and to reimburse the Ministry of  Pensions the charges made by such medical referees.     The payment of a fee of 5s.  for each man in training medically examined by  a special medical referee as to fitness for training in diamond cutting and polishing.     The  issue of free railway  tickets to  apprentices training  under the  Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme in institutions to  enable them to travel to and from  home when the institution is closed for a vacation of more than a week, provided the apprentice cannot return to his employer.  No maintenance allowance will be paid while the institution is closed.     The payment, subject to certain conditions,  of full maintenance  allowances to ap- prentices training under the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme in an institution whilst absent during sickness. Schemes Sanctioned.    During the  week  19 schemes,  providing 384 places, have been sanctioned.  Included in this number are 80 places for training in various branches of the building trade. National Trade Advisory Committees.    Musical Instruments.-A meeting of  the National  Trade Advisory Committee  was held on the 28th July, when it was recommended that the periods of institutional trainingin tuning and repairing and in violin making should be extended from six to twelve months. Attention was also directed to the prejudicial effect on the prospects of the training scheme of the continued importation of German pianos under  present conditions  of exchange.    Vehicle  Building. A meeting of  the  National Trade  Advisory Committee was held on the 28th July, and the Revised Report approved by the committee is now going forward for departmental sanction.   The  committee urged very strongly that the preliminaryperiod of training in certain  processes be  extended to nine months, and the total periodof training with maintenance be increased to 18&apos;months,
Ex-Service  Men-continued.Local Technical Advisory Committees.    Electricity, Power and Light-k. committee is being formed at Blackpool, the functionsof which will be mainly in connection with the  training at the Convalescent Centre.    Printing. A joint conference of the Local Technical Advisory Committees for Derby,Leicester and  Nottingham, attended by the  secretary of the  National Trade AdvisoryCommittee, was held at Leicester on the  26th July.  It was agreed that the facilities at&apos;the Leicester School of Art should be used to the fullest extent and that, in the event ofthese facilities proving inadequate, a further conference should be held.                            WOMEN&apos;8 TRAINING.General.    Filling of Vacancies. In order to use to the best advantage the remainder of the grant for women&apos;s training and to minimise delay, it has been agreed with the employment department that all forms of application filled in at Employment Exchanges shall be despatched direct  to  the Women&apos;s Training Headquarters.  In this way vacancies in existing courses are being filled, wherever practicable, by specially selected applicants andit  can be ascertained whether there  exists sufficient  demand for training to justify the renewal or initiation of a course.    Extended Schemes (London). In  the London area 435 women, will benefit from theextension of various schemes for the continuation of training after the 30th June.    Domestic Training (Wales). Satisfactory reports have been received from Wales onthe placing in employment of trainees in the various domestic classes.  Their services havebeen  sought after  and good wages have been  obtained.  The majority have  gone intoresident posts and, with the exception of those whose domestic circumstances have prevented from going into employment at all, very few have failed to take up some kind of domesticwork.    Dressmaking and Tailoring Centre (Kingston). The classes at Kingston have recentlybeen visited and were found to be working very satisfactorily.  Very varied work was being done and the finished garments were well above the usual standard of beginners&apos; work.    &quot; Home Helps &quot;  Scheme  (Newcastle). The women trained under  this  scheme were referred to the local Home Helps Committee for employment on the  completion of their course.   The secretary of the committee reports that their work is excellent and has been much appreciated in the districts to which  they have been sent.   The committee are now considering a proposal to  train other women in the autumn, in co-operation with thecommittee on infant  and child  welfare under the health authority, who have  at presentthe exclusive services of some of the women trained.War Widows and Dependants.    Closure of the Scheme. The scheme for training the widows and dependants of officersand men who have been killed or have died as a result  of war  service has now been inoperation for three and a half years.  Applications for training continue to be receivedbut it has been agreed with the Ministry of Pensions to set a time limit after which noapplications may be accepted.   The 15th October has been fixed as the limiting date.    Treasury sanction has  been obtained to the provision, where necessary,  of sewingmachines for war widows who have completed training in dressmaking, to enable them toset up in business on their own account.  Hitherto grants for this purpose have been made from  the King&apos;s Fund, administered  by  the Ministry of  Pensions, but this Fund is nowexhausted.    During the week 21 new applications have been received, bringing the total to 2,476.In 23 further cases training was authorised, bringing the total  of  sanctions to  1,380.Nineteen applications were rejected or withdrawn and there were three withdrawals fromtraining.    At the end of the week there were 359  war widows in training and 651 had completed their  training.    Since the transfer of training powers to the Ministry of Labour on the 1st September,1919, 1,240 applications from war widows  have been received.  During the same  period663 have been sanctioned, and 754 have been rejected or withdrawn.    (B 16322)                                                            2 F  2
WomeiTs  Training-continued.Disabled Nurses.    During the week a number of disabled nurses have been interviewed and training hasbeen sanctioned in five cases.  One nurse in receipt of a pension &quot; until further orders &quot;which, it appears, is the nearest approach to a permanent pension awarded as yet, has beengranted a year&apos;s course  in housekeeping  at  the  School  of Domestic Economy, AthollCrescent, Dublin.  Of the four other courses, two are for poultry farming, one for secretarialwork and one for dispensing.    Poultry farming is considered by the medical  authorities of the Ministry of pensions to be the most suitable training for shell-shock cases.  The training  given is of various types;  on a farm with a private individual where practical work is  taught; on  farmswhere preparation for a Board of Agriculture examination is given;  and at agriculturalcolleges.                         APPRENTICES  AND  BOYS.                        INTERRUPTED  APPRENTICESHIPS. The Position in the Scottish Plumbing Trade.     Edinburgh. Lord Hunter&apos;s decision is to the effect that the scheme for interrupted apprenticeships  is operative and binding upon  the parties to the reference, as from the 1st January, 1919.*  He has thus vindicated the interpretation of the position as given by the Industrial Council for the industry, and upheld the attitude adopted by the department in their administration of the scheme. Questions Affecting the Scheme.     Wages. In the Pembroke Dock district, the drapery trade is expected not to require any apprentices for the present, owing to the Trade Board rates.  Employers will probably endeavour to take smaller numbers in future by reason of the high wages.   A probable reduction in the number of apprentices in Government dockyards also helps to render the outlook unpromising in the district.     Prescribed Rate. A question  has arisen with Messrs. Merry weather &amp;  Sons,  Ltd., Greenwich, engineers, in regard to the recent award of 3s. per week to the  engineering industry by the Industrial Court.  The firm maintain that this is not payable to apprenticesunder the scheme, and, in support of their view, they produce a letter from the Court,stating that the award applies  to workmen other than apprentices.  They interpret thelatter term to cover apprentices of 21 or over who  are under the scheme.  They are perfectlywilling, however, to pay the award, but require first to have definite information that theformer ruling, as they interpret it, has been reversed.  The Joint Committee in the Engineer-ing Industry  have decided that these advances are payable to men under the scheme.     Period of Renewed Training.--Messrs. J. &amp; T. Scott, Edinburgh,  cabinet makers, makethe suggestion that, in the case of dull boys and others who are below the average, extensions of training should be allowed beyond the normal periods.  This, however, is not possible under the terms  of the scheme.     Apprentices  without Employers.-Numerous apprentices have not yet found employersunder the scheme, and the weekly returns received show a,large excess of apprentices&apos;applications over those of employers.   The department have obtained a general return fromall the Employment Exchanges of such apprentices, still on their registers, which, for theperiod up to the  middle of June, shows 1,812 &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices.The  Scheme in Operation.     Statistics. Up to the 28th July, 41 schemes  had been approved,  and applications havebeen received in respect of all of them.   The number of applications received at Exchangesfrom employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 19th July, was 242, making a totalof 42,350.   The number of applications received  from apprentices was 296, making a totalof 47,542.                         * See this Report, No. 19, 5th June, p. 655,
 Apprentices and Boys--continued.     Up to the 28th July, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 40,724 apprentices.   Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 39,152 apprentices, employed by 15,495  employers.  Of these 14,035 were under the engineering scheme, and 6,506 under the  building scheme.  The total number of agreements lapsed  on the expiration of the appropriate  period  of training,  or by mutual  agreement between  the  parties,  is now 8,094.     Eligibility. Six ex-Service men, who are employed by the  Gloucester Aircraft Co., Ltd., upon semi-skilled work, and paid labourers&apos;rates, complained of not receiving the benefits of the scheme.  Their case has been investigated by a representative of the National Society of Brass Workers and Metal Mechanics, who reports that, but for their military service, they would now be equal to the average journeyman in this union.   They would thus appear to be covered by the provision which brings within the scheme persons learning a  skilled trade, though not formally apprenticed.   The works manager is willing to bring them under the scheme, and to give their training  his special  attention.  A meeting of the shop stewards and the secretaries of the trade unions concerned also agreed to render every possible assistance.  The department have agreed to bring the men under the scheme. *     A somewhat similar position is reported in the case of the Gloucester railway Carriage and Wagon Co., Ltd., this firm have been accustomed to engage boys in their smithy and other departments without any definite guarantee of training ;  but, as they  were engaged in a skilled trade, many of them became tradesmen.   The trade unions concerned have recently pressed for a regular system for training these boys, when once they pass the initial stages.  The firm have inquired, therefore, if those who have been in the Forces are eligible under the scheme, and the journeymen are desirous that it should be applied to them. These men also have been accepted by the department.     The engineering employers in. the Stroud area have raised the case of three disabled apprentices, who  cannot complete their apprenticeship in its original form, but are not prevented altogether from resuming their trade.   It had originally been proposed to deal with them as disabled men, but the employers now consider that it will be better for them to complete  their training under  the scheme in the lighter branches of their pre-war trades. It is proposed, therefore, that  one  turner, who owing to leg injuries cannot  return to the lathe, shall qualify as a fitter, another  turner as a miller,  and an agricultural smith as a fitter, since his trade  comprises usually both  smithing and fitting.  A further reason for the proposal is the difficulty in training disabled men for the engineering industry in the South- Western area.     The Portsmouth Employment Committee  have raised  the  case  of certain appren- tices, who were accepted for the army as tradesmen and discharged before the completion of their training.   The department have been in communication with the War Office on the  matter.  It has  been  ascertained that the  men  in  question were discharged, on medical grounds, and the scheme does not apply to cases  of this character, in which an apprenticeship was commenced during,  and  not previous to, service in the Forces.     Acceptance or  Non-Acceptance. Local headquarters for the North-Western area have been informed by the Colne branch of the Co-operative Wholesale Society that the head office of the society have instructed local branches to bring all eligible apprentices  under the scheme.     At  Elswick, further investigation has been made regarding the 55 apprentices of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth  &amp; Co., Ltd., who  complain of not being brought under the scheme.   Three prove to be eligible pre-war apprentices of the firm, and will be brought under the scheme as  soon as possible.   Five others, whilst eligible, were not in the firm&apos;s employment before enlistment, and they are not prepared to engage them, in view of the fact  that  they are being compelled to discharge  numbers of their own men.  One was discharged for misconduct!  Eighteen others are employed, at full journeyman&apos;s rates undera special arrangement with the trade unions concerned.  The firm state that the remaining 28 were  reinstated on their return, but subsequently left  of their own free will after receiving journeyman&apos;s lines.  They also state that they  have reinstated 445 apprentices out of a total of  540, and that the remainder by their own choice did  not return to them.     Training in Operation: Progress. Local headquarters  for the South-Western  area report that inspections of training by  the  department are likely to lead to  permanentimprovements in methods of training.   Generally speaking,  the  facilities for training inthis  area are  excellent, but cases  are stated not to be uncommon  in which, though thefacilities are there, the power of managing apprentices seems to be absent.    Training continues to be generally  good and the apprentices  make good headway, i
 Apprentices and Boys-continued. the Northern, and the South Midlands and Eastern areas.   Reports are still satisfactory on the whole in the London and South-Eastern area and local headquarters for the North-Western area refer to appreciations of the scheme  by employers and  apprentices.    Trade Disputes. An interesting point has arisen in connection with the joiners&apos; strike in  Scotland,  by an inquiry from the Coatbridge  Employment Committee whether ex-Service apprentices can be asked to work overtime.  Hitherto they have been permitted to remain at work; but local  headquarters consider .that  any  attempt on the part of employers to take advantage of this  concession in such a manner may lead to their being withdrawn from the shops.                              GENERAL TRAINING. Apprentices: Conditions and Training.    Wheelwrights (Liverpool). Though technical classes for wheelwrights have been in existence for some years, the trade locally has not regarded them as adequate.  In October, 1919, they arranged therefore with the Liverpool Education Committee for a special technical class for apprentices between 15 and  18 years of  age.  This class  is  limited to 20 selectedapprentices,  who attend for one full day per week.  For this they  receive full payment,and the employers also pay a fee of  1 for each apprentice, and supply the timber required.This is the first day-time class for apprentices organised by any trade in Liverpool.  Thelocal education authority are much interested in  it in anticipation of wider developmentsunder the Education Act, 1918.    Recruiting of Large Firms from Small. It has been customary for boys to be trained in various trades in large numbers in country districts of the South-Western area, in whichtrade unionism is weak or non-existent.  Hence the proportion of apprentices is very high,and as many as 10 apprentices to one journeyman are  by no  means  unknown ;  and manyof them cannot subsequently find employment locally.  The  large industrial centres draw their apprentices very largely from these sources and themselves  do little training.  Thisis not confined indeed to the bigger centres in the area itself. Certain  trades in London,for instance, are believed to be largely recruited from these country districts.  In Penzance,200 boys have been trained for engineering in the last 10 years, but only two have foundlocal employment, and in Bristol, although the industry was estimated to be able to absorb50 boys per annum, only three local openings for apprentices could be found. Local head-quarters, however, confirm a previous report that the bigger  furniture firms in the Barn-staple district are now taking measures to train their  own apprentices.  This may seriously affect such places as Bideford and Torrington, upon which in the past they have relied.

INDUSTRIES   DEPARTMENT.                    INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS DIVISION.               JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS. Industrial.     Cooperage. The Council met on the 27th July.  The secretary reported that all the District Councils had been formed, and had held their initial meetings.   It was resolved that coopers employed in Norwich and  in South Wales should be paid Id. per hour above the basic rate of 2s. Id.   Dissatisfaction was expressed at the refusal of the War Office and the Admiralty to pay the rates fixed by the Council, and it was decided to address a protest to the Ministry of Labour, and to request  the War Office and the Admiralty to receive a deputation  on  the subject.     The CounciFs permission has been asked by the Training Department to start training disabled men  for  the dry side of the industry.  The Council,  however,  were convinced that the industry was not suitable on account of the arduous nature of the work and the scarcity of  employment.     A sub-committee was  appointed to prepare a special scheme for insurance against unemployment in accordance with the terms of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.     It was  resolved that the Coopers&apos;, Brewers&apos;, Vintners&apos; and Distillers&apos; Companies and the City and Guilds of London Institute should be  approached, with a view to obtaining their co-operation in  providing for the technical education of apprentices.     The Council decided to  endorse the resolution of the  Iron  and Steel Wire  Manu- facturing Council  in condemnation  of  the  Employment Exchanges, and  the protest of the  Pottery Council against the  taxation  of sums spent on  structural  alterations  and additions for the  welfare  requirements of operatives.     Electricity Supply. The District Council for the South Coast area met  on the  26th July.  Schedules of rates of pay and working conditions were completed.  The question as to the date from which the rates shall become operative  was referred to the National Council for  decision.     Glass. The Home Secretary  on the 28th July received a joint deputation from the National Council and the St. Helens Plate and Sheet Glass Industrial Council,  relative to the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill.   The Home Secretary, in announcing that no further progress would  be  made until  the autumn,  assured  the deputation that the claims of the industry for exceptional treatment would receive most careful consideration.   It was also proposed, he added, to set up a departmental committee to explore the whole question of the employment of women in two shifts, and the Council would be asked to give evidence.    Local Authorities&apos;  Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England  and Wales).- The District Council for Kent, Surrey, East Sussex and West  Sussex met on the 27th July. Proposals for the grading of  the various authorities,  and  for minimum rates, were  con- sidered.  The  employers&apos; side offered to agree upon five rates, to be paid according to locality, namely,  50s.  lid!., 54s. 10d., 58s. 9d., 62s. Sd. and 66s.  Id.  The workpeople&apos;s side rejected the  offer and claimed a flat minimum rate of Is. 9d.  per hour to be paid throughout  the area.  The matter has  been referred to the National Council for settle- ment.  The  Council has been successful in settling wages  disputes in Eastbourne  and Deal.    The District  Council for the  Midlands  Area met on the 28th July to consider  the report of a committee  on grading and basic rates.  After a prolonged discussion no agree- ment was reached, and the Council adjourned sine  die, the chairman being given power to call a meeting when he considered it expedient.    The District Council for Yorkshire  (North and  East Ridings)  met on the 29th July. The local authorities in the  area were  divided into  grades, and a  sub-committee  was appointed to fix minimum rates of pay for  each grade.    Needle,  Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The  Council met on the 27thJuly.   The  question of homework was discussed,  and it was decided that the council should write to the employers&apos; association requesting that drastic action should be taken.The  employers&apos; representatives stated  that their wages committee  would give  a finaldecision on the grading scheme when the observations of all members of  the employers&apos;association had been received. The trade union side complained of the  delay, but  the
* See also p. 203 above employers pointed out that in any event the award would be retrospective.  It was stated that the fish-hook makers&apos;  six months&apos; agreement was expiring, and they required to be included in the new grading scheme.  It was decided to notify the secretary of the em- ployers&apos; association accordingly.     The Council appointed a deputation to the Ministry on the question of the appoint- ment of the manager of the Redditch Employment  Exchange  as independent chairman of the Council.   The deputation was received on the 29th July, when the matter was dis- cussed, and the departments objections to the proposal were stated.     Printing. The decision reached by the  Council at their meeting on the 22nd July has not succeeded in preventing a dispute in the  Manchester and Liverpool  districts. The  local members of the Typographical Association  persist  in refusing  to obey the instructions of their central executive who do not feel strong enough to carry on in those districts with loyal members.  The employers, with  the concurrence of the trade union leaders, decided to issue lock-out notices to all Manchester and Liverpool members of the Typographical Association  on the 30th  July, the notices expiring  in 14 days.   This is not intended to affect members of other printing unions, and the employers have started a guarantee fund to reimburse Manchester and Liverpool employers the wages they may pay to their workers deprived of employment through the lock-out.*     The Unemployment Sub-Committee met  on the 26th July to consider what  evidence should be given to the  Committee of Inquiry on Employment Exchanges.     Quarrying:  Slate Section. On the 23rd July  an  Arbitration  Court,  composed of members chosen from the panel in accordance with the new Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme recently adopted by the Council, and presided over by Lord Askwith as independent chairman, sat in London.  They heard representatives of both parties in a dispute arising out of a claim  to an advance in wages and an alteration in certain working conditions put forward by the North Wales Quarrymen&apos;s Union and opposed by the North Wales Slate Quarry Owners&apos; Association.  The Court made an award which was immediately repu- diated by the representatives of both parties, who then  came to an agreement, and drew up an adaptation of the award, which is to be submitted to their respective associations for ratification.     Waterworks Undertakings. The District Council for North Wales met  on the 22nd July.  Formal business was considered and  officers  were appointed.   The trade  union side gave notice of an application to fix minimum rates  of pay for all grades.     Wire Manufacture.-Tlie Council met on the 27th July.  A discussion  arose on the question of extra  pay for  night work.   The chairman  announced  that a ballot of the employers&apos; association showed a large majority in favour of retaining present conditions. The trade union side stated that in many parts of  the country their constituents were not in favour  of ceasing night work until the question had been settled in their favour. The question was adjourned in order that the trade unions might consult their members.    The trade unions complained of the different practices which existed on the question of overtime, and asked that uniformity might be introduced.   The chairman suggested that this was a question that should first be discussed by District Councils, and the trade union  representatives asked leave  to  adjourn the  meeting in order that they might co-ordinate the questions-of overtime and extra pay for night work, and put them before their  constituents  as a  national issue.       JOINT  STANDING  INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS:  WORKS COMMITTEES.    flour milling. A representative of the Ministry attended a  meeting of the Southern Area Flourmillers&apos; Association, which had nothing but praise for the works committees, now re-modelled in accordance with the recommendations of the Council, and operatingthroughout the district.  Works committees were originally formed  over two years ago, at a time  when the  employees  were unorganised.   The committees encouraged  tradeunionism, until now all  the  workers belong to the National Union of Millers.    Members of the Surrey and Sussex and South  Coast  Area Joint  District  council were interviewed and information as to  the  present state  of the works  committees  inthe areas was obtained.   Joint works committees have been established by  two  mills inEllesmere Port,  one  in  Liverpool,  one in Seacombe,  one in Southampton and two  inLondon.
(B 16322)     Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. Various members of the Sheffield Master Silversmiths&apos; Association were interviewed with a view to furthering the proposed scheme for works committees in the industry.  It is hoped the association may soon take definite action to establish committees.  A meeting of shop stewards of the East London Stick- makers&apos;  Section of the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades was addressed, and decided in favour of the formation of works committees.

Following  a meeting held to consider the advisability of  forming a Council for the fishing industry of the Port of Grimsby, the drafting  committee met on the 25th July.  It had been decided in view of the  special circumstances of this industry to begin with the formation of a Council for the one port  in the  expectation  that  it might be followed  by  similar bodies at other centres.  A General Council was formed, but it will mostly sit in six panels which will represent the interests, respectively, of share-fishermen, weekly hands, enginemen and firemen, curers and salters, smokers and lumpers.  Matters which  cannot be settled by the panels will be referred to the Council.     Lock, Latch and  Key Trade. The Midland Lock and Latch Trade Wages Board met&apos; on the 30th  July to discuss the advisability of constituting the Board as a Council for the lock, latch and key trade.  After an  address by a representative  of the department, the Board  decided to recommend to its constituent bodies  that  it should  be merged into a Council.

At a meeting of  the Home workers  Sub-Committee it was decided  that before any minimum rates for  homcworkers were recommended, employers of these workers should be consulted,&apos;and  that an official inquiry should be made regarding  the rates at present paid and their  yield.      The Board met to consider whether, in view of an objection lodged by one of their  members to certain of the rates which the Board at a previous meeting had resolved to  propose, they should amend such rates before the  Notice of Proposal was actually issued.  No agreement  was reached,  but  after the  meeting  the appointed  members and  representatives of workers visited the factory of the employer in question in order to see  the work.      A letter from the Employment Department  on the subject of the Unemployment  Insurance Bill was considered and the Board decided not to  make any recommendations  in regard to its provisions.      Paper  Box Trade Board (Great Britain). The  London District &apos;Trade Committee  considered the proposal of the Board to vary minimum  rates for certain classes of male  workers and to fix overtime rates for male and female workers, and agreed to recommend  the Board to vary and to fix rates as set out in the Notice  of Proposal dated the 29th  May.  The  committee considered the Board&apos;s proposal to vary and fix minimum rates  of wages for female workers formulated  at a  meeting of the Board held  on the 9th July.  Separate recommendations were  made by the representatives of workers and employers.  The committee also considered the advisability of  fixing general minimum pieCe-rates for  homeworkers and the Board&apos;s recommendation that a list of piece-rates  should be drawn  up  if possible.  The  committee agreed to take no action.      At  a joint meeting of the Manchester,  Liverpool and Leeds District Trade  Com-  mittees, the rates proposed in the Notice issued on the 29th  May and at the  meeting of  the Board held on the  9th July,  were considered.  The committee agreed to recommend the Board to vary the general minimum time-rates for  a  certain class  of male workers  and to fix overtime rates for male and female workers as set out in the Notice dated the 29th May.

Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to fix, vary and cancel certain minimum piece-rates for male and female workers in accordance with their Notice of Proposal dated the 10th May.  The question of the application to female workers of the general minimum piece-rates fixed for male workers was referred to a sub-committee. On the recommendation of the Administrative Committee it was resolved to reply to the Minister that it was unlikely that there would be any difficulty  in dealing with applications for permits of exemption, but that, if necessary,  use should  be  made of the  services of Local Employment Committees for investigating the facts.     It was similarly resolved that, for the time being, the question of formulating a special scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Bill should be  deferred.     The Board also adopted a scheme of training prepared by the Administrative Committee for male&apos; late entrants into  the trade.     The Board considered  a motion of which notice had been given by representatives of workers that all minimum rates fixed by the Board should be increased by 25 per cent., but  after discussion the matter was adjourned until the next  meeting of the Board.     Ready-made and Wholesale  Bespoke Tailoring Trade  Board (Great  Britain). The Board considered the objections lodged against their Proposal dated the  17th May, with regard to  the minimum rates of wages for male workers and  unanimously agreed to fix the rates as proposed, subject to certain modifications with respect to overtime rates and the definition of porters, necessitated by the explanation given by  the  Ministry of the rates which a Trade Board is empowered to fix.     The Board also  considered a letter from  the Ministry on the proposed amendment of the regulations to allow of voting by sides, and passed a resolution asking the Ministerto take steps to amend  the regulations.

The question of amending the Rope, Twine and Net Order, 1919, was considered bythe Board and it was agreed  to  inform the department that the Board desired that netmenders should be brought within the scope of the Board and that beatsters should beinformed that they had been  so  included.  No objection was raised  by the Board to theMinisters proposal to include within the scope of the Board to be established for the made-up textile trade the splicing of rope  when  that operation  was performed by  workersordinarily employed on work  within the scope of such  Board.    The Board agreed to appoint a committee,  consisting of two  representatives from each side, and the deputy chairman, to consider, in conjunction with representatives ofthe Flax and Hemp and the Jute Trade Boards the advisability of formulating one special scheme of unemployment insurance to cover the various trades affected by these  twoBoards, and other cognate branches of the trade.

The number of  awards issued during the week was seventeen, twelve under  the Industrial Courts Act, three under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, as amended by the Industrial Courts Act, and two by single arbitrators. Industrial Court.     Water Board Employees (London).-The Court in adjudicating upon the claim took into consideration the nature of the duties performed and the high standard of integrity and trustworthiness expected of employees, together with other points of difference between municipal and ordinary commercial undertakings.   An advance was granted  of 8s. a full ordinary week to men over 21 years of age and to  those under that age  who  are ordinarily and fully employed on men&apos;s work.  For the purpose of  superannuation this advance should be regarded as war bonus.  (Award No. 411.)     Railway Electrical  Workers. Separate  claims were made by the Electrical Trades Union and the National Union of Railwaymen^with regard to the rates of wages and  the working conditions of men employed in generating stations connected with railways in Great Britain.  In the first case the Court confirmed the  agreement between the parties on various points and further decided that the wages of men employed on the maintenance of railway workshop power stations should be governed by the shop rates for craftsmen; that the conditions of service both for maintenance  men and operating staff should be the shop conditions; and that the length of holidays  after twelve months&apos; service should be seven consecutive  days with  one week&apos;s pay for  shift-workers, and three consecutive days with three days&apos; pay for probationers.  In the second  case it was decided that  the rates and  conditions  of service instituted under Award No. 2773 of the  Committee on Production should be confirmed, and that rates in the provinces should be 10 per cent. less than London rates, except in Glasgow, Liverpool  and  Manchester, where they should be 5 per cent, less than London rates.   With regard to railway workshop power station workers&apos; and shift-workers&apos; holidays, decisions were given similar to those which appear above.    Both decisions are effective as from the 1st December, 1919.  (Awards No. 414 and 416.)     Tramway Employees (London County Council).-Claims that men in the running sheds should be paid in accordance with awards relating to the  engineering and foundry trade, and a claim for an advance to slingers, were held not to have been established.  (Awards No. 417, 418  and 419.)    Hosiery  Trade (Scotland). -Advances were granted to time-workers, of 8s. per week to men, and 5s. a week to women, 3s. per week to boys and girls between 16 and 18 years of age, and 2s. per week to boys and girls between 14 and 16 years of age.    Present piece- work prices were advanced by 15 per cent.  At Ha wick the present percentage advance of 37j was increased to 57j.  (Awards Nos. 422 and 423.)                       AGREEMENTS  AND  SETTLEMENTS.    Milk Carriers (London). A strike of milk carriers occurred in South London on the 25th July,  as  a protest against the dismissal of a branch manager employed by the  United Dairies Co., Ltd.   At  the same time the milk carriers in the  North London district came out; in sympathy, stating also that they claimed reinstatement for a foreman who had been dismissed by the Manor Farm Dairy, Ltd. The Chief Conciliation Officer held conferences between the parties, as a result of which the strike was called off, and work was resumed on the 28th July.  The dismissals of the two men in question are to stand good.    Basket Makers (Yorkshire).-An agreement has been reached between the Yorkshire Employers&apos; Association  and the Yorkshire  United Skip,  Basket and Hamper Makers&apos; Society  by which a further increase of 18 per cent, has been granted on the Yorkshire list, making a total advance of 158 per cent, on piece-rates and 173 per cent,  on time-rates. This has been made retrospective to the  19th July,  1920, and arrangements have been made for the  addition of a sliding scale based on a variation of 10 per cent, in the cost-of-living figure.
                                       227                               7.8.20.                   QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.    Boot Last Workers (Midlands). At a meeting of the Boot and Shoe Last Manufacturers&apos;Association and the Workers&apos; Union, held at Leicester on the 23rd July, a resolution waspassed unanimously that if  the last makers now on  strike  at the works of the BritishAmerican Last Co., Northampton, failed to return to  work by the 9th August, a generallock-out in  the industry  would ensue, affecting the towns of  Leicester, Northampton,Kettering, Norwich and Bristol.   The result of the ballot of the workers concerned was69 to 1 in favour of continuing the strike.  At this meeting the question of general advances in wages  was discussed, and the employers informed the union that the unsatisfactory state of trade in the boot and shoe industry would not allow of any increases being grantedto boot last  makers.    Glass&quot;Workers (Gastleford). Messrs. J. Lumb &amp; Co., Ltd., are still determined to standby the terms  of the disputed award. Themen&apos;s attitude is that the Court have not graspedthe position in regard to the basic rate upon which the 15 per cent, advance was given.They  contend that it should have been given on the rates ruling  at the date of their application, the 19th April, and not on the 1915 list  prices.  As the award provides forthe advances taking effect on the piece-rates existing in July, 1915, the actual advance onthe rates  ruling  in April,  1920,  represents 8j per cent. only.  The  Chief  ConciliationOfficer has been instructed to urge on the union the necessity for securing that the awardis observed for  a reasonable period.    Tramway Workers  (Newport).- he  permanent-way employees   of  the NewportCorporation Tramways Committee struck work on the 12th July to enforce their demandfor  the Grade A building trade unskilled rate of 26&apos;. Id. per hour as from the 1st July.The Corporation made an offer of Is.  8d. per hour, which was rejected.   Members of theNational Union  of  General  Workers  employed at the power station took sympatheticaction  on  the 27th July, cutting off the electric supply from the tramways, for lightingpurposes and from, various works dependent on the public supply.    The Chief Conciliation Officer was able to arrange a meeting between the Mayor andthe local organiser of the union.  As a result, the Mayor, with an officer of the department,attended a mass meeting of the men on the 30th July.   It was  arranged that the power men* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 3, 17th July, p. 125.    Women Screw Makers (Birmingham). In an attempt to secure payment under theCourt of Arbitration, Award No. 504, the women members of the Workers&apos; Union, at theestablishment of Messrs. Robson, Ltd., Birmingham, screw manufacturers, went on strike on the 17th May.   The firm, who are  non-federated, refused the demand.  At the requestof both parties the department intervened and seemed an agreement that work was tobe resumed on the 6th August, the firm to continue to pay the same wages as when thestrike commenced, and in the event of the Workers&apos; Union arriving at an agreement withthe screw manufacturers&apos; association for an  advance  in wages, the firm to conform tothat agreement.    Gas Mantle Workers (Streatham). A strike involving approximately 130 women and girls took place at the works of Messrs. J.  T. Robins  &amp; Co., gas mantle makers,  inconsequence of the discharge  of a girl for insolence.  Other workers  took up her case and it was alleged that during the discussion which ensued, the forewoman struck oneof the girls, whereupon all the women  workers left the factory.   The department inter-intervened and a conference was  arranged  between the  employers  and  the union, which resulted in a resumption of  work.   It  was  agreed that the workers should apologise,that those who felt they could not conscientiously work under the forewoman should begiven an opportunity of taking piece-work home  on the same basis as obtained in thefactory; and that a representative of the workers  should be elected to confer with themanagement in the event of any future trouble.    Margarine  Workers (Fulham). Messrs. Van den Berghs, Ltd., are now prepared toallow resumption  of work,* at the old rate of wages plus the advance of wages they had promised, by as many workpeople as they can take.  They are prepared to give preference of employment to those on strike until they are all absorbed. When work is resumednegotiations will again be opened up with regard to the advances claimed on behalf ofthe women workers.
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 3, 17th July, p. 125 should return to work upon an agreement that the case-of the permanent-way men should be reconsidered by the Electricity Committee within a fortnight.  The track men, however, could not be persuaded to return to work on the  rates offered.     Municipal Workers  (Tunbridge  Wells): The  National Union of  General Workers made a demand early in June, on behalf  of  their  members employed by the Tunbridge Wells Town Council as pick and shovel men, for the building trade rate of Is. 9d. per hour of lieu of their present rate of Is. 3d. per hour.  The Council have refused the application and  the  union&apos;s  executive have  authorised  a strike,  hut have  approached the Chief Conciliation Officer with a view to averting  a stoppage.  The Mayor and Town Clerk will discuss the&apos; question with him.     brick makers (Carnarvon). A dispute  affecting about 60 employees occurred at the Parkia Brick Works and Seiont Brick Works, Carnarvon.  The men demanded building trade rates which the management refused. A temporary settlement was effected by the men returning to work at their old rate on the understanding that a further meeting would be held to discuss the alternative increase  offered by the firm.     Electrical Workers (Liverpool). At a meeting of the employers executive committee of the District Council it was resolved to recommend the Liverpool Corporation to request the intervention of the department in the dispute and the Corporation have written the department accordingly.  The Committee  also resolved to call  a meeting  of the District Council to be held on the 10th August.  The  Electrical Trades Union, in or desirable-to bring further pressure to bear on the employers, have called out the cable jointers employed by the Bootle, Birkenhead  and Wallasey Corporations, and  those  employed  by  the Liverpool District Lighting Co.     The Chief Concilation Officer, Manchester, is endeavouring to convene a conference.     Embroidery Workers (Enfield). A threatened strike of workpeople employed by the Enfield Embroidery Company has been averted by  a conference held under the auspices of the department.  It was agreed that the firm should submit for consideration counter proposals regarding minimum day-time rate, and providing that the maximum working week should  consist  of  46j hours,  that all Bank  holidays and additional compulsory holidays should be paid for, that no overtime should be worked, but,  if  overtime is necessary, the question of overtime rates should be further discussed, and that those in employment should be given the option of going to the machines before new employees.     The result of the consideration by the union of the employers&apos; counter-proposals is awaited.     Bone Brush Makers (London). The Bone Brush Makers&apos; Trade Protection Society&apos;s application* to the Master Bone Brush Makers&apos; Association for advances in wages has been referred to the British  Brush Manufacturers&apos;  Association, as they have received a general demand of  a similar nature.   The  last  named association have replied  that the state  of trade will not allow of any increases being granted.     The particular application was brought before the Trade Board for the industry, and the operatives somewhat modified their demands.   It is understood that the  employers&apos; side are about to  make an offer which will probably be  accepted.     Woollen Trade Dispute. The woollen trade  dispute  has advanced a little way by the definite rejection by the operatives of the employers&apos; offer  of 26f per cent, advance, on basic rates.  The department have suggested that the Joint  Industrial Council should again be convened in order to discuss the matter.   Both sides are prepared to adopt this course, and a meeting of the Council at Bradford has been arranged for the 5th August. The general  attitude  of the unions is that, unless the employers put forward amended proposals, consideration must be given to the  question of handing in strike notices.     Sawmilling Industry (Manchester). An effort is being made to arrange a joint  con-Terence of  the employers and workers concerned.     Sawmilhng Industry (East Anglia). The employers have refused to concur in referring the difference to arbitration.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, has been requested to see the secretary of the employers&apos; association.    Strike against a Foremen (Swansea). The hydraulic power and maintenance men and labour^is, in the employment of the Great Western Railway Co., at Swansea Docks, ceased work without notice on the 24th July, to enforce the removal of a foreman whom
                                         229                               T.8.*).* See this Report, No. 21, 19th June, p. 741. they accused of tyrannous conduct.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, arranged a meeting, as a result of which work was resumed on the 29th July, and the company agreed to hold an inquiry into the men&apos;s complaints.     Waste Paper Trade : Dockers and Warehouse Worlcers (London).- he representatives of the waste paper trade have refused to put into operation the rates agreed by Messrs. Lendrum,* but have agreed that the following rates shall operate for the trade as a whole from the pay day following the 2nd August:  Men, a minimum of 72s. per week ; women over 18 years, with experience of the trade, 33s., plus Qd. per day for full time.  The above rates are for a 48-hour week.  Barge work to be paid for at the dockers&apos; rate, and a scale fixed for learners aged 14 to 171 years.  A joint committee is to be set up to deal with any small items which may arise out of this settlement.     Boiler Makers (Tees-side).-Oia the 8th June, by Award No. 339, the Industrial Court decided that the  claim of  the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers for a 20 per cent, advance to  piece-rate  and lieu-rate  workers, similar to Award No. 2542 of the Committee on Production,  was not established.  It appears that since the case  was heard negotiations have been in progress between repre- sentatives of men and employers, terminating in a conference on the 17th July, when, in order to avoid a stoppage on the 23rd, the men&apos;s representatives put forward the suggestion that a  committee of inquiry be appointed to go into the whole question of the  men&apos;s grievances.  This was refused by the employers&apos; representative, on the  grounds that it was only another way to obtain the 20 per cent, increase, and the men decided to cease work on the 21st July.  The Chief Conciliation Officer discussed the situation with the assistant secretary of the union, and afterwards with the secretary, and suggested that efforts should be made by  the department to  arrange a further conference, composed of a representative and of a worker from each firm concerned.   The secretary agreed to discuss the suggestion with the local representatives of the men.  In the meantime the men had been instructed by telegram to continue  or resume work.  On the 22nd July a meeting of the men was addressed by their representatives, and those who were on strike were urged to resume work.   It is understood that the resumption has been general.     White Marl Workers (Potteries). The operatives&apos; union have withdrawn their notices for a stoppage tendered to the marl owners&apos; association on account of the refusal  of the latter to call a meeting of the Joint Defence Board to discuss the recent agreement arrived at for marl workers.  These notices were due to expire on the 24th July, but have been temporarily withdrawn by the  district officials  of the union in.view of correspondence which is taking place between the employers&apos; association and the headquarters of the union.   It is unlikely that any drastic action will be taken by  the local union without further instructions from headquarters.
