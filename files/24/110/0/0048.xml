CABINET. 4Ii^li^^^emorandum by the Food Controller.1*--:--         At their meeting on the 29th July the Cabinet decided thatarrangements should be made to ensure the abolition of the bread subsidyby the end of the present calendar year, the price of the loaf to beraised gradually during the next five months so as to secure that thesubsidy  terminatad  on the 31st December, 1920.  It was further agreedthat no  public announcement of this decision should be made.         After careful consideration of the  practical application of thisI decision, I desire to make the following observations j     (1)  The policy of secrecy is incompatible with a policy Of gradual reduction.,  If the reduction is to commence on the 6th September, the   necessary literature must be in the hands of District Food Officersby the 20th August, if the printing can be got through in time.   Leakagethereafter is inevitable, and the Press is already actively enquiring intcthe matter.  I am of opinion that if the policy of successive reductionsis adhered to it should be announced and explained in the House ofCommons  before Parliament rises next week.   (2) As compared with the policy of successive reductions I suggestthat both for political and administrative reasons either one clean cutnow, i.e., 6th September, or two steps, one now and the other at the endof the financial year, would be preferable.  I feel it would be a mistake to permit the price of bread to reach its highest at the gloomiest periodof the year * December - when there is no prospect of any seasonal reduce[tions  of food prices.       Administratively the difficulties involved in successive steps are:-        (a) Successive steps constitute a continued stimulus to hoarding         on an extensive scale(which would create comment but would be         impossible to prevent.)        (b)  The accounting difficulties, which are always considerable,         are increased by the number of adjustments of price and become         more acute if these adjustments are successive and continuous.         Successive  adjustments of wages under Conciliation Board agrees         ments would also become necessary*   Whatever the decision of the Cabinet may be as to the date or method     by which the subsidy is to be  finally abolished, it is not possibleIto state the exact amount to be expended for the current financial year.This figure is necessarily governed by the world price of Wheat butassuming that the liquidation of stocks involves neither profit nor loss[the  following estimates can be given r-                                               Amount of subsidy for 19S0-k; Total abolition on Sept. 6th ............        21,  0,060         21IB. Abolition by three steps ,(2d. - 2d. -Id.   on  6th Sept., 4th Oct., and 1st Nov.) ..        26,250,000jO. Abolition by two steps. (3d. on  6th   Sept. - 2d . on 31st March) ............        38,000,000  I  am myself in favour of the &quot;two steps&quot; policy.   It will effect aconsiderable saving to the Exchequer without causing the sudden shock ofPl/5d.  loaf.                                     CHARLES  A.
