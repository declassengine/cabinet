COPY OF TELEGRAM FORWARDED TO THE LEAGUE OF  NATIONS          BY THE POLISH LEGATION IN LONDON.  9th AUGUST.  1920.                       Ciroulatea  for Information.               The Secretary General has tho  honour to forward     herewith for the information  of the Members of the Council     copy of a telegram whioh has  been forwarded by the Polish     Legation in London.TELEGRAM.Warsaw, August 7th. 8 p.m.  Received by Polish Legation,London,8/8,          The text of the note of the Polish Government to theSoviet Government  (communicated yesterday) could not be trans-mi tted to the Soviets on August 5, owing to the refusal of the moscow Radiostation of accepting it under pretext of not being able to accept it during the late hours of the night.  TheSoviet authorities fixed the hour when they would be willingto accept the radio at 5 p.m. on August 6.  Notwithstandingthis flagrant proof of wilful delay, the Polish Ministry ofForeign Affairs gave orders that the radio be transmitted atthe time thus fixed, but a new refusal of acceptance of the telegram was then made, under pretext that the Moscow Radio-station was out of order owing to a weakening of current calledforth by bad weather.  This alleged state of things did not however prevent direct communication between the tworadiostations.          Considering these circumstances, as well as thegeneral attitude of the Soviets, the Polish Government  sent the following telegram to the League of Nations:-
&quot;Sir Eric Drummond. Secretary General, League of Nations, San Sebastian. As member of the League,  the Polish Governs-nt begs to inform the League of Nations officially that in spite of the declarations made by  the  Polish Govern- ment on July 6,  to the Supreme  Council and  in spite of repeated  efforts to obtain an  armistice and an  equitableand  durable  peace  with the  Government ofthe  Soviets,  the attitude of the latter hasrendered the  cessation of hostilitiesimpossible.   Under  various  false pretextsthe  Soviet Government  has hithertorefused to negotiate conditions  for an armistice.   In spite of this, the PolishGovernment has not and will not  cease tomake every possible effort towards arriving at the conclusion of an honourable peace settlement but have to decline any res-ponsibility for the further continuation of hostilities and consider that this responsibility rests entirely with theSoviet Government.&quot;          (Signed)   Sapieha,                  Minibter of Foreign Affairs                   of  the  republic of Poland.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.     August 13th, 1920.
