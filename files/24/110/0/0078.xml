CONFIDENTIAL.    M  KORAN D$&apos;U by the RUSSIAN  TRADE G0M11ITTEE      on the draft Trading Agreement  (prepared  in  the Board      of Trade) between His Britannic Majesty&apos;8  Government      and the Russian Soviet Government.      Compiled as the result of a meeting  held  on  -Saturday,      the 14th August,  1920.      Kr.      Wise (in tha-Chair) together with/$representatives      of the Department oJT&quot;Overseas Trade, Treasury, Ministry      6&apos;f Munitions j Home Office, Admiral by, War Office,  ,      Colonial office and General post  Office,       The Russian Trade Committee expresses no opinion  on the question of policy involved in entering into commercial rela- tions with Russia.  The Committee is merely concerned with the ^erms to be included in a Trading Agreement if the Cabinet decides that such an Agreement is desirable.       The Representative of the Admiralty on the  Committee expressed,  on behalf of his Department, the view  that the resumption of trading relations oould not  be effective pending the conclusion of a  full peace treaty.       The Representative of the War  Office stated that  he had received instructions  to take no part  in  the discussion;       The representative of the Treasury  stated that he was not in a position to express the considered views of his Dept. but would  endeavour to indicate what those c.views would probably  be.       r-tche. Representative of the Home  Office said that  ho had no authority to express the views of the  Home office on.the Draft Trade Agreement  as a whole,  but  only to discuss administra tive details   The Home Office-views  would be expressed  by the Secretary of state if and when the draft  came before the Cabinet
     Apart from certain small points of a purely verbalnature, the following,points emerge     Artiole 1.   The treasury representative enquire whether it was the intention to giverTmost-favoured nation&quot;treatment to Russia.   Sir )U Clark said this was necessaryin order to safeguard our interests, the Agreement beingbilateral.   The Treasury represents: tiye. received an assur-anco that the provision of Article 1 and Article 5 wouldnot entitle Russia to demand melting and re-export licences for Russian gold.     Article 2, proviso.    The Home Office and the Admiraltyurged that powers should be taken to prevent, if desired,the orows of Russian ships coming into British ports fromlanding.     The Committee generally were of opinion that, subjectto any views which the Board of Trade might wish to express,the necessary modification should be made in the provisoto give powers to this effect.     It was pointed out that, the Agreement being bilateral,the same powers would have to apply in respect of Britishcrews on British ships entering Russian ports,     Artielo 3.   The Homo Office asked that words should beinserted which would make it compulsory for due notice to begiven as to the name of any person seeking admission,  inorder that they mi^ht have time to enquire into his case before he reached these shores.   It was decided that this could bemet by having a requirement that all entrants should be accompanied by passports vised in Russia (or in the U-K.)  bythe official Agent contemplated under Article 4,  and that no
 visa  should be  granted until authorised by the Home Office through  the passport Control Department of the foreign office,      article^^paragrapb^S,    It was.thought desirable to maintain the. present limitation of 3 kilogrammes per week instead  of 10   kilogrammes suggested in the draft.      Article 5.   The representative of the post Office pointed out that some arrangements will have to be made for reciprocal payment  for p*M^aAaa$pai telegraph messages.   He suggested that the following new clause, which was accepted by the Committee, should be inserted:-      Each party undertakes to.account for and to pay all      balances due to the ether in respect of terminal and      transit telegrams in accordance with the provisions      of  the said.international Telegraph Convention and      Regulations.      Article 8. (Debts).   The Treasury representative said that  the Treasury was strongly opposed to making any distinction between  trade debts and other debts and referred to the letter from  the Governor, sank of England, which was circulated to the Cabinet.    He pointed out that the Clause contains no provision for taking any  security from the Soviet Government and that its practical effect is to record our concurrence with the sovietfs total repudiation of all debts other than traders debts.   Sir v&apos;illiara  Clark said that the Board of Trade generally shared tho views of the Treasury, but had not been consulted before the $rime Minister  addressed to Harass in the note read by nr. Bonar Law to the  House of Commons on July  14th (Hansard page 2384, Heading  3).   The Treasury representative suggested that Clause 0 of the Agreement could,  be modified so as to apply to all dob&quot;!?s without  a  formal breach of the  note to 11.Krassin.   Sir  /illiam Clark said that it would constitute a moral breach of faith in view  of  the Prime Ministers conversations with HJlrassin,   Itwas agreed  that the question whether Article 8 should follow closely  the note as it does at present or be recast in a form
el *..that would satisfy the Bbard of Trade and the Treasurycould only be decided by the Cabinet.     Artiele 9.   The representative of the Treasury asked that the word &quot;initiate&quot; should be aibitiifcted for &quot;take orencourage&quot; in the declaration made by the British Governmentthat &quot;they will hot take or encourage any feteps  with a viewto attaching or taking possession of any gold.......&quot;This was agreed.     flew Article.   The Treasury representative  desired theaddition of an article.to ensure that the conclusion of the trading Agreement would not entitle tho Russian  Soviet repre-sentatives to obtain control of the funds of the late RussianGovernment in this country.    He promised to submit a draftclause later, but pointed out that the clause would necessarily take a.few days to draft.                                              14.8,20.
