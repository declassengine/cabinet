The propaganda was skilfully engineered bythe &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, and the great mass of the people had all sortsof fantastic beliefs;  they thought that men would be recalled tothe Colours and that one or two weak Divisions would be sent out tobe annihilated Jby the Red Army and so forth.   The result has been to rehabilitate the moderate Labour leaders with their extremesupporters and to weld the whole temporarily into one body.   The&quot;Daily Herald&quot; haa achieved an importance which it has never haasince the Railway Strike.     A National Conference of the Labour movement is to be held inLondon to-morrow to consider the policy of organised labour in theevent of a danger of war with Soviet Russia,   &apos;  The Miners1 delegates are to meet in national conference to-day to decide on a strike ballot.     The Engineers are balloting on the question of withdrawing from the present agreement for four-monthly revision of wages andwill then probably take further steps.   Feeling is ^ing -highboth among tju^m and among the gas workers.     Various British revolutionaries were present at the congress of the Third International at Moscow.   Miss Sylvia Pankhurst i&amp;reported to have reached Russia in spite of the precautions of thSiNorwegian Government to intercept her.     The excitement about 3)r, Mannix is subsiding.  There  i3 littli.doubt that if he had been allowed to land in Liverpool there wouldhave been riots.                                                       *     While the situation in Ireland continues to he had, thereare signs of great disquiet among the leaders of the Sinn  Peinmovement.
&quot;HANDS COT RUSSIA&quot; AMD &quot;(EBB DAILY  HERALD&quot;         luring the last eight days the  &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has done more    mischief than at any time since the  railway  strike.  Having the    advantage of close association with  Krassinfs mission and the    opportunity of increasing its  funds  from Bussia by faithful    service to the Soviet Government,  it has been able by skilful    perversion and suppression of  the  truth to work even the    moderate Trade Union people into a surprising state of excitement.         It is a new departure for the Labour Party to force the    hand of the Government in a matter of foreign policy, and it is    a  precedent that will not easily be  forgotten.  It is questionable    whether a general strike would have  been called, because there    are  unions,  such as  those of the engineers, who would think hard    before  they adopted  a course which would deprive them of    lucrative employment,  nor is it likely that the miners would have    favoured a strike which  would  have depleted their funds just    before  their own struggle was  to begin;, what would almost    certainly have  happened,  however,  was a combination of the    &quot;Triple  Alliance&quot; to  render the  transport of munitions impossible.         There were remarkable demonstrations against war in    practically every part of the  country and in spite of the holiday    season  audiences which generally number a hundred or so grew to    thousands.   The line  taken by  speakers shows little variation,    though  considerable perversion  of  truth.   The arguments were that    a  small  force would be sent  to  help Poland and annihilated;  that    a  further expedition would be  sent to avenge, followed by the    application  of  conscription  and  the commitments of a great war.    The irritable temper  of  sections of the working classes  was shown   by the attacks  on the  police in  the Mgware Road and by  the    treatment  at Workington  of People1s League speakers,  who were    several times removed  from their platform.   Some fifty reports.   received  on this  subject may be  summarised in the words  of my   Lancashire correspondents, who write:  &quot;Never have we known  such                                                   excitement/
      excitement  and  antagonism  to be aroused against any project      as has been aroused amongst tho workers by the possibility      of war with Russia.  On  evory hand ex-Servioe men are saying      they will never tako part  in any war again.  The workers are      dead against a  war with  Russia.&quot;          Most unfortunately  in this instance the Right and Left      wings of Labour have joined forces.  Cn the original      &quot;Committee  of Action&quot; which voted for &quot;Direct Action&quot;, the      moderates outnumbered the extremists by about two to one.      There.were  many cross-currents, but no doubt the principal      faotor was  that those moderate leaders whose popularity with      the rank and file is on  the wane seized the opportunity of     giving the  lie  to the accusations of &quot;treachery&quot; that had    &quot;been flung  at them; at any rate,  the effect has been to     rehabilitate them even with their most extreme  followers.          The question of malting public the fact that the &quot;Daily     Herald&quot; has not only accepted a subsidy from the Soviet     Government but  obtained it by a threat to swing to the Right,     is now  under consideration.THS COAL MBgRS  - :          A  national conference of delegates of the.Miners     Federation of Great Britain meets  in London to-day (Timrsday)     to consider the refusal of the  miners1  demands.   It  is probable     that the  Conference will  decide  to ballot  the members as  to     their willingness  to strike,  either for the original  claims     or for  a  higher increase  of wages,  in lieu of the  reduction in     the price of coal.   It  is not unlikely that the  miners1 leaders     think that  the  threat  of  a  national strike  will... lead  to a     resumption  of negotiations.  As far as  it  ie possible at  presen     to form an  estimate  of  the  ballot,  the two-thirds  majority     necessary for a  strike  seems likely  to  be  obtained, but a stroke                                                          could/
      could  soarcely  materialise in  less  than  four  weeks.           If  the miners  drop  the  demand  for a reduction  in  the      price  of coal,  they will forfeit  such sympathy as exists      for  them among  other  trade unionists.  If,  on the other hand,      tneir wages are increased, there  is already talk of similar      demands  from other  industries.          The  agitation  regarding stocks of coal has spread from      South Wales to  Scotland,  whore it is suggested thet the men      shall  adopt a working week of  three days, to prevent the      accumulation of stocks.   It will ho remembered that the      Scottish miners have already decided in  favour of a five day      working week by 70,801 to 27,820 votes.          Miners at  Bowhill, .J?ifeshire, have  decided to issue     promissory notes to the  value  of  1,500,  and for sums of      10s., 5s. and Is. in order to  tide over  distress in the event      of a strike.  It is said  that, local shopkeepers have agreed      to accept these notes.     tTHE EflQIBBBBIBG INDUSTRY          The decision of the  conference of engineering,  foundry     and shipbuilding trades  to recommend the  termination of the     agreement of 1917,  whereby wages were  reviewed every four     months by the Industrial  Court, is merely a preliminary to     more  active measures.   It, is anticipated  that the ballot will     take  three weeks to  complete and that  negotiations will then     be undertaken directly with the.employers.          My Lancashire  correspondent reports  that in  his district     the strike-feeling  is  spreading and adds  that&apos;a strike  in  the     near  future-is-considered a certainty.   In/ laflchester,  Bolton     and Oldham the  local officials, have  groat difficulty in     restraining the  men.  The ban on overtime has caused several     stoppages in  the cotton mills,  owing to the fact  that repairs     and overhauling  of machinery,which used to be done at night,     have  now  to be dons  during the  day.
           In the Coventry district the engineers are much     perturbed by growing unemployment; there are rumours that     the Austin Motor Co. Ltd., is on the verge of bankruptcy     and the fear of unemployment has a steadying effect.  In     Newcastle there is also a feeling that a strike would be     ill-timed as it is believed that the employers would welcome     a stoppage.           It,has been suggested that this would be an opportune     moment to push payment by results as many of the men would     be inclined to accept the system in defiance of their unions,LABQUB AND 3KB CO-OPSRATIVIS MOVISMlte          There are indications that negotiations are in progress     between co-operative societies and trade unions in various     parts of the country.   Quite apart from any national     arrangements,  such as  may bo made by the governing bodies,     it must be noted that  the local co-operative soaieties are     practically autonomous as regards the trading and credit     facilities given.   In  South Wales,  for instance,  where the     Miners1  Federation has already invested  175,711.  19s. 2d.,     or more than one-third of its total  funds in the  Co-operativ     Wholesale  Bank,  there  is known to be an understanding betwee     the  miners and the societies throughout the coalfield.   Othe     Welsh  Trade Unions intend to take up shares in order to     guarantee  their  food supply.   The Liverpool and Manchester     Soviets  have also  approached the local  co-operative societie     and  it is  stated that  arrangements are  being made  for food     supplies in the  event  of revolution.         The co-operative  societies  show signs  of making a     determined  stand against the  imposition of  income  tax and  a     refusal  to pay is not  impossible.         The Financial Propaganda  Department  of the Co-operativ                                                  Wholesale/
     Wholesale Society is making a great effort to obtain more     capital, the need for whioh is emphasised by John Penny in     the current issue of the &quot;Co-oporativo flows&quot;.  He writes:     &quot;We want capital in the movement.  We are not enemies of capital,     however bitter we may bo about capitalism.  Our object is to     obtain capital, and use it in the movement as a means of     destroying capitalism.&quot;   .          Unrest among co-operative employees,is still rife; this     fact is regarded by labour loaders as a calamity and a strike     as &quot;a thing that ought not to be possible&quot;.THE HOUSING (TJBSTlON          It is reported that the Scottish Union of Mine Workers     end the Scottish section of the Iron and Steel Trades     Confederation, have instructed their members to strike for 24     hours on August 23rd.  In spite of this important lead, however,     it is reported that several unions have not yet made any     recommendation as they are of opinion that the &quot;No rent&quot; crusade     should have  been initiated by the Trade Union movement and not by     an &quot;unofficial body&quot; such as the Scottish  Labour Housing     Association.          On August 8th several thousand people demonstrated against     the Rent Act on Glasgow Green.          One hundred and twelve delegates,  representing 75,400     organised workers,  chiefly miners .and co-operative societies,     from the Pontypridd,  Cardiff,  uerthyr and  Aberdare Valleys     districts, M8t at Pontypridd on August 2nd to discuss the Bent     Act..  The conference passed a resolution opposing the payment of     increased rent and demanded that steps  should be taken to organise     a  campaign to  bring  about  the  repeal of the  Act.   It was  also     decided  to press the South  Wales Miners&apos; Federation to convene a     coalfield conference to oonsider the whole situation with a  view                                                            to/
    to bringing about a general stoppage as a protest, and also    to ask the other industrial organisations to co-operate in    united action.with Scotland and other parts of the country.         On August 7bh some 50 delegates attended a meeting    convened by the Newcastle and district Trades and Labour    Council and appointed a committee to deal with the question    of increased rents.         There is apparently no abatement In the feeling against    dilution and the Walthamstow branch of the Operative Brick-    layers Society has passed a strong resolution against the    training of ex-Service men.         The recent quarterly meeting of the National federation    of Building Trade Operatives passed an important resolution    on strike policy.  Hitherto the Executive has not had the    power to call a strike without the consent of affiliated    societies who may have members involved and action has been in    consequence delayed.   The resolution asks affiliated societies    to allow the federation *  in case of necessity, to instruct all    the Workers involved to cease work, provided that the    Executives of affiliated  unions are duly notified.THE &quot;UNITED&quot; CQ-lvmUNIST PARTY         The question of parliamentary action, which caused the    breakdown of the &quot;Unity&quot;  negotiations,  bids fair to split the    latest Communist Party.  On the one hand the extremists are    opposed to parliamentary action and on  the other the saner    olements maintain that the Labour ?&amp;rty should not accept the    affiliation of the Communist Party.  In any case, Miss/Sylvia    Pankhurst has ruined the  prospects of her party and has laid    herself open to a cold reception in Russia.  As the recent    Congressjf the Third International in Moscow has decided in    favour of^parliamentary action,  Saklatvala is still of opinion                                                    s  that/
 that the two British Communist Parties should merge,  but  in the absence of very strong pressure  from Lenin,  this  course is unlikely.      Importance attaches to the recent Moscow meeting, at which McLaine,  Quelcfe,  Clarke,  Gallagher, Ramsay, Beech, Tanner,  Murphy and Margery Nwwbold are believed  to be present. It was there assumed that civil war  for revolutionary ends ia inevitable  and the principle laid down that the  Communist Party (in England or  elsewhere) &quot;must be built  on the  principle of strict centralisation,  and,  in  the period of  civil war, must introduce iron  military discipline into  its ranks.&quot;      MaoManus is hoping that money will be forthcoming from Russia to establish a new paper entitled  &quot;The Shop Steward&quot;, for the  publication of  which stfficient money has not yet been collected in  this  country.   It  is probable also  that Gallagher will bring  back money for &quot;The  Worker&quot;  for which he has already appealed to Russia.   It will be remembered that  for some time past Theodore Rothetein,  on behalf of Lenin, has been subsidising the  party organ of  the former British Socialist Party.      The danger  of  the British  Communist Party,  in the present time of grave unrest, lies not  in its numerical  strength, which is  small, but in its  avowed intention  &quot;to fan the already existing flames  of discontent,  to foment revolt and finally tobring about revolutionary action.  To every struggle of the masses   it will  seek  to give a  revolutionary purpose and meaning.&quot;The members of the party.are, for the most part,  shop stewardsand  are already alive to  the possibilities of causing trouble in  the Wavy and the Army.  In the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; (the new title of &quot;The Call&quot;) it is urged that &quot;Comrades who livenear the naval ports or have pals afloat should seize this opportunity (alleged unrest among the lower deck) for spreading                                                revolution: ry/
                                mm Q m     revolutionary propaganda and Soviet and Communist ideas     in the-Navy.&quot;          On August 8th Albert Ward, one of the Lancashire     Communist leaders, addressing a meeting of some 1,000 colliers     at Wigan, said in relation to the orisis in the mining     industry, &quot;It all depends on the soldiers and it is the duty     of everyone hero to carry on active propaganda not only     amongst the workers but inside the Army itself.&quot;          A disquieting feature of the present state of unrest     is the fact that the call for troops, in Ireland has left     England and Scotland here of serviceable troops in the event     of large disturbances, for it may be a little doubtful whether     the ordinary Irish battalions are to-be depended on for aid to     the oivil power.  This, however^ does not yet apppear to be     known to the extremists, and it is pretty certain that entire     reliance can bo placed upon the Brigade of Guards and, it is     believed, upon the Police force.THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL          The Geneva Congress of the Second International eat from     July 31st to August 5th under the presidency of IJr. Tom Shaw.     The outstanding feature of the Congress was the emphatic     repudiation of Bolshevism,  nr. Shaw is reported to have left     the President&apos;s chair to declare that &quot;There is no proletarian     dictatorship in Russia, no freedom, no democracy, only the     autocratic rule of a small group.   The workers have no liberty     They must work where directed and at what they are told.&quot;          It was decided, although delegates from Prance, Belgium     and Germany abstained from voting, to transfer the secretariat     to London.  The next Congress will he held in 3russels in 1922          The following were elected to the International Bxecutiv     Mir. Arthur Henderson,  U.P., (President),  M. Camille Huysraans                                                        (Secretary
      (Secretary), Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. (Treasurer) and Messrs.      Branting, R. Macdonald, Troelstra, Vandervelde and Wels.BZ-SSRVICS irSH          On August 7th delegates representing  the National      Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and      Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the National      Association of Ex-Service lien, the Officers&apos; Association and      the National Union of Ex-Service Men discussed proposals for      amalgamation.  A committee was appointed to draft a    &quot;constitution.  A. B. Mander of the National Union of Ex-      Service lien said that his organisation did not desire      amalgamation except on a basis of anti-militarism and the      common ownership of land and capital.   These stipulations      were declared by the chairman to be beyond the scope of the      meeting and.the representatives of the National Union of      Bx-Servioe Men abstained from voting.   It is said that Mander      has plenty of money since he returned from the International      conference.M-INSPECTOR JOBfl SYICB          On August 6th John Syme again sought publicity for his      grievances by breaking a window at 10, Downing Street.  He was      arrested and charged at Bow Street, where he read a long letter     which he said he had recently addressed to the Prime Minister.      Re was fined  5 and ordered to pay  1. 10. 0. damages, or      sentenced to 11 days1  imprisonment.  He refused to pay the fine.SINN FEIN IN GEgAT BRITAIN          Interest in Irish matters has been eclipsed by the     excitement over the Polish question,although the expected     arrival of Dr.  Miannix aroused considerable excitement in     Liverpool.  An Irish deputation, including the Lord Mayor of.                                                    Dublin/
Dublin, Count Plunkott, Alderman Byrne, Councillors0&apos;Loughlin and Paul, Mrs. Wyse Power and Mrs. M&apos; Garry, visitedthat oity to reoeive him, and was given an enthusiastic send-off when it returned to Ireland on August 9th.  Some 4,000people attended a demonstration earlier  on that day, Wfcenprotewts wore made against the refusal to allow Dr4 Mannix toland at Liverpool.     When Dr, Mannix was seen by a Police,Inspector on board the &quot;Baltic&quot; and served with an order excluding him fromLiverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, he accepted the situationafter a protest.  He is now said to be taking legal advice       *on the aotion of the authorities in excluding him from Ireland     On August 8th four men were arrested in the course ofdisturbances at a,Sinn Pein meeting at Tyldesley, when attemptwere made to seize a Union Jack displayed by a member of theaudience.  Three of the men arrested were fined and the otherremanded.  Colliers present assisted the police.     A branch of the Irish Self Determination League has recenbeen formed at Rochdale with about 250 members.     On August 3rd, Sean Milroy, Sean 0&apos;Mahoney, M.P.&apos;, and SeHayes, M.P., were the principal speakers at a Middlesbroughmeeting.  The ,-first named tauiited the Trade Union leaders withthe Congress resolution and accused them of &quot;clumsy camouflage,.     Sinn Peinmeetings in South Wales have been sparselyattended during the week, owing probably to the holidays.     It is reported that ,T. Holan Welshe, Glasgow, Secretaryof the local Irish Party, has reoeived a communication fromCouncillor Ryan, of Gateskead-on-Tyne, intimating that theExecutive had decided,  in view of the rapidly approaching Iris))crisis to call a conference of delegates of all the branches ofthe organisation in ^England and Scotland;, to be held on the                                                . Tyneside/
     Tyneside on August 23rd.  James Roe has been appointed     delegate for Glasgow.          My Glasgow correspondent reports that a number of     local extremistss, including v/allace, Slavin and Kane,     visited Ireland during the week and adds that McGovern,     John Bell and MacManus are expected to join them.   It  is     believed that the visit is connected with Communist     propaganda.          Captain White addressed John McLean1s meetings in     Glasgow on August 8th and was well received.   A large     collection was taken for the Irish railwayroenTs strike     fund.          The &quot;Hands off Ireland&quot; meeting in Trafalgar  Square     on Sunday was attended by about 600 people.   The speeches     were violent and irresponsible, but evoked enthusiasm  from     a section of the audience only.  Money thrown on the     plinth amounted to about  8.IRELAND          There is abundant evidence that the Sinn Pein leaders     are very uneasy.   In the various outrages  their losses     appear to have been heavier than we know;  the quarrel     between de Valera and the Clan-na-Gael has been disturbing     and the Bolshevik tinge which is growing among their     followers has alarmed them;  and now comes  the publication     of the minutes of the Sinn Pein Cabinet,  showing&apos;that     money was to be spent by de. Valera&apos;In corruption during  the     Presidential Election.   This is causing an enormous .    . sensation, in America and it is reported that  the Senate  is     to open an  enquiry.          There  is very little change  in the situation.   No     police barraoks were attacked and it would seem that these                                                     attacks/
*- ISattacks are too costly and are being abandoned in favour of attacks on patrols.  The number of outrages reported is &apos;approximately 243 as against 287 last week.  Of these only 7were due to agrarian motives, 30 were serious offencesattributable to the disordered state of the country, and 206were directly due to Sinn Fein.     The most serious event of the week occurred at Eildorrery,Co. Cork, on the morning of August 7th, when a patrol of 6police ran into an ambush of about 80 men who opened fire on them with rifles, shot-guns and revolvers.  All the policewere wounded; one died almost immediately and another is in a precarious condition.     A polios patrol near Rooheford Bridge, Co. Westmeath,was ambushed by a party of Sinn Feiners on Augus^Srd, and oneconstable was seriously wounded.  Six of the attacking partyhave been arrested and identified.     Mail trains and cars are held up and robbed almost daily.     Sinn Fein is still concentrating on attempts to break upthe Royal Irish Constabulary.  A Sinn Fein circular has now appeared directing members of clubs to call on the parentsof men serving in the Force end warn them to try to get theirsons to resign, in which ease Sinn Fein will get them work or pay their passage to America.  Police who resign are to ketreated in a friendly manner.     The railway trouble is causing Sinn Fein some anxiety.The number of men now dismissed is very considerable and theyare grumbling.  Subscriptions are coming in slowly and Sinn Feinappears to find difficulty in paying them even the small doleit allows in lieu of wages.  This fact is likely to cause aserious split.  Several more railwaymen were kidnapped duringthe week for refusing to cease work.  Farmers are also becomingannoyed by the increasing insecurity of their holdings and bythe number of bogus claims made on them.                                                 Elements/
     Elements of disruption are Bald to  be  at work amongSinn Pelnors; there is discontent with de Valara  and ArthurGriffith is believed to be under suspicion.     &quot;Old Ireland&quot;, &quot;New Ireland&quot; and the  &quot;Watchword ofLabour&quot; were again published.
