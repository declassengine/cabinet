.............1     -  &apos;&quot;L;          &apos; This Document is the Property^&quot;                                    His kkViiiivv-; iVuuestys Government.       MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD  -&quot;O^-H^j^i                  &quot;    rjj It    As my department has been engaged on an estimate as to food prices during the coming winter,  I think it desirable that the conclusions arrived at should be  stated briefly for the information of the Cabinet.-      The estimate in question assumes the Pood Budget used by the Statistical Department of the Ministry of -Labour and takes into account the changes due to seasonal and other causes, including the effect of the, restriction of  the subsidy on the price of Bread and Flour,  On this basis a food index number comparable with that published every month by the Ministry of Labour is determined. 2.    The Pood Index number for August 1st. 1920 is 26.2 and that for November 1st, - 1919 was 251.   It is estimated that by November 1st 1920 it will have risen to 287,  the difference between the. two  Novembers amounting thus to no less than 56 points. As an estimate of this kind is only provisional it is better to state the probable Pood Index number for November 1st.  1920 as between 285 and  290. 3t   Of the 56 points,  or there abouts,  of  difference thus  shown, 45  are calculated as  due to  increases In the  prices of Bread and Flour,  and of  Sugar*   Of the remainder,  between 7 and  8 are attributable to  the rise  in Butter,  leaving 3  or 4 points  as due on balance to  minor rises  in &apos;other food prices  after  deducting &apos; minor falls in certain others.     Slight increases are  anticipated in  Home Meat,  Bacon,  Milk, Margarine/ Cheese and  Eggs  and slight  falls in Imported Meat, Tea,  Potatoes  and Fish. 4.    As  already  stated  the  comparison  is  between  the November  of 1919  and  the November  of  1920,  and it  should be noted that  the Index Number is  that for  Food only and not     the  general  index number which includes data  as to clothing,  fuel, etc.                              CHARLES.
