&quot;fiprT               This Document is  the  Propor&amp;of.              From&apos;Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,                                 29th July 1920.           the line.         708.  Your telegram dated the 24th July, 923 S.   Terms  of proposed  letter    mir are approved generally, but  seem to imply a little too much eagerness on our side.   I suggest following alterations: For &quot;neighbourly,&quot; read &quot;neighbouring.&quot;Afterwords &quot;you desire to  conclude a treaty of&apos; friendship,&quot; substitute for rest  of sentence &quot; and if attitude of  your Government  and officials is clearly consistent withthat desire, there will, be no obstacle on the part of my Government to negotiatingsuch a treaty.&quot;     I should have been glad to have opportunity  of considering written statement ofbasis of treaty of friendship before it is  communicated  to  Afghans.  I assume thatstipulations to be  required  of  Afghan  Government are those  referred to in  yourtelegram dated the 19th June, 751) S., and my telegram elated the 24th June, and thatgifts and concessions, in addition, to subsidy, are the small gifts and the general promise of assistance referred to in your telegram dated the 3rd July, 812 S., and my telegram dated the 6th July.  On this assumption you are authorised to proceed as proposed if. you consider, immediate communication of statement to Afghans necessary. But please inany case telegraph at once terms of statement.  I  hope you will  consider whether any-thing  can  be said or done to  prevent a treaty and subsidy being obtained at  the sametime for the Bolsheviks. Situation would be both absurd and indefensible if Afghanistanwere.to  conclude  similar treaties with  both parties.   Relations  of some sort withBolsheviks if they remain  in  control of neighbouring territories will probably be inevitable. , But not even the geographical position or the, temptations of Afghanistancould justify her being simultaneously subsidised on both sides.
