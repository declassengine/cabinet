Telegrams relating to Mesopotamian Situation.79 6               From Secretary of State to Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,                               &apos;  2nd August 1920.  &apos;       Clear the line.       Mesopotamian situation.  I should be glad to have from you a fuller appreciation  of the causes and objective of the rising,  is it organised, as suggested in your police-  reports  dated 5th and 12th June, by extremist element in Baghdad, or is it clue to  local causes, agrarian or other ?  Until the promoters of the rebellion and their objects  are known, it is impossible to suggest a remedy.               From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, bih August 1920.     (R.)  9450.  Your  telegram  dated  2nd  August.  Causes  of  present  risingMy telegrams  for last  18 months  have recorded  steady inflow  of propaganda fromSyria and to a less degree from Turkey, supported by ample funds.   See particularlymy telegram dated 15th May, No. 5803.  So long  as our military weakness was notapparent, this  propaganda,  the  objects  of which were largely  foreign to ideas  of people at large, had little success, except in  Baghdad, Kerbela and Najaf, wheresentimental leaders have always  been more or less in sympathy with idea  of pureIslamic state, vide my telegram of 26th January 1919, No. 1076.     It was not, however,  until our enemies  in Syria demonstrated to  people  ofMesopotamia that  we could  be  dislodged  by  (corrupt grouping up  that movementbecame  dangerous.  We successively evacuated  Uair-az-Zor  and Albu  Kamal andAlquim,  oh each occasion under pressure  from Syrian Government.     Trains were  derailed  between  Baghdad and  Mosul,  and our officers  weremurdered  at Tel Afar.  Public  confidence in our ability to maintain order began  towane.  Extremists  began to hope that  they might  be  successful in attaining their object,  viz.,  complete  independence and. freedom from all  foreign interference, by direct action.   Kerbela  and Najaf became principal centres of agitation.   (It wall beremembered that I had to deport a number of men from Kerbela in September 1919to prevent a rising, and Najaf wras  scene of disturbance in 1918.)     The arrest of  Mirza Mohammed Riza  and others  at Kerbela  in  June, and ofcertain minor  personages at Hillah, stabilised the situation  in  Hillah division, but,4 owing to our military weakness, we were unable  to  take similar action in Shamiyahdivision,, where wre only had some 300 men and two guns.     This division,  which has always  borne a bad  reputation,  vide AdministrationReport for 1918, became focus of intrigues.     Meanwhile, the announcement of terms of peace with Turkey had, as anticipated,an unfavourable effect  on public  opinion, and it enabled extremists  to rally to theircause much useful  material in  the form  of ex-Turkish officials and  (corrupt group)large body of public opinion, wrho  wished for maintenance  of Turkish  Empire, andresented, acquisitions of Greece.   Coming as  it  did at beginning of Ramazan, andsynchronizing with our  evacuation of Enzeli  and Resht, and  reports  of Bolsheviksuccesses in other  parts of the world, it gave extremists an opportunity, of  whichthey were not slow immediately  to avail themselves, to represent  us  on  the onehand as pursuing  an anti-Islamic policy, and  on the other hand as rapidly  growingweaker.     At  this  point  other foreign  influences  commenced  to  make  themselves felt,notably  United States  Consul  and -other United States citizens who, I have  every reason to know, make it their business to convev to extremists in detail  all references in English Press unfavourable to Local and Imperial policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, .notably articles  from the Times which are freely referred to by extremists intheir public speeches and conversations.  In this connection  we know that 7,000Z. in turkish gold reached extremists in Kerbela during May and June.     Certain  Shamiyah  Chiefs, whom we  were, as already explained, unable to  arrest,directed their energies  to cause a rising in Samawah Rumaitha  area, realising easily      IO  2118-2   100  8.20               A
that this is the most  vulnerable point in our communications in Mesopotamia.  this area  has never been penetrated  by our troops  and is in fact impenetrable;  for  thepast  year  it  has  been in an  unsatisfactory state, see my Despatch dated 20th July,No. 21256, reporting events leading up to recent  punitive expedition there.    The outbreak occurred at Rumaitha on  3rd  June;  had we been able to despatchtroops in adequate numbers promptly to the  rising, it would not, I think, have spread,and  situation in  Shamiyah, where no  rising took, place  for another 15 days, wouldhave been dealt with (? by) diplomatic means.  But we were not in a position,  to doso, and the rising slowly spread in consequence.    Objectives of  present rising. The tribes have been led to believe that it is a holywar, and  Chief Mujtahid of Kerbela  is actively  preaching  a  Jihad,  and has senthundreds of emissaries all over middle Euphrates  districts in this connection.   The&apos;chiefs of tribes in Hillah and Diwaniyah divisions have mostly followed their tribes-men rather than led  them.    The demands of rebellious leaders so far (? formulated) are complete  expulsionof British from Mesopotamia, and an &quot;Islamic Kingdom.&quot; . To Shamiyah this means the theocratic state which is  their ideal; to tribes it means no Government at all, or government by chiefs whom they can ignore at  will;  to a small minority of towns-people it connotes an Amir.    I clo  not think rebels  have  any  agrarian  grievances ;  taxation  is light and(?harvest) good ;&apos;were there any such grievances, area of disturbance would not belimited  as  now to Shia districts within reach of  Najaf and Kerbela.   Tribes  clo not.of course, like paying taxes any more than other  people, but this would not of itselfhave been cause of rising had we not been weak, and had  not,external  causes  above referred to existed.               From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 12th August 1920.                               (Copy posted India.)    9700.  Our telegram of 5th August,  9450, dealt with more  immediate cause and objectives of the present rising on the middle Euphrates, the most important factor in(? which was)  propaganda  from Baghdad.   I  did not  deal with  reasons underlying-loss by the civil administration of that degree of popularity which it first enjoyed.    1. In the light  of our experience of past three months,  I think  that  we mustplead guilty of  going  too  fast in  various administrative  matters affecting  tribes of(corrupt group).  The blame  for this  must be  distributed  about  equally  betweenadministration and the Sheikhs and other (? tribal) leaders.    We have  as  a  matterof policy backed the Sheikhs (?  and)  supported  their  authority.   They  in their turn have tried to (&apos;? word omitted) too great a  burden  on   their  tribesmen  withthe  laudable  intention  of improving  cultivation and  ensuring  good  crops,  by.extensive work  on clearing (? canals)  and  making  bunds, and incidentally  havelined their own C? pockets) -? very) substantially.   The Sheikhs  have discoveredtoo late  (? that they) did not possess influence  that they  were supposed to have over their tribesmen, and  are suffering accordingly.     2;. Another factor of  (? no little  consequence) peculiar  to  Mesopotamia  whichhas tended to cause discontent is the  gradual appearance  in  Mesopotamia of what may be called post-war conditions.  High  prices, shortage  of certain,  necessaries,&amp;c, (three corrupt  groups) in the case of  certain (?  classes)  of  the population  bythe wealth which is  tasted by  the country by Army of Occupation, but large classesfeel pinch, and we, as the victors in the world war, have in Mesopotamia as elsewhereto bear odium of having brought these conditions about.     3.  But perhaps  first in order of (corrupt group) importance comes perception ofour military weakness.  To kick a. man when  he  is down is the most popular pastimein the East sanctioned by centuries of precept and practice.     4,  Adverse influence  of Shiahs Mujtahids, who have been against all government since the (? days of)  Caliph.     5.  President A&apos;wilson&apos;s 14 points and agitation created thereby and stimulated bySheriffian,&quot; Turkish and (corrupt group) agencies both voluntary and. paid.     6.  Difference of race  and religion between British and Native Civil Service usedmore as an excuse than as a cause itself.     7.  Delay in defining status of  Mesopotamia and in consequence maintenance of(corrupt  group) British administration long after the Armistice.   If  my recollection
serves (? me)  right, as recently as  October 1918-19  (sic)  (? I was)  warned against taking any action or making any announcement  such  as would give the impression that we had been given or would accept mandate  for Mesopotamia.     8. The influence  of Syria, where liberal  British  subsidy enabled SherriffianGovernment to pay to its officials, particularly in  the Army,  emoluments far in excess ,of those which this  or  any other administration, organised on a self-supporting basis,could afford.     9. (Corrupt group) for labour on flooding banks.   The Arabs would rather risk aflood, an act of God, then do heavy work on flooding banks, the work of the English(corrupt group) (? which the) circumstances  of military  occupation have been partly responsible for.  We have throughout  been, and indeed still  are, subjected to  con-siderable legitimate pressure from the military authorities to maintain bunds in sucha state of efficiency  (? as will) preclude any risk of railways being cut or cantonment(? areas) of being flooded.   It was on this condition (? that the) Irrigation department was taken over (? by the) Civil Administration.     .10. Collection of land revenue and other taxes.     11. Fear of exploiting (corrupt group) by Western  commercialism.     12. Use of aeroplane against recalcitrants.     13. Disappointment of  (? landed interests), who reject  the idea that  landlordshave duties as well as rights, and resent  as &quot; illegal&quot; any  attempt  to withhold fullmeasure of their pound of flesh from cultivator, who in  their  turn resent  any attemptson the part of  Government  to use forces  of law and. order for recovery of dues onbehalf of  landlords.   Complexity  of Turkish law on  this  subject often makes theposition of Political Officers exceedingly difficult.     14. It is held  by many here, both  British and  native, that I made a mistake  in not dealing with prominent agitators here drastically before the movement had reached its present dimensions.  This, however, is  a matter  of  opinion (corrupt  group).  an administration of this sort at such a  juncture must necessarily have  great difficultyin deciding at what point a constitutional movement becomes so seditious  as to demandor justify repression.  Impracticable as are  their aims,  they have for the most  partendorsed at one time or another  in official pronouncement (? valuable  services of)His Majesty&apos;s Government, and having regard to wording of  Article 22 of the Leagueof Nations  I doubt whether we should have been  justified in arresting those who nowdeclare themselves to be unwilling to accept  a  British (? Mandate) so  long as theirattitude did not (? endanger) public order.                From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 12th. August 1920.     9703.   The following proclamation has  been issued  by Brig.-Gen. Sanders,General Officer  Commanding  Baghdad Defences, in the name of the General OfficerOommanding-in-Chief, to the people of Baghdad :      &quot; Ever since Ramadihan, certain,  evilly disposed persons have  been in the habit of summoning mauluds every Friday night ostensibly  for  religious  purposes,  butreally in order to inflame the mind of the public against  the Government and to  stirup disorder. -  In order to avoid giving ground for the belief that it wished to suppressfree  public discussion, the occupying authority has hitherto refrained from interferingin this matter, but as it now appears that the freedom allowed  has been  abused, andthat  the ignorant are led astray by the audacity of the agitators who make speeches atthe mauluds, it is hereby notified that the holding of mauluds is forbidden, and&apos; thatthe holding of meetings for  political  purposes otherwise  than in accordance with  theTurkish law on the  subject, and with the permission  of the Military Governor andPolitical  Officer,  Baghdad, will  be punished with  the utmost severity.  A militarycourt has been established to try all offences against public  order.&quot;              From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, loth August 1920.   (Repeated to Foreign Office, Simla, Teheran, Constantinople, Cairo, (corrupt group).     Clear the line.     9751.   Situation has (? developed) unfavourably during past 48  hours.  attempt was made on llth to ambush Assistant Political Officer, Telafar (? who was) parleying     - 2118-2                            A 2 .
 -with Shammar supported  by  three  squadrons  of  cavalry.   Appears  to  me  that tribesmen treacherous, opened  lire on cavalry escort, who  returned  five with good results.     Secondly, attempt was made on 12th to (? ambush) Political Officer, Arbil, on his way to (? Rowanduz) to meet Seyyicl  Tahar.  Political Officer was accompanied&apos; by- Levy Officer and got away with assistance of  tribal escort, but  he  considers attempt was probably first move in preconcerted  revolutionary scheme, owing to  (? stubborn) spirit of disorder among tribes.     Thirdly, it is reported that  Lieut.-Col. Leachman was (sic) assassinated and killed 12th August near Follujah.     Fourthly, it has  become necessary to withdraw Assistant  Political Officer from Qalatsikar.  As a  result of this  step it  is,  I  fear, inevitable  that Assistant Political Officers at Hai and Shatrah will also be forced to leave, and  this  in  turn will react unfavourably on situation both on Tigris and Euphrates,     Fifthly, at present time there is (? no) sign of disturbances in  Sulaimaniyah Division itself, but the country on Persian  side of frontier is greatly disturbed,  and it is not improbable that it will spread across  border  as soon as it is realised that we are unable to detach forces in this direction.     Sixthly.   Situation at Samawah also threatening.     Seventhly.  Political  Officer,  Baqubah,  has  been  compelled  to evacuate  that place as a result of tribal, rising, which (? column) was not successful in  suppressing, and it must be assumed that Shahraban and Khani (?--)n will shortly  follow suit, as  there are no troops there and our communications with Persia are thus severed.     Eighthly.  General  Officer  Commanding-in-Chief  is   doubtless  addressing War Office military  aspect.  I  need only say  that  I  think we  must  now  (? act) on  assumption that disorder wall (? shortly) become general, and we must be prepared for further withdrawals.   (Corrupt  group) once civil administration has been thus compelled precipitately to evacuate a district, it will be difficult, if not  impossible, to restore  it except by  military operations  in  the district  affected,  and  there  is  no- immediate prospect  (? of  this),  and  as civil revenue cannot  afford to maintain employees for any length of time who are not doing productive work, I am commencing to  send back to India  considerable numbers of  employees on  civil  departmental (? duty), particularly irrigation works post  and (? telegraphs).               From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, - August 1920.    (R.)  9752.  My telegram  of   1.2th  August, No.  9703,  Simultaneously with-issue of this  proclamation  I gave orders, with the approval of the General  OfficerCommanding-iiirChief, for arrest of  Yusuf Suwaide,  Jafar Abu Timmin, Ali Baziganand Sheikh Ahmad  Daud.  Owing to extreme difficulty  of  effecting these  arrestsin middle of crowded (? quarter) (corrupt group) of the local police, it was necessary totake steps at very short notice under very difficult circumstances, and police w^ereonly successful  in  arresting No. 4, who  will be sent to  lienjam.  Attempts  arebeing made  to trace the first three, but I have  little hope that they will be appre-hendecl.   They have probably already left  Baghdad for Eadhimain,  or to join  the tribes wdio are (corrupt  group) hostile north-east and west of Baghdad.  Furtherarrests will be made  ol other leading, agitators ; search of houses of above-mentionedpersons lias produced some interesting  documents, and a bomb was found ready foruse at  short notice  in  desk (corrupt  group).   No. 3, who  was headmaster  in&quot; Nationalist &quot; school for boys.   (? There) was a certain amount of  hostility shown by-men in (? houses) near  first named, and police  were heavily fired on,  who repliedeffectively, killing several and arresting others, who will be tried by military court.    Momentary effect produced  has been excellent, the stalwart  attitude  of Arabpolice  in  Baghdad,  and of Arab levies in Hilla  and (? other parts), and steadinessof most Arab officials of Civil Administration, particularly in Education  Department,.is an encouraging feature of the situation.
                 From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 17th August 1920.           (Repeated Simla, Tehran, Constantinople, Cairo and Jerusalem.)     Clear the line.     (R.)   Skoal.  My telegram of 13th August (? 975 1).  I regret  to have to report further unfavourable developments.   Refugees&apos; camp at Baqubah has been attacked. Baqubah. itself has been sacked by riff-raff of town assisted by (? tribesmen) (? full stop) Shahrabau and Qizil  Esbat has (sic) been sacked and ,a Political Officer and officer captured or killed.   At Kaniqin Government offices and house of a Political Officer has (sic) been burnt, and a Political Officer with his wife and family have been forced to  take refuge at railhead.  A Political  Officer at Diitawah is in his house, but no longer in authority.   Our detachments at Qarsa and at Quragha (the latter being the junction of Kifri line  with the main line  from Baghdad to.the  (? Persian) frontier are surrounded, and various bridges have been, burnt.   Our  (? detachments) at  (? Kifri) and (? Kirkuk) are  thus (? cut) off, and it (? will&apos;not  be) possible to (corrupt group) extricate (? them) for some considerable time to  come.   Our detachments at Ramadi and Fallujah are cut off from Baghdad.   Situation  is obscure owing to absence of telegraph(? ic) communication by land wire or wireless, but there is little (? doubt) that division is  in an uproar.  (? The)  evacuation  of  Mosul Vilayet  may, in my opinion, shortly  be forced  upon  us.   Withdrawal of  force  from that  place is a  most difficult  operation, but  it may not  be  impossible  of  accomplishment without  serious  (? losses) if  sufficient  forces  can  be  (? made)  (corrupt  group) capable  of protecting (?&apos; the line) from Baghdad  to  Shargat,  either  from  fresh troops now arriving or by  withdrawals  from Ramadi and possibly Kirkuk.   If we (? withdraw from) Kirkuk the whole of Kurdistan will of course relapse into anarchy. Revolutionary movement has  for some time  past ceased to have any political aspect and has become entirely. (? anarchic;.  No One appears more anxious (to) than  leading Mujtahicls  and  many of  the  leading people  of  (? Baghdad) to  put an  end  to disturbances which they themselves have created, but it is not within their  power to do  so.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are in a better  position than  we  on  the spot to judge the political effect  of movements indicated above on British interests (? in the) Middle East (&apos;?  full stop)  I can (? only) repeat  that (? whether we) are to  go or to stay, more troops  are  required (? than&apos; those now)  in country or on their  way. (? That being so) would (? urge) whatever can be done to despatch troops be done-(? forthwith),.that we this  month told what is the  most  His  Majesty&apos;s Government can clo for  us, and  that General Officer Commanding-in-Chief be given authority to frame his plans including withdrawal of all troops from Persia, accordingly.    Eastern Committee are  presumably aware that a  division now arriving  from India contains no British battalions, and you aware from my previous telegrams that we  are  relying more than is  either right or expedient upon&apos; Indian battalions  to maintain (? these) I am shipping down-stream all women and children belonging to Officer Commanding (? omission)s of Civil Administration as soon as possible (corrupt group) intimate that am repatriating certain departmental personnel (? full stop).    Foregoing telegram has been seen by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief .who , has no comments to make.               From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad^ 19th August 1920.    Clear the line.    9990.  Our telegram of the  16th August,  9889.  All  (? British) women andchildren  (? leave)  Kirkuk  to-day,  and arrangements  have  been completed  for evacuation when the time comes of Arbil, Sulaimani, and Kirkuk by (? group omitted)and civil.   We  have evacuated by  (sic)-Ana,  and shall probably  have to leave  Hitshortly.  All  civil officers at Sharaban were murdered.
