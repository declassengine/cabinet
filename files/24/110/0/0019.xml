This  document  is the  property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET.THE  CABINET.PERSIA AND MESOPOTAMIA.     The following telegrams are circulated by the Secretary of State for War :           From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.                                              Despatched 30th July, 1920,  0410.(No. X 9632, cipher.)                                      (Received 31st, 0800.)     First of two parts.  Reference Britmilafs, Teheraifs, No. C. 36, 28th July, to you,and  Minister,  Teherans,  iNos.  247  and 541, both  28th July,  to  Foreign Office.Following is summary of telegrams from Norperforce just received :      He  considers he  may  have to withdraw from Menjil area to Kasvin owing todanger of enveloping  movement of hostile forces  which appear to be more than mereJangeli  irregulars  and  have (one group  undecipherable)  of 4&apos;5-inch  howitzers  andmountain guns.   General Champain will  find road difficult to keep open  with forceavailable (?) and he proposes to carry out the withdrawal.  He further considers thathe  will  be so weak on withdrawal  of  two  British battalions  (see my telegramNo. X 9397, 12th July)  as to necessitate  retirement to Hamadan with whole force atthe same time.  He asks permission to tell Minister that he proposes to (? withdraw).     Second and last part.   I am not in a position to give any assistance to troops in north-West Persia nor  to order General Champain to hold on at Menjil or Kasvin ifhe finds  his  position  untenable.  Unless  reinforcements  considerably (?)  exceeding a division come to Mesopotamia I could  give  him  no assistance,  and even then, with transport situation, should probably be unable to support many more troops in Persia.It would take nearly 2 months for troops to reach Kasvin from Basra.             From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office.                                              Despatched 30th July, 1920, 1605.(No. X 9623, cipher.)                                      (Received 31st. 0800).     First of four parts.  Your No.  85710,  M.O. 2, of 23rd  July being mutilated,repetition had  to be called for.   Have received to-day your No.  85772, M.O.  2, of29th July, giving sense of a previous telegram.     :.. Situation here has changed materially since 18th July.   Rebellion has spreadalmost to Baghdad, where my  position is  by no&apos;means  secure.   My whole disposableforce is at Hillah and beyond.  It is not likely that Sbatt-Al-Hai area will remain  quietfor more than  a  few days longer.  During  last few days  over 150 ex-Turkish  Arabofficers have joined tribes to organize them.   Part 2 follows :     (? Mir)za Mohamed Taqi  has ordered  tribes to fight against Government anddestroy railway and communications.  This means further spread of rebellion  amongShiah tribe.     3. I telegraphed on 26th July1 that it might be necessary to ask for  a  second division.   First battalion from India expected to sail to-day  and  cannot be available foruse before about 7 th  August.   Two following battalions not  till  5 days  later.  As yet no intimation of sailing of fourth battalion.    4. Strongly urge that with the least possible delay full division be despatched andthat preparations  be made for second.  Part 3 follows :     5. The strong rumour current last month of reinforcements on the way  has  beenpreventing more rapid spread of rebellion and those in our favour are counting on them.If reinforcements now fail the result will probably be a more violent reaction.  I  have    (B20/347) 70  8/20 HAS, Ltd 8446wo
(?) married families in the country and I cannot begin to evacuate them before October.Part 4 and last part:      6. Civil Commissioner  wholly  concurs, and expresses  opinion that whether it bedecided to remain in country or not a  division is  now necessary.  His  hopes that itmight be possible to dispense with additional formations, expressed to India Office bothofficially and privately, were based on anticipations of early success  on the Euphrateswhich have not been realized.     Repeated to India.              From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office.(No. X 9636, cipher.)                           Despatched 31st July, 1920, 1630.                                                           (Received 31st, 2140.)     Please see Civil Commissioners No. 9249 of 31st July to India Office.     I concur entirely in his views therein  expressed and cannot urge them too strongly.The situation requires some drastic diplomatic action such as suggested.  It is essential(? we should have)  the  goodwill  of  the  Arab population  to maintain pur hold onMesopotamia,  qn which entirely depends anything we can do (? for.it).  To safeguardsome 2,600 miles of communications by rail transport, river and road necessitates eithersecuring this goodwill or the presence of a force running into many thousands.
