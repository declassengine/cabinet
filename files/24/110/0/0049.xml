E. S. M    4th August 1920.                From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 21st July 1920.    8784.  Recent references in Parliament or elsewhere to Mesopotamia  lead me tothink that some statements as to practical efficiency of our revenue policy  during past five years should be made.  Question of incidence of taxation is  discussed at length in Land Revenue  Administration  Report for  1919 now in Press.   Chief points of comparison with Turks are as follows :     &apos; (1) Following major taxes  collected by  Turks  have  been  discontinued, viz.,           property  tax (vergu), profession tax  (tamattu), tent tax, military service           commutation tax.   No fresh  taxes imposed.    (2) As regards land revenue Turkish standards of yield per unit of measurement           have not  been  exacted  where found  excessive,  and proportion  of crop           claimed by Government everywhere reduced, generally by from  12 to 25           per cent, as  compared with share claimed by Turks.    ^3) Efficiency of collection undoubtedly  greater  than  under  Turks,   but  this           scarcely  seems fair  ground  for  attack.  If local  administration  had           connived  at local revenue payers&apos;  attempts  to  defraud  taxgatherer           enhanced burden would have fallen on British taxpayer  who would have           had to make up  deficit.  It must  also be remembered that  efficiency in           collection includes, and is inseparable from, more  equable distribution of           burden.     (4) Demand as formulated everywhere  collected practically in full and without           undue delay or difficulty.  Those who know the Arab will realise  that this *           fact alone suffices to discredit charge of over-taxation.     (5) All calamities, reported and proved, generously recognised by reduction demand           or remission ;  this was impossible under Turkish system.     (? 6) Sum  collected  under various heads  land  revenue  indubitably  larger           in certain areas than  recent Turkish times.  This can be  justified on           grounds   of  extension  and  improvement  of  irrigation,  consequence           expansion of agriculture and enormous rise in prices agricultural produce           from 2 to 500 per cent, in different centres.     (7) Benefits acknowledged in return by people themselves include besides those           above mentioned,  cessation  tribal   lighting,  discontinuance  expense of           upkeep of tribal forces, security of movement by road and river for goods..           and passengers and elimination of corruption from upper  grades  of public           services.        v                  &apos;     (8) Actual burden  land revenue falls not on cultivators but on shaikhs, sirkals,           and  tapuholcler (i:e.,  landlord).   These  three classes  admittedly  richer           since British occupation.     (9) Outbreak began in two  districts which  in  1919 and previous years got off           very lightly.  With  one partial exception it has since been confined to           districts  of which same is true.  This year demand not presented.  Other           districts  which may be affected also escaped lightly last year.  These areas .           in Turkish  times  latterly quite out of control and paid  practically no           revenue.   They have never seen British armies and. were never subdued.           Their attitude  where outbreak has occurred is not protest against over&apos;,&apos;           taxation but rather revolt against settled government of any kind inspired           by malicious propaganda, and especially by widely-circulated, rumour of           immediate departure of British.   I will deal in a separate  telegram           shortly with other aspects of question.io  2035    100 8.20
               From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 24th July 1020.    8934.  My telegram of 21st July, 878-1.  I submit following further  observations on financial aspects :      (1) Large increase in receipts during present and  last financial year no doubt           wrongly attributed to rapid .growth of taxation  whereas really due largely           to payments for augmented services rendered by Civil Administration to           other departments, chiefly the Army.    (2) Customs duty is levied at  11 per cent, now as before the war.  Land revenue           and  taxes  and  agricultural  produce  which constitute  practically only           direct taxation, and  which alone affect vast  mass of population total for           three years ending March 1921, 217, 198, and 21.6 lakhs.   1918 was year           in which  agriculture was  specially stimulated for military purposes, and           increase in 1920 is due  entirely to increased acreage from new canals,           &amp;c.    (3) Estimates of receipts during current year (vide Appendix 1 to my Despatch           14th  June) comprise only  following amounts payable by inhabitants of           occupied  territories all  in  lakhs  of  rupees.   Firstly,  direct  taxing           (items 1-5 on receipts  side) 216 ; secondly, customs 100, i.e., 40 per cent.           of total, balance falling chiefly  on Persian consumer; thirdly,  miscel-           laneous charges, e.g., judicial fees 7,  fines 2, municipal contributions 4-g-;           fourthly, payments for  services, viz., education fees -g, medical 1, posts 10,           telegraphs 6.  Total 347.   Corresponding amount in two periods previous           years 308 and 250.    (4) Out of total receipts therefore for current year,  amounting to 547 (excluding           payments for 1918-19  grain)  local inhabitants  contribute  about three-           fifths the remainder falling as to about 30 per cent, on Persian consumer           and about 70 per cent,  on departments,  mainly military.    (5) Of total expenditure of 734 lakhs following  items may be  described  as of           direct benefit to local taxpayer : 4 irrigation (excluding overhead charges),           50 agriculture, 7 judicial, 13  education,  17 medical, 50 post, 10 (equivalent           of payments  by public), telegraphs, 6 charitable  and religious objects,           21 public  works,  25 (consisting chiefly of roads, schools, and medical           buildings) and, say,  half cost of police and levies,  or 58 ;  total 261 out of           a gross expenditure of  734.  Public contribution towards balance  of 473,           representing general cost of administration, thus only 86.   For explanation           of high cost of administration see  my Budget despatches of this year and           last.   It is not possible immediately to convert a department taken over           from military into an efficient and economical machine for civil purposes,           but we are doing our best.    (6) Above excludes railway and port which  are destined to be of great public           benefit and whose current expenditure is met out of their earnings.    (7) In addition to above Government has provided some 20 lakhs for agricultural           and municipal loans.    (8) Again municipal administration may be pointed to as of direct benefit.  An           aggregate  sum  of  53  lakhs  is  derived from municipal  taxation, which,           except for a contribution of 4  lakhs to general revenues, is all devoted to           objects of purely local interest, selected and largely controlled by public           bodies.                From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 30th July 1920.     (R.)  9192.   Arab  Defence Force.   Following  observations  may  be of  use.Progress in the matter has hitherto been limited by following :      1. Difficulties in recruiting  owing to attractions of other forms of employment(&quot;corrupt group).     2. Intolerance of any sort of discipline by Arabs.     3. Uncertainty as to future, combined  with decided menace  from associatingthemselves with a Government which they fear may be temporary.     4. Difficulties in obtaining equipment of  civilians and of  officers.   In thesematters we  have received little  assistance  from the  military  authorities  who, untilarmistice, viewed growth of levies with disapproval for obvious reasons.
    5. No  previous traditions or experience  on which to  build.   Turks  seldom.enlisted Arabs before the war, and regarded them as of doubtful value.    6. Locally enlisted men  will, not leave their homes, and  [corrupt group]  andconsequently unduly amenable to local influences.    7. Arab officers  of good  status have proved almost uniformly unsatisfactory.Those promoted from ranks have generally done  well, but  all require to  be  trainedbefore they can be used.    Most factors will continue to operate in future.  In addition, there is ever presentclanger that Arab force  will be  used for purely political purposes;  this tendencyat Damascus  was  checked by  arrest of Yasin  Pasha who  was  about  to  effect a coup cVetat.    I find  it almost impossible to imagine local Arab army in Mesopotamia would beof value for purposes of offensive against Turks or Kurds who  have infinitely bettermaterial to draw upon.                From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 26th July 1920.    9005.  Debate in House of Commons on 23rd June, and leader in Times of 24thJune, impel me to offer a few comments as to alleged unpopularity of  Indians inMesopotamia.   Arabs are prejudiced against non-Mohammedan Indians on religiousgrounds.  This disability Indians share in common with all  non-Mohammedan races,including ourselves.    Secondly. Arabs have a certain prejudice against certain  backward races andclasses of Indians who have been  introduced  into this  country in various  capacities,whom  they regard as inferiors in civilisation and  to  whose general conduct they take exception,  e.g.,  Burmese  motor drivers  who during past two months  havemurdered about ten Arabs in Kirkuk division on one pretext or another.    Thirdly. In Basra there is a certain prejudice against Indian petty shopkeepers,who by keener competition tend to secure  trade which would otherwise go to Arabs.This phenomenon is not restricted to Mesopotamia.    There is, however, no prejudice against Indian troops, whose behaviour has been almost invariably exemplary from the point of view of the local inhabitants.  Thereis little  fraternisation,  but no racial feeling.  On  the contrary many thousands  ofIndian soldiers have  visited  principal shrines  in this country during the  past  threeyears, and  in no single case has any trouble resulted as far as I know, nor have the half dozen or so Indian Mohammedan officials employed in executive positions in theCivil Administration  experienced any difficulty owing to racial prejudice.  They are probably more  satisfactory to the  Arab populations than the Turks  whose  place theyhave taken, and only last week when I visited Baqubah and met all  principal notablesand  chiefs of district, they formally complained to rae of inefficiency and corruptionof Arab subordinate  staff  of Irrigation  Department,  who  in pursuance  of  generalpolicy have recently replaced Indians in this Department, and asked for more  indians to be sent,  in order that loss and unfair division of water might be prevented. I needhardly say that complaints  of this sort  will not  deter me from pursuing policy of replacing Indians by Arabs wherever possible, but  it emphasises  necessity of trainingArabs before they are placed  in such positions  and indicates desirability of cautiousrather than drastic reduction, vide your telegram of 19th July.     References in House of Commons to increase of taxation from one million to fiveare, I  trust,  sufficiently disposed of by my telegram 8934, dated 24th July.  T thinkit is important that this last statement should be promptly denied.   I will commentseparately on question of local defence force.
