S. c.THE WAR OFFICE,         Uh August,  1920.Sir,                                                           3rd August, 1920.    I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge the receipt of TreasuryLetter No.  E./589  of 13th  July,  on the subject  of  delay in  replying  to enquiriesreceived in Government Departments from  members of the general public, and to saythat a notice has been circulated in the War Office calling attention to the matter.    I am, at the same time, to request  that  the attention of the Lords commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury may be drawn to the following figures showing the reductions of staff which have been effected in the War Office since the Armistice : Date.

Including staff of 366 in Medals Branch, which was specially exempted from reduc-tions On account of the expansion of work. Including staff of 421 in Medals Branch.    The total staff is now only four times the pre-war strength, although, judged by thestandard of incoming correspondence, which is not controllable, the work has not decreasedbelow six times the pre-war amount.  Reductions of staff are, however, continually being-pressed.  In addition, paid overtime work has been reduced from an average of 12 hours a week  to  7 hours, which is  in itself equivalent to a considerable  decrease of staff.Moreover, 25 per cent, of the  higher civil staff serving in 1914 havebeen permanently    * Sir Harry Brittain a8ked the Prime Minister whether he is aware of the great delay which members ofthe general public frequently experience in receiving replies from Government Departments, in sjme casestwo, or even three letters containing questions of vital importance to the inquirer being despatched withouteven a formal acknowledgment in return; and whether he can see his way to issuing instructions whichwill effect an improvement in this direction ?    Mr. Bonar Law:  I shall call the attention  of Departments to my  Hon. Friend&apos;s question, but I mustremind him that the rapid reduction of staffs considered necessary by the Government must inevitably cauaesome inconvenience.    Sir H. Brittain: Is  the Rt. Hon. Gentleman aware that the greater  severity in this particular matter would have saved Ministers much questioning in this House ? -    Mr. Bonar Law : I am sure that it is in the interest of everyone to make as certain as we can that thereis no delay.

transferred  to  other departments, and the  remainder, having been  able to  take littlerest during the past 6 years, are sorely in need of some  relaxation from  the strainthat has been imposed upon them.                              *  .   In addition to the complicated  business qf clearing up  the administrative legaciesof the war, and the heavy task of reconstructing the military forces of the Crown, theCouncil are  faced with a series of difficult military situations in all  parts of the worldwhich call for immediate and unremitting attention.     In these circumstances, Their Lordships  will  appreciate that  it is impossible to guarantee the  prompt and  punctual  discharge  of public business and simultaneously to effect a progressive diminution in the staff employed in the War Office.                                            I am,                                               Sir,                                                 Your obedient servant,                                                      (signed)    H. J.
