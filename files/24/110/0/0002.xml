   (Translation  from the  German  original, )                           A I  JSF.- 3J3 I.  &apos;                               I      Article  102  of the  Peace Treaty of Versailles directs, as follow!        n,The Principal Allied and Associated  Powers undertake to      establish  the&quot;town  of Danzig,  together  with  the rest -of -the -  -.      territory  described in. Article  100,  as  a Free City,.  It will      be placed  undor  the protection  of the League of Nations,&quot;      Article  103  adds:-                      .....-        &quot;A constitution for  the  2&apos;ree  City of  Danzig shall bo drawn      up by the  duly appointed  representatives of  the ?ree City  in      agreement  with a&apos;High  Commissioner  to be appointed by the      League of  Nations *   This  constitution shall  be  placed under      the guarantee of the League of Nations,&quot;          elections of 16th Hay were the  first step in  execution ofthe abo\  provisions.   The duty entrusted to  the duly appointedrepresentatives  of the City of  Danzig is  onorous.   It will requirethe undivided time and attention of this  Constituent  Assembly,      In your labours  I wish you to romember that  I am  at  all  timesready to assist  you to tho best of my power,  but I should  personallyprefer  that you should in the main rely upon yourselves,, and thatthe framings of a Constitution for this ancient city should be  actuallythe work of its  own burghers..      I cannot congratulate myself enough on the mutual loyalty whichis the predominant feature of the relations between the Allied Ad-ministration in Danzig and all thoso with whom I, as Temporary Admin-istrator, have been so glad to co-operate.      Looking back.on the record of the city for a thousand years, one is struck by the vicissitudes through which it has passed.   Good andbad fortune have been Danzig&apos;s inheritance in the past, but abovo alland through all remain clearly visible the traditions of the FreeCity, the records  of which are engraven on every stone in the churohesand public buildings.      In preparing the Constitution of the I^ree City, do not forgetDanzig*s motto &quot;Nec temere nec timide^&quot; \ Act up to the high standardset to you by your forefathers, and make the Constitution a worthysign  that the present generation of burghers not only keep in grate-ful memory the past, but are determined^to carry on the high reput-ation of Danzig in the future.      Recollect that the League of Nations will extend its protection to the city.  The  Constitution, pre]oared by you in agreement withmyself, will be submitted to the&quot;League.   We have, therefore, a double object, both to vjork for the maintenance of the lofty tradit-ions  of Danzig and to prove that Danzig is worthy of being among thefirst children of  the League of Nations, .      I would urge you to expedite the preparation of the Constitution     &amp;at qui cito  dat&quot; is applicable here.  The.sooner the laboursof this Assembly can be finished, the earlier will the City of danzig receive the honour destined for it under the Peace Treaty and receive - I hope at my hands   the Constitution entitling it to therights and privileges of a Free City,,.nflflxJ^ second point I wish to bring before you is in regard to theireaty to be concluded between Danzig and the neighbouring Republicoi Poland.  By the Peace Treaty it is provided in Article 104*that                                                      The/
tosame time as the establishment of the said Preo City.&quot;     Since my arrival in February last, I have endeavoured to ;oavethe way for a Treaty as contemplated in the article to which l&apos; have just referred.   Although it is clearly recognised on bouh sidesthat the future, both o2 Danzig and Poland, will depend iargoiy onthe terms of this Treaty. vb has not been hitherto practicable tosubmit an authoritati/e text of a draft Treaty embodying the wishesand requirements of Danzig and this for the most obvious reasons,viz., the absence of a legislative body electod by the people.     To-day for the first time such a body exists, and I desire withall earnestness to call your special attention to the necessity felt by Danzig to have a draft Treaty prepared for the consideration ofthe Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, who to-day represent the signatories of the Peaco Treaty!     So&quot; soon as 1 may receive from Danzig and from Poland draftssetting forth on either side their wishes and aspirations, I shallbe able to invite a frank discussion in common, should such bo lo-sired, and then to submit the two projects to the Ambassadors in.?aris for their decision in conformity with the provisions ofArticle 104*     To carry out this important duty, I would urge that a Committeebe appointed without delay from your number for the special consid-eration of questions affecting the Treaty with Poland,   I would suggest that the deliberations of this special Committee bo withheld from publication.     Given the number of intelligent men who have already devotedso much thought to matters connected with tho Treaty, I do not anticipate that more than a few weeks will be required to complete the labours of such a Committee as I propose.  I can only add thatexpedition in this respect will be distinctly to the advantage ofthe future Free City, and I commend this matter to you in theconfident hope that all success may attend your labours, with whichI shall be ever proud to havo been associated,     I declare the Constituent Assembly open.
