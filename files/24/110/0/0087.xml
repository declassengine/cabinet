ill -  ., A^%^e/^lU&apos;Li. /-This  document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^  Govefament    ^5THE  CABINET.BRITISH  RAILWAYS  IN  MESOPOTAMIA.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate herewith a telegram  from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,    121Mesopotamia, on the subject of British railways in that country.                      &quot;&quot;&quot;   3                                                                    W. S. C.     W  THE WAR OFFICE,         10 August, 1920.         FROM GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, MESOPOTAMIA, TO  WAR OFFICE.                       Despatched 11th August, 1920, 1935; received 13th, 1200.(No. X 9753, cipher.)     Part 1. Your No.  85432,  M.R. 2, 2nd July.  1.  Approximate  cost of detailedsurvey (?) Kingarban to Arbluel,  13,000/.   No officer available at present in Mesopotamiaat present  for  survey.  Preliminary reconnaissance done in  1918-19.   Cost of con-struction, Kingarban to Arbluel, not less than 1,668,000/. (exclusive of rolling stock andlocomotives, for which, at present price, 320,000/. at least required).     Improbable that India could supply any of this stock&quot;  Above based on 50db. railscosting 20/. per ton in England.     2. Cost of survey of Baghdad to Hit line, 10,000/.  Preliminary reconnaissancealready done.  Cost of construction on standard gauge,  utilizing material for existing(?) Samarrah Shergat line, not less than 690,000/.  Existing rolling stock sufficient for military traffic only while Baghdad Samarrah section maintained.  The route mostsuitable for  military purposes  would ^permit  extension westwards and would  serveprobable commercial demands.   All figures based on 2s. rupees.   Estimates provide forlines lightly equipped, but of permanent nature.                ,     Part 2. 3.  Any estimate  of  saving in troops  and transport must be purelyacademical  in present conditions, which compel entire  reconsideration of question ofgarrison and its distribution.  Presupposing reasonably certain security on lines but (?)in provision of blockhouses or railway  armoured motor  cars and tanks,  it is probablethat garrison (?) of the. i^uphrates and Kirkuk areas might be reduced  from a brigade,with cavalry, artillery (?) and Engineers attached  in each case to a battalion, with acorresponding reduction in transport, in addition to transport required for  Machine GunCorps.  This last is estimated for the Kirkuk line to amount  to (?)  9   (?)  Ford  vancompanies,  1 Mechanical Transport company (50 3-ton lorries), jjL  Army  transport companies and hired transport costing some rupees 50,000 a month.     Part 3. On  the Ket lighters this saving would be the amount of river craft  to lifta (?) 100 tons a day.   Civil Commission (?) has already  expressed general concurrenceand has urged construction of both lines according to  (?) telegram No. (?) 6323 of28th November, (?) 1919, (?)  and  (one group undecipherable) 48 of  9th June,  1920.He contemplates a branch line on the metre gauge from Baqubah to  Samarrah  whichwill  serve  that  town and an  important agricultural district much  better than theexisting standard gauge railway.  At the same time he  points out  that  it  cannot be guaranteed that  the  (?) Kingarban line would  pass through Arbluel  town as fromAltunkupri.  Investigation may prove other alignments to be better.     4th and last part. The- first need  on  this  line is to reach (?) Kirkuk.    civil commissioner further  emphasizes  the  fact that existing  lines require considerable expenditure to complete, and that at present there are  great difficulties in obtainingpersonnel.     A consideration  of the  Baqubah Samarrah line  and  the extension to  Mosulvia (?) Kirkuk is strategically desirable, line would be more difficult to defend than thatrunning up right  bank of Tigris.                 *
