(jHIS DOCTO^TT IS THff PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET.                                                         Q                      IRISH SITUATION COMMITTEE.Note by Mr, Long,     I think the Cabinet should be aware that the irish situation Committee, which met to-day in the House ofCommons, were unanimous and most emphatic on two points(1)   that the  Government  must)  in the first     instance, devote the whole of its     energies  to the  suppression of crime  in     Ireland and that until order has been     restored  the chances of arriving at a     compromise on the details  of the Govern-     ment of Ireland  Bill are greatly     jeopardised:(2)   that, if  it is necessary,  the Government     should be prepared to make large and     considerable concessions with regard tothe Finance of the Bill.     The feeling of the Committee on these two pointswas expressed with considerable force, and 1 think it important the Cabinet should be acquainted with it.
