Military Secret.1418         From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,   *                                2nd August 1920.                (Repeated to General  Officer Commanding. Baghdad)                                 (Received 3rd.)    9936.  2nd  part.   4. Of  the Indian battalions above  earmarked for disband-ment, approximately 50 per cent, are Gurkha, the disbandment of which has  been continuously  urged  on us by  the  Nepal Durbar.  Moreover, delay in disbandmentmilitates against the reorganisation of the Indian Army. - In this  connection it shouldbe noted that some battalions earmarked for disbandment are included in the leadingdivision for Mesopotamia, detailed in nay 9393 of  20th July, balance  being provided from those originally proposed  for overseas  relief.  We have now had to earmark intheir  place for overseas relief some  battalions  originally intended for disbandment,thus  departing  somewhat from  policy  mentioned  in para.  2  (c) of our  9618 of26th July.     5. By utilising units earmarked for overseas reliefs  a complete breakdown inour  relief  arrangements  will be inevitable.  This will entail the present retentionoverseas of several Indian units which have already served for more  than five yearscontinuously ex India.   Moreover, the possibility of effecting their relief next year, andalso relief of further units which will  by then have completed live years ex India  willbe.seriously disturbed  if not&apos;rendered impossible.  This will necessarily engender aserious feeling of discontent which may have grave consequences.     6.  Following appear to be the only alternatives to carrying out reliefs :      (a)  Reduction  of Indian portion of overseas garrisons other than in Mesopotamia.     (b) Relief by draft of  large proportion of Indian personnel now  serving in           overseas garrisons with a  view to withdrawing to this country all due for           demobilisation and those who have served  continuously overseas for  four           years or more.     7. Latter method  will upset whole of system of maintenance and  will be undulycomplicated.  It is  also open to following additional objections : 1     (a)  Cadres  of  units must remain overseas which will  contain high proportion of           personnel who have been  longest out of India.     (?))  A large increase in number of recruits will  be required  to give effect to this           method.  This will not only  entail expansion of present reduced  depot           staffs and  involve  difficulties regarding accommodation, but will later on           necessitate a return  to&apos; system of bounties in  order to  attract recruits.           Amount of bounty required will be notified later.                In  short, this system will take time to initiate, and will even then be of           doubtful military expediency.     8. In view of  the fact that units have been compulsorily retained overseas forlong periods, and that units now proceeding are being sent without the leave to whichthey are entitled by Regulations we strongly urge that question of grant of a foreignallowance  to all British officers and Indian troops serving overseas should be taken upforthwith, and we consider that this  would be an opportune time to introduce such  ameasure.  Full  details regarding  such  allowance will be  subject of a later&quot;  com- munication.      9. As it will take some  time  to set up necessary recruiting machinery, please cable early what action, if any, you wish  taken in  respect of  proposals in paras. 6 and 7 above.      10. .If British  medical officers  and personnel   to  be posted to medical units mentioned in para.  2 above have to be replaced from home we will let you know the numbers required.
