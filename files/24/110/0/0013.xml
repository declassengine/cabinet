Kote by the Minister of Transport.       I circulate to the Cabinet a copy of a letterwith enclosures which I have addressed to the lord privy Seal relative to the Reports of the&quot; SelectCommittee on National Expenditure.S JB C.R B T.Copy Ho.c.p.-in.(Initialled)    E,G,MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, 3.W,July gist 1980;.
                                       SO July, 1020*My dear Eonar Law,                         :-      I understand&apos; that the debate on the Ministry ofMunitions Vote will take place next Wednesday.and that,.-that  is being arranged in order  to afford an opportunityof discussing the. Report of the  Select Committee on national Expenditure,  I would therefore like  to make some  comment upon the way in which this Committee operates,as I  myself had  a recent, and not altogether a. happyexperience of its methods.      A Sub-Committee of the Select Committee  recentlyinvestigated, the Ministry of Transport Estimates.&apos;  Thewhole .tone of the Report was given by the  postscript, whichreferred to the  Ministry as. &quot;grandiose&quot;: by the postscriptI mean  that this word was used in the last paragraph ofthe Report.      So far as  practical substance was concerned, noadverse comment  was passed on any single penny that had/been  spent.,., and  apart from questions of the policy involved - which is, I understand, outside the scope ofthe Committee -  the whole public controversy ranredround the  staff  employed.      As regards the staff of the Ministry, no expenditure was condemned, no reduction was  suggested, and in  effect,the Committee&apos;endorsed  the expenditure on  staff  in  everyDepartment by providing  in each Department  for  an increase.      The  elements forming  the Sub-Committee were  clearly  -as  I  fear  is unavoidable  in  such a Committee - of  diverseshades  of  opinion, and  the Report was  therefore  a  compromise-mise.  There were those who  for  various reasons  wishedto  condemn any Ministry  and  any  expenditure, and  therewere  others who  saw  the  value of the work  done,  and who did not wish  to  restrict  it.  We therefore ^ot a Reportfthich in  substance confirmed  everything  that had been                                     prejudicedone, but  which  in phraseology  imparted/to such  an extent
      I                    H   -                           54that the true merits of the Report  were obscured.   Further,the Report has several grave inaccuracies  in it,      It seems to me that, in the first place,  it  isfundamentallywrong, if such an investigation is  intendedto be just and j..4 ,  that a Committee - going into  a Depart-ment for three or four days -? should issue a Report,  withoutin any way trying to clear up points of difference or correctinaccuracies by conference with the Department before theypublish it.  Nor can it be in the public interest  that theReport of a Committee such as this  should  be given to thePress and made public, so that the  Press - by taking  wordsout of their content - can convey in the first instance,before the Department has an opportunity to say anything  inits defence, a totally unfavourable and erroneous  impression.      The Select Committee appears  to be indignant that theMinistry of Munitions was fortunately able to publish itsown answer simultaneously with the publication of  the Report,and I wonder whether a debate would give an opportunity tothe Government to&apos; suggest that these Reports should not bemade public until they have been discussed by the  committee with the Department, and that the Department^ reply shouldbe published simultaneously, by including the reply in the document wnich presents the Report to the  House of Commons.      Then again, while undoubtedly certain members of theSub-Committee which came to the Ministry of Transport weredesirous of being fair, the whole procedure of this Committeeappears to me not onlv to be unfair, but also ia in factoffensive.      The procedure is that the Committee  comes to the De-partment; they say which witnesses they wish to hear; they         ofbring out/all perspective the particular points upon whichthey see a possibility of attacking the Department, and theylead the evidence in these directions.  The witness is not permitted u. put in a proof of his&apos; evidence, nor is any opportunity given to the Ministry to re-examine the witnessor to tender further evidence on the points.
                             -  3  -          During the proceedings  of  the  investigation ofthe Ministry of Transport  expenditure, and  at a  late sta(?e, Iintimated to the Chairman in session,  through the parliamentary secretary of the Ministry,  that if there were any points on which the                                       rCommittee were not satisfied,  I,  who had been the first witness,wished an opportunity of giving evidence on those points agaim  Iwas never calledi          Then againj as shoeing  the attitude of the Committee andthe defenceless position in which a  Department  is put, one is deniedrepresentation during the  examination of witnesses  on your Department          Sir Hardman Lever was examined by the  Committee in cameraon the work of my Department.   &quot;In this particular case, Sir HardaanLever is so much in touch and in  sympathy with  the  needs of theMinistry, that no possible question  oould arise.    He has told me ofthe evidence which he gave, and I am sure it was all most helpful,but the mere fact that a Ministry under  investigation is treated inthis way indicates the attitude of mind  of  the  Select Committee.          I suggest that it is entirely  foreign to  justice that any-one should have an investigation  into their work by a Committee, andthat they should be excluded from the room  when any witnesses arebeing examined.  Further,  having  taken the  evidence, ^and having madea verbatim shorthand note  of the  evidence upon  which the Committeemakes its Report...the Ministry is denied a  copy of  that evidence.          After the enquiry, I requested tha Secretary of theMinistry- of Transport to ask for  a  copy  of  the  evidence.  This was refused, the request being made over the telephone. Subsequently -owing to the controlled Railway Companies having raised a question asto the accuracy of a portion of the  Committee&apos;s Report - I had anofficial letter written on the 26th  Jiily-, asking for a copy of theminutes of evidence taken by the  Committee.  This was refused,, andthe attached letter from Colonel  Gretton speaks for itself.          Apart altogether from the  personnel of the Committee, Ithink that if an opportunity offersj the Government would have thefull sympathy of the House in so  modifying  the  procedure of theCommittee as to prevent this very unfair treatment  of the Departments
&quot; A- *.At the present time, doino; our duty as we believe we are in all      Ematters of economy, and &quot;dth the temper of the public and the Press  j&apos;as it is, it is imperative in the public interest that    should havethe fairest and mOst impartial enquiry into ^Hat *ire are doing.  Weare not getting that to-day.  vJe are treated V.B criminals, -who haveno right to hear the evidence given when thoir c^se is tried) and weare denied a  ?opv  of the evidence so that we can see on what state-ments the &quot;Report of the Committee is based.          I therefore hope that, if an opportunity offers^ ii may bepossible so to aKe.&apos; one methods of the Committee as to give a department a fair  qpportunity,  at any rate,  of stating  its otise, ofcriticising the findings of  the  Committee on the evidence, arid ofgiving  its reply simultaneously and publicly to the  charges made against  it.
