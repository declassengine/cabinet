              (This Document is the Property of                   * ^             His Britannic Majesty^ Government.)             0Q.P.-1780,              0 ABI.O T.                     jTOggjgS OOMPENSATIOH. &apos;         &apos;ygmor^.di^uJby the^ chancellor ellor et the BXPhequer If          leglslati vePpf:o&apos;oogals of the E?me Secretary,&quot;      The  legislative proposals outlined in the memorandum of^tne  Hom**  SeAreiiar^  raise a number of important and even con- trsversial qu ft afri.ArifkJB.hl oh - re quire very full-^nsjjlaratijoru Moreover  they involve additional expenditure on a number of heads  in  which the  Treasury is directly interested,                 1.     AS Tu EXPMDITIHIB,      (a)   Increase  in benefits.   The&apos;prop-osalfl involve an ln- crease of more than.double the existing scale.      The  benefits  in the case of death are greatly augmented - But this  increase ia to give further.ass 1st anc-e Godchildren;  and as the  death benefits  amount to no more than 17$ of the total expenditure,  I do  not think that any objection can reasonably be taken to  the  proposals on this head.      But  in regard  to the amount of weekly payment in cases of incapacity, while  I agrea that the general scale -should be  /grds of the loss of earnings. I feel the greatest&quot;6.doubt of the propriety of raising the maximum as high as  3, as the majority of the Committee propose.     This means that the so$le of  /3r&amp;s would operate in full as-jregards^all JworJLers--drawingr&quot;&apos;V/agea up to 90/- a                * week.   It must be  remembered that the proposals now under consideration pre  to form part of a permanent enactment, and I do not think  that  the present abnormal conditions form a trust- worthy-basis  of assessment.   It appears to me that in view of existing  circumstances it would not be Reasonable to increase the  weekly payment  for incapacity (now 20/- and 35/-) beyend a maximum of 50/- a week - which would give  the full scale of 2/3rds up to a wage  of 75/- a week.   It would be a simple matter to raise the maximum if hereafter it were found desirable to do so.                                                          But
   But  it  -oube  impracticable  to  endeavour to reduce tho maximum, if events should  prove  an excessive amount nad been fixed.  Ilore- over,  there cannot be left out of account the important question that the higher the  compensation the greater is the tendency to postpone the resumption of work.  Any  delay in the resumption of work which might  be  encouraged by too high a maximum would work a  radical change  in  the economic position.  An undue protraction of claims for even a few days would add enormously to the gross expenditure on compensation, and would also result in a further falling off in productive energy.   In  this context I draw atten- tion to the Home Secretary&apos;s observation on page 6 of his Memorandum as to  the effect of the  &quot;Waiting Period&quot; in artificially extending the duration  of incapacity,       The additional cost to the State as an employer of Labour consequent on the  adoption of a  maximum rate of 60/- would be roughly  250,000  a year, upon an estimate proportional to the present rates; and to this should be added a further increase of uncertain amount, if the view that  the  3 maximum would tend to the undue protraction of claims  is  as I believe, well-founded,,       If the maximum is fixed at 50/-  the State bill for compensa- tion would be increased by about  180,000 a year, and would be much less subject  to further increase  resulting from an extension of the period a workman remains  off work.       The disparity  moreover, which is apparent between payments for non-industrial and  payments  for industrial disease or accident, should not be unduly widened.  The  raising of the maximum to  3 a  week under the  Workmen1s Compensation Act will be likely to disturb the working  of  the National Health Insurance Acts, and promote a strong  demand for increased  benefits thereunder, which the State may not be able to meet.m      Having in mind, therefore, the above considerations, and  the present unstable  conditions, I agree with the conclusions formed by the Representatives  of the Ministry cf Health  and the Treasury arid by the Government Actuary,, appearing  in  their Resell at ion  to the                                                       Committee !s
Committee&apos;s Report; and I think - &quot;thaVno - hi^errv.jnaxlwun-^tJaan50/- a week should be approved.     (b)  The Majority recommend the creation of a specialDepartment, called the &quot;Commissioner&apos;s&quot;Department, in whom would be vested all the existing functions under the Workmen&apos;compensation Act and the further&quot;duties Imposed by the extendedproposals.  It is stated that  the cost of an expanded Government-Department to carry out these various duties should not exceed 30,000 a year.  I am not aware that the Committee had any evidence before them, or had any expert knowledge, on which to base this opinion;  and I regard this estimate as quite untrust-worthy.  Until it is determined what functions the new Departmentshall undertake, it is manifestly impossible to formulate anyaccurate estimate of cost.  But a reference ts the new duties which the Home Secretary proposes should be undertaken by the&quot;Commissioner&apos;s Department satisfies me that a Department ofconsiderable size at a substantial cost would&apos; be required.      Having regard to the main functions which the department would be called on to perform I think that the general, administr;tion could be best exercised by the Ministry of Health, withwhose functions the proposed duties are most closely allied.Workmen13 Compensation is largely a Health question, one mainconsideration being the restoration of earning capacity*  Theadded duties, which it is now recomitended._shou.id be statutorilyimposed; fall almost entirely within the scope of the Ministry ofHealth.  It would appear inconvenient that the officers of theMinistry of Health) who would be cailed^on to carry out themajority of the statutory duties, should be placed under thecontrol of, and derive their authority from, another Department.
2,   COMPULSORY INSURANCE.     The recommendation in favour of Compulsory Insurance isa matter on which I fool a grave doubt.   Tho Treasury is not directly interested in this question, save to the extent of thoadministrative cost of a &quot;compulsory system.   On tho general question of policy, I doubt the necessity for the introductionof Compulsion;  and I draw attention to the arguments adducedby the Treasury representative  in his dissenting tlomorandumto the report of the Majority.   It is obvious that tho intro-duction of Compulsion involves a measure of State control, and inso far as it may lead to complete Nationalisation of the systemof Accident Insurance, it should not be adopted^     Compulsion, it is clear., will necessitate a full system of inspection throughout tho kingdom^ tho inquisitorial natureof which will not be woacomod by the community.   It will alsobe necessary to sot up machinery for enforcing observance of the law and the institution of criminal process in casesof default.   In this  context it is to be remembered that thoform of Compulsion advocated is to insuro with insurance companies who are  commercial concerns trading for a profit.It is obvious that such a measure must be: accompanied by somestatutory provisions for tho restriction of profit,   Themeasure of a State control which is proposed, is such as is contained in the Agreement concluded with tho Tariff Offices.             3*  IN REGARD TO THE TARIFF OFFICES AGREE? IE NT,     I understand  that this Agreement provides that 70^ of 100 premium is to be applied in benefits to workmen, and ofthe balance of 30$, 5/ is to be expended in  agents&apos; commissionand the remaining  25% is applicable  to cost  of administration and profit.   Of this 25;;&apos; it is presumed that about 5&apos;i would                        ^ rm                       represent/
     represent profit *    Those percentages are  of  course of the  tV  Companies1  gross premium income, which  in  the  immediate future     may amount  to   10,000,000 annually.   The  B% profit would     thus po  BF  on  GROSS  turnover;  and  far greater  than the     equivalent  of  a  5?: dividend  on net profits.          But whilst  the  Agreement  with tho  Tariff  Offices  (oi some     other profit-restricting arrangement) is  on essential complement     to  a vieasure of  Compulsion,  yet Compulsion is  not essential to     the working of the Agreement *    Much is to be  said in favour     of  dropping Compulsion and adopting the Tariff Offices ,,/7rce-     mcnt, in order to  bring about  tho  mono  economical administration     it  proniso3.   And to  that extent  I think  the  Agreement should     be  adopted  and an  improved voluntary system thereby put in     oporation.          In  any view of  tho matter, however,  there arc  certain     features in the  Tariff Offices Agreement,  wh;ch need  scrutiny.     In  particular, I would ask whether- sufficient  authority is     left to  the Government Department  in fixing premium rates.     The Agreement  secures  to the Tariff Offices a  compact body of     representation on  such a Committee amounting  to one half.     This In  itself would practically secure control to the     Companies.    But it  may bo assumed.that the non-Tariff offices     or  Lloyds1  would claim to have a voice  in the  fixing  of tho     rates, in which  ca3G the insurance interest would have an     actual majority  in fixing the amount of premiums, which tho     Companies  themselves arc to  rocoivo,                                (Initialled)   A.  G,Treasury, S.v.r.     17th August 1920.         ^
