All indicationspoint to a strike of the miners, if not of the engineers, duringthe second half of September and this may develop into a realstruggle.   The plans of the strikers in collusion with the Co-operative Society are much tetter laid than they were last year,and it is essential that no time ohovld be lost in maturing plans for the safety of food supplies, public services and means ofcommunication, especially as the Transport V/orkers - or sectionsof them - may join in the strike.     The Labour Research Bureau in Eccleston Square will becomegradually the &quot;General Staff for Labour&quot; when a large strike takes place.     The masters are quite firm that the time has arrived forresisting the perpetual demands for higher wages, and if a struggleis to come they would rather have it now.     The position is complicated by growing unemployment, largely due to the present state of uncertainty about wages and prices.     A demonstration of 10,000 es-service men was held yesterdayat Liverpool to protest against unemployment of ex-soldiers.  Itwas not an ordinary meeting; the men were labouring under a realgrievance, which they seemed determined to have remedied.   Violentspeeches were made and enthusiastically applauded.   The Lord Mayorhas promised to see the men to-day.     The great mass of labour remains sound, but it is irritatedwith the Government over a number of grievances, such as high prices, housing and the rise in railway fares, and tywir irritationhas been fanned by irresponsible newspapers.   The extremists donot disguise their feeling that a strike is to be their greatopportunity.                                                           She/   ,
     The Left Wing of the National Guilds&apos; League seems lifcflto join the United Communist Party and will add considerably to its strength.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has accepted a money subsidy from thSoviet Government.     There is still very strong feeling among Trade Unionistsagainst a strike on behalf of Ireland.
     Every indication now points to serious and widespreadLabour troubles during the latter half of September, thoughthe cross currents that affect all Labour movements maydefer the date.   There have been many private meetings between employers during the last few weeks and they seemto be resolved not to pay higher wages and to stake everythinupon being in a position to quote prices on a basis of a two years&apos; guarantee that claims for higher wages would notbe made.   The Temporary Regulation of Wages Bill, 1918,will expire on September 30th; there will then be no machinerfor increases:  in other words, employers and employed willrevert to collective bargaining without the intervention ofany Government machinery.   The employers think that if thestruggle must come, it had better come now and it had bettercome all at once rather than piecemeal.   They would ratherit began by strikes than by look-outs,   ^     According to present indications they will not have long to wait: probably the strikes will begin with the coalminors, and the transport workers - or a section of them -may follow.   The engineers are in a very restless state andit may be a race between an engineers1 strike and a cessation of industry from shortage of coal.   Whichever way it is,there will be wide-spread unemployment.     The great mass of working men are against violent ,revolution, but at the moment they are very sore about anumber of minor points such as high prices, shortage ofhouses and the impending rise of railway fares in holidaytime - grievances which the press might have done much to ,alleviate had they cared to explain rather than to exploit.     There is to be a &quot;No Rent Strike&quot; in September and inLondon street upon street will passively refuse to pay rent                                                      when/

The result of all this     is that the Government is made to take the entire blame and     has hardly a friend, in the labour or small shop&amp;eeper world     The stoady body of Labour is so much irritated that it has  &quot;  lost its steadying effect.          The immediate plan is to feed the strikers through the     Co-operatives, but the hot-heads look much further and     dream of seizing the machinery of government by a coup.     Unfortunately, the demands for troops to be sent to Ireland   ,  have drained England of all but a fraction of the military     assistance that may be needed by the civil power.   Though     London is strong enough through its Police, its reserve of     Special Constables and Its garrison to deal with any such .....attempt, steps ought to be taken as quickly as&apos; possible to     meet the great shortage of:Special Constables and troops th&amp;     may be required in the crowded centres on the Clyde and in     Lancashire, where there is a strong body of Sinn Feiners,     some of whom are armed.&apos;   The difficulty in obtaining Special     Constables outside London is well known.          Meanwhile no time ought to be,lost in proceeding with     the Smergenoy Laws Bill.THIS COAL umms                                        .....          Bo steps are likely to be taken towards a ballot until     August 12th,  when the leaders return from Geneva.   There is     therefore time for educating public  opinion regarding their     claims and for turning to account the hostility felt towards     the miners by other workers.          The extremists regard a miners&apos;  strike as merely a prel     to a  general  strike.    In his pamphlet &quot;The Social General     Strike&quot;  Jack  Tanner,  who  is now in Russia,  pointed out that     a  coal strike would paralyse  every industry.                I
                               &quot;x  3 &quot;*           In  South Wales  there is ,a movement  to drop the demand      for a reduction  in prices and to..double  the demand for      increased wages.             .  ^........       -j           Frank Hodges has heen in Yorkshire  during the week,      proclaiming the  necessity for closing working arrangements      with  the Co-operatives.   In this  area every village      public-house  is  a debating society and to Judge,from the talk      there will certainly be. a strike if all  the demands are not      conceded; but on the other hand, there is no means, of      gauging how the  silent  and apathetic majority will vote      when the ballot  comes.   In  Lancashire the miners think   :   that their wages compare unfavourably with th&amp;se of the      cotton operatives:   public opinion,1  however, is unsympathetic.      In Derbyshire, Mr. Frank Hall, the General Secretary, stated   ;:.   on the 18th that he  considered the reduction in the price      of coal the more important of the  demands.   In Warwickshire     the miners are not sanguine.   The Scottish miners1 wives      and the older men are afraid of a  strike, but the young      unmarried miners are looking forward to  it as the precursor   .   to revolution.   The Miners&apos; Federation  is considering the      question of calling  out the  engine,  pump and fan&apos;men.&apos;/          There are indications of local  collusion between the      miners and transport workers and *th is may become a Very      serious, faotor.   The miners do not  Care about the railway     men as they say  they can stop the  railways&apos;in a week..UNEMPLOYMENT                           .  .;          Increasing unemployment is reported. ,  It is no doubt      owing to the uncertainty whether any rate contracted for   1  will be adhered  to that so.-,many orders are being cancelled.     there is a marked depression in all  &quot;luxury trades&quot;, but     even the engineers in Glasgow and  elsewhere are affected and     the men themselves are forecasting a &quot;slump&quot; in industry,                                                    v    with/
     with serious consequences to the workers during the coming     winter.   Unfortunately, they turn to their usual panacea     of shorter hours as a guarantee against unemployment;  many     of the branch unions hate agreed to work no overtime in     the hope that additional employment may, be found.          In the iron and steel trades in Lanarkshire labour     leaders are beginning to talk of Syndicalism as their only     remedy; they say that the masters are doing their best to     provoke a crisis and when it comes it will be a fight to a     finish.LABOUR AND IRELAND.          A correspondent who attended an important meeting of     northern Trade Union delegates during the week-end reports     that most of the delegates were sick of the Irish question     and when asked their views said, &quot;To hell with Ireland&quot;.     It is unlikely, he says, that any vote will be taken on      &quot;Direct Action for Ireland&quot;, because it might split the     Unions.   There seemed to be a ginaral feeling among the     delegates that their leaders had gone too far in meddling     in politics when their proper duty was to look after the     interests of their Unions.   A textile delegate was cheered     when he said that if the Government could not keep order it     had better get out and let the Irish kill one another off.     &quot;We don!t care what they do../Why don&apos;t they flog every     man caught in possession of arms, if there are too many to     put in gaol, and shoot every man who resists arrest?   If     they would go for the country as if they meant business,     every rebel would be afraid to put his nose out of doors     and things would settle down.&quot;          There seems to be a strong body of Trade Unionists     who would vote against &quot;Direct Action for Irelandand a     growing feeling that too much time and money are wasted on                                                        &quot;useless/
     &quot;useless conferences.&quot;AGRICULTURAL WORKERS          Agitators in the eastern  counties are meeting with     resiDtance.   The labourers  object  to paying  subscriptions     and, seeing that the richer  farmers when paying  increased     wages have dismissed all  except their best workers,  the     men throw the blame upon  the;Union,   It. Light be a  good     moment for counter propaganda.          There is a movement  abroad to  establish  an  International     Federation of Agricultural Workers  on the initiative of the     Dutch Union, who have called a conference in  Amsterdam on     August l?th.   Representatives of the&apos;British Unions have     acoepted the invitation.THE fDAILY HERALD&quot;  ,,          Astonishing,figures  have been received of.the    ; expenditure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in pushing  its sales.     During *me week the distribution of leaflets: and pamphlets     in Scotland amounted to over a million,, copies and 500.000     free copies of the paper  itself were distributed in  Glasgow     on July.18th.

GROWTH OF REVOLUTIONARY FEELING -                    -            My Yorkshire correspondent reports an increasing       sale of Bolshevik literature and in the attendance at       extreme meetings.  For the first time,  a&quot;number of       respectable and well-dressed workers are in evidence at       such meetings,  asking questions end agreeing with the       speakers,  especially on Russia;  he thinks that the       conflicting stories of people from&apos;Russia have-stimulated       interest and enquiry. :  Unfortunately Bertrand Russell&apos;s       damaging criticism of the  Soviets in &quot;The Nation&quot; has not       had a wide Circulation,&apos;but it has made trie Glasgow     j     -&apos; Tevolu^ijoriarieaVery -afigry. ^f^?2?2? -:;  1      r&apos;F    .

jg-SBRVIOB MB           The meeting of the National Union in Hyde Park on      July 25th v/as attended by about 1,000 people.  There was      Some disturbance because on a neighbouring platform a      Union Jack was displayed; the flag tvas forcibly removed      and in the struggle seven people were arrested and fined      at Marlborough Street Police Court.  Money was freely      thrown on the platform after the arrests.  The meeting in      Trafalgar Square on the same day wee unimportant; only      about 400 people were present.  Gilmore, the leader of      the Bristol marchers, made a very violent speech against      recruiting and in favour of mutiny.  His supporters came      ohiefly from Camber;;ell and Rornsey, and, in spite of a      whip,  Trade Union representatives were absent.THE gOLIOg STRIKERS           Hayes, one of the leaders of the Police strike,  has      been adopted Labour candidate for the 3dgehill Division of      Liverpool.SINK mm IN GRISAT BRITAIN  -     :           Sinn Pein organisations appear to. be ,making - a      certain amount of progress;  in lierthyr,  for instance,  50      members have joined the Irish Self-Determination League      during th e  last fo rtnigh t.   In oreas/es are also rep o rted      from North  Staffordshire,  Sheffield,  Derby,  Manchester,      Birmingham  and London.          On July 25th the meeting on Parliament Hill Pields      was attended by about 500  people and was addressed by      Sean Harvey,  Mrs; Lancaster,  Michael Mb Grata, and  Art      OVBrien.  A &quot;Hands  off Ireland&quot;  meeting was  also held  in  i    Trafalgar Square  on July 24th;  the  audience,  which numbered      about  300,  was not  enthusiastic  and  the  speeches call  for   s  no  special  comment:  Jack Sullivan,  a member  of the                                                        provisional
                          Mt Q M     Provisional Council of Sylvic PankhurstTs Communist     Party, has been making violent speeches on the Irish     question in the Metropolis.          About 4,CH0 people attended a Sinn Fein,meeting in     the Liverpool Stadium on July 25th at which  Sean Milroy     and Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington were the chief speakers.          Sean Milroy has been in the Glasgow area, and has     visited Sinn Fein priests and other leading  Irishmen.     A series of large meetings are to be organised for Glasgow     and all large industrial centres, and will take place     at the end of August or the beginning of September.   The     speakers&apos; will include Arthur Griffith ,  D, IJahpny,     Sean Milroy, and Cathal 0&apos;Shannon.          The Scottish Sinn Fein organiser,  Jaok 0&apos;Sheehan,     has been addressing meetings in the North of Scotland and     laying the foundations of new clubs in districts     hitherto unrepresented.          It is reported that Irish Catholic  Priests and the     Sinn Fein organisation are working in closer connection     than heretofore.   With the development  of Sinn Fein     tactics on a more intensive scale in Ireland and the     Priests and leading Irishmen in the West of Scotland have     become increasingly active in fostering  hatred, between     the religious factions and between English and Irish.     The Priests aro taking a prominent part  in Sinn Fein     deliberations at Clubs from whence propaganda chiefly     emanates,  and by the example of these men a number of     converts has been secured.IRELAND          The informal conversations with.Sinn Fein leaders on     the subject of compromise have been continued, but there is     nothing special to report.  , So far Sinn Fein will not                                                         listen/
 listen to  any suggestion for excluding any part of Ulster. Nevertheless, it  is  quite evident  that they are afraid of the  Bolshevik element Which  is arising in their own-ranks owing to, association with the Transport Workers,  and  they are  increasingly  anxious to  come to  terms with  the Government  on the Dominion basis.    The split in  the  Irish ranks in America  has not been lost upon them,   1 &apos;   &apos;&quot;&apos; ft     it ji   f .! &apos; ,J  fif fj t&apos;5  ffs  r.v,  ;-a      &apos;      The gravity  of  the situation  in Ireland has  increased during the  week.   A species of guerilla warfare  is being carried on  throughout Monster and  Connaught arid to  a  lesser extent in Leinster and  a number of lives have been  lost. Of the 275  outrages  known to the police,  228 were directly attributable  to Sinn Fein, 9 were  of an agrarian  nature and  38 were due to the  prevailing  state of  lawlessness.      The number of raids for arms  increased,&apos; as did the number of cases in which mail cars and trains were  raided or held up, anfl vecated police barracks and buildings burnt.   Intimidation,  in connection with collections  for general  purposes,  was rampant in the South  and  West.      Rioting  of a  sectarian  and political character broke out in  Belfast; about  16  persons are  ::nown  to have been  killed and over 200  wounded,    Numerous arredts were made.      The Assizes were a failure in most places, furors,witnesses,  civil plaintiffs  and defendants  being  afraid to attend.      The Watchword  of  Labour&quot; and &quot;Old  Ireland&quot;, whichwere  issued as usual  for  July  24th,  have been submitted to the Government, the  former  for  its  scandalous  treatment of the murder of Lieut. Col.  Smyth,  and for  its attaok onthe Attorney  General; the latter for  its scarcely Veiledthreats against some  members  of the  Royal  irish constabulary who perform  their duties.      Sinn Fein places little hope  in recognised Sngtyifih                                                  Labour/
Labour leaders but is anxious for an alliance with theextreme element in IDngland.   The railway situation ispractically unchanged.   That the general tone of thecountry is beooming markedly Bolshevist is apparent fromthe reluctance to obey authority of any kind.     Attacks on the military Forces of the Crown haveincreased in number and daring.    One officer lost hislife in one of these ambuscades.   The relations betweensoldiers and the civil population in the disloyal districtsis becoming strained and is likely to continue until therebel forces have received several severe lessons.     In counties Mayo and Tipperary the food question,owing to the Transport difficulties, is causing anxiety toSinn Fein and arrangements are being made to issuefood permits in the name of the Irish Republic.
