              -Th;* .PDC&quot;niCl^ is  ti-te Pioporty ofCirculated by the Secretary of State  for India.ORET.the Causes ol the present Unrest on the Euphrates, by Major H. H. F. M.Tyler, C.I.E., Political Officer at Hillah, dated 3rd August 1920.     The writer of this note has served as  a Political Officer  in  the  Hillah  division from December 1917  till  the  end of May 1920.  He  has,  therefore,  an  intimate knowledge of the Arabs and their politics, of  that division, which includes the sacredtown of Kerbela ;  he has a close though not intimate knowledge of the neighbouringdivisions of Diwaniyab and Shamiyah, in which disturbances have occurred.     Before his departure from  Mesopotamia at the  end of May, coming events werecasting their  shadows before,  and he  has discussed frequently and at length, the causes of the growing unrest with the most responsible leaders of tribal and  urbanopinion of Hillah Division, who almost without exception, in  the  face of an intensepro-Arab propaganda, had  preserved an attitude of steadfast, loyalty to the Govern-ment which they  recognised as the  only possible  safeguard of  the Arab peoplesagainst the disruptive and destructive  tendencies  which have proved  the  curse olthis  most gifted race.     The three divisions above  named form  the most fertile and thickly populatedarea in Mesopotamia, and as they contain  the  sacred towns of  Kerbela and  Nejef,they are of  first rate importance from a political no less than from  a revenue  pointof view.     They contain a population  of  some 600,000 persons, of whom three-fourths aretribal.  With few exceptions they belong to the Shia sect.     The tribal system is highly developed, each tribe forming  a separate politicalentity, Avith its own system of foreign alliances and foreign  politics, for a parallel towhich in our own country we mast go back to the Ireland of Tudor times.     The  Sheikh,  of  the  tribe  exercises  many of the functions which are ordinarilyassociated with the  execution  by  Governments of  their ordinary functions in more advanced States, and, generally speaking, the tribesman looks to  his  Sheikh, and notto the Government, to protect his rights of  person and of property.     With the advent of  liritish officers dispensing even-handed  justice, appeals aremade  more  and more to British  Political  Officers and  British Courts, but this tendency has not as yet effected any marked change in the position of the Sheikh.     In Turkish times, the authority of the  Government was strong in the  HillahDivision,  weak in Diwaniyah and Shamiyah.   The Turks commonly maintained a force of a  strength, of little less than a brigade at  Diwaniyah,  and even with this force were unable to make any real headway with the task of governing this part ofthe country and collecting the revenues which they claimed.   The tribal area aroundSamawa and Rumeitha  appears to have been in a  normal condition, little  differingfrom that of Ireland of the  present clny.     Further south, the tribes of the Nasarieh. Division had been for some years previousto the war in a state of open and successful insurrection against the Turks.     During the course of the war, oar forces advanced but a short way to the   north of Nasarieh and  the country as far  north as Ramadi was  never occupied in  force,and  never really visualised the might of the British  Government.     After the fall of Baghdad, solitary British Political Officers established themselves at various places on  the  Euphrates, with no  other  support than  the prestige  of theBritish name,  and the goodwill  of some at any rate among the tribes.     Up till the time of  the present trouble, it is probably accurate to state that wenever  had so strong a  military force in the disturbed area as the Turks normallymaintained there.   .     The prestige  of the British name, however, stood sufficiently high to counter-balance such numerical deficiencies.     Certain, however, of the  tribes of the Diwaniyah and Nasarieh Divisions neverreally made their submission, and attempts .to bring them in resulted in a series of minor operations, bombing by aeroplanes and the like.     io 20-12   100  8.20
    The points  to which attention  has  so far been  directed may be summarisedhere: -    (1) A considerable area on the Lower Euphrates had long been in a state of moreor less successful rebellion to the Turkish Government.    (2) This area had never been fought over  by our armies, and its inhabitants had.           never properly visualised our might.    (3) Certain tribal sheikhs had never really made submission to us.    (4) A further point which must be noted is that the tribes are better armed  than           they had ever been in pre-war days.    At the time when affairs were in this condition, a series of events occurred, whichhad a material effect on the political situation, on the Euphrates :      (1.) Dair-az-Zor was occupied by forces  of  the Arab State  of Syria, and British           officers were made prisoner.   The  surrender of this district to the Arabs           was  interpreted  as  a sign  of  weakness,  and  injuriously affected  our           prestige.     (2) Bolshevik propaganda and tales of their  advance on Persia  had a certain           effect on the minds of the tribesmen.     (3) The establishment of Feisal as  King of Damascus  gave an impetus to the           nationalist party, and afforded them an additional means of propaganda.     (4) The  delay in the drawing up and ratification of the Treaty  of Peace  with           Turkey was  extremely puzzling to the Arab tribesman, who understood           only the simple rule that what had been won by the sword  should be kept           by the sword.  This delay allowed the idea of &quot; self-determination &quot; to be           sedulously propagated, and a  general belief began to spread abroad that           the  British  Government no  longer had  a free hand  in dealing with           Mesopotamia, but were in some  indefinite way under the control of the           League of Nations.     It is not  difficult to see the effect which ideas  of  this kind  could not fail to produce in the  minds of so warlike and excitable a people as the Arab tribes.     When we  also remember  that since the  date of the  armistice  a  considerable reduction had  taken place  in  the numbers of the British troops in Mesopotamia, it will be seen that the tribesmen had some reason,  for considering  that, to (quote the words of an. Arab sheikh, &quot; the arm of the British Government  had grown shorter.&quot; A further factor  in the anti-British movement, to which reference must  be  made, were the  intrigues of Mirza Mahomed Rid ha,  son  of Mirza Mahomed Taqi Shirazi, of Kerbela,  Chief  Mujtahid of the Shia&apos; faith.     The latter, a feeble old man of great age, more than half in his dotage, has little knowledge of affairs outside his religious duties and  obligations, while  the state of seclusion in which he has passed his days has rendered him, like so many of his kind, both credulous  and bigoted to the last degree.     At the same time, his position as Chief Mujtahid has placed  at  his disposal very large  sums of money, which accrue from time to time  in the shape  of religious alms  and oblations.     The son, Mirza Mahomed Ridha, an unscrupulousperson of  little natural ability and of no personal consequence save as the son of his father, has set himself, with the aid of his father&apos;s purse and largely without the  old man&apos;s knowledge, to lead  the anti-British intrigue, doubtless hoping  to attain to such political  eminence as will assure his future  and save him from the obscurity to /which his fathers death will otherwise relegate him.      There can be little doubt  but that personal ambition is  the motive of  Mirza  Mahomed Ridha&apos;s actions.      At the same time,  the prestige of his father&apos;s name has lent  to  the anti-British  movement a  religious character which it would not otherwise have possessed, and  the  effect of  which cannot be ignored.      Fortunately the Arab of the Euphrates has little of the fanatic in his composition,  and the intrigues and appeals of the Mirza have  only borne fruit where the ground.  was, forhnore material reasons, favourable to their propagation.      What then are the objects of the prime movers in the present agitation ?      No  single answer will adequately reply to this question, and  we shall probably  most nearly arrive at a  correct solution if we divide the actors  in the drama into  their several classes,  and  endeavour to attribute to  each of them their  several  motives :-      (1)  I have stated that personal  ambition  is probably  at the root of  Mirza            Mahomed Ridha&apos;s actions.
    (2)  The Sunni official classes, who monopolised  office in the time of the Turks,.           and who have taken a leading part in the anti-British propaganda, desire           to regain the position of domination over the Shias which they occupied           under the old regime.  They know  that they have a practical monopoly           of  education  and  administrative experience,  and  that if  responsible           British statesmen can be  hurried into establishing in Mesopotamia a full-           blown &quot; National Government,&quot; it is by them and  the  members of their           families that  the great majority of posts in the administration  will be           filled.    (3)  A certain number of prominent individuals on the Euphrates, both tribal and           townsmen, are imbued with  the idea  that  by taking  part  in the  anti-           British propaganda they are playing  a  safe game, which, if an Arab           national Government should  be established in Mesopotamia, will render           them personaz gratia, and at worst will  show the  British Government that           they are persons of  consequence, who are  entitled  to be treated  with           respect and consideration.               It is somewhat difficult to follow their line  of reasoning, but this is           the opinion expressed to the writer by one of the shrewdest of  the Hillah           Sheikhs, who may be credited with  a  knowledge  of the characters  and           motive of his own countrymen.    (4)  A few of the leaders on the Euphrates base their opposition to the British on           the ground that we are  infidels.  The number who are actuated by this           consideration is probably small.    (5)  The Arab tribesman is opposed to any form  of control which does not bring           him visible and material benefits.               The tribes of the Hillah division had benefitted under the Turkish Go-           vernment by the construction of the Hindiyah Barrage ; they had benefitted           still  further by  the  construction of  several important canals since the           occupation of  Baghdad.   They realised that their material  prosperity           depended  on  the control  by the British Government  of the irrigation           sources of their lands, and it  is lai gely owing to this  consideration  that           they had been  consistent supporters of the British regime.               It will be interesting to learn if these tribes have  maintained, under           very difficult circumstances, their previous attitude of consistent loyalty to           the British Government.  The tribes of Samawa and Rumeitha had hitherto           benefitted  little from our rule,  and if they had hitherto paid  little in           taxation, they feared that  demands might soon be made on them which.           would accord but little with their inclinations.                It is  more than a coincidence that the rising occurred just when the           land revenue demands were normally due for presentation, and the minds           of  all Arab cultivators were exercised as to the incidence of the revenue           on their own shoulders.    It remains to consider how far a national spirit has been a factor in  the rising.In other words, how far have the tribes now in arms against us been actuated  by  a desire to throw off the British yoke, and establish a National Arab Government ?    In  the view of the  writer, the  political outlook of at least  90 percent, of the tribesmen  of  the  Euphrates is bounded by the  territorial limits of the tribe..  Hiswhole existence is bound  up with his membership of a tribe.    It is fear of the vengeance of his tribe, not dread of the arm  of the  law; which from time immemorial has enabled him to live his life and cultivate his lands,in  thesmall measure of security to which he has attained.    He has lived surrounded by other tribes,  many of them open enemies, othersuncertain friends.    With  changes  in  the course of.  the Euphrates, there has been  a  constantreshuffling of  tribal lands, the stronger constantly  dispossessing  the weaker in the hard struggle  for existence, occasioned by the necessity for the command  over thebest possible  sources of  water  supply for  irrigation.  There are few areas on theEuphrates which  do  not  contain  an Alsace-Lorraine, an  Italia Irredenta,  which  a-turn of  fortune&apos;s wheel may restore to the tribe, which has been, in its own opinion,.wrongly dispossessed.                                                    !.-    The tribesman&apos;s  outlook is strictly parochial:  his neighbour is regarded far moreas an actual or potential enemy than as a fellow member of a single race.    A spirit of nationality may probably be relegated to a  very low seat  among the factors which  have led up to the rising.
    The tribes of the Hillah, Diwaniyah, Shaniiyah and  Nasarieh divisions  could, ata moderate estimate, turn out 60,000 well-armed men.   How  many of  these havelistened  to  the call of  nationality and  come  forth -to sweep  away the weak andscattered detachments of their country&apos;s enemies ?    Before  closing this note it is necessary to say a word on the  subject of  taxation.A certain section of the critics of  the Mesopotamian administration  have attributedthe present rising to the excessive  taxation which they assert has  been levied.  Nofigures  are  available to the writer, but it is a safe assertion  that  the  increase in  the gross amount of taxation levied  under the British regime,  as compared with that oftheir  predecessors, is much less than  the increased value of all agricultural  produceor than the Arab&apos;s capacity to pay.    For the past six years we have been spending very large sums in a country of avery sparse population, and the aggregate wealth per capita  of Mesopotamia must  be high.   Further, it must be borne in mind that the amount of  revenue actually collected in Samawa and Rumeitha areas has been very light.  In Nasarieh. little revenue hashitherto been collected.    The causes of the rising must be sought elsewhere than in excessive taxation.    The writer has endeavoured to indicate the causes which appear to him to havegiven rise  to  the present unrest.  The  opinions which he has expressed are not SO&apos;much the creation of his own mind as the reflection of the ideas of the  sanest andmost level-headed of the leaders of Arab opinion with whom he  has been in almostdaily contact for the past two and a half years, among whom he numbers real friends,and with whom he  has  discussed  frequently and at length the troubles  which were coming to a head when he left Mesopotamia.    These opinions may be briefly summarised :     (1) The Arab tribesman is of a  warlike  and excitable  disposition;  even more           ready to bring out his rifle and dagger than the typical Irishman is to-           brandish his shillelagh; intolerant of any control which does  not visibly           add to his material prosperity ;  ignorant and credulous, his mind  is a rich           soil for the propaganda of  the political intriguer.    (2) The National Party  in Mesopotamia, which is very nearly synonymous with           the S mini official class, have seen their political  ascendency and  material           interests  threatened  by the  British regime.    They  believe that their           interests and their purses will best be served by the creation of what they           are pleased to term a National Arab Government.  .,    (3) The political atmosphere of the world in general, and recent events in and           around Mesopotamia in  particular, have been  peculiarly favourable to the-           spread of a propaganda aimed at the de facto Government of the country..    When  oil of any kind, however inferior, is poured on to smouldering embers, aconflagration inevitably results.       :                                               H. H.  MACDONALD TYLER..
