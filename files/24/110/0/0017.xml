This  document is the property of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government, &quot;      g  SECRET.THE CABINET.THE SITUATION  IN  PEESIA.     MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    I circulate herewith two telegrams from the Military Attache&quot; and the Minister inTeheran respectively,  together with a Minute by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff relative to the suggestion that our forces in Persia should be reinforced.                                                                     .W. S.  C.  ,  THE WAR OFFICE,         Slst July, 1920.   -  Secretary of State,    As you know, I  am very strongly opposed to reinforcing our  Persian  forcesexcept as was the case in North Russia such reinforcement is absolutely necessary to effect  a withdrawal.  This is not the case at present.  I think it is sheer madness for our people (civilians and women and children) to remain on in Teheran.                                                          (Initialed)     H.  W.           From the British Military Attache, Teheran, to the War Office.                                              Despatched  28th July, 1920, 1800.(No. C. 36, cipher.)                                 *        (Received 29th, 0800.)    It is reported by General Champain, who arrived here this morning, that the rebelswith strength estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000 men attacked Menjilon, 25th July,and are &apos;.attempting an enveloping  movement.   They have established position withmountain guns on hill behind Menjilon, and it appears evident from the enterprise andskill displayed that enemy are not merely gang of Baku wastrels  and Persian rebels,but are organized by capable officers and are Russian stiffened by Russian nucleus ofRussian Bolshevik troops.  The position of General Champain is most unsatisfactory.He may ward  off attack, but is not at liberty to assume offensive when suitable opportunity occurs, and thus rid himself of the enemy menace.  It is urged, therefore,under the circumstances  that  he  should  be  either reinforced  by another  brigade and given discretion to undertake offensive  action, subject  of  course to his  not allowinghimself to be cut off, or that our forces in North Persia should withdraw.  Should  thelatter alternative be  followed, the result would be the resignation  of Government,flight of the Shah, and a Persian complete anarchy  pending  establishment of Sovietregime in the  capital.   It would  be essential to evacuate  European population ofTeheran prior to such a withdrawal,  as they would otherwise be left at the mercy notonly of the invaders, but of the local  criminal classes.   Though it is technically  theduty of Persian Government to  carry out  this  task,  there  would be  in  effect nogovernments to undertake it.   In  the  meantime General Champain contemplates  thepossibility in  the near  future of retirement from  Menjilon and Zinjan, and  considersthat unless  the enemy  are  considerably reinforced, he should be  able to check for another two months their advance from Kasvin.  This retirement will leave open mainaccess to Persian Kurdistan via Zinjan, and should Bolsheviks succeed in winning overKurdish tribesmen, who are at present in a state of serious unrest,  they should in time be able to threaten  our lines of  communication.   There seems to be little doubt that soviet is secretly abetting Persian adventure, and  1 am of opinion that decisive actionagainst the so-called Bolsheviks in Gilan would deter  Soviet Russia from lending themforthwith  support, for srie is  not likely  to  come out into the open  in  view of  herundertaking not to take military action against British interests.    Repeated to Norperforce; General  Officer  Commanding, Mespotamia,  who  will inform Civil Commissioner.0162476(B20/346)  100 7/20 H&amp;S, Ltd &quot;8443wcr
                 From Mr. Norman (Teheran) to the Foreign Office.                                             Despatched 28th July, 1920, 9 p.m.(No. 541.)   .                          .               (Received 29th, 11.30 a.m.)     Very urgent.   It is  only to-day, thanks to General Officer Commanding, Norper-force, who has come here from Kasvin to discuss situation with me, I have seen copy of telegram  marked   No.  0177682  which   General  Officer  Commanding-in-Chief,Mesopotamia, despatched to War Office as long ago as 12th July.     In this  telegram it is proposed to reduce force under command of General Cham painfrom six battalions to four, two battalions to be withdrawn being by far the best of thetroops now at his disposal, so that if this plan is  carried out, efficiency of his force willbe diminished even more considerably than its numbers.       .     Telegram further  states that General Cham pain has been  instructed to remain inhis present position till he is seriously threatened, when he is to inform me of elate upto which he will retain them, and when that has arrived fall back on Hamadan.     Military Attache  at  this Legation  has to-day sent to  War  Office  telegramreporting that detachment of Norperforce defending Menjil is being strongly attacked and that  it is necessary to contemplate possibility of withdrawing  these troops toKasvin in order to save them from being cut  off.     Unexpected  degree  of efficiency  displayed  by  attacking  force  shows that it is directed by  Russian  Bolsheviks and even supports belief that it contains some russian troops, thus affording further  evidence that Soviet  Government are  already violatingagreement with His Majesty&apos;s  Government referred to in  your telegram  No.  55 fromSpa.   Withdrawal of our detachment from Menjil would  no doubt  encourage despatchof reinforcements from  Russia in order that  Norperforce may be dislodged from Kasvinand capital occupied, nor could General Champain with greatly weakened force, whichit is proposed  to leave  under his command, resist an advance of this kind even withsuch help as could be given by  troops at the disposal of Persian Government.  Retreatto Hamadan might  thus have to be begun at short notice.     In his telegram above  referred to, Military Attache  has alluded to effects whichthis retreat  would inevitably have on the situation here.     I will not discuss political disaster afresh for  it is (? nevertheless) obvious but will only observe that  whereas these effects  would  be immediate  process of evacuatingEuropeans here would  take long time even if it is possible to do it at  all which, with very limited means  available, is extremely doubtful.     Alternative course of leaving these Europeans here at the mercy of such invadersbeing inadmissible, it will become necessary, if Sir A. Ha.ldane&apos;s proposals are approved,to start at once on preparation of a plan to evacute.     I should therefore be grateful  for early information regarding  decision  reached,and would ask that  in considering question, alternative course which I have several times suggested of increasing General  Cham pain&apos;s force  by another  brigade, so  as toenable him to advance  with confidence and recapture Resht and Enzeli while enemy is relatively weak, may not be forgotten (see especially  my telegram No. 512).     Addressed to Foreign Office, sent to  India No. 541, Bagdad No. 261  for GeneralOfficer Commanding, copy Norperforce.
