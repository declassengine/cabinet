The fearof unemployment also is exercising a steadying influence in some industries.     To-morrow a conference of engineering delegates will discussthe decision of the Industrial Court and on August 12th the minors1delegates will meet to decide upon their course of action. .It ie  not improbable that in each case a strike ballot will be ordered.     There is a de&amp;dlook in the woollen textile industry, the workershaving rejected the employers&apos;offer by a majority of about seven toone.  A strike is not, however, considered likely at present.     Though  the official Labour leaders are concerned about the stateof Ireland and are genuinely anxious to act as mediators, there isplenty of evidence to show that the ordinary British working m&amp;nwould back the Government In any strong action likely to put an end to the disorder.  There is in the Labour ranks a growing resentmentagainst Irishmen.     The declared revolutionaries, MacM&amp;McManus and Inkpin, have succeeded in forming a Communist Party, which already carries in itsinfant frame the seeds of dissolution.  Details of the conference are given.  The Left V/ing of the National Guilds league appears tohave joined the party.  Money for the purpose has been supplied byTheodore Rothstein from Russia and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, now a Sovietsubsidised newspaper, is giving the party the fullest advertisement.
THE C0A1 MIB2RS      Tho International Miners Congress is now sitting; Mr. Frank Hodges has been unanimously elected secretary in succession to Mr. Thomas Ashton; -$early half the delegates are British and their absence from this country has caused a temporary lull in the pressure for  increased wages.      There is little doubt that,  at present,  a majority vote in favour of a strike could  be secured,  but my correspondents are of opinion that if the Press  were to put forward a demand for  a secret and universal  ballot on the  question,  the steadier elements would  assert themselves with surprising results.   An important factor  in the situation is a belief that the  South Wales owners  would  be prepared  to pay the increase  demanded. In this case  the  miners affected  would probably not strike  and&apos;the Miners&apos; Federation of Great  Britain would split.   It  is said,  however,  that a section,of the coal owners  is strongly opposed to  this  course.  The profit on a ton  of coal  raised in South  Wales is stated  by James Winstone to be  about  18s.,  whereas  the loss in the- Midlands  is 2s-  7d.                 k ;i      The  demand for a higher  increase  th^in  &amp;s. per ton has  spread to  Lancashire, where the  miners  are     - - comparatively  indifferent  regarding  the proposed reduction in the  cost of household coal.                ;      Tho feeling  among workers  in  other industries is by no means sympathetic, for they regard the miners as one  of the chief  causes of  the&apos; higji cost of living. The railwaymen are disinclined at present to support a Miners&apos; strike.     nationalization, which was thought to, have beendecently buried,  is showing sighs  of reanimation  under                                               the/
*** $      the stimulus  of  a belief  that  it will provide  the men      with a pension from  the State.           The men  in  South  Wales have suddenly become      exercised about  the  stoefcaof coal.  On August  1st,at a      Joint conference of  representatives of the Dockers&apos; Union,      the National  Union of  Bailwaymen end the Coal  Trimmers&apos;      Union at Cardiff, a  resolution was passed strongly      protesting against &quot;the unnecessary stocking of coal in      this  country, thereby  creating untold hardships for the      men engaged in transport  industry&quot;.  It was further      resolved to submit the matter to the executives of the      railwaymen and transport workers with a request that the      Cabinet be asked to liberate stocks.  On the same day      delegates representing the 27,000 railwaymen in South      Wales and Monmouthshire also protested against the      &quot;unprecedented accumulation of stocks of coal  ... which     are to be used in the near future against the organised     workers&quot; and against tho dismissal of railwaymen and     threatened that if the notices which expire on August 7th     were not withdrawn,  steps  should be taken to call a strike the SNGBJ&amp;aRS          On August 6th a conference of delegates of the     Amalgamated Engineering Union  will meet in London to     consider the refusal of the Industrial  Court to grant the     engineers1  claim.   The Executive is known to be sharply  1     divided and Tom Lfenn  will  have to face  serious oppositionl     though he has  given  great  satisfaction  to the extreme     element by  his incendiary  speeches  in the North during     the week.  My  correspondents state  that there is much     j     discontent among  the  Engineers in Yorkshire  and Lancashirj     In  Coventry,on the other hand,  the  men  are comparatively                                                   steady/
 steady and many say that they would leave the Union if such a course were possible.      Mann&apos;s statement at Newcastle, that the rank and file must take the initiative and must not wait for orders from their executive or officials,  proves that he is not sure of his colleagues.  He said that they must consider how far their fluids would go in  case of a strike,  lockout or blockade. Had they sufficient funds to carry on the struggle  for a month, or would.their wives and families be starved within a week? The engineers ought to acquire sufficient influence in the co-operative Societies to be sure of support from them in the event of their being thrown  out  of employment.  What aivital and irresistible force the  two movements  would prove if they could only Join  hand-in-hand.   In  a rather  weak conclusion  he said that  they should  consider the  matter in all its bearings  before  embarking upon  drastic  measures.      At Rochdale  on July 24th  he  was careful to  say that although he was speaking with  the approval  of  the Amalgamated Engineering  Union,  his utterances regarding  the Engineers&apos; dispute must be considered to  be  unofficial, and  continued:          &quot;I shall  take  care that, without undue  delay,      the requisite  action will be taken and  for my part,      whilst  I am prepared to endorse  constitutional action      so long as-such action meets  requirements,  I will      never hesitate to resort  to  any  other kind of action      that will  enable  us  to  obtain our ends.  Nothing less      than a  minimum of  6. 10. 0.  a week  can be considered      satisfactory for  an  engineer with a family.  .          &quot;I  em a believer in  &apos;direct action1 when  the .      circumstances warrant it.  I  got my first lessons in      direct  action and sabotage from the early chapters of      2xodus*  I am not saying you  ought to resort to sabotage      or direct action j but it would not&apos;worry me  if you did      so, because I am one who will refuse as long as I have      energy,  to accept the dirty  standard of life imposed      on the workers by the master class.          &quot;Young mon, will you be content to live the     hugger-mugger lives your fethers have known?  You     wili not be worthy  if you do.  Let us S)eak^clearly.     Let us follow this up; I will not stand back; I will     be with you in the fight.  We have had fights before     and get out of this slough of despond wo will.   I do     not want to cut anyone&apos;s throat or to throw anyono                                               down/

Those of you who are      I          afraid get out of it vihen tho fight comes.&quot;          I          Tom Mann has for some time engaged in systematic     I     correspondence with the local Lodge leaders and this      j     custom is gaining him considerable support.   It may be    1     assumed that if he can carry his Executive,  a strike of   I     engineers is orobable within a fewwseks,                   ITHE COMMUNIST UNITY CONVENTION          The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has been cackling loudly over the  j     birth of the first United Communist Party in England - so     loudly that cynical readers may suspect the  truth, namely     that it is not a party and not united.  It is true that     during- the week-end a conference of some  154 delegates     representing 230 extremist groups throughout the country     met to form a Communist &quot;Party and elected a  Committee     consisting of George Deer,  0.

A. Puraell failed to secure eleotion.          MacManus was elected chairman 6n  the motion of Inkpin;     a resolution which supported the Soviet system,  the     dictatorship of the proletariat, communism,  and adhesion     to the Third International was carried unanimously.

But  the party is  infected with  the seed of dissolution  from  its birth. It  will wage war  upon the rival Communist party of Sylvia  Pankhurst  and though it  may  succeed in  drawing away some of her  supporters, it will inevitably split asunder when the  leaders  begin  uncommunisticelly to push one another  out  of the limelight.      It is  doubtful whether the Labour Party will accept the  Communist Party&apos;s proffered adhesion: Ur. Ramsey Maodonald and  the  Independent Labour Party,which has a majority  on  the Executive,  are  said to be strongly opposed  to  the Communists.

They have officially circulated the following     resolution:-               &quot;That this Board oppose the proposals remitted           from Bristol Congress, both in regard to affiliation           with the Labour Party, as defined in the resolution           sent in by tho Coventry Society, and the entry into           an alliance with that Party, as recommended in           tno report of the Co-operative Party to Congress,           both these proposals being, in our opinion, contrary           to the conditions under which the movement decided           to seek representation in Parliament and on public           bodies.&quot;           In the meantime tho arrangements for the proposed     fusion are being discussed by representatives of the     three bodies, who met at the offices of the Trade Union     Congress under the chairmanship of llr.  Harry Cosllng on     July  87th.          This opposition of the Directors may not affect     the secret arrangement under which the Co-operatives are     to provide strikers with food during the coming strikes.          Meanwhile the Co-operative Societies are in danger     of a strike on the part of their own employees who are     very much dissatisfied with tho last award.THE &quot;NO RENT&quot; SERIES          The National Conference of the Scottish Labour     Rousing Association has settled on August 23rd es the day     for the 24  hours1  strike  against the Rent Act.  It further     resolved to  recommend tenants to pay no rent until the  Sf     is withdrawn,  except in cases  where no  increase in rent     is demanded.

All    members are pledged to pay no increased rent.  The Scottish    Mine Workers1 Union has unanimously decided to support the    84 hours&apos; strike.         Sections of Labour in South Wales are organising opposition    to the Kent Act.THE &quot;HINDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; MOVEMENT         7et another manifesto has been issued by the National    &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee; it is signed by A.  A. Purcell,    H. Skinner, Ben Turner, R. C. Railhead and R. Williams, who    wore members of the Labour delegation to Russia.   The manifesto    is an incitement to direct action, as the signatories &quot;ha\*e    been compelled to realise that no form of Parliamentary action    will induce the British Government to give up its policy of    trying to strangle, the Soviet regime.&quot;  They, therefore, appeal    to men and women trade unionists to &quot;decide in favour of direct    action as the,only way out of the impasse.&quot;         It is believed that the Committee recently received money    frora-Nogin of the Russian Trading Delegation,         An article by Robert Doll in the &quot;Forward&quot; of July 31st    frankly admits and condemns the tyranny of the Communists in    Moscow which he calls &quot;The Perversion of the Russian Revolution&quot;,    but characteristically he lays the blame on the Entente for    their intervention.MR. MALONB. M.P..         In the current issue of yarious Labour papers Mr. Mslone    outlines his reasons for Joining the Communist Party:              &quot;I have taken this Action because I appreciate         that the Parliamentary machinery and the Parliamentary         democracy of this country are arrant humbug.  Only a         fundamental change of our present economic and social         systems can improve the-conditions of the working         classes, who constitute the majority of the  people...                                                       &quot;The/
      &quot;The working-classes are blinded by the  hopes that a so-called Labour Government,  working through this effete machine,  will alter and  better conditions. A Labour Government would inherit  tho capitalist machine and be at the mere:.;  of it, i.e.,  it could do nothing fundamental against  the capitalist interests and tho  bureauoracy.   The office-seeking elements of the Labour Party will be  as conservative es  their bourgeois predecessors.   Saddled with  the Monarchy, the Court and the  Aristocracy,  the  Labour  Party will follow the lead of all  bourgeois  parties,  selling honours as well as honour.   They  (i.e.,  the official leaders) have already betrayed Ireland.   The  masses  must clearly understand that the two irreconcilable  forces to-day are International Communism and  Cosmopolitan Capitalism ...      &quot;I  entered Parliament in  the hopes  of assisting to better the social conditions.   I have  seen from the inside the   futility  of  Parliamentary  action  so far as fundamentals are  concerned.  Parliamentary  work end elections must only be  used for  carrying out  an intensive revolutionary propaganda.  My own opinion  as  regards Parliamentary action is that  results could be obtained quicker by a complete boycott,  and at elections that  the boycott of the polling- booths should be  advocated,  in  addition,  of course,  to Communist  propaganda.   If you are out to destroy the system,  you cannot begin with  taking the oath  of allegiance to the symbol of  that very system.   The People&apos;s Army must have  its  own flag, and not deceitfully salute  the flag of the enemy as e preparation for striking it.  But  at the same  time  there are many who bolieve that Parliament oan&apos; still be used for propaganda and other purposes  ...      &quot;If  I leave Parliament  it will be to continue  thework with  the revolutionary Communist Party outside, and should I return, I trust it will only be with theBed Guards at the time of the Revolution, which  I see is approaching.      &quot;Only the social revolution oan  begin to  makeLiberty, Equality, and Fraternity realities, and not mereelection cries of the Parliomentary hypoorisy.&quot;SINK PSIN IH GREAT BRITAIN     Beyond the ordinary meetings there has been littleactivity in London Sinn ye in circles.  Propaganda toincrease branch membership and to raise money for the Irishrailwaymen and dockers has been carried on.     On August 1st a &quot;Hands off Ireland&quot; meeting convenedby the local Independent Labour Party was held at liverpool and was attended by about 2,500 people, the majority ofwhom were Irish or foreign.  Violent speeches were made&quot;&apos;
 by J,  R.  Wilson,  tho  Australian  deportee,and  Sean MoLoughlan,   The  latter said:-           &quot;For  God&apos;s  sake* wake  up,   Can&apos;t you  see what     an opportunity you have?  Don&apos;t  be deluded  into     thinking that a  revolution  can be brought  about     without  bloodshed.   It  canft.   If a  revolution comes     in this  country  it will be  worse than any  revolution     that has ever taken place in the history of the world.     It will  be a bloody revolution in every  sense of  the     word,  far  bloodier than it  would have been  if it  had     come sooner.  I  say this with every  sense  of     responsibility;  it is your  own fault because when     the  great  war was  over  you  did a very foolish thing     those of you who took any part in it.  you handed     back your  rifles and your revolvers  instead of taking     them home  with you,  and thereby  having them in your     possession,  the  most effective weapon and  indeed     the  only weapon  for bringing about a successful     revolution.&quot;     some 2,000 people  attended  a meeting of  the Irish-Self-Determination Laa^ue at Middlesbrough on August 1st. Arthur Griffith,  Sean Kilroy and J. 0&apos;Mahoney missed their train  connection  and  their places were taken by local speakers.  Catholic clergy were  on the platform  and a  letter was read  from the  Bishop  of Middlesbrough, in which he stated  that he  regarded  the invitation to attend the meeting as a compliment.     My Glasgow correspondent states  that many  Sinn Feiners who went  to Ireland for  their holidays have not  returned to Scotland  so far,  end  others who  were  at coast resorts have been told to  hold  themselves in  readiness for active service. Another batch of  Sinn Feiners is stated to have  gone to Ireland this  week-end.  Generally speaking the support of Sinn Fein clubs in Scotland for  the Republican forces oonsistfl )f moral and  financial backing,  $,k good  deal of money is obtained from subscriptions and concerts,  the greaterpart of which goes to Ireland,    The activity of  Sinn Feinduring  the week has been mainly confined to propaganda work.My correspondent states that Orangemen in Glasgow havereceived calling up notices.                                          IRELAND/
IRSLAHD  i          There has been no  Improvement  in the  state  of Ireland  &apos;     during the week;  the condition in Munster  is practically  tha     of civil  war.   Of the 287 outrages  known to the  police, 231     were directly  attributable to  Sinn  Fein arid 6 wore of an     agrarian  nature.   There  were 34  cases of highway robbery, 24     raids for arms and, 39 cases of flagrant intimidation.          Attacks on troops  show an increase and the&apos;relations     between troops end the ccivil population in  some  parts are     strained.   Boycotting has ocourred  in a few cases  but this     action has been futile as necessary provisions have been     requisitioned.          Information  has been received  from d Source believed to     be reliable that  the campaign of murder directed against the!     police is  to be pursued  even more relentlessly this month inI     the  hope  of breaking up  the force.  The military,  it is     considered, will  then be  of little use.  Attacks on police     barracks  are believed to  have cost  the rebels dearly and are     to be  partially abandoned in favour of attacks on patrols.         The  Curfew order in  Cork is having considerable effect,     An important capture  has  taken plaoe  in this  area.  Thomas  I    Bales,  tho  Commandant of  the 3rd Cork Brigade, has been capt     together with  his Brigade  Quartermaster, Patrick Hart.  The     arrest  of  these two firebrands will have an  excellent effectj         Brigadier  General Lucas, who was kidnapped  some time ag    made his escape on Friday  morning and took refuge  in Pallas j    Royal  Irish Constabulary  barracks, Co. Limerick.  On his way I    from Palias to  Tipperary  his escort was ambushed at Oola, arl    two soldiers were shot dead.  It is believed  the Sinn Feinexl    suffered some casualties.                                   j         Papers seized during  the week disclose the expenses of                                                   I   &quot;Dail/

A large part of the money raised in Americaseems to have disappeared and there is greet discontent anddistrust of de Valera.  About  240,000 has been raised inIreland, practically half of this from the province of Munster.     &quot;Old Ireland&quot;, &quot;Young Ireland&quot; and &quot;The ?fetchword ofLabour&quot; have appeared as usual.  &quot;Old Ireland&quot; contains anattack on some of the Roman Catholic Rierarch who are opposedto Sinn Fein, and an appeal to them to recognise &quot;Bail 3ireann&apos;T     The railway position remains unchanged.
