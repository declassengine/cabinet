     SECRET.CP.  ;i79-[   \*\                  THE  CABINET.^Allo^     SITUATION  IN  MESOPOTAMIA.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I  circulate herewith copies of telegrams  from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad,    121on the serious situation in that country.                                                3                                                                     W. S. C.    1858&quot;  THE WAR OFFICE,           20th August, 1920.     FROM  CIVIL  COMMISSIONER,  BAGHDAD, TO  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.(No. 9751.)            Baghdad, 13th-August, 1920; received 0900, 14th August.     Situation has (? developed)  unfavourably during past 48  hours.  Attempt wasmade on 11th to ambush Assistant Political Officer Telefar (? who was), parleying withShammar, supported by three squadrons of cavalry.   Appears to me that  tribesmentreacherous, opened fire on cavalry escort, who returned fire with good results.     2. Attempt was made on 12th to (? ambush) Political Officer  Arbil on his way to(? Rowanduz) to meet Seyyid Tahar.  Political Officer was accompanied by levy officer and got away with assistance of tribal escort,  but he considers attempt was probablyfirst move in preconcerted revolutionary scheme,  owing to (? stubborn) spirit of disorderamong tribes.     3&apos;.  it is reported that Lieut.-Colonel Leachman was (sic) assassinated and killed on12th August near Follujah.     4. It has become necessary to withdraw assistant political officer from Zalatsikar.As a result of this step it is,&apos; 1 fear,  inevitable that assistant  political officers at Haiand  Shalrah will also be  forced to leave, and this in turn will re-act unfavourably on situations both on Tigris and Euphrates.     5, At present time there is (no ,?) sign of disturbances in Sulaimaniyah Divisionitself, but the country on Persian side  of frontier is  greatly disturbed, and it  is not improbable that it will spread across  border as soon as it is realized that we are unableto detach forces in this direction.     6.  Situation at Samawah also threatening.     7. Political Officer, Baqubah, has been compelled to evacuate that place as a resultof tribal rising which (? column)  was  not successful  in  suppressing, and it must beassumed that Shahrabas and  Khani (?......)n will shortly follow  suit, as there are notroops there and our communications  with Persia are thus  severed.     8. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is doubtless addressing (corrupt group)military aspect; I need only say that I think we must now (? act) on assumption thatdisorder will (? shortly) become general, and we  must be  prepared for further  with-withdrawals.   (Corrupt  group)  once   civil  administration   has  been  thus  compelledprecipitately to evacuate a  district, it will be difficult if  not  impossible  to  restore itexcept by  military operations in  the  district affected, and  there  is no  immediate prospect (? of  this)  and as  civil revenue cannot afford to maintain employees for any length of time who are not doing productive work.   I am commencing to  send backto India considerable numbers of employees on civil departmental (?duty), particularlyIrrigation Works Post and (? Telegraphs).                       Baghdad, 18th August,  1920;  received 0900, 19th August.     My  telegram  of 13th August, No. 9751.   I regret to have to report furtherunfavourable developments.  Refugees&apos; camp at Baqubah has been attacked.   Baqubahitself has been  sacked b)^ riffraff of  town, &quot;assisted by (? tribesmen) (?  full stop)Shahraban and Qizil Robat has (sic) been  sacked and a political officer and officerThis  document is the property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.
captured or killed.   At  Kaniquim,  Government offices  and house of a political officerhas (sic) been burnt, and a political officer,  with his  wife and family, have been forcedto take refuge at railhead.  A  political officer at Miutuwah  is in his house,  but nolonger in authority.  Our detachments at Qarsa and at Quragha (the latter being thejunction of Kifri line with main  line from  Baghdad  to the (?  Persian) frontier) aresurrounded, and various  bridges have been burnt.   Our (? detachments)  at (? Kifri)and (? Kirkuk) are  thus  (? cut  off) and it (? will  not be:  possible to (corrupt group)extricate (? them) for some considerable time to come.    Our  detachments at Eamadiand Fallujah are cut off from Baghdad.     Situation  is obscure owing to absence  of telegraph(?  ic) communication by  landwire  or wireless, but there is  little (? doubt) that division is in an  uproar.  (?The)evacuation of Mosul Villayet  may, in my opinion, shortly  be forced  upon us.   With-drawal of force  from that  place  is a most difficult  operation,  but  it  may  not beimpossible of accomplishment without serious (? losses) if sufficient forces can be (? made)(corrupt group) capable of protecting (? the line) from Baghdad to Shargat, either fromfresh troops now arriving or by withdrawals from Bamadi and possibly Kirkuk.  If we(? withdraw from) Kirkuk the whole of Kurdistan will of course relapse into anarchy.Revolutionary movement has for some time past ceased to have any political  aspectand  has become entirely (? anarchic).   No  one appears more  anxious (to)  thanleading Kujtahids and  many of the leading people of  (? Baghdad) to put an end todisturbances  which  they themselves have created,  but it  is not  within  their power-to do so.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are in a better position than we on the spot to judge the political effect of movements indicated above  on  British interests (? in the) middle east (? full stop) I  can  (? only)  repeat that (? whether we) are to  go or to stay,&quot; moretroops are required  (? than those now) in country or on  their way.   (? That  being so)would (?  urge)  whatever  can  be  done to despatch troops be done (? forthwith),  thatwe this month told  what is the  most His Majesty&apos;s Government can do for us, and  thatGeneral Officer Commanding-in-Chief be given authority to  frame  his plans includingwithdrawal of all troops from Persia accordingly.     Eastern Committee  are presumably aware that a division  now  arriving from Indiacontains no British  battalions, and you are aware  from  my previous telegram that weare relying more  than is either right  or expedient upon Indian battalions to maintain(? these) I am shipping downstream  all women and  children  belonging  to  OfficerCommanding (? omission)-s of civil administration as soon  as possible (corrupt group)intimate that am repatriating certain departmental personnel (? full stop).     Foregoing telegram has been  seen by  General Officer  Commanding-in-Chief  whohas no comment to  make.
