                    PERSIA,          It  is reported that In the fighting with theBolsheviks on the Janga-li front (NortbA/est Persia) theBritish.oocupied Yuzbashi Chai on the main road from Kasvinto kenjil, while the Cossacks captured  80 prisoners and sixmachine  guns at Peitohinar.   The prisoners included twoRussian  officers.   Thence they pushed  on to Menjil wherethey:captured prisoners and one 4.7 gun and sixteen machineg-unSi    The  energy is now retiring bn Resht.                  MESOPOTAMIA.          The situation in Mesopotamia is. still grave.Blockhouses  have been constructed at hoth. ends of the bagadad-Hillah railway.   Baghdad is quiet and no attack hasbeen made on the city so far.         Reinforcements are still being:sent from India andit is hoped  that 3 British battalions will be despatchedforthwith.         The officers and crew of H.M.S. &quot;OLIO&quot; have proceeded to man some gunboats on the Tigris.                    FBILAND.         No  further information has been received of theprogress  of  the Uorpat negotiations.                 SOVIET  RUSSIA.         :i\ change has taken place in the Polish situation.Under French, direction.;.-the Poles have  counter attaoked^andhave driven  the Soviet array back a considerable distance.Brest Litoisk is threatened if not actually captured and about 30,000 Bolsheviks are stated to be surrounded.   Onthe Vistula  there have been some lodal Bolshevik attacks,but these have slight importance in view of the generalBolshevik repulse and also of the fact that Posen canshortly put  HO,000 trained men into the field.   Trouble isstill experienced with regard to the  transit of munitions  to poland through Danzig.   T^e Polish Peace Delegates arrivedat the Russian outmosts on August 14th and proceeded toMinsk.   Bolshevik W/T states that negotiations werecommenced at 7 p.7\  August 17th.    The Polish Government have,however, received no oommunication&apos; from their Delegation,which tends  to prove that the Bolsheviks are adopting thesame tactics as the--7 did&quot;with the Georgian Delegation to moscow, that is, insisting that the Delegation should have full plenipotentiary powers and then withholding allcommunication from and to the Government concerned until anagreement had been signed.         The French Government states that if the Soviet willguarantee Poland a just peace, with full political indepen-dence and. ethnographical&apos; integrity, it will use its influence to urge Poland to accept,   .         No  negotiations have yet been commenced with, theSoviet Trade delegation in London.BALTIC
                    MLTIO.Lithuania^ .  The Baltic Conference at Riga makes slow progress, it is hampered&quot;by the attitude of the Polish ChiefDelegate towards-Lithuania.   Recent events have apparentlynot modified Polish policy and there is danger of an attempt by the Poles in their present operations to re-occupy Vilna,givinp: strategical necessity as .an excuse.                  SOOTH RUSSIA..         An important agreement has been reached between general Grange?, and the Don, FubanA Terek and AstrakhanCossacks in which : range! is recognised as Supreme commander of all anti-Bolshevik forces, but the Cossacks retain their independence-   Tne Bolsheviks have moved reinforcements from the S.E. Polish front and strong attacks are developingon the Dnieper and Oriekhov fronts;  up to the present, theadvantage rests with Wrangel.   Anti-Bolshevik risings are reported in the Don and Kuban districts.   V/rangellsadministration of the newly acquired territory is good andthe peasants are daily gaining more confidence in him.         The British Cabinet have decided that no medicalsupplies, from whatever source, ban be sent to general wrangel .Azerbaijan.         The report by the Bolshevik Fission at Tiflis- thatall prisoners had been removed to a private house outsidethe town has not so far been confirmed.Armenia.         The Amenian Government as preliminary to finalnegotiations at Erivan ^or peace with the Soviet Governmenthave agreed to the temporary occupation by Bolshevik troops of Kartiaogh, Sangezur and all Nakhitchevan south ofShaitakhti.   Legrand, the Bolshevik Commissar, has informed the Armenian Government that Soviet troops have advanced toTabriz.   This arrangement is tantamount to an unfriendly,act against Great Britain, by opening a road for the Bolsheviksto Turkey and North Persia,                     GERMANY.         It is reported that deliveries of coal to theEntente in the quantities agreed upon at Spa are proceedingsmoothly.         Polish armed bands have crossed the plebiscitefrontier in Upper Silesia in various plaoes and carried outraids, and there have been collisions between them andGerman troops.   French plebiscite troops are not taking any active steps to prevent t^ese raids.                     HUNGARY.        -It is believed that the Hungarian Parliament &apos;will not ratify the Peace Treaty for&quot;at least another twomonths, and that the ratification, when it does take plaoe,will lead to the fall of the Ministry.POLAND
                   POLAND.         The Polish Peace Delegation, which is headed by oneof the leadens of the Peasant Party and includes a prominentSocialist, will, it is considered, ensure proper consideration and fulfilment of the armistice and peace proposals of theSoviet Government.  , It is regarded as t^e most conciliatorydelegation which could have -be on sent.         Since the Polish counter-offensive whioh began onAugust 16th the military situation has been completelyreversed.   The Soviet army, whioh had advanced almost to thegates of Warsaw, has been thrown back in disorder behind theNAREW and the BUG, witTr the loss of ,many thousands ofprisoners.   The pursuit is continuing.                   DANTZIG.         Sir R, Tower, the Allied High Commissioner, has sent a letter to the Polish Commissioner at Posen saying that he cannot allow shins carrying munitions of war for Poland toenter Danzig, as otherwise serious riots cannot be averted-                   ALBANIA.

The Chamber has ratified the Austrian and BulgarianPeace Treaties.                   ARABIA.         ?ing Hussein is to be pressed, to sign the turkish treaty, in view of the effect his abstention might have onthe&quot; Pan-Islamic movement.                SYRIA AND PALESTINE.         The Italian Government have promised to give Feisaland his companions every facility for&quot;their journey to____________Europe.Northern Syria and Cilicia.   Latest information from Cilicia &apos;shows continued improvement *-n the French military position.The Operations at the end of July succeeded in relieving.Tarsus as well as Mersina.         Vice Admiral de Bon, Commanding the eastern mediterranean Squadron, has left Constantinople for Alexan-dretta.                      PRANCE.         J&apos;&quot;uch indignation has been caused in France by theaction of Sir Reginald To^er, the Allied High commissioner at Danzig, in prohibiting- the landing at that port of Frenchmunitions
munitions for Poland,   It should be frorno in mind that sir Reginald Tower is acting under the League of Nations-,and not under orders,.from the British Government,                     SPAIN.Morocco.   Operations against Sheshouan vd.ll  not becontinued until the autumn, when French co-operation isexpected to develop.
