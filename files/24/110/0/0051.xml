JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTYTS  GOVERNMENT/SECRETINCREASE IN WORKMEN&apos;S PARES,Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Minister               oi Transport o     The Report of the Rates Advisory Committee on the interim revision of ordinary passenger fares, season tickets, and workmen^s fares, was submitted to a meetingof the, Cabinet held on the 2TOi July, 1920*   Therecommendation of the Committee with regard to the intro-duction of increased charges on ordinary tickets andseason tickets as from 6th August was approved^     As regards workmen^ tickets, the recommendationsof the Committee that workmen1a fares should be increasedwas accepted in principle, hut having regard to the widediscrepancies at present existing in districts and thepossibility of unfairness resulting from the applicationof a uniform increase, it was decided that I should examinethe Committeets proposals and submit to the Cabinet a fullscheme for increased workmen1^ fares     The scale recommended by the Rates Advisory Committeewas as under$-Por any distance aot exceeding 2 miles 3d.for Return Journey*For distance between 2 and 2^ miles 3^d    w     w     it &quot;      n       n    2&amp; and 2% miles 4d. M                     2% and 3 mile 4^d..  n                     5  and 3^ miles 5d.  n                     3^ and p$3 miles 5&amp;. M                     3^ and 4 miles 6d4tittnttitnttnifitnttttttttttttttttittitittFor distance over 4 miles - 3d, for the first 4 miles and         for every half-mile over 4 milesc     It will be seen that under the proposed achemethe return workmen*s fare for a journey of 4 miles each way ,would be 6d. and that compares with an ordinary returnticket fare of l/2d* and further, for a distance of 8 miles                                              /each
Aam     each way,  the workmen1s return fare would be  lOcL  as     against ?in ordinary return fare of 2/4,    There  can be     no doubt therefore that the scale in itself ia a very     fair one and its relation to ordinary fares favourable     for the worker.    The Advisory Committee, however,     recognise  that a number of workmen&apos;s fares had been fixed     on an exceptionally low basis and might  produce  hardship.     They recommend therefore that in no case should the increase     exceed 200  over the existing fares.  Even this  limitation     might produce hardship and I have analysed the workmen5s     fares in operation over a very large proportion of  the Country.&apos;               The number of fares which would have been affected     by the 200$ limitation of the Committee  would be 1,050,  and     even with this limitation a number of fares would have been     increased by a considerable sum of money per week.   The     following table shows the number of fares affected if the     limitations wore, fixed at varying amounts from 4/-  per week     increase down to 2/6 per week increase as well as limited by     the 200$:-                                                     &apos;                                                    Additional                                        No. of    :  increase                                        fares afiect- affected by  Total                                        ed by lim*  200$ limit-                                        itatlon.    at ion *_  _wincrease to exceed 200$                      -          -        1050    w     11   11    4/- per week or 200$    1234         798      2082    w     &quot;   &quot;    3/6  &quot;    &quot;  &quot;   &quot;      1957         625      2582    &quot;     &quot;   &quot;    3/-  &quot;    &quot;  &quot;   w      2791         561      3352    &quot;     &quot;   &quot;    2/6  &quot;    11  11   &quot;      4154         401      4555               It will be seen that to  limit the fares by     placing a limit of 4/- per week  as  a maximum increase as     well as a limit of 200$.. 2082 fares would be affected,     whereas if the limit was drawn as  low as 2/6 per week     4,555 would be affected^
          I am of opinion that it would not he wise to imposeIncreases on fares as high as 4/- per week, but I thinkunder the circumstances, a limitation that no fare should!be increased by more than 200$ or 3/- per week is a fairone, and bjr that moans we are not asking the working manto bear a greater share in the cost of transportation thanthe expense of the service nor than his ability to pay would justify.          If this condition is accepted.2,791 would be limited by the amount of 3/- per weok, and there would be 561 limited by the 200$.  The figures would have to be slightlyincreased in respect of the Companies whose returns havenot yet been received, but they give a sufficient indicationas to the general effect of the limitations.  It is notpossible without very considerable labour and investigation to translate these fares into an annual money value, but an examination of the detailed list shews that a considerablenumber of the fares are more or less obsolete, and are usedto a very small, if any, extent.
