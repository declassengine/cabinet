Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.    I circulate tho following note, which has been supplied to ine by the Departmentof the India Office concerned.    1. No authoritative statement as to the cause of  the  outbreak has as yet beenmade (e.g., the Prime  Minister  in  the  House of Commons on 22nd July:  &quot;I reallydo not know  what the causes of  the  outbreak are&quot;); but, perhaps as a result ofColonel Lawrence&apos;s letters to the Times and other papers,  the general opinion seemsto be that we are fighting against Nationalists who are demanding only a form ofGovernment that shall be reasonably independent and  British-advised.    2. The War Office in their letter to the India Office  of  22nd July (circulated tothe Cabinet under&quot;Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memorandum CP. 1696) appeared tosuggest, firstly, that the cause of  the  outbreak was local, and, secondly, that  it wasone of which the local political authorities ought to have given earlier warning.    The India Office has hitherto  hesitated to express an opinion.   It is the object ofthis Memorandum to suggest that the cause of  the outbreak is to  be sought outsideMesopotamia ; and that we can. only  hope to define  it if  we employ  a more  highlycentralised system of intelligence which  will co-ordinate  data  collected in  widelyscattered  fields.    3. The following are the more important facts leading up to the outbreak:     (1) In February  1920  both Sir A. T. Wilson and  Miss Beil  were satisfied withthe general  political outlook  in  Mesopotamia.   The  recently instituted DivisionalCouncils appeared to  be satisfying the  political appetites of the great majority of  the production-Arab  party.   The Civil Commissioner was  &quot;sure that we are on the right  lines.&quot;It is to be remembered that at this time  the influence of those baghdad is, who had served with the  Sharifian troops in Syria and had either returned to Baghdad or werein active correspondence with their compatriots, was comparatively small.    (2) By the end of March, as the result partly of our withdrawals on the Euphrates,partly of the growing  influence of these baghdad is, the Civil Commissioner was forcedto the conclusion that a broader measure  of self-government must be accorded, andhe  proceeded to establish a Committee to  advise him as to the future Constitution.It was still his considered opinion, in which he  had the support of the Committee, and apparently also of Miss Bell, that the decisions of  the Committee should  be imposedupon Mesopotamia by the act.of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government; that if they were  soimposed  they would be accepted, but that if the people were consulted endless troublewould arise:     (3) In May petitions were signed by several of the leading clergy and Shaikhs onthe Euphrates and were  addressed to Emir Abdullah  inviting him to come as king to Iraq.   Commenting  on  these,  the  Political Officer  at  Hillah,wrote to the civil commissioner that &quot; trouble was to be  expected if a favourable answer were sent fromthe Hejaz.&quot;   The  outbreak  coincided with the  date  on which a  reply  might beexpected to have been received.    (4) On 24th June the notables of the  Diwaniyah district, with seven exceptionsonly,  presented a document  to  the civil  authorities reaffirming their petition of  theyear previous, in which they requested that Mesopotamia should remain  under  the care of Great Britain as Mandatory Power.    (5) On the 2nd July a recalcitrant Shaikh was arrested at Rumaitha, a town  inthe same division, and was rescued by his tribesmen.  The rising was at first reportedto be local,  but the situation rapidly deteriorated,  and to-day  (12th August)  theposition is that the civil divisions of Shamiyah  and Diwaniyah have been evacuated ;the Political Officer and garrison at Kufah (6  niiles from Nejof) are beleaguered ;  our      10   2095    100  8.20E. S. M.ALLNote on  the  Causes of  the  Outbreak in Mesopotamia.M^T^AiT^V^^^^&quot; - fflI1 ilWufflililflliKi H III   iPi t\ IHKMIII I&apos;I O (&apos;AlltH1iriTMrtlTfcflfrwi&apos;lilMhillll
military forces on the lower  Euphrates have  been concentrated at Hillah ;  the tribesbetween  Hillah and Baghdad are reported to be restless;  trouble lias broken out inPersian Kurdistan  and. spread to  the Sulaiinauiyah division; and the railway  very-close  to  Baghbah,  in  what should have  been a very quiet non-tribal  agricultural.district, has been cut.    4. Sir A. T. Wilson, asked to define the causes of the outbreak, has been  able toindicate the reasons for its spreading, and. to  characterise its most important features.He has pointed out  how our apparent military weakness emboldened the disaffectedto make a trial of strength, and how, having been unexpectedly successful  in theirinitial attempts, they have succeeded  in spreading  rebellion.  He points out how the tribes hope for a period of  anarchy, in which  each tribe  doubtless expects  to masterhis neighbour, while the clergy in the holy cities hope  for the establishment  of atheocracy.   Peelings appear to be bitterly anti-European, and the aim of our  enemiesis no less than to  drive us into the sea.    But Sir A. T. Wilson, though  able to describe the growth and character of themovement, and to point out that  it is  helped from outside, is, no less than the  WarOffice, unable to state who the real leaders of  the disaffected are.    5. We  have, therefore, to recognise  that we are fighting against an unknownenemy.  We have  the following further data  to  enable us to realise who and where he is:     (a) It has long been recognised that the  Arab party can be roughly divided into two sections :  (1) the sane extremists, who desire  Arab independence under british control;  and (2)  the ultra-extremists, who desire to see the abolition of  Europeancontrol of all sorts throughout the East.    (6) These ultra-extremists command the sympathy of  all persons working against great  Britain,  e.g.,  the Bolsheviks, the  Indian anarchists,  and  the Kemalists.Mustapha  Kemal  is now  openly Bolshevik.  There  is  reason  to suspect that therepresentatives of the  Standard Oil  in Baghdad have given active  support to thisparty.   This is not the  place  to  argue whether some or all  these  movements areindependent or are inspired by a  single directing centre; but whether independentmovements  or separate  manifestations of a single  conspiracy,  they  are  at leastallied.    ,(c) In Notes  on the Middle East (published by the Arab Bureau, Cairo, dated 5thJune, page 113), in commenting on Arab opinion at Damascus on the failure  of ArabBeduin raids,  Palestine,  in May,  the  Syrian  correspondent  has  written :-&quot; AtDamascus the failure of the raids was recognised, and publicly condemned  them aspremature and unfortunate.&quot;   This shows  that  the anti-European party was strong in syria.    (d)  Feisal. who  represents  the pro-British  extremists,  Avas,  even  in Syria,restricted to the powers of a constitutional monarch, and was continually pressed  byhis extremists.   &quot; The Emir Feisal appears already to be shorn  of much of his power and must bitterly regret the day when  his word was law &quot; (Notes on the middle east,  VoL 4, page 115).    (e) In the G.O.C.&apos;s telegram of 6th August he speaks of the leaders of  the rebels&quot;issuing communiques &quot; and also of  their stating that they consider prisoners &quot; as asacred trust.&quot;   Both the publication  of communiques and  the  sentiment  expressedare absolutely un-Arab, and suggest- at  once  that there  is either a European or atleast a European-trained Oriental directing the outbreak.    The  conclusion seems inevitable that the  centre of trouble is outside Meso-potamia ; even as in 1912 Sir Charles Cleveland  stated that  the centre of  trouble inIndia  was outside  India.   It is  suggested that this  centre is in Rome or America.Moscow and Berlin have sub-offices ;  but probably neither of these is the centre.    6. If this conclusion is  correct, then       (i) Instead of the War Office looking to Mesopotamia, Mesopotamia  should be           looking to  the War Office for assistance;  and the  Foreign Office, India            Office and War  Office Intelligence Branches should combine to  seek the           focus of this conspiracy.      (ii) We must  recognise that we are fighting in Mesopotamia not a constitutional            question as to the future, government  of. Mesopotamia, but for the  very            existence of civilisation in the  Middle East.   If we  are  driven out,  only-           anarchy can supervene.
                                         9                                         0     (iii) The only means whereby we can combat the ultra-extremists is  by securing           the support of the pro-British nationalists.   Those must be  organised           under one head.   There are two  possible heads, Feisal and Saiyab Talib.           Sir A. T. Wilson alternatively supports  either.   His earlier  telegrams           tended to show that Saiyab Talib  was the only man.  Later he  suggested           Feisal, and  in that telegram stated that there was no local  candidate           strong enough to command a following.  The inference to be  drawn from           his most recent telegram is that on the whole Saiyib Talib may  prove the           Letter man.  The events  of the next few  days may show which horse  we           should back.  Possibly we may run both, Saiyab  Talib  as  Governor  of           Basrah and Feisal as Arab &quot; king&apos;&quot; at Baghdad.     For the moment it would seem that all energies should be directed on (a) finding the focus  of the  conspiracy,  (b) crushing the focus  when  discovered, and (c) while taking all  military measures necessary to restore order, on  preparing a nationalist party which will assist in the campaign against anarchy  and be ready to  assume thegovernment, under British advice, as soon as security is re-established.       Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 3rd February 1920.    (R.)  1485.  Please refer to my telegrams of -0th November, 27th December,18th January, regarding political  situation in Mesopotamia.  Also  my  telegram  of29th January,  regarding  Dair-ez-Zor.   Miss Bell,  who for some months  has beenround  entering into friendly  relations  with some  of more advanced politicians  in baghdad, and  thus has exceptional  facilities of  ascertaining  the  trend  of  publicopinion,  is of opinion that there  are  indications  of  a  general  increase in friendlyfeeling in Baghdad itself, and  that the political attitude of  the people who count mustbe regarded as  encouraging.   The current news from Syria and  Turkey does us goodby (? contrast).    This appreciation of  the  situation, with which the Political Officer of  Baghdadconcurs,  bears out general trend of my telegrams during past three months, and lendspoint  to my  belief that we are working on a right line, and that we need fear  no serious setback  provided the civil administration remains, as at present, in close touchwith leading people and retains its ability to act  quickly in legislative  and admini-strative matters affecting public welfare of populace, and  public confidence  as our administration at present enjoys locally, is to be ascribed largely to its (? accessibility),and to its power  to take prompt  action,  to give  administrative effect  to redress  ofgrievances and  to minute defects in mechanism.    In this connection 1 would remind  His  Majesty&apos;s Government that I  have not yet received orders on my Despatch of 13th July regarding Turkish notes, nor have I yet received the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government  regarding land settlement questionwhich was referred home in my Despatch of 3rd July.    I quote these pronunciations in no spirit of criticism, but simply to emphasise the fact  that  our administration will be  acceptable largely  in proportion  to  itsability to give prompt effect to measures of  this sort which meet the popular need  or which  are desired to remedy disabilities  or disadvantages from  which  particularclasses are suffering.  I shall doubtless before long be  called upon  to submit  viewsupon  the proposals contained  in Treasury  letter of 17th December.&apos; I trust, when this question is dealt with,  due weight will be given to the above considerations.          Telegram from Civil Commissioneri Baghdad, dated 8th May 1920.    (R.)  5559.  Your  telegram of 4th May.  It  will be  seen  from  my  previoustelegrams that first portion of announcement ordered by His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas been anticipated by the communique issued here on 3rd May the text of which hasbeen widely telegraphed abroad by local correspondents.  The fact that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  intend to  institute a national Government  here  has  moreover beentelegraphed  to every town in  Mesopotamia  by Nuri  Pasha, vide  my telegram  of 5th May, No. 5414.    The second  portion of  your telegram apparently commits  us here to furtherspecific consultation and.  discussion with the people of this country with object  of reaching conclusions in time to be of assistance to Peace Conference.
    It is with  great regret that I  find myself  compelled to ask  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to reconsider this portion of their announcement.    Please see para. 3 of my telegram of 20th March, No. 3539, and last paragraph ofenclosure in my Despatch of  22nd February 19.19  (? S. 24) Miss Bell&apos;s note on self-determination in Mesopotamia.  Similar sentiments have been repeatedly expressed tome by other leading Arabs.    I submit that it is for His Majesty&apos;s Government as Mandatory Power to prescribewhat  form  of Government  shall be  set up in  the  immediate future.   To  referquestion afresh to divisional councils and to  &quot; local opinion &quot; can have but one result.The extremists, who, following the example of their colleagues in Syria, are demandingabsolute independence for Mesopotamia with or without Abdullah, will by threats andby appeals during coming  month  of Ramazan  to religious  fanaticism win overmoderate men who have hitherto looked to His Majesty&apos;s Government for a schemeoffering a reasonable chance of  success and which  they can support.   The moderatescannot oppose extremists unless they know that His Majesty&apos;s Government is preparedto give them active support.     If during the next seven, days I can be authorised to announce that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment provisionally approve, constitutional  proposals  made by me and have instructed me to communicate them  to leading inhabitants, with a  view to giving effect to them in the autumn  there are grounds for hoping that we shall be able to count upon support of  a strong block of moderate opinion.  Once this is  done weshall  be in a position to deal  with the extremists.  An  announcement that Sir P. Coxwill  shortly return as  High Commissioner would  also be  of  great value in thisconnection.     I beg for orders on these lines at earliest possible date.     As a Staff officer of  the General  Officer Commanding-in-Chief I have a  responsi-bility towards him  also in that.I  could not properly without his approval  take actionwhich would  imperil his forces  and  numerous women  and children, and  lengthenlines  of communication in his  charge.  Further consultation with local opinion have this result.
