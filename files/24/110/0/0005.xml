The War  Office,                                                 W. S. C.         29th July, 1920.    In  accordance  with  conclusion (5) of the Conference  of Ministers held  on 9th December, 1919, relating to the erection of memorials on the battlefields a Committeehas been set-up &quot; to consider and report on the forms of national war memorials and the sites on which they should be erected together with estimates of cost.&quot;    The Committee was composed with the  Prime Ministers concurrence as follows :                                   Chairman.     The Right: Hon. The Earl of Midleton, K.P.                                   Members.     Colonel The Hon. Sir James Allein, K.C.B. (New Zealand).     The Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P.     Rear-Admiral Sir R. W. Benttnck, K.CM.G, C.B. (Admiralty).     The Right Hon. Andrew Fjsher (Australia).     Mr. D. S. MaoColl, M.A. (Wallace Collection).     Lieut.-General Sir G. M. W. Macdonogh, K.C.B., K.C.M.G. (Adjutant-General).     Major T. Nangle (Newfoundland).     The Hon. Sir G. Perley, K.CM.G. (Canada).     Sir Malcolm Ramsay, K.C.B.  (Treasury).     The Right Hon. The Lord Riddell.     Major-General The Right Hon. J. E. B. Seely,  C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.     Sir Aston Webb, K.C.V.O., C.B., P.R.A.     Lord MidletoiVs Committee recommends that :-      (i.) It is  desirable to erect an Imperial Memorial  at Ypres in the form of a           gateway at the Menin Gate at a cost  not exceeding  150,000?. and  that           the Dominions  should be given, an  opportunity of associating themselves           with the scheme should they so wish.     (ii.) Suitable  memorials,  such as a cross, an obelisk, a cenotaph, or a sea mark,           should be erected at a total cost not exceeding 150,000/. by the United           Kingdom  on the  most memorable battlefields in France and at Gallipoli           and Salonica;  the questions of Palestine,  Mesopotamia and East Africa           being reserved for further consideration if necessary.     The effect of these recommendations  would be that a single  memorial would be erected at Ypres typical of  Imperial unity, while the United Kingdom should, like the Dominions, erect other memorials to its own troops elsewhere.  Ypres is chosen as the site of the  Imperial Memorial because it  stands for the  troops of the Empire  as  a symbol of the war in a way unequalled  by  any other place; practically&apos;every unit in the army fought there.  The actual sites for other memorials remain to be chosen.     Before further definite steps can be taken it  is necessary for the Committee to know whether the requisite  funds  will  be forthcoming.   A  total expenditure of up to  300.000  (which could not fall upon Army funds  and for  which a special vote would be necessary) does not appear unreasonable  in view  of the  fact that all the Dominions a.re spending public money on their own memorials;  Australia, for instance,  has already erected five memorials on the Western front, Canada has voted a sum of&quot;500,000 dollars for her memorials, while New  Zealand,  South  Africa and Newfoundland are all negotiating for the acquisition of-sites for memorials to be erected at their Governments expense.(B20/332) JOG  7/20  H&amp;3, Ltd 8422w.)
