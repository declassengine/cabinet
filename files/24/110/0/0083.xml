CiBIOTi                      RUSSIAN TRADE COIvMlTTflE *                          (Reference  CP.1778)*         Memorandum &quot;by  the  Chancellor  of the Exchequer..        - I  desire  again to  call  the  attention of  the  Cabinet  to  the    letter  frrm the Governor of  the  Bank of England circulated by    me  on the  22nd July (CP.1674).         It would  in my opinion  have a deplorable  ,cffeet in  the    City if clause 8 of the proposed agreement were allowed to    stand in its present  form.   By naming certain private debts    and emitting all mention of  others,  we appear to  justify  and    even to expect the  repudiation of  those  that  are  not expressly    named,  we may, if  necessary, forego  expressly cr tacitly the    repayment  of debt owned by Russia  to the British  Government but    we  ought not to condone expressly  cr tacitly  the.repudiation    of  debts due ta individuals  or institutions.                                   (Intlld.)  A.C.7th August,  192Q.
