                          A N N E XV              THE BLOCKADE AND OTHER NAVAL MEASURES.Li IBALTICV  1*   If  a  blockade  is  to bo usod as a measure of pros sure, and of pres-\    .  sure  only without any declaration of war, wo can carry out a block-      ade of the Russian coast in the Baltic, provided that considerablej      risk  is accepted  that our blockading force may be driven off with    -  loss  by a superior enemy force.It     If Helsingfort can be used as a base the blockade in the Baltic      will  bo effective.5.     If Finnish aerodromes are available aircraft can be usod for recon-,,                                                               Kronstadt.      naissance purposes and possibly for torpedo attack on the ships at/                 whichit     Rcval, through/most of the imports enter Russia, mmld have to bo      included In the blockade.5.     Failing Bclsingforr, the base of operations would be Danzig, but      owing to its distance (300 miles) from thj? line of blockade which      would have to  ho  maintained, the blockade in this case would not      be so effective5.     Iif Danzig fell into the enemy&apos;s hands or became unavailable, no     &apos;      blockade would bo possible in the Ba-ltic unless we could Utilise a      neutral port.&apos;HE BLACK SEA,It     As regards naval  operations in the Black Sea, the first step is to re      establish the  Naval Mission at General Wrangel&apos;s headquarters.
