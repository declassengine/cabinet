Reference BaghdacVs No.  9577 of 26th. July to War  Office regardingpossibility of second division being sent to Mesopotamia.  Please see paras.  1-4 ofmy 8607 of 7th July and my 6725 of  28th May and 9618 of 24th July, which explain the situation as regards  despatch of  troops from  India and repatriation and relief ofthose now overseas.    2. We have at  present  17 Infantry and  Pioneer  battalions  we  can make available for this purpose, viz., eight earmarked for disbandment, nine earmarked for overseas reliefs.  If it is absolutely essential, therefore, to reinforce Mesopotamia beyondone division, we can, by further  checking disbandment,  delaying reliefs, provide thefollowing formations  of  an additional division :-Nine Indian Infantry battalions, onePioneer battalion, three  field companies Sappers and  Miners, three  brigade sectionsSignal Company, three Small Arms Ammunition Sections, one Headquarters DivisionalSupply Company, one Headquarters Divisional Supply Column, three  Brigade SupplySections, one  Divisional Troops Supply Section,  ten Bakery  Sections,  ten ButcherySections, four  Combined Field  Ambulances,  one Casualty  Clearing Station,  oneSanitary Section,  one Mobile Veterinary (?  Section).  No  British troops could be spared, but we could make available one and  a  half pack mule corps and one anda  half or possibly two  draught mule corps, which would  provide for British troops and second line transport of units of  division.     3. As regards headquarters of  division,  Infantry brigades, Divisional artillery and Divisional  Engineers, we  cannot  provide  either  commanders or their staffs  orclerical establishments from within our present resources without much dislocation.     Moreover, it would probably be  necessary to  stop all  leave of British officers  ofIndian units in India, and to recall those on leave ex India. - This would be  most undesirable.   Leave is greatly overdue  to all these  officers,  and many  require iturgently on private affairs.     Part 2 follows./
