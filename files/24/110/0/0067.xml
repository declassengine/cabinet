CABINET.            THE HOUSING BOHP CAMPAIGN IN WALES.        (Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)     I circulate for the information of the Cabinet thefollowing extract from a letter written by Sir WalterNicholas, the Cleric of the Rhondda Urban District Council,to Mr, E. Tudor Owen of the Ministry of Health,  a copy ofwhich was sent to me by Sir W.H.N,Gosohen, the Chairman ofthe Housing Finance Advisory Committee           &quot;The Housing Bond Campaign has been launched   and Lord Astor addressed a large Public Meeting which   was held at Porth on the 14th instant.  So far there   has been but little response as I am sorry to say   there is an active propaganda being carried on   against Housing Bonds by certain prominent Trades   Unionists.   Arrangements have been made for   holding in the course of the next,weak-cabinet 10  days   Ward Meetings, and it is to be ho.ped that as  a result   of these Meetings there will be a fairly generous   response on the part of the public.&quot;            The Secretary of the Advisory Committee hasadded the iloT Towing note:-           &quot;In an interview with the Committoo Sir Walter   Nicholas stated that colliery owners had originally   expressed theme elves as willing to put up some houses,   if the workers would do something on their part.   Extremists in the district were now conducting a   campaign against Local Bonds and at the same  time
exploiting tho lack of houses for politicalpurposes.  Therefore progress on houses has toa great extent been arrested.  Tho coal owners were meeting shortly to discuss the matter.&quot;                           (Initialled)  A*treasury,  S.W.    11th August,  1920.
