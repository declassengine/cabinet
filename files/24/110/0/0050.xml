MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR  WAR.    I circulate herewith, for.reference to the Irish Situation Committee; a memorandumby  General  Macready, setting forth his  views on the present  military situation inIreland j together, with a. general forecast of the arrangements which it may be necessaryto make during the coming winter.                                         -                           W. S.  C.    THE WAR. OFFICE,         6th August, 1920.    It cannot be said that the  Military situation to-day is more advanced  than it wasin the middle of April of this year.    The troops are certainly more experienced in the peculiar Conditions in this country,but this is discounted to some extent by the increased activity and boldness of  their opponents, who are daily becoming better armed, better disciplined and better  established.While the troops in Ireland have been very considerably reinforced, they are  of necessitymore scattered, entailing increased responsibilities and difficulties of supply and transport.The demands for transport are  being met  rapidly by the Army Council, but this againhas during the last month been considerably discounted by the .partial paralysis of therailways, a  paralysis which will probably result in a very short time in the total shuttingdown of railway communications throughout the country, except possibly in Ulster. ^   The increased efficiency of our opponents is without doubt very largely due to therelease of leaders who were interned without trial  during the&apos; early part of this year; apolicy Which probably paralysed the organization; but the Continuance of which, for political reasons,  it was impossible to maintain.   Individuals who came back  from internment are reported as being more active than  they were before arrest.    Under present  circumstances, the army continues to act  &quot; in aid of bivil pdwerj&quot;and the initiative lies mainly with our opponents.  In my opinion,  while both men and officers, are keen upon their  work, and are daily improving  iii powers of initiative and self-reliance- the police forces of the country are in a much worse state than tHey  were three months ago, with  the result that the task of the army is increasingly difficult:    In a few words, the position is this, that while our opponents are making  war  onus; we are acting in support of  civil  power, the forces  of which  are less reliable  thin.they were six months ago, and, as a necessary corrollary to our support, a great numberof troops are engaged in purely passive defence of localities,  buildings, &amp;C.    At the same time, great strides in certain brigades have been made with musketry,and a good deal of training has been done, not only according  to  Regulation, but alsowhat is necessary to meet the peculiar situation here, which is; without doubt, valuablein that it  stimulates initiative, responsibility and alertness.   From a purely trainingpoint of view, I do not think that it will be found that units Coming from this country will; when looked at from a broad point of view, be  in any way inferior to those whoare being trained under more peaceful Conditions.    From time to time, criticism has been levelled at unfortunate incidents  which  have occurred in connection with  the raiding of  unguarded buildings, and the overpoweringof weak guards mounted for purposes of protection.   It is often forgotten  by criticsthat the capacity to afford protection depends upon the limitation  of numbers, and the&quot; nights in bed &quot;  which it is possible to obtain for troops, more especially for the young    &apos;(Ui0,&apos;350J 100 8/20 H&amp;S, Ltd 8458wo
and partially trained soldiers of whom the army is at present composed.   If the army were  composed  of  veteran troops, the  situation would be  much easier, and smalldetachments would give us no anxiety in regard to their capacity for resistance.    Speaking generally, the Divisional Generals, the  Brigade Commanders,  the Staff,and, with a few  exceptions, the Commanding Officers of battalions in this Command,are the very best that can be imagined, but there is a shortage of good company officers,and when it comes to non-commissioned officers,  the weakness of the Army is woefullyapparent, though they are willing  and anxious to learn.  The men, though keen  and*equally willing, are in many cases averse to  using their  weapons with effect for  reasons of youth and inexperience.   While, as I have said, all ranks are interested  in  the workand show increased keenness, the number of desertions and applications for discharge areheavy, which indicates that  service  in this country is not popular.  This, of course,varies in  units  and depends to  a great extent  on the personality  of  Battalion  and company Commanders.     I have already officially put forward a protest against drafts being called for  from ireland during the coming  winter, because if the  political situation remains  as at presentthe removal of the older and best trained non-commissioned  officers and men from units will, in my opinion, constitute a very great danger, not only to the troops themselves butalso to the larger question of the maintenance of British supremacy in the Island.    T am well aware of the difficulties with  which the Army Council are faced  in  thisrespect, but I trust that some  way will be found to avoid drafting men from  this country,at all events until the spring,  as the long winter  nights  are always the most dangerous.     One of the great difficulties both in regard  to the  command of troops, and to thetroops themselves, is that under present conditions it is necessary for the troops to beon as good  terms with the inhabitants  as possible, and  at  the same time to be willingand ready to shoot if occasion requires.  It is  this that makes it so difficult to bring home to young lads the fact that they are liable to be attacked at any moment bypeople who pretend to be on good terms with  them, or who seem to be carrying out their daily avocations  (this was  very marked  in the attack on troops at KingsbridgeStation  on the  19th July,  when the majority of  the  attackers were apparentlyrailwaymen dressed in blue overalls).     Generally speaking, relations with the inhabitants  are  good, due probably to thefact that the British soldier is always inclined to  be careless and friendly  individuallywhether his  opponent be an  Irishman  or a Ghazi.   In the same way, eliminating thefanatical faction, the people of the country generally  are friendly towards the soldier.    ,From  my  own  observation, and  after  consultation  with the General  Officersthroughout the  Command, I am satisfied that while the great Irish question will never be solved  by force, it is necessary that increased  power  should  be given  to those responsible  for  maintaining the  Government  of  the country,  if the  Royal  irish constabulary is to be saved, and a semblance of law and order preserved.   The dublin metropolitan Police  are, in  my opinion, quite  past redemption,  and  the policing  of dublin, except so far as the appearance of occasional men in  police uniform  is concerned,must be, as at present, undertaken by the military.          ,     The  Government are, I understand, taking certain measures to replace by military courts the civil courts  of the country, which, as  shown  by the late Assizes,  havecompletely lapsed, and also further measures to bring members of illegal societies withinthe grip of courts-martial,     There is no doubt but  that the arrest  and  trial (for arrest without ultimate  trialwill,  I am convinced, never be tolerated for  long by the proletariat of Great Britain) ofthe leaders, both  male  and  female,  of the illegal  societies will&apos; result  in  a  general improvement of the situation, and  possibly,  although this is  by no  means  certain,produce a resurrection of public spirit by which it may be possible to secure convictionsin civil courts.    . A further measure, which to my mind is of the first importance, is the regulation of the Press in this  country, which is, I  am convinced, responsible for  many of themurders and outrages that have been committed.                  .                ,      If these measures become effective in the near future, I believe that much may be done toward the enforced tranquility of the country, except possibly in certain wild and inaccessible parts of the south and west.      It must be remembered, however, that owing to the railway paralysis, the troops, even with the increased transport which has been lavishly poured into the country, will not be as mobile as if the railway service was effective.  *      As  regards the  location of  troops  during the winter months, it  is extremelydifficult to foretell with any accuracy  what the position may be, but  assuming  that
there is no very marked improvement of the  conditions  obtaining to-day, I  think thefollowing general outline may prove to be more or less oorrect:      We are faced with two diametrically opposed principles:      (a.) Dispersion in order to afford immediate and constant support of the police.     (b.) Concentration to allow of some  comfort, training, leave, and rest to the troops.     During the present summer, we are tending toward an extreme of dispersion inorder to help the police to the utmost, and to maintain  them in positions from whichthey would otherwise have had to withdraw.  It must be fully  realized that as long asthe Forces of the Crown maintain a defensive  attitude, concentration  of troops will befollowed by a withdrawal of police, and the consequent abandonment  to our  opponents of the evacuated area.  This must be faced to some extent during the winter, in orderto avoid indiscipline, discontent, and incompetency in the ranks of the Army.     I propose therefore that during the winter months, i.e., from the loth October :      1. The withdrawal of all detachments of less strength than a company or squadron.     2. To accommodate all detachments in buildings, commandeered when necessary.     3. To transfer&apos; a portion of held and heavy artillery to England  in&apos; order to make           use of the accommodation thus released for infantry and cavalry.     4. If found  necessary, when the details  are worked out, to send back to England           such cavalry as cannot be suitably housed, but I doubt if this step will be           necessary as it may be possible to obtain  accommodation.     5. Schemes are being worked but in divisions on the above lines, but it will  take a           little time before the  details can be completed.     The survey of  buildings which might be suitable for the future accommodation oftroops  has to be very carefully undertaken,  otherwise the buildings are  invariablydestroyed by our opponents.     Without wishing to be in the least optimistic, I have hopes that if the measures nowbeing considered by the Cabinet bear fruit and are sufficiently drastic,  a more vigorousoffensive policy against the illegal organizations, and especially their leaders, will enable us,as the winter approaches, to carry out the concentration of troops without necessarilywithdrawing police and abandoning districts to Sinn  Fein.     As a corrollary to the above  policy, I propose during the winter to  keep districtsunder observation by means of small motor flying columns at irregular intervals.     One &apos; point  I consider most  essential, and that is the granting of  full leave to  all ranks  during the winter.   The  men  are  deprived  under present conditions of  theiramusements and those recreations which are so necessary  for the contentment and health of youno&apos; men, and many officers have been serving under conditions which are even worse than&apos; actual warfare for nearly a year with practically no leave.    This cannot continue without  deterioration  setting in, and  I, therefore,  am strongly of opinion that leavemust be granted freely to all ranks from Divisional Commanders downwards.    In putting forward this&apos;Memorandum, it must be remembered that the situation inIreland to-day is far  worse and more difficult to all ranks of  the Army  than if  theywere engaged in actual warfare against an acknowledged enemy.   There is no clearly defined &quot; Front,&quot;  the lines of communication are liable to instant and sudden dislocationby the  very people who the moment before appeared to be on friendly terms, and theaction  of the  troops is dependent upon the  civil officials of the Crown,  including&apos;thepolice.   At the same time, the troops are working willingly and cheerfully, and there isno want of cordiality between  civil and military authority in any  branch of eitherService.
