             DISABILITY PENSIONS COMMITTEE,                     Third Report.     1.   The Disability Pensions Committee submit thefollowing further report dealing withA.        Pensions and &quot;Allowances of widows, ohildren and dependants of Warrant Officers, Non-Cwaaissionod Officersand men of the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Marines,and of Petty Officers and mon of tho Royal Navy, whosedeaths aceur after the war and are not attributable! tf-service in the war;  and b.        Pensions and Allowances tf widows, children -nddependants of officers whose deaths occur after the war andare not attributable to service in the war.          The Committoo hope to present at an early date a ,final report dealing with the retired pay tf officers wh*retire after the war on account of disabilities notattributable to the war, including the subject ef woundpensions.     A.   Widows, Children and Dependants tf warrant officers, ffon-Commlasionea Officers and Men, etc.     3,   Widows&apos; Pensions.     (a)  Entitlement.          The Committee are agreed that it is no longer possible to retain the old Army rule limiting pensions ttwidows formerly on the married establishment.  They have considered proposals tt grant pensions (m) to all widows,and (b) to those who during the soldier&apos;s life wereeligiblo for separation allowance or marriage allowance.It is understood that all wives will be eligible formarriage allowance when the soldier or sailer has attaineda certain age (26 in the Army and 25 in the flavy).          The Committee have considered whether a similarlimitation should be applied to widows1 pension, but onthe whole they are against making this distinction.  the exclusion of any widow would be contrary to the principles
of tho -Workmen1 s Compena-ation. Act.  Moreover as theCommittee are recommending certain provision, for dependantsand the widow if excluded from a widows&apos;  pension must atleast &quot;be reckoned as a dependant, the difference in costbetween theproposals is not great.   The Committee therefore recommend (a).          The Committee recommend that in general the rulasfor entitlement should not bo more favourable than thoseprescribed under the pre-war Warrants, without specificTreasury sanction.  Under pre-war Warrants the widows pensionwas given in cases cf death in action, or death from woundsor injuries received in the performance of military duty,and death from diseaso, contracted or commenced on active service.  The Committee now recommend that there should bea slight extension as regards injuries and a restriction as regards deaths from disease and that pension should hegranted in all cases in whioh it is proved that d.sath is directly attributable to the conditions of service, i.e.,/the rule will be the same as in the case of disabled men.     (1?)  Rate of Pension.          Under the pre-war Warrants the basic rate of widows pension was 5/- a week to which additions were madein respect of rank.   The practice cf the war Warrants on  theother hand, is to give one half of the maximum disabilitypension at the rate appropriate to the rank, to a widow under40 years of age and without children and two-thirds of themaximum disability pension to a widow over 40 years of age crwith children.  The war-rates applied, however, to widows  ofmen serving compulsorily under  the Military Service Acts,  andwere necessarily formulated on more generous lines than thosewhich apply to peaae-time conditions and to purely voluntary service.         After careful consideration tho Committee havedecided to recommend a minimum basic rate of 10/6 a weok.                             .o                  This
This rate is to apply to a wiAtft without children and  in  t*he subject to inc.ease in respect of dependant  children,  age or infirmity.          The Committee recommend the following scale:-A widow not over 4$ years of age     and without childrenA widow fever 40 years of age     or with children s,d,10/6 a week17/6 &quot;   &quot;A widow over 60 years of ago                   0/- &quot;   ,T          The Committee recommend in addition the grant toa widowi under 40 yoars of ago and without children, of apension.at tho higher rate (i,e.  17/6d. a week)  in caseswhere there is satisfactory medioal evidence that she is unable to earn.     (c)   Rank Additions.          The Committee proposo the following weekly additions to be made to the widows pension in respect of the rank ofthe deceased soldiersArmy Rank.Navy Rank,Air Force  Rank.WeeklyAddition,Warrant Officer  (Glass  I)SergeantMajor I.s - d,7/6Warrant OfficerClass II and h.C.C.

 in pr^rar^x^rularti,only. in the oase of the remarriage ftf a widow in reoeipt  of pension should apply in the oases now under consideration, i.e. the pension ceases on remarriage, hut  the widow is  eligible for a gratuity equal to one year&apos;s pension in  fall discharge of all olaims.  But widows of Warrant Officers  Class I will be treated, as heretofore, as offioors&apos; widows.          In view of the pressure new being raised by ex- service organisations  for resumption of pensien in oase of need,,  the Ministry of Pensions would prefer the adoption  in the  caso of men of the rule now applicable to officers1 widows, viz. no gratuity on remarriage but resumption of pension cn second widowhood,  in case of need.      3.   Children1 s Allowance.          The Committee recommend an addition to the widow s                           s. pension of an allowance of 5/- u week for each child.  The conditions of award to be generally those prescribed in the pre-war regulations, subject to the adoption of the maximum age  of 16 in air casos for purposes of award and with the same rules as to exceptional continuance beyond that ago as in the warrant of the 5th December 1919.     4.   Motherless Children.          The Committee recommend a pension of 10s.  a weak for  each motherless child of a sailer,&apos; soldier or airman,whose widow, had she been alive, would  have been eligible for a pension under the recommendationc if the Committee,     5.   other Dependants.          No provision was made in the pre-war warrants for the grant of any compensation to the dependants, other than widows and ohildren, cf sailors and soldiers whese deaths were attributable to service,  apart from certaingratuities in the oase of the  Navy.  The War Warrants domake such provision.
          Coiisi^ja^e^cilYertTity cf opinion- exist&amp;*.m&amp;ng the  re-prse-eirtatires  of the different departments cn the questions whether any such provision should be made in the post-war warrants, and if s&amp;, to what extent and. on what conditions.  The views of the majority of the Committee may  be summarised, -          fa)  there should be provision for dependants;          (b)  need, relationship, proof of dependence should               all be necessary conditions to any grant;          fo)  where any grant is made under paragraphs 2 to               4 above to a widow, and/or a child or ohildren,,               any claim of other dependants of the same               man must be regarded as barred;          (d)  the total provision for dependants must in no               oase Axoeod 10s. a week save in the special               case referred to in paragraph 6 (b) b^low in               which oase the limit is 12s.6d.          Proof of dependence means proof of dependence at timo of doath.  The Ministry of Pensions disagrees v/ith the limita- tion of proof of dependence to dependence at the timo of death; the main reason for the grant of pension being that of need, actual dependence at the date of death should not be insisted on, if the circumstances of the family have so changed since then, (e.g.  by the death of the breadwinner) that it is probable that the soldier, had he lived,  would then have contributed to the support of the family.     6.    The only dependants who should  be recognised, are parents and brothers and sisters.          Parents.          (a)  If the man diei in oiroumstanoes such that had he left a widow she would have received an attributable pension, his parent or parents may be granted a pension of 7s.6d. aweek (10s. if there are tvo parents)  provided that, (1) they are in pecuniary need, (2) they were largely                                               dependent/
dependent on the maw, and (3) the man dii not  leave a widow or ohild.          (b)  On the parents,  or one of the parents, attaining the ago of 10, or if one of them is seriously  incapacitated                                               s dby ill health, the pension may be increased by 2/6 per week.          Brothers and Sisters.          (c)  If the man died in circumstances suoh that, haAhe left a widow, she would have received an attributablepension, his brothers or sisters under 16 years of age may                                               sle granted subject to the collective limit cf  10/-,  allewanceoas if they were the children tf the soldier, provided that(I) they are in pecuniary need, (2) they were  largely dependenton the man,  and (&apos;&amp;) the man did not leave a Widow,  ohildor pensionable parent.          The allowance may be continued over  the age of16 in the same circumstances as in the case of children.     7,   Warrant Officers.  Class I (Army xnd  Air Force)               The Committee recommendthat ordinary widows pension and children1s allowance should remain payable under the conditions of  Article783 of the Pay Warrant of 1914 but the rates will bealterei          from  20 to  30 per annum for the widow and          from  5 to  10 per annum for each chili.6*-
If    B.  Widows, Ohlldro arid ftependani * of Officers.   8.   Under the pre-war warrants there were, threedifferont Scales of pension for officers1 widows:- viz.ordinary, intermediate and highest.    Where the highestscale was allowed (officer killed in action or died cfwounds received in action within 7 years of having beenwounded) a gratuity was also paid ranging from  100 to the widow of a second lieutenant to  3,500 to the widow of aField Marshal.    A further complication has resulted from the fact that during tho war pensions on the highest(in lieu of the intermediate) scale hut without gratuityhave been paid to widows of offioers whe die from illnessdirectly traceable to fatigue privation or exposure or inconsequence of injuries received in the performance ofmilitary duty other than death in action or from woundsreceived in action.    There are thus at the present timefour different types of awards.    As the Boyal Warrantof 2nd July 1920 distinguishes in the case of the highestand intermediate pensions, between widows with childrenor over 40 and widows without children and under 40,  thereare in effect seven different scales.        The Committee are decidedly of opinion that it            Tis undesirable to continue so complex a scheme asa permanent arrangement.    They do not consider that in postwar conditions there is sufficient reason, in the oase ofofficers1  widows, for ,distinguishing between widows with children or over 40 and widows without children and under 40.Moreover the existing war scheue is difficult to administerand involves endless disputes and appeals.    The Committeeare in favour of merging the highest and intermediatescales of pensions in attributable oases.
        If thoy had a free hand in the matter, the committee would not recommend the continuance of the systemof granting gratuities in addition to pension to widowsin the special case of offioers killed in action.In the actual ciroumstanoos they arc, however, unable torecommend that these gratuities should be abolished.Apart from the opposition which would be raised en grounds of tradition and sentiment, the Committee have to face the position that, if the gratuities ^ere abolished, itwould almost certainly be necessary to increase theattributable scalu of pensions, as compensation, probablytt a degree which would raise thorn too much above thointermediate rates for the great war.    But while thnyconsider that &quot;the gratuities should remain, the Gonnittoewould limit them In future, if possiblo, to cases of doathin action and from wounds received in action.    certain questions arising on this will require further detailed consideration by the Departments concerned, for example the Committee think that the Treasury and the Air ministry should consider whether it is any lorx^&amp;r necessary toinclude in those cases in which gratuity is paid the caseof a widow of an officer who is killed or dies of injurysustained on flying duty or while being carried on duty in aircraft under proper authority.         The amount of the gratuities up to the rank ofOolonel inclusive should remain approximately as at present,but the ovtromolv Doigh rates for widows of General officers are susceptible of some Modification.                                                Assuming-   -*
          Assuming the retention of  gratuities  on these terms,  the  Committee  have  considered  what  scale  would be appropriate as  an 1 attributable&apos;so ale&apos;,  and  have decided to  reeomraend that the 1 rightist&apos;  scale in Article 654 Of  the  Pay  Warrant be adopted *  with the  modification of raising the Subaltern1s widow from   80 to   00  and grading the Generals&apos; Widows.      This  plan  will  secure an advance in  rates tj those  widows who would formerly have  received an  intermediate pension or  less, while ensuring  in general that thosewho would have been eligible for  the  highest, receive not less pension than under existing pro-war regulations.            One difficulty,  however, has  had  to be considered. The proposed rates 10r widows of Colonel.  Lieutenant Color.el, Major and Captain are slightly  higher  than those in the Great War intermediate  scale for  widows under  40 and without depeniUlit children.    The Committee consider it  very undesirable to xovise  the ^reat  War rates  again,  and they think the difference  can be justified  on the following- grounds  - (l)  the new rate is to include highest cases as well  as  intermediato,  and to apply  to widowe over 40 an;&apos;. with  children as well as to those undoj 4,3 - and without children; (s) the  Great War widows  on reaching the ago of 40 will  attain  rates  in  excoss of  those now proposed for post- war  oases;   (0)  many  of tho Ore at W...r widows of  Regular Officers are eligible for alternative pensions higher than either of the flat rate scales in question;  ($) the proposed scale will &quot;apply to strictly attributable cases  only,  whereas the Great liter scale is applicable also to oases  of aggravation.           Should   it provo, contrary to the expectation ofthe Committee, that this position cannot be defended inpractice, and should the war ratos of the few widowsconcerned be raised to level of the  proposed post war                                               attributable*   w*
attributable rates,  the Committee are advised  by theMinistry of Pensions that tho ocat will bo,  allowing for the fact that at least half the war widows will be eligible for Alternative Pension,   1,500 per annum.     9.   The Committee-therefore recommend  the  followingclaasification:-     (i)  Ordinary peksion:  non attributable  death,  including                             cases of retired  offioers.    (ii)  Attributable pension: death due to wounds,                             injuries,  or disease directly                             attributable the  conditions  of                             service.   (ill)  Attributable pension:  killed in action or  dies of         plus gratuity                             wounds received in  potion.          In all cases the present rule as to  death withinseven years ef the casualty as a condition to  an &amp;wt.rd willbo maintained.                                       10.  Tho
