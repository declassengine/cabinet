          - &apos;   EXTRACljf FROM  THff  FINAL  CONTUSIONS. .OF THE             . 33rd MEETING&apos;  OF THE  2INANC5S!&apos;CQMITTEE.38RAL     2.  THc  committee  agreed  that  it was, desirable to  have ajfANCIAL.  ...&apos;UATION.  general  discussion on  expenditure.             It was  pointed out that  the  public  did not know,  and had no         proper meaha  of&apos;knowing^., the real,  position.   Agitation in the         press and in  parliament, had  led the, public to believe that        -high taxation was,  in.  the main,,  due to  Departmental  extrava-         gance. &apos;  It  was1 necessary  to  bring home  to the man  in the    &apos;  &apos;  &apos; street&apos; such factors as the  8,,.000,000,000 Debt,  the  heavy      &quot;&apos;&apos; annual&apos;expenditure on  pensions,and  increased  wages,  and to   *         point out&quot; thatwith the  best  will  in.the world, the Government         had only a  small margin to--work upon.  There  was a general         impfessien  throughout  the community, that  it was possible to         effect&apos; great  savings without, giving,up  anything of material         value, and  it-would have  to-be,, explained  that great  savings         could only  be-. off ected. by giving, up Mesopotamia and  such things         &quot;as&apos; the Bread- subsidy,  and; involved  heavy  increases in railway         fares and the :likfr.The;  House of Commons should be  confronted         with facts  of this.kind,  in  ordex ,thett  it might realise the      &apos; &apos; &apos; true position.             it was  urged  that  the best method of  bringing  the position         home  to  the public would  be  to have a,2?tofec in the  House of        &quot; commons, which, might possibly  take  place  on the Second or     &quot;&quot;,   Third Heading, of  the Consolidated Fund Bill.   It was pointed         out that&apos;in-very-.similar  circumstances  last Autumn a Debate         bad cleared the -air -and had  strengthened  the  position of the         Government,-enormously.,on the other hand, it was  felt that         the effect:of&apos;a Debate,of this, kind was merely temporary, that         the attitude&apos;.of - the public  generally was  much more critical and         expectant than it  had. been  a$,ear, ago, and- that the general         feeling&quot; was that-..considerably  more  waB  expected than a Debate. kOBED   it was then Suggested; that  a Committee  should&apos; be set up, U-TTEF  ..                     - t ATI ON-  composed of impartial;  and ,unprecedented ju diced persons, who  would --XpiJiNDI - xdok  into &quot;the&apos;.problem  solely..with .the view of finding a          solution, and:who  would,not  be biassed by personal or                            1 2.  &apos;
political considerations.. .  This Committee should comprisemen like Lord Inchcape,. Sir George Murray, Lord Colwyn, SirHope Simpson (of the Lank of Liverpool) and Mr. Rylands (oftho Federation of - British&quot;Industries).   It would also benecessary to have a representative of Labour, who should not&apos;he a Member of the House of Commons,.but who should be a man(v  the type of Mr. Frank Hodges.   Its purpose would Le tosvrrv-y the whole field of Government expenditure, and to&apos;make recommendations to the Cabinet.  .          In favour of this- surrxestion it was argued thatthe -public would be much more likely to have regard to therecommendations of a body of this.character than if such recommendations cane from the Government itself.  . It was almost certain that the findings of such a body would, in.&apos;the main, strengthen the bands of the Chancellor of theExchequer and of the Cabinet in enforcing economy.   As the&apos;&quot;proposed Committee would only have advisory functions, theCabinet would in no way be bound by its conclusions, andwould retain unimpaired its full powers of control and determination.  .          On the other hand, it was pointed out that thosetting up of a body of this kind might have serious reactionson the constitutional position of the Cabinet, .  Great questionsof policy could only be decided by the Cabinet,, and the public might easily get the impression that the latter had abdicatedits functions... Moreover, a Committee of this kind, composedof representatives of Capital and Labour, would probablyproceed on lines by which Capital would endeavour to cut clownevery form of social expenditure, while Labour would endeavourto effect reductions on the Fighting Services.  , The membersof the Cabinet were themselves the greatest experts on questions of policy to be found in the country, and, more-over, they occupied a well-defined and responsibleposition. , , They would be open to serious criticism if they
delegated their functions to:a body of outsiders withoutany real responsibility or without the same Bense of loyalty to one another,     The members of the Committee who took the latter viewfavoured examination &quot;by a Committee consisting of the, PrimeMinister, the Lord irivy i-jeal, the Chancellor of the ixche-quer, wir laming V.orthington Evans, plus the departmental minister concerned; but.it was pointed out that a properinvestigation Would ta&amp;e a, very considerable time, which ministers could not afford.  lAoreover, even if a Committeeof this kind saved  50,000,000 a year, the public wouldcontend that a Committee of outside experts, dealing withthe same problem, would have saved a$00,000^000 a year.     Ultimately the Committee provisionally decided, theSecretary of State-for ?*ar; dissenting :-    , (a) To aprrove the proposal to set up a Committee         on the lines indicated above:     (b) The Prime Minister undertook to  consider         the personnel of the Committee and r.o         submit namei*&quot;for tho consideration of the         finance Committee; and asked his colleagues         to consider names,     fc) !rhe Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to         prepare draft lerms of Reference for the         consideration of the $$nance Committee.
