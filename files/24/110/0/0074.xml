PART    I. THE   LABOUR   SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The industrial disputes situation remains comparatively quiet.  In the woollen textiletrade, hopes of a settlement have been brought nearer by the recommendation of theNational Association of Unions  in the Textile Trade for acceptance of the employers&apos;latest offer.  The meeting of engineering and shipbuilding trade unions in London on the6th August decided to withdraw from  the  wages  agreement of  1917.  This implies arepudiation of the policy of making applications to the Indus orial Court for increased wages .and the substitution therefor of direct negotiations with the employers.  It doesnot, however, open up the immediate possibility of a large industrial dispute.  Trouble is threatened among building trades operatives in  the South-Western area, owing to the deadlock reached by the National Conciliation Board over their claims for higher rates.The occasion of much unrest in this trade, however,  may be removed by the setting up ofa National Wages and Conditions Council to take the place  of the present ConciliationBoard machinery.  The meeting of the special delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federa-tion of Great Britain on the 12th August to  decide  the policy to be adopted in reply tothe Government^ refusal to entertain their double demand for increased wages and reducedcoal prices is the  most important industrial matter pending at the  close  of the week.    In the political sphere the first  General Congress of the re-constituted Second Inter-national at Geneva is important as marking the completion of the first stage in the post-war reconstruction of international Socialism.  By passing  a unanimous resolution on thesubject of war responsibility, one of the main obstacles to unity within the Internationalhas been overcome.   A definite  declaration  of hostility towards Bolshevism was made.The proposal to transfer the Bureau to  London points to the leadership of  the SecondInternational being in the hands of British Labour.    The dominant feature of the week has been the attitude of Labour  towards the developments in the Russo-Polish situation.   A belief in the possibility of war with Russiaover Poland led to a mobilisation of organised Labour opinion during the week-end.  Theformation of a &quot; ^Council of Action &quot; on  the 9th August and the summoning of a specialnational conference of Labour bodies for the 13th, show that the machinery necessary for organising a  general strike is being immediately improvised.   One notable feature of the developments is the fact that the moderate leaders  of Labour, and men who have repu-diated direct action on such political questions as nationalisation of the mines, are unanimouswith the more extreme elements on the present issue.  According, ho wever, to the statements made by Mr. E. Bevin in the interview between the Council of Action and the Prime minister on the 10th, and by Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., in the debate in the House of Commons on thesame date, the independence of Poland is an integral part of Labours international policy.The difference between Labour and the Government appears, therefore, to be a difference of interpretation of the  extent to which Polish independence  is threatened by SovietRussia.    The Unemployment Insurance Bill received Royal Assent on the 9th August.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer  announced in the House of Commons on the 11thAugust that  the Government had determined to abolish the bread subsidy by the end ofthe current financial year.  An increase  of Sd. in  the price of  the quartern loaf would bemade in September, and the remainder of the subsidy would be removed at or before theopening of the next financial year.The Unemployment  Position.    The number of H.M.  Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work donation policiescurrent for the week ending the 30th July was 139,866, made up of 139,137 lodged by menand 729 by women.  On the 23rd July there were, 146,954 policies current, 146,182 formen and 772 for women.
The General  Situation-continued.     On the 30th July, 77,901 unemployment books, 55,734 for males and 22,167 for females,remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Compared withthe previous week, when there were 53,146 books lodged by males and 21,139 by females,the total increase is 3,616.     The total live register for all Employment Exchanges on the 30th July was  225,801men, 47,842 women and 29,298 juveniles, compared with 230,512 men, 48,090 women and25,719 juveniles a week ago, and 235,051 men, 47,262 women and 22,357 juveniles a month ago.  A detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 240.General Topics.    Labour and Russia. A  general alarm  has been raised in  Labour circles over the russo--Polish situation.  On the 6th August  Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., secretary of theLabour Party, issued a telegram to  all local Labour Parties directing their attention tothe gravity of the position and urging them immediately to organise public demonstrationsagainst military intervention, and the  supply of men and munitions to Poland.  On thesame  date, the Daily Herald published a manifesto signed by various personalities in themovement, who have formed themselves into  a &quot; Resist the War Committee,&quot; invitingall men and women to pledge themselves not to undertake-military service against Russia,and not to make or transport munitions.   A strongly-worded manifesto headed &quot; AnAppeal to the British Nation,&quot; signed by eight Labour Party Members of Parliament, and eight  other leaders of Labour,  was also issued, declaring in emphatic terms that labour would not  co-operate in a new war on behalf of Poland against Russia.    On the 7th  August an urgent summons was issued by Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P.,Mr. 0 W. Bowerman and Mr. H. S. Lindsay, to the members of the executive of the LabourParty, the  Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the parliamentary labour Party, respectively, for a meeting on the 9th August in order to decide on definiteaction in the event of war.  Over the week-end meetings  of local Labour bodies were heldin most large industrial centres to protest against intervention of any kind against Russia.Resolutions were passed, which, if they were  to be carried into effect, would mean a general&quot;down tools&quot; policy.  The Standing Joint-Committee  of Industrial Womeh&apos;s  Organi-sations have passed a resolution demanding  immediate peace and the resumption of trade relations, and proclaiming that war with Russia would be an intolerable crime.  A similarresolution  has been passed by the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild.  The Daily Herald  pub-lished. a special Sunday edition devoted almost entirely to this question, and appealing fora general strike in the event of a decision for war.   This edition also contained a manifestoissued by the executive of the United Communist Party alleging among other things thatBritish soldiers  were blacklegging at Dantzig, where  German workers were refusing  to load munitions for Poland. *   The manifesto urged the establishment of a Central LabourCouncil to supervise the execution of Labour&apos;s demands on the Government in the interestsof  peace.   In  view of the  situation, the British delegates to the Second international conference at Geneva have expedited their return.    The special emergency meeting  of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades UnionCongress, the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary LabourParty was held at the House of Commons on the 9th August,  and passed the followingresolutions :                                                                   &apos;           &quot; That this joint Conference, representing the  Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and        the Parliamentary Labour Party, feels certain that war is being engineered between the Allied Powers        and Soviet Kussia, on the issue of Poland, and declares that such a war would be an intolerable        crime against humanity.  It therefore warns the Government that the whole industrial power of the        organised workers will be used to defeat this war.&quot;           &quot; That the executive committees of affiliated organisations throughout the country be summoned       . to hold themselves ready to proceed immediately to London  for a national conference,  and that       they be advised to instruct their members to &apos; down tools &apos;  on instructions from that national con-       ference, and that a council of action be immediately constituted  to take such steps as may be necessary       to carry the above decisions into effect.&quot;                                 -! &apos;*   * It is reported that the Labour Party have received a communication from the German IndependentSocialist Party on this matter, and an appeal to use their influence to secure the withdrawal of British troops from blacklegging the Dantzig dockers.FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.
      The  following were appointed  as a  &quot; Council  of Action &quot; :-Representing  the  Parliamentary Labour Party, Messrs. W. Adamson, J. R. dynes, J. 0&apos;Grady, John Robert-  sou, and Colonel Wedgwood; representing the Parliamentary  Committee of the Trades  Union Congress, Messrs. Harry Gosling,. A. A. Purcell, A.  Swales, R. B. Walker, and Miss  Margaret Bondfield ;  and representing the executive of the Labour Party, Messrs. A. G.  Cameron, Frank Hodges, C. T. Cramp, Robert Williams and J. Bromley.      On the 1.0th August the Council of &quot;Action co-opted as additional members Messrs.  Robert Smillie, W. H. Hutchinson, E. Bevin, J. H. Thomas, M.P., J. E. Bower, J. Ogden,  Ben Turner and A. Holmes. After an interview between  the Council  and the Prime  Minister, and the Prime Ministers statement on&apos;the position in the House of Commons, on  this date, the Council decided to summon a special Labour Conference of the Parliamentary  Labour Party  and the  executives  of  all  the  organisations affiliated to  the Trades  Union Congress and the Labour Party at the Central Hall, Westminster,  for the  13th  August, &quot; to consider the policy of  organised labour in  opposition to any  war against  Soviet Russia.&quot;   It has  been made clear that the Council of Action defines the phrase  &quot; any war &quot; to  cover not merely military action but also indirect help of any kind either by blockade or by supply of munitions to the forces at war against Russia.     Labour  and Ireland. No important developments in the position have  occurred during the week.   A report of the interview between a deputation of the expelled Belfast workers and the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress appears below.   A deputa- tion representing the evicted workers at Belfast waited on the 4th August on the Parlia- mentary Labour Party,  and later on the Chief Secretary to  the Lord Lieutenant.   It is understood that there is a possibility of an appeal being made to the British trade unions to institute a boycott of the port of Belfast.     Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. The proposal ot the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Labour Housing Association for a 24 hours&apos; protest strike  on  the  23rd August is now being supported  by some individual unions.   At a meeting in Glasgow on the 2nd August of the executive council of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers it was decided to instruct the districts to carry out the recommenda- tion for a strike &quot; to protest against the increase in rents and the taking  away of the protection afforded workmen living in  employers&apos; houses, which protected them against eviction unless suitable accommodation was offered.&quot;*   The Scottish Divisional Council of the  Iron and Steel Trades Confederation have also  agreed to advise all their members to stop work on this date.     At a conference of trade unionists called by the Newcastle Trades Council at Newcastle on the 7th August a resolution was carried unanimously calling upon all trade unionists to refuse to pay increases in rent and urging them to resist the Act by any means necessary.   &apos;     Building Trades:  Conciliation Machinery.-A conference  of the  executive councils of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, held at Montagu House on the 4th August, discussed the proposed agreement for the substitution of a national basis for an area basis in the regulation of wages  and hours of work.  The National Federation  of Building Trades Employers had  already approved of the  scheme, and it was reported that the ballot of the operatives was  in favour of adoption.  A decision was reached on both sides accepting the principle involved, and setting up a National Wages and Conditions Council which will eventually supersede the National Conciliation Board.   This council, which will deal  with wages- rates on a national basis, will be composed of twenty employers&apos; and twenty operatives&apos; representatives.   A sub-committee was appointed to  draft a constitution and a scheme for working the  new organisation.    Housing. The Government^ plans to accelerate the building of houses were explained to representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers  and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives at a conference at No. 10, Downing Street, on the 6th  August.   In the absence of the Prime Minister, the deputation  was received by the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Health and the  Minister of Labour.   The proposals of the Government will be submitted to the  Industrial Council for the Building Trades, who meet on the 12th.  It is expected that a  special committeewill probably be set up to investigate the scheme and report to the various organisations of masters and men. Mr. W. Bradshaw, secretary of the National Federation of Building   * Except for the provisions with respect to ex-Service men, the Act does not, in fact, put workmen whoare tenants of their employers in a worse position than before.
 Trades Operatives, stated in an interview that dilution and payment by results were impossible conditions.  Mr.  Hicks, president  of  the Federation,  said  that  acceptance of the Governments proposals would involve the re-organisation of the entire industry.     It is reported that the Wigan Corporation have accepted a  building guild  contract, amounting to upwards of  1.30,000, in connection with their housing scheme,  and that the  Manchester Housing  Committee  on the 9th accepted the tender of the Manchester Building Guild for the erection of 358 houses on the Clayton, estate, subject to satisfactory terms of contract being agreed upon with the Corporation and the Ministry of Health.     Coal Export Trade.&apos; The effect of the continued restriction of coal exports on employ- ment is still agitating certain trade union circles,  particularly in South  Wales.  The monthly meeting of the South Wales and Monmouthshire district committee of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation passed a resolution asking the  general secretary of the Federation to take up the matter with the Government with a view  to increasing the amount of coal available for export.     Mr.  J. R.  Bell, secretary of the  Hull branch of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union, has issued a statement to the Press urging the allocation of more coal for export from the Yorkshire and North Midland coalfields to the Humber district, in order to increase local employment.  It is reported that as a result of recent conferences, under whichit was sought to distribute the coal supplies so as to readjust employment, instructions have been received at Cardiff that no more tippers are to be discharged.     Cotton  Textile  Industry. As regards  the prospects . of   the  cotton  trade  the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, replying to a  circular sent out by the  Associated Chambers, have responded that the cotton trade shows every indication of recovery in the near future.  The general impression, it is stated, is that the present slackness is  merely temporary and that the trade should be able to find work for all trained operatives. It is expected that demand will continue and prices will not decline to any great extent. Industrial and  other  Organisations.    . Irish Trades Union Congress. The 26th annual  meeting of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress took place in the City Hall, Cork, from the 2nd to the 5th August.     The report  of the National Executive,  which was presented on the 2nd, declared that &quot; in supporting the railwaymen&apos;s refusal to carry troops and munitions they were challeng- ing not only the right of an Imperial Power to subjugate a small nation by armed force, but also the generally accepted conception of the relations between employer and employed by claiming for the  workers the right to refuse work which violated their consciences.&quot; Mr.  T. Farran, in his presidential  address, dealt chiefly with the  political situation.   He urged that there could be no compromise on complete independence.  &quot; The battle was almost won, thanks largely to the firm stand of labour against the handling of munitions.&quot;     On the 3rd  August, objection was taken to the reported reference of difficulties ^in the Clerical Workers&apos; Union to Dail Eireann, and the supremacy of  the Congress in  labour matters maintained.  Mr. T. Johnson, acting secretary, presented a report on the policy for reducing the price of Irish  food-products, and the policy of preventing the over-export of food-stuffs was approved.     On the  4th August  the  Congress confirmed, by 97  votes to 54,  the decision of executive not to send delegates to the Second International at Geneva.   In private session a deputation from the expelled workers of Belfast was received, and the following resolution was passed :-&quot;  lhat this Congress views with regret and disgust the seiious attacks made on the workers of Belfast, and. authorises the incoming National Executive to take immedi - ately whatever  action they may deem  necessary to protect the  interests of our fellow- workers.&quot;  Hints were made of. a boycott of the port of Belfast. The president submitted a report  on the  recent conference with certain members of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Trades Union Congress.  On the 5th August minor resolutions were discussed.    National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union. The annual conference of this union washeld at Haverfordwest from the 2nd to the 5th August.  The president, Mr. T. J. Wilson,emphasised the importance of  the substitution of national for local negotiations,  and saidthat the national awards had secured great improvements even if  they had not given themembers the standard which they set out to obtain.   The conference approved the actionof the union&apos;s delegates to the Special Trades Union Congress on the 13th July, in  votingfor the miners&apos; resolution,  in favour of direct action with reference to Ireland and Poland.Mr. Wilson was  re-elected president,
Trade Union  Topics.    National Union of Scottish Mine Workers- The final result of the ballot of this union on a 5-day working week is now reported to show a vote of 70,801 in favour and 27,820against,   ft is understood that action on this decision will be postponed, at least until thenational  demands  are settled.  With reference to these demands,  a conference of theunion, held in Glasgow on the 9th August, instructed the delegates to the special conferenceof the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain in London on the 12th, to support adherence tothe original demand for increased wages and reduced prices of coal.  Support will be givento a ballot on a national strike to enforce this demand.   Pending the result of the voting,the executive will be urged to recommend the adoption of a 3-day working week to preventowners stacking&apos; coal in the event of a strike.    National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers. The Council of this union, at a recent special meeting in London, accepted the scheme and rules for the proposed amalga-mation with  the National  Union of Printing and Paper Workers, whose Council  havealready approved the scheme.  The proposals will now be submitted to a vote by themembers of both unions.    National Asylum Workers&apos; Union. It  is understood that the arrangements for thefederation of this union wth the Poor Law Workers&apos; Union will come into  force from the1st  January next.   The executive have reaffirmed their previous decision not to federatewith the National Union of Corporation Workers.  In acquainting their members with thisdecision,  the  Executive  state that there is practically no community of interest betweenthem and the members of  this latter union and that they prefer federation with unionsmore directly concerned with the organisation of the public health and institutional services.Ex  Service Men.    Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations. As a  result of the definite  proposal,already noted in this Report, for the amalgamation of  ex-Service organisations, delegatesrepresenting  the various ex-Service men&apos;s organisations  conferred at the Royal UnitedService Institution, Whitehall, on the 7th  August.  Mr. T. F. Lister, president of theNational Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, presided, and, inan opening speech, argued that the ex-Service men&apos;s organisations were bound to concern themselves with political action.   He agreed, however, that they should be non-party,Avhich was not the same thing as non-political.   Mr. Jackson, president of the national association of Discharged  Sailors and Soldiers, made a strong plea for amalgamation andurged that party political action in any organisation tended to disruption.   Captain Towjse,V.C.,  speaking for the  Comrades of the Great War, said that they would always favouramalgamation, but they insisted on three essential points that the new organisation shouldbe non-political, non-sectarian  and truly democratic  ;  officers, non-commissioned officersand men should have equal votes,  and ihe amalgamation be confined to ex-Service.men-Mr.. Mander,  secretary of the National Union of Ex-Service men, asserted, that the onlycondition upon which his union could consider any  form of amalgamation would be a frankrecognition of the principles of anti-militarism and the abolition of the capitalist system.He  proposed  a resolution condemning British intervention in Poland, which was, however,ruled out of order.  Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, of  the Officers&apos;  Association,said it would be disastrous to form ex-Service men into a political, body, but urged that thequestion  of strictly excluding all but ex-Service men deserved more consideration.  some people not technically ex-Service men, as for example,  Earl Haig, could, do good work inan  ex-Service men&apos;s organisation.    A resolution was then  submitted suggesting that a  drafting committee be appointed,consisting of two members of each organisation to  be elected by their organisation, to draw up  a  draft constitution for the proposed new body.  Mr.  Mander then announced thatthe National Union did not wish to take further part in the proceedings failing agreement on two points ; resistance to militarism in the making of new wars, and removal of the specialhardships and injustices of ex-Service men and their  dependants by a policy based on thecommon  ownership of land and capital.  The chairman ruled that these questions werebeyond the scope of the meeting, and the resolution  for the appointment of the drafting committee was carried, the  delegates of the  National Union of Ex-Service Men abstainingfrom voting.
 International Relations of Labour.     International Federation of Trade Unions. The boycott of Hungary by the International Federation of Trade Unions which was begun on the 20th June, in reprisal for the alleged white terror, was called of! on the 8th August.  The, Austrian social democratic trade unions have been the chief agency for enforcing the boycott.  It is understood that its abandon- ment has been due to the failure of the Jugo-Slav and Czecho-Slovak trade unions to put it into effect.   The management committee of the Austrian trade unions were to have met on the 6th August to consider suspending the boycott on their own authority.  Any independent action on their part, however, was forestalled by the receipt of a message from M. Edo Fimmen, joint secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions, intimating the decision of that body to stop the boycott of Hungary on the 8th August &quot; although the situation in  that  country is still  unsatisfactory.&quot;   Apparently  this decision should he regarded as an acknowledgment of failure.     Second International Socialist Congress. The 10th International Labour and Socialist Congress opened at Geneva on the 31st July.  In the absence of the president, Mr. Branting, Mr.  Thomas Shaw, M.P., presided. There were present 120 delegates  representing 18 countries.*  Neither the  British Independent Labour Party, the German Independent Socialist Party, the French Socialist Party, nor the Austrian Labour Party were represented. Four Commissions were appointed to deal with the various items of the agenda, which were indicated in this Report for the 24th July, p. 135.     The Report of the Commission on war responsibilities, militarism and the League of Nations, who included the German delegates Herren Braun and Hue,  wag&quot; submitted.&apos; On the subject of war guilt, this report, which embodied largely a memorandum submitted to the  Congress by the  German Social Democratic Party,  acknowledged the crimes of Imperialist Germany and stated that Republican Germany had recognised its obligation to make reparation.     The other section of the, report criticised the Treaties of Peace, called  attention to the defects of the League of Nations, and declared that only a democratic league, including all nations whose democratic constitutions enabled them to keep their  engagements, could effectively guarantee peace.  Further discussion on this  report was  postponed until the 4th August.                                                -     The Commission on the unity of the International and its reconstruction recommended that the British section be invited to undertake negotiations for creating &quot; an International comprising all the forces of Socialism,&quot; and with this in view, to open relations with the Labour and Socialist national organisations not represented at Geneva. This was accepted by the conference together with a proposal for the transfer of the Bureau from Brussels to London.  The British section replied that they could not accept this  without reference to their national bodies.  Pending their decision, the  Bureau remains at Brussels, but the executive will meet regularly in London.     On the 4th August the report of the Commission on questions of war and peace was reconsidered.  A clause was added urging workers to persevere in their efforts to obtain control of the political and economic forces of their countries, and to.resume the struggle against the  militarists and imperialists by all means, political and  industrial, including refusal  to make and to transport munitions.   With  these additions the resolution was unanimously carried. The president, Mr. T. Shaw, drew attention to the importance of the International Labour Office, and hoped that its activity would be encouraged.  A delega- tion was appointed to investigate conditions in the Republic of Georgia.  The  British members will be Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, Mrs.  Snowden, and Mr. T. Shaw.     The report of the Commission on Socialisation was attacked on the score of its feeble- ness by Mr. J. Bromley.   The report favoured a programme of expropriation, with compen- sation funds to be  derived from property tax, capital levy, death duties and other imposition- tions.   A resolution in this sense was carried against the  votes of ten British delegates.     On the discussion of the report on political methods of socialism, a resolution repudiating Bolshevism and reaffirming the principles of social democracy as the basis of the workers&apos; International was passed.     It&apos;was decided to hold the next conference at Brussels, in 1922.  The following  were chosen to serve on the International Executive :  president, Mr. A. Henderson ; secretary,M. Huysmans (Belgium), with two British  co-secretaries  if the Bureau is transferred &quot;toLondon;  treasurer, Mr.  J. H.  Thomas; members  of the committee, Messrs. Branting, (Sweden), R. Macdonald, Troelstra (Holland), Vandervelde (Belgium), and Wels (Germany).     *&apos; At the outbreak of war the Second International included representatives from 27 countries.
148.20.238NEGO TIATIONS   AND  DISPUTES.Demands  and Negotiations.Building and Allied Trades.    Building  Trades Operatives  (South-Western  Districts). The  National ConciliationBoard for the building trades  met in London on the-3rd and 4th August to considerapplications from operatives in the South-Western area for higher rates, and, in particular,the claim of Bristol operatives for 2s. 4d. instead of  2s. per  hour.  The Board, failed toreach a settlement and a serious situation has thereby arisen.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.    Engineers  (National).-A  national  conference   of  representatives of engineeringtrade unions was held in London on  the 6th August, when the following resolution waspassed : &quot; That, in view of the unsatisfactory use made by the Industrial Court of thefour-monthly hearing agreement of February, 1917, we recommend  the  trade unions,signatory to the agreement, to  give notice to terminate the same.&quot;  It is expected thatthe unions concerned will act in accordance with the resolution and, in future, recoursewill be had  to direct negotiations with the employers.  It is reported  that no resolution was proposed at the conference concerning the rejection by  the Industrial Court of theclaim for Qd. per hour advance in the  wages of skilled adult workers, despite the fact thatresolutions protesting against the award have been passed by engineers in various centresthroughout the country.      * This account is based on reports in the Press and its detailed accuracy cannot be guaranteed.In view of the international situation, the British delegates expedited their return from geneva.    International Miners&apos; Congress. The 25th International Miners&apos;  Congress was held atGeneva from the 2nd to the 5th August. *  One hundred and forty-eight delegates werepresent, of whom about one-half were British.    On the 2nd August, the resignation of Mr. Thomas Ashton, the International secretary,was accepted ; and on the proposal of Herr Hue, of the German Miners&apos; Union, Mr. FrankHodges was  chosen  as  his successor.  Mr. Robert  Smillie, in his presidential  address,appealed for solidarity  and the avoidance of recriminations and, after  dwelling on  hisattempt to prevent war in 1914 by calling a meeting of the Congress, emphasised the powerof the miners to put an end to war by international action.   This question was furtherdebated in the afternoon, and it was resolved to refer the whole subject to the executivefor report before the close of the Congress.    On the 3rd August, Mr. Hodges proposed  a resolution calling for nationalisation ofthe coal industry without bureaucratic control, and also demanded an international MinesControl Board.  M. Bartuel, France, and M. Lombard, Belgium, both  pleaded for a secondresolution on action to accompany the British resolution on principle.   Finally the followingresolution Was carried : &quot; That this Congress is of the opinion that  each country should now definitely strive for nationalisation, or socialisation of the mines,  for the overthrow ofcapitalist  ownership  and for the establishment of joint  control  of the industry by therepresentatives, respectively, of the State,  the workers engaged in the-industry, and theconsuming public.  Each national secretary is to report to the international secretary everyquarter on the progress  made towards this.&quot;    On the 5th August, Herr Rose,  Germany,  spoke on  the  question of working  hours,urging three 6-hour  shifts with one repair shift.  This  would increase  production andabsorb a large number of unemployed.  M. Bartuel  said  that there would,  be  little hopeof introducing four shifts a day until the mines were nationalised.        ,    At the final session, the Congress unanimously  adopted three resolutions.  The firstthreatened a universal general strike in the event of a  future war menace.  The second wasa resolution on the nationalisation of mines.   The third resolution, proposed by Herr Hue,requested the Committee to take steps in conjunction with the International Labour Officeto set up an International Coal Board to supervise the  distribution of coal and other rawmaterials of the mining industry in order to relieve distress.
 Negotiations and Disputes-continued. Transport.     Coal Porters (London)-A meeting of London members of the National Amalgamated Coal Workers&apos;  Union was held on the 9th August when it was resolved that the coal merchants should be asked to open negotiations for increased wages and failing a settlement that a strike should be declared.   The meeting also demanded a public inquiry into the wages of coal porters.   The National Union of Vehicle Workers,  who also cater for coal porters, instructed their members not to  attend the meeting.  A strike  is considered unlikely, owing chiefly to the rivalry existing between the two unions. Food, Drink and Tobacco.     Bakers (London). It is reported that the employers have refused the application of the London operative bakers for a minimum wage of  4 for a 48-hour week.* Miscellaneous  Trades.     Co-operative Wholesale Society Employees. On the 6th August the Board of Directors of the  Co-operative Wholesale Society discussed  the dispute which has arisen  over the interpretation of the wages agreement of May, 1920.  They have  postponed their decision until after a further meeting to be held at Newcastle on the 13th August. Strikes and Lock Outs. Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.     Engine Fitters (Great Western Railway).-A  strike is in  progress of engine fitters employed by the Great Western Railway Company as  a protest against the  refusal of the Industrial Court, by Award No. 372, to grant their application  for a wage of  6 per week. The strike, which is confined to members of the Amalgamated Engineering  Union, began in South  Wales  on the  28th July, and  has since  spread  to Swindon, Birkenhead, Wolverhampton, Bristol and elsewhere. Settlements and Agreements. Transport.     Dockers (Middlesbrough). The dockers, who  have been on strike at Middlesbrough in support of the check-clerks, resumed work on the 6th August, an  agreement being reached whereby the clerks&apos; wages are increased.                              6 Public and Public Utility Services.     Gas  Workers (Wigan). The gas workers who struck at Wigan on the  31st  July, decided to resume work on the 9th  August under protest.     Street Paviors  (Leeds).-The  street paviors  and  masons employed by  the Leeds Corporation, who struck on the 17th July for the payment of building trade rates of wagesfreturned to work on the 4th August.  The General Purposes Committee of the City Council offered to submit the men&apos;s  claim to arbitration or to accept the result  of arbitrationproceedings which are to take place in connection with a similar dispute at Sheffield.  Theseproposals are being submitted to the men concerned.

Statistical. During the week the mens live register has decreased by 4,711, while thewomen&apos;s live register has decreased by 248.   The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 1,573 as regards men and a decrease of 1,215 inrespect of women.  All the divisions show decreases in the men&apos;s register, except Wales.The Exchanges showing the largest decreases are Deptford, King&apos;s Cross, Walham Green,Great Yarmouth, Norwich, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Dundee,Edinburgh and Birkenhead. The occupations chiefly affected by the decreases are thoseof painters  and  painters&apos; labourers, shop assistants, carmen, porters, motor drivers andgeneral labourers.    Increases in the register are reported from Plymouth, Coventry, Bradford, Parkhead,Blackburn, Shotton and Swansea Docks.  The occupations chiefly affected by the increases are those of puddling furnace workers,- crane drivers and shipyard labourers.    As regards the women&apos;s registers, all the divisions show decreases in the live register,except the London and South-Eastern, Yorkshire and East Midlands, and Scotland Divi-sions.  The Exchanges showing the greatest decreases are Southampton, Leeds, Otley,Glasgow (South Side), Govan, Liverpool and Widnes.  The occupations chiefly  affectedby the decreases in  the women&apos;s register are those of. clerks, dock workers and agricultural workers.Metis Employment.    General Outlook With regard to the shipbuilding and allied industries it is reported from the Northern Division that owing to transport difficulties, and consequent inadequatesupplies of material, there is considerable slackness at present in the Tyneside and Wear-side areas.  Employers are  unable to engage new labour to any appreciable extent. OnTees-side, however, the  labour situation continues to be  good.   It is reported from theNorth-Western Division that the position in those trades to which special reference wasmade in the last report unfortunately shows no improvement.  Unemployment in the liverpool district appears to have become, if anything, more acute, and the outlook isgloomy.    The cloud of depression has not yet lifted  from &quot;the cotton  industry, and short-timearrangements  are likely to  continue in operation for several weeks, owing to the lack of
 new orders.  Fortunately the slackness does not affect all cotton towns to the same extent- At Blackburn, where the depression is acute, 27 mills failed to resume work after the recent  holidays,  while at  Great Harwood  and Rishton, 14,000  out of 19,000 looms are idle.   On the other hand, at Oldham and  Nelson the staple industry is still active.  An optimistic feeling is still prevalent throughout the trade, and it is felt that the extreme point in the present depression has already been touched.     A  state of depression still prevails m the leather, boot and shoe, lace and cycle industries, and the calico  printing and  bleaching trades are in a less healthy state than during recent weeks.  There is still considerable slackness  in the agricultural implement trade owing to the greatly increased cost of production, which has raised the selling price to a point 300 to 400 per cent, above pre-war figures.     Industrial Developments. The extensive  works of the Timber Re-converting Co., Shrewsbury, which  have been closed down  since the  armistice, have been  purchased by a London firm of joinery manufacturers.  At Barrow-in-Furness Messrs. Thompson &amp; Butchart  are shortly to open a factory for the manufacture of nuts, holts and rivets. Woolwich  report that a new firm, the  Central  Gearing Co., will employ  a considerable number of skilled mechanics as soon as their machinery has been installed.     Labour Reductions. Owing to the depression prevailing in the boot and shoe trade the Oakham branch factory of Messrs. Brown, of Leicester, where a short-time arrange- ment had been in operation, has been closed for the present.  Messrs. Alldays &amp; Onions, Ltd., Birmingham, have  discharged 500 workpeople owing to the present depression in the cycle trade.   A number of discharges have  been taking place from the employment of Messrs.  Vickers, Ltd.,  and the  Barrow Haematite Steel Co., Ltd.  It is reported from Openshaw that Messrs. Robertson  &amp; Sons, Ltd.,  jam manufacturers, have now practically closed down as a  result of the general inactivity in the trade  due to the high price of  sugar. Weekly discharges continue to be made by Crossley Motors, Ltd., Manchester.  Messrs. A.  Godin  &amp; Co.,  Red Lion  Square, London,  manufacturers of  motor accessories, have closed down owing to over-production  during the past year,  and the prompt payment required for all raw materials.  A number of discharges  are also  reported  from H.M. Dockyards at Chatham, Devonport and Pembroke Dock.     Shortage of Labour. The manager of&apos;the London (Central) Exchange for the Building Trades reports that the demand for bricklayers is still very great, his office having orders for about 2,000.   With regard to  carpenters, the number of vacancies  has been reduced and there  are  more men  registering for employment.  It  is  still difficult,  however,  to secure first-class joiners.   Many painters are unemployed, and great difficulty remarkable:ns in finding employment for general labourers; electricians&apos; mates and fitters&apos; mates.    The situation in the provinces, as regards skilled building labour,  remains  unchanged, but, notwithstanding the adverse conditions, progress continues to he made on numerous housing schemes.   An important scheme at Blyth has commenced which involves the con- struction of 2,000 houses,  with the necessary roads  and sewers.    The demand for skilled labour in certain trades still remains almost insatiable, and Exchange managers are frequently informed by employers that, with increased supplies of key workmen, employment could  immediately be found for other workers.  The skilled craftsmen mostly in demand are moulders of all types, coremakers, bricklayers, shipwrights, and coach and railway wagon builders.    Shortage of Materials and Fuel. Bedford report that Messrs. J.  &amp; F.  Howard have discharged  40 men from their foundry owing to a shortage of coke.  A shortage of cement is reported  from Torquay.  At Derby and Grantham the shortage of materials is retarding the absorption of labour in the engineering trade,  while  the same shortage, which is especially  acute as regards ship plates,  is reported from  the shipbuilding districts  of Aberdeen,  Greenock,  Sunderland,  Goole and  Scarborough. Women&apos;s Employment.    General Industrial Situation. The gradual decline  in activity in a large  number of staple industries which has now been reported for some weeks is beginning to show cumu-lative effect in the increase in the  live register of women applicants and in the decreasein the number of  vacancies notified.  No improvement is shown by the reports receivedfrom Exchanges this week.  It would appear that employers are taking  advantage ofthe holiday season to close their  works, and prolonged holidays indicate a prevailingindustrial depression.
    Local Reports. In the North-Western Division the cotton textile trade is reportedquiet owing to the holidays in many localities.   Nevertheless there is still considerable   ^activity in this industry, and  in many towns there is an unsatisfied demand for textileoperatives.  Slackness still continues to, be reported in the rubber and silk industries,in the hat trade, overall machining, and in the wire works.    From the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division it is reported that the area is on theverge of a serious trade depression, but that the effect is taking time to develop owing tothe previous trade boom.  The general  practice  is to work  short time rather than todischarge workers,  and increases in the numbers registering  have thus not yet takenplace on a large scale.  There is- a marked slackening in the labour demands of the woollen and worsted industry.  The clothing trade is depressed, the position in the boot and shoetrade is considered serious, and the  severe depression in the lace industry is enhanced bythe continued strike in the plain net section.    The  West Midlands Division report-trade holidays in practically all towns, and manyfactories  are stated to be working on short time,  or to  have  closed for the week.   Thetrades affected are the motor and allied trades in Wolverhampton and adjacent districts ;the jewellery trade in Birmingham  and the leather trades  at Stafford and Walsall.  Inthe Potteries works are closed for the summer holidays, and there  is slackness in the silkindustry  at Leek.    London again report industrial slackness in all factory areas, and add that the seasonaldepression in the needlework trades  is very marked and greater than usual.    The  textile  and clothing industries in Scotland are said  to be slack.  Considerableactivity is shown in  this division in recruiting  fruit pickers for  the  Auchterarder andBlairgowrie districts, but in other divisions the poor fruit crop has resulted in a smaller number of workers than usual  being employed.    Domestic Service. The industrial decline has had no material effect on the unsatisfieddemand in all domestic service occupations.  Local reports, however, vary, and it is felt,more  especially in the non-industrial divisions that, on the whole, the workers&apos; dispositiontowards this occupation is perhaps more  amenable than in the past.   Great efforts havebeen  made to fill seasonal vacancies, and generally employment in hotels and similarestablishments is viewed more favourably than private resident work.  Many  Londonapplicants  have  been induced to consider seasonal vacancies, and at Folkestone  these workers are stated to have given every satisfaction.  At Margate a number of untrainedgirls have been placed with employers who were at first unwilling to engage this type oflabour.  Waitresses have been sent from London as far as King&apos;s Lynn, Matlock, Harro-gate and Skegness.                         *    The  Bristol  Exchange have established a connection with Weston-super-Mare and asmall but steady supply of women  is being placed every week.  A number of women are also being migrated to Weymouth.  The shortage of workers is, however, said  to beacute, and much disappointment is caused by the large number who refuse to go forwardafter they have been engaged.    It is reported from the South Midlands and Eastern Division that Reading have been particularly successful in placing seasonal domestics in the hotels at Henley.  Ipswichhave persuaded some ex-Service women registered for clerical work, to take up domesticemployment, and a Women&apos;s  Legion motor driver has  been  placed as  a lady help;  a former member of the Women&apos;s Royal Air Force as a nurse help, and a clerk as a nurse.    The  North-Western Division report an improvement In the domestic service section,and  state  that   among  other domestic  placings three man-and-wife  vacancies  haverecently been filled, one at Warrington for the Lymm Grammar School.    The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division state that there is no diminution in the largeunsatisfied demand in all categories. Efforts are being made to establish a system of daily domestic helpers in the East Midlands. It is found that many of the daily workersafterwards take more kindly to the idea of living in.  Several instances have been reportedin which workers on short time have, with the  consent  of their employers, been sent toseasonal domestic vacancies.    The  Kendal  Exchange have found it possible, owing to an increased live register,to fill more local domestic vacancies than has  been the case for some time.  In theNewcastle area demands for cafe workers have been well met except as regards skilled cooks.Completed returns  show that approximately 700 workers were placed  at  the RoyalAgricultural Show  by the Darlington Exchange, of whom  nearly  200 workers  wereimported from other districts.
    Considerable improvement in the number of seasonal placings this year, as comparedwith last, is reported from Wales, and a visit of the woman officer from Colwyn Bay toExchanges  in the Birmingham area has produced good results.  The  South WalesExchanges  have sent a number of seasonal workers to Aberystwyth and  Llandudno.There is still, however, a large unsatisfied demand, and  lodging-house keepers state thatthey will have to put off their visitors if they cannot get assistance.    Scotland report that the special section established at Glasgow in connection withseasonal hotel work  has produced good  results, a large number  of  employers  havingentrusted the Exchange with the selection and engagement of staff  on their behalf.  TheInverness Exchange have supplied maids to practically every shooting lodge in the area.    Many Exchanges report that there are large  numbers of married women desirous of obtaining daily domestic work for  whom there is no demand.  These workers, in viewof their domestic ties, are not available for resident employment.                       LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.    Employment and  Resettlement. Some months  ago  the Woolwich Committee called attention to the fact that the occupation by the Royal.Air Force of the premises of theCharlton Rope Works was retarding resettlement in the area.  Representations have beenmade by the department from time to time to the authorities concerned, with the resultthat a part of the premises has been  cleared, and it was hoped that a  complete clearanceWould be effected by the middle of July.  The committee now  state that there are 18 baysstill in the occupation of the Air Force, and they press for a deputation to be receivedby the Secretary of State for War in the matter.    The Chelmsford Committee are pressing the Town Council to proceed with the. workof reclaiming foreshores, and of making the Chelmer Canal navigable for larger vessels.    The Dunfermline Committee have  been requested  by  a  large firm of London con-tractors to procure for them several warehouses for the  storage of metal purchased fromthe Admiralty.  It is hoped that over 100 men will be given  employment for more than six months.    It has been reported to the Newport Committee  that  numbers of  workpeople in regular employment  were engaged on other work in their spare time.  The committee feel that much of this spare time work could be done by men who  through their disable-ment were unable to  compete in  the  open labour market.   The  secretary is making further inquiries.    Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment&apos;Insurance. A suggestion has been receivedfrom  the Lewisham Committee that the  present  procedure  in  regard to the exchangeof unemployment books could be improved, and  arrangements  made whereby the sumstanding to the credit of each workman be certified to him each year, as is done under theNational Health Insurance Scheme.    The Redditch Committee have received a resolution from the Redditch and DistrictJoint Engineering Committee  calling attention  to the  length of time elapsing betweenthe date of making claims to unemployment benefit and the  date of decision in the caseof doubtful claims, and urging that  such claims should be settled in the district within three days.   The committee recommended that the procedure for settling doubtful claims to out-of-work donation should be made applicable  to doubtful unemployment benefitclaims or, alternatively, that the present procedure should be amended to ensure settle-ment within one week.    Training. Considerable progress continues to be made on  the training schemes.Loughborough report that a local firm of hosiery needle  manufacturers  are willing toaccept six disabled men as trainees in needle-making.  At Chelmsford a number of traineeshave  been placed with the  Essex  Agricultural Executive  Committee for training inmarket-gardening, pig-keeping and  poultry-farming.    Ex-Service Men. The  retention  of female labour/in cases where  disabled ex-Servicemen could be employed in  their place, continues to occupy the attention of a number of committees.  Chatham  calls attention to the discharge of disabled men from the localArmy Pay Corps offices, the engagement of fit ex-Service men in their place, and theretention of female labour.
  14.8.20                              244E tnployment Department-continued.    Acton point out-that the staff of the Hanwell War Pensions Committee still includes a  large number of women, and that the committee have failed to comply with theinstructions issued by the Ministry of Pensions.   The Newport Committee are of the opinionthat each case for substitution should be considered  on its merits.    Miscellaneous. More  committees have expressed regret at the Ministers decisionto discontinue  publication of The Month&apos;s Work.   Lewisham  are  of opinion that thepablication should be continued until the majority  of committees recommend otherwise.Great appreciation has been expressed of the work of the Darlington Exchange in con-nection with  the Royal Agricultural  Show held there recently.   Out of a total of 1,355vacancies notified in connection with the Show, 1,353 were filled by the Exchange.     OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Payments Made.    For return of the amounts paid upon out-of-work donation policies and in unemploy-ment insurance benefit  during the last week, see the report  of the Finance department under this heading on p.  253 below.Work of the  Courts of  Referees.    Out-of-Work Donation Appeal Cases (Great Britain). During the week ending the2i)th July, 1,281 cases  were referred  to appeals officers, 1,388 were heard by Courts ofRsferees,  and 1,221 cases  were  outstanding.    The total number of cases heard by appeals officers up to the 29th July  was 453,801.The total number  of cases heard by the Courts was 425,867.  An analysis of 413,084cases heard shows that 109,951 claims were allowed, 302,589  disallowed, and in 544 cases a compromise was  arranged.  The proportion  of disallowances to total claims heard was73-3 per cent.  Of the number disallowed 42-6 per cent, were cases of  refusal to acceptsuitable employment.    Out-of-Work Donation Appeal Cases (Ireland). During the week  ending the  29thJuly, 53 cases were heard by the Courts, and one dealt with by the appeals officers, makinga total  of  54 cases disposed of at 13 sittings.    The total number of cases heard  by the Courts up to the 29th July was 25,858.  an analysis of 24,720  cases heard shows that  7,512 claims were allowed, 17,108 disallowedand m 100 cases a compromise was arranged.  The proportion  of disallowances to totalclaims heard  was 69-2 per cent.  Of the number disallowed,  41-3 per cent, were cases ofrefusal to accept suitable  employment.    Unemployment Insurance Benefit Appeal  Cases (Great i?ntam).-During the weekending the 29th July, 111 cases were  heard by the Courts of  Referees and 150 cases wereoutstanding.    The total number of cases heard since the 14th July, 1919, up to the 29th July, 1920,was 4,705. An analysis of 4,461 cases heard shows that 1,358 were allowed and 3,102disallowed.  In the remaining case a compromise was effected.  The proportion of dis-allowances to total claims heard was 69-5 per cent.   Of the number disallowed, 34-9 percent, were  cases of the voluntary leaving of employment.    Unemployment Insurance Benefit Appeal Cases (Ireland). During the week ending the29th July, 12 cases were heard by the Courts of Referees.    The total number of cases heard up to the 29th July was 274.   An analysis of 262cases shows that 63 were allowed and 199  disallowed. The proportion of disallowancesto  total claims heard was 75-9 per cent.  Of the number disallowed 62-8 per cent,  werecases of the incidence of the trades  dispute  proviso.             DISCHARGED AND DISABLED  SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.    Up to the 4th August 19,074 certificates have been issued to  employers  enrolledunder the scheme.   These employers control staffs  amounting to 3,124,701  workpeople,and the undertaldngs signed by them covered 183,480 disabled ex-Service men.    Rsports as to the results obtained from the recent intensive canvass indicate widelyvarying success in different areas.   At a meeting  of the West Somerset  employment committees it was reported that 70 of the largest  employers  in their  area had been
canvassed, and that 23 undertakings had been received, and several others had promised togive the matter further consideration.   Employers who had net completed undertakingswere being approached again by letter or by a further personal interview.    The secretary of the  Loughborough  Employment Committee reported that the 42firms in the  area which  had been visited, 30 had given undertakings.  The secretaryof the Stafford Employment Committee reported that of the 13 main boot factories inthe area 12 had come into the scheme, and that 120 of the 140 undertakings which itwas estimated would be obtained had been received.  The only firm of boot manufacturersfrom whom an undertaking had not been obtained was visited personally by the chairmanof the sub-committee.    In  the area of  the Manchester Employment Committee, of the 4,161 employers towhom an appeal had been forwarded, 3,213 had not replied up to the 12th July.  In theOldham Employment Committee area there were on the 21st July only four firms whohad not given undertakings.    The minutes  of the meeting of the Edinburgh Employment Committee on the 21stJuly indicated that the builders&apos;, engineers&apos; and plumbers&apos;  associations had each agreedto receive deputations and had asked  for further information regarding the men.    The chairman of the  Ipswich Employment Committee, as Lord Lieutenant of theCounty, is arranging to circularise all employers in the county.Placings.    During the month ending  the 29th July, 37 disabled ex-Service men were placed inemployment in the  area of the Huddersfield Committee.    The Basingstoke Employment Committee report the  placing  of  a  disabled man,with a gun-shot wound in the left leg above the knee, as a tool runner in a local engineeringestablishment, and another suffering from a gun-shot wound in the head and shoulderas a temporary postman.    During the month ending the 22nd July, 19 disabled ex-Service men were placed inemployment by the Shepherd&apos;s Bush Committee, of whom  four were to be employed asnurse, salesman, switchboard attendant and doorman at a  cinema theatre.                              JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.    Co-operation with Farmers. At Worksop arrangements have been made by one ofthe members of the Juvenile Advisory Committee for the  manager of the Exchange to address  a meeting of local farmers  with a view to bringing the activities of the exchange and the committee more before their notice, and to encourage them to use the Exchange.It is not unlikely that boys will be forthcoming for suitable jobs in  farm work.    Unsatisfactory Vacancies.-The Leeds Committee, noticing that a certain firm  were constantly  applying for boys and that the boys placed with the firm  remained a  very short time, sent to  the employer to ascertain the reason.  It was found that the work was demoralising owing to its dirty and heavy nature, and it offered no prospects whatever.As the employers  were not disposed to do anything to improve  the conditions, the com-mittee decided that so long  as they could offer better openings, no further boys shouldbe submitted to the firm.  It is probable that members of  the committee will approach the firm again privately, and point out the need for improving the conditions of  employ-ment.    London Juvenile Advisory Committee. The London Juvenile  Advisory Committeehave been  considering  means  whereby the central committee  could  be  brought more closely in touch with the local committees.   It was felt that direct representation of all local committees on the central committee would only lead to  an unwieldy committee.At the same time the central committee recognised that the local committees sometimesfelt aggrieved that their views could not be supported by their own representatives at meetings of the central committee.  To meet the difficulty it was agreed to hold con-ferences, three  times a year,  between the  central committee and the  chairman andsecretaries of local committees.  Any subject which the local committees wished  to bring up could be  fully discussed  at these conferences.    Choice  of Employment (Derby). It was reported at the July meeting  of the DerbyJuvenile Employment Committee that 75  per cent, of the boys leaving school during the

In the hosiery andlace trades,  however,  although short time was being worked  by all firms, learners of14 years of age were still being engaged..  The explanation was stated to he that when there was little work, the teaching of learners gave employment to a few of the experiencedhands and ensured a trained staff when trade improved.    Apprenticeship  (Engineering). The question  of  apprenticeship in the engineering trades has recently  been engaging the attention of several Juvenile Employment Com-mittees.  The Bury Committee, as the result of a resolution received from their After-CareCommittee, have  appointed a  sub-committee  to endeavour to form an apprenticeshipscheme for the trade.  The Dewsbury Committee already have a draft scheme under con-sideration, and the Apprenticeship Committee of the Northampton Juvenile Advisory Com-mittee are proposing to convene  a  conference  of employers and workpeople to considerthe matter.  At Long Eaton, however, in view of the fact that a large number of firms in the trade do not  favour the establishment of an apprenticeship scheme, the JuvenileAdvisory Committee feel that further action at present  would be useless.  A  report presented to the Bolton Juvenile Advisory Committee at their last meeting shows thata large firm of textile machinists, in order to attract boys to their moulding department,have so revised the  rate of wages paid to apprentice moulders that  a boy of 13 years ofage can receive 24s. per week.

An  ex-officer began training in electrical engineering  with the Lancashire Dynamo and Motor  Co., Ltd.,  Manchester, in December last.  At first the members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by the firm refused to render him any assistance, although-they had no objection to his  presence in the shop.^ He continued in training without the  assistance  of  the  trade unionists  until recently, when strong objection was taken by them to his continuing, and it has been found necessary to withdraw the trainee from the firm.   The District Director is endeavouring to find him an alternative vacancy.     Reports from Directorates. The Director at Perth reports that the Dundee Business Club have agreed to form a panel similar to those formed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Clubs.  They have taken a room in the Dundee Town Hall at their own expense, and are most enthusiastic about the work.     In Manchester there are  signs of improvement in the building trade, and a number of vacancies  for architectural assistants have  been itotified.  Several of these could be traced to the issue to architects, surveyors and estate agents of a list of selected candidates. In Liverpool, however, when architects and surveyors were visited by canvassers it was found that there was no likelihood of immediate vacancies, and that  some architects were temporarily reducing  their staffs.  This  slackness was attributed-largely to house building being almost at a standstill.     In the Leeds  Directorate many firms report that the whole of their foreign orders have been cancelled and that, in consequence, they are having to cancel their purchases of raw materials and  close  down their  factories.  Very few  employers are working  niore than half  or quarter time,  and even this cannot last much longer.     A quick placing  is reported by the Hull  Sub-Office.  An ex-officer who  had failed- to obtain  employment in his native city decided to tramp the country in search of work. He arrived in Hull an hour or so before the time appointed for the Appointments Panel to sit, and arrangements were made for him to appear &quot;before it.   Within four hours of his arrival in Hull he was found an appointment.     The Director at Nottingham reports that, as  a result of  the special efforts which were  made with regard to disabled men, one firm in Nottingham  have now  asked for particulars of all disabled  ex-officers and men on the books,  and have promised to endeavour    The total number of cases dealt with to date by Interviewing Boards in the UnitedKingdom is 26,219./ Of these 22,048 have been recommended and 4,171 rejected.
Appointments  Department-continued.to fit them into their works.   Useful publicity at present is being obtained at local flowershows and agricultural shows.    The chairman of the Northampton Panel is offering to defray the expense of advertisingcandidates in the local paper for one month.    There is a marked depression in the shipbuilding trade in the Southampton area.    The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch, Ireland, reports that thepolicy of giving individual attention  to difficult cases and directly canvassing on behalfof these applicants is producing good results.  On various occasions firms have createdvacancies in order to assist the badly disabled.TRAINING   DEPARTMENT.  *                              EX-SERVICE  MEN. General.    Statistical. The weekly returns will be.discontinued during the month of August as, owing to the holidays, many of the  Instructional Centres will be closed for part of the time and the figures are likely to be  incomplete.    Employment of Factories on  Remunerative Work. Schemes for the employment of men in training in the building trades on the erection of houses under municipal housing schemes or otherwise are being developed in several divisions.   One such scheme recently put forward from the Leeds area is now being considered in detail at headquarters.  The Brighton Housing Committee are prepared to grant a contract to the Training Depart- ment for building some 40 houses, but a good many initial  difficulties, particularly in regard to the supply of materials, have to be surmounted.   An officer of the department is now to investigate the scheme in detail on  the spot.  Very good progress is being made with the houses at Erdington.  Two  of the four houses, on the erection of which men in training at the Garrison Lane Factory are engaged, will shortly be up to wall plate level, and the other pair is a few courses  above the damp course.  When this first  block is completed there will apparently be no difficulty in obtaining work on a  second similar block.    Commercial Course (Middlesex). A report received from  the Divisional Director inthe Middlesex area shows that exceedingly satisfactory work has been done by the studentsin the commercial class in the Hornsey Centre.  Nineteen men sat for the examinationof the Royal Society of Arts after seven months&apos; training.  Of these, 17 passed and eightwere awarded first-class certificates.  Of 12 students who sat for  the examination of theLondon Chamber of Commerce, nine passed, five with distinction.    Elementary Teachers. At  Sarisbury Court it has been necessary to obtain sanction for the appointment of three additional instructors in consequence of the increase in thenumber of students to 150.   There have been some  unfortunate  delays, due almost entirely to structural requirements, in starting this course.    Exhibitions. The  exhibit of the Forbesfield Factory at the Highland Show  has met  with marked success.   There were  specimens from the boot and shoe, tailoring,carpentry, cabinet-making and upholstery departments, and the  articles exhibited corn-pared well with those produced in the best workshops in Aberdeen.   Another part of theexhibit consisted mainly of articles of interest to the agricultural community, includingpoultry houses, chicken coops, dog kennels and the like.  Each exhibit could have been .sold  three times over.  A gratifying result  has been the receipt of orders for factoryproducts to the value of several &quot;hundred pounds.   Apart altogether from the financialside of the -venture, the exhibition will ke of great value in convincing country tradesmenand employers that men trained in the Government Factory are likely to prove efficientworkmen and that they are worth taking into employment either for the workshop periodof training or as  journeymen.
 Ex-Service Men-continued.     Hostels.-kt the beginning of July, 17 new schemes for hostels, canteens and mess- rooms, and for accommodation of residents in Government  Instructional Factories,  were under consideration.  Arrangements for messrooms at Derby, New Basford and Chiswick have been completed, and the residential factory  at Claydon has been opened.  On the 1st August the Ministry were responsible for carrying on 10 individual hostels, the group of hostels at Birtley, seven canteens and four messrooms.  In addition there are some 30 hostels and two canteens in various parts of the country carried on by voluntary and other agencies as to which questions occasionally arise for settlement by the Hostel Section.     Government Instructional Factories.-Each of the four  Scottish areas  has now  its own factory  at work, training having started, at present on a small scale, both at Dundee and Edinburgh during the week.  Marked progress has been made recently at the Cathcart and Forbesfield Factories.   At the former there are now  241 men in training compared with 124 in the corresponding week of last month.   There are now just under 500 men in training at Forbesfield, an increase of nearly 100 during the last month.  The factory has contracts in  hand to the amount of  2,010, and sales for the month of July were quite satisfactory.     The number in the Birtley and Walker Factories combined is now over 600, being an increase of about 150 since the 3rd July.  The  contracts  in hand at Birtley are to the value  of nearly  2,500, and  there have been fairly satisfactory returns from sales in  both factories during July.  The  plumbing  class at Walker recently visited the shipyard of Messrs. Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, Ltd., and after a visit to the works the men were taken over an Italian passenger boat which is being fitted up as one of  the most luxurious boats afloat.  The party were under the direction of the yard foreman plumber, the ship foreman plumber and his assistant, who gave detailed information of the work in hand.     Steady progress continues at the Sarisbury  Court  Factory  where there  are now 114 men in training,  75 on the industrial side.  A hairdressers  shop has been opened.  The training college section will, it is believed, be able  to start work at the beginning of  next. month.  The sales  for- the month of July were  quite satisfactory.     In view of the exceptionally  good equipment in the canteen at Ponders  End, the manager has proposed that a course of training for chefs shall form one of the features of the training scheme.     Equipment and Supplies. Central  Stores are now  well  supplied with boot and  shoe and wood-working  tools and tool  hags, and a large quantity of tool kits for all trades have been recently delivered. Treasury Sanctions.     The following  are among the most important of a number of proposals  that have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the  last Report.    Expenditure upon the partial equipment of the Ponders  End factory for 295 training places.    Expenditure upon equipment at St. James&apos;s Mill, Norwich,  for 388 training places.    &apos; Authority to rent from the Liverpool Education Committee  a portion of the Kirkdale Industrial School, and for expenditure upon internal cleaning down and external painting.    Authority to purchase the freehold  known as Nos. 761-763, Old Kent Road, S.E., to train disabled ex-Service men;  and the leasehold premises at  the rear of No. 769, Old Kent Road, at a price to be agreed by the Director-General of Lands Schemes Sanctioned.    During- the week 14 schemes, providing 430 places, have been sanctioned.   Includedin this number are 220 places for training in various branches of the engineering trade. Local Technical  Advisory Committees.    Tailoring.-Th.e first joint meeting of the Swindon Local Technical Advisory Com-mittee Was held on the 30th July.   It  was agreed to start  with a class of 10 men, the number to  be increased as opportunity  arises.    A  deputation  from the Oxford  Local  Technical Advisory Committee visited theCambridge Training Centre on the 22nd July.   In view of  the results  obtained by theCambridge  class,  Oxford have now agreed to extend their  course to include tuition  inmaking all garments, instead of only trousers and breeches.                     ,
                            WOMEN &apos;S  TRAINING.General.    Placings. Very satisfactory reports continue to be received on the placing in einploy-ment of the trainees whose classes terminated at the end of June, with the exception ofthose trained in dressmaking and tailoring, in which trades the usual seasonal  slacknessappears to be aggravated by the  general depression  in trade.    rJi1he demand for girls trained in the various branches of domestic work was far beyondthe supply.  The wages and conditions of employment offered showed how much domestic service has improved.  The prejudice against it amongst wage-earning women has slightlydiminished, though the demand for domestic training was never as great as was  hoped.War Widows and  Dependants.    Increase of Applications. The publication in the Press in the early part of  the week of the statement that the Ministry had fixed the 15th October as the last date for receivingapplications for training from war  widows has had a marked effect.  Many widows havemade personal or written application at headquarters.   In most cases the training desiredis of an industrial character, and there are also a few applications for professional or semi-professional courses.  Home  dressmaking is most  preferred as it enables the widow to look after her home and  children while supplementing her pension.   Should applicationsbecome sufficiently numerous it may be necessary  to start Ministry of Labour classes sothat the instruction may  be thorough and given on scientific lines.    New Schemes  Sanctioned. Sanction  has  been given to schemes- for training warwidows in  home dressmaking at Swansea and Pontypridd.   There will be 25 traineesin the former and  15 in the latter class.   There is a very considerable unsatisfied, demandfor  such workers, who should be able to make a good living.  The full number of traineeshas. been obtained in each case.    Statistical. During the week ending the 31st July, 17 new applications were received,bringing the  total to 2,493.  In 19 further cases  training  was authorised, bringing thetotal of sanctions to 1,399.   Twenty applications were rejected or withdrawn, and therewere three withdrawals from training.  In 15 cases training was completed.    At the end of the week there were 350 war widows in training, and 666 had completed their  training.                                                                    *    Since the transfer of training powers to the Ministry of Labour, on the 1st September,1919, 1,257 applications from war  widows have been  received.  During the same period672 have been sanctioned, and 774 have been rejected or  withdrawn.Disabled Nurses.    During the week ending  the 31st July, there were two fresh applications for trainingfrom  disabled nurses.  One of-them is anxious to obtain the Central Mid wives BoardCertificate  in order to take up a public  health post offered her in Canada.  The otherapplies for  a  course in chiropody  or massage.    Three  applicants have obtained sanction for courses in commercial correspondence,dispensing  and for training as a school matron.   For one of them the department  were able to obtain a small pension in  lieu of the gratuity which had been;granted, therebyrendering her eligible for the  assistance she required.    Of those who completed courses during the week one proved so successful in secretarialwork that  the principal  of the school has given her  temporary work at a good  salary.Another has successfully passed the examination of the Incorporated Society of TrainedMasseuses in medical electricity in spite of severe suffering caused by her disability.    Convalescent treatment during the holidays has been obtained from the Ministry ofPensions for a nurse training  as a dispenser who was in great need of rest after the term&apos;work.
                         APPRENTICES  AND  BOYS.                       INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS. Questions Affecting the Scheme.     Wages.-The fact that various references have been made to cases of low wages or of failure to pay the required rates to accepted apprentices does not justify any general deductions  regarding the  attitude of employers.   The numerical importance  of  such cases must  not be exaggerated.   There are many instances of generous payment by employers,  which do not,  like cases  of under-payment, involve administrative action, and it is probable that though they escape attention, they are at least as numerous.     The difficulties experienced in country  districts,  where trade  unionism, is  weak or non-existent, are well illustrated by a case from Lincolnshire.  The firm, who are motor car  repairers, and the apprentice alike failed to read the scheme, and its provisions  have throughout  been ignored.   The apprentice resumed training in February, 1919.  At this date the firm&apos;s most highly skilled man received about 42s. per week and has gradually been advanced to about 67s., whilst the apprenticed wages have risen during this period from  1  to  42s.  per week.   Thus, even if the low rates of the skilled men are taken as the standard, the arrears amount to  about   70.     Prescribed Rate. The Llandudno Garage paid an apprentice on the basis of a rate of Is. per hour,  whilst the lowest local rate for motor  mechanics appeared to be at  least Is. 6d. per hour for a 47-hour week.  The case was eventually referred to the Local Employ- ment Committee, who found that motor mechanics  in the district are paid  from Is. dd. to 2s.  id. per hour.   They unanimously recommended a prescribed rate of Is. 9d. per hour for the purposes of the scheme,  and urged the firm to adopt  this as their basis of payment.                                                          ...     In the jewellery trade of Swansea there appears to be no rate, and &quot; each employer has his own  views on the matter.&quot;  In one case, however, local headquarters have  induced an employer to  increase the very low rate which he was paying. The Scheme in Operation.    Statistics. Up to the 4th August, 41 schemes had been approved,  and  applications had  been received in respect of all of them.  The  number of  applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 26th July, was  275, making a total  of 42,625.   The number of  applications received from apprentices was 329, making a total  of 47,871.    Up to the 4th August, agreements had been received at  headquarters in respect of 40,868 apprentices.  Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 39,284 apprentices, employed by  15,613 employers.  Of these 14,075 were under the engineering scheme, and 6,521 under the building scheme.   The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agreement between the parties is now 8,363.    ApplicationsInformation received at local  headquarters  for  the South Midlands and Eastern area agsees with that received from other areas that many employers remain ignorant of  the  scheme&apos;s existence.  They instance  the case of a large firm of  painters and decorators with 11 returning apprentices.&apos;  In view of the near  approach of the  30th September,  they fear that  many  firms and apprentices will be left out of  the. scheme. They are approaching all the associations affected,  not only those of  employers and. work- people, but any  others whose assistance may be of value.   They are chiefly apprehensive however  in regard to the numerous non-associated firms, who cannot be reached in this way, and are thus more likely to be overlooked.    Acceptance or Non-acceptance.-Th.e effect of shortage of work in hindering the bringing of apprentices under the scheme is the subject of reports from the London and South- Eastern and the. South-Western areas.  The difficulty appears to  arise mainly in the engineering industry, but some similar cases arise in.other industries.  Local headquarters for the London and South-Eastern area fear that many of the apprentices will drift intounskilled labour. Local headquarters  for the South-Western area state that  many ofthe pre-war employers are altogether favourable to the scheme, but quite unable to employthe apprentices,  and  no others can be found for them.  At Portsmouth, however, thereare prospects of  providing for some of the apprentices  at the local school of  engineering,and the director of the school is being approached on the matter,
Apprentices and  Boys-continued,    In the West Midlands area a number of apprentices who could not find employershave now been provided for by the Austin Motor Co., Ltd.    Local headquarters for the West  Midlands area state that a number of engineeringapprentices have applied for admission under the scheme, and, upon obtaining employ-ment, usually through the activities,of this department, have backed  out, although inmost cases the employers are perfectly willing to enter into the agreement.  A managerof one Birmingham firm attributes this to the fact that the skilled journeyman is oftenrather jealous of a junior man, with little experience, drawing the same wage as himself,and that individual pressure is therefore brought to bear on the apprentice to refuse the privilege of the  scheme.    Local headquarters for the  Yorkshire and  East Midlands area draw attention to theextreme difficulty of finding employers for apprentices to motor engineering when their pre-war firms cannot reinstate them.   They quote as a typical case that of an apprenticewho applied last year to come under the scheme, but has not found an employer in spiteof very great efforts on his behalf by the Local Employment Committee.   He has recentlysecured temporary work as a fitter with a firm ot sanitary engineers, but they refuse tobring him under  the scheme owing to his lack of experience in this line.   He has now decided to emigrate.    Non-Observance of Conditions. The cases reported are concerned mainly with refusalsto pay the proper wages and objections to  advancing the State grant, and the successof local headquarters m dealing with the firms concerned has varied.  At  Newcastle-on-Tyne, Messrs. Sopwith &amp; Co., Ltd., furniture manufacturers, who had not been makingthe proper payments, promised in April to adjust matters.  Further complaint was maderecently by an apprentice, and investigation showed that, owing to changes in the manage-ment, the matter had been neglected.  A further promise to rectify matters has now beengiven.   Similarly a firm of printers in this area promised to  make up the payments totheir proper figure, but after further complaints it was found that the apprentice had signedfor the  full payments but had  only received the managing director&apos;s I.O.U.    Training in Operation: Progress. In addition to the  areas  referred  to last week,the West Midlands and the Northern areas have forwarded favourable reports.  A recentinspection of training in the printing industry at Coventry showed the firms visited to be unanimous in their appreciation of the scheme.    At Kendal the trade unions are so gratified with the handling of cases under the scheme by their representative that they have created a special appointment for him,  and localheadquarters report thai every case which he has put  before them has been  amicablysettled.    A report from local headquarters for the North-Western area draws attention to thegenerally unsatisfactory conditions of training in the motor car repairing industry, and thusconfirms the experience  of the South-Western area headquarters.  They  write that inmany garages and repair shops the workshop training is of a very low order;  This is trueespecially of the small  works, for in  such establishments the variety of  work is oftenmeagre, there is insufficient equipment, there are no special training arrangements, andthe apprentice is looked upon as a producer and not as a learner.                              GENERAL TRAINING.Boy Superintendence.    Appointment of Superintendents. During the week ending the 31st July one superin-tendent was appointed.Apprentices : Conditions and Training.     4    Conditions of Training (Printing). A firm of printers in the North-Western areaconsider that there are  two chief hindrances to an all-round training.  First, the hustleand competition of modern industry often cause such training to involve  financial loss,since the apprentices  are continaully learning  new work and so are of little value, andmust at the same time receive a good wage to  induce them to enter the industry.  Further,the workmen in charge of them lose a good deal of time.  Such loss in the past was com-pensated by a premium, but such payments have now practically ceased.  Secondly,apprentices, if not bound, are apt to leave an employer after three or four years, when theyare becoming useful, to go elsewhere as improvers at higher wages.
Apprentices and Boys-continued.    The firm propose, as remedies, that qualifying examinations be instituted ;  that allfirms be compelled to give proper training;  that no employer engage another firm&apos;sapprentice without their  consent;  and that a State subsidy be paid for each apprenticetrained in accordance with Government requirements.    Motor Engineering (Liverpool). The opinion is reported to be held locally, that, owingto the growth of the motor industry, the whole question of training needs consideration in regard both to mechanics and chauffeurs.  The latter, for instance, it is held, shouldbe thoroughly trained both to drive and maintain a car.  It is suggested that a school ofautomobile engineering could undertake all grades of training, from that of the mechanicto that of the highly technical engineer.    Excess of Apprentices :  Boilermakers (Mersey  District). The Amalgamated  Unionof Shipbuilding Engineering and  Constructional  Workers have  instructed their branchsecretaries to collect full information upon all matters concerned with apprentices andapprentice training.  In the Mersey area the district secretary is disturbed at the resultof his inquiries, and at the very high proportions  of apprentices which they show.  their numbers in his view are  often such as  to prevent the boys obtaining a proper training and to render their employment a blind alley.  In this connection it may be noted thatat Chelmsford the local secretary of the engineering union considers that the industry inthe district is overcrowded, and that therefore boys should be discouraged from enteringit.

INDUSTRIES  DEPARTMENT.                   INDUSTRIAL  COUNCILS  DIVISION.              JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS:  REPORTS.Industrial.    Coir Mat and Matting. The Council met on the 29th July.  Reports were receivedfrom the districts that agreements had been arrived at with the workers.  The majorityof firms are adjusting piece-rates to give the normal worker Is. 5\d. and 9\d. per hour inthe case of men and women, respectively.  It was agreed to approach the institutions forthe blind  whose members are engaged in the manufacture of coir mats, with a view toarranging a conference between representatives of&apos; the institutions and of the Council to fix rates for blind workers.    The  question of the  importation of Indian mats, and of duties imposed by nativeStates  on the export of coir fibre and yarns was discussed, and it was agreed to send adeputation to the India Office to protest against such duties.    The  Council recommended all firms in the industry who had not already done so togrant all Workers of six months&apos; service and over six days&apos; holiday on full pay.    The  Council also decided to ask the liaison officer with the Board of Education toattend their next meeting to discuss what steps could  be taken to improve the health and education of juvenile workers.    Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading  Services,  Manual  Workers (England and  Wales). The first meeting of the District Council for Essex, Hertfordshire and Middlesex was heldon the 30th July.   The Essex and Hertfordshire  County Councils have decided not toparticipate in the Council, and the action of the  Hertfordshire County Council appearsto have been followed by almost all the local authorities in that county.   It was decidedthat the Council should proceed.  Officers  were elected and an  executive committee  wasappointed with instructions to consider at once the wages claims referred to  the DistrictCouncil by several local authorities,  and also to collect information respecting  grades of work people and existing conditions of employment within the area.    The District Council for the Eastern Division met on the 5th August when the questionof minimum rates of wages for general labourers was discussed.  No agreement  wasreached, and it was decided to refer the matter to the National Council.    Paint, Colour and Varnish-kn extraordinary meeting of  the Council was held onthe 6th August to consider the application made by the workers&apos; side for an advance of10s.  After prolonged negotiations the  workers&apos;  side  decided to recommend to their members the acceptance of the offer made by the  employers for a general increase of 5s.for men over 21, making the minimum  rate  68s.;  a general advance of.2s. for womenover 21 ;  and proportionate advances for men and women under 21 ; the advances to date from the  1st August.    Tin  Mining. The Council met  on the  3rd August.  It was reported  that  thedeputation to Sir Robert Home asking  for State  assistance to the tin mining industry had met  with the unqualified refusal of the Board of Trade to assist in any way.   no fresh proposals for dealing with the situation were  put forward,  except that the workers&apos;side suggested that the State should acquire all the mines and run them as a State enterprise.This suggestion will be discussed at the next meeting on the 27th August.    Tramways. The Standing Committee of the Tramways Council, met oh the 29th July,and settled a number of questions of interpretation arising out of the application of thetramways agreement of March, 1919.    Waterworks Undertaking. The  Grading and Basic Rates Committee of the eastern counties District Council  met on the 4th August.   Agreement was reached on a numberof general considerations affecting grading and wages, but the committee were unable toarrive at a decision upon actual wages, and it was decided to  refer the question of theappropriate minimum rates for general labourers to the District Counpil.    Wool  (and Allied) Textile. The meeting of  the Council held  on the 7th July toconsider the wages agreement to come into force after the 31st July, resulted in a deadlock,and the Council was  adjourned sine  die, leaving  to either side the option  of calling afurther meeting in  accordance with the constitution.  As  the result of informal conver-sations with representatives of each  side at  the Ministry on the 27th July,  a further
    [References to matter of interest in connection with Industrial Councils will also be found on pages 234 and 258.]meeting of the Council was held on the 5th August.  The operatives reported that the ballot of their constituents which had been taken in accordance with the constitutions ofthe various unions, had resulted in a large majority against the employers&apos; offer of anagreement  for one year, embodying an advance  of  26j per  cent, on basic rates  withproportionate  advances to piece-workers.  The conference on the  5th  August lastedtwelve hours with frequent and prolonged adjournments.  The operatives, after a generalcriticism of the inadequacy of the employers&apos; offer, submitted detailed criticisms as to theinequality of the treatment accorded to piece-workers, who were offered advances varying from 18 per cent, to 23 per cent, as compared with the 26f per cent, offered to time-workers ;the necessity for levelling up the basic rates of certain  workers, scheduled  in Clause 14of Award No. 249 of the Interim Court of Arbitration, which vary from Qd. to %\d and Q\d.per hour for  comparable work in the different districts ; and  as to  the making of anagreement  for one year during a period  of  marked depression.  The employers offered to pay the same rate  of increase to piece-workers  as  they  had previously offered totime-workers,  and to consider an  agreement which should remain in  operation until the31st May, 1921. After a prolonged adjournment the operatives reported that they couldnot reach a decision that night, and the meeting  was adjourned until the 6th August.On resumption the operatives offered further criticisms of  the employers&apos; proposals,directing attention  to  the fact that no  special concessions had been offered to time-workers.    The inability of the -employers to  make  any  concessions to this class  of  operativecreated a very delicate position, and after six hours the meeting was adjourned in orderthat the operatives might have an opportunity of  considering the proposals at a special meeting of the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trades which was to be heldon the 7th August.    It is now understood that at  the meeting of the association it was, resolved that theemployers&apos; amended proposals should be accepted, and that  this  course  should  be recommended  to the constituent unions.   Unless, therefore, difficulties occur at the last moment, it seems extremely probable that an agreement on the lines of the discussion willbe reached shortly.        JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS :  WORKS COMMITTEES.    Flour  Milling. Inquiries have been  continued in the Manchester  district,  andarrangements  made for a meeting of the District Council to consider the establishment ofworks committees.  In the London district an investigation has been made of the workscommittee at  the works of Messrs. Chas. Brown &amp; Co.,  Ltd., Croydon, who stated theywould be pleased to answer  any inquiries from other firms.  The committee have been most  successful in regulating meal hours, establishing a mess room and improving working conditions generally.    Pottery. Particulars have been obtained of the work of  a number of the workscommittees recently established.  In one case the  employee members were  able to showthat part of the flooring and a staircase were unsafe, and that the lighting and ventilationwere unsatisfactory ; and the management side of the committee agreed that  these matters should be attended to at once,  At another works, the committee investigated complaintsas to the clay in use, and suggested a number of improvements which were satisfactorilyadopted.   In  another  case  the  employees  recommended the installation of certainmachinery which was  provided,  with  excellent results.  This committee have been inexistence  three months, and the  management, who at first had grave doubts as to theutility of the Committee, now state that they are exceedingly pleased with the work done.        INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES:  REPORTS.    Paper Making.-The prospects of a Council for the industry have been discussed withthe secretary  of the Paper Makers&apos; Association.  It appears  that steps are being  takenindependently of the Ministry to form  a Council on which the general labour  unionswill not be given representation.

For all overtime on Saturday,       time-and-a-half, and for all time worked on  Sunday and  customary public and statutory holidays,       double time.           Workers employed on piece-work  shall receive in respect of each hour of overtime worked,  in       addition  to piece-rates, each  of which  would yield in the circumstances of the case to an ordinary       worker not less than the piece-work basis time-rate applicable, in  the case of workers, other than       learners,  the whole, one-half, or one-quarter of the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate, and,  in       the cases of learners the whole, one-half, or one-quarter of the  appropriate general minimum time-       rate, according as the overtime rate payable, if the worker had been employed on time-work, is double       time, time-and-a-half, or time-and-a-quarter, respectively.

WAGES  AND   ARBITRATION   DEPARTMENT.                                    AWARDS.    The number of awards issued during the week was ten, seven under the industrial courts Act, one under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, as modified by theIndustrial Courts Act, and two by single arbitrators.Industrial  Court.    Railway Wagon Builders  and Repairers (National). The Court considered  that theevidence did not show any advance in the prosperity of the industry since the date onwhich the last advance was given, and that the  position to-day does not differ materiallyfrom that prevailing  in April,  1920, the date of the previous hearing.  They  found,accordingly, that the  claims  for  advances in wages had not been  established.   (AwardNo. 424.)    Engineers and Joiners (Glasgow). The Court decided  that the  movements  of thewages of joiners and engineers employed by the Dalmellington Iron Co.,  Ltd., should be regulated  by the advances and reductions applicable to their  respective trades  in theAyrshire district.  (Award No. 425.)    Singer  Manufacturing  Co.,  Ltd.  (Clydebank). In  defining  the   prescribed  andsubstituted rates for the women and girls concerned, the Courts held  that the firm&apos;sestablishment was an  engineering shop within Award No. 174  of the Interim Court  ofArbitration as extended by Order 260  of 1919.   (Award No.  428.)    Engineering and Foundry Trades. Two interpretations were given with regard to theapplication of the advance under Award No. 180 to piece-work  prices for members of theNational Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers; one for gas meter making, andthe other for sheet-metal work in Coventry.  (Award No. 438.)Single Arbitrator.    Engineers&apos; Labourers in Breweries (London). The arbitrator, giving an interpretation of an agreement between two unions and certain London brewers, decided that engineers&apos;labourers should be paid as inside workers within the terms of the agreement,  and werenot entitled to the rate of pay for labourers in the general engineering trade.                       AGREEMENTS  AND  SETTLEMENTS.    Corporation Workers  (Dover). In reply to  the application  of the National Amalga-mated Workers&apos; Union* for the adoption of Awards Nos. 84 and 101  of the Civil ServiceArbitration Board, the Corporation have decided that Award No. 84  be applied as fromthe 17th November,  1919, that Award No. 101 be  applied as from the 1st June, 1920,and that,  as the union have agreed that no further  application for bonuses shall be sub-mitted, the principle of the sliding scale provided for in the latest Civil Service Award shallbe applied, on the basis of Award No. 101, the first revision to date as from the 1st July.                       INTERPRETATIONS  AND RULINGS.    Rivalry of  Trade Unions. An appeal against the judgment of Mr.  Justice Astburyin the case of White versus Riley and Woodf was heard before the Master of the Rolls,Lord Justice Warrington and Lord Justice Younger, and allowed.  In the course of his judgment, the Master of the Rolls said that there was no act amounting to a threat apartfrom the letters and the refusal to withdraw it, nor was there any evidence by the defen-dants from which any threat  or intimidation could  be  inferred.   It was clear that the mere statement of  a number of workmen that they would not work with a certain otherworkman  was not by itself actionable.   Men had a right to refuse to work with a man and to tell the  employer what they proposed to do.  He could find nothing more in thepresent case than the statement.made to the employers that if the plaintiff did not join the curriers&apos; society they would not  work with him, whereon the master dismissed theplaintiff rather than have his whole  business upset.  That statement in itself was notactionable.(B 16348)* See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 788.t See this Report, No. 15, 8th May, p.  518.
                  QUESTIONS PENDING AND  MISCELLANEOUS.    Warehousemen (Liverpool). Arising out  of the recent agreement by which Liverpoolprovision warehousemen obtained the dockers&apos; rate of 16s. per day, a dispute has arisen between  Messrs. Ridgways,  Ltd.,  and the National &quot;Warehouse and  General Workers&apos;Union.  The firm contend that as they are not wholesale merchants, but simply supplytheir own retail shops, they do not come within the scope of the agreement.   They have offered to have their case submitted to the Industrial Court, but the union will not agreeto this course,  their  contention  being that the  matter should  be referred  to the negotiating Committee set up under Lord Shaw&apos;s Report.  The Chief Conciliation Officer,Manchester, is in close touch with the parties, but it is thought that a strike is inevitable.    Lace  Workers  (Nottingham). A  threatened strike of lace workers, members  of theFemale Embroidery Workers&apos; Association,  employed by Messrs. Balm, Hill &amp; Sons, Ltd.,Nottingham, has been reported by the Chief Conciliation Officer.   The dispute arose onthe question of  the  adoption of the prices  agreement drawn  up by  the NottinghamEmbroidery Workers&apos; Association and the  Female  Embroidery  Workers&apos; Association,the firm contending that the agreement was drawn up without reference to them, and thatthey use a special machine which is  not used by other manufacturers.  The manager ofthe firm has promised to interview the union secretary, provided that he speaks  as thedelegated spokesman of the women concerned and not as secretary of a trade union.  this offer has been communicated to the union.    Painters (Finchley). A dispute between the building trade unions and the FinchleyUrban District Council has  arisen  owing to the painters  employed in  painting anddecorating the schools not receiving the recognised district rates.  The firm who hold the contract, it  appears,  undertook to  pay the recognised rate, which the union  claim  to bethe London rate.  Various rates  were paid  to the painters  employed, and  the highestamounted to Is. 9d. per hour.  At  a conference between the  Council and the unions concerned, at which the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, was present, it was decided thatthe Council should give consideration to the matter.    Shop Assistants (London). The Workers&apos; Union have informed the department thatMessrs. Lipton, Ltd., are prepared to proceed to arbitration on the  union&apos;s claim forincreased wages.  This statement is  being investigated by the Chief Conciliation Officerwith a view to the submission of joint terms of reference.    Gas  Workers (Cheltenham). The Cheltenham Gas Light  &amp; Coke Co., having  with-drawn from the  Federation of Gas Employers, have refused to comply with the  recentnational agreement, and are desirous of having the case of their undertaking submittedto the Industrial Court on its own merits.   The Gas,  Municipal  and General Workers&apos;Union refuse to accept this line of action, and to enforce their demand for the operationof the terms of the national settlement, 250  men came  out on strike on  the 24th July.The company state that  under present conditions they cannot afford to increase wages,as, until their charges are raised, the business  is running at a loss.  The Chief Con-ciliation Officer is  in touch  with both parties, but  the company refuse to alter theirattitude, stating that they regard the works as closed down indefinitely.    Hairdressers (Manchester). The  National Amalgamated Union of  Shop Assistants,Warehousemen and  Clerks  made an  application in June  for  the adoption of  theirschedule for wages and  conditions  of  employment  for the  hairdressing trade,  which provides for apprentice wages  ranging from 24s. to 40s., according to  service,  and  aminimum of  3 10s. for journeymen.  The masters refused, the application but arranged to meet the union representatives on the 26th July.   Owing to the failure of the mastersto carry out this arrangement, the union decided that unless a  meeting was held in theimmediate future,  they would consider the  question of handing in notices.  The ChiefConciliation  Officer was  able  to persuade the  masters to  meet  a deputation of the employees, but they refused to treat with two of the work peoples&apos; chosen representatives,on account  of their participation in a former dispute.  A stoppage of work, therefore,took place on the 6th August.    Electrical Workers (Liverpool).-Owmg to the refusal  of  the  Liverpool corporation to meet the union, except through the Joint Industrial&apos;Council, the  Chief  ConciliationOfficer has not been able to arrange the proposed conference.  The matter is to be brought before the District Council on the 10th August, and the Chief Conciliation Officer has been instructed to await the result of this meeting.

APPENDIX.                         QUESTIONS  IN  PARLIAMENT.     The following extract from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relates to questions in which the Ministry is interested. Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918.     Mr. Gwynne asked the Prime  Minister,  in  view of the  expiration, on the  30th September next, of the Temporary Wages Act,  1918, as continued by the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, will he state whether the Government has yet decided on any policy to meet the situation which will then arise ?     Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to reply to  this question.   It is not proposed to continue the  operation of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918,  beyond the 30th September next.  That  Act was designed to meet the situation arising after the Armistice.   It was continued in  May, 1919, and  again by the Industrial Courts Act in November, 1919, with the  concurrence of representative associations of employers and workpeople, but the Act has now  served its purpose.  In most industries  permanent arrangements for the settlement of wages have been reached.  In unorganised industries a considerable number of Trade Boards have been set up.     Mr. Gwynne: Will the right, hon. gentleman say whether the Government  have decided on any policy ?     Dr. Macnamara: In the part of my answer where I spoke of the setting up of machinery. for arriving at agreements between employers and employed, part of the field is covered. For the rest, the wide development of the Trade Board policy comes in.  For that reason we do not propose to re-enact the Act.-(4th August.)
