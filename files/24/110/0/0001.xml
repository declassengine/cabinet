(Clrcrrlalrcfc Tor  information).     The Secretary-General has the honour to forwardherewith for the information of the Members of the Councilof the League of Nations * copy of a letter dated 6th June1920, from Sir Reginald rT&apos;ower, High Commissioner of theLeague of Nations at Danzig, dealing with the position of$16 League of Nations with regard to the Free City of Danzigin case of,war, after the Free City has been established and placed under the protection of the League.     The protection of the Free City of Danzig by theLeague of Nations is provided for by Article 102 of theTreaty of Versailles, in. the following terms; -&apos;.            &quot;The principal Allied and Associated Powers        undertake to establish the town of Danzig, together      .... with the rest of the territory described in Article        100, as a Free City.   It &quot;will be.placed under the        protection of the League of Nations.&quot;     The question,--of undertaking this protection willprobably not come before the Council of the League ofNations until the Constitution of the Free City, underArticle 10(5 of the Treaty of Versailles, has been prepared&apos;,and the Treaty between the Principal Allied Powers and poland, under Article 104 of the same Treaty, is signed.
    NO. 95.                      ALLIED ADMINISTRATION,                                                DINZIG,                                        6th June, 1920,Sir1&quot;,     In an interview&apos;given to the representative of the berlin Borsen Zeitung, a few days ago, Monsieur Biesiadeckl,the Polish Commissioner General at Danzig, made the followingobservationi-          &quot;The conclusion of the Treaty between Ptland and       Danzig offers certain difficulties in consequence of       differenced in Interpretation by the two parties       concerned,   Tfte most important point for us Poles       is the harbour,   Poland relies on the right       conferred upon her by Article 104(4) for the development       and improvement of the harbour and other works-, and       bases her claim thereon for the administration of the       pjqgbi-  Should the administration be left solely In       the hands of the Danzigers&apos;&apos;, P*land would have no       freedom of movement,   Thfe.Danzlg.ers could, fyr example -       if ^ we were at war with &quot;a tliird j^ower - close the port&quot;       for these purposes&apos;,   fee harbour serves both&apos; peoples;       /obligations&apos; arid rights can only be divided by a key       which shall conform to the needs of both parties alike1.       The key is quite easy to find.   Take the population of       the&apos; two States.   Danzig has about 300,000 Inhabitants,       and Poland about 30,000,000,   In this proportion we       ask for the division of all rights and duties in the       port, including the administration,&quot;     The point to which I wish to call the attention of -theCouncil of the League of Nations is that which I have underlinedabove.     If Poland sees  ground for apprehending that in time ofwar Danzig might close the port to Polish vessels, does not thesame  contingency arise that, in time  of war between Poland and a third  Power, Poland  might close the Port by  force?     In either case, what would be the position  of the Leagueof Nations, under whose protection the Free  City is to beplaceA?                     I have the honour to be, Sir,                        Your most  obedient humble  servant,                             (Signed)  REGINALD TOTTER.The Honourable Sir Eric&apos;Driimmcnd, K,C.M,G,, C,B,,            Sunderland House,                Curzon.Street, London, W,
