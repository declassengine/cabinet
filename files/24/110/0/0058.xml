This  document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.30GSECRET.THE CABINET.                                 *SGAS  WARFARE.MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOB WAB.    I circulate herewith a note which has been prepared in the War Office on the Gas   0153Warfare Organization of the United States Army.                                     4773                                                                    W. S. C.  THE  WAR OFFICE,         7th August, 1920.     1. In a memorandum (CP. 1211),  dated 3rd May,  1920, and circulated  to theCabinet, it was stated that the Americans  had voted 26,000,000?. for gas warfare andhad actually spent half this sum in one year.     These figures seemed very large and were accordingly only put before the cabinet after having been  queried and confirmed, but as  a result of further enquiries it now appears that the facts were as follows :      Late in 1918 a sum of 100,000,000 dollars (26,000,000/.) was apparently allotted  togas  services.  A further  225,000,000  dollars was transferred from  Ordnance and medical Services to be  employed  in building arsenals, laboratories,  &amp;c.   Of this325,000,000 dollars about  285,000,000 have been  refunded  to the Treasury.  Of theremainder, considerably more than 20,000,000 was expended on building operations  atEdge wood Arsenal and in the purchase  of  materials.  It is  believed that altogetherabout 25,000,000 dollars have actually been  spent on Edge wood Arsenal.     A sum of 2,000,000  dollars has been  allotted by Appropriation Act for chemical warfare in 1921, and  General Fries (the new Chief  of the  Chemical Warfare  Services)explains that 2,500,000 dollars in cash and  3,500,000 dollars worth of newly boughtstocks of chemicals and equipment will also be carried forward from the present year.In 1921 the Americans should therefore have at  their disposal for chemical warfareservices a sum of 4,500,000 dollars in cash and 3,500,000 in kind.     General Sibert, the former Chief of the Chemical Warfare Services,  supplied theearlier figures and General Fries the latter. It is probable that both sets of figures in turnrepresented the facts as far as Generals Sibert and Fries respectively knew them at thetime, but in any case the fulness and reliability of information from Military Attachesnecessarily depends very largely on the courtesy and accuracy of foreign officials.     The original statement in  paragraph 3 of CP. 1211  should therefore be amended to read as follows :      &quot; The Americans voted 26,000,000/. for  gas  warfare and appear actually to have spent at least a quarter of this sum  since the war; the actual cash available for 1921will apparently be  about 1,000,000/.     We  ourselves hope to obtain  Treasury sanction for the expenditure of a sum of72,000/. (includes  approximately  20,000/.  for works services) which,  together withcontributions from the Admiralty and Air Ministry, should amount to nearly 100,000/.in all.&quot;     2. The following facts may also be of interest  :-     (a.)  The authorized Peace Establishment of the American Chemical War Services           is  100 officers  and 1,200 other ranks:  We have  as yet no authorized           Peace  Establishement,  but  hope eventually  to  get sanction   for   a           corresponding  establishment of about 21  officers and 209  other  ranks           (includes Naval and Royal Air Force personnel).             -   In addition the Americans are,  we believe, employing  about  1,400           civilians as compared with less than 300 in  our case;  on our side most  of           the civilians are women employed on salvage work.     (h.) The  Americans  are  maintaining  at Edge wood Arsenal  plants  capable  of           producing 250 tons of gas daily, whereas we only have plant sufficient  to           yield 10 tons daily.

    3. The two following quotations from American publications help one to realize theattitude of responsible American officials.         (i.) &quot; The reproach of cruelty and perfidy addressed against  these supposed    shells  (i.e., gas  shell)  was  equally  uttered  previously  against firearms and    torpedoes, although  both are now employed without scruple.   It  is illogical and    not demonstrably humane  to  be tender about asphyxiating men  with gas, when    all are prepared to admit that it is allowable to blow the bottom out of an ironclad    at  midnight,  throwing  400  or 500  men  into  the  sea  to  be  choked  by  the    water, with scarcely the remotest chance to  escape,&quot;  (Quotation from Admiral    Mahan, one of the United States of America delegates at the Hague Conference in    1899, who gave this as the reason why the United  States of America could not    agree to deny themselves the use of gas in shells; it was requoted in. &quot; America&apos;s    Munitions &quot; (official history of America&apos;s munitions) by the Assistant Secretary, the    Director of Munitions).         (ii.) &quot;As to poison gas, we would as well accustom ourselves  to the thought    that it is now a permanent andximportant part of war.  To get hot about that is    as futile as to scold the men who invented gunpowder, and is on the  same plane.    It is ridiculous to declaim about the incidentals of war while ignoring the  truth    that war itself  is the enemy.  If America ever again &apos; draws the sword,&apos; to use an    expression that shows the difference between war of yesterday  and war of to-day,    America will go  in with as much reliance on gas  shells  as her  antagonist  can    possibly have.  Nobody  in the military councils  at Washington  or West  Point    ever dreams of anything else.  And if America does  not add a few refinements to    the use of gas it will be because American wit and ingenuity have broken down,    which isn&apos;t likely.&quot;   (Extract  from Des Moines Register  of 22nd March,  1920,    quoted by General Fries, the Chief  of  America&apos;s  Chemical Warfare Services, who    in repeating it stated that it &quot; probably expresses about as well as  any words I    have yet seen the position that I believe the average man  in the United States    takes regarding chemical warfare.&quot;)
