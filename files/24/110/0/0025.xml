He4 This  Document  is the&quot;^rtp tjfjrf-I is Britannic Maje&apos;sty&apos;s Government.           From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 30th July 1920.                                 (Received 9 p.m.)     Clear the line.     957 S.   Your telegram of 29th  July,  P. 5700 Secret.   Afghanistan.   Afghandelegates crossed the frontier 29th  July.  Despatch of letter to  Amir  now  seemsurgently necessary as Amir will naturally  expect courtesy communication  from meimmediately on return of delegation.  I deprecate substitution of sentence  which you suggest as  it would probably be interpreted as intention on our part to impose furtherprobationary period.  This, as shown&apos; in my telegram of 19th J une, 759 S., would be unwise, and I understand  from  your telegram of 29th June that.you have  accepted this view.  Early conclusion of treaty of friendship with Afghanistan seems from ourstandpoint  more necessary than before, owing to general ^deterioration of situation in middle East, although prospect of &quot;reliable Soviet undertaking to abstain from intriguein that direction  may be (corrupt group)er than our  present information indicates.Written  statement of basis of treaty of friendship was communicated to  Afghans atfinal meeting of Conference as reported in our telegram of 26th;July, 933  S.  Termsfollow in separate telegram.; you will note that they are in accordance with&quot; authority given in  your telegrams of 24th June, 29th June and 6th July   With, regard to yoursuggestion   that attempt  should  be made  to  prevent  Afghanistan: obtaining.:simultaneous treaty and subsidy from Bolsheviks,  we could hardly expect Afghans to abstain from treaties with them to provide for normal  relations and. intercourse, but of course any understanding aimed against us would entail breach with us,  and Dobbshas  in   constantly  repeated  statements  made  this  perfectly  plain.   Authenticinformation seen by you shows that  so  far  Bolsheviks  have no intention of givingsubsidy for other help except  in-return  for  Afghan promise to facilitate-measureshostile to us.  Therefore if  Afghans, as  is clearly stipulated in written  statement,undertake in return for our assistance to prevent such measures, idea of valuable.help.;of subsidy is ipso facto precluded,   f  hope you will  how urgently authorise despatchof letter to Amir.                            ]
