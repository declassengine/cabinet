&apos;   ,)0CUfltett* b ?!ic  Pi openly  Ct     ;fi?^M IvUfoafrfe Government,y the Secretary of State for India,    I think this proposal is deserving of urgent consideration.   If possible, with due regard to French  susceptibilities,  it would provide us with an Emir, and show our good faith to an ally in misfortune.                                                                     E. S.  M.2nd August 1920.           Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 31st July 1920.     9249.  Your telegram of the 30th July intimating FeisaFs  departure by orderof the French to Deraa, in British sphere.   As seen from Baghdad this may mean oneof two things: he may be on his way back  to Hedjaz, or he  may be  intending  toremain in that part of Syria  under British iniluenee.   If he remains at  Deraa  and still claims to be  King of Syria he will gather round him a considerable  number  ofhis former officials and will be constant source of trouble  to the  French, but if hewithdraws his claims to Syria and only claims paramountcy in Palestine his presencewill make things  very hard for French  and will put us in  a  very difficult  positionsince we can scarcely take up definite line against him in view of decision  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government referred to in your telegram of 20th July, P. 5598.     Will His Majesty&apos;s Government  consider  possibility of offering, him Amirate  ofMesopotamia?  Objections entertained  on this side to Amir have hitherto beenprimarily that no suitable person could be found.   We  have always regarded  Feisalas booked for Syria.  Nothing that I have heard during  the last few months has ledme to modify my views of unsuitability of Abdulla and our experience of last  fewweeks in Baghdad makes it fairly clear that no local candidate will be  successful  inobtaining sufficient local support to enable him to  make good.  Feisal alone of allArabian  potentates has  any idea of practical  difficulties of  running a civilisedgovernment on Arab lines.  He can scarcely fail to  realise that foreign  assistance  is vital to the continued existence of an  Arab State.   He realises  danger of  relying onan Arab  army.  If we were to offer him the Amirate of Mesopotamia not only mightwe re-establish our position in the eyes of  Arab world,  but we  also might go far  towipe out accusation which would otherwise  be made against us of bad faith both withFeisal and with people of  this country, and if His  Majesty&apos;s Government eventuallydecides drastically to restrict its commitments in this country there would be betterprospects of it being done with Feisal here than by any other possible  arrangement.General, Baghdad, cordially concurs.io  2625    100  8.20
