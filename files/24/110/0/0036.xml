Memoraad]am by the Secretary of State for War.     My colleagues will like to see this American tribute to the Military Administration of Palestine.                            (Initialled)   W.S.C.WAR 0WIC3.   5th August, 1920.O/o Banque federals, .         Berne,           Switzerland.  July 28th, 1920.Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill.My dear Mr. Churchill,           As an American, returning home after nearly ayear in Jerusalem, engaged in relief and educational work underthe British Military Administration, I wish to send you a fewwords about my experience there.  I was one of a delegation from the Anglo-American society of Amerioa who went to Jerusalemto help.our British brethren with their difficult task ofcoping with the distress left.by the TurkSj.   It was largelythrough the kind    help of Viscount Bryce that the Foreign  .Office gave the necessary permits for our work.           As the result of my unbiased observation I feel thatthe British people as a whole and the. 7/ar Office in particularcan be proud of the Military Administration in Palestine.  I amwilling to have my words quoted in Parliament, if you feel thatthey can be used helpfully.  .
           In our relief work we turned over all funds and clothing received from America to the British Relief officer in Jerusalem and so came into olose touch with the military administration.   V7e were treated with the utmost kindnessand consideration.  I found the members of the military administration hard-working, courteous and eager to be justto all races.   The tasK often seemed a thankless one and the hardships endured severe, but the good c freer of all was apparently never failing.  From my conversations with-membersof the local population and correspondence with friends athome I know that the general public has no idea of the burden-some limitations whioh were imposed upon tho Military .Administration by the circumstances left by the Turks.  It wasobliged to administer Turkish law and custom;  it could not make laws of its own;  it found the country mortgaged up tothe limit by financial engagements, largely to pay the interest on the Ottoman Publio Debt;  it had to wait for the applicationof the Mandate to make most of the much needed public improve-ments and was only empowered to execute such works as couldbe ascribed to military, necessity.  Even the introduction-ofwater into Jerusalem had to based upon military necessity,becausej as I was informed, some foreign country had a con-cession from the Turks to do this. Under the circumstances itwas wonderful that any improvements were made possible at all.During my stay Q2 nearly a year in Jerusalem I saw a welcomechange take place under the Military Administration.  The streetsgrew Cleaner, the dust was kept down, the roads repaired, treeswere planted, a beginning was made of beautifying the open  *spaces and the walls of the city, the destitute were taken care of, so that begging in the streets was very rare, and ingeneral the terrible after effects of the war,were handledwith wisdom and consideration fo.-: all races.   It was remarkablethat, with a large part of the revenue of the country already
mortgaged to the Ottoman Public Debt, the ^adgei?-o^&quot;l*al^1^Lne**could be balanced by the Military Administration and a sub-stantial surplus sot aside for future improvements..  I was informed that under the protection of the British occupationthe population of Palestine has increased very much and thatthe number of domestic animals has also risen greatly.  It wasthe privilege of the delegation from the Anglo-AmericanSociety of America to assist in making some of  these improve-ments and I am familiar with the facts in the case.:  Our workceased with the arrival of the Civil Administration, as itwas purely war relief work, and the different members of our delegation are now on their way home to America.  I myselfam spending a little while in Switzerland and am in lucernefor the time being.           In closing I wish to speak a word on behalf &quot;of themilitary officers with whom I was in closest personal contact,General Bols as ^chief Administrator of Palestine, Colonel- J.B.Barren, Financial Adviser;  Coi. Storrs, Military Governor of jerusalem, Col. E.L. Popham, Assistant Administrator, and captain  James Pollock, Relief Officer.  I found them strong,powerful men, devoted to  duty, fair and just.   They have  noidea that  I am writing to you and mentioning their names, butas an American I  feel  that I can take the liberty of doing so for  the sake of correct history and to bear  true witness  toan administration-which  has&apos; now gone down into  history.                         Sincerely yours,                      (Signed)  W.B-McCRACKAN*
