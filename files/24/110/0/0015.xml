[This^Document is the Property of Eis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government:!    ^ 61                  Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1920.        \^      Jf    fJ     hNOTE ON THE MESOPOTAMIA-PERSIA SITUATION BY SIR PERCY COX.    THE following note was written by Sir Percy Cox on his arrival in England,for the information of the Cabinet on the approaching discussion on the situationin Mesopotamia and Persia.                                                                  C.  OF K.    Foreign Office, July 30, 1920.         APPRECIATION OF MESOPOTAMIA-PERSIA SITUATION BY SIR P. Cox.                                Military as feet.     On arrival home I find that subsequent to my passage through Mesopotamia (20th-21st June) a sudden  rising against our authority  took  place  on the lower Euphrates at Ruimaitha; and that some temporary  apprehension existed lest the unrest should spread and become general. -     In order to deal with the Rumaitha rising the G.O.C. Mesopotamia had to put B in his last reserves  and on the 15th July  telegraphed suggesting that he should withdraw his detachments from the upper Euphrates and Kirkuk; and further that, in the event of further deterioration of the situation, he should withdraw  from Mosul to Baghdad.  With the- troops thus withdrawn he expected to hold! securely his lines of communication to Busrah and Teheran.  He also asked for  some  reinforcements from India, which, he said,  might have to amount to a division if the situation got worse.  He proposed to use these to re-establish control on the lower Euphrates.  On this correspondence discussion took place as to whether.it might  not be less objection- able to  withdraw from  the Baghdad-Kazvin line rather than from the Baghdad- Mosul.   The  military view is that the withdrawal  from Kazvin would be the least dangerous.     On  the 21st July news was received that Rumaitha had been  relieved, and General Haldane then  telegraphed that in view of the improvement of  the general situation it would suffice if one brigade were despatched from India instead of  a whole division.  The Government of India were not asked  to suspend their prepara- tions for the despatch of a division.     The above is the military aspect of the general  situation on which my views are asked.  My personal opinion is,  and  the latest reports seem to  support it, that the rising at Rumaitha was a local affair, engineered from outside by agitators at Nejaf who want no  mandate, and that it was not due to any specific hostility to  the British or to the Baghdad administration. I may mention that the medical  officer recently stationed at Diwaniyeh, who knows the locality of Rumaitha well, has  just arrived in England and he states that not only were  the community there quite  contented as  a whole with their lot  but  they actively expressed gratitude for  the blessing of Pax Britannica and  other material advantages which they had  received at  our  hands. His opinion is that the rising was the result of intrigue from outside working on the feelings of an excitable community which was uncertain of  British intentions and British strength. I feel confident that as soon as we can make  our intentions more fully known in the direction of  the establishment of an Arab administration, theseIntrigues and agitations will gradually cease.  It should be possible within the next fortnight or so to amplify the announcements which  we have already made in  regardto the constitution of the Arab State of Iraq.    As regards General Haldane&apos;s proposal for withdrawal I agree that withdrawal from Mosul would be calamitous and would afford no solution of  our difficulties.  Onits merits, withdrawal from Kazvin would be much less objectionable.  On the otherhand the present moment is an extremely unfavourable one for carrying, out suchwithdrawal, for reasons which I will explain.  Meanwhile I submit that the situationdoes not call, for withdrawal from either line.      [3998]1m
     As regards the force in North West,Persia, I personally have never contemplated that it should be maintained there indefinitely or indeed; for much longer.  When I left Teheran my view was that every effort should be made to retain Vossugh-ed- Dowleh and his cabinet, in power  long enough  to assemble the Majlis and get the Persian agreement passed through it.  Once this was done and the problem of thie&apos; Cossack division disposed of, our military commission would be able to begin putting their  scheme into execution and then iSlorperforce  could be gradually withdrawn. Since I left, the pendulum has swung violently.  I  need  not discuss the situation in detail; suffice it to say that my view is that we have now no alternative but to allow the Majlis to be assembled by the new Cabinet and endeavour to induce it to pass the agreement, possibly with unimportant modifications.  If it does so, well and good,&apos; then we can gradually withdraw Norperforce.  If it does not, and will not accept it in any form which we can tolerate, then,. I think, we must withdraw all our assist- ance to Persia, including the force on  the Baghdad-Kazvin line, and leave her to stew in her own juice for a period.  If we maintain effective control in Mesopotamia we can do this without any great risk. In either case I am of opinion that Norperforce must remain until the Anglo-Persian Agreement has been submitted to the Majlis. Until  that  takes place, the situation at Teheran will remain very difficult, and to withdraw Norperforce now would greatly  complicate the situation and increase the difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s Minister.     I  can only contemplate with the  greatest dismay the suggestion that we should withdraw from Mosul.  Such  a  course would greatly  prejudice  our position  in Baghdad and our prestige throughout Mesopotamia.  I  regard the maintenance of our present position in  Mesopotamia as a factor  of enormous importance  to  our general interests in the Middle East and India.   From an economic point of view I think it is common knowledge that the possibilities of Mesopotamia in oil, cotton, and wheat make it a country of great promise.  I understand that it is estimated that it will produce in the near future 2,000,000 cwt. of cotton and 1,000,000 tons of wheat. Oil is, of course, an uncertain quantity, but the prospect is at  any rate sufficient to attract to Mesopotamia the interest and capital of very large concerns.     Erom the strategical point of view, the maintenance of British control  in Mesopo- tamia  seems to me to be an asset of the greatest importance.  Mesopotamia lies on the route to India and the East for aviation and telegraphs,  and  is the shortest through route for railway communications.  We have previously considered the control of the port of Basra at the head of the Persian Gulf to be most important for the strength of our position in those waters&apos;.  It is especially so now-a-days in view of our large vested interests at Abadan, and in the oil of Arabistan; but its value would be entirely vitiated were Baghdad in the hands of a hostile Power.  Similarly from the political point of view, our effective control in Baghdad strengthens enormously our position and facilitates the carrying out our policy  in Persia.     Turning to the financial aspect  of  our  stay in Mesopotamia, apart from  the Army  of Occupation, the administration may be regarded as self-supporting and should soon become in a position to bear a proportion of  the cost of the Army.  Foi present purposes, therefore, we may ignore the cost of the civil administration.  As regards the cost of the Army of Occupation, the maintenance of the two  attenuated divisions and additional troops at present in the country, calculated at the present exchange rate of 2s. per rupee, amounts, I understand, to  24,000,000 sterling  per annum.   If the reinforcements now under orders-from India are sent there will be an additional  4,250,000, or a total of  28,250,000, exclusive of  capital expenditure on land and buildings.  But it is by no means contemplated that this expenditure should he in any way permanent or indefinitely, prolonged.   It is, I  fear hardly  possible to contemplate any reductions this year.   The security forces immediately necessary for the contemplated Arab State do not at present exist, ai\d  obviously cannot be created in a period of weeks or months; but I should expect that in one year from the date of establishment of the Arab administration  reduction might begin and  then proceed gradually.  I cannot estimate with confidence that the period would be less than two years, but I should hope that in three years reduction would be complete and that the State would be in a position to contribute the whole or a greater part of  the cost of that portion which it is desirable to retain.     I  now  beg  to touch lightly upon the complaints of late preferred against  the present civil administration and to suggest in general terms the^hanges  which it seems necessary to make in order to square our policy and practice with our under- takings and announcements.P
     Perusing the records of the past; two years I cannot but feel the greatest admiral- tion, from the point of view of industry and efficiency, for the work done by Sir A! T. Wilson and his co-adjutors, and it seems to me that a great deal of the hostile public criticism which has been hurled at the administration  is partly based on an inade- quate understanding of the circumstances in which it has come into being.  It  must be  remembered  that they  were entirely  different  from those which attended, our occupation  of Syria.    In Mesopotamia we started early in the war without any material in the way of personnel whatever, and in these conditions had to administer the country for the period of four years, during which warlike  operations were in progress.   WQ had no alternative but to have recourse for  the  personnel of the administration to the sources whence we could obtain it most easily,  which were from the Army of Occupation and from India.   Up to the moment  of the armistice I do not see  what other form of regime was possible.   After the armistice it  was no doubt advisable in theory  to start re-casting the administration, but the  future at that time as regards our position in Mesopotamia  was altogether uncertain, and it&apos; would have been exceedingly  difficult,  if not an impossible task, to  find a basis of reconstruction.   The other natural course was to await the signature of peace and a definite decision as to the future administration of  the country.    It is beyond dispute, however,  that  the existing administration is  much  too  English and&apos;too efficient to be compatible with our undertakings and needs  to be re-cast with1 as little delay as practicable.  It must be reconstructed to an extent which will reasonably satisfy Arab aspiration, while safeguarding our responsibilities as mandatory.  I believe this can be  done.   It is, I think, common ground that the Government  must have a  truly Arab  Facab and be predominantly Arab.   It goes without saying  that the realisation of this ideal will involve a  less efficient administration, and to tM&amp; we must make up our minds.  In view of the fact that we are responsible to other powers  with  regard  to  foreign relations and the treatment of foreign subjects by the Local Courts,  we must make such reservations as will safeguard our position in  those respects and at the same time ensure  adequate  control of  finances of the State, but the precise organisation of the civil Departments of State and the  amount of  special control  or advisory authority which  we must exercise, in  each case  is a matter for discussion, and I can hardly deal with it here.   The most lively problem confronting us  at  present is  the question  of the Head of the State.    It  will be remembered that Sir E. Bonham Carter&apos;s  Committee held the view, with which I agree, that it would smooth our path from the point of administration if the creation of  an Emir could  be postponed for some years, and if the British representative could fill his place in the meanwhile.    On the other hand,  I  gather the opinion prevailing  here  is that,  without the  creation of  a  definite head,  the- idea of sovereignty in the Arab  State would be  difficult  to  interpret.    The  immediate selection of an Emir connoting the establishment of dynasty is,  in my judgment, a problem of the greatest difficulty at the present epoch.   Sir  E. Bonham Carter&apos;s. Committee  has expressed the view that  Mesopotamia itself  contains no  eligible candidate.   In the case of any aspirant from outside, and two  or three have been mentioned,  such as Abdulla, son of the Sheriff, and  Ibn  Saud.  The objections which could be forwarded in either  instance seem to me at present insuperable.    At the same time  I  keep  an open mind, in case the question has to be seriously discussed, but my own opinion is that if a Head of the State is sine  qua non,  the State should be established as a  republic with an elected president.   If  the Allies and the League of Nations could be got to  agree it might be possible for the mandatory to select the first president.  In any case,  we could offer authoritative advice as to who was the most convenient candidate.  The period of presidency might be five  or seven years. This solution of the  problem  would have the advantage of not closing the  door to the ambition  of any aspirant, the son of the Sheriff or  Ibn Saud, or  whoever he be. I would prefer not to suggest candidates at present.  If the principle of a republic and a presidency be favourably regarded, the subject of candidates might be discussed in due course.     I would like to supplement  the above appreciation  in regard  to one  or  two points before concluding.               1     (i.) It has been written without regard to the contingencies of a serious invasion of Persia or a Turco-Bolshevik threat towards Mosul.     The materialisation of either of these contingencies would  obviously upset all calculation, and necessitate a reconsideration of the position.     (ii.) Since starting to  write the foregoing, I have seen Sir A. Wilson&apos;s telegram
of the 19th July,  in which he urges that, supposing that the instructions  of  theWar Office for despatch  of a  division have no reference to the Bolshevik menace,and unless some fresh urgency arises, the despatch of reinforcements in excess of a brigade should  be suspended, and  limited to the making up to strength  of  theexisting divisions.    This request seems to me sound, and it will no doubt receive due consideration.    (Hi.)  I take the opportunity to emphasise the urgent importance of pressing on railway construction both in respect  of the Kifri-Erbil extension and  the widening of the Bagdad-Hit line to 4-8J&quot; gauge.                                                                P. z. COX.    July 24,1920.
