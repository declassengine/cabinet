The War  Office,           29th July, 1920.                                       I.                          Urban  District of  Fermoi?.                                              Council Chamber, Fermoy,                                                               8th July, 1920. Sir,     The Fermoy Urban Council have directed  me to inform you that claims to the amount of about 20,000/. have  been  lodged  with the Council in connection with the destruction  of property in  the town and district  by the military on the 27th and 28th June ultimo.     The Council wish, to point out that, as is now well  known, in some instances  the destruction was of so violent a character that business has been actually wiped out, and it is more than probable that the  affected parties will  never again be on  the same financial standing as they were previous to the night of the attack.     The Council, as representatives of the people, earnestly demand  that these claims shall be met by the  Government, and that immediate  action will be taken by you towards that end.   Otherwise nothing but ruin is threatening these shopkeepers and&apos; traders, who were dependent upon their business for a living  for themselves and their families.     If  it is necessary I shall be happy  to supply you with any particulars you  may require.  -                               I           I remain,                                               Yours obediently,The General Officer      Commanding the Forces in Ireland,                         Parkgate, Dublin.(Signed)     W. Theeham,             Clerk of the Council.II.Sir,General Headquarters, Ireland,         Parkgate, Dublin,                   26th July, 1920.    In reply to your communication of the 8th July,  1920, addressed to the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland, I am directed to point out that themilitary authorities have taken  the necessary steps to enquire into the action  of thetroops on the 27th and 28th June, 1920.(B20/341) 100  7/20  H&amp;S, Ltd. 8437wo
                                      III.   ADJOURNED MONTHLY -MEETING OF THE URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF FERMOY,                   Held on Tuesday, the 25th day of May, 1920.              In the Chair:  WILLIAM J.  PA YE, Esq., Vice-Chairman.    The following Resolution was          Proposed by Councillor MICHAEL  J. SWEENEY ;         Seconded by Councillor GEORGE POWER ;and resolved :        .  That this Council of the elected representatives of the  town of Fermoy hereby    acknowledge the authority of the Dail Eireann as the duly elected Government of    the Irish People, and undertake to give effect to all decrees duly promulgated by    the said Dail Eireann in so far as same affect this Council.         That copies of this Resolution  be forwarded to  the Republican Minister for    Foreign Affairs in  Ireland for transmission  to the Governments of Europe and the    President and Chairman of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United    States of America.    Sealed with the Corporate  Seal of the Council of  the Urban  District of Fernioythis twenty-fifth day of May, in the year of Our Lord One thousand nine hundred andtwenty;    As regards your request for a public sworn enquiry, and for the meeting of claims that have been lodged with the Council, it would appear  that on  the 25th May, 1920,the Urban District Council at Fermoy passed a resolution acknowledging the authorityof Dail Eireann, presumably in supersession of that of the British Government.  Suchbeing the case, it would seem neither seemly nor proper for an  official of the BritishGovernment to take  any steps in  the directions referred  to  in your letters of the7th and 8th July, 1920.                                     Yours faithfully,                                   (Signed)   W. RYCROFT, Major-General,                                                    i/c Administration, Ireland.  Clerk of the Council,         Urban District Council,                          Fermoy.
