[This Document is the Property  of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]     CONFIDENTIAL.(c.P.  1 7 77    O        ...............-........                       A MIDDLE-EASTERN DEPARTMENT.         IT is very desirable that, before the Cabinet separates,  a decision should be     arrived at upon the question of the future departmental control of the Middle East.     Sir Percy Cox has pleaded strongly to the  Cabinet against the continuance of. the     present divided control.  The India  Office has repeatedly appealed to the Foreign     Office to be relieved of a responsibility which must in any  case terminate shortly.     No good administration can be called into being when it is supervised by two or three     Departments at home.     ^         In my previous paper I attempted to define what, in my judgment, the broad     principles of the new system ought to be.   In order to bring matters to a head and to(*3^C  obtain an early decision, I now submit definite proposals.         There appears to be general agreement upon the following propositions:          1. That, whether it be intrinsically desirable or not, it is now impracticable, for               Parliamentary reasons, to  create a new Ministry  for the Middle East.         2. That,  for  physical reasons, it is  impossible to create  a new and detached               Department, because there is no space in which to house it.         3.  That it is  impossible to sever from the Foreign Office the countries or areas               which are at present under Foreign Office control.  These are Turkey-in-               Europe and Turkey-in-Asia, the Caucasus, Persia, and Syria (in relation               to the French).   The problems arising out of these  territories are in the               main diplomatic problems, and can  only be dealt with by  the  Foreign               Office.         4.  That the problems arising out of the remaining countries of the Middle East               are in  the main administrative problems, and require to be dealt with               by a staff specially collected for the purpose.   These countries are Egypt,               the Soudan, Palestine,  Arabia,  Aden, and  Mesopotamia.    They  are               the countries which should be assigned to the new organisation.  &apos;         5.  For their administration it- is probably  desirable that.a new Middle East               Service should be created.  At  present there  are in existence an Egyptian               Civil Service, a  Soudan Civil  Service, and a  Levant  Service, whila               Mesopotamia is being administered by  a mixed service, drawn from all               three and from the Indian Civil Service as well.         The number of British officials in  Egypt will, it is believed, under Lord Milner&apos;s     proposals, be greatly reduced.         The number in the mandated territories will be reduced as the native Govern -     ments become less  and  less dependent upon the assistance of the mandatory Power.     Arrangements as to pension or discharge with gratuities will  accordingly require     to be made.  Whether Egypt and the Soudan come into this arrangement can only     be  decided later.    The remaining  areas will in any case be sufficient to sustain a     Middle-East Service of their own.         If, for the reasons before stated, it is impossible to create a new  Ministry or     sub-Ministry, two alternatives remain :          (a.) To appoint a new  Parliamentary Under-Secretary.    This  can  be done               without fresh legislation under the New Ministries and Secretaries Act               of 1916; but it may be open to Parliamentary  criticism  as  involving               an additional placeman and fresh expense.  Further, it involves finding               accommodation for an additional staff of secretaries, typists, &amp;c.         (&amp;.)  To appoint an existing Parliamentary  Secretary as the head of the new               Department.         I think it is generally agreed, and Sir Percy Cox has argued strongly, that for     the time being this Department must be placed in the Foreign Office, for the reason     that no other Department has the qualification, the expert knowledge, or the available     staff.  The staff would have nothing to do with the Diplomatic Service, and would be          [4095]
drawn provisionally from the countries concerned, later from the new Middle-EastService.  The Department would be much, in the same position as  the Departmentof Overseas Trade, the head of which  is an Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office,although he has a separate organisation.  We can find space for this establishment in the Foreign Office (which I believe&apos; no other Department can) by a reduction of the over swollen number of the News Department.    I therefore propose :     (a.)  That the new Department be created as from the 1st October next.  On          that day it may be mentioned that.the Arab Bureau at Cairo, which has          hitherto managed Palestine, the  Hedjaz,  and Aden, comes to an  end.          Palestine has already been  taken  over by Sir H.  Samuel,  The Hedjaz          and  Aden  will  revert to London, and will fall naturally to the  new          Department.    (b.) That  if  a new  Under-Secretary be  not appointed to the Department          Mr. Harmswdfth, who has time at his disposal for the work, be invited to          assume charge.    (c.) That he be given  a non-Foreign  Office staff,  drawn from the countries          concerned.   I am in a position to recommend as the head of this staff an          officer who has an almost unique experience of- the Middle East.    If these proposals are accepted I believe that the hew organisation can be startedwithout difficulty or delay.  When it has been tested for  a few years, it can either be expanded into something larger, or be modified, in the light of experience.                                                                  C. OF K.    August 16,1920.
