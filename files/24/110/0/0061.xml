SITUATION IN GERMANY                  Report by Lord DfAhornon.                                          British Legation,                                               \Tarsaw.                                            30th July,  1920.      My Lord,            In  reply to      Lordship&apos;s telegram No.  2H of      the  25rd  Instant, I have  the honour to submit a Report  on      the  financial situation of Germany, with a view to the      discussions which are to  take  place at Geneva.                                       up            This  Report has been drawn/under circumstances      of some pressure  here;  and individual  figures may require      corrections,  which I shall be  able  to  supply after a  short      stay  in Berlin.            The general tendency, of  my views,however, will      not,  I think,  be  changed  by any alteration of individual      figures which I am likely to find, necessary on  a  further      examination of the position.                             I have,  etc r                     (S signed)    D1Ahernon.The Rt. Hon.   The Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G.
J                               Warsaw,                                   50th  July, 1920.NOTE  ON THE FINANCIAL SITUATION&apos;      The governing  fact  to be remembered  in economic andfinancial discussions- respecting Germany is that  she isuncommonly near bankruptcy.     Recovery is only  possiblethrough great skill  on  the part of her financial  authorit-&quot;ies,  aided by careful, nursing, of economic,  factors: on thepart  of all interested.   The only chance  of obtaining fromGermany any large  annuity towards reparation is intelligentassistance, enabling her  to revive her agriculture and herindustry.&apos;  Blind  demands for payment either in kind or in cash  without reference  to the practical  possibilities  ofthe moment, without  intelligent consideration of  thepsychology of the  tax payer, and without reference to theeffect of an excessive  immediate burden  on the economic recovery of the aountry,  are certain to  mean a breakdown.The first consideration for the pilot is to avoid the shoalof bankruptcy; it  matters much less if he  takes a course a little wide of the shortest.      It should be recognised from the beginning, as a bas-io fact, that, without  a  radical change  in Germany&apos;s pres-eht financial situation,  there is not the  slightest chanceof Germany being able to  pay full amount of reparation&apos; forwhich she is responsible  under the Treaty, which  may beestimated at from. 11 to 12 thousand millions&apos; sterling.An improvement so  radical as to enable her  to raise this amount may or may  not be  ultimately possible; but It iscertainly impossible without, the most careful administrateion and without time...      It follows that it  is useless to press a hard or
precise interpretation of any individual claim., since theresult will be not to increase the total sum obtainedfrom Germany, but merely to transfer payments from germany from one heading to another; thua an increased contributeion under heading; a. would merely diminish the amount available under heading b*      It may, therefore, be said, and this,is an importantfact, that nothing is to be gained by riding any Individ-ual claim too hard.  The real desiderata at Geneva appeartherefore to be:-(1) A minimum annuity at once;(2) A postponement of the discussion to,fix the totali    amount of the final indemnity until the situation has    developed.      I should even doubt whether an endeavour to fix asliding scale or barerne, under which the minimum annuitywould increase in proportion with either German production or German exports or German revenue, is now desirable.My chief reasons for this view are;-      The extreme confusion of German currency.  Until thisis stabilised, no. serious forecast can be made of thefinancial future of Germany.  It  is impossible to exagger-ate the importance of this factor.      A second reason why any serious forecast is imposs-ible now Is  the fact that during  the war no  increase oftaxation was  imposed in Germany.  A very stringent schemeof taxation  has been elaborated during  the last sixmonths and is now being applied.   w&quot;e must  see  how this increased taxation  is paid before forming  an opinion asto the possibility  of its maintenance or its increase.It is, therefore,  impossible for  anyone, even  with thefullest information, to estimate  now  tho payment germany could bear,in future years.  Any  excessive demands
or even undue    &apos;             precision  in demands willgain nothing and will injure&apos;, if .they do not kill,&apos;.theprospects of the future.  Apart from this,&apos; as a matter of tactics, it may ho observed that the Germans themselves have greater interest in fixing a definite sum than the  .Allies have in imposing it.  They must, in their own interest, come forward with a proposal.&apos;  Is not a proposal from their side a better basis for negotiation than ademand from ours?      There Is  another reason against a premature,attemptto fix the final figure of indemnity.  The views of theFrench and Gorman Governments are, for the moment, too farapart for any compromise to be possible or for any broker,however ingenious, to bring thorn together!  I can imagineno figure which, adopted today, would not so shock publicopinion in one country or the other, as to break downnegotiations.      The Boulogne scheme represented a groat advance, in .that it constituted a considerable reduction of the previous -ious French estimates.  On the other hand, it did good inGermany where its chief outlines were known, in that itshowed the German Ministers how far their ideas what short of thoso of the Entente.  But, as a matter of fact, theBoulogne figures represented a. level of demand which isquite unattainable at present, unless the reparation in kind represented by coal and other deliveries is calculatedat a very high figure. -  The minimum annual payment agreedto at Boulogne was three milliards of marks gold per annum.This represents, at the present exchange, ajpproximately24 milliards of marks paper.  The total estimated revenue of tho German State on the basis of the new taxation is approximately 31 milliards ordinary budget and her minimuminternal,expenditure necessary to her existence as a State
  at approximately the same amount.  As the German Budget  barely balances, without leaving anything for indemnity,  the payment of this annual sum in cash would Lie an nearly  doubling all German taxation.   How it is quite doubtful  whether the new scheme of taxation  calculated to produce  31 milliards can be smoothly worked.  It is altogether  impossible to conceive that twice the new rate of taxation  could be imposed without producing a revolution.        There is a further question, the advisability of a  loan based on a minimum annuity, which was discussed,&apos;at  Spa, in the belief that a loan was urgently required by  ,France and would be cordially welcomed by Germany.  The  French financial authorities, however, appeared less keen  than we anticipated about a loan, while the German unofficial financial/ authorities said that as far as they were  concerned they  were indifferent whether a loan was issued or not.   The  only real point of vital interest to them was the possibilities-  ity of balancing expenditure with revenue and thus  ceasing to depend upun the printing press.   &apos;7hether this  view was sincero or not, I cannot say.  It seems rather  to conflict with other statements which have been made  regarding the necessity of more food and more raw material.  But even if a loan is not urgent, I should still advocate  an endeavour to obtain at Geneva a promise of an annual  minimum payment, as a payment on aceount of - future indemnity-  nity and as a basis on which further financial arrangements  could be made.        In conclusion, the view which the Entente should , in  my opinion, keep constantly before them, is that Germanyrs  present financial position is very precarious; but that,  on a long view, the economic position show3 signs of the  possibility of future improvement.

German income tax rates are thus very high indeed.Indirect taxation also is apparently on a correspondingly highscale.

IOC. m.. or 40     In the above Tables, the &quot;pro-war&quot;&apos;value of Enrdish revenuesis based on English price-level  (1920 prices being twice thoseof 1913):  for France and Germany the&quot;pre-war&quot; value is basedon the present races of exchange for the franc and the markagainst the paper pound of 1920.   The franc and the mark mayhave a somewhat different value in purchasing goods in Prance andGermany from their value in exchange against the paper pound, sothat some variation in the figures given for the &quot;pre-war&quot; valueswould be quite admissable.   But it remains broadly true that,whereas both France and England have substantially increased the real(as well as the nominal) value of their tax revenues, the real value of the German revenues has substantially declined.
          Germany might be askei.. to explain why, in spite of tho     enormous increase in her rates of taxation, she is getting     less real value out of her taxes.          Partial explanations oi this are:-     1.   Gorman production has declined;   This is probably     temporary:  most oi the contributory factors mentioned on     page 4 of the memorandum on &quot;Germany1s solvency for purposes     of reparation&quot; are &quot;common to the whole world, and aro beginning     to disappear as the world recovers from the re-action after     the hard work of war.    Travelling through agricultural  ,     Germany, at any rate.,  one does not get an impression of a     hopelessly sullen or listless people.   In so far, however,     as decline of production is a cause of the discrepancy between     the high ,rates and the low yield of German production, the     moral is to avoid discouragement of German-production.     &amp;.   The disappearance of large German fortunes,  due to     (a) the capital levies,  and (b) the revolution,, and disappear-is a factor, but its importance can easily be exaggerated-.     ance of capitalists abroad.^ . The German budget&apos;was never so     dependent on a very few rich individuals as for example the     English.     3.   The newness to German life of intensive taxation.   A     citizen requires training before he can become a good tax-     payer on a high scale..     &apos;4.

(2) liiarks are possibly slightly more valuable if used               for buying goods in Germany than if used for buying               English sovereigns.     Per the first of these reasons, it is impossible to expectfrom Germany the same rate of tax per head as is attained inEngland.    But the discrepancy in the above figures is verylarge and might well be brought to Germany1s attention.
5. The Currency Position.          German currency &quot;(jiotes and coin)  before-the &quot;war was     probably from 4,000 to 5,000 -million.jnarks.     It is now     estimated at abdut 64,000 million marks:  but a large     proportion (variously estimated at from 20,000 to 34,000     million) is held abroad, leaving the probable internal circul-     ation at from 40,000 to 50,000 million marks, or approximately     ten times the pre-war emulation.   The present level of German &apos;     prices is likewise estimated by the German experts at about ten     times the pre-war price level.          Question   V/hat is Germany^ liability in the event of the     sudden presentation of the large number of marks held abroad?     And what cover has she against such liability?6. The German Debt.          This is estimated at 197,000 million marks, of which     105,000 million marks is floating.   How can she keep such a     floating debt afloat?          Her 1920 Budget appropriates only 12,000 million a year for&apos;     debt services: this represents only a fraction over six per cent     interest on her debt.   How has she contrived to borrow so     largely at such a low average rate?7. Military expenditure and foreign investments.      , .          Before the war, in addition to her large military and naval     expenditure, Germany invested about  100 million annually abroad.     V/hy are these amounts not now available for reparation?Ijain Conclusion.     1.   The mark is heavily depreciated,  and liable still to violent     fluctuation.   There is no possibility of estimating the amount     which Germany can finally pay, until a definite and stable value     can be assigned to the mark.     2.   Stabilisation.          Stabilisation of the currency of other large European
        countries  with whioh  Germuiy  trades  is  likewise necessary        &quot;before  any final  estimate  of  Germany^  true  financial        position can to made.    -This  rather  points to the advisabil-        ity  of.  conducting the  internal  conference regarding currency        and  finanoo at the same  time  as  the  Geneva Conference, end        in relation to it.    So  long  as  the  European currency position        remains  unstable&apos;  and  ^regularised,  nobody knows what is        meant in speaking of  francs,  marks,  lire and kronen. -        3.   There is a wide  discrepancy between tho high, rates and        low  yield.of German taxation.    This  is cue  mainly to (a)        decrease of production,  and (ID)  newness of the fiscal machine,        both to  those who pay  taxes and  those who collect.,  ifith        time and careful  handling, there should be substantial.        improvement both  In production and in the yield of taxation,;&apos;        A cardinal point  of taxation  is;  to avoid synchronisation of        increased  taxation with  increased indemnity  payments:; the        former  should always precede  thfc.latter - just as In England,        In drink taxation, the retail price  of  drink was allowed to        go up one  year, and. corresponding taxation only imposed:in        the  year following.-            The rate of  tax  levied this year is nominally much        higher  than last  year    ever before.   There will, therefore,        be initial difficulties  of collection, which will be got        oyer in  time.   On the other  hand, the  estimated revenue        represents in gold less  than  the pro-war tax-revenue, and        is,  therefore, probably  a smaller proportion of the total        national income than before the  war.    This  leads to the        hope that  it may  be possible  to  realise greatly improved        returns, as the initial difficulties  of  collection are over-        cpmo,-hit ehall Gar dens,  S..?, 10th August 1920              /
