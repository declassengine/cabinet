    MOIEB OH POSSIBLE BLOCKADE MEASURES ASAIM3I RUSSIA.        So far as the prevention of British goods being   exported to Russia in concerned there are full powers   at the present moment and iia actual fact no goods are   all owe-. I to be exported to Russia from this country   at the present time except under licence and in   practice no licences are granted.  TheSe powers   dfepend on the fact that the &quot;present war&quot; had not yet   been legally terminated.  On the other hand there   are no British regulations to prevent persons in the   United Kingdom making payments to Russia or having   Other financial transactions with that oountry   or insuring goods destined for Russia or supplying   gbods from Germany, Sweden, etc.  to Russia - transao-   transactions which were of course forbidden in the case of   Germany and which would probably be held to be   contrary to the Common law the moment war was declared   on Russia.        It will be convenient to consider separately the   courses of action that would be necessary according as   the present war is or is hot legally terminated and war   is or Is not declared against Russia.1. &quot;Present war&quot; hot at an end and war not declared on Russia   Under the existing regime all goods exported from the   United Kingdom and destined for Russia require an   export licence.  By continuing the refusal of export   licences, we should prevent the supply of goods direct   from this  oountry but it might be necessary to control   the export of goods to neighbouring countries in order   to prevent the indirect supply pf goods to Russia.   This would not involve any fresh legislation or other   action beyond the withdrawal (by administrative action   of the Board of Trade) of the General Licences under   which goods other than the comparatively small number   on Lists A and B of prohibited exports, may at   present be exported to those countries without special   licence.  If necessary, the whole of the machinery of   prohibition  and restriction in operation against Germany   during the period of hostilities could be restored   but it would probably be unnecessary to go so far in   the case of Russia.  *7e should, however, have no   power to interfere (except by means of rationing   agreements) with the supply of goods to Russia by other   countries.  It hardly seems possible to keep up the   partial naval blockade which&apos;with the consent of other  &apos; Powers has been in operation with regard to articles of   military use on the ground that they might find their   way to our enemies now that treaties of peace have been   or are on the point of being signed with those Enemies.   This, however, is a question for the foreign Office and   Admiralty rather than the Board of Trade.
         The existing legislation,  whether permanent or passed    for the duration of the present war; would not enable us to    prevent the direct or indirect importation of goods of    Russian origin exported with a view to increasing Russians    resources, or indeed to prevent any financial or    commercial transactions (other than the actual export of    goods from the United Kingdom)  and persons in this country    would he at liberty for example to supply funds for the    assistance of Russia and supply, carry and insure goods    from other countries to Russia^2*  &quot;Present War11 not at an end and war declared on Russia. In    this case the-powers of controlling exports from the united    Kingdom referred to under (l) would of course remain.  In    addition there would of course be the right to deal by means    of a naval blocka.de with the supply of contraband from    ncn-British sources.         In time of war all trade between British subjects and    the enemy is illegal under the English Common Law.  Having    regard to complicated nature of modem international commerce    which might make the application of the Common Law to certain    classes of transactions somewhat difficult and also to the    existence of doubts as to the precise degree of criminality    to be attached to trading with the enemy it would probably    he considered expedient to follow the precedent of the pres-ent    war and immediately after the declaration of war on Russia    to issue a Trading with the Enemy Proclamation forbidding    persons in the British Empire to have commercial and financial.    transactions with Russia.  This would be followed by an Act    of Parliament giving the Royal Proclamation statutory force    in the United Kingdom and setting out the) penalties for    offences under it,  If no special measures were taken beyond    the declaration of war reliance would have to be placed on    the Common Law to deal v/ith any attempts to assist the enemy    (other than by the supply of goods from this country as to    which as already stated/ full powers exist so long as the    &quot;present war&quot; continues).3*  &quot;Present Y/ar&quot; at an end and war not declared against Russia***    In this case the emergency legislation would have ceased to    be in operation, there would he no excuse for any sort of    control of imports into Russia from other countries and    Russia not being an enemy there would be no possibility of    involving the Common. Law against persons in this country who    assisted Russia.         There would,- however,  under permanent legislation still    be certain powers of export control.  These are as follows:    Under Section 8 of the Customs  and Inland Revenue Act?1879,    there is power by Proclamation  or Order in Council to    prohibit the export of &quot;arms, ammunition and Gunpowder,    &quot;military and naval stores, and any article which Her    &quot;Majesty shall judge capable of being converted into or made    &quot;useful in increasing the quantity of military or naval    &quot;stores, provisions or any sort of victual whioh may be    &quot;used as food for.man&quot;.      A prohibition under this
10. 8. 20*   .Aat--m7ul&amp;* ilr will be noted, be general: it would not   be restricted to any epfcoXtied &apos;*ountry or countries.  Power   to prohibit the export of xaost of the above.-named articles   to specified destinations is given by the Exportation of   Arms Act 1900 (in certain oircums-tances which would doubt-   less be held to apply in the case of Russia) Section 1   providing as follows: &quot;It shall be lawful for Her Majesty   &quot;by proclamation to prohibit the exportation of all or any   &quot;of the following.articles, namely: arms, ammunition,   &quot;military and naval stores, and any article whioh Her   &quot;Majesty shall judge capable of being converted into or   &quot;made useful in increasing the quantity of arms, ammunition   &quot;or military or naval stores; to any country or place there-   &quot;in named, whenever Her Majesty shall judge such prohibition   &quot;to be expedient in order to prevent such arms, ammunition   &quot;military or naval stores, being used against Her Majesty^   &quot;subjects or forces; or against any forces engaged or which  &quot;may be engaged in military or naval operations in co-   &quot;operation with Her Majesty^ forces&quot;.        It &quot;will be observed that these powers of export oontrol   are restricted to certain olasses of goods, that the   classes of goods are not Very precisely defined and  that   questions .of interpretation might arise similar to   those which arose in connexion with the control of Imports   on whioh the Sankey decision was given*  It is clear,   however, that without special legislation and without de-   daring war on Russia it would be possible to prohibit   the export of arms, ammunition and military and naval stores^4. &quot;Preset 7/ar&quot; at an end and ?ar declared on Russia.   In this case the emergenoy legislation would have gone   but without any further legislation we should fin addition   of course to the right to prevent the passage of contraband   from other countries) have the Common law to rely upon to   prevent all forms of trading with the enemy and apart from   the powers to prohibit  generally or to name.d destinations   the export from the United Kingdom of arms, ammunition &amp;c.   referred to in (3)  above we should have the much larger   powers of export control conferred by Sections (1) and (2)   of the&quot;Customs (Exportation prohibition) Act 1914 and Section   1 of the Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act 1914 which   extend the provisions of the Acts of 1879 and 1900 referred   to in (3) of this Rote tO:all articles whilst a state of war   in which His Majesty   is engaged $xists and not merely   during the &quot;present war&quot;.  Consequently immediately on   the declaration of war on Russia there would be power under   existing legislation to prohibit either generally or to   named destinations the export of any class of goods from tielirited   Kingdom,  Practically the full control of exports  in oper-   ation during the period of hostilities against Germany   could be restored without fresh legislation but there were   certain acts passed to facilitate administration which were   limited to the &quot;present war&quot; and which would have to be   re-enacted if it-were considered necessary to have the same   powers in the case of a war against russia (For  example,   under Section 3 of the Customs */ar powers Act 1916 the   Board of Trade may authorise the Customs to prevent export-   ation of any class of goods prior to the issue of a Pro-   olamation or Order in Council.)        If it were desired to define precisely what forms of   trading with the enemy were prohibited, instead of relying   on the Common Law,  legislation would be required as noted   in Section 2 of this Note,
