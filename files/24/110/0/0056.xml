The Cabinot have reserved until September 1st the      announcement in regard to the increases in W6rkmen*s fares.      &quot;In the meantime! I desiro to dra?/ the attention of the Cabinet      to the effect of the present proposals upon the Housing Schemes      in and around London.   The attached tables indicate the nature      of the ^Increase and the number of new houses affected.   It will,      I think, be agreed that in many cases the percentage increase is      far too high and likely to stultify the efforts of the Government      to get the population into better housing conditions further      removed from the centre of the Metropolis.   The case of the large      provincial centres is not so pressing as they are more largely      met by tram services.2*              I therefore ask that the Cabinet should require a      substantial reduction of the scale of early cheap train fares      proposed by the Rates Advisory Committee.Ministry of Health.
