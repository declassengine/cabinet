-  (THIQQSU-TO I3 TB PROPERTY 0* HIS BiUTAiMIC UAjAlLS government^NMRNT)SBCl^TCP.  1764CABINET      POLANDNOT&apos;5 BY THE SSOjRifiTARY           I circulate herewith some Minutes of a Conference between the Franco-British Mission and Members of the Polish Council of National  Defence held  at Warsaw on August  2,  1920, which  have been forwarded  to me by General Sir P.  de  B. Radcliffe,  on  behalf of  Lord d&apos;Abernon.   They had been agreed to  by  the  French but had not been presented  to the Poles. Unfortunately,  these Minutes confirm my apprehensions that General Weygand  would not  be able  to make  his advice  effective owing  to the weakness of the Polish Staff  and  Administration.           I should like  to take this opportunity  to supplement my  Report,  No.  CP.  1724 with a note in regard to  the ftarsaw- Dansig railway  via Mlaws,  as I made special  inquiry into this subject from the British Railway  Officer  in  Warsaw.   According to  him, this railway was of no  great importance.   It  was used purely for commercial purposes and  not at  all  for  the trans- port of war material,  since it  traversed  the  German territory in  Bast Prussia.  It  was also not used much  for passengers. The total traffic over the  railway  amounted  to five trains a day  each way.  He  did not  apprehend any  serious  inoonve- nience from its loss,  even though it.was the  shortest line. The main line from Warwaw  to Danzig?, along which I travelled on my  journey home,  is through Thorn and Broiaberg, and is seme 70 miles west of Mlawa, the greater part  of the  linebeing west of the Vistula.    In any  case there  is an alternative line as far as Bromberg well covered by the Vistula.  Conse- quently, the occupation of  points on the Warsaw-Mlawa line doesnot constitute any immediate threat  to the principal  railway communications of Warsaw, and of Poland west of Vtarsaw,with       Danzig./Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.

           MINUTES OF 00HffS3&amp;N0E  ,     between the ffranoe-British Mission     ana  Members of the  Polish Council     of National Defence held at Warsaw        3rd August; 1920 at  9.30 v*m.&quot;ABMISTICB IflSGOTlATIOMS.      The Minister for Foreign Affairs brought  to notice the equivocal proceedings of the Russian Soviet Government  in demanding that the polish Delegates should proceed  to  Minsk  on  4th August, there to discuss not  only the Armistice  terns  but conditions of peace as well,  thus bearing out exactly the indications of deliberate bad  faith revealed  in their intercepted telegram.   Prince  Sapieha stated  that whilst anxious to do  nothing that would lay  themselves open to the charge of  lightly  rejecting a  chance of peace the Polish Government  felt that before  sending a fresh Delegation to Minsk  they ought, to be informed as to the  views  of the Entente powers  on  the new situation thus created.   In  view of the  fact  that the negotia- tions  had  been  initiated by the  Entente who had thus been deliberately  flouted,  the  Polish Government felt that the only fitting reply was  a declaration of war by France  and England on the  Soviet Government of Russia.   Such a  declaration,  even if not followed up by active  measures,  would have an incalculable moral effect in  augmenting the resisting  power of Poland and  the  limitrophe States.  The  latter, it was urged, should all be enlisted  in the  cause of what was in reality  world civilisation  and  support should be given to General Wrangel who  vvithin  two days could effect a junction with the  Roumanians.                                     M. Jusseraod                      -1-
          M.  Jusserand jpointed out that mere throats and     partial  support of the anti-Bolshevik forces had     hitherto not boon successful and nothing short of armed     intervention on an adequate scale was now likely to     bring the Soviet Government to terms.          After further discussion the members of the Franeo-     British Mission agreed to telegraph to their respective     Governments in order to obtain their views with regard     to the new situation which had arisen in the Armistice     negotiations.2*    POSITION OF 0E33RAL JVBYSAMD          M.  Jusserand  said that  the members  of the Franco-     British  Mission had been requested  by the  Polish     Government  to return to Paris  and London in order  to     report personally  on the Polish  situation  and  before     leaving  it  was  essential to  know whether the Polish     Government  wished  General Weygand to  remain on and to     continue acting as special adviser  regarding the conduct     of military operations.   If  this  was  ths case  both General     v/eygand  and  General Radcliffe  were  prepared to stay for the     time  being  if they could  be  of service,  but only on     condition that  their  assistance  should be  taken seriously     and turned  to practical  account.          For instance,  in tho first  place, it  must be  clearly     understood  that all  important  information,  good or bad,     should be unreservedly communicated to him.   Secondly,     once  General  Weygand1s advice  on  any  matter had been     accepted it must be at once  translated into action by     orders promptly given and effectively carried  out.  The     Franco-British  Mission were, therefore,  anxious to know     before their  departure whether the  Polish  Government were     in accord with  there  viewer                                             gh^e Chief  of  ..y
     The Chief,of the Staff paia a warm tribute tothe assistance he had received from General Weygand.with whom he had been co-operating during the last few days.  He invariably placed all information at(general Weygand &apos;s disposal and found himself inagreement with him oil all points save one, viz. -the operations in the South against Budonic, whiohit was impossible to discontinue owing to tho specialei?ourostances of the case.     General Hoswodowsky proceeded to enlarge upon the difficult situation in which the Polish army founditself, being as it was an entirely new and improvisedorganisation deficient in training and experience andlacking officers with the necessary professional qualifications.  He further alluded to the exhaustion of the troops after their long and continuous marching,and their inferiority in technical equipment.   In thisconnection he ire.v particular attention to the delay in the arrival of the arms  and ammunition from Danzigin spite of the efforts which General Haking had made.There was documentary evidence of collusion between thelabour elements in Danzig and the Hussian Soviets andhe considered that drastic measures should be taken todeal with the situation.     General Rosr/odowsky in conclusion, stated that thePolish Staff accepted entire responsibility with regardto the operations but that they would be glad ofGeneral Weygand1s advice nevertheless.                                     Lord d!Abernon.*.                         -3-
      Lord a1 Abortion said he wished to receive  a positive assurance from the Chief of the Staff, firstly, that General rieygand would be given all relevant information promptly and, secondly,  that his guidance  would bo really followed.      General  Weygand  said  that  he had  teen forced to conclude that  he was not  exercising  any  real influence  as  he found  that his advice produced no results  within a  reasonable  time.   He had,  therefore, felt  it  his duty  to report accordingly  to the Heads of the Mission and to  ask  them  to lay the  matter before the polish Government.      The Chief of the Staff  pointed  out  that the - conditions obtaining in the  Polish Army were quite different from those to which General weygand was accustomed.  The latter had  been used to dealing with  an Army and a  country organised and prepared for a great number of years.  In Poland  everything had had to be improvised within the last year.  Both officers and men lacked the  training necessary to ensure the carrying out of orders.      General Roowodowsky went on to  say that under these conditions defensive tactics invariably failedwhile tho offensive succeeded; therefore, the Polish army must attack,  but this required reserves and those they were endeavouring to organise.     The Minister of Finance  (M.  Grabskl)  declared that the defence of Warsaw was a political necessity; - therefore, the troops must be capable of the defensive.                                      The Minister. *.                       -4-;
     TheiiMnistor.,forboreign Affairs regretted thatGeneral  Weygand should have had oause to think thathis advioo was not followed, and assorted that hisguidance was of such value that the Polish Governmentset the  greatest  store by it and could not do without it.  As  far as he  could speak in the absence of theChef dliStat they  would be prepared, if necessary, toput the matter on a new basis but in any case he beggedthe General not to be discouraged and to carry on hiswork.     In reply to a question by Lord d&apos;Abernon as towhether Prince SapiehaTs statement might be taken asan official expression of the Government1s views theVioe President of the Council (M.  Daseynscski)  andthe Minister of Finance (M.Grabski) both replied..inthe affirmative.     General Weygand said he was much honoured  by theconfidence which the Polish Government displayed inhim.  His relations with the Chief of the Staff woreexcellent but he felt that he produced no results.     Lord d&apos;Abernon said that Prince Sapiohalsdeclaration was quite satisfactory and very different from that of the Chief of the Staff, whioh did  not satisfy hii?.- at all.     j:^-Chief of  tho Staff  said that it was impossibleto unify several different schools of thought.   Heand the Chef d&apos;Btat were one as to the necessity ofthe offensive.                                    General Weygand...                     .  -5-
      General ^eygand said  that it  was  the  teaching of all  war experience that victory could only be won by tho  offensive  but before an offensive could be launched  it  was neoessary  to assemble  the  troops and give  them a  breathing space in Which to organise and prepare for  tho attack.  It was useless to issue orders for an  offensive  to  troops  who  wore quite  incapable of carrying  them  out  and whose  exact whereabouts was even  unknown.  It was a question of the method of execution not of principle  on which  he differed.      Ihh ..Ghief of the Staff stated that he was quite ready to  resign his appointment in favour of General Weygand but  the latter would find that the  Polish army  was  a vary different thing from what he was accustomed to deal with and he wo;uld find the problem very  difficult.      General Weygand stated that he had already been approached in the sense indicated but for many reasonshe could  in no circumstance accept tho position of chief of  the Staff.   He had said what he had only inorder to make it clear, that any influence he could exercise must of necessity be small.     The Minister o^finance said  that this should bemade known to the Chef dTiiitat.     The Yice-Minister for War reported that severemeasures had been taken to deal with delinquents; no less than 12 death penalties having been awarded inthe last two days.  He suggested that General oeygandshould establish an office at        which  wouldprovide machinery in the shape of Polish officers tokeep him  completely informed as to all details.

SSSMJSJiJMlPOLICY.OF  POLISH  GOyjtjgMgNT.      In  reply  to a  question  of tord  d&apos;Abemon as tothe future  intention  of the  Government the ministerfor Foreign Affairs stated that it had been decided todefend.Warsaw  to the  last moment  consistent with themaintenance of tho Army intact, the  latter considerationbeing vital.     Should it be necessary  to evacuate Warsaw it wouldbe  done at the last minute in order  to avoid creating a panic  In any case only the machinery of theGovernment and the supplies and stores essential forthe Army would be evacuated as it was out of tdaequestion to attempt anything more.     The vast quantities of munitions and food  supplies in Warsaw rendered  it essential to hold the city aslong as possible.     As regards the new seat of Government PrinceSapieha said that no decision had  yet been taken butthat the chedee lay between:-(1)  Posen.(I)  Chestochova.(3)  Cracow.     As regards Posen tfris would be most suitable froma strategical point of view as affording easiestcommunication with Danzig,  tin only access which poland would have to the outside world.   On the othor  hand thepopulation of Posen was to a considerable extent Gormanand this was objectionable.  Chestochova was bound up with the most cherished traditions of Polish history and the Catholic religion.  It was in the heart of a purelyPolish territory and with the halo of national sentimentsurrounding it would  form a good rallying point for thePolish people.  Though not so well placed as Posen for
communication with Danzig it was yet not so badly offin that respect.     Cracow was the ancient capital and a fortress, but might easily be completely severed from all oommuni-demobilisation with the allies.     In conclusion the Vice President of the Councilrequested the Franco-British Mission to point out totheir respective Governments that the Russians were now invading the heart of Poland in flagrant contemptof all notes presented by the Entente..
