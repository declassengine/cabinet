SOVIET RUSSIA.         The possibility of the  Red Fleet  coning  out, moreespecially with a view to seeking ice  free winter quarters suchas at Reval, is receiving attention,   This view  is  emphasised in view of the recent peace with Estonia,  whioh it is statedincludes secret clauses denying  that country*s ports toenemies of the Soviet,   The danger to Finland if this ideamatures is obvious.                       BAT.iT 10.Latvia.    SnN*0. Baltic reports that the peace treaty prohibitsthe use  of territorial waters of either contracting party by warships  of any nation whose aim is armed opposition,&apos;or who is ina state  of war with either contracting party, providedcontracting party is aware of the war&apos;or intended aggression.                     SOUTH RUSSIA.         The Battleship &quot;IMPERATRITSA MARIA&quot; has been sold(presumably by General Wrangel) for breaking up.         C-in-C. Mediterranean has been informed that no action is to be taken to support General Wrangel until the  result ofthe Conference at Minsk between Poland &quot;and Soviet Russia isknown and considered,   Arrangerents should, however, be madefor the  despatch of stores, fuel, etc.,  whioh can be provided from Naval sources in case it should be  decided to supportGeneral  Wrangel,   C-in-C Mediterranean requests that additionalminesweepers be sent out for operations  in Black Sea waters.New minefields have been laid off Odessa and Ochakov and othersmay be expected elsewhere.                        FINLAND.                               ^         It is reported that the Gulf of Finland demarcationlines to be observed during the forthcoming Armistice with soviet Russia are as follows:-         Russian men-of-war are to keep to the Eastward ofmeridian of East Longitude 28 degrees, 2 minutes, and to theSouthern part of the Gulf and Petrograd Bay.   Finnish men-of-war when East of this meridian are to keep to the Northern endof the Gulf of Finland and Petrograd Bay.  &apos; For commercialvessels, trawlers, etc., the clause appears to&apos;be framed to confine Russian ships to the Southern part of the Gulf off inland, and Finnish vessels to the North side if going East ofmeridian 28 degrees.   No clause is announced which restrictsthe use of Finnish ports by Foreign men-of-war.                        GERMANY.         It has been arranged, with reference to the  325,000tons of Shipping; under construction at the time of  theArmistice, that these vessels are to be completed at  the  expenseof Germany, and the Allies are to receive 225,000 tons. 1  Thevessels to be handed over include the &quot;BISMARCK&quot; which  will  bethe largest vessel in the world, and the &quot;TIRPITZ&quot;  of 20,800tons.HOLLAND.
                    HOLLAND.         The ex German battleship &quot;RHEINLAND&quot;  has arrivedat Vlaardingen to be broken up.    She was purchased from theBritish Government.         Vice Admiral Umbgrove has been appointed 0.  in 0.Dutch Indies, and has left for his station.                     DANUBE.         Trie first meeting of the International  Conferenoe  todecide the Statut definltif of the Danube was  held in Parison August 2nd.         It is  probable that  the Naval Advisers  at theConfer enoe will be formed into a sub-committee 4  and given theduty of forming a report as to what should be  the limits  ofinternational waters on the Affluents of the Danube.                    UNTIED STATES.          An incident, whioh caused a little temporary friction between  Great Britain and the United States Government, tookplace during the past 10 days.    It appears that tho American &quot;Western Union Telegraph Company&quot; and the British &quot; WesternTelegraph Company&quot; agreed to lay  a cable between Barbados andMiami (Florida) for their mutual  benefit.   This cable wouldlink up  the U.S.A. with South America by means of the WesternTelegraph Company&apos;s existing Barbados-South America cable.          The  American Company undertook this work and charteredthe British Company^ Cable Ship  &quot;COLONIA&quot;.          The  arrangements, however, were come to without theknowledge or  consent of the United States Government and the &quot;COLONIA&quot; had actually set out with the object of carrying outher assigned task, when the United States Government came to hear of  it, and, being greatly incensed, intervened by takingthe unusual course of sending Naval forces to intercept theship and prevent the landing of the oable &quot;by force if necessary&quot;.          This small incident was  given much prominence in- the-United States probably largely owing to the representationsand insidious suggestions of rival American TelegraphCompanies, backed by the TT,S. Government.          It is believed the matter will be settled amicably,probably by the U,S, permitting the laying of the cable up to 1the limits of u.S* territorial waters (outside which they have in fact  no legal Jurisdiction), and that further action willbe deferred Until legal rights have been sought by the TelegraphCompanies concerned, and considered by the U.S. Government.                         JAPAN.         The Naval Estimates for 1020-21 have passed the Diet.Approval has beer, given for a new programme of constructioncovering; the next eight years.  - Details are not yet to hand.
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE^         H.M. Government is prepared to leave the existing british forces at Kasvin. and on the Hamadan line for thepresent, and to re-inforoe them if necessary,   It is expectedthat Menjil -vd.ll shortly he re-oocupiod hy the British.         The Persian situation is still delicate but is showingsigns of improvement.         Kuchik Khan states that he has severed his relationship with the Bolsheviks on account of their Communistic ideas.  Hehas withdrawn frop Resht to Jrwli.   It is hoped that he will now co-operate with the forces which are being&quot; sent to dealwith the Bolsheviks as soon as they advance into Gilan.         The original Russian Bolshevik detachment which came -to-take the ships has left Persia.                    MESOPOTAMIA.         The situation has improved slightly.  Reinforcementshave arrived at Baghdad from India.         In the recent fighting during the advance fromDiwaniyah to RLllah the Arabs sustained severe casualties.                           I                      FINLAND.         The Armistice between the Russian Soviet Governmentand Finland will shortly be signed.   The terms will be for7)0 days, with 10 days notice of intention to resume hostilitieson either side;         The visit of British warships to Helsingfors ismaterially assisting good relations with the Finns, and, itis reported, has caused great uneasiness at Petrograd.                     SOVIET RUSSIA.         The peace negotiations between Poland and theBolsheviks have not yet started.   The delegates were expectedto meet at Minsk on Saturday, 14th. August.   Meanwhile theRed Array is slowly and surely approaching Warsaw.   Theconquered territory is being Sovietised.   The situation hasonce more become critical  and is more complicated in view ofthe French divergence in polic:/ with, regard to theirrecognition of General Wrangel*    The Bolshevik TradeDelegates remain in London, but negotiations continue suspended.                         BALTIC.Latvia.   Peace was signed with Soviet Russia on 11th August.SOUTH RUSSIA

Corroborative reports state the Bolsheviks are becoming apprehensive of General Wrangel&apos;s operations, owingto his power cf consolidating captured territory.         The French Government::.have taken over the responsibleity of supplying General Wrangel with arms and munitions.  The&apos;necessary arrangements have been made by the MilitaryAuthorities to hand over captured Bulgarian munitions to theFrench, but no action is to be taken pending further instructions.Azerbaijan.   Latest information concerning British prisonersof war at Baku states that they are now confined in&apos;a house.They are being moderately well looked after but suffer fromthe intense heat and vermin-   They request soap and tobaccoand vermicide *   Consul Hewelke  has had a paralytic stroke.M. Litvinov states that he will  do all he can A &quot;* accelerate the release of prisoners.         The civil population at Baku are stated to be inrevolt against the Soviet Government, and serious riots havetaken place.                      GERMANY.         The Reichstag passed an emergency law for the abolitionof conscription and military justice, and regulating the lengthof service,, against the vot -s of the German Nationals and partof the German people-s part,                      AU^RIA.

The Economic boycott of Hungary has been raised.The first direct train between Budapesth and Vienna ran on 9th August.                      POLAND:&apos;         The Polish Delegates were received by the Russianoutposts early on the 14th August and proceeded to Minsk.   Thepress correspondents vrere turned back.         Hostilities are still in progress and a fierce battleis raging for Warsaw,                                                     ITALY.
                     ITALY.         Italy has now completely turned the tables on Greeceby her voluntary abandonment of Albania and her publicchampionship of Albanian territorial integrity and independence.Greece claims Southern Albania (Epirus) and Jugoslavia wants alarge slice, including Durazzo, in the North.   Both are nowexposed to iheir claims being contested by the Albanians, with italy as their champion.   Albania has now become enthusiasticin friendship for Italy and a mission of Albanian notables issoon to come to Home.         Count Sforza, Minister of Foreign Affairs in his statement on Foreign policy said: &quot;I hold that the experiment&quot;of Russian Bolshevism should be allowed to run its course so&quot;long as tho Russians themselves can bear it.   Let it live or&quot;die by itself without being subject to martyrdonu   It is with&quot;this view that we agreed to cone to relations with Russia and&quot;their representative, 1&quot;* Vorowski is on his way to Rome.&quot;Whether the Russian people desire it or not, the fact is that&quot;the Bolshevik Government exists at Moscow and we must treat&quot;with it.   Europe cannot continue to live with the fiction&quot;that Russia does not exist&quot;.                    TRIPOLI.         The military situation becomes more unfavourable daily.Hostilities with the Arabs has been going on since the Italianstook over the province from the Turks, and the Italians havebeen forced to leave the interior.         The Italian Officers appear to be keen? but the menrefuse to undertake any operations in the interior.         The Governor of Tripoli has been recalled and a successor appointed-   The native rebel ^eader^ proposal isthat all Libya shall be united under an Egyptian Prince ofthe KhedSvial Family, with a Constitutional Government, Italyretaining some sort of Mandate.                     TURKEY.         Nationalist activity is now confined to minor raids,         Peace with Turkey having been signed, Mr. Max Mullerwill leave in about a month1 s time to relieve Admiral de Robeckas High OornmissiOi         Ratification of the Treaty will probably not be deposited for some 2 or 3 months.&apos;  Meanwhile the conditionsof the Armistice with Turkey will continue to apply.         An Italo-Greek Protocol, known as the tripartite agreement, which concerns the British,, French and Italianspheres of influence in Asia Minor was signed at the same time.                     BULGARIA.         The harvest has been exceptionally good and greatquantities of grain are stored  at Varna, Burgas and trie Danubianports ready for export.SYRIA &amp; PALESTINE.
                     UNITED STATES,         The United States repudiates all recognition of theSoviet Government and considers that no settlement can takeplace until a representative Government of the Russian people is formed.         She believes that all questions regarding RussianSovereignty over territory of the former Empire should be held &apos;in abeyance until this representative Government Is formed.         The refusal to recognise the Baltic and Trans-CaucasianStates is instanced.,-while recognition of Armenia is qualifiedby the decision that its boundaries should not be finally determined vjithout Russian agreement.         Finland and ethnic Poland are recognised *                         MSXTC0*                 -  -         It has now been authoratively announced that GeneralVilla has surrendered and has been granted a free pardon by the mexican Government;  also a years pay has been given to all hisfollowerSo         The Mexican Government propose tojwatch him closely,but they consider that the operations against him-which wouldhave been entailed by the refusal of a free pardon would havebeen too costly to. contemplate-.         The Presidential election recently took place in thisRepublic and resulted in an overwhelming victory for theformer President, Dr0 Belisario Porras,         It is understood that this result meets with thecordial approval of the U.S. and that the new President willbo formally inaugurated on October 1st,                                                      i                                                      i                 SYRIA AND PALESTINE.  -   &apos;         Tho British Government is  doing everything in its power to hasten Feisal1 s departure  from  Palestine,    TheItalian Government is &quot;being urged to give facilities for  hisjourney, and permission to enter Italy.    His  brother, the emir Zoid, will probably accompany  him to Europe *         The French Government repudiates the  suggestion  thatit is endeavouring to extend French influence  into  the Britishsphere.         In connection with the Syria-Palestine boundary, adeputation from the Sheikhs of Hauran has arrived at Jerusalemto&quot;&quot; ask for British protection.
