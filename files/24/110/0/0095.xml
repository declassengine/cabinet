) o G &apos;&apos;n i r i itrty ofSECRET.MINISTRY    OF    FOOD.mStatistical Statement  for  Month of July  1920.5     With the approaching end of the cereal year, stocks of cereals fell sharply during july, with the notable exception of wheat.   Supplies of feeding stuffs were also lowerfrom seasonal  causes.  There  was a return to the heavy imports of meat of  a  fewmonths ago, which, however, were not fully reflected in the stocks in cold store at theend  of the month.   Otherwise the supply position remained generally unchanged.     The  statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on 1st August still show an advance in the average retail prices of foodstuffs, the percentage increase since July,1914, rising from 158*1 on 1st July to 161&apos; 5 on 1st August.  There were increases in home-killed meat, imported mutton, bacon, fish, and eggs.   The only important decreasewas  in the case of potatoes, but it was  so considerable that the net  increase  on  theaverage was only 3*4 points.
