This  document is the property ol His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.   -               ,  &apos;      &apos;  q                   A1&apos;.                               THE CABINET.REINFORCEMENTS FOR MESOPOTAMIA.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.    I circulate herewith a copy of a telegram  which has been  sent by the War Officeto the  General  Officer Commanding-in-Chief,  Mesopotamia,  on the question  of themilitary requirements in Mesopotamia.                                                                   W. S. C.  THE WAR OFFICE, ,        800 July, 1920.       From War Office to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia.(No. 85768, cipher.  D.M.O.)             ,      Despatched 28th July, 1920, 2045.     1. Reference your No. X 9577, dated 26th  July, you state that in your opinionbefore the situation in the country can  be established a second division may possibly berequired.     You stated in your No. X 9436 of 15th July that you would probably be compelledto ask for  one full division,  but  when arrangements to provide this division were in train, vide our No. 85641 of 17th  July, we were compelled to modify that decision as aresult of your No. 9473, dated  18th July, in which you  requested us to postpone thedespatch of more than one brigade.     You ask, however, in your No. X 9560  of 24th July, that  divisional staff and ancillary services  should be sent at earliest  opportunity, we assumed, therefore, thatyou anticipate asking for the remainder of the division at an early date.     2. The despatch of the above division would exhaust all reserves which at present we have in sight,  and  we think  that in this connection  you. should see telegramNo.  8681 (private) from  Civil Commissioner, dated  19th July, in which he stronglydeprecates the provision of additional formations.     3. From your  No. X 9577, dated 26th July, we note that  you are furnishingdetailed  wires for personnel, &amp;c,  on the assumption that a second division  will berequired.  You should, however,  clearly understand  that- the provision of any suchdivision is  extremely problematical, and that as regards Ordnance and Royal ArmyService Corps personnel, we are at the end of our resources.     4. You should, therefore, in consultation with the  Civil  Commissioner, decide on  adefinite course of policy, bearing in  mind the limitations of our military resourcesmentioned above.  If you consider that further troops are required,  the only  possible means  of obtaining them will be  by  the withdrawal ,of  outlying detachments inMesopotamia itself, or withdrawal  from Persia, either wholly or in part.   The latter question will shortly be considered by the Cabinet, and we must be in a position to put the military position clearly before them.     5. Whilst your difficulties in the situation are fully appreciated, we think that itshould he possible  for  the civil and military authorities on  the spot to  arrive at an agreed appreciation of the  political situation /on which you can estimate  your military requirements and formulate a definite military policy, including the number  of dayssupply reserves considered essential.     6. We regard it as essential from a military point of view that to meet unforeseenemergencies you should dispose of  some reserve in your own hand over and above thetroops  necessary  to meet your visible  military requirements at any particular  time,more especially in view of  the length of time which must necessarily elapse before anyreinforcements from India or elsewhere can reach you.  In default of  such a reserve weforesee that the  present  state of uncertainty and the necessity for expensive anduneconomical emergency  measures  must continue for. an indefinite period, which isinadmissible both  from a financial and military point of view.
