I,   / ,JLFUR&apos;    358THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY 0?  HIS  BRITANNIC MU^TTS  government ECRETCP,  1771                                                   J                            CABINET                      THE  IRISH &quot;SITUATION           MEMORANDUM  BY  S0II01T0R-GBIIER;,L FOR IR ;1AND                  (Circulated  for Information)                                               I .     1,         I  believe  that  any form  of Self-Government for          Ireland will be -               (1)  a disaster  lor Ireland.                     (the only Members  of the Present Parliament                      who join in the belief are the Unionist                      Members  from Ulster and Mr.  Jellett,  the                      Member for Dublin University).               (2)  a danger to the&quot; Empire,                      (the  above $embers and the extreme Sim Eein                      Members agree and the lajr^or intend  this to                      be so).                   Notwithstanding above I have come to the con-          clusion that subject to the Premiers three fundamental          conditions (viz.(l)  Recognition of the Crown;  (2) the          necessity for securing the Defence of the Realm,  and          (3)  the autonomy  of  Ulster) it is not only wise but ne-          cessary that an offer should  be made now (before  we start          on the  exeroise of the new powers granted to suppress          orime and restore law and order) of the  fullest measure          of self-government to the 26  counties known as Southern          Ireland.                                Reasons,               (1)  The Union  can only  be maintained when you have a          practically  unanimous Great Britain, determined to maintain          it,  and an absolutely unionist executive in Ireland to carry          out  that determination.  This condition  of things existed
 up to 1885 but since that time it has ceased to exist and will never be restored till (if ever) Great Britain is convinced that it is necessary for her own safety.      (2)   Great Britain alone can maintain the  Union and Great Britain as represented  in this  Parliament is1 unanimous that it shall not be maintained,  and  the  Government Bill for  the  Better  Government of Ireland  is  conclusive that it will  not and  cannot be maintained  under present political conditions.      (3)   I fear that  the  effect  on the Irish i&amp;eoutive Police etc. of the proposal to  set up a parliament  in Ireland for the  26 counties is  not appreciated  by british members of parliament.  An Executive officer in GreatBritain,   India  or iiigypt knows that if ha undertakes ahazardous duty and carries it through he will be supportedby Great Britain and looks forward to coming home to spend the evening of hie life amongst friends in Great Britain.In Ireland the police, and magistrates etc. are  asked to do their duty at the risk of their lives, every hour of everyday and night, and they know that if they Burvive they willhave to live with their wives and families in Irelandm&amp;rkod out as the enemies of the Irish Race.  In fact theyare asked to run the risk of being shot daily in order thatin a short time  they may be put under the rule  of thepeople they now arrest and prosecute and thereby be condemnedto face ruin for themselves and their families.   Sven iftney were all out and  out Unionists they could not carryon under those circumstances and ae now in every departmentof Government the majority are Nationalists it  ie ludiorouBto expect them to carry on.  Already there have been 07er500  resignations from  the Police and it is thought by thosebeet qualified  to judge that the groat majority, if not all,will have reeigned by  next October unless  something la done.
      U)   Sir William V. Haroourt when introducing the Kzplosives Bill  in 1883 pointed out that the only instru- mente a civilized government had to deal with outrage and  crime  were  (1) the police and ( ) the punishments of the  Law.   We are faoed with the gravest, most successful and  best organized rebellion that ever existed in Ireland They carry out the death penalty ruthlessly on all useful or active  mempers of the police etc. and almost with entire impunity so far.   We have now more drastic powers to suppress and restore law and order than any Irish executive  ever possessed.   All this will be useless if, as stated  above, the police fail us and the condition of Ireland will be worse infinitely than at present,     (5)  Subject to the Premier1s three fundamental conditions it matters nothing to the inhabitants, es- pecielly the Unionist and  Protestant inhabitants of the 26 counties what powers their Parliament possess,whether restricted as in the Government Bill or any form of Constitutional Dominion Home xiule.   The individuals who will m&amp;n that Parliament will all be Sinn Seinersand  the entire administration of the 26 counties will be in their hands.  Administration will affect the people living there as much or  more than Legislation,   TheUnionists  there have counted the cost and now7 would prefer to be put under Sinn Fein than remain under the present conditions.     (6)  The offer should be made now instead of later. I had a letter this morning from a distinguished South of Ireland gentleman whom I asfced to tell ma how things are  getting on the R.T..  His reply was &quot;The answer is in the  affirmative.&quot;  They are getting on.  Svery day that
passes  over my head convinces me more and more thatthio dreadful nightmare should be put an end to by giving  some form of Government to this country (Ireland)whioh the Country North and South will aooept and workand the tragedy of it all is that it might have beeniom I  believe and that it must and will be doneI think after much blood and tears.&quot;     (7)  If the offer is made and acoepted and provesa sucoees it will disprove the foundations of mybelief.  If it is refused or proves a danger to theEmpire we may again get a united Groat Britain infavour of restoring tho Union and a loyal Unionist(instead of as at present at best a half-hearted andhopeless) Executive in Ireland to maintain to theutmost by all means,  no matter how severe,  law andorder in Ireland.                    (SD) D.M.WILSON,                     Solicitor General for Ireland.August 11th, 1920.
