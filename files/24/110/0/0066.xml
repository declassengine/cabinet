In addition there are a large number of purely        temporary messengers paid at the  above rates, who are        almost entirely ex-Service men/and many  of whom are In        possession of a disability pension.        fold Class Messengers )        Tsjj Class MessengersJ - permanent established classes        appointed-by Ministers for the most part  (subject to a        qualifying examination of an elementary character)  - whose        remuneration varies in different  offices,  but averages from        a minimum of  70 or  80 per annum to a maximum of  120 to         130 per annum.             2,  The Royal Commission recommended that the  established        class of messengers should only be employed in attendance        on Ministers, and the more important permanent officials                                            work        and that all tho other messengerial  / should be performed        by &quot;pensioner&quot; messengers/ who should remain on  an  uncstablishod        basis **             3. Tt is considered that this recommendation  is        somewhat too sweeping, and that men. of the established class        are also required for supervision and for responsible        individual dutics.
4.   It is therefore proposed that tho messengerservice in future should be organised in two grades, oneestablished, for the duties indicated above, and oneunestabli3hed for all&apos;other work that falls to be carriedout by messenger a.   The remuneration proposed forjthesc twogrades has not boon finally settled ponding the result ofa claim on behalr of the oxisting temporary messengerspaid at the &quot;pensioner&quot; rate, but a scale of  90-2.10* 100- 5- 130 has boon suggested for the established class, andone of 27/- 1/- - 32/- per weok for the uneatabllshedtogether with war bonus in each case.   In addition bothclasses will receive payment for overtime at appropriaterates for all hours of attendance in excess of 48 per week.     It is further proposed that uniform on thousual scale should bo supplied to both sraC.es*5.   Tilth regard to recruitment of the unostablishodgrade, it Is considered that posts In this class shouldbe reserved entirlly for ex-Scrvico men with either adisability or a long service pension.     Tilth regard to the established class it&amp;sconsidered that vacancies,  should bo filled by promotionfrom tho unestablishod class and not by the patronageof Ministers an at pre sent, and authority is sought forthis change^6-,  &apos; In announcing in 1915  b*y a Circular to Departmentstho Government^ decision  to employ unostablishodpensioner mosseniors for general messenger work  throughouttho Service, the Treasury  expressed the hope that departments would &amp;ive careful consideration to  the qualifications of Pensioner Messengers already  in their service for appointment to such established post3 as  mlf.;htbo retained before  filling thoso   oo3ts  from outside  tho                                                      Service
       Service *   In various forms this recommendation has       been made for over 40 years, but it has in practico       had Very little effect, and the introduction of       individuals with no claim on tho public to the       exclusion of the ex-Servico  pensioner ha3 always boon a       matter of anxiety, in particular to the War Office,                . It is thought^ in view of past experience,       that nothing but a firm rule on the method of filling       vacancies in tho established grade will.suffice, and,       for the success of the reorganisation, a rule on tho       lines now proposed is regarded as very necessary..       It is esser.Ual that, if the best type of ex-servico       man is to be obtained, he should have  from tho       beginning of his service the prospect  ultimately of       appointment to the higher grade, carrying with it the       benefits of establishment.   Such an outlet to establishment       is not only needed, but can be justified by analogous       practice in the case of other Civil Service classes,.                It is proposed that unestablished messengers       should be eligible for appointment to  established       posts up to the age of 45, except in the case of       long service pensioners when the limit  will be 50,       In the case of unestabllshed messengers promoted to       the established grade without a break, one half of       their continuous service in the lower  grade will be       reckoned for pension.
