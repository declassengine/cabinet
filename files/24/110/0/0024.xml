There is some- repetition in the ,fu33 r/report,  which-was1    written first) .    It is not an agreeable task to criticise,  and still less to express unhopeful.views as to the future of a people whose hospitality one has enjoyed: and whose- confidence one hasreceived at a moment of national anguish, when the very ex-istence of the people was threatened by a red terror,     bythe.invasion of one of those barbarous hordes, which at longIntervals of history have swept from the Fast, into Europe.    I should, however, be false to : the British Government andto. truth itself, if I allowed personal sympathies to bias my judgment, and the following summary contains an unvarnishedstatement of the views I have formed during my six days&apos; visit to Warsaw(l)   The Polish Government are sincerely anxious to have peace,     and will make considerable sacrifices to achieve it.  As    , a nation, however, they are unaccustomed to look facts in    - the face, and there is always the danger that their san-     guine temperament may lead them to&apos;over-rate some local    ..military success, and to adopt an attitude in the armistice     or .peace negotiations which  is not justified by the real    .,military position.  In. this  respect the French are a bad    , -combination with the poles.^  -Lord D^Abernon had a diffi-     cult task to keep the polish&apos;Government in the right    - frame of mind to accept an armistice without allowing    &apos; them to lose heart or to check their military preparations.(2)   The polish. Army is not so much beaten as-demoralised.    - -The ill-advised advance to Kieff, and the. inevitable    ; retreat have reacted disastrously on this young and    : inexperienced army.  They have sustained no - great defeats,     and no heavy battle casualties, but in the. :long returned re-    . ment through the- vast plains of Russia,: the widelyThis- re pert only expressed my personal views. . It was -writtenafter I-left-Warsaw and there are several questions -dealt vdth onwhich I had no opportunity for,-discussion with 1,-9rd D1 Aberncn andGeneral Radcliffe.
    scattered units have gradually, become  dissipated.    separated from their units,  men have  either been taken    prisoner, or lost their way,  or gone  back  to,their homes.    The result is that units are reduced  to  a  tithe of their    strength and there are not nearly enough men  available to    hold a semblance of a line.(3)  As fighters the Bolshevist infantry are  probably inferior    to the poles.  They have, however, considerable quantities    of cavalry, or rather mounted infantry with machine-guns in    a fair state of discipline and led by  officers of the old    Russian Army.  these move constantly  round the flanks of the    poles and through the gaps in their lines, with the result    that the poles are manoeuvred out of  one position after    another,  one result is that the  polish  troops are in a    state of complete exhaustion.  The Bolshevists are less    tired as they have sufficient troops  to  enable divisions to    be taken out for a rest. The Poles unfortunately have not    enough reserves to effect a  roulement.(4)  The&quot;above process has continued for weeks.  There has been    no cessation of the retreat  and no time  to re-organise the    army, incorporate drafts, and devise  and carry out new systems    of tactics which,, at present,  the officers-and men are too    raw and inexperienced to assimilate.  . .(5)  one result is that the soldiers have lost  confidence in the    Higher command,  and the Higher Command has lost confidence    in itself.  The  Staff is composed, mainly  of  officers of the    former Austrian Ar^jy,  which  had an unbroken tradition of    defeat, and is inefficient.   The  regimental officers are    also of indifferent quality  and, - it is stated, often lead the    retreat.(6)  political influences are too strong in military matters.  At    a time when v/warsaw was completely uncovered,  troops were    still being sent to Eastern  Galicia.   The  reason for this.    faulty disposition, I &quot;believe,  was that  under the Grabski    Agreement, the Bolshevists in the Forth  would have to fall    back 5o kilometres beyond the armistice  line, whereas in. the    south the troops would.stand where they  were  on the date of    the signature of the armistice,  so all  the troops were   ..  .    sent to $astern Galicia in. order  to get  a  good armistic%    line there,and the utmost risk was run to  Warsaw itself.(7)  The rear of the army is in. great  disorder. There are masses    of stragglers and deserters, and, until  they  reached    Warsaw itself, little seems  to have been done to round them    up.  Thousands of men were collected  in  Warsaw during our.    visit,  it is reputed that.some officer  deserters and two    Generals have been shot..(8.)  Behind this disorganised army a real  national movement has    lately sprung up, and there  is much talk of fighting to    the last.  A Rational Coalition Government has been forced,    and the Diet h&amp;s, in order to secure  rapidity in legislation,    handed over its powers to a  committee of National Defence    in which  the various parties are  represented  only by one    representative apiece.  Fair numbers.of  volunteers have come    forward and it is hoped to  raise 100,000 men  by this method.    Strikes for the moment have  ceased.   It  is doubtful, however    whether the present national unity has its roots laid    sufficiently deep,  its duration is problematical..  The    machine of the Government is complicated and  a low.. The    importance of promptitude and punctuality  is  not realised in    the polish Administration.   There is  some  dread of Bolshevist
        fright -fulness,  and for  this  reason I  doubt  if  in  the  long        run the  talked-cf partisan warfare could  be sustained.   A        little real  terror would  extinguish itc ^($)   No  really competent loader has  yet appeared,   Marshal Pil*        s-us&amp;united,  the  Eesd  cf the. State t,  is  a vain  person^  without any        real  military trailing, but  clever, an intriguer,  and more        dangerous cot of  office than in.    So far as I eould  judge,        Witoe,.the theatrical peasant, prime Minister,  is  a nonentity.        Some  of  the  men who make  the best  impression of competence :.        are under suspicion of  pro-Germanism  or worse *  (10)   There is sufficient man-pOwer to continue the  stru^0le  for        some  time^ provided arms  and equipment can  be  maintained.-        Both a ccmpulsoiy and a voluntary  method  of enlistment  are  in        operation,-  (11)   There is a shortage of  most  forms  of  war  material,  boots, and      .  clothing.

The Ddr..?.i&amp; ior.tav  therefore, is at        present  being kept open only by the u S3 of   itish soldiers to        urload the ships.   Admittedly,  thJs is only a  provisional and        risky expedient.   It was  only adopted in  the very last  resort,        and after  the consent of  the German dor,keis had been  obtained,        owitig. to the critical urgency cf the  military  and political. sit-        nation.   If  Poland is to  maintain,  wdg s triple, it is fuuua-        mental that  some  more permanent provisioh should  be made for        keepin&amp;  opon DanzigI -  (lo)  To  meet  the  above situation  the following steps were  taken  by        the Polish Government and the. Anclo-J?rench  Mission;-        (2.).General  Woy^and was attached as military advisor  to the            Polish Chief  of the General Staff, and  the.pojisL Govern-            ire.pt decided  that his advice must in  all circumstancoe  bo            adopted^.        (b)  The. officers  of tho French.Military Mission^  who  had            scarcely been, utilised up to &amp;a..teowin0 to the vanity            and  ignorance of the  Poles, were  attached  to  the  various[commands.   In one case a French General Officer (Spioi)            was  &amp;iven command- of  an  army-i      &quot; (o)  The  Polish  defects1 in war material were ascertained and.            examined by.General Wey0and and General padcliife and            fciwar&amp;ed to  their  respective  War. Offices, which  wore  asked            to arrange  together to supply  them as far  as  possible.
  &apos;     The jn-eaeuroje^^                         to p&amp;m-xg were&apos;       taken, with rumie&amp;iiate and almost electrical of feet, on the       m rale of the polish G overrent and people? and the ar-      - v       HvaTef the arms will le of groat material value,  in       addition. the British and French Governments were asked      to take VP shipping for tho supply of Danzigo    (o) General Wey^and was instructed immediately to take up with       the Chief of the P6l:*oh General Staff the $reparation cf a       p3an, and the concentration of a force for the defence of&apos;       Warsaw;   The general conclusions to which 1 am led are as followsJ-     Havlng regard to tho shattered condition of the Polish Army,due-&quot;to the ceaseless retreat over more than 200 miles, the state ofits armament, the weakness of the High Military Command, Staff, andAdministratioh, the vain and feokl.ess character of the nation.; the weakness due to tho three nationalities of which the polish raceconsists, the detestation of Poland &quot;by all its neighbours, and theprecarious nature of its communications with the outside world9 I donot think it is poseibllo for the Allies, in the time available.to place polaod in a condition to resist for long a&apos; continued attack by the Bolshevists,  7. doubt if General )7eygand will have timeto make his personality felt through the &quot;chain of incompetence, vanityand passive resistance which oonueocs him with the front line ofthe Army.     Peace is therefore of the first importance and Poland ought .tomake great sacrifices to obcain it,  &apos; To secure peace the lever of a?refusal of &quot;Grading relations with Soviet Russia is far more powerfulthan any military assistance which the Allies can give to Poland,In a military sense the best that can DO hoped for is to postpone thefinal crash until other forms of influence can be brought to bearon the Bolshevists.  If sufficient time can,somehow be gained it is just possible that tho Polish Army might be&apos; put in a state to con-.tinne the war.  Most observers agree that the men are good fightingmaterial,  if given a chance; and history confirms this,     If,  however,  the independence of Poland cannot be secured bypeace negotiations, and tho allies decide to support Poland in the continuation of the war, in the hone of getting better terms later,on, the best form, which allied military assistance can take locallyis as follows:. -(a) Selection of the best available  soldier to give military advice    to the Pole;  As soon as the Poles can be induced to accept&apos; it,    the selected officer,  whether General Weygand or some other,    should be given definitely the post of Ohief of the Polish G-general   -    al.Staff,   Advantage should be taken of any opportunity to induce    Marshal Pilsudski to hand over to this officer the Chief Command,    himself retaining,  as Head of the State,  the nominal coenmand.,    such  as was enjoyed,  for-example,  by the  Xing&apos; of Italy,  through-    out the farr,(tO  As arranged by the Anglo-French  Mission,  the utmost possible  use    should.be  made  of the  officers of the  ifronoh Military Mission,    and the  number  of these  should be increased as soon as they can    effectively be  used,.   Ultimately,  there should,  if possible,  be    French Officers  in  every Battalion-   This  should be insisted  on:(c)  Bo British troops should be  sent to  Poland,   No  British officers    should be  sent  for-the present,  and  they  should  not be sent    at all until the, Higher  Military Command  shows some sign of cap-    aoiiy.   I  would  not  take the  responao.bil.ity of exposing  the    lives of Britisli officers in the present  chaos of confusion and    incapacity.
(d)  Th^ British government,  as  a  Soa power,  should  take  as  its    sphero the entiro  control of  the Port  of Danzig,  including the    Docks, inland waterways  and railways up  to  the  polish boundary.    The consent of the Allied Powers and of  the Council  of  the League    of Nations should  bo  obtained to this  as soon uo  possible,    The mere.-announcement of suoh a policy)  accompanied  by  some    declaration by our Labour Leaders *  might bring  the Danzig dockers    to reasons(f)  The Polish Government should be  allowed  to  enlist British  cit-    izens at their own risk for  technical  services,  such as  lying,    tanks, &amp;o.(g)  The co-operation of other  nations  such as Lithuania, Finland, and    Roumania,  should not be sought without careful  investigation by    the General Staff of the military  capacity  of  those nations, and    without ascertaining dofinitely  that  their  needs in matters of    war material,of all kinds  and assistance can be  met.  It would    be criminal to engulf these  States unless there  is a reasonable    probability of a good result.(h)  Luring the present critical  phase  in  Poland a  British man-of-war    should always be at Danzig to support the High Commissioner in    the maintenance of order,  and to impress Northern Europe,  through    the medium of the mass of  agents established  there by BolshoY--    ist Russia and various Baltic States,     If Soviet Russia persists in the offensive our efforts to savePoland will, probably fail.  The Eussian,boundary will then marchwith that of Germany, who is anxiously watching the situation.  an understanding between the two countries will ensue.  Germany will seek to obtain Upper Silesia, the corridor,  Danzig, and the wheatof the Ukraine, estimated at 10 million tons,   Eussia will obtainlocomotives and rolling-stock, agricultural  implements, and incourso of time other manufactures worked up  from her own raw mater-ials.

PAR T..  II.SUMMARY.. OF PROCEEDINGS.;I was asked-to join.Lord D&apos; Abernon1s. Mission on July 20,1920.- We left Waterloo  the  same  evening  for Paris with.the f0Hewing instructions:-     that Lord L^Abemon (the  British Ambassador, in Berlin),,accompanied by a: Military Officer to  be nominated by theArmy Council - (Sir Maurice Hankey. was subsequently invited-tb accompany the Mission).,    should be  irivited to.proceedto Poland, in conjunction with  a  similar.  Me no h Mission,,  as k Special Envoy to- advise His.  Majestyrs;  Government&apos; as  to themeasures to be tafcan with the Polish  and  other  governments on questions arisirig out of the negotiatibns with regard  tothe conclusion of.&quot;an armistice  between Poland and Svviet  Russia2.  Immediately after our arrival in  Paris we saw M.  Millerand,in company with General  Weygand,.  M. Berthelot,:  and other  of-ficials of&apos; the French foreign Office.  M.. Millerand at  cnceaccepted to cooperate in the.Mission,, ahd nominated general weygand as the military  member.-.  Later in. the. day .he  nominatedM..- Jusserand,. the French Ambassador in Washington,, and  M.Vignon,. his own. Chef Adjoint de Cabinet,  as  the civilian, re-. presentative-,3.  In Paris we had long conversations with  M. PMor,o.w&amp;ka whohad just been appointed  as a Polish planipotentiary to  at-.  .tend all International Conferences,. and to take deoisions for.the welfare- of his country.  He gave  us much valuable inform-ation whioh was in nearly every respect confirmed by our  ei-periences in Poland.  We  also saw other well-informed Poleswho also gave us useful  informatlon..  Sr.. Benes,  the. Czecho-Slovak Poreign Minister,  also threw, some  useful light on  thesituation in Poland.,4.  We left Paris on July 21 at 9 p,n, inoompany with  theFrench Mission..  We had  arranged:  with the French Governmentto have two Wagon-L.it s coaches  and a.  Restaurant Car,  as wehad been informed that accommodation  was  very difficult toOb sin at&apos; Warsaw-  In view of. the threatening Military  sit-.uation in. Poland^also it see mod advisable  to  provide  this
 accommodation to secure our retreat in oase -of necessity, and we ensured that our train was amply provisioned.  As a matter of fact,  part of the Staff of the Mission slept in  the train during our stay at Warsaw,  and we used it to a cer-^ ain-extent as an Office and regularly as a rendezvous with our French, j) oil aagu^s,  with whom we maintained the most in- legitimate and cordial relations, 5.   At Prague,  where we had to spend several hours,  the Anglo- French Missions had a long talk with Dr. Masaryk,  the Presi-* dent of the Czechoslovak State.   He-was entirely pessimistic about the possibility of retrieving the military situation in  Poland.  Ho  considered that an army, after so disastrous a retreat, could not possibly recover its morale.   He did not conceal his apprehensions that the Allies,  by attempting the military rehabilitation of Poland, would merely be involved in  yet another  defeat at the hands of the Bolshevists;  which, following on the failure at Archangel,  in Siberia, in South Russia,  and in  the Caucasus, would react disastrously on their prestige  throughout Eastern Europe.  He was convinced that Bolshevism could only be fought by,means of Peace.  &quot;One locomotive&quot;,  he  said,  &quot;in Russia,  is worth more in overcoming Bolshevism than the- capture of a, Bolshevist battalion.&quot; Europe must demonstrate to Russia that the products of Western civilisation are essential to the well-being of the Russian people.   If the  Western Powers have a case against Bolshev- ism they must statn it  in. Russia itself.  Bolshevist propagan- da  must be !net  by western propaganda,  and. more especially by the unconscious propaganda of coramercial relations.   He was entirely in favour of-trading relations..  So convinced was  . he  of the futility of military action,  that even in Poland1s present d-espesi*t*l straits he considered that more would ber accomplished by  negotiation than by any military action.  He was confident that czecho-rilovakia, an advanced, &amp;emooraeyv composed largely of peasant proprietors, would not go Bolshevist
 and he made a  strong, statement, of  &quot;non-ijaterrention&quot;  by Czechoslovakia  in  the present  struggle, 6*  We had made  advance arrangements  to have news  sent to us at Prague and for British and French  Officers to. meet us at the Polish frontier.  The nearer we got to Warsaw the  worse was the news. 7.  We arrive! at Warsaw on the morning of Sunday, July 25, at 9 a.m.   We were received by a  Guard  of Honour, but ,beyond several Ministers and Officials there were few people about. The town of Warsaw  from this day and  throughout our stay was perfectly quiet, and up to the  date of my departure   July 30   there was no  sign of panic,  or  even of excessive de- pression.  The people seemed to be going about their  business in a perfectly normal manner.  The general state of mind of the populace, however,  will be dealt with later in the report, 8.  On the morning  of our arrival we  saw Prince Sapieha the Foreign Minister, and in the afternoon Marshal Pilsudski, the Head of the State,  and later, M. Witos,  the prime  Minister, and li, DaszynskI, Minister without Portfolio, accompanied by Prince Sapieha,  We had many interviews with the above Min- ministers,  as well as  With M. Grabski, General bosnokowski. ViceMinister of War, and other Ministers, during our stay, and on Tuesday,  July  27, we had a more formal conference  at  which important decisions were taken which, have been.telegraphed home.We made it our business to get  in touch with all persons likelyto be well-informed on the military or political situation, in- eluding General Bozovadosski,. the  Chief of the Polish General Staff, General Henrys the Head of the French Military Mission,the Head of the Italian Military Mission who was particularly well-informed,  Deputies to the Diet, Military Officers ofvarious nationalities, M. Dmowski, who recently resigned fromthe Council of National Defence, and  other private individualsof various sections of the population^   Some of these persons                 \   -     . . are described  in part HI. of this  report.
9. I do not propose to overload this report with details of ......all these conversations, but will pass at once to a generalappreciation of the situation.  I myself, in accordanOe with authority I had received from&apos; the Prime Minister,&apos; left Warsaw,as soon as I felt that,my services were no longer required.I travelled home via Danzig and Berlin,                     PA R T   III.                 THE POLITICAL SITUATION.           * .     ........................................ --.................MlU-........1110. Shortly before our arrival in Poland, a Coalition cabinet had been,;formed to secure unity&apos;.in the conduct of the War. TheChief of the State, Marshal Pilsudski, who appears, untilquite recently virtually to have had the whole control of theGovernment and also of the Army&apos; in his hands, seemed nominally,at any, rate, to.have ceded direction into the hands of theCabinet.  He more than once informed members of the Missionthat he was not in control and that the Ministers were now re-sponsible.  It seems probable that he desired to shift-on&apos;toother shoulders some of his own-responsibility-for&apos; the disastrous-trous condition.of his country.11. The Cabinet meets frequently but&apos;though.its meetings  are extremely prolonged, the real work appears&apos;to be done&apos;by cabinet. Committees,.  For example, - there &quot;.is an,informal war committee, consisting of M.Dasz$mski,&apos; Minister&apos; without Port-folio, M.Grabskl, Minister of Finance, Prince Sapieha theForeign Minister, :M.Sosnoknowski, the .Vice Minister of War,and M. Skulski, the Minister  of the Interior,  There is also an Economic Committee presided over by M. Grabski.  Thereis a Cabinet kec.netfcry, M. Wrobleski, who has-been nominatedas the principal civilian  among the armistice negotiations.Unfortunately I did not meet him, but he Is  very highly spoken
12. Shortly&apos;before our arrival in Poland, the Diet went intorecess and nominated a so-called Council of National De-fence, to which It devolved its responsibilities.  this measure was taken nominally at any rate to facilitatetransaction of business.  The Council of National Defence ispresided over by Marshal Pilsudski, and $jusifets of 10 Seput-ies the Leaders of the Various Parties in the Diet, 6 Gen-erals, and 6 Ministers.  Apparently, nearly all the deci-sions of the Cabinet have to 1 e ratified by the Council ofNational. Defence.  The machinery, therefore, is rather com-plicated.  The real decision is taken in the informal war committee, which then has to persuade the Cabinet, and after-wards the Council of National. Defence to give their assent.These incessant meetings place a very heavy strain on Pol-ish Ministers, and this is the more the case that the meet-ings, both of the Cabinet and of the Council of National De-fence are of interminable length, often lasting far into theearly hours of the morning.13. The administration is cumbrous and works very slowly.For reasons which will appear later in this report, thePoles do not appreciate the importance of punctuality orpromptitude.                THS LEADING PERSONALITIES.14. Marshal Pilsudski, the Head of the State, is a verysingular personage. -His appearance is not an inspiring one.He is tall, but stoops so much about the shoulders as al-most to have the appearance of a hunch-back.  He wears a greenUniform.  His face is cadaverous with deep-set eyes, and in real life, as in all his photographs, he has appearance of deep depression.  His hair is auburn, and bristles up on the top of his head in the Gerraan fashion; hi3 moustache ofthe same colour is long and drooping; his head is narrow
especially at the top, coming almost to a point.  He hasa very pronounced chin.  He has had an adventurous career,which greatly appeals to the mass of the people.  He is byorigin an Austrian-Pole, and has spent much of his life inGaliola.  He has been nixed up in innumerable intrigues, andwas at one time sent to Siberia.  I belive he was in prisonin Austria when the war broke out.  Politically he is aSocialist.  One of the junior ministers told me that Pil-sudski had been a friend of Lenin, who also lived in Galiciabut I cannot guarantee the truth of this.  He is alleged to be violently anti-Russian.  During the War he raisedr;Polish Legion to fight for Austria against Russia.  Thisbrought him into contact with the Germans, who tried to make him and his legions take an oath of allegiance to the GermanEmperor.  He declined and was thrown into prison. When thearmistice erne in 1C18, and the Germans had to retire from poland, he got himself appointed as Head of the State, atitle which was subsequently ratified by the Polish Dietformed to make a Consliiutlon for Poland.  &quot;;hen the constituencies-ution is completed a reguler Presidential election will beheld.  At present it has passed j,ts first but not its secondreading, and Marshal Pilsudski remains as Head of the State.He has great military ambitions, and did not conceal to mem-bers of our Mission that his interests are almost entirely-military. &apos;&apos;Be has never graduated in any school of militaryinstruction, and has really no claim to be a professional&quot; sold-ier.  The best his friend, General Henrys, could 3ay in De-fence of his military prowess, was that he is deeply read inHapoleon1s campaigns, being familiar with them down to the smallest detail.  Until quite recently he has been entire mas-ter of the military as well as of the political situation.of Poland.  It is he, and he alone, who has devised the cam-paigns and supervised their execution.  Up to the present time
 the  information comes  first to  Marshal  Pilsudski,  and the General  Staff  &quot;.ften do not \now the  latest events  for 24 hours after  they are known to the entourage of  the  Marshal.,  He has  a  habit of sitting    very  late  at  niahi  and  sleeping until  late in  the  morning.  As  nothing  can be done without his  approval,  this often involves  undue delay even in mat- tors of  the greatest importance.   As a  rule,  he only visits the  front  when he  feels sure that  a  victory is coming off. Until  the  recent&apos; great retreat  he  was very popular with the soldiers,  and  it is  by no means certain Ma popularity  has really faded.   His photograph is far more  in  evidence in the shops  of vareaw than that of any other  Polish public man.  Ee is a man of rreat  personal bravery,  and 1  -was informed  that on one occasion he led  an attack in person,   Nothing  would induce him. to surrender the military command.  &apos;i&apos;he Anglo-French Mis- si on had early made  up their rdnds that,  as a council of per- fection  it was essenti-l  to got rid  of  the Marshal from the effective  Suprere  Command.   Our idea wss  to leave  him as Head of the State,  to leave him the  nominal  command of  the forces to the extent  that it  is  enjoyed.by  most  crowned Heads and Presidents, but  to insist as a condition  of Allied  sup- port,  that he  should hand over  the miixtary command to  some other  General,  such  as General  Joseph haller,  who  would be given  a French Chief of Staff.  All  the authorities that were consulted  on this  question,  however, whether  British, French, or Polish,  military  or -civilian, concurred that such action would  prove  disastrous.   Although his party,  the Socialist Party,  is  the  smallest one  in Poland, he, possesses  a powerful Press,  and  is  said to  have  control of a number .of  Secret Bo- cieties in  differeat parts  of the country,  between his Press,his Secret  Soci^ti3s,  and his personal  popularity,  he wouldmake the position  impossible  for his successor in  the military command.   Several  very well-informed people stated  that the change could not be  effected  without a  Revolution,  and  it was&apos;
eventually decided to adopt other measures which will be described later.  Some of Pilsudski*s enemies have the pro-foundest- suspicions of the good faith of the Karshsl, and be- 1lieve him to be in relations with the Bolshevists, but I heardno real evidence of this.  It -ps somewhat singular that, onthe day i left  Warsaw, when the enemy was not much more than80 miles from the city, avd the defending army was more orless broken, when the negotiators were leaving ,;warsaw forBaronovltch to try and arrange an armistice, Marshal Pilsudskileft for the Southern front, where an offensive was about tobe launched.  In combining the functions of a President ofa Republic. President of the Council of Ministers, Presidentof the Committee of National Defence, and Military Commander-in-Chief, he has attempted the impossible.15. The Prime Ministor, H. Witos, is a peasant.  He wears apeasant costume, that is to say a tpmotf suit, with browngaiters, but he prides hi-rself on never having worn a tie.Ivu their own style, his clothes are quite smart and he lookslike a stage peasant.  He does not speak a word of English,French or German, or  , indeed, any language except Polish. a tour interview, he spoke a word of welcome, but only after oneof the other Ministers had prompted him to do so.  It was in-teresting to see  Prince Sapieha interpreting for him    the prince the interpret  r for the peasant.  He does not pretendto have the experience necessary for a Prime Minister, andit is  stated that the real power lies with K. Rataj, the Min-ister  of Education, oa whom he implicitly relies.  I do notthink he takes  a very active part in the work of the Government.At any rate, he chose a some-whs-t critical period of our visit to retire to his farm to reap his crops not omitting to put out a communique to this  effect in the local Press. He leads the peasants&apos; Party,/thc  largest Party in the Diet, comprising110 members.    i
 PTE.   On my farewell visit to Prince Sapieha I met M.Patek in theante-room.  He was abou^Tto^enlist as a private soldier, and had beenfciven five days in which to arrange his private affairs. Daszynskl.  16. A more remarkable figure than the Prime. Miniatejrts^he          Minister without portfolio, M.Daszyn8ki..  He is a man of rather 1          impressive appearance, with a good head, and a ft ne sonoroua          Voice.  He has extremely polished manners and speaks French          and German v;ell.   He has peculiar shifty blue eyes.  He is          a Socialist and was a member of the Austrian Relehsrath,&apos; but          did not belong to the Polish Club.   He has the reputation of          being a strong pro-German, and is.intensely distrusted by the          French.  It is alleged that they have more than ence prevented          him from being made Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He&apos; is a very          inscrutable person, but we did not succeed in getting in closeI          touch with him.   At a dinner party given to us by Count Sapieha          I had some conversation with him and his attitude was quiteI          correct both as regards concluding an armistice and fighting toI          a finish if negotiations had to be broken off.   He concluded          with a somewhat cryptic remark that within 48 hours the situationj          would be much clearer to us all.   Within 48 hours came the          Eoishevist telegram to London announcing that theybwould attend          the London Conference.  I was,unable to secure a personal          appointment with him before leaving and Lord D!Abernon had not          succeeded in seeing him privately either, although he attended          and took some part in our more formal conversations, ince        17.  Prince Sapieha is so well known to the British Cabinet aeha.     that it is. unnecessary .to say. much of him.   He frankly admits          that he was completely gulled about the Kieff advance and told          me that the man who misled him was the present Chief of the          Polish Staff..  Ho more than once expressed regret at the line          he had taken when, in company with his predecessor, M,Patek*&apos;          he discussed the question with the Prime Minister, (Mr.Lloyd          George).  He was in every way helpful, and his statements to us          were always  sober and reasonable.   His policy is to try and          get an armistice and.a peace  if he possibly -
 can and  to.make-sacrifices for it. but in the last resort he will-fight, to  the. end.-.18&apos;., The-Minister  we all  liked best,was M.Grabski, the Minis- ter of Finance,, and late.Prime, Minister.  Though lacking strength,  he is  a  man of  transparent honesty and sincerity, a genuine  patriot.who on  every occasion  said  that he would fight to-.the last and  if necessary undertake a  partisan warfare Jffc- ther than  submit to the. Bolshevists..  At  the same time he was perfectly  reasonable about the necessity  for making  peace and making sacrifices to  get it. 19., M.  Skulski, a former.Prime Minister, did not appear to speak any  language other  than  Polish and  we did not  get Into close touch with him. 26,. General So3nokowski, Vice Minister for War, is  one of the figures to be reckoned with.   Lord D!Abernon did not form a  very good opinion of  him, but I  found him extremely business like and well  up in his facts.  General Weygand also has found him  most useful.  He is  a man of early middle  age, smart and  soldierly, in  appearance,  and one  of  Pilsudskif.s friends. 21.  The Chief of the Polish General Staff, is General Rozov- adosski.  General Radcliffe informed me  that General Wey^and, who is working with him,  finds him almost impossible.  His military dispositions during  the  critical period of  my  stay in Warsaw  fcerJranhly did not  inspire  confidence.  He  is a great optimist and  professes  to be  a profound  believer in  the of- fensive  which  is exactly  what  is  required at  present.   I am afiaid,  though,  that.he lacks  all precision and methrd.  Like all Poles  he  is a dreadful  procrastinator,  For  example, it , was agreed,  during our  stay,  between General Weygand and Mar- shal  Piludski  that General  Joseph Haller should  be given  the command  of the northern group of  armies.   Some 24  hours  later General  Weygand met  the Qoneral and asked why  he had not taken&apos; up his  command.  He replied that  he had  received no  orders.
It was not until General Weygand had sat down with the &apos;Ch e ........of the Staff and insisted on his writing the appointmentthat General Haller received it.  Meanwhile, at the most-critical fical period cf the thrust on Warsaw the command had remainedpractically vacant, as the superseded General w as ill withdysentry.  It struck me as extraordinary that * in thesecritical times, General Rozovadosski could spend two hours ata dinner at the Club, as he actually did;22.  In connection with the military coiiiratrnd xt is necessaryto mention General Henrys, the Head of the French military mission.  He is  a man of considerable personal charm, butmade the worst impression on our Mission as regards his military  qualities.  His appreciation of the military situa-tion on the day cf our arrival at Warsaw was the worst thatI have every heard from a French General.  He is a great friend of Marshal Pilr-udski and entered into a vehement defence of theMarshal&apos;s policy and strategy,-  In  spite of his friendship, he -has not the slightest influence over Marshal Pilsudski by Wiomhe se^ms to be hypnotised.  It Is undoubtedly due partly tohis failure to impress his personality that the French Missionhas not been made proper use of.  The.combination of thisgarrulous, inept French General, with the vain, intriguingHead of the State, is largely responsible for the complete breakdown of the Higher Command of  Poland, which is  the ul-legitimate cause of the  collapse of the Army,   The British Missionwere unanimously of  opinion that General Henrys should retireto Limoges, and Lord D!Abernon  sent a telegram home  to this effect.   General Weygand; who is the  loyalest of men,  stoodby his compatriot  and insisted  that he had  good military  qual-ities; and M,Jusserand  could not bring himself  to overridehis General.   Consequently, he  did  not  support  Lord  D^berno^splea, and Up to the  present  General Henrys  remains,  though  Ido not think he^ls^inter faring  with General Weygand.

A factor of decisive importancoin the affairs of Poland, OP NA-ALITY.  which I think is little understood at home, except by close        students of Polish affairs, is the remarkable influence of the        three nationalities which compose the Polish race..        25.  The Russian Poles, inhabiting what is Known  as Congress        Poland, that is to  say Poland of the Congress of Vienna, num-        ber some 12 million persons.. They were oppressed by  the Rus-        russians, and except to a limited extent in the Army, were not al-        lowed to take much part in Government Service. Economically,.        the Russians tried to keep them down, but not with&apos;, entire suc-        cess.  The mass of the people in this section of  Poland are il-        literate.        2o*.  The Poles of Posen are by universal admission b; Poles of        every sort and kind the sturdiest people and  the  best fighting        race.  They number approximately 3 million  persons.   They were        allowed  to  develop economically by  the  Germans, but not to  rise -        to the higher  ranks in  the Army or  in the Government  Services..        They are the most anti-German of all the  Poles.        27.  Finally,  there are  the  Austrian Poles,  numbering 3 million        in West  Galicia,  and  perhaps  2-\ to  3 million in  East  Galicia.        They were  petted  and  pp^Jgred by the Austrians and were allow-        ed to roach  high  positions both in  the  Armyhand  in the  Govern-        ment Services- -        28.  The best  authorities ascribe  to  these  considerations many        of the  present weaknesses of Poland...  It  is mainly from Austrian        Poland  that the Poles-have had  to  draw their officers and their        officials.  Their,lotficers have the faults.and the weaknesses        and  the tradition of defeat  of  the  Austrian Army.

They live          entirely, in the towns and form a&apos;considerable percentage of          the population of - every town and village.   At Warsaw there          are 300,000 Jews out ,of a/total&apos; population of 900,000.  They          wear a special garb and live in conditions of gijgat over-          crowding and squalor.  They, certainly present a most disagree-          able appearance.  Some years-&quot; ago the Russians expelled a grisat          part of the Jews from Russia and they took up their residence          in Poland, and the Poles feel strongly this intrusion.  There          was some slight tendency towards a patriotic movement amongst          the Jews during our stay, and sOme of them were enlisting.          The attitude of; the - Polish patrols&quot;, which  I saw searching the          Jewish Quarter, for&apos; deserters and&apos; men avoiding military service          was very hectaring and not pleasant&apos;to&apos; see.  There is no          doubt that thereis. much disaffection &quot;amongst the Jews against          the Poles .  A British Naval: Officer was in Byelostok just  ;          after the evacuation by the Poles and an hour or two before          the entry of the Russians,  Although the whole of the Polish              &quot; &apos;-    &apos;              &apos;  &apos;       &apos;  &apos;            &apos;            &quot;:;    I          civil,-population.had gone, crowds of  Jews  had remained and we; &apos; ;;j          standing about in the streets with their hands in their pocke&apos;   J          waiting for ,  the Bolshevists,      asked them for some hot wat^ I        .  to make some tea,  and they refused in a truculent manner.  Thv  1          Poles believed that Bolshevism exists in the Jewish quarters   if,          in Moscow and- the possibility of&apos;&amp; progrom preceding a ftussier          capture of Warsaw cannot be absolutely  excluded..          30.  Nothing has.yet been ddne by the Polish Diet to give          effect  to the Minorities Treaties.  On saying goodbye I im-          preased on Prince-Sapieha the importance,  from the point of                                                             view of                                      -18-
         public opinion in Western Europe and America of &quot;treating--the--         Jews property and avoiding trouble with them.is GENERAL 31.  Up to the last  day of my visit to Warsaw there was noITUDETHE      change in the general a attitude of the population of Warsaw.,PULATIOW.                         &quot;         which remained to all  app. arance perfectly normal..  The arist-         ocratic classes whom one met at the Club were.,  it is t*je,         deeply depressed and highly pessimistic, and not unnaturally         as,  day by day, they were seeing their properties devoured         by the advancing Bolshevists.  There was, however, none of         that anxiety observable in the faces of the general populace         vrhich one noticed in England or France during the darker days         of the war,  Some people ascribe this to the habit.of the Pol-         ish  people to shut their eyes to unpleasant facts; others to         ignorance; and yet others to the fact that Warsaw has be^a         occupied so often by Germans, and Russians, that a Bol^-xi-         vist occupation is not much dreaded.  There were always ru-         mours of a possible  Bolshevist rising in Warsaw itself, but a         Eritish officer who  is in Warsaw to advise on the organisa-         tion of the Police,  while admitting that a Communist Party         existed, did not  seem  very apprehensive, and thought that the         Police would be able to keep the movement in hand.  During         my  stay there was a  genuine patriotic movement  in Warsaw.  It         reminded one a little  of the days when  the Kitchener Army was         of  processof formation.  Officers were  addressing  the crowds         from motor-cars.  In one place a  sort of pulpit had been  er-         ected  in the street  from which a bugle  sounded  at  Intervals;         and both men and  women addressed  open air meetings  in search         of  recruits.  There  were  Proclamations  all  over the  town.         Late one night a  number of men were  seenv etiring  before  a         party of  shrieking women who were  calling  out  to  them  &quot;Go   o          the front.&quot;  It  seems  there  are  Polish  &quot;Cuthberts&quot;,   There         were Polish  women dressed  like W.A.A.C&apos;s,  and I was  informed          that  a battalion of them  had  attacked  the  Bolshevists  at          Grodno, but  I  cannot vouch for  this,.  The  volunteers marched                                          ^19-,
about the streets singing national songs in a stentorianunison, but 1 was told that this was done by order and notspontaneously.  Trains leaving the city were not  excessivelycrowded and there was not the smallest sign of panic   Theonly part of the population that seemed nervous was the Jews, .and, walking one day past the American Consulate  I found thewhole street crowded with jews seeking for passports.   TheOberburgermeister of Danzig told me that the town was  fillingup with Jewish refugees from Poland.  They probably fear a polish pogrom more than the arrival of the Bolshevists.  one reason for leaving Poland, however, is probably the desireto avoid military service.32.  The spirit of the prople as a whole is willing enough  andno one could remain long in Warsaw and doubt that a ferventpatriotic spirit, exists among a great part of them. As a nation, however, they are like children, utterly  unpracticaland improvident, and it is to be feared that they have putoff until too late their efforts at national unity and war rgani satisfaction on.33.  polish Ministers and a number of young officers who hadbeen for some time in the country expressed the view that whenthe Bolshevists appeared outside of Warsaw the whole popula-tion, man woman and child would sally forth with  scythes,pokers, or any weapon they could find and give them a  drub-bing.  There is probably some precedent for this  in thePolish history (probably the peasants revolt of 1863),  forin the toyshops I noticed toy soldiers armed with scythes.Within the last few days peasants have actually arrived atWarsaw with their scythes to enlist and have been seen byBritish officers.  There is said to have been a precedent within&apos;the last year or two at Lemberg where the whole population                    -I -sallied out and drove, off the Ruthenians.  Some temporary success                     \might conceivably be achieved at terrific 10S3 by such a spon-                                                             Vtaneous effort on the part of the population, but from a serios
military point of view it must be calculated thalr^basis-^3-arr\armistice is signed in a few days, or afew weeks at the out-side, Warsaw will fall.34.  Horrible stories are &apos;current about Bolshevist atrocities.Some of them are parobably true, as- they are supported by goodevidence.  I saw some of the most revolting photographs whichit has ever been my misfortune to see, involving a, combination of bestiality, cruelty, and sodd^sm,  such as one could nothave conceived possible.  The scale of the photographs almostprecluded a &quot;fake&quot;&apos;.  Unfortunately, these horrors,  which are probably exceptional, are generally believed to.be generalamong the Bolshevists and have probably, been a contributorycause to the demoralisation of the army.  The Bolshevistswould soon crush any outbreak of partisan warfare by resort to atrocities and torture on a scale which would stagger eventhe hardened&apos; world of to-day.35.  UP to    -itfay I left, the Polish Cabinet had. not consideredthe question of where the capital would be.&apos;established if Warsawwere evacuated.  Price Sapieha&apos; told me that the government werenot considering the matter at all.  One of the; defects of thepolish&apos; character is that they will not look,facts in the face.Everyone would say &quot;Some how I: don&apos;t believe the,.Bolshevists willever get to warsawt.&quot;  it is only fair to add, however, that theGovernment feared any discussion would leak out.and cause apanic.              &apos;&quot;36.  owing to the strength&apos; of the&apos;Austrian influences thosefew Ministers who were willing to&apos; discuss the question seemedto prefer cracow as the place  to which the Government wouldretire, though I am assured that at Cracow there is littleaccommodation.  The view of the Anglo-French Mission was  thatposen would be betteri  It has easier access to Danzig and atpozen the Government would be based on the moat sturdy andvirile element in the population.                    3  &apos;-----------
                        PART  IV.                    THE MILITARY SITUATION.  -* 37.  According to figures given me by the British Military  Mission, the approximate strength of the forces engaged are                                          4  as follows  :-                                 Polish        Bolshevist                               combatants      combatants  Northern pront       ....     3 5,000          115,950  Southern Front,      ....     30,000           49,950      The above figures are derived from Polish sources,  and  General Radcliffe, after visiting the front,  considered  that as regards the polish army they might be divided by  three.  The Bolshevist figures are very approximate only,  but the polish intelligence Department is said to have proved  fairly accurate.  &apos;&apos;      As regards reserves, polish sources state  that on the-  Northern front there is one Polish infantry division and one  infantry brigade in close reserve,  on the Southern front  there is one polish infantry division, one cavalry division, ,  and one cavalry brigade in- reserve.  Of the above only Tihe  .  cavalry formation is fresh,, the infantry being exhausted.  Strength 10*000 bayonets, 9,000 sabres.      As regards the Bolshevists, there are believed to be  already en  route 4 infantry divisions, 1 cavalry corps, and  2 cavalry divisions,  estimated strength 20,000 rifles and  12,000 sabres.  Other available reserves are;- troops from.  the 7th Army (Fsthonian and Lettish fronts) 15,000 rifles,  petrograd garrison 8,000 rifles and sabres; 18th Army (pos-  sibly already en route) 13,000 rifles; 10th and 13th Army  (Caucasus) 28,400 rifles and the eight labour, armies.  38.  The present deplorable military-situation of the Polish  Army is the &apos;direct result of the -grandiose and ill-conceived.  ad van c e on Ki ef f:.  At first the Bol she vis t g we re taken, by  surprise and the advance was a great success, large captures  being made.  As the troops advanced, however, they
became extended over a front far too great for an army of22 divisions.  The Bolshevist ^assembled forces from otherparts of Russia, and shortly after the capture- of Kieff,Budennie&apos;Ts cavalry broke through the thinly held Polishlines, if, indeedj lines they could be called.  Descendingupon the comnunications of the Polish Army, he Caused theevacuation of Kieff,  though many military authorities in poland maintain that Kieff ought to have been.held.  Thatwas the view of the officer commanding that section of thepolish line.  Budennie, it is maintained,  would soon havehad to retire for further supplies, etc. and his retreat mighte-gen have been intercepted.  However this may be,  Kieff wasin fact evacuated, and from that day to this the retreathas never ceased.  The small polish reserve divisions wererapidly absorbed into the vastly extended line,  and graduallythe retreat has become more aiid more disorganised,  untilnow it is little better than a rout.39.  I did not visit the front myself but General  Radcliffedid and nearly every day during my sta^ at Warsaw I sawBritish or prench officers immediately back from the front.All tell exactly the same story.  The Polish troops are spreadso thinly that they do not hold a connected front  at all.  Itis possible to travel for miles along the so-called linemarked on the staff maps of the moment, without meeting anyformed units at all.   The Bolshevist cavalry,  which is by far the most efficient section of the Bolshevist Army,  and isled by Officers of the old regime,  time after time  get round the flanks of the Polish forces, and manoeuvre them intoretreat.   There has not been a 3ingle real battle  of any considerable size.throughout the whole retreat,  and the linesare often separated by 10 or 2$ kilometres,  just  before ourarrival in Warsaw, /for example,  it was announced that Grodnohad been evacuated! by the poles.  The General at the Head ofthe Italian Military Mission on that day drove through
Grodno and several kilometres beyond without finding asingle Bolshevist.  He told me that Grodno was still de-fended by splendid trenches and barbed-wire which theGermans had put down, the whole system being in splendidorder and only requiring barbed-wire to be put across theroads.  The polish General, however, would not hold itbecause he was afraid of being out-flanked.  When they domeet the enemy the polish troops seem to fight quite well,and one of our officers described a magnificent bayonet chargeby a posnanian Regiment against some Bolshevist infantrywhich he had witnessed, and in which the Polish troops hadbeen completely victorious.  The men,  however, are desper-ately tired,  some British $aval officers who had been to thefront on the day before I left Warsaw told me that they metcavalry units all asleep on their horses and they only wokeup at the sound of the motor horn.  Infantry, whom they metdeployed to hold certain positions, were all asleep likedead men on the ground.  The units they met were mostterribly reduced,  a regiment with a nominal, strength of 2,000men having only 200 men commanded by a subaltern.  Allaccounts bear out this, that,  at the present moment all units are down to a very small proportion of their nominal strength.My naval friends met a brigade of artillery; they asked why it had not come into action, and the reply was that the infantry in front were so few that, were they to unlimber,they would inevitably be captured.4o. Where are all the men gone?  They certainly are notkilled because the fighting has not been heavy enough forthat.  Not many of them, I think, are wopuded.  I only sawone wounded man during my whole stay at Warsaw, and myprivate secretary,/who was living at the station, only sawabout half-a-dozen.  The officers who came down from thefront all reported \that during the v/hole day they would onlysee one or two walking wounded.  A good many of the wounds
  are reported to be self-inflicted.. All reports agree, however,  that . there-are great numbers of stragglers. .  The so attach- ^themselves more especially to the supply columns whioh are said  by eye-witnesses to be accompanied by excessive numbers of men  compared with the numbers at the front.  Undoubtedly great  numbers of men have lost their units..-   My Naval friend and  General Radcliffe both questioned many men arid found they were  looking for their units and in some casos&quot;had been doing so  for a fortnight.  On one occasion my Naval friend was able  to direct two troopers to where fighting was going on,  and  they a&amp; onca galloped off to try to attach, thomsolvos to some  unit.,   While many of the men are mere stragglers,  there are.,  nevertheless, m-ny deserters..   A big round-up was being carried  out in Warsaw during our stay.    The Polish  authorities would  not state how many had been taken;  but  admitted that they -  amounted to several thousand.   All  over the  City and especially  in the  Jewish quarter,, one met the  patrols examining men&apos;s papers  and considerable bodies of men wore being marched through the  streets under escort.-   This action,  though  much delayed,  was  being carried out  thoroughly..   My  Private Secretary,  for example,  was stopped three  times for examination of his papers.   A  French General told M.- Jusserand that more than 50,000  men  had been rounded up and were in various concentration camps  in process  of being sorted out.   Quite 25,000 of these were  regarded as effective  soldiers.   On the day  I  left the  number  was stated  to be 100,000.  41.   General Radcliffo could  find  no&quot;trace  of any measures  being taken on the  roads  or in  tho  towns and villages  between  Warsaw  and  the  front  to direct men  to their  units,, and  it is  clear that  the Provost-Marshal Service  of the-  Polish forces,  like every  part  of  the  High Organisation,  i&apos;s defective,  43,   All accounts  agree  that  the regimental officers are  very                     \ .  -  .    &quot;  . :.                             -25-

General Yfeygand            said he belie ve d that so ine., w ri tte n&apos;  orders he  dr aft e d&apos; we re            the first that had ever been Issued by  the.. Polish. General            Staff..   Until the time of our  arrival  hardly any use  had been            made of the French Military Mission,  although it comprised            nearly 600 officers, including  many of  very  high-technical            attainments..   This was largely, due to  the vanity, of the.            Polish character.   One of the  first  acts of Lord D.1 Abernon            and M.Juseerand on&apos; their arrival  was  to- insist: on proper use            being made of General, ^eygand  and the French Military Mission.            General Weygand (a most loyal  man who would  not do  anything  to            weaken the position of -General  Henrys)  was with the utmost  .            difficulty induced to accent an..invitation from the Polisn.  ,            Government and the Anglo-jbrench Mission to.act as adviser &apos;*            to the Polish Chief of the General  Staff  during his stay in            Warsaw, the duration of which  is&apos;  uncertain.  5
In addition, the Polish Government were induced to attachFren&amp;h Officers to the Higher Commands of Army Groups, Arm-ies, and Divisions.  On the day of my departure, IU Jusser-and told me that he was not entirely satisfied but that much &apos;had been done, and he was hopeful of good results.  In oneinstance a French Commander, namely, General Spier, has beenappointed as Commander of an Army, namely, the First Army,on the left wing, that is to say the critical wing, of thePolish Army.  M.  Grabski, at my final interview informed me that the Council of Ministers had that morning decidedthat the Chief of the General Staff must follow General&quot;?/eygand&apos;s advice in all matters, but he admitted that pro-fessional jealousy on the part of Polish officers might mil-itate against full use being made of French advice.44.  There is no doubt that political influences work badresults in the direction of the military campaign.  When theMission arrived in Warsaw what puzzled us most was that whileGrodno had fallen and the First Army which was covering War-Haw was by all accounts dispersed and scattered and no re-serves for It existed, all available troops were neverthelessbeing sent to the Southern theatre.  Some little time elapsedbefore we discovered the real reason.  This I believe isthat under the Gr&amp;bski Agreement it was provided that thearmistice line should be drawn at the point the armies had reached when the fighting stopped.  In order to secure afavourable line in $astern Galicia and thus to exert  someinfluence over the peace settlement in that theatre,  everyeffort was being made to save&apos;the situation in Eastern Gal-ioia, and to cover Lemberg and the oilwells, where,&apos; It maybe remarked in passing, the French have bought up almost the whole of the shares.  It was proferred to take risks andto uncover Warsaw in a theatre where&apos; under-the Spa arrange-ments, the enemy woiild have to rsMrs CO- kilometres beyondGrodno rather than to uncover Eastern Calicia. . The influence
  I    of the Austrian-Poles  is to be obearrved there.  The day before       my departure  I visited a training ground  just outside Warsaw,       and  one  of the officers told us that  if we had been there two       days, before we should  have seen a cavalry regiment at exercise.       Lord D&apos;Abernon asked where it had gone, and the reply was       &quot;To  the  Southern&apos;theatre&quot;.  This was  after the capture of      .Byelostok. -       45.  Before I left, General Weygand was at work, with the    -..  Polish Chief of the Staff, on the elaboration of a plan for       the  protection of Warsaw, and for the concentration of a re-       serve to the shattered first and fourth armies.  This was       considered better than any attempt to dribble men or units       into the broken armies themselves,  A small farce had already       been collected, and, by withdrawing men from the southern       front and reconstituting some of the  shattered divisions, it  ,     was hoped in time to make up a new force.  The doubtful ques-       tion was whether sufficient time would be available.  The       Bolshevists were only  85 miles from Warsaw and had advanced       80 miles in the five da&apos;ys we were there,SO SALS  46...  Some of the Polish Ministers pressed strongly for the LIB AL- TBOOPc despatch of allied troops.  They urged  the usual argument       that even a small force would produce a tremendous moral       effect, though most of them, when pressed, wanted not less       than B divisions.  Another argument used  was that, unless       allied troops were sent, the Government could not induce      the Polish people to accept&apos;the handing over of the Command       to Allied officers.  Marshal Pilsudski himself wanted a few       small detachments which &apos; ould be spread through the armies       in order to show the troops that allied soldiers were fight-       ing  with them.  To the suggestion that the appearance of the       French officers would  be sufficient ocular demonstration of       this, they replied that the soldiers would attach much more                        &quot;... \       importance to men of\their own class  than to officers.
        The Polish Ministers, however,, were not unreasonable when        the impossibility of providing troops was pointed out to them. ,        47.  Another proposal in the same order which was made by        the Polish Ministers was that they should be allowed te        recruit volunteers in allied! countries. . Prince Sapieha        stated that they liad had many offers of such volunteers        from Europe and America.  We did not refuse the prfpteal in        principle but pointed out that it would be difficult to form        unite of volunteers in the allied countriee, and that it        would be beet to form the units in poland itself.  One dif-        floulty raised against the proposal was that the volunteers        would require a much higher standard of feeding and pay than        the Polish soldiers,  tiy own opinion is that the Polish        Government might he encouraged to enliet teohnic.il troops.        such as aviators and men for 2anks,.heavy artillery, &amp;c.,        but that any help of this kind should be limited to this.        I was informed that some American volunteer aviators had        done admirable service on the Southern front.I0POSED  48.  One of the methods which at first.commended itself to10$     the Mission for remedying the military situation was the des-&apos;rlCEBS  patch of British officers,  not only as Sljaff Officers,  but        also as regimental officers for.the  command of battalitns and        even cf companies.  Before reaching Poland a telegram was        despatched to London suggesting that suitable officers up        to the number of 200 should be selected, but that no action        for their despatch should be taken until the receipt of ad-        vice from Warsaw,  All the members of the Uiesion after        having grasped the situation in Warsaw felt doubts as to the        expediency of adopting this suggestion at the present time.        Personally,  I should be strongly opposed to it.          - The        Higher Command of the Polish Army is so weak; it is so doubt-        ful whether the Command and advice.of the French Officers will        be accepted; the poles are so vain,  wilful, intriguing and        difficult to work with,  that I would,not taice the responsibility
        Of  recommending that British officers&apos; lives should be        risked in the resulting welter of confusion.  M. Grabski,        whom, on my departure, I asked to say frankly whether he        wanted British officers, replied that they would be of the        utmost value.  Marshal Pilsudski raised every possible dif.        ficulty, more.especially that of language, and obviously did        not want them.  Other Ministers did not seem  enthusiastic.      -  On saying goodbye I asked M. Jusserand to give me his opin-       ; ion quite frankly.  He said that at first he had been in fa-*        vour of the proposal, but that, having seen the difficulties        encountered by French officers in making their influence        felt with the Poles, he would reply frankly that he thought        to introduce  a third nation would merely create an additional        complication  and enable the Poles to  play off one nation        against another.  I would strongly recommend delay and the        utmost cau  ion in taking this step. MATERIAL. 49.  The  question of war material required for the  Polish        Army was discussed in detail with the Polish War Office by        General Radcliffe. and General  -&apos;:eygand, and  General Radcliffe        has  forwarded the more urgent demands to the War Office who        are  to arrange with  the French War Office as to meeting        them.  Boots  are most urgently required, and I  observed num^        bers of  soldiers walking about and even marching through        the  streets bare-footed.   The  list of defects  is a very        long one  and  includes 93,000 rifles,  108000 carbines, 300,000        uniforms,  100,000 helmets,  165,000 million  rounds  of  small        arms ammunition,  4,000  machine-guns,  400  Lewis gunsv &amp;ir&quot;         orwftv. apd almost  every conceivable  kind  of military  equip-        ment,-FiOWER.   50.  , The man-power  of Poland  appears  ample  for the present         needs.-  I was informed  by  the commercial  attsche,  Mr, Kimens        - a man with a  long-experience  of Poland,  who speaks Polish     &apos; &apos;               / - &quot; -     i i     &apos;  &apos;         that during the Great.i^ar  the Man-power  of  Poland  had hardly                   &apos;- -,  \     -      &apos;&apos;        -        ,  &apos;.        been touched.

She Internal  communications of the Polish Army do not appear    to be unsatisfactory.  .There is at. Warsaw a British Railway Mission    forming part  of.the Economic&apos; (transport) Section of the Supreme -  Economic Council. &apos; Colonel Graham, the Officer in charge, informed me    that the railway position was not at all bad.  During the idvanco to,                                  Kieff it was oJ   It               ;  &apos;  &apos;                    : i           21.
          severely strained-, but  the  reduction  of the lines of com-.^          munication &quot;by  some 200  miles, have made the position much          easier.   But little  rolling-stock was lost in the retreat.          Since  then also  a number  of American  locomotives have been          received.   West of  Grodno  the  line is normal gauge and the          Russians have  but little  normal gauge rolling stock, so          that the Bolshevist  railway position  is greatly inferior to          that of the Poles.   Every mile  that the retreat Continues          makes  the railway position  easier for the Poles and harder          for the Bolshevists,  With  the  fall of Warsaw the Poles          will lose some valuable railway shops but thore are some          good shops at  Posen  and work  is done  for the Polos at Danzig,          so  that, taking  into consideration the surplus of rolling-          stock  with the shortened  lines  of communication, the pos-          ition should not be  difficulto              A contingency which  cannot be overlooked is that if the         &apos; Bolshevists capture  Warsaw  they will  aim at cutting off the          communications of Poland  with Danzigi -  This may bring them          into the &quot;corridor&quot;. What  the  effect of that on the Germane...-.          who of course  intend eventually to recover the &quot;corridor&quot;          will be it is  impossible  to forecast.               The Poles have  not a very  largo  number of motor-lorries,          and for their  transport use mainly the light country carts          of which enormous numbers are available.   There are ample          draught horses.   Generally,  therefore, the transport position          of the Poles  civos no cause for anxiety.               The Bolshevists, who live  to  a  great  extent  on the          country, which is at present  well&apos;supplied,&quot;with  the harvest          just in and plenty  of cattle  and horses, are also  sufficiently          supplied with  country cartsB EXTBRML   53.   One of  the most  disquieting features  of  tho wholeMpiCATIONS              VTHSJ PQLISS  military situation in Poland  is  the precarious  natureX,                       f          of its communications as  regards the  transport  of war mater-          ial with tho  outside world,  fundamentally this  is due  to  the          fact that Poland is  hated by all its  neighbours.   Germany                                     -38-
                                                         &apos;    HInot only hates but despises the Poles.  The Gzeoho-Slovaks,though in principle they do not wish Poland to collapse and bring the Bolshevists to thoir boundary, regard the Poleswith the greatest distrust, as Imperialists,  and as a dis-grace to- the cause of timall Nations.  The Teschen controver-sy has intensified the mutual dislike of the  Poles andCzecho-Slovakians.  The Roumanians are, on the whole, the neighbouring nation that dislikes the Poles the least, andthat is one of the reasons why the Poles are  so anxiousto obtain Eastern Galicia, namely,, so as to maintain abo in:clary with Boumania,54.  Too advance of the Bolshevists, instead of bringingsympathy to Poland from their neighbours, has stiffened theirbacks, with the result that they are all refusing to allowwar material to be transported to Poland through their territory..  During our stay we learned first  of Dr, SimonTsdeclaration of neutrality involving refusal of the passageof war material, and later that trains from France,, con-taining munitions, which had.up till then been allowed.to, pass through Germany to Poland under a special conventionbetween Poland and Germany, were being held up, and actually .looted.  General Bingham and General Malcolm, who were sum-mened to a conference from Berlin, both expressed the viewthat Germany would not permit the passage of war material.They also gave their strong opinion that Germany would.not permit the diversion to Poland of German war material whichhas to be destroyed under the terms of the Treaty of Ver- sailles..  hven if the Government allowed it, labour would hold it up everywhere   on railways,&apos; canals, and in docks.Osecho-blovakia has always been reluctant to  allow warmaterial to pass,  and imposes every sort of obstacle.  Prof-essor Lasaryit showed no^ inclination&apos;to depart from this at-attitude, and. made a very strong and definite statement to the two Missions that\his policy -was one of&apos;non-intervention.
The Polish Government have tried to get munitions from Italythrough Hungary and Roumania, but the Labour boycott of hungary has resulted in these being held up in Austria.  TheAllied Military Mission of Control have refused to permit the exportation of munitions ordered in Austria under the Treatyof St. Germain.  The Council of Ambassadors, which canauthorise the export of these munitions is not in session.The two Missions agreed with the Polish Government that thematter should be raised at the next meeting of the supreme council.55.  There remains only the route through Danzig, where thePoles are hated as aordially as everywhere else.  They have only themselves to thank for this.   They have assumed a veryoverbearing attitude towards the Danzigers,  $hey constantlyshoot at Danzig fishing boats which in beating landward passwithin Polish territorial waters north of Danzig.  not long ago they killed a fisherman in this way.  They have irritatedthe Danzigers in a number of minor ways which it is un-necessary to mention.  The result is that the Danzigers, whoare strongly German at heart, and who are watching events in poland with acute attention, have taken advantage of thePolish reverses to refuse to unload munitions...56.  On the day of our arrival we found the Polish Ministry tothe last degree depressed about the state of their eommunica-tions.  Every avenue was closed to them.  They felt completelyisolated from all prospect of material support and this had produced a most serious effect on the morale of the Government,the Army, and the nation.  General Having, Commanding  theBritish Troops at Danzig, had been summoned to meet us atYiarsaw.  He reported that there was no immediate prospect ofinduaing the German stevedores to work.  He and all other persons who knew Danzig strongly deprecated any attempt touse Polish labour, which would only produce most seriousdisturbances in the port and city.  The need for arms  was
critical, vital, and urgent.  The Bolshevist Army was advancingradidly  from Grodno towards warsaw. There were no reserves tomeet  the attack, and the only way in which such reserves could he constituted was by arming the volunteer, forces, which included a certain number of- men who, had served as. soldiers,and using them to re-constitute some of the shattered divisions of the polish Army.  The only solution that General Hakingcould offer, Or which anyone could  suggest, was to permit the use  of British soldiers to unload the Butch ship Ji Triton&quot;then in  Danzig with arms and munitions from salonica-.  Withthe full concurrence of General Radcliffe and myself, lord&apos;Abernon decided that he must act on his own responsibility in the matter,  communications with London are a low,  and communications between London and Danzig are no quicker.  Daysmust be  lost if the instructions were sent through London.,  anddays could not be spared if the material force was to be pro-vided and if the moral vigour were  to be Instilled in theGovernment,  In &quot;the Army, and .in the people, without whichWarsaw could not possible be saved.  Lord D*Abernon thereforegave General Haking authority to use the British troops, and sent him back  at-haste to Danzig. . He wrote to. sir ReginaldTo^cr telling him of the vital urgency of the - situation and asking for his co-operation, and notified the Foreign Office.57.  The effect of Lord D^Abemot^s action was almost magical.&quot;Within 48 hours we learned that the first barge load ofmunitions had passed from Danzig to Dirschau,: well on their way to Poland,  it is impossible to over-estimate the effectthat this has on the mercurial spirits of the Polish Ministers.Thia one act probably did more to restore their morale than anything else that the-Mission was able to dp..  Admittedly,Lord D^Abernon was taking a serious responsibility., , it was difficult in Poland to judge the effect on the soldiers them-selves,   on the Danzig Labour, anci on British Labour.  General                        35.
Haking, however, had given-us- assurances in regard to thesoldiers and had stated that the Danzig labour Leaders had agreedto the plan.  The favourable reception of Mr. Lloyd George1sspeech by the Labour Leaders on the 21st July,  1920,  encouragedus to hope that British Labour would accept the situation.58.  Nevertheless, we all felt that Danzig was still a veryweak poiin&amp;fln our position,  and Lord D1Aberr.on agreed that Ishould visit the Port and examine the situation on the spot on my way home.59.  I visited Danzig on Satu-r&amp;ry,&apos; Xily 31st, and spent thewhole day there, consulting with Sir Reginald Tower,  ColonelStrutt, General Haking and Captain pitzMaurice, R.N,  I visited the &quot;Triton&quot;, and found the soldiers working cheerfully andwrillingly under their own officers.  There had-been no inter-ference from the Danzig Labour men, and some of their Leadershad been invited on board to see the work.  The winches werebeing worked by members of the crew, only about 50 oi 60soldiers in all were employed at one time, there being tworeliefs, so that only from 100 to 120 men in all were involved.The Dutch First Officer informed me that, after the first dartor two, the soldiers had worked the cargo more rapidly than thelocal  stevedores.  There had only been one case on the partof the soldiers of refusing duty, and that case had been,dealtwith by a minor punishment and the contagion had not spread.60* - Nevertheless, as I have reported to Lord D&apos;Abernon, i cannot conceal  that the present arrangement is a mere stop-gap,  it was hoped that the sight of the  soldiers working the cargo and earning the pay would act as an inducement tothe Danzig Labour men to take on the work theirs elves.  ttegotia-tions were still in progress when I left Danzig, but  theresult was  very uncertain. - General Haking informed me that hecould not undertake to unload a  second ship, and two more ships with most important munitions&apos; are expected at  Danzig.&apos; some means must  therefore be found for dealing with the situation.                    )  . ;  - -                    &apos;   i&apos; :                           3 6... v
For  reasons already fully explained, the Poles cannot beintroduced; and  the Danzigers will not do the work.  the objection  to Poles was emphasised on the day preceding&quot; myarrival by the fact that a small, emeute  which had begun as a protest against high prices and taxation, had, in the end,developed  into a poie*hunt.61.  After -discussing the matter very fully with all the men othe  spot I have come to the conclusion that the only way tomeet the situation and maintain the communications of Polandwith the outside world, - is. for the British Government to beprepared to take-over the. port of. Danzig.  It- would involveundertaking the full control of the Port, the inland waterwayswithin the port and between the Port and the Vistula&quot;, atleast part of the Docks,  and the railways between that partof the Docks and the Polish boundary.  It Would also involvethe maintenance of such allied forces as were necessary tomaintain order.  It might also involve the despatch of LabourBattalions, unless Polish Labour were employed umder Britishprotection, but this Would necessitate a larger garrison.The words  &quot;the British Government should be prepared to takebver&quot; have been used deliberately.  It is possible that axiiere announcement in parliament that we were preparing to do this would bring the Danzig labourers to their senses,  andthat- they, would prefer themselves to handle the trafficrather than see their wages passing to other hands.  There  are12,000 unemployed, in the port and city of Danzig, and thiswill provide an additional - argument.  If&apos;the British Labourparty would co-operate by announcing its desire to support  theindependence of Poland,  the memories of the &quot;lolly Roger&quot;would tyt erased and Labour at Danzig would be.influenced.62.  It ia not desired, in any way to. under- rate -the magnitude of:-the- aperation whichfira-here, proposed.  It would be costlyand might involve., difficulties with Labour at home;, it-would
&quot;be-necessary to secure the assent of the supreme Counciland probably of the council of the League of Nations;   If,however, the British Government is sincerely desirous  ofmaking the  effort (admittedly with douboful prospects ofsuccess) to enable Poland to maintain its independence, itis absolutely vital that this line of communication  shouldbe kept open.  Moreover, it would be consistent  with the traditions of the great sea power if its principal assistanceto Poland took the&apos; form of maintaining the sea communications,including the sea port on which Poland depends for communica-tion with the outside world.  France, on the other hand,should be left a free hand in the direction of the land operations.38.
                     : A R T  V,             SOME COrOLUDi:^ OBSERVATIONS*64-.  Throughout this visit nothing interested me more than the remarks of Professor Masaryk, which appeared to me profoundand right.  In the long run Bolshevism must he met by its ownweapons.  A barrier of democracies is a greater safeguard thana barrier of military states.  If they are advanced democracieslike Czechoslovakia, the Bolshevists are less likely to quar-rel with them, than.with more chauvinistic.states like Poland,     &quot;;hether Poland is likely to establish such a Government itis difficult to judge.  Hitherto her internal administration doesnot seem to have been much wiser than her foreign policy, illus-trated by her failure to give effect to the Minorities Treaty.&quot;Another instance came to my notice at Danzig where just beforemy visit the head  of the Lutheran church, whose1 ecclesiasticaljurisdiction extends to the Polish corridor, had been to theHigh Commissioner to ask his advice as to bow he vas to meetthe intolerance shown by the Poles to the Lutherans of the corridor.  .Reverthless, there are some signs of wiser counselsprevailing,  %e influence of the extreme reactionaries of the .Dmowski type is diminishing.  The Diet has enacted a good dealof legislation of a very democratic character, including a-drastic finance bill imposing a heavy taxation and death duties.An Act has been passed Uniting the amount of land that any single individual can hold.  I was  informed that one of thefirst people to ask for a permit to hold land in excess ofthat allowed by the la&apos;- was E. - itos, the Peasant Prime Minister,which does n t sound encouraging] Land tenure by the peasants,combined with the strength of the Roman Catholic Church,should provide a good foundation for an anti-Bolshevist btate,provided the government^and the administration can show morewisdom than has been the case hitherto..  given granted this, how-ever, the continued existence of Poland between Germany on
the one hand and Russia on the other is very problematical.even it she survives the present crii-is.  The arrangement of&apos;Danzig and the corridor inspires no co- fidwnoe on the spot.  IhePoles detest it.  The Danzigers are Germans and to the Germansthe corridor is already a Germania irridenta.  In their heartsnot one of the British Officials who are trying to work it be-lieve in it.  The Germans and Danzigiers are  watching the situa-tion very closely, and will lose no opportunity to re-establishtheir position in the corridor.  If Poland falls down, thiswill be an a cut?; problem in a month or two.65.  v-hat British policy should be in  such an eventuality it isdifficult to say,  Even though the troubles of Poland are al-most entirely due to her o*m folly and neglect of our warnings,we are practically committed to do our best - to-secure her inde-pendence.  Unless the lever of trading relations proses suffi-ciently powerful, it is useless to shut our eyes to the factthat we shall probably fail,  soviet Russia already is onthe borders of East Prussia.  Before many months have elapsedher frontiers may march with those of  the whole of Eastern Germ--&apos;any.  At the moment all Germany stands at the parting of the      Inways. /Berlin on Sunday I met Mr. Dressel, the American Corn-mis sloner there, who told me he had spent the whole morning  withGeneral Ludendorff.  The latter said he would like to fightBolshevism, bu  added that he feared uie whole world was become-ing Bolshevist and that he was disposed to become one himself in order to be early in the movement.  Whether Ludendorff countsfor anything or not at the present time, his attitude illus-tratea the state of mind of the country.  Germany stands to  gaina good deal from an understanding with Russia, whether ijCj. in-volves a permanent adoption of the Soviet system, as the extrem-..ists desire, or a mere temporary and opportunist acceptance  of  -the s;&apos;&apos;rtem, which is probably In the minds of the reactlohar-ies.  By such an understanding, based  on the elimination- otv
-Polandy ^Germimynnight  expect  to secure her reteri^tiijai^o^TJpr^r^^ Silesia,  a;id the  recovery&quot;af ...the&quot;corridor-and Danzig,   In the Ukraine  there  are vast supplies of  wheat,  estimated by  the Brit-                        at ish  Commercial  Attache&apos; /Warsaw at 10  million tons,  stored in pear-shaped  cavities excavated in the fields as  in  the  past days,  I  have  seen wheat  stored in  Southern Europe * This great store  only needs  goods in  exchange  and railways  to  transport It-. The  German railways are rapidly, recover!  g,  as any  traveller-can see  for himsfe*f,  and c nsiderable quantities could  soon be made available to supplement the German  Harvest,   From Germany, her nearest neighbour,  Soviet  Russia can  obtain her  requirements In rail^-y material, agricultural implements,  and above all organising brains,. This Development  may  be Imminent,   presume- ably it was  not without reason that Dr. Simons stated last week that he   as  in  favour  of  trading relations  with  ivussia,  and  that Poland must  be  -a bridge and   not a barrier,   either are Herr Oscar  Conn,  Dr, Levi,  and  Herr Daumig  attending the Third International at  Moscow merely for  the good of their health, 66,  It is probably too late to use  Germany  as  a  Military bar- rier against Russia.-   It is true that Soviet Russia is  not real- ly a formidable military Power,  The  faces  they  employ  and their armaments are not formidable  as  compared  with those employed by the  Western  Powers during  the  late  ftar.. Germany, even with the armaments still remaining  undestroyed,  which however are rapddly diminishing, could easily  repulse any military attack by the Soviets,  and even after the destruction of  her armaments could easily be re-equipped  for  the  purpose,  if she  had the will,  But Germany has  no  longer  the  wish to fight,  and probably the Sov- ;iets are  not so foolish as to  attack  her. 67   &quot;hat, then;^ should be  the  policy  of the -fe stern Powers, If Poland collapses and Germany and Russia  come  together? Francefs  reply Would be &quot;The Occupation of  the Ruhr&quot;&apos; In order to deprive Germany of  the  district  fromwhich her armaments
would be derived.  &apos;i&quot;his would very likely result in split-ting off the Rhinelands and Bavaria from the German Reich, .and to leave Prance master of the Continent.   It issuggested that a more far-sighted policy would be torecognise that Poland has- by her own folly precipitated afate that could only have been avoided by the display ofgreat wisdom on her part;  while dwing what we can tosecure tolerable conditions for Poland to cultivate good relations with Germany?  and to use Germany as the bridgeby which in.the course of years British capital may beintroduced to Russia and normal relations may be restored.&quot;rre should trust for the moment to exhaustion and later tothe innate dislike between Germany and Russia,. and to the.gradual improvement of our relations with both parties toavoid a military alliance against us.   In the meanahile, assoon as our obligations of honour are fulfilled, we shouldpull out of all military responsibilities in Poland and leave Central and  astern Europe to work out its own fatewithout our intervention.   For our own future we should depend as in  the past mainly on our overseas connections.En route from Germanyto London.        August 5, 1920.
