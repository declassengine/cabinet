I circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues,  a note by the GeneralStaff on the present political and military situation in China.                                                                      &quot;W. S. &quot;C.  THE WAR OFFICE,       lUh August, 1920.     1. The existing disturbances in China compel consideration of our military situationin that country in the event of these disturbances assuming an anti-foreign complexion.     Our position in North China is that we maintain a small garrison* in order to carryout our  obligations  under the Treaty of 1901 to police a portion  of  the Pekin Shan-hai-kuan railway, and in order to provide a guard for our  Legation at Pekin anda detachment for Wei-hai-Wei.  The latter place at the moment is a British possession.Similar forces for the protection of the railway  and of  their respective Legations at &apos;Pekin are provided by other Powers.     In South China the position is somewhat different,  as we only occupy territory which is at present British.  This territory includes the very important commercial and naval port of Hong Kong,  which is lightly garrisonedt  for the  purpose  of  maintaininginternal order and taking care of the existing  defences and armament.     Apart from these flimsy garrisons we have no troops in China, and  the only  otherinfantry in our Colonies in the Indian  Ocean  and  Far East  consists at present of aBritish battalion at Singapore and an Indian battalion  in the  Malay States.   One  ofthese units could be reckoned on  as a reinforcement in  case of need, but it wouldrequire to be replaced by other troops within a short space of time.     2. It may be said at once that our military strength in China bears no relation tothe possible strain which might be put on it by an  outbreak against foreign action  inthat country.  In the north we act in collaboration with  other  Powers,  some of which(e.g., Japan and  America) might agree to undertake the bulk of the protective measures required ; but it is inevitable that we should be called on to participate in the task, andif we agreed to do this without very definite restrictions,  our liabilities  might  increaseindefinitely.  In the south we should have to rely entirely  on  ourselves  and for the adequate defence of Hong Kong alone, if South China were aggressive,  the provision ofsome six  additional battalions  might  be necessary.  There  is  also the  question  ofassistance to our nationals in  the treaty ports and the provision of some reserve ifoperations extending over a large area  are undertaken.   On  the whole, it may beestimated that a reinforcement of  at least one division would be required in the firstinstance, to make the military situation in China at all  satisfactory, and it is probablethat this would have to be increased subsequently.     3. The sources from which  such reinforcements could be drawn are limited to theUnited  Kingdom, India,  and the Dominions.  The military responsibilities of theUnited Kingdom and India, in Ireland, Britain, Turkey, Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia,Persia and India are already so great in comparison to  their  resources that it seemsobviously out of the question  to  contemplate burdening them  with  the  additionalliability of having to reinforce the  China garrisons in case of necessity.   More important considerations elsewhere might make it quite beyond their power to detach troops for china, and even if such assistance was possible, it might often be inadvisable  toattempt  to give it, unless the  military  situation in other theatres  was thoroughlysecure.        * 1 company, British battalion ;  1 Indian battalion.        f 1 British battalion (less 1 company); l\ Indian battalions;  200 White, 600 Indian, Royal  Artillery;     50 White, 50 Native, Royal Engineers.

     The Pacific Dominions,  Canada,  Australia and  New Zealand might be asked toassist in an emergency and would doubtless agree, as all future events in the  Far Eastmust be of deep interest to them.  This raises, however, a political question of the firstrank, which must be answered before any definite arrangement is come to.  The PacificDominions will naturally expect a much greater say  in Far Eastern questions if thesupport of Imperial interests  in these regions is to be  made dependent on their  armedstrength.     So far no military understanding exists, and no military arrangements have beenmade, for  the assistance of the Dominions in an eventuality of the nature contemplated in this memorandum.     4. The  conclusion to which we are forced is that (excluding  possible help from theDominions) we are not in a position to  reinforce adequately our very weak garrisons inChina in  the event  of an anti-foreign outbreak in  that country.   Consequently, iftrouble arises, our military action in North  China should be confined to such operationsas can be carried out with  our existing forces acting  in. conjunction with the militaryforces of other Allied Powers,  even though our prestige may be temporarily lessenedthereby.   In South China, action must be confined to  the immediate  defence of HongKong, the  existing garrison being reinforced  by  one  battalion  from the  straits settlements  and supported by such naval assistance as can be made available.   military action to protect our nationals in treaty ports, such as Canton or Shanghai, is beyond our powers.   Possibly- the Navy might be able to undertake this duty.  GENERAL  STAFF,      -  WAR OFFICE,             5th August,  1920.
