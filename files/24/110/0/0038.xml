M.H. 24.^^ALL G Jyj^morandum by the Minister1 of; Health..^    1.          The main object of this Bill  is to  impose a duty    upon  every county and county borough council, in England and    Wales to make provision, to the satisfaction of the Ministry    of Health, for the institutional treatment of persons suffering    from tuberculosis.           The provisions of clause 1 of the Bill are the necessary    corollary to the provisions in section 4 of the National Health    Insurance Act, 1920, whereby sanatorium benefit ceases to bo    one of the benefits conferred by the National Health Insurance    Acts.   Those Acts require insuranoo committees to make arrangements    to the satisfaction of the Ministry of Health, with a view to    providing treatment for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis    in sanatoria and other institutions.   When that obligation ceases .    I must be in a position to secure that adequate provision for    institutional treatment is made by overy public health authority.    Otherwise, when sanatorium benefit ceasos, there will be no    provision for insured persons in certain aroas.   Sanatorium benefit    will be discontinued on the 1st January, 1921. and legislation    this Session is requisite.    2.          The large majority of county and county borough    councils already make provision for the institutional treatment    of tuberculosis, but in some cases adequate accommodation has not    boon provided and in one or two cases the councils have not yet    made a commencement.   Clause 1 (3) of the Bill therefore provides    machinery by which the obligations of a council which fails to,    make the necessary provision can be carried out by some other local    authority or persons subjeot to recovery of expenses.
\3,          Section 64 (3) of the National Insurance Act;  1931,authorises the constitution of joint committees or joint boardsfor the joint exercise by county and county borough councils of their powers in regard to tho provision of institutions forthe treatment of tuberculosis, but the powers, of these joint committees and joint boards do not at present extend beyond this,Cluase 1 (4) of tho Bill confers on these joint committees and&apos;joint boards the powers of section 3 of the Public Health(Prevention andTroatment of Disease)Act. 1913 enabling a county or county borough council to make any arrangements for the treatment of tuberculosiswhich may be sanctioned by tho Ministry of Health and also thepowers conferred on those councils under other clauses of thepresent Bill.4.          The powers of the councils in relation to the treatmentof tuberculosis are exercised through Committees.   Clause.1(5)cf the Bill provides for the appointment to them of persons, not members of the councils, who are specially qualified by trainingor experience in matters&apos; relating to the treatment of the disoaseincluding members of insurance committees *   The aub-clause isbased upon similar provisions in the&quot;Maternity and Child WelfareAct. 1918 and the Blind Persons Bill now before Parliament.5.          The Inter-Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis(Sanatoria for Soldiers) recommended that Village Settlements andother Industrial Colonies should be established at which tuberculousmen who had received a course of treatment and training in aSanatorium could be employed&apos;under sheltered conditions *   It  isdoubtful whether the powers  already possessed by local  authoritiesenable them to establish Settlements and Colonies of this kind, and                                                                      (1it is proposed therefore, by clause 2 of the Bill, to confer- powersupon county and county borough councils to provide and maintain                                                         these/
      those establishments,  or  to  assist  in thoir  provision  and maixi-      tenanco.    It is  also  proposed  to authorise  metropolitan borough      councils  to provide  non-residential facilities consisting of work-      shops, etc., for  the training and employment, under  sheltered      conditions, of Tuberculous   perso&amp;a residing in their  areas.      6.           Local authorities arc not at  present empowered to      contribute  towards the expenses of  Voluntary Committees organised      for the purpose of providing care,  and  assistance for  persons      suffering from tuberculosis  and their families, or to  undertake      propaganda  work in connection with  the  prevention and  treatment      of  tuberculosis.   Clause 3  of  the  Bill confers the  necessary powers      for these purposes,  but provides that those  powers shall only be      exercised with the consent of the Ministry of Health.      7.           Clause 4 of tho  3111 in effect re-enacts section 39      of  the National Insurance Act.  1913, which, will be repealed      when sanatorium benefit is discontinued.   The clause  enables      the Metropolitan  Asylums  Board, which is  the Authority in London      for tho provision of hospital accommodation  for the  troatment of      infectious  diseases, to contract with any county or  county borough      council for the reception of persons suffering from  tuberculosis      in  hospitals or sanatoria provided  by the Asyluma Board,   That      Board have  already provided  several sanatoria and hospitals for the      treatment of tuberculosis In London and are  proceeding with the      erection  of two new  Sanatoria and the provision of additional      hospitals,      8.           Tho Bill contains the provisions usually inserted In      public health legislation as to the manner in which  expenses in-      curred by local authorities  under the Bill are to be defrayed.      Tho Bill  does not extend  to  Scotland or Ireland.4                                                  C. addison nistry of Health.                                  3rd,  August,1920
