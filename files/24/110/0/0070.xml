At a Meeting held on Wednesday, August 4th, 1920 at10, Downing Street the Cabinet had under consideration amemorandum by the Secretary of State for War, containing alist of prominent Turkish politiciansj ex-Ministers,Generals, Deputiesj and others, who are still being kept asprisoners at Malta (CP.1649),   It was agreed that the list should be carefully revised by the Attorney General with aview to selecting the names of those it was proposed to prosecute, 30 that those  against whom no proceedings were contemplated should be released  at the first convenient opportunity.     This decision was accordingly communicated to the attorney General, and a memorandum on the  subject by theLaw Officers of the gftown is  appended belowi     The att ntion of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs has been  invited  to the  suggestion contained inV, j concluding paragraph  of the  memorandum.

        Memorandum by  the Law Officers  of  the Crown.     The  list of Turkish subjects who have been  sent to Malta onthe  instructions of H.M. High Commissioner at Constantinople andare  there detained falls roughly into three classes -     1..   Political offenders.     2,   Persons accused of Deportations,  Pillage  and Massacres.     3.   Persons accused of ill-treatment  of Prisoners of War.     There are also some, the reason for whose detention is notstated.     The  third class is the only one which comes Yd thin ourpurview,  and vie have no knowledge as to the individuals containedin the other classes.     The  identification of those charged with the  ill-treatment ofPrisoners of War, is a matter of some difficulty,  owing to thefact that many Turks bear the same or a similar  name, the spellingwhereof varies considerably.   The only person on  this list whoappears to be quite clearly identifiable with an individual whoseprosecution has already been recommended by the  Committee whiohhas  enquired into allegations of breaches  of the Laws of War is &apos;2707 Major Mazloum Bey Edib.   The case of this  officer appearsto be a particularly bad one.   In addition, it  is possible that2676 COjellal Bey... 2679 Tewfik Mehmet, 2680 Tewfik  Ahmed, 2694Djemal Effendi Abdul and 2710 Hakky Bey Ibrahim  may be identical with persons of similar names, whose prosecution has been recom-mended, but this cannot&quot;on the information contained in this listbe established with any certainty.     So far as concerns the material that has been before us, theabove are the only persons whose detention on the  ground of ill-treatment of Prisoners of War seems desirable, but we would observe that the arrests have all been made on  the instructions of theHigh Commissioner at Constantinople.    He no doubt acted on evidence which came into his hands and reference to him would appear to bedesirable before any definite action is taken for  the release ofany of these men.                            (Signed)  Gordon Hewart,                                      Ernest. M. Pollock.4th August 1920.
