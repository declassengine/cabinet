MEMORANDUM BY  THE GENERAL  STAFF.    I circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues, a note by the GeneralStaff on the present political and military situation in Germany.                                                                  &apos;  W.-S. c.THE WAE  OFFICE,      .16th August,-1920.                          A. -THE POLITICAL SITUATION.     1.  The situation appears to be that Germany is faced with two alternatives :      (a.) To continue in her present state of subjection to the Entente, under the iron            heel of French  militarism.  (Whether she has deserved this  fate, or not,            does not enter into the problem.)     (h.) To ally herself with Bolshevik Russia, or Nationalist Russia, as the case may            be, and to break the Versailles Treaty by force of arms.     2.  The first alternative presents a  dismal  prospect.   The German  people  have- always  considered the Treaty of Versailles to  be harsh  and  unjust, and  incapable of fulfilment.   They now realize that the French, at all events, are determined to  exact their complete pound of flesh, and are intent on the destruction of Germany as a great nation.   They see a terrible  future in store for them, many years of subjection to a bitter and  hated enemy, with little hope of escaping from  his  clutches  by their own unaided efforts.     The second alternative, or at all events an alliance with  Bolshevik Russia, cannot fail to be unpleasant to the great majority of Germans, but it has great  possibilities and offers far brighter prospects.  Germany&apos;s rulers  may not like an  alliance with Soviet Russia,  but they may well argue that the German people  will never become really Bolshevik,  and will always have enough sense to hold back from  extremist action. Moreover, with a Bolshevik Russia and Poland on Germany&apos;s eastern frontier, German Communists may cause such an upheaval that, with very  little help from Soviet Russia, communism may win the day in Germany, too.     An alliance with  a Nationalist Russia  that had  succeeded in overthrowing Bolshevism would be  welcomed by the great  majority of Germans.  It may be taken as certain that  both the Prussian military party and the German Government will do everything  in their power to further a Nationalist movement in Russia  and to set up a Nationalist Government in Russia.   They have everything to gain by such a result, and their hope of its early realization may have influenced them in yielding to the Allied demands at Spa.     3.  If Germany is fully disarmed she  will be  completely at  the mercy of her  own Communists, assuming  that the latter are assisted in even a small degree by Soviet Russia.   How  can  100,000  men,  with   no heavy guns or  aeroplanes, put down a Communist rebellion in  Germany  and at the same  time guard  their wide  eastern frontier against a Red attack (not to mention possible danger from Czecho-Slovakia) ?     4.  This line of argument leads to the conviction that, if the German people ponder these two alternatives, and have no others to consider, they may perforce be led to  some agreement  with Soviet  Russia; their  hatred of France may strengthen them  in  this decision.  The only way to  prevent such a disastrous alliance, which would destroy the Treaty  of  Versailles and all other treaties, and possibly Bolshevise  the whole  of Europe, is  to  give Germany more  hope for, the future  and  more strength for thepresent.

                          B. THE MILITARY SITUATION.     1.  Germanys military strength is at present  sufficient  to keep order in her own country and to hold her frontiers against the Bolsheviks.  But if the Bolshevik powerstretches along the whole of her eastern frontier  (as  it  seems will be  the  inevitable result of the present negotiations between the Soviet Government and Poland), it wouldnot be safe to  carry out her disarmament in accordance with  the Spa programme, andit may even be necessary to allow her to increase her forces.     It must be realized that, although a German military danger may still exist, it isa future,  and not a present danger.   The Bolshevik  peril is a present  one  and far greater, and we must deal with it first, or we shall go under.     2.  The military situation is complicated by the intrigues of the  German military party in Russia, by our ignorance of the degree of success which these intrigues have achieved in obtaining  influence over the Russian Army, and by our uncertainty  as  tothe  extent to   which  the  Red  troops have  lost  their  Bolshevik character and developed into a National Russian Army.     3.  We have long known that German officers are assisting the Bolsheviks, but ithas been impossible to ascertain how numerous they are, and to what extent they areencouraged  by the  German Government, or by Prussian military leaders such  asLudendorff and  Hoffmann.  The latter in the  course  of an interview  on  7th  July,claimed that two of his own &quot;pet German staff  officers&quot;  are now serving with theRed Army, and that they keep him fully informed of the conditions.     It  seems  certain that the Prussian military leaders, probably with  the support  ofindustrial magnates, have helped the Bolshevik Army for  patriotic reasons,  becausethey hoped to  damage the lintente and eventually to  benefit Germany.   Their object was  to  employ German officers to strengthen the  Russian Army and  eventually  to turn it  into a National Army, which would overthrow  Bolshevism and set up a regimethat would be  friendly  to Germany and would rebuild Russia with  the aid of Germanbrains and industry.     4. We now come to the important question  whether the Russian  Army is stillBolshevik in spirit, or  whether it  has become  sufficiently  &quot; National&quot;  to overthrowLenin and Trotsky.  In the latter case, the Prussian military leaders  would probablybe ready to co-operate, in the  hope  of forming a Russn-German alliance that wouldrestore both Germany and Russia, and would effectively destroy the  Treaty of Versailles.If, on the other hand--as seems more probable at the present time the Russian Armyremains faithful to its Bolshevik masters, or if it is unable to shake  off their yoke, it isdifficult to imagine that men like  Hoffmann  and Ludendorff would agree to  makecommon cause  with a Revolutionary Army ; they are patriotic Germans, and  their aimin joining hands with Russia would be the restoration of Germany  as a  Great Power,not the  encouragement of world revolution.  &apos;     5. The present German Government are unlikely to take any definite side for thepresent.   It may be taken for granted that they know  all about the intrigues  ofLudendorff and Hoffmann in Russia and are ready to profit by them if successful.  Butthey  must also consider the. intrigues of Crispian,  Daiimig &amp; Co., and their possible     5.  We should  treat Germany, as long as she has a moderate Government like the present one, which moreover  appears to be making an honest effort to carry out  the Peace Treaty, as a Sovereign Great Power, though as a debtor to the Entente.   We should abandon all idea of hatred and vengeance, and cease treating the German people as outcasts and pariahs.  We should help her economically and, in fact, re-admit her to the European family of nations.  We must leave her with sufficient  armed strength to keep  order  in her  own country and to meet the Red danger, which has overthrown Poland and is threatening the whole world.    Although we must keep  a  sufficient armed  force at our disposal for use in case of real necessity, we must give up the plan  of grinding Germany  down by a constant display of military strength.  Had Germany remained helpless and without any chance of escape, such a course of action might have been possible, though it would not have been desirable or sound ; in the present circumstances it might well end in disaster.    6. We  need not go as far as Lord  Eilmarnock suggests in  a  telegram  of 22nd  July, i.e., &quot; to give a free  hand, as regards  military matters, to German  circles which are opposed to the Bolshevik movement.&quot;  But we should work out, if necessaryin conjunction with Germany,  the measures necessary  to  meet the danger, and give Germany the strength she requires to fulfil her r61e.
effect in Germany.  Like the  Prussian military party, the German  Government,  mensuch as Ebert, Simons  and Fehrenbach, or even  Stinnes  and Stresemann,  would notwelcome the advance  and final  triumph of Bolshevism, the ultimate effects of whichwould be to ruin Germany as a Great Power, even  though France  and Great Britainmight  be involved in the general ruin and the.Treaty of Versailles would be destroyed,     6.  It is urged that, for the present, our military policy as regards Germany shouldbe to await developments, and to  see what results accrue from the negotiations betweenSoviet Kussia and  Poland.   We should  not denv to the  Germans reasonable facilitiesfor self defence, and should allow  the German Government to call a temporary halt  inits measures for disarmament.   On the other hand, there is no necessity for  us to showundue  alarm at  the Eed  military menace, nor  to constitute  Germany as our barrieragainst Bolshevism, with a free hand as regards military measures.                            C. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.     1. To sum up, unless we give the German people reasonable hope for the future,and  allow Germany to  retain sufficient  armed strength  for the  present, a German-Bolshevik (or at any rate a German-Russian) combination seems inevitable,  either bymeans of an alliance or through  a German revolution.  The result cannot  fail to be disastrous to  the Entente, and would mean a fresh war &apos;:]     2. Great Britain cannot  afford to be involved  in a renewal of hostilities on theContinent of Europe ; our commitments are too great.  Nor can the nations of Europestand another great  war.  They want peace, and unless they get it, there is a seriousclanger of such chaos and anarchy as would mean the end of civilization, as we know it.The  Spa Conference  was the first  step towards the restoration of peace and reasonably good relations with Germany.   It is absolutely essential for us to continue on these linesof conciliation and discussion, tempered with firmness.     3. The great obstacle to any policy of conciliation is  the attitude of France andBelgium.  These Powers are at present opposed to  any measure for the  restoration  ofGermany, as  they consider this would be a direct menance to them.   They are  of opinionthat the German nation will never acquiesce in the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty,and  will always harbour a spirit of revenge, until  it has wiped out the humiliation  ofdefeat.   They are  afraid that  when the time comes, they  will have to face  Germanyalone, without the help of Great  Britain, Italy  or the United States  of America, andthis  idea fills them with apprehension.     It may,  therefore, be accepted as certain  that, unless and until  BVanceand Belgiumhave a definite assurance of the support of their former Allies, or at any rate of GreatBritain, they will not consent to any  measures  to promote  the economic restoration ofGermany.  They may be expected to do everything in their power to weaken Germanyand  to prevent her from recovering her former economic strength and prosperity, Avhichwould, after all, be the necessary  preliminary to successful military action.     4. If peace is  to be obtained  in Europe and in the world in general, we must induceFrance and Belgium to participate in the measures of conciliation and mutual assistanceessential to  attain  this object.  They  will  not consent  to this unless they have  asufficient feeling of security against future aggression by  Germany,  especially  as thelatter might  conceivably be  aided by Russia  The  only  way to  do this is for GreatBritain to enter upon, a defensive  alliance or agreement with France and Belgium, witha view to assuring these countries of our support against German aggression.     5. It is submitted that such  an alliance should  be concluded with the least possible delay, for the following reasons :      (a.)  Unless the nations of Central and Western  Europe combine to restore peace           and good order, there is a serious  and imminent danger of anarchy and           world  revolution.   No  such  co-operation  can be  obtained  without   an           alliance or agreement on the  lines suggested.     (6.)  A defensive alliance with France and  Belgium would strengthen our position           against  the  menace  of Bolshevism, both by  the better  relations  thereby           promoted between the British, French and Belgian nations, and also by the           spirit of conciliation which could be called  into being and developed in our           relations with Germany.     (c.)  A defensive alliance with France and Belgium would not increase our  military           commitments.  In the event of  German aggression, with or without the           aid of Russia, we should  in any case be forced to come to the assistance of           France and Belgium,  as in 1914,  in the  interests of self-defence.
(d.) Our relations with both France and Belgium are not good at the present time,.       mainly because they feel, though perhaps with little justification, that they       are being deserted by their  Allies, or at  all events  that their interests are       not  receiving sufficient consideration.  Such an agreement would result  in       more  cordial co-operation in  many parts  of  the world,  where  mutual       suspicion now exists, and would  probably have the effect of reducing our       military commitments and expenditure.General Staff,  6th August,  1920.
