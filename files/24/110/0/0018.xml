       KThis,I)Qcument is the  Property &amp;f His  Britannic Majesty s GovernmentVijjPjiZ^8    1$J     &apos;   Printed for the  Cabinet.  My 1920.    CONFIDENTIAL.       IF the  question  of  the  salaries of Permanent Under-Secretaries of State and  others had been  reached at  the Cabinet on the 29th  and I had been present, it had  been my intention to bring to the notice of my colleagues the omission from the Schedule  of the name of the Permanent  Secretary to the Lord Chancellor, to enter the strongest  protest against that omission and to press upon the  Cabinet that that officer should be  placed upon the same footing as the others affected by the proposals before the Cabinet.       I have since been informed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the omission  was deliberate, the Committee having specifically considered the case of the Secretary to  the Lord Chancellor, and deliberately excluded him.       The Committee consisted,  as  the  Cabinet are aware, of  Mr.  Asquith  and of  Lord Colwyn and Sir Joseph McClay.       I am amazed that the  Committee  should have considered,  or  should  be  said to  have considered, the question without any reference  to myself and without the means  before them of forming any judgment  on the matter.  Mo communication of any sort  was  addressed to me  or  to any of my officials before the case  was laid  before the;  Committee.   If 1 had  had  any warning  of  any kind  that the question  was under  consideration, I should have made before  the Committee the case which I  now make  before the Cabinet.  I am  convinced that, if the Committee had  been in possession of  the facts, it would have been impossible for them to arrive at the conclusion which they  reached.      The position of the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor is, in my view,  equal and necessarily equal in the duties which it performs and -the  weight  of  respon-  sibility which it involves  to that of any Under-Secretary of State.  I am responsible  for the whole administration of civil justice, aud am necessarily consulted with reference  to any changes or modifications of the law  of criminal justice.   So far as civil  justice  is concerned, it is the  duty  of my  Permanent Secretary constantly to review the law  as it  exists, to receive  from authorities of every kind suggestions  and proposals for  the amelioration of the law, and to suggest to and discuss with  me projects for amend-  ment, whether by way of Bill or by way of Rule or by way of administrative change.  Every Bill relating to any  of these matters is prepared by him or under  his immediate  instructions, and is watched by him  during its passage through  the House of Lords,  while he communicates with the. Attorney-General so  far as the House of Commons  is concerned.  The labour involved is very great.  The subjects  dealt with are difficult  and require discussion with persons of every rank  and  dignity.   It  is  necessary that  they should be conducted by an official holding high status and possessing considerable  prestige.   ;.   In addition, every Bil]  promoted  by  any other Department of the Government  which affects  the administration of the  law is necessarily examined in my office and-  discussed with the  Permanent  Secretary before my instructions are taken upon it..  There is constant  intercourse with other Departments, and 1 attach  great importance  to my Permanent Secretary being able to treat with the heads of other Departments  on terms of absolute equality.  During the passage of the Bills for which I am in any  way responsible, I should be gravely embarrassed if I could not entrust the most delicate  and  important negotiations  with; for example, the  Leaders of the  Opposition, to-my  Permanent Secretary.      Apart  from  legislation,  many reforms are carried out by Statutory  Rule.   The,  matters dealt with affect the rights and&apos;liberties  of the subject in many important  respects, and may be highly controversial.  Many codes of Rules  are made by me, and  many by the Supreme Court Rule  Committee, of which  I am  Chairman, and which,  includes the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Probate,  Divorce and  Admiralty Division, and  four Judges  of the Supreme Court,   It &quot;is the  duty of my Permanent Secretary to suggest to  me what new Rules or amendments of,  existing Rules I ought to consider, and to act as Secretary of the  Supreme Court Rule  Committee.  He must be able to discuss the reforms in question with  my colleagues on  the Committee, not only with technical knowledge, but also with considerable authority..        [4002]         &apos;
Judges are necessarily men of great independence, and  it is  essential that anyone whostands in such a  relation to  them  as  my  Permanent Secretary, must be a  man  ofconsiderable tact and of proper standing  and  prestige among other members of the Bar.     The administrative work which falls on  my Permanent Secretary is extensive and difficult.   People are sometimes misled by the smallness of the staff of my office, whichis actually housed in the House of Lords.  But my office  in the House of Lords isonly, as  it were,  the  nucleus of my Department&apos; only my Permanent and  PrivateSecretaries are there.   If the size of the office is to be  an indication  of the importanceof a Department, my office  must be treated as  including the Royal Courts of Justicewith a staff of 550, the Public Trustee Office with  a staff of 1,383, the  Land Registry;which now has a staff of 349,*but may be very greatly enlarged when the Law  ofProperty Bill becomes law.  And these  large subordinate offices of mine by no meansrepresent mere size,  questions of the greatest^magnitude and importance arise out ofthem; and all communications between these subordinate departments and the Treasurypass through my office  in the House of Lords, and  the  responsibility  for their adminis-tration and for suggesting to me  and carrying out administrative reforms in them rests on my Permanent Secretary.  I am also responsible for the administration of justice inthe County Courts, which are  about 500 in  number, and I cannot carry out my duties under the  County Courts Acts  without constant  communication with the 55 judges and with about 500 County Court Registrars, each with a staff of his own ;  thus myPermanent Secretary is responsible  for  suggesting to me all  reforms  which are neededfrom time to time in the County Court system, not only by legislation and statutory.rule, but also by administrative change.     It is not irrelevant  to refer  to. the importance which  has been attached to theoffice of Permanent Secretary in the past.  Lord Muir  Mackenzie, the first permanent secretary, was made a  Knight Grand Cross of the  Order of the Bath during his termof office, and was given a peerage immediately on his retirement,  When the offices of Permanent Secretary and Clerk of  the Crown  were united in him, he received a personal salary of   1,800, which was subsequently  increased to   2,000 a year.   On his successor coming into office,  the Treasury considered carefully what the proper salaryfor this office should  be, and came to. the conclusion that it should be   2,000 a year,thus recognising the Department as  being  on  a level with  the Admiralty, the HomeOffice, the Colonial Office and  the India Office.  My colleagues are aware that therehas from time to time been a cry for the creation of a Ministry of Justice.   I thinkmyself that there are grave objections to the  creation  of such a Ministry, and I ammost anxious to  remove  any foundation for this project  by making  my office an increasingly efficient Department of State both for carrying on the  large and  difficultadministration which properly falls upon it, and  for carrying out effectively by theappropriate method all  legal reforms which may be  desirable from time to time.     The reasons which are given by Mr.  Asquith&apos;s Committee for increasing the salaries of the heads of Departments apply with greater force  to the office of my permanent secretary than to most of the offices mentioned in the Schedule to their Report.  Theyspeak of the duties.of permanent heads  being onerous and involving  a  heavier burdenof responsibility and longer  hours than those of successful professional men and men of standing in big commercial firms,.and they point out that the duties have become moreburdensome since  the  outbreak of war.  I  can safely say  that none  of the officersmentioned in the Schedule have more onerous duties, a heavier burden of responsibilityor longer hours of  work than my Permanent Secretary, and  since the outbreak of warthe stress  of  regular autumn sessions,  of more copious legislation  and  of the more frequent exercise of rule-making  and other statutory powers is bound  to fall as heavily on him  as on the head  of any other  Department.   Mr.  Asquiths Committee hasthought fit to refer to  the opportunities for illicit  advantages m a service with access to confidential information.  It is impossible  to imagine  an office to which this referenceapplies  with greater  force th:m that  of  the Permanent  Secretary  to  the LordChancellor.     Again the Committee justify the proposed increase  of  salary by reference to the emoluments of those outside the Civil. Service, fearing lest the supply of suitable recruitsmay be undesirably limited.  The Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor mustbe a member of the Bar, possessing among other qualifications a high  degree  of  com-competence as a lawyer..   It is  notorious that the  fees now earned at the Bar have very greatly increased, and it is impossible  to attract  competent men for  the same salariesas before.  For instance, I find it increasingly difficult to obtain men good enough forthe County Court Bench at  the  old  salary of  1,500, and the work of my Permanent
Secretary is many times more exacting than that of a County Court Judge.  The salaryshould be enough to secure an adequate field of choice to any Lord Chancellor &quot;who mayhave the task of appointing a new Permanent  Secretary in future, and I say withouthesitation that it should be the sanje&amp;s that of any officer mentioned in the Committee^Schedule.                        1          .    Moreover,&apos;it is impossible to ignore the fact  that  the  status of the permanent secretary should bear some  relation to the status of  the  Minister, whose Secretaryhe is.   I have so far said  nothing about my own  position,  but  I am speaking for mysuccessors as. well as for myself, and I am bound to point out that the Lord Chancelloris a Cabinet Minister besides being the head of the judiciary  and  Speaker of the Houseof Lords, and  that  no  holder of that Office would agree to a  proposal which wouldrelegate the Permanent Head of his  Department to a position below  the Secretary ofthe Post Office and the Chairman of &apos;iMe Board of Customs and Excise.
