PART I-THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.THE   GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The situation  remains comparatively quiet as far as actual  strikes  are concerned.As regards the future it is generally expected that the ballot of the Miners&apos; Federation will go strongly in favour of a strike.    In the political sphere, the week has been notable for the display of unanimity on theKussian-Polish question by the National Labour Conference on the 13th August, who gave a mandate to  the Council of Action, and for the  proceedings of the Council of Actionthemselves in the execution of the mandate.  This significantly includes a positive demandfor immediate  peace, and recognition of the Soviet Government.    An interesting feature of the week has been the initiation of a fresh campaign for the resettlement of ex-Service men.    The Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons on the 16th August that therewere indications that the amount of unemployment during  the coming winter might bein excess of that usually caused by seasonal depression.  He announced the  appoint-ment of a Cabinet Committee to consider the position.The Unemployment Position.    The number of H.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work donation policiescurrent for the  week ending the 6th August was 110,168, made up of 109,538 lodged by menand 630 by women.  On the 30th July there were 139,866 policies current, 139,137 for  menand 729 for women.    On the 6th  August, 78,615 unemployment books,  56,008 for  males  and 22,607 forfemales, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Comparedwith the previous week, when there were 55,735 books lodged by males and 22,167 byfemales, the total increase is 3,704.    The total  on live registers for all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis ofthe unemployment position will be found on page 267.FEATURES  OF  THE  WEEK.General Topics.    Labour and Ritssia. The special national Labour Conference called by the Council ofAction &quot; to  consider the policy of organised Labour in opposition  to  any war againstSoviet Russia &quot; met at Westminster on the 13th August, Mr. W. Adamson, chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party, presiding.   Of the 1,044 delegates attending, 689 representedtrade unions and 355 local Labour Parties and trades councils.  The following resolutions were unanimously adopted :           That this conference approves and endorses the action of the three national bodies in forming       a Council of Action to deal with the present situation arising from the policy of the Government       towards the  Russian-Polish War.          That this conference of trade union and Labour representatives hails with satisfaction the Russian       Governments declaration in favour of the complete independence of Poland as set forth in their peace       terms  to Poland, and, realising the gravity of the international situation, pledges itself to resist any       and every form of military and naval intervention against the Soviet Government of Russia.          It accordingly instructs the Council  of Action to remain in being until they have secured (1) an       absolute guarantee tha,t the armed forces of Great Britain shall not be used in support of Poland,       Baron Wrangel, or any other military or naval effort against the&apos; Soviet Government; (2) the with-       drawal of British naval forces operating directly or indirectly as  a blockading influence against
       Russia;  and  (3) the recognition of the Russian Soviet Government and the establishment of un&quot;       restricted trading and commercial relationships between Great Britain and Russia.           This conference further refuses to be associated with any alliance between Great Britain and       France or any other country which commits us to any support of Wrangel, Poland, or the supply of       munitions or other war material for any form of attack upon Soviet Russia.           The conference authorises the Council of Action to call for any and  every form of  withdrawal       of labour which circumstances may require to  give effect to the foregoing policy, and calls  upon       every trade union official, executive committee, local council of action, and the membership in general       to act swiftly, loyally, and courageously in order to sweep away secret bargaining and diplomacy and       to assure that the  foreign policy of Great Britain may be in accord with the well-known desires of       the people for an end to war and the interminable threats of war.           That the Council of Action is hereby authorised to take any steps that may be necessary to give       effect to the decisions of this conference and the  declared policy of the trade union and Labour       movement.  The conference also recommends  that the Parliamentary Committee  of the Trade       Union Congress should raise a special fund to meet the financial requirements of the Council of Action,       and for this purpose impose  a levy equal to a halfpenny per member upon affiliated organisations       as and when required.     The Council of Action have been in continuous session. - On the  14th August they decided to send Mr. W. Adamson, M.B. and Mr.  H. Gosling to Paris in order to consult with representatives  of the  Confederation Generale du Travail and the French SocialistParty.  These delegates arrived in Paris on the 17th, and left the same day at the requestof the  French authorities.   Instructions were also issued to local Labour bodies and tradeunion branches for the immediate formation of local councils of action.  On the 16th theCouncil recommended all local Labour bodies to organise &quot; Peace with Russia &quot; demon-strations  on the  22nd.   This was  followed  on the 17th  by a manifesto to &quot; the workers of Great Britain &quot; demanding immediate peace, with recognition of the Soviet Republic.     It is reported  that local councils of action are being formed in various parts.  TheNational Council have clearly indicated that these councils must not usurp the powers oftrade union executives, especially as regards the withdrawal of labour,  but are  to  act ascentres of information and in accordance with instructions issued by the National Council.Some indication of the policy contemplated  by the Council is shown by their circularisingall trade unions asking for information as to orders on which members are working in themaking or transport of any  war material.     At the annual conference of the  Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Con-fectioners and Allied  Workers  on the,  17th August, Mr. W. Banneld,  secretary,  statedthat the members  of the  union might be ordered to remain at work by the Council ofAction, even in the event of a general strike.  Mr. J. Bromley, a member of the Council,speaking at Sheffield, remarked that  if a strike  were called, there would be no interferencewith the provision of food or the running of trains,  but there would be  a  stoppage of thetransport of war material or troops.     Labour and Ireland. There is no important  change to record.  The parliamentary committee  of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, however, sent  a deputation to LordPirrie, of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., at Glasgow on the 16th August, to call attentionto the unsettling effect of the position  in Belfast on organised labour in the Clyde ship-yards.   Lord  Pirrie stated that he  was hopeful of  an early improvement, and  promised that il this hope  was not fulfilled, he would be prepared to review the situation at the endof this month.     The executive committee of the Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions, at a meeting in Glasgow  on the 11th August, recommended  all affiliated unions to give financial assist-ance to Belfast textile workers now unemployed by reason of the  present situation, and decided to forward immediately an instalment of  100.     Increase of Rent and Mortage Interest (Restrictions)  Act.-It is understood that theScottish Labour Housing Association are organising mass demonstrations  in  Scotlandagainst this Act, for the 23rd August.  They  report that they have already sold  50,000rent-strike cards,* and that 60,000 more are being  printed.  In  addition to the  unionsmentioned  last week,  the Glasgow  District Council of the Amalgamated engineering union, and the  Clyde District Committee  of  the Amalgamated Union of  Shipbuilding,Engineering and  Constructional Workers have decided to recommend the  members of theseveral branches  to join in the one day protest strike.  Members are  also advised  to opposeany increase  in  rent.  The Scottish Council  of  the Municipal  Employees&apos;  Associationrecommend all branches to stop work on the 23rd.   The decision of the tramway sectionof the  United Vehicle Workers to join in the strike is also reported.    * These cards  are displayed by tenants in their windows,  stating their refusal to pay the  legalincreases of rent.     (B 1637?)                                                                 2  M 2 j]
* See p. 278,  below.*    Merchant Shipping Bill A Merchant Shipping Bill was introduced by Mr. Sextonin the House of Commons on  the 16th August.  Its provisions are reported to includeimproved accommodation for seamen and  apprentices, and a  maximum employment of eight hours a day,  or 48 hours a week, except in grave emergency.     Women and Young Persons (Empldymient in Lead Processes) Bill This Bill, drafted inaccordance with the recommendation of the International Labour Conference, at Washing-ton, that provision should be made for the better protection of women and young personsagainst lead poisoning, was presented to the House of Commons on the 10th August.     Select Committee on Pensions. On the 12th August, the report was issued of the SelectCommittee of the House of Commons  on the position as to  enrolment and training for disabled ex-Service  men, the payment of grants by the Civil Liabilities (Military Service)Department, and pensions for officers and other ranks of the mercantile marine who hadbeen engaged on war service.  The Committee recommended various measures for enforcing the National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men, and proposed the summoning of a national conference of representatives of employers and trade unions to concert measures for giving the  fullest possible effect to the scheme.   They also recom-mended the  extension of out-of-work donation for disabled men until the Committee&apos;srecommendations and the National Scheme have been made fully effective.     Building Industry. The Management and Costs  Committee  of the Joint IndustrialCouncil for the Building Trade  have  prepared a majority  and a minority report on theindustry  as &quot;an organised public  service,&quot; based on the report  issued last year by theCommittee  on  Scientific  Management and Reduction of Costs.  The  majority  report,signed by three employers and nine operatives, is divided into two parts.  The first dealswith proposals in  regard  to  unemployment, the regularisation  ot building operations,superannuation, and the introduction of methods of  costing and scientific management.The second outlines a scheme for the democratisation of the industry on principles analogous to those of Guild  Socialism.   The minority report signed  by the remaining employersrecommends that attention be concentrated on the problems of unemployment.     At the annual conference of the Council, on the 12th and 13th August, opinion on themajority report was divided.   It was  decided ultimately, however, that the committee&apos;srecommendations on unemployment should be referred to the constituent bodies, but that consideration of the second part of the report should be deferred to the next quarterlymeeting  of the Council in November.  The  recommendations on unemployment includesuggestions based on the principle of  industrial  maintenance, in addition to proposing that the  operatives  shall receive pay for time lost in bad weather, part of the cost to be covered  by  special insurance.     Housing. The Government proposals for  expediting work on housing schemes havenot met with approval from those  engaged in the building trade.*  It is understood thatthe whole position will be reviewed by the annual conference of the National Federationof Building Trades  Operatives at Scarborough on the 19th August.   Opposition chieflycentres on the suggestions with regard to dilution and payment by results.     A scheme,  however,  for the  apprenticeship of ex-Service  men between the ages of 19 and 26, put forward by the Re-settlement Committee, has been adopted by the joint industrial  Council.   The term of  apprenticeship  is to be four years for men under 23,and three years for those over this age ;  wages to start at a third of the minimum rate forjourneymen, and rise  gradually to  the full minimum rate. Industrial  and  Other Organisations.  Amalgamated Union of Operative Bahrs, Confectioners and Allied Workers. This unionheld their annual conference in London  on the 16th and 17th August.  A resolution wascarried in  favour of the establishment of a Trade Board for the baking trade.  Further.resolutions dealt with the Factories and Workshops (Bakehouses) Bill, equal pay for equalwork,  and a proposal to approach kindred organisations with a view to amalgamation.A motion that  efforts should  be made to create a &quot; triple alliance &quot; in the food industry of  the operative bakers,  the butchers  and the agricultural labourers  was also carried.The conference defined its attitude towards the present political situation, pledging itselfto support the  rest of the trade union movement, and to obey any orders issued by theCouncil of  Action.
  Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions. A scheme for the amalgamation of all  thetrade unions in the Scottish textile industry was under consideration at a meeting of theexecutive committee of the Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions held in Glasgow onthe 11th August.  It was resolved to  submit proposals to a conference of all the unions concerned to be held at Edinburgh during next month.  The meeting carried a resolutionexpressing the Council&apos;s approval of the action of the Standing Committee of the House ofCommons in  amending  the Women,  Young  Persons and Children (Employment)  Billby the deletion of the clause permitting women to work on the double shift system.Trade Union Topics.    South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. At a  meeting of the executive council,  at Cardiff,on the 14th August, the ballot on the question of the payment of increased membershipcontributions was reported as showing  a majority of 59,738 in favour of an increase.  TheCouncil thereupon decided that the present payment of 2s. a month per member shouldbe doubled as from the present month.Ex-Service Men.    Employment of Ex-Service Men.-Lord Haig appealed in the Press on the 10th august to employers,  trade unions, Government departments and the public for immediate  and concerted action  to secure employment for the ex-Service men still unemployed.   TheKing, the Prince of Wales, the Prime Minister and many other public men have associated themselves warmly with the object of the  appeal.   On the 12th a letter was issued bythe Minister of Labour giving an outline of the Ministry&apos;s proposals for the final absorption of all ex-Service men.    The Lord Mayor of London has arranged for a conference of Mayors and Chairmen of district Councils in London and  the  Home Counties on the  8th  September to concertmeasures for local action, at which the Minister of Labour will be present.

The countries represented included Great Britain, the United States, France,Belgium,  Holland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.   The chief item on the agenda  wasa proposal for a 48-hour week at sea, and a 44-hour week in port, with a fixed internationalscale  of wages.   The conference  decided in favour  of a general international strike of seamen, to force the various Governments to give legislative sanction to this demand.  Itwas agreed, however, that the International Labour Office should first be  approachedwith  a  suggestion for the calling  of a new International. Seamen&apos;s Conference  in orderthat an endeavour might be made to secure agreement between shipowners and seamenon  the question.    It is reported that the conference also adopted a resolution to the  effect that seamenshould refuse to transport troops or munitions in the event of future wars.

As regards the women&apos;s register, all show decreases except Scotland.Metis Employment.    General Outlook. As the  week has again been  in  many districts a  holiday period,the returns cannot be regarded as accurately reflecting the state of employment.  Theextension of the out-of-work donation scheme has brought on the register a considerablenumber of applicants who might not have otherwise renewed their registrations.    With  regard to the shipbuilding and allied industries,  the position has not variedappreciably.  In Scotland there are  still indications of a shortage of material, but thisfeature does not appear to  be quite so marked as formerly.  It  is reported from theNorthern Division that on the Tyne and Wear the position remains practically unchanged,except that Messrs. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., have discharged somethousands of workpeople from their naval yard, owing to slackness.  It is hoped thatthese discharges may be only temporary.  The satisfactory state of employment reported on the Tees-side still continues, and,  contrary to some Press reports, there are at present no indications of any coming  depression.    An improved outlook  is specially noticeable in  the references to the cotton trade,which shows signs  of revival.  A remarkable feature, however, is the different degrees .of prosperity shown by this staple industry in neighbouring  areas.  While depression  ismore or less acute at Preston, Chorley, Burnley and Blackburn, the trade is still active atAshton, Oldham, Nelson and  Bochdale.    Numerous references occur in the reports to the unrest prevailing in the engineering industry, and a number of predictions are  made of  an approaching crisis on the wagesquestion.  Many firms  are merely marking time, awaiting the trend of events.    There are some indications of  improvement in the  boot  and shoe industry.   Some ofthe heavy boot factories are now manufacturing medium makes.  The bad trade  recently reported in the furniture industry would appear to  be growing  worse.   Unemploymentcontinues to be on an abnormal scale in the lace trade, due  to lack of orders consequent upon the rise in the price of cotton.   Owing to the general slackness in the textile industrynight-work has been discontinued in  a number of mills, while in other industries  sections
of factories have been closed down.  Owing to manufacturers  having exhausted their stocks of raw material, the rag and shoddy trade is being affected adversely, and severalmerchants have had to reduce their staffs of rag sorters.  The position in the bleachingtrade is considerably worse, and some mills have stopped altogether, while at  othersarrangements have been made for working short time.     Industrial Developments.-T!he Brush Electrical Engineering Co., Ltd., have in viewlarge extensions in their works for the manufacture of Ljungstrom turbines  and railway and  tramway rolling stock.   The capital of the company has recently  been increased to 600,000.   The Connor Magneto and  Ignition Co., Ltd., are now  erecting a factory atCoventry  for. the manufacture of automatic  telephones, and will  employ thousands of work people when fully  started.  Messrs.  Renwick &amp; Dagleish  have  procured a  newshipbuilding yard at Hebburn-on-Tyne,  where they  expect  to commence  operationstowards the end of August.  Dumfries report that an employer who at one time employed300 men, and whose&apos; works have been closed down for nine months, hopes to recommenceshortly.  The new shipbuilding yard at Partick has been completed, and preparations arenow being  made for the building of several ships.  Messrs. Baldwins,  Ltd., are extendingtheir works at Pontypool by laying down two  or three more sheet mills.     Labour Reductions. At Maidstone, the Tilling-Stevens Motors,  Ltd., have dischargedabout 200 workpeople.  At Poole 230 men have been thrown out of employment throughthe closing down  of the shipbuilding yard of  the Gardiner Shipbuilding and  EngineeringCo.  The Morriston Spelter Co., and the Dillwyn Spelter Co. have closed their works foran indefinite period owing to depression in the spelter trade.  At Grays, Messrs. Jurgens,Ltd., margarine manufacturers, have discharged some men owing to  slackness,  and it isexpected that further discharges will be made during the coming week.     Shortage of Labour. The manager of the London (Central)  Exchange for the buildingtrades reports that the situation is practically unchanged, with the one exception that ithas  been easier to place painters in employment.   In the country as a whole, the position has  remained  unaltered.   The very serious  scarcity is  greatly retarding the progressof housing schemes.     The principal occupations in which there  is  a marked shortage  of labour are, inaddition  to skilled  building  trades,  those  of   shipwrights,  moulders,  sheet-metalworkers, coach builders, and wheelwrights.  At Failsworth the engineering trade, especiallyin its machine-tool branch, has become slacker, owing in part to a shortage of floor moulders.     Shortage of Material. At Maidstone Messrs. Sanders &amp; Co., Ltd.,. furniture and beddingmanufacturers,  are unable to re-open their wire-mattress weaving department,  owing toscarcity and high price of wire.  The scarcity of raw material is reported as retarding theactivities of iron  founders at Walsall,  enginering firms  at Earlstown, tube and boilermanufacturers at Coatbridge, and shipbuilders at Sunderland and Aberdeen.   Owing to shortage of material, the North British  Locomotive Co., Ltd.,  Glasgow, have suspendedmany of their employees.  .Womerfs Employment.     General Industrial Situation. The trade  holidays  are  accompanied  by generalindustrial slackness, and Exchange registers generally do not show great increases.   SomeExchanges, however, report that registrations are  rising rapidly, and are unusually highfor this time of the year, and the number of unemployment books lodged is rising.     The industrial depression which has prevailed for many weeks in  the factory districts of London continues, and the unskilled factory workers are unsuitable for domestic employ-ment in which the demand remains high.     The seaside Exchanges generally report some lessening of the demand from hotels  andboarding houses as the season advances, but the number of vacancies notified still remainshigh.  Difficulties also continue in finding suitable employment  for applicants registered as clerks and  shop  assistants,  although there is still an unsatisfied  demand for  skilledshorthand typists in London.     The North-Western Division report that in some areas the depression in the  cotton trade is gradually disappearing, but in others  the position in this industry  and  in thebleaching  trade is tending  to become  worse.  Slackness is reported  in the wholesaleclothing factories  at Crewe, and in the rubber  trade at Openshaw  and  Salford.     The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division report general depression in the leather,wholesale  clothing, textile and lace  trades, resulting in extended holiday periods.  Thetrade dispute in the plain net section of the lace trade in the Nottingham district continues.
      Many towns  in the West Midlands Division report that most of the factories have been closed during the week.   The slackness in the jewellery and leather trades continues. Trade  depression continues to he  reported in the boot and shoe industry in the South Midlands and Eastern Division, and the straw nat industry at Luton is going through seasonal slackness.  The hosiery trade is also very quiet.      Reports from Scotland indicate that the slackness in the textile and jute industries continues.  In Glasgow serious unemployment among women is expected, except in the unlikely event of trade reviving soon.  Fruit pickers for the  Auchterarder and Blairgowrie districts continue to go foiward from a large number of Exchanges.      Local Reports. The Deptford Exchange report that there is still great  activity in their work as the clearing house for the Kent coast Exchanges, and a number of applicants have been placed during the  week at Margate, Ramsgate and Folkestone.  It is now proposed to  draft a scheme for co-operation with Hastings  and Torquay so that women engaged in summer seasonal work  may be given an opportunity of a winter season.      The Great Marlborough Street Exchange report that  the  holiday season accounts for the  general trade slackness in the West End of London, but that there is still a shortage of skilled workers in the needlework trades.     Leyton report acute unemployment among workers in soft goods and  in the  hoot manufacturing trades.  Many  of the unemployed French polishers will be returning  to work next week.  The Hackney, Limehouse and Stepney Exchanges report general trade slackness, especially in the tailoring industry.     The Kidderminster Exchange report  that textile  firms are still able to take all skilled  workers, but that there is now no longer any real shortage of workers, as supply and  demand are about equal.     Trade depression is  still acute  in the leather industry at Walsall, and applicants are seeking daily domestic work owing to the lack of factory employment.     A report from the Bedford Exchange  states  that Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., biscuit  makers, have re-engaged many  of their workers, and on the completion of their new  works will probably engage another 100 women.     Cambridge report  an order for plum pickers, and Reading have placed a  number of field  workers for hoeing swedes.     In  spite of the depression in the textile trades in the Yorkshire  and East Midlands Division there is still a shortage of cotton weavers at Todmorden.  These vacancies cannot be circulated on account of  the lack of houses and lodgings.     Blouse machinists are  wanted at Halifax,  but the vacancies  are only for  local applicants.  In Leeds  many of the wholesale tailoring and  clothing firms are closed for three weeks owing to general slackness, and at Batley there is depression in the rag trade.     At Dewsbury there is an increase in the live register due to slackness in the rag and woollen trades.     At Pontefract applicants are being selected in readiness for the flax harvest, and from. Goole it is reported that  30 women  registered at Snaith have been placed in employment at the flax mills in Selby.   The firm will convey the workers by motor lorry.     The North-Western Division state that 16 mills  have resumed  work at Blackburn during the week, and there is every indication that before long all mills will be on full time. At Chorley several mills are working half-time while others have extended holidays.  Short time is  also being worked m  the calico printing and bleaching trades at Glossop, and there is still slackness in the pirn winding industry at Nelson.    At  Accrington there is  some revival of the Christmas card industry, and  applicants registered for slipper work, are  being persuaded to take up this work.    The Kendal Exchange report that in spite of the wet weather  there is still a steady demand for  hotel workers. The  Exchange  are  arranging to secure co-operation  of employers with a view to finding other channels of employment for the seasonal workers, preferably private  domestic service,  and a special canvass is to be made in this connection.    The Workington  Exchange have  placed  100 women and girls with Messrs. Carr, White &amp; Co., Wigtown, preserve manufacturers.    The Dunfermline Exchange report that conditions show a slight improvement in the linen  industry but workers  are not being engaged to any  great  extent.  For the flax harvest  it is expected that about 100 women and girls will be engaged.    The Galashiels Exchange have  made arrangements in co-operation with the Carlisle Exchange for two directors of the Preserve Manufacturers Co., Wigtown, to visit the Selkirk  hostels.  The firm contemplate building hostels  for imported workers and  wishto inspect those erected by the woollen manufacturers.

LOCAL  EMPLOYMENT  COMMITTEES. Activities of Committees.     Employment and Re-settlement. The Weymouth Committee have, for some consider- able time past, been pressing for the commencement of the building of the new Post Ofhce. The matter has been taken up with the Office of Works who, however,  are in difficulties with their contractor.  The  Committee are pressing for a deputation to be received by the Office of Works.   At the same time they desire to interview the Admiralty in regard to proposals they have  made for developing Weymouth and Portland  Harbours.     The Colchester Committee,  in conjunction with the Town Council,  have had under consideration the widening 01 the Colne as a means of improving the trade of the town and of affording relief to unemployment.   They aie sending a deputation to the Ministry of Transport.    Redruth have considered the setting up of new industries in  the  area, and it has been suggested that in several of the ports, notably at Hayle, excellent facilities exist for ship-breaking.  Drainage schemes at Camborne and Redruth were reported to be at a standstill, owing to the high cost of material.                                 &apos;    Training. Cheltenham reports progress in placing men in agricultural training, under the new scheme of co-operation with the County Agricultural Executive Committee. Since the 9th June, 20 men have been placed in training, six locally in  agriculture, four locally in horticulture, and ten in other areas in agriculture.    Ex-Service Men. A prominent part was  taken by members of the  Plymouth Com-mittee  in setting up the new scheme for providing ship-breaking  work for unemployedex-Service men and  men  lately  discharged from the Dockyards   Already numbers of men  who had  ceased to  use  the Exchange are returning in the hope of obtaining work on the scheme, all labour for which is taken on through the Exchange.    Richmond recommend that  the  disabled  men who have been  under training at theWimbledon Training Centre  as French polishers, and who are to  be  discharged on the13th August, should have their discharge notices withdrawn and be put back into traininguntil they are able to take up work as  improvers.    Women&apos;s Work. The  Watford  Women&apos;s Sub-Committee have played a large partin effecting considerable improvement in the services of,workmen&apos;s trains between Watfordand Berkhamsted.  As a  result, 50 women have found employment at Berkhamsted.
(B 16372)2N2              DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.  National Scheme.      Up to the 11th August, 19,205 certificates had been issued to employers.  The number  of disabled ex-Service men covered by these undertakings is 184,138.      The Newport Employment Committee report satisfactory results following the issue  to employers of a circular letter signed by the chairman ot the committee.  The Chamber  of Commerce of that town have also issued a circular letter to their members.      The North-Western Divisional Office report that the Association of Printers, Bleachers,  Dyers, and Finishers have decided to  sign a general undertaking on behalf of the com-  bined association, on the full 5 per cent, basis, calculated on the total operatives.  Placings.      The case of an ex-Service man, stone deaf and partially blind, was recently considered  by a sub-committee  of the Doncaster  Employment Committee, who considered that he  was^ unemployable, but referred the case to the  main committee.  In spite of his dis-  abilities, the Exchange  have been successful in placing him in employment.      At Mexborough it is proposed to open a brush factory for the purpose of employing  disabled ex-Service men.      At Leicester a man with 80 per cent, disability pension, owing to a gun-shot wound in the head, has been placed as an under-gardener.      The  London  and South-Eastern Divisional Office report that a blinded ex-soldier has been approved for duty at the Disabled Men&apos;s Special Exchange, and has taken up duty there.  At Croydon an ex-Service man with chest trouble has been placed as a viewer with an electrical firm at  5 per week.     Permanent employment has been found at the Southend  Golf Club for an ex-Service man who has lost a  leg.                                JUVENILE BRANCH. Juvenile Employment Committees.     New Committees.-Du.img July the Boston, Donnington and  Long  Sutton Juvenile Employment Committees held their  first meetings.  In  each town considerable interest was manifested by the  members of the committees, and although previously somewhat sceptical as to the usefulness of the committees, they were convinced that it was  within their power to perform considerable service to children leaving their local schools.    Employers&apos; Waiting Lists. The Northwich Juvenile  Advisory Committee have been making endeavours to induce local firms to give up the practice of keeping private waiting lists  for juvenile  applicants, and  to rely upon  the committee  for supplying suitable candidates for their vacancies.   Eight firms have  agreed to accept the committee&apos;s pro- posal when they have exhausted their present lists.  Messrs. Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., Ltd., will still keep a list, but have agreed to advise all boys on the list to apply to the committee.    Apprentices. At Newport the  Juvenile Advisory Committee are finding the arrange- ment&apos; satisfactory  under  which they  invite employers, through apprenticeship  sub- committees where  schemes are in operation, to state the  number of apprentices required every three months.  In this way it is possible to estimate the apprenticeships that will be available at each school-leaving period, and to use that information in visiting schools.    Juvenile Unemployment (Liverpool). The Liverpool Juvenile Employment Committee are concerned at the number of unemployed  juveniles, especially boys, in Liverpool and district.   They have urged the department to approach the Board of  Education with the object of setting  up a permanent  centre for unemployed juveniles  in  Liverpool.   The committee think that, if attendance at the centre could  be secured,  the number of un- employed boys and girls  would always justify a centre.  A copy of the resolution is being forwarded by the committee to other Juvenile Employment Committees.    Employment in the Laundry  Trade (Londori).-With. a  view to urging  upon laundefersthe acceptance of  the  conditions of employment  for  juveniles agreed between theLaunderers&apos; Association  and the London (Central) Juvenile Advisory Committee,* 130visits  have been paid to most of-the large laundries in London.  Great readiness has been shown to accept the terms proposed, and 80 launderers have signified  their willingness to
APPOINTMENTS  DEPARTMENT.                                   GENERAL.    The Editor of The Times has agreed to start a campaign on behalf of ex-Service men.The proposal was first made some time ago on behalf of the Appointments Department.Consent has now been given to make the appeal provided that all grades of ex-Servicemen are included.

Another 33 firms employ no juvenile labour.  One  or two firms  expressed the opinion that  the  overtime  clause would be difficult to adhere to, but the majority stated that little overtime would be worked.     Apprenticeship:  Retail  Bespoke  Tailoring (London).-Th.e number of boys  who are suitable for skilled occupations, and the known shortage  of thoroughly trained labour in the better sections of the bespoke tailoring trade, have led the London (Central) Juvenile Advisory Committee to investigate. the conditions  and prospects of apprenticeship, particularly in the West End.   The information shows that under the scheme of appren- apprenticeship set up by  the Association of London Master Tailors, with the co-operation ot the London Country Council Education Committee, in 1916, few boys have been apprenticed and the number is not increasing.  This is due to  the deplorable conditions under which much of the West  End work is done, and to the fact that a large proportion of the work is in  the hands of aliens.   Not more than 5 per cent, of West End work is completed on the firm&apos;s premises,  and such premises are frequently unsatisfactory, and  situated  in basements needing artificial light. Most West End work is  carried on in back shops. One man usually secures several  blocks of  premises and lets out seats to the workers. They, therefore, and not the firm for whom he is working, pay the rent.  In other cases work is Carried on in tenement dwellings or other dwelling-houses where  the worker lives, and shares the workroom with  his family and assistants.  In  the latter  cases the conditions are stated often to be incredibly bad.    The present rates of pay for a 48-hour week are stated to be from  4  18s. to  5 18s. for males, and from   1 15s. to  3 10s. for  females of  18 with  not less than one year&apos;s experience.  The piece-work rates are usually considerably higher, and the rates earned by first-class workers are very good.    The London  (Central) Juvenile Advisory  Committee feel that, although there are excellent prospects in the trade for good workers with business ability,  until the adverse conditions can be  altered it will not  be possible to advocate  the trade for boys of the better type, except with employers providing satisfactory workshop accommodation.

The Director at Edinburgh reports that a representativeof a London  firm visiting Glasgow was, within two hours of his application, provided with a traveller for a large advertising scheme.    There has been an increase in the number  of new registrations during; recent weeks.Inquiry showed that a considerable number of the applicants had already been placed by the department, but that their employment had ended.    The Glasgow Eotary Club have established  a  special sub-committee to  co-operate with the Appointments Department.    In  the  Manchester Directorate depression  continues.   In most industries there appears little prospect of  immediate improvement.  An applicant  for training  underthe Royal Warrant was, with  the assistance of the Mayor of Altrincham, put in touchwith the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., Ltd.  This firm have arranged to train the applicantin Sarawak,  and retain him in their service on the completion of his draining, and aredefraying the whole of the expenses.
TRAINING   DEPARTMENT.                              EX-SERVICE  MEN.General.    Building.-Representatives of the department have conferred during the week withrepresentatives of the &quot;Ministry of Health, with regard to the arrangements for carryingput the suggested  scheme whereby certain building work, under  the Brighton housing scheme, will be carried out by men in training.  The Ministry of Health have promisedthe department every possible  assistance in connection with this important development.    Elementary Teachers. Details  in connection with questions of accommodation andequipment of the  proposed training  college for  elementary school teachers at Birtleyhave been settled, and the Board of Education have now been asked to give their officialrecognition to the scheme in order that Treasury  sanction may be received.    Glove-making.-A proposal for the training  of ex-Service  men in glove-making incertain parts of the South-Western Division is being investigated and negotiations arestill proceeding  with the  trade interests.  Efforts are being made to secure that thelearner&apos;s wage, payable by the employer  towards the end of the training,  shall be more reasonable that that so far proposed.     Manual  Instructors. Of four men training as manual instructors at the WimbledonTechnical Institute two gained first-class certificates in the City and Guilds of  LondonInstitute  Examinations and two gained their first-year  certificates.  The two formerhave now received appointments under the County Education Authority.     Exhibitions. The Divisional Director of the  South-Eastern Division states that, as aresult of  the recent exhibition, a number of orders-for  weaving and  for  baskets, havebeen placed  at various centres, and  that employers are beginning to show an enhancedinterest in the general scheme.     A small  exhibition of the work done by disabled men at the different factories andcentres in Wales was arranged in  connection  with the National  Eisteddfodd at Barry.This  exhibition was visited by several thousands of persons, the furniture exhibits, thesamples  of  clothing from the tailoring  classes  and the hand-woven tweeds from theLlanwrtyd Training Centre being specially admired.  The tweeds found a ready sale. ,     On the  6th August, Major David Davies, M.P., invited all the  Welsh members  ofParliament, and a number of men  of influence in Cardiff and district, to accompany himon a visit to the East Moors  Government Industrial Factory.  The party were  receivedby the Controller  and the Divisional Director, and after an inspection of the factory  a visit was  paid to the site on which men in training are erecting four houses in  connectionwith the Corporation building scheme.     Hostels. A canteen  and possibly hostel accommodation  will be  required  at  theKirkdale  Factory  and a mess room at Hornsey.  As regards the hostel at Brockenhurstfor men training in forestry, a suggestion has been made that the management should bein the men&apos;s hands under the  direction of the instructor.   As at present advised it seems probable that all the Brighton hostels will be retained.     Government Instructional Factories. At the Claydon Factory, the carpenters and joinershave been engaged  in making the shop benches and tailors&apos; tables, with very creditableresults.  At  Sarisbury Court the carpenters and joiners are still engaged in making andfixing cubicles in  the residential part of the factory, the work on which has also givenemployment to a number of other men in training.     It is hoped that possession of the Spring Bank premises at Hull will be obtained early next month.  In  the meantime 60 men are in  training in temporary premises  and thenumber will be gradually increased.   Training  has at last started at the Derby StreetGovernment Instructional Factory, Cheetham, Manchester.     At the Birtley Factory a recreation room has been opened.  The portion of the Birtleyvillage allotted to the department  has now a population of 635 men, women and children.It has been decided that the men in training here shall erect four houses in connection withthe Walker Gate housing scheme, and the conversion of the premises, which it is proposedto  use as a training college, is to be carried out entirely by men in training.Treasury Sanctions.     Since the issue of the last Report the following proposal has received Treasury sanction.     Expenditure  upon alterations  and  adaptations to  the Government Instructional Factory,  Luton.  These premises  will provide 290 training places.
Ex-Service  Men-continued.Schemes Sanctioned.    During the week 14 schemes, providing 140 places, have been sanctioned.  Includedin this number are  80 places for training in various branches of the furniture trade.National Trade Advisory Committees.    Furniture. A meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee was held on the5th August.  At the previous meeting the question of approval of training in convalescentcentres was.considered, and the committee though sympathising with the object of trainingin such centres,  were unable, having regard to their commitments to the disabled  men,to approve of such training.   The question was reconsidered, and it was resolved that before coming to a final decision a deputation consisting of two employers and two tradeunion representatives should visit the convalescent centre at Epsom.    The question of the  relaxation of  trade union rules was adjourned for information to be obtained as to the number of men who have completed training, the  number of trained men who have not continued in the industry, the number now in training, and thenumber who have been passed by Local Technical Advisory Committees as suitable.    It was unanimously  resolved that inasmuch as the personal allowance of 27s. Qd.payable during training in 1917 was increased in 1919 to 40s., owing to the increased costof living, the time has now arrived when a further increase should be given.                           WOMEN &apos;S  TRAINING.General.    Dressmaking  (Harrogate). All the trainees  from the Harrogate dressmaking  classhave found satisfactory employment, several as  resident linen and sewing maids at  40and  45 a year, others as wholesale machinists at the local union rate, or as home dress-makers and one as an assistant housekeeper in a college at  52 a year.    Tailoring and Waistcoat Making (Shrewsbury).-T?h.ese classes have been visited  fromheadquarters, and were found to  be making excellent progress.  The principal of the firm in whose premises the training has  been given has suggested that,  if the traineesfailed to find employment, they should remain in  the rooms over the shop at a small rent and take in work at local piece-rates.   The firm  would supply a considerable amount ofwork, and work would also be available from other firms in the town.    Dressmaking  (Shrewsbury): This class is busy on high standard work,  which is being done well and quickly, and the trainees carry it  out on their own responsibility. Manyof the girls seem  concerned as to their propsects of obtaining employment owing to theslackness in the dressmaking trades, but it has been suggested to them that they should notconfine themselves to trade workrooms, but should look for posts as sewing maids, school-room maids and  ladies&apos; maids.  The Chief  Woman Officer  of the local   employment exchange has promised to make every effort to find suitable openings of this kind.War Widows and Dependants.    Statistical.-During the week ending the 7th August 238 new applications were received in connection with the scheme for training war widows, bringing the  total to 2,731.  Intwo further cases training was authorised, bringing  the total of sanctions to 1,401.   Nineapplications  were rejected  or  withdrawn,  and there were  two  further  instances  ofwithdrawals.  In 11 cases training was completed.  At the end of the week there were 344war widows in training, and 677 had completed their training.    Since the transfer of training powers to the Ministry of Labour on the 1st September,1919, 1,495 applications from war widows have been received.  During  the  same period674 have been sanctioned, and 783 have been rejected or withdrawn.Disabled Nurses.    During the week two new applications have  been received from disabled nurses, onerequiring sedentary work and the other making inquiries as to training.  One applicationfor training  in  infant welfare work and  one in  health visiting received sanction.   Anextension of three months&apos; training in secretarial work was granted to a nurse whose dis-ability prevented her from making sufficient  progress during  the  usual  six  months&apos;course.

                        APPRENTICES AND BOYS.                        INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS. Questions Affecting the Scheme.     Wages.-A feature of the working of the scheme has been the frequency with which provision is made for rates of wages in excess of the  minima qualifying for the State Grant, which are three-quarters and five-sixths of the full journeymen&apos;s rates, in the first and second halves of renewed apprenticeship.  In fact, the great majority of the appren- tices accepted  are qualified to receive more than these minima.  Under  16 of  the  41 approved schemes the apprentices are paid at the  minimum rates;  under 11 at rates exceeding the minimum, but  less than the full rates; and  under 14 schemes the  full journeyman^  rate is paid for the full period, or some  portion of it.  Nearly  27,000 apprentices, of the 39,000 under the scheme, or about 69 per cent., are in receipt of more than the minimum, and the remainder are receiving the minimum.  More than half of the latter, however, are employed under  schemes which give special privileges in other directions such as a longer  allowance than ordinary in respect of  military service, and, in the case of the printing and bookbinding schemes, the payment of the State grant at the age of 19 instead of 21.     Local  headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area  point out that small firms may be very hardly hit, where a rapid increase in the wages  of the journeymen is taking place.  They illustrate this by the case of Mr. J. J. Lucas, Harwich, builder, whose staff consists of one man and an apprentice.   He took the latter under the scheme when the local prescribed rate was Is. 3d. per hour and the employer^ share of the wages $%d., and 10c?. per hour in the two halves  of renewed apprenticeship.  The rate has now risen to Is. lid. per hour, and the employees share is more than he feels able to pay.     Period of Renewed Training. An apprentice, formerly with another firm, has been brought under the scheme by Messrs. White, Wilson &amp; Co., Cardiff, nearly a year after his demobilisation.  In the meantime he got work where he could,  mainly in erecting temporary buildings for the Royal Show at Cardiff.  It is maintained that in this work he learnt nothing of his trade, and local headquarters concur in this view to the extent of recommending that only part of this period shall count towards his apprenticeship. The Scheme in Operation.     Statistics. Up to the 11th August, 41 schemes  had been  approved, and applications had been received in respect of  all  of them. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices,  for the week ending the 2nd  August,  was 160, making a total of 42,783.   The number of applications received from apprentices was 184, making a total of 48,055.     Up to the 11th  August, agreements had been received  at headquarters in  respect of  41,039  apprentices.  Grants  had  been sanctioned in respect of 39,442 apprentices, employed  by 15,698 employers.   Of  these 4,117 were under the engineering scheme,  and 6,548 under the building scheme.   The total number of agreements lapsed  on  the expiration of  the appropriate period of training  or by mutual agreement between the parties is now 8,670.     Applications. Reports from Sheffield  indicate  that the  recently approved  cutlery scheme is being well taken up, and that applications are coming in satisfactorily, although, so far, those of apprentices have been the more numerous.     At Aberdeen cases under the scheme continue to be received, and in all 1,250 agree- ments have now been  forwarded to headquarters.   During the week of the  Aberdeen trades holiday 20 were sent forward.  In the past great  difficulties have been experienced in this area.     Acceptance  or  Non-Acceptance. Messrs. Swan, Hunter  and Wigham  Richardson, Ltd., Wallsend, shipbuilders and engineers, are increasing the number of their apprentices under the scheme.  They already have some 18 under it, but have had difficulties in dealing with theirs wages claims  and other  matters of administration.  These  have now been adjusted through the agency of local headquarters.     Messrs. Baker &amp;  Finnimore, Ltd., Birmingham, pen makers, raise the point as to whether a man can be placed under the scheme after the expiration of his period of training, in order to secure for him the benefit of the State  grant.  While he was completing his&apos; training, they paid the man two-thirds of the journeymen&apos;s rate, and now that it is finished they wish to obtain the State grant for him.  If they can do so, the whole of it will go to the apprentice, who is a married man.
Apprentices  and Boys-continued.    Cases have been reported from time to  time in  which employers  have chosen toapply the scheme to selected apprentices only, in some cases selecting those whose employ-ment under the scheme was likely to prove of pecuniary advantage to the firm.  Messrs.J. Dixon &amp; Sons, Whitehaven, furnishers and upholsterers, who have two eligible appren-tices, have brought only one under the scheme.   The other apprentice has only just learntof this, and the matter has been taken up strongly by local headquarters.   As a result the firm have reluctantly agreed to bring the second apprentice under the scheme.    Non-Observance of Conditions. Local headquarters for the Yorkshire and East Midlandsarea complain of the unbusinesslike methods of co-operative societies in their area, andof the frequency with which  the claims submitted by them are incorrect. -  Claims, forinstance, have been made for apprentices for as long as  a year before they become entitledto grant,  or apprentices&apos;  signatures have  been obtained in advance for money  to bereceived up to the summer of  1921.    Training in Operation :Progress-Messrs. K. Laidlaw &amp; Son,.Ltd.,  Edinburgh, gas-meter manufacturers, state that the apprentices are making steady progress, but not over-exerting themselves.  This is owing to trade union interference which does not allow themto do any extras or work overtime.  Moreover, most apprentices regard technical training as mere drudgery, bringing no extra pay.   The firm fear  that the paternal relations hithertoexisting with their apprentices, who are mostly sons of employees of many years&apos; standing,will disappear.   It should be pointed out, however, that the technical training referred tois apparently given in evening classes, after a full day&apos;s  work.     Unemployment. Cases continue to  be reported in which owing to shortage of work or other causes, apprentices under the  scheme are being, or are likely to be, dismissedor put on short-time.   Thus at Otley, the Brenner Machine Co., a small firm of engineers,fear they may have to discharge some of their apprentices as they have more fitters than are needed to  deal with  the  greatly decreased  output of  their foundry.  Two of theapprentices, however, have recently withdrawn voluntarily, and it is hoped that no dis-missals may now be necessary..    An apprentice under the scheme with Messrs. J. B. Bowes, Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne,printers, complained  that he  was put  upon short time, while  another  apprentice, not&apos;under  the scheme, remained upon full time.   Local headquarters have induced the firmto cancel this arrangement and put back the former apprentice to full time.                               GENERAL TRAINING.Apprentices: Conditions and Training.    Supervision of Training. In the building industry  at Preston, opinions are expressedin favour  of fuller and more definite  supervision of  the training of apprentices. Animportant local firm of painters and decorators, for instance, consider that reform in theapprentice question is long  overdue, and that the trade  is  not  getting workmen  of the requisite quality.  The reasons for this are the lack of any definite system .of training andsupervising apprentices, and the inadequate facilities for technical training.     The Preston district secretary of the operative painters&apos; society is prepared to supportany  action that may  be taken by the department to deal  with the situation and has promised to take  the  matter  up with the local secretaries of other trade unions  in theindustry.   The officials of the Burnley Master Builders&apos; Association are also prepared togive full consideration to the  question.  At  Liverpool, the Merseyside Labour EducationCouncil are willing to support schemes for the proper training of apprentices, and desireproper co-ordination between workshop  training and general education.     Shortage of Apprentices  (Building). Shortage of apprentices appears to exist in east anglia, as well as in other parts of the  country. Local  headquarters for the  SouthMidlands and Eastern area report that employers are  undoubtedly taking great interestin the apprenticeship question and are  fully alive to the seriousness of the prospect.     Wages Problems-In  the coppersmithing trade at  Glasgow the  bonus  payable toapprentices at 18 appears to be causing  small firms to get rid of their apprentices as they reach this age.   The amount of the bonus is 32s. per week, so that an apprentice receiving 1 per week, just previously, rises automatically to 52s.   The trade unions are experiencingdifficulty in dealing with this matter as the apprentices in question are  not  members.

The first meeting of the executive committee of  the District Council for the NorthernHome Counties met on the 12th  August and considered a number of applications  forincreased wages, made in respect of employees of the Acton, Ilford and Tottenham urban district Councils.  Further consideration is to be given on the 26th August.    Building.-Th.e  Council met on the 12th and 13th August.  It was decided to putinto  operation the  apprenticeship scheme put forward by the  Education Committee,pending full reports from the constituent associations, and that the Scottish representatives should get into touch with the Scottish Education  Department in order to get support.    The Safety and Welfare  Committee reported that the Secretary of State  for theHome Office was considering draft regulations based on the first report on safety regulations for woodcutting machinery.    The report of the Resettlement Committee was adopted, together with the scheme foradult apprenticeship put forward by Mr. Thompson.  It was decided after discussing the cabinet&apos;s proposals for a national  agreement in relation to the housing scheme that, infuture, the Resettlement Committee should be the  only body  to negotiate, and that areport should be prepared in reply to the Government^ proposals.    The Resettlement Committee  will meet the Cabinet again on the 17th August and present  the report which  has  been drawn up.    The Management and Costs Committee presented a unanimous report on the schemeof insurance  against wet time.  After a long discussion, during which the employers putforward no suggestions for a compromise, it  was decided to  remit the report  to theconstituent bodies for consideration.    Printing. There have been no developments in the situation.  The Liverpool and manchester branch  of the Typographical  Association  have  changed their tactics andhave applied  for a regrading of these two towns in  place of an additional bonus of 10s.This application  translated into terms of money, makes no  difference  in their originalclaim, as they are asking  for the two towns to be paid 10s. a week more than they  areentitled to by present agreement, raising the amount to  5 2s. Qd.  The Executive of theAssociation are now  supporting their branch in this claim, and as it is now clearly in order under the National Agreement, the employers  consider themselves  bound to meet andnegotiate on the claim.  They have agreed to withdraw the lock-out notices, provided the embargo on overtime is lifted and a guarantee given that it will not be re-imposed withouta fortnights  notice.Government  Industrial.    War Office. The Council met on the 12th August and decided to appoint an executivecommittee.  It was agreed that constitutions for works committees should  be  ratified by the Council.  With regard to the representation of unions at a preliminary conferenceon the subject of works committees, it was decided to alter the suggested representationfrom two or&apos; three delegates to one representative for every 50, or part  of 50, membersemployed in the establishment  concerned, with a maximum number of 10 representativesfor any one union.  The next meeting will be held  on the 21st October.        JOINT STANDING  INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS :  WORKS  COMMITTEES.    Brewing. At the  request  of the Northumberland Brewers&apos; Association  severalbreweries in the Newcastle and Sunderland area have  been visited, and the scheme for works committees discussed with the managements.   Inquiries  have been resumed inthe Suffolk district, from which it appears that the employers met the trade unions in conference some time ago, and  decided not to proceed at present with works committees.    flour milling, Investigation of existing works committees is  being continued in theLondon and South-Eastern area, and it has been found that both employers and work-people are generally very pleased with the results  obtained since  the establishment ofthe joint  committees,   various disputes have been settled, and  much  valuable welfare

Dressmaking  and  Women&apos;s  Light  Clothing Trade  Board  (Scotland).-The  Boardconsidered objections lodged against their Notice of Proposal dated the 26th May.  Theyresolved to fix minimum rates as proposed, and to suggest that the rates as fixed should become effective as from the 5th September.  The Board considered co-operation withthe Juvenile Advisory Committees concerning the  employment  and training of  juvenileworkers,  and agreed to invite a representative of the Juvenile Branch to attend their next meeting.  The  Board resolved to appoint a Standing  Committee to whom theydelegated their powers  as regards the granting of permits of exemption, and it was also    (B16372)                                                           2 0 2work has been accomplished.  In Glasgow the attitude of the milling industry employerstowards the formation of works committees is very undecided, and a lead from one or twoof the principal firms would be followed by the greater number.    A  constitution for works committees, in accordance with the recommendations  ofthe Council, has been adopted by the Joint District Council for the Manchester district,and the Ministry have been empowered to visit all the mills in the area.  arrangements have been made to address  meetings of the Federation of London Flour Millers, and theScottish Joint District Council.  A meeting of the London workers&apos; delegates committeewas addressed, and agreed to do everything possible to render the works committees effective.    Pottery.-M.my firms are not yet in  full working order after the  annual holiday,and the negotiations for establishing works committees have been consequently impeded.Messrs. Wildblood, Heath &amp; Co., Messrs. J. H. Cope &amp; Co., and Messrs. Roper &amp; Meredith,all  of  Longton,  have  decided  to  proceed with the formation of works  committees.Arrangements have been made to address a meeting of the workers employed at the twoworks owned  by Messrs. Hewett Bros., Longton.  A joint committee has been established at the  works of Messrs. J.  Lockett &amp; Co., Longton.  Among  other matters dealt withhave been the questions of  timekeeping, fuel, hot water and first aid.  The principal ofthe firm is  of opinion that this committee has been of great value.      INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES: REPORTS.    Clay-The Committee  met on the 12th  August to endeavour to reach a settlementof overtime rates.  A meeting of the Negotiating Committee on the same day had ended in a deadlock, though agreement was reached on all the points at issue except rates forwork on  Sunday and holidays, for which  the employers  offered time-and-a-half,  and the employees claimed double time.  At the full meeting a  long discussion was brought toa close by a resolution carried by the employees&apos; side that the  question should be left to direct local negotiations and that meanwhile the Interim Committee be suspended,  the calling of any further meeting being left in the hands of the two secretaries.    Furniture Warehousing and Removing. The Committee met on the 12th  August.It was  decided not to accept the resignations of Mr. Lock, of the  National Union of general works, Mr. Hilton,  of  the  United  Carters&apos; and Motormen&apos;s  Association,  and  Messrs.Mayes  and Taylor, of  the Furniture Warehousing and Removing Association, but to ask them to reconsider their decision on the ground that, in the view of the trade union side,the industry would rank only as a branch of general road transport unless the Committeecontinued in  existence.    On the question of the enforcement of  wages agreements it was  decided to writeagain to  the  Ministry  expressing the Committee&apos;s conviction that the Government must take powers to make wages  agreements arrived at by the joint  bodies legally  enforceable.    In regard to the application of the National Union of Vehicle Workers  for  a wagesincrease, it was announced that the result of the ballot among  members of the FurnitureWarehousemen and Removers&apos; Association, Ltd., showed an overwhelming  majority foradhering to the present agreement, which should be maintained until the 31st December.The trade union side  expressed surprise at this decision and considered that as a deadlockhad now been reached, the  Committee should adjourn sine die.

As regards  the examination by Local Employment Committees of applications for permits of exemption, it was agreed to inform the Minister that they would be glad to avail themselves of the offer in special cases where the Board desired to obtain information. It was further agreed to call attention to the fact that among representatives of employers there  were none from  country districts, and to affirm the opinion that country districts and small businesses should be represented.     Shirt-making Trade  Board (Great Britain).

Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring  Trade  Board (Great  Britain). The Minister  has made  an Order  dated the 6th August confirming general minimum time- rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates as varied and fixed for male workers,* and he has specified the 16th August  as the  date from which  these rates shall become effective.     Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order dated  the 7th August, confirming general minimum piece-rates fixed  for hand  machine braiding, and overtime rates as varied for certain classes of workers, and has  specified the 13th  August as  the date from  which these rates shall become effective.           The overtime rates, as varied for  workers employed on the piece-work  referred to above are       . the appropriate  general  minimum piece-rate with the following additions : For the first two hours        of overtime, on any day except Saturday, Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays,        one quarter of the piece-work basis time-rate which would be applicable to the worker if employed        on piece-work for which no general minimum  piece-rates had been fixed.  For overtime after the        first two hours of overtime on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays        and for all overtime on  Saturday, one-half of that rate.  For all time worked on  Sunday and on        customary public and statutory holidays the whole of that rate.           All hours worked in any week in excess of 48 are to be paid for as overtime irrespective of the        number worked  on any particular day,  and the overtime rate is also to be paid where on any day,       not being a Sunday or customary public or statutory holiday, the number of  hours worked exceeds       9,  or, in the case of Saturday, exceeds 5, notwithstanding that the number of hours worked in tha       week does not  exceed 48.

The number of awards issued during the week was 15, of which  13 were under the Industrial Courts Act.     Great  Western  Railway. Claims by the  Amalgamated  Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional workers  and the Amalgamated Engineering Union for advances of wages were held not to have been established, but the Court decided that stores clerks (issuers) should be rated in three groups at 5s., 5s. 4dL and 5s. Sd.   (Awards Nos. 431, 435 and 436.)     Heavy Chemical  Workers:  Leblanc and Electrolytic Soda Processes. It was held that the  claim for  an advance  of wages had not been established, but the Court considered that arrangements should  be made to minimise risks.  (Award No. 440.)     Clerical Workers  (Leeds). Clerks between the ages of 14 and 25 employed by Messrs. C. E. Fulford, Ltd., Leeds, patent medicine manufacturers, were granted minimum wages, varying with age, from 20s. to 80s. per week for males, and 12s. to 50s. for  females, senior clerks and similar grades to receive 25 per cent, over the  highest minimum in the scale.  (Award No. 441.)     Labourers on Public  Works  Contracts (London). An advance of  2d. per hour was granted  to  the labourers  concerned, and  corresponding  advances  to stone-dressers, rammermen,  concrete levellers, screeners, steam-roller drivers, platelayers, tar-pot men and  sett-dressers.     Cokemen (Dowlais and Cwmbran). A claim  that the  wages of cokemen employed at ovens connected with ironworks of Messrs. Guest,.Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, Ltd., should be regulated by colliery terms and conditions, and not by the South Wales and Monmouth- shire iron and steel  workers&apos;  sliding  scale,  was  held  by a single  arbitrator not to  be established.                      AGREEMENTS AND  SETTLEMENTS.     Boilermakers (Tees-side). A settlement was reached  on  the 2nd August.  Pieceprices to be fixed by agreement.  Shop committees to be f orated for the different sections, and in fixing piece prices the firm will ask the committees to quote a price.   If approved,the estimate  will be  made up on these  prices.  Should the committees not agree, thedistrict delegate is to be called in.  Previously the firms fixed prices without consulting the men.  In the case of Messrs. Dorman, Long &amp; Co., Ltd., negotiations are taking place with a view to establishing a bonus on output of finished material.    Checkers  (Middlesbrough). A strike affecting 40 checkers commenced  on the  30thJuly at the Middlesbrough Docks.  Under the dockers&apos;  award checkers were entitled to3s. 9d. per day increase, and overtime at time-and-a-half.   Formerly  they had receiveddouble pay for overtime.  The  employers were willing to accept  the Award and to makeretrospective  payment, but  were not prepared to go further.  The  Chief ConciliationOfficer intervened, and it was arranged that the checkers should be paid in accordancewith the  award, but with double time for  overtime from the 10th May to the 30th July.
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 227.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 5, 31st July, p. 192.     Margarine Workers  (Fulham). A conference was  held  by the  Chief Conciliation Officer at the request of Messrs. Van den Berghs, Ltd., on the 10th and 11th August.  The firm stated that the strike* was brought about by a demand for higher wages when the limit in relation to output had already been reached.  The firm felt sure that the work- people could increase production, and they were prepared to pass  on to the workpeople the  saving in cost of labour,  which would represent a sum closely approximating the increase demanded.  The firm proposed that on the  resumption of work a joint works committee be formed  to arrange the calculation and division of  such savings.  They would not guarantee any advance  on rates,  but were prepared to give the women an increase of 2s. per week on account of their share from the output  bonus scheme.  They expected to take back two-thirds of the workers immediately, and the remainder soon.     The union representatives  were prepared to recommend resumption on these lines. The firm consented  to discuss  the scheme with the unions within four or five days of resumption.  It was agreed to resume work on the 16th August.                  QUESTIONS  PENDING AND  MISCELLANEOUS.     Textile  Workers (Scotland). The Glasgow and  West of Scotland  Tape Dressers Society have notified the department that their members are not prepared to accept the advances granted under Industrial Court Award No. 397.  This Award granted an advance of 15 per cent, on current earnings, resulting in a weekly wage of  4 16s. id.   The rate for similar operatives employed in the manufacture of muslin has recently been increased to  5 Is. 6d. per  week, the previous  rate in both cases having been  4 4s. Od. per week. The society claim that coloured work tapers in Lancashire receive 10 per cent, more than those on muslin work,  and that this principle has been  revised under the award.     Council  Employees (Cardiganshire). The Council  meeting  arranged for the  4th Augustf discussed the claim of the roadmen for 55s. per week, as paid by the Carmarthen County Council, and a representative of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union subsequently met a special committee on the question.  The Council offered 48s., that is an increase of 6s. per week, but this was refused.   The offer appears considerable, and  the  Chief Conciliation Officer is arranging  to meet the union district secretary.    Iron Workers  (Westbury). On the 12th July the 150 men employed by  the New Westbury Iron Co., Ltd.,  struck.at one hour&apos;s  notice in sympathy with three men discharged for refusing to attend to the fires  on Sundays.   Some of the men grew tired of working the Sunday shift, for which they were paid at the rate  of time-and-a-half. The  Acting Chief Conciliation Officer, Bristol, suggested to the strike committee that if the firm refused  to  start these three men, but would  agree to an inquiry, the  strike committee should abide by the decision arrived at.   The men agreed, but the firm refused. The  men are apparently determined to continue the strike.    Cold Storage Men and Warehousemen (Glasgow). At Glasgow about 500 members of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union, employed in cold storage and other large warehouses, ceased work on the 24th July, to enforce payment under the dockers&apos; award.  The  employers contend that the men do  not  come within the award.  The question had been referred to the Negotiating Committee  in June last by the men&apos;s union. The  committee then decided that the men came under the award, but the employers disclaimed  the right of the committee to adjudicate.  They also  complained that  the decision was based on an ex parte statement and that sufficient time was not  given fortheir representative to  attend.    After the strike began the employers asked the department to arrange for arbitration.The  Chief Conciliation Officer,  Glasgow,  tried to arrange a meeting hut the men would only attend if the employers recognised the Negotiating Committee as  the sole body tosettle the dispute, and if there should be no  local settlement short of the award.  Theemployers still refuse to negotiate before the committee.

APPENDIX.                          QUESTIONS  IN  PARLIAMENT.     The following extracts from the Official Eeport of the proceedings of the House of Commons  relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested. Minimum  Wage.     Mr. Hogge asked the Minister of Labour whether the need for guaranteeing a minimum wage sufficient for subsistence to all workers is as urgent now as when a recommendation to this effect was made by the Joint Industrial Conference representing both employers-and employed ; and why the  Minimum Wage Commission Bill has not been proceeded ; with.                    M     Dr. Macnamara : I am afraid I am not in a position to say when it will be practicable to proceed with the Minimum  Wage Commission Bill.   But my hon. friend will not lose sight of the fact that much of the area of the wage field is now covered, and is being further covered, by the creation of machinery to deal  with wages through the medium of mutual agreement.  The Joint  Industrial Councils  alone cover a  number of workpeople approximating  to 3 millions.  And as regards that part not covered and  representing the less well-organised industries, my hon. friend will be interested to know that as a result of the Amending Trade Boards Act of  1918, 40  Trade Boards, in addition to the 13 existing under the 1909 Act, covering about two million workers, have been established. This means that at the present time 2\ million workers are covered by the Trade Board policy.  I may add that by this time next year we  hope that the number just given will be increased to something like 4j or 5 millions.     Mr. Hogge: Does that mean that a minimum wage has been definitely refused ?     Dr. Macnamara : I do not say that.   I said I could not say when it would be practical. In the meantime, much is being done in other directions. (llth August.) Appointments Department.     Viscount Curzon asked the Minister of Labour if any decision and, if so,  what has been come to with regard to  the  future of the  Appointments Department consequent upon  the  reduction  in  the work of the department  owing to the maintenance and-training grant scheme coming to an end very shortly;  from what date will these new arrangements take effect; and will the result  of these new arrangements be to  place the Appointments Department under the control of the officers now in charge of the Employ- ment Department of the Ministry of Labour.     Dr. Macnamara:  I welcome the opportunity given me by my noble friend of explain- ing a matter about which misconceptions appear to exist.  There is a considerable overlap between the activities  of the Employment and Appointments Departments, and it has become increasingly clear that  to promote smooth working and secure economy a closer co-operation between them was  desirable.   It is recognised, however, that it is necessary to preserve the separate entity of the Appointments Department and to maintain its existing machinery.   All that is proposed,  therefore, is that the director of that depart- ment in each of the areas should work under the supervision  of the divisional controller who already is a general representative of the Ministry within his division, and that the headquarters office will be under the Principal Assistant Secretary in charge of the Employ- ment Department.   In other respects the organisation with its separate offices  and staff will not be disturbed.     Viscount Curzon: Have these new arrangements been considered by the Committee now dealing with future unemployment ?    Dr. Macnamara: I cannot say that this question has nothing to do with that inquiry.     Viscount Curzon:  Is it proposed to continue this Appointments Branch permanently ?
Appendix- continued.    Dr. Macnamara :  It will continue as long as there are officers for whom we are seekingappointments.  The moment they are all employed I hope it will not be long delayed,although I fear it may the branch will disappear.    Brigadier General Gockerill:  Can we have an assurance there is no intention of dis-placing disabled officers who have secured appointments in this branch ?    Dr. Macnamara:  Certainly, there is no such intention.  We have under government orders given preference to ex-Service men,  and particularly to disabled men. (llthAugust?)Reabsorption in Industry.    Sir Walter de  Frece asked the Minister of Labour how many ex-Service men  havebeen reabsorbed  in industry; and how many of these have found employment throughthe medium of the Employment Exchanges ?    Sir M. Barlow:. Of the total number of men demobilised or discharged up to the endof July, approximately 5,000,000, it is estimated that the number not yet reabsorbed into industry is about 200,000, and it may be  assumed that the balance of about 4,800,000have  been reabsorbed into industry or provided for  otherwise.  The number of  such men for whom employment has been found  through  the medium of the EmploymentExchanges is 564,403.    Mr. Raper:  Does that refer to men only, or does it include officers ?    Sir M.  Barlow: I believe it includes officers, but I am  not quite certain, withoutnotice. (10$ August.)Cost of  Living.    Mr. C.  White  asked the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour  whatwould be the effect on the index figure of the cost of living of a rise of 2\d. in the price ofthe quartern loaf.    Dr. Macnamara:  An increase of 2\d. per 4 lbs. of  bread, without a corresponding increase in the price of flour, would raise the index  number by four points.  With acorresponding increase in the price of flour,  the index number would be raised by a furthertwo points, making six points in all. (llth August.)    Mr. Newbould  asked the Parliamentary Secretary  to the Ministry of Labour what isthe range of working-class incomes in respect of which  the increase in the cost of living isto be considered to be approximately the  average increase for a member of the working class as given in the Labour Gazette index figure; whether the increase in the cost of livingfor the least-skilled and lowest-paid workers is more or less than the said average;  and,if so, by approximately what percentage.    Dr. Macnamara:  The  average percentage increase in prices, as given in the LabourGazette,  is an average  applicable to  the working  classes generally.  Statistics are notavailable to show the present range of working class family incomes, or to enable trust-worthy  comparisons to be made of the percentage increase in prices for different sectionsof the working classes.   It would appear, however, that at the present time the percentagerise  in  prices for the lower paid classes, taken as a whole, does not differ greatly  fromthe general average.  I am sending my hon. friend a copy of an extract from the LabourGazette of March of this year, from which he will see the scope and method of compilationof the index figure. (llth August.)
