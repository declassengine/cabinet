August 1920. SECRET.C.P.-1747.CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT.JOINT MEMORANDUM  BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.    1. WE  attach, for the information of  our colleagues, a memorandum which dealswith the possibility of heavy unemployment during the winter, examines the machineryavailable for dealing with it, and suggests  certain  lines of enquiry as to the measureswhich may be necessary.    2. We think that the memorandum  shows quite clearly that  a strong CabinetCommittee to cover the whole ground should be appointed immediately.    3. We need not recapitulate the suggestions which are made in the memorandum,beyond saying that they divide themselves into the following five heads:--    (a.) Development of unemployment insurance;    (6.) The application of systematic short time ;    (c.) The expediting of public works :    (d.) The provision of labour camps ; and    (e.) The possible establishment of national  factories in trades where it is clear          that Government enterprise would not have the effect of pro tanto damaging          private enterprise.    4. We do not pretend that any or all of these  suggestions are either final or would cover the ground, but we  are strongly of opinion  that if the situation develops, as  itwell may,  action to be effective must be immediate.   Delay in formulating a plan  willnot merely lead to heavy financial commitments, but might  involve the  country informidable difficulties.                                          (Signed)      C. ADDISON.                                                        T. J. MACNAMARA.    August 6,  1920.   THE PRESENT POSITS AND PROSPECTS OF DISTRESS DUE TO UNEMPLOYMENT.    1. Except for a few months immediately after the  war there has been no period of distress on a large scale in this country for twelve years.  Even at that  period theposition was anxious and occasioned much public uneasiness.   Since  that date theindustrial  position has  changed out of all  recognition, partly as  a result  of  normallabour development, but still more as a result of the immense changes brought about by the war.  It has  left labour not merely with a  completely new  view  of  and claimupon  the  State,  but in addition has left  the formidable task  of dealing  with theunemployed ex-service man.   It  is therefore  obvious  that  if  unemployment  even..approximating to that of 1905 to 1908 were encountered  the country would be face to face with a situation the difficulty of which it is impossible to exaggerate, unless the-Government were prepared in advance with far-reaching measures.    2. There are indications at the present moment that we are on the  eve of  serious;and even alarming unemployment.  It is true that the statistical records of the Ministry       [4045J                                                          B
of Labour do not support this fear.   The  latest  figures show  the number of personsJuly 1920.146,000 84,000                                                                230,000                                                                 48,000                                                                 25,000                                                                  3,000-     In  July 1920 out-of-work donation was payable to many ex-service men, and thishas no doubt led to many of these men being upon the registers of the exchanges whowould  not otherwise have appeared.   The total  number of  ex-service  men nowunemployed may be estimated to be 200,000.   Figures for able-bodied men in receiptof poor  relief, otherwise than in the casual wards, are not  available, but  the  numberis quite  small and may be ignored.  These figures show an unemployment percentageof less than 2 per cent., which is one of the lowest on record.     But as against  these  favourable  figures there must be set a number of factors which appear to indicate that they are misleading :      (o.)  It is known that  in a number of important industries workpeople are  being           rapidly discharged.  Information is reaching the Ministry of  Labour from           various parts of the Country indicating that the work is slackening  off.     (6.)  Various reasons for this decline are suggested by employers, but whatever the           real reasons, there is little doubt  that  contracts are  being cancelled, and           that new orders are coming in slowly as compared with the position even           three months ago.     (c.)  It must be further remembered that many persons now unemployed  may not           so regard themselves, because they are on holiday and are living on savings           which they  have acquired during the past year as a result  of the high           wages which have obtained.  It would not  be the  first time that the           registers  of  the unemployed were suddenly swelled immediately after the           summer holidays were over.  It is therefore possible that during September,           and still  more October, a serious- increase in unemployment may develop,           and it is essential that preparations should  be put  in  hand  on the           assumption that this will happen.     3. In these circumstances it is necessary to consider what the existing machinery is, the extent to &quot;which it is inadequate  or  faulty, and what remedies  to meet thepossible trouble ban be devised.                            (A.)-Existing Machinery.     1. There is of  course a long  history of the  steps which  have been taken  at various  times to  deal with distress, and  there is a considerable body of  authoritativeopinion  upon the mistakes which have been made in the past in handling the problem.There are attached accordingly two notes prepared  at the Ministry of Health (a) a notegiving an outline of  poor law administration in the past;  and ( .) a note summarising the recommendations of various commissions and  committees which have consideredthe problem.     It is the fact that  the Government  are preparing  legislation to alter  the wholepoor law basis. It has  not yet been  possible to give effect to this intention, but itappears  to be clear  that the  responsibility for dealing with all phases of unemploy-ment must be definitely allocated to and shouldered  by some other one Departmentthan the Ministry  of Health-presumably the Ministry  of Labour.     2. The actual machinery available for dealing with distress due to unemploymentmay be summarised as follows :-     (a.)  3,750,000 workpeople are insured  against  unemployment under the Un-           employment Insurance Acts,  1911-1919, and will be entitled, subject, to           the provisions of those Acts, to unemployment  benefit at the rate of 11*.           per week until  the 8th November  and  15s,  a  week thereafter  (for a           maximum period of fifteen weeks annually under the new 1920 Bill).known to be unemployed at the present time as follows               Registered at            Employment Exchanges.        Ex-servicemen...        Other men      ...       ...       ...                            Total        Women        Juveniles (under 18)    In casual wards of workhouses
     (o.)  The Unemployment Insurance  Bill (1920) will bring into insurance another           8,500,000  workpeople.   These, will, provided  that  they  are in regular           employment  between the  8th   November and  the  6th  December,  be           entitled to eight weeks&apos; benefit under the Bill from the latter date.  After           drawing eight weeks&apos; benefit they will be entitled to further benefit in the           proportion of one week&apos;s benefit for every six  contributions  paid up to a           limit of fifteen weeks within any period of twelve months.     (c.)  Ex-service men are entitled to receive out-of-work donation in respect of any           unexhausted rights under the demobilisation scheme, or where these rights           have, already been exhausted or have lapsed, to receive donation at 20s. per           week in respect of  eight weeks during the period  from the 1st  August to           the 8th November.     (d.)  Some 3,000,000 trade unionists are entitled to some weekly payment from           their societies during unemployment.   Practically all of these are or will           be also insured under the Government scheme.     (e.)  Distress Committees  under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905,  have           power to maintain registers of unemployed persons, to provide  work  and           to assist emigration.  Their funds are to be drawn from charitable sources           and from rates.   The rate levied  may not exceed  \d.,  and  no Exchequer           grant  has  been made since 1914.    (This grant  has never  exceeded           300,0001 and has never been fully expended.)     (/.)  The Poor Law  has always  served  as the ultimate  relief authority, charged           with the duty of preventing starvation.     It can give relief to the able-bodied in three forms :                (a.) In institutions (workhouses);               (6.) On the performance of work in a labour yard ; and               (c.) In money  or in kind.     A distinguishing  feature of  poor law  assistance is that it consists  of  relief           calculated on a man&apos;s  physical  needs,  and  not upon wages related  to the           work performed by him.                       (B.)-Defects of Existing Machinery.     1. Each of these measures, and  indeed all taken together are inadequate for thefollowing reasons:      (a.) Insurance. It is true that a large  number of  workpeople will come  into           insurance after the  8th  November, but it must be remembered that in any           event for all new entrants two conditions will apply :      1         (i.) That they  will  have to  pay four contributions before admission;              (ii.) That the maximum amount of benefit to which they can be entitled                     during  the  year following on the Act is eight weeks after the                     6th December, and thereafter one week for every six weeks of                     employment up to a  maximum of fifteen weeks within  any                     period of twelve months.    It follows from this  that  if unemployment become severe  before November or           during  November,  a large number of unemployed persons will not be in           benefit  at all.  In  addition, if unemployment becomes  increasingly  severe           and prolonged, an even larger number will be out of benefit after the eight           weeks have expired.    Moreover, if unemployment is both severe and prolonged and  the  Trade  Union           funds are beginning to be depleted, it is more than likely that there will be           a very strong  demand for drastic  alterations in the conditions both as to           the number of weeks available and the amount of benefit.    (o.) Ex-Service Men.-A largenumber  of ex-service men  who have  been out of           employment   since   demobilisation will  be  out  of donation  on  the           8th November.  The very men who are  the most troublesome will certainly           not get  into employment during November, and will therefore during that           month and in  the ensuing months, unless there is some further extension of           unemployment donation,  be entirely without  assistance in  the  form of           benefit.   It must be remembered that by far the larger proportion of these           men are not trade unionists, and cannot  therefore look to their societies.      [4045]                                                         B 2
    (c.) The  Trade Unions will, of course, pay  out  benefits in accordance with  their           rules, but it is not impossible, even though their finances are generally in a           very good state at present, that  some  unions notably, the lesser-skilled,           whose  experience  of  unemployment benefit is small may  rapidly find           themselves  insolvent.    (d,). So far as Distress Committee work  is concerned, the failure to  discriminate           between various types of unemployed persons has made this an entirely           unsatisfactory means  of  meeting the  position.   It has  naturally proved           impossible  to  provide work of a kind to which many  of the unemployed           applicants  are accustomed,  and  consequently workpeople are  employed           upon  work generally work approximating  to navvy&apos;s  work for which           they are unfitted.   Largely as the result of this, but partly, too, because of           the limitation in the  rate of wages  paid, and in the absence of effective           supervision, it has proved impossible to obtain  a reasonable standard of           work  or  output upon relief  works.   A heavy financial loss has  in almost           every case resulted, and the work itself is demoralising to workpeople of a           good type.    (e.) It is certain, so far as poor law relief is concerned,  that any general imposition-           tion of a workhouse or labour &quot; test&quot; would be keenly resented,  especially           by  and  on behalf of  ex-service  men.   The unconditional  distribution of           out-relief  is   demoralising  and  extravagant,  and would  produce  an           increasing body of discontented  and idle men to become the victims of           subversive propaganda.                             (C.) Suggested Remedies.    It appears therefore that some new measures must be prepared.  The position isone of  such  difficulty  that it is felt by both Departments  that it  is  essential thata strong Cabinet Committee should be set up  at once to explore  the whole position.In advance of that examination it  is not felt that  any definite policy can be propounded,but the Committee might explore possibilities in  the following directions :     Speaking generally there are three  big  avenues of, approach to a  solution of theproblem     (1.) Insurance.   . (2.) Spreading employment as widely as possible.  .. (3.) Stimulating necessary work of  a  public  character,  notably  the housing           schemes  and  the  road  programme, both of which  may  easily absorb           a proportion of the unemployed.    1.  Insurance. It has already been indicated that it may be necessary to increasethe number of weeks and the rate of benefit in certain circumstances.  Even if this isnecessary there is no reason to suppose  that the Unemployment Fund would becomeinsolvent, and in any case provision could bet made for State assistance to  the fundwhen it reaches a low level.  This would be a far better, more universal, and cheapermethod than  subsidising the trade unions, which is another possible alternative.    But this does not cover the case of the men  who have not got into  benefit; that isto say, it leaves out of  account the most troublesome section  of  all, the  ex-service men,for it, is assumed that the unemployment donation will not  be further extended afterthe 8th November  except possibly for  the disabled men.   In  any  event,  it may benecessary to make some  provision for admitting persons who have not paid contribu-tions  into the  contributory scheme.   This could  be  done without damaging  theprinciple of contribution by permitting persons who had actually not been employed topay the full  joint contribution for four weeks,  provided that they were accepted for insurance by the Local Employment Committee as  being on their industrial recordsbond fide insurable workmen.     2.  Spreading of Employment.-(a.) One obvious method of meeting the situation will be to advocate short-time in all  industries where  the depression is operatingdirectly.  A  lead has of course been given in this  direction by the cotton, wool andboot and shoe industries.   Similar schemes could,  and  should, be  arranged throughthe Joint Industrial Councils, the Trade  Boards and other  joint  organisations  of an authoritative character throughout the country.  It may be necessary to go so far as totake powers to make short time compulsory  throughout a trade with  the consent  of the
appropriate trade body.  But  at the same time it would be vitally important that keyindustries, such as coal and steel, should be  encouraged to continue on full time aslong as there is a reasonable prospect of the raw material which they  are producingbeing required for industiies  working on short time.  Nothing  must be done, forexample, which would so&apos; reduce coal supplies and other key products as actually toincrease the depression.     (6.)  It  is further obvious that negotiations with the building trade must be pressed forward  to the  furthest point  possible&apos; to  absorb  the large  numbers  ofunemployed men that could be taken in by that trade.     3. It is desirable that local authorities  should be asked immediately to indicatewhat their  programme as  regards roads and other  public  works  is, and to  giveindication of the dates at which they propose to proceed with these, and the reasons, ifany, which  are  preventing progress.   There is  no doubt  that  finance  will be thepreponderating question here, and the question of spending money  to assist  localauthorities will  have to be examined,  with  always three  provisos: (a) that  labour required  for housing schemes is not drawn to other work;  (b) that the work is carriedout on strict  economic lines, and that, for  example, labour-saving appliances are notjettisoned in order  to employ more men ; and (c) that the persons employed are thosewho would  normally be  employed for  the work namely, those who are best able todo it.     4. Even on these lines it is clear that there may still  be  a considerable body oflabour unprovided for.  This labour will really consist of industrial derelicts, including a proportion of the ex-service  men who belonged to this class before the war, or whohave  drifted into it since.  It is a real question whether these people should  be leftto the ordinary operations of the Poor Law or whether special consideration should begiven to them.  If it is decided that special consideration must be given, then it mustbe borne in  mind that there will still be a sediment which cannot be dealt with except by the Poor Law.     If for that  proportion which is  not entirely beyond  hope it is desired to make some provision, then  it is  suggested that it might  be worth while to explore thepossibility  of constituting camps which would bear considerable resemblance  to thelabour battalions  to which incidentally many of  the persons who would go would beaccustomed.   The persons who were  prepared to go to the camps  would be fed andhoused  and  receive  pocket-money,  together with a  separation allowance for  their families in return for  an enforceable undertaking that they were willing for a  specificperiod to be trained in general labouring work.   In fact, they would be sent to work with a pick  and shovel.  It is quite possible that  the more  efficient  companies mightbe employed on road work and the rest on reclamation or similar work.   These campswould, of course, be entirely voluntary in the sense that nobody would be compelled to resort to them, but if  persons refused to resort to them, then the position would become clear that they are fit  and proper subjects for the Poor Law. .     5. There have  been from time to time proposals that the  Government should usenational factories for  commercial production. This has always been resisted  on theground that it is uneconomic because in the  long run such a  proposal would  nearlyalways  mean that some  private  trader  would  be  put   out of  business  with theresult that the volume of unemployment would remain  unchanged.   It  may, however,be possible  in view of the  difficulties of international  credit to discover certain trades in which production is less than it  might be  because  manufacturers are not preparedto take the  very considerable risks.   The Government might  consider whether theywould, if such trades  existed- and this would have to be explored-on a  strictly limited scale start  production in three or four of  the great national factories.  From the psychological point of view of the ex-service men, the establishment of national factorieseven on a  small scale would certainly have a profound effect.   Moreover,  shouidprivate enterprise protest against intrusion  into their sphere,  it would always be opento the Government  to say that if it were generally felt  by private enterprise  that thiswas competition, they would be prepared to hand over  the factory on the Governmentsterms which would of course include guarantees that an equal output were secured fora guaranteed period.     6. There is, further, the possibility of  giving industrial training  to fit men inestablishments of the Ministry  of Labour in a limited number of trades which will not immediately be affected by the depression trades which must for many years be short of their necessary complement.     This proposal will naturally encounter great opposition, but it is  not impossible that in such trades as tli2 steel trade it  may have a real value.

    7. There  are probably other measures which  will  suggest  themselves to theproposed  Committee, and many  of those suggested  may, on examination, proveunsatisfactory.   The, vital point is, however, that, if the  fears of heavy unemploymentare justified, instant consideration must be given to the problem.  The  essence ofdealing with the situation is preparation in advance.    Ministry of Health.    Ministry of Labour.             August 4, 1920.
APPENDIX (A).                     NOTE UPON POOR LAW ADMINISTRATION.     1.  THE administrative ideal of the reformers of  1834 undoubtedly was that relief should not be given  to the able-bodied except in an institution.  In no other way they  argued could the State make the necessary provision for maintaining distressed  persons  adequately  without  inviting the pauperisation of  persons who could if they would make the effort necessary to provide work and maintenance for themselves. Moreover, the complete removal of the workless from the labour market during  any period in which they could not  fully maintain themselves reduces the opportunities for under-employment and the cutting of wages, and thereby acceler- ates the return of the market to normally healthy conditions.  Further, by checking the congregation of idlers at street corners,  &amp;c, it reduces the  probability  of out- breaks of disorder.     It is, however, only fair to the reformers to point out that they contemplated that a workhouse would have at any rate some educative and recuperative effect, and that after a  period of residence in a workhouse the able-bodied would  certainly be no less able than before to maintain himself and his family.     2.  In  practice, however, this ideal of administration was not obtained by the Poor Law  Commission and their successors even in a period  of good  employment. The regulations governing the administration of relief issued by them fell into groups, represented by the two series  of orders eventually  crystallized  by &quot; The Outdoor Relief (Prohibitory) Order, 1844,&quot; and &quot;The Outdoor Relief Regulation Order, 1852.&quot; The former order was generally  applied to  rural and semi-rural parts of England and Wales, the latter to the more populous  and industrialised.  The former, as its name indicates, prohibits all relief to  the able-bodied outside  an institution.  The latter permitted the grant  of such relief provided the recipient performed a labour test.  The  labour test was directed to secure as much of  the object of the  workhouse policy as public sentiment wTould permit by (a) taking the relieved man off the labour market  for a full working day,  and (b) giving him in return for his work not wages for the  amount of work done or the time spent at work,  but relief calculated on the needs of the man and his family.  At least half of this relief was  to be given in kind and not in money.     It might have been thought that these conditions would have been sufficient to make a  labour test a very efficient instrument in the hands of the  Commissioners and one may cite as a curious example of its success the case of the cotton famine in which the test  imposed was that  the men relieved  spent their  day in a schoolroom doing nothing.  In fact, however, the difficulties of administration and the &quot;humanity &quot; of the local administrators  produced an effect opposite to that intended.  As a result there has been on the one hand inadequate supervision and on the  other a proportion- ing of the  time on work demanded to the amount of relief required.  Two or three slack days  in the yard with the rest of  the time to himself is acceptable to a man of low type, and rapidly demoralises one of a better class.   The labour yards therefore became  attractive to some  classes, and there was extreme difficulty in closing them after they had been opened.  Moreover, relief in them was given&apos;  not only to persons who were in any modern sense  able-bodied, i.e., able to earn a  full wage, but to the inefficient and elderly in whose case the reformers of 1834 would have certainly made no exception to the  rule of  indoor relief, unless definite infirmity  could be shown, in which case outdoor  relief  without a labour  test would  have  been given.  (As an example of how  the times change it may  be mentioned, though it is not strictly relevant, that there is on record a discussion between the Commissioners  and a Board of Guardians of the question whether a man  of 80 is or can be  &quot;able-bodied.&quot;)    Public sentiment and  possibly the limitation of accommodation  in workhouses led in most cases of acute distress from unemployment to the supplementation of the Prohibitory Order by a Labour  Test Order, which practically made it equivalent for the present purposes to the Regulation Order.    31.  Towards the end of the cotton famine some attempt was  made to  providepublic works, not at the cost of the Guardians, at which the unemployed  operativesmight earn their living and &quot; should not continue  to be relieved either in idleness oron the performance of a task of  unremunerative labour,&quot; but the effects were  not
great.  In 1886 was issued Mr. Joseph Chamberlain&apos;s famous circular suggesting the provision of work by local authorities rather than by Guardians, the object being to relieve distress  due to unemployment  without attaching to the relieved personany Poor Law stigma. , This policy has been re -enunciated from time to time but hasnot been a success : since  in practice the difficulties of administration have made theCorporation work indistinguishable from that in a labour yard, without the advan-tage of the  trained investigation of cases by the Guardians&apos;  officers, and with anincreased temptation to meet distress by  doles of two  or three days&apos; &quot; work &quot; at atime, leaving the men who had been assisted  free to  compete with men who were endeavouring to keep their families without assistance.     Moreover, the Corporation work being ostensibly more or less a definite job thescheme had  not even such advantages as the labour yard had  in being continuouslyavailable until the end of a period of distress.     4. Theobjectionto the workhouse test and the labour test led early in the twentiethcentury to the invention in Whitechapel of a modified  form of workhouse test whichwas  recognised by regulations issued to Whitechapel and a number of other Unions.The  object of the modification was to allow reasonable opportunities  for  seeking work.  The man himself was compelled, as a condition of relief to his family,  toremain in the workhouse for five, or six days and to seek work..  This form of test wasin operation in a number of Unions at the time of the introduction of the UnemployedWorkmen Act.  Particular reference may be made to Poplar, which  possessed afarm colony (Laindon), designed to accommodate men on the modified workhouse test.     5. The  mixed character of the inmates of a workhouse has always rendered it a difficult matter to secure proper discipline when a number of  able-bodied  men werein receipt of indoor relief; and arrangements have been made  from time to&apos; time for setting apart a particular workhouse as  an able-bodied man&apos;s workhouse.  Such 3workhouse has been  used while the families, if any, were in the workhouse, of theirown parishes; or in conjunction with relief under the modified workhouse test order.The Belmont Institution with  its farm, accommodating a maximum of 2,000 men,managed by the Fulham  Guardians, was  so used comparatively recently in London,and  will be available for use again if this  should be required.  In addition a numberof Boards of Guardians have institutions  of their own which are  designed for  or could be adapted for this  use.  The Laindon Farm Colony has already been mentioned the difficulty of such special institutions has always been that they are not made useof in times  when distress is not abnormally great and  consequently are converted toother purposes.     The disappearance of able-bodied pauperism during the war and the change in the content of pauperism which has for some  time been  far more largely composed ofsick and infirm persons and children, has  emphasised this aspect of the position, andthe Government Unemployment Donation prevented any necessity for special action under the Poor Law in the difficult times that followed the armistice.     6. During the  last year  there  was much  distress in  some northern  Unionsas a result of the  coal strike and  the  moulders&apos; strike.  It was decided by theMinister of Health      (1.)  That nothing should be done by the Poor Law for men who were actually           on strike.     (2.)  That the families of these men might be relieved.     (3.)  That non-strikers should be relieved.     (4.)  That the Ministry of Health should not advocate the  imposition of any test,           but should undertake to sanction any departures made by the Guardians           from the Relief Regulation Order, 1911 (which repealed and amalgamated           the Prohibitory Order already mentioned).     (1),  (2) and (3)  are based upon the ruling given by the Court of Appeal in the           Merthyr Tydfil case.     In some instances the relief machinery was swampecTand  attempts to investigate the  circumstances of the applicants were futile.     In the  Hems worth Union relief, on account of the distress caused by strikers. was given in over 13,000 cases, and in one day the number of applicants reached on one occasion as many as 1,000.   The Guardians of the Rotherham Union gave relief, amounting  to some 6,700Z., to over 5,000 families of strikers.     At Derby relief given to  ironmoulders&apos;  labourers amounted  to 2,380Z.  In the same Union 3,433L  was expended in relief to the families of strikers involving 300 women and 1,000 children. At Dewsbury an expenditure of about 700Z. was incurred,
and over 550 strikers&apos; families were  relieved in Wakefield.  Other  Unions whichhave been similarly affected are the North Bierly, Hunslet, Pontefract and WortleyUnion.    7. The Unemployed Workmen Act of 1905 was an attempt to carry into generaloperation the practice of the Lord Mayors Fund, opened in the previous year to dealwith distress in London, and to apply to this such safeguards as Poor Law experiencewould suggest.  It is possible that good results might have beeli obtained if the break with tradition had been more Complete.  As things turned out the limited amount ofmoney available for distress committees and the general dislike of the new practiceled to practically the reproduction on a larger  scale of the labour yards and Corpora-tion  work.  The  regulations issued by the Local  Government Board  did, indeed,^require  that any person employed  should as far as possible be afforded continuouswork, biit  full advantage appears to have  been  taken of the  words &quot; as far  aspossible,&quot; and in the majority of cases the makeshift work was not suited to many ofthe applicants and was insufficiently supervised.  In the case of the large farm colonyat Hollesley Bay,  belonging to the Central Unemployed  Body for London, therewas a more definite attempt to introduce new  methods, but the success obtained was hardly proportionate to the effort expended.    It is possible that some real alleviation of  a period of acute unemployment mightbe obtained  by  the provision of additional work which  would employ men  at theirown trades and at the standard wages, thus  removing the surplus  from the labour market, but there is nb hope  of anything more than a day to day  reprieve fromstarvation from Distress Committee work continued on the lines which have been thepractice.   In  its  effect on the workmen it is undistinguishable  from workhouserelief, the reaction against which it represented.    A scheme  of work for wages to  relieve  unemployment cannot co-exist  with asystem of public doles, if the two provisions are available for the same class of men.Nor within the  same limits can the co-existence of work for wages and a labour yard(or Corporation work of the old style) be justified.   The workhouse test is imprac-ticable as a universal measure for relief;  a  labour  test and Corporation work ofthe old style have always failed; and the indiscriminate doles on application not onlyare indefensible in principle, but would be unprecedentedly costly, particularly afterthe experience  of the unemployment donation.  The  only untried expedient is thatof full work for wages, and this clearly cannot be applied to all  distressed persons.It is unlikely that any permanent line of policy can be settled until the Ministry ofLabour take over.APPENDIX (B).SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO POOR LAW REFORM.           Majority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws.    THE Majority Report proposed that there should be set up in every district a statutory Committee of  the  County or County Borough Council to be called thePublic Assistance Authority, and that the  Public Assistance Authority should actlocally through committees, and work in close co-operation with three other organisa-tions  to be established, namely,  a  Labour Exchange,  an Unemployment Insuranceorganisation, and a Voluntary Aid Committee.  .    The Public Assistance Authorities, either by themselves  or in combination withother, authorities, were to provide (1) for those requiring temporary maintenance and work, complete or partial home assistance, or assistance in industrial or agriculturalinstitutions proposed to be established for this purpose, and (2) for those requiringa longer period of maintenance and work with training, assistance in labour coloniesestablished for the  purpose,  or  in the industrial or  agricultural institutions just mentioned.  For those requiring  detention and discipline it was proposed that detention-tion colonies should be established by the Home  Office.
          The Minority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws.     The Minority Report proposed that a Ministry of Labour should be established to deal with the whole question of labour and employment.   The proposed  Ministryof Labour was to deal with the following matters: (1) Labour Exchange, (2) TradeInsurance, (3) Maintenance and Training, (4) Industrial Regulation, (5) Emigrationand Immigration, and (6) Trade Statistics.     The Ministry of Labour  were to establish! and maintain receiving; offices in thevarious centres of population where able-bodied men in distress  could apply forassistance.  They would then be assigned to day training  depots or residential farmcolonies, according to their needs, their families being meantime maintained in their homes.  It was also proposed that the Ministry of Labour should establish one ormore detention colonies of a  reformatory  type  to which magistrates could commitmen convicted of vagrancy,  mendicity,  &amp;c, or breach  of discipline  in a  trainingdepot.                            The Maclean Committee.     The  Maclean Committee  recommended that each County and County  borough council should appoint a &quot; Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee,&quot;which was to take measures for the prevention oi unemployment and for administer-ing, whether  by themselves  or  in  federation with other  local  authorities &quot; anyspecialised provisions of the kind required.by the unemployed.&quot;     The  Maclean  Committee did not suggest that the Local Authority should begiven any powers of compulsion or detention, although they thought that new powersof this kind would undoubtedly be required.  The Committee, however, consideredthat it was not strictly within their province to formulate  a policy for the treatmentof the able-bodied  unemployed, and they  suggested that  the Government shouldinstitute  an enquiry into the  nature of these powers of compulsion and detention,and the authority to which they should be entrusted.o
