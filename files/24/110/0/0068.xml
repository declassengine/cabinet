THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC FiAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.                    WORKMENfS COMPENSATION.                j*,h.26.            Memorandum, by tho Minister of Health,       Tho Memorandum by the Homo Secretary on the subjoot of  legislation to amend the law as to Workmen^ compensation  (C,tM74C) contains a number of proposals which directly concern  the Ministry of Health and which will roqulre very careful  examination by my Department,     .  Tho proposed scheme is concerned largely with questions of  Health and&apos;National Insurance, each of which matters fails within  the province of the.Ministry of Health, and it is important that  .  overlapping and divided departmental responsibility should be  avoided.   It will be seen that the Home Secretary proposes (a)  that  the arrangements for providing further medical and surgical  aid to injured workmen and for utilising the services of medical  referees should be coordinated with the arrangements now under  consideration by the Ministry of Health for the benefit of the  population generally, and (b) that the arrangements for securing  compliance on the part of employers with the proposed measure of  compulsory insurance should be carried out by the Inspecting Staff  of the Insurance Department of the Ministry of Health.       In view of the functions which it is proposed to place upon  the Ministry of Health under the scheme, it may oven bo a quostion  whether the responsibility for working the scheme as a whole  should not also be placed upon the Ministry of Health.       I do not commit myself to this view at tho present moment,  but I am sure that the Cabinet will recognise that, the questions                                                         involved/
istry of Health.C, ADDISOK.   11.8.20,                    2.involved are so far reaching that adequate  time must begiven for their further consideration end I should  desiroto have the opportunity of submitting to  the Cabinet a detailed memorandum in regard to the who]e  question,     I may add that in my view tho question of the  maximumrato of compensation will need very close,examination in viewof its possible reaction upon other charges on public funds for the assistance of workmen during unemployment and sickness.
