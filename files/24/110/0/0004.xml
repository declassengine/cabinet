[ussoorie Conference.   Following telegram from Dobbs, No. 115 S., dated 25th      Yesterday was final meeting of Conference.   I began  by a formal restatement      r position regarding A rnaw a i, ending  with  following  sentence: &apos; We require  iat you will now by withdrawal of your troops from that place show that Afghanistanhonours her treaty obligations.&apos;   Aide-memoire was  then  read out, and I made shortspeech, pointing out object  of  our Conference, namely, removing misunderstandingand clearing way for subsequent negotiation of treaty of friendship had been fulfilled.We had learnt to understand their views  better, and they had, 1 believed, learnt to appreciate  reasonableness of our views and understood  why we  should regard asunfriendly and hostile acts on the part  of Afghanistan, encouragement of intriguesagainst British Government, &amp;c.   As final  word of advice I hoped they would be ableto convince leaders of Afghan people how mistaken is the idea held in some quartersthat British Government can  be influenced  by blustering or threats.   I then brieflyreviewed in terms of moderate optimism facts  of  external - situation, and ended  withcomplimentary allusion to  personnel of mission and  expression of  hope that we may-soon  have  the opportunity of welcoming  some, at all events,  of  present delegatesagain for the purpose of final negotiations of treaty of firm  and enduring friendshipbetween the two States.     &quot;Tarsi replied that he understood I do  not desire arguments at our last officialmeeting, and he would reserve his remarks on matters on  which Afghan views do notcoincide with ours.   Afghanistan at present considers the  firm friendship with Britishnecessary and useful.  Britain also considers Afghan friendship advantageous.  Therewas, therefore, good  hopes of success.  But  he  was  despondent on  many points and hoped that when Afghan  delegates returned, for  detailed discussion they would beallowed to reopen many points.   He concluded with complimentary phrases.  I repliedit was true that we had not had the final discussion of terms of  the treaty, but aide-memoire represented conclusions  reached  (?up to the present), and considered theviews of  my Government which, are set  forth at greater length  in  official records ofour conversations.  I then declared Conference closed.  Afghans leave 27th July.&quot;
