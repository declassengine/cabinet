                CAB Bra        Sale of  Australasian Lieat,        Report by the Jtjjdod Controller.(Reference Cabinet 25 (20) Conclusion 6  (e)  ),wmmmmmmmm     My last report on.the sale of Australasian meat by myDepartment was dated 1st July  (C.P.1559)[1]  STOCKSo   The stock position as at 30th June is shown onthe a&quot; TacEed schedule.   The contract for purchases in New Zealandterminated on 30&apos;th June,and the figures relating to the Dominionare therefore final.  It has been agreed that the contract for purchases in Queensland shall terminate on 30th November, 1920;but agreement as to a definite date fftr termination has not yetbeen reached with the other Australian Statesy    Owing to a severe drought, sanction has/been asked by and granted to the Commonwealth Government to utilize stocks of meatin the stores for local consumption^ The meat so used will betaken over at prices wiiitjh will cover the cost to the ImperialGovernmentc ;                             -                               *    New Zealand stocks as shown will be reduced by the shipmentsstill to be made to North America*(2)   CONSUMPTION,Sales of Imported Moat for consumption.Week ended	Total sales Tonsr -	Australasian Beef^Mutton &amp; Lambo Tons	American tons 	Australasian Mutton &amp; Lamb rmlyi Tons.d&quot; .

The&quot; sales show a decline from the exceptionally high&apos;levelreached in-Juno, as anticipated in my last reports  The decline&apos;is to be attributed to the increased home supplies which..&apos;  came to market on the termination of control,and to the more abundantsupply of beef which arrived from South Americar   The sales ofAustralasian moat during the thirteen weeks which ended..on  3rd Julyreached the high total of 121,414.tons; but this-covers a period when the- consumption of imported moat is&apos; usually at its highest level.      It is hoped to maintain the present rate of consumption untilthe middle . of Sept ember,,   but the general tone of tha-market is not....encouraging.  The agents are finding great difficulty in makingsales at the present schedule of prices, but at the same time arenot confident that any further reduction in price would increasethe output..  Business is further hampered by&apos;Jhe quantity of meat  -in unsatisfactory condition which has to be realised, at the  bestprice which can be .raade, and this meat tends to weaken the  value&apos;  .of the sound carcases.  It is customary for trade to be dull at this&apos;time of year, but the dullness seems, to be somewhat accentuated atpresent,  in view of the fact that a further diminution in  the ,consumption must be looked for in the autumn when the home  product!^.will be at its maximum, it may be necessary to consider at    ---esYTydate what steps should be^talccn to stimulate- the output.....,,  -^ywwmevzxm...... V.. ........ .
    It was found  necessary  to make a further reduction in theprice for. cut Ewes, in order to create a demand for these, and a flat price of 6d. per lb. for both Australian and New &amp;ealand. GirtEwes was announced on 5th July*  The reduction is having the desired effect,(5)  RENDERINO^DOWN MgTTON4  A suggestion was wade that some ofthe sTocH^Tn ^ew&quot;ZeaiaS3 might be more profitably dealt with by cutting off the prime joints     and boiling down the remainder of the carcase Into tallow.  It was proposed that the stocks  ofcut owes should be dealt with in this way, the legs and shouldersbeing shipped to this country^:  Provided the price anticipatedcould be obtained for the parts boiled down, the financial result would be more satisfactory, and there would be a great economyeffected in refrigerated tonnage and storage space, The proposal has been put up to the Government&quot; of New Zealand, and. their advice is now awaited,(4). DAMAGED STOCKS IN NEW 2EALA3SP;   It has been reported that stocks in certain 1 stores1 inITew Zealand  had becdraa seriously damaged, ^steps have been taken to despatch two inspectors from australia to Investigate the causes of the damage and to report as to liability for the loss sustained.(5)  CONTINENTAL BALES.  Little progress has been made in,thedirection ofetfeeling any actual sales to Continental countries,but the fact that Oermanyi. as a result of the decisions at theSpa Conference, will have considerable credits available forfoodstuffs should render possible sales to her in the oourseof a.month or two,  ...                           . ..(6) STORAGE &amp; SKIPPING POSITION.  The desultory trade during thepast.^wo or three weeks andthe Increase in the arrivals of beef from South America have tended to make the position less favourable^  The.arrivals which/ are expected within the courseof the next month or  six weeks are likely to create a positionof some difficulty as the quantities afloat, are much, in, excessof the accommodation which is at present available., Thesituation is being eased by the diversion of some-vessels from london to provincial ports,where there is more storage spaceavailable,, but the generaj cargo carried by&apos;these vesselsfrequently proves an obstacle in the Way of the diversion ofboats from London, .-&apos;(7) FINANCIAL STATEMENT,  A financial statement showing theestimate(T&quot;liquiclation account of the meat supplies which havebeen transferred from the Board of Trade, together with covering memorandum on the financial statement, are attached here to. &apos;      -        &apos;&quot;&apos;;: % &apos;  :    &apos; &quot; r&apos; : &apos;s &apos;(Signed)CHARLES - A, McCURDY.

             -12?gist July, 1920,FINANCE.  A Financial Statement is submitted herewith shewing the estimated  result of the Liquidation Account for Frozen Meat Supplies for theIf Year ended 31st March, 1921.  (1).  The total quantity  of meat to be taken over and sold has been  carefully examined,, and it is believed that the figures shewn will  not be exceeded subject to the Australian contracts being determined  as at September 30th next., with the exception of  Queensland^ which  will continue up to 30th November.  The figures for New Zealand are  final the contract having terminated as at 30 June 1920,  (2).  The sales have been calculated at the present selling prices as  it is not anticipated any further reduction will be necessary with  respect to the major portion of the supplies,&apos;  (3).  Due allowances have been ,made In the account to meet the  anticipated losses due to shrinkage, condemned meat and reduced prices  for  inferior meat,  (4)  Allowance has also been made for the estimated increased freights  which will have to be met,   (5). It will be observed that an item  of  500,00 0 has  been reserved to  meet possible  losses  in connection  with meat  stored for a long period in  newly constructed cold storage  accommodation in New Zealand,  As  it is  probable  that  a proportion of this  anticipated loss should be borne by  the  sellers, arrangements have been made to  send two independent   Inspectors  from Australia to New Zealand for the purpose  of  examining   stocks  and  reporting fully  as to the  extent  and cause  of  the  damage.        It will be  seen that  the loss  shewn on  the account  amounts  to    5,003,693,  16, 8?,  against which  there  is an estimated  accumulated   profit  on trading  from Inception to the  31st March,&apos; 1920,  amounting  to   J6,503,693,  16,8*,   leaving a  credit balance  amounting  to   1,500,000  (to meet  possible  further  losses  at present unforeseen^    Should such   losses  exceed this  latter figure-  there  still remains  an accumulated   credit  balance on Moat  inskip&apos;.rance  Reserve Fund A/c,, which should prrtve  more   than sufficient  to  enable the transactions to be closed without  loss.T-T&quot;.    -r-^- -77. - . &apos;  * &quot;           .
