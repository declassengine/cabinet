II.  GENERAL  INTELLIGENCE.AFGHANISTAN.         The Mussoorie Conference is now ended.   The Afghandelegates will &quot;be given detailed accounts of the actualconversations for the A dr s information, together with a written statement setting forth basis on which a treaty of friendship&apos;may be concluded.                   0 A N AD A.         At the Canada-West Indies trade Conference tentativeaj^reements, it is understood, have been,reached for a wideextension of trade, including        (1)  Increased preferential tariffs between canada and the British West Indies.        (2)  Increased steamship service between Canadian and west Indian port s, both by private and Canadian government services.        (3)  Increased cable facilities.                   PERSIA.         The general situation is unsatisfactory.  The british military Attache telegraphing from Teheran on 28th July considersthat the time has come either to reinforce the North PersianForce and take energetic action against the rebels in Gilan, orto withdraw&apos;, in his opinion the latter course would involvethe resignation of the Government, flight of the Shah, andthe establishment of anarchy and Soviet regime in the capital.A later report states that the revolutionary Kuchik &quot;Khan islosing influence locally and that the revolutionary outbreakis dying down.                   MESOPOTAMIA.         Arab attacks on the railway between Hillah and Kiflare reported, and there are strong indications of the dis-affection  spreading northwards.                   F I N L A N D         Peace negotiations with Soviet Government v^ere resumedat Dorpat on July 28th.  Finnish Government ask that H.M.Government should point out to the Soviet Government that further negotiations are superfluous in view of proposedLondon Conference, and invite the Bolsheviks to suspend them.         The first meeting of the Commission of three Juriststo consider the legal aspects of the Aaland Islands question will take place at&quot; Paris on August 3rd.                  &apos; soviet  RUSSIA.         The 2nd Congress of the Third International is takingplace at Moscow.  Bolshevik.W/T continues to paint alluringpictures of the general rejoicings and festivities.  The
attitude of the British I.L.P. towards the incitement to civil war reoently wired by Third International to the InternationalPress, points to there not being such complete harmony as isstated to exist.  Considerable harm is being done by reportsof alleged British sympathy With the Soviet regime by suchpapers as the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;Manchester Guard! sn11, etc         The latent political power of Germany in &quot;Russia isreports1 to be  strong.         , Tlae municipal conditions of Pstrograd are reported tobe appalling and the expected progress in reconstruction duringsurrfeier months has not matured.  Executions have increased inspite of Soviet declaration of abolition of death penalty.         Transport reorganisation is practically at a standstill.         A further exchange ofinotes has taken place between lord curzon and M. chicherin, regarding the resumption of trade, the upshot being     (a)  Soviet accept the offer of Poles for an armistice.     (b)  British and Russian Nationals held as hostages will       be exchanged.     (c)  Soviet disclaim responsibility of Azerbaijan Government       in imprisoning British Nationals at Balm but will bring       pressure to bear that they may be released or return via       Moscow.     (d)  A conference between Soviet delegation - invested with       plenipotentiary powers - and Allied representatives to be       held in London for -the purpose of establishing a definite       agreement between Russia and her enemies.     (e)  Resumption of Trade negotiations and no restrictions as       to nomination of Soviet representatives subject to       guarantees that these will&quot;not interfere in politics and       internal affairs.     (f)  H.M.Govt. informs General V/rangel of Soviet terms for       his surrender but repudiates being in any way connected with       the control of his actions.         The Soviet Trade delegates   MM. Kameneff and Miliutin -arrived  at Harwich on board H.M.S. &quot;SHAKESPEARE&quot; on July 31st.M. Krassin is arriving via Newcastle  Further evidence hasbeen  received of the keen trading rivalry which is commencingin the Baltic amongst British and Allied Powers.                        BALTIC         Esthonia.    The Esbhonian Government have expressed theirwish to attend the proposed Conference in London.         Lithuania.  It is reported that relations with theBolsheviks are once more.becoming strained owing to the failure &apos;of the latter to keep their promises in the dual occupation of .Vilna.   There has been some fighting&apos;between units.
                   BLACK  SEA.         Crimea.,  General Wrangel continues to carry out succesful/ minor operations and raids to consolidate hisposition on the Mariupol r Dnieper line.         Armenia.   Georgian Minister reports that Bolshevikshave refuseTTrO make -peace with Armenia.                 SIBERIA.         Moscow has communicated &quot;by W/T that the new RussianPar Eastern Republic which has been formed as a buffer stateEast of Baikal, - principally for the benefit of the Japanese -will,be absolutely free to conduct negotiations vrith foreign powers and to be in a position to fulfil any engagements withthe representatives of outside interests.  Japanese Governmenthave already recognised this Republic.                  POLAND,        The armistice with the Bolsheviks and reception ofparlementaires was arranged to take place on July 30th at Barno-witche.  TJp*T6&quot; date the Red Arm:/ continues its advance, the objective being Lemberg and possibly Warsaw-         The Polish delegates have instructions from their government : -                                  i                      i,    (1) Not to accept a frontier which is appreciably less favourable to Poland than the Spa Frontier.    (2) Not to agree to disarmament.    (3) Not to accept interference in internal affairs in poland in the direction of prescribing a form of Government.         It appears that the Soviet Military authoritiesintend to spin out the Armistice negotiations in order toimprove their military situation before the peace terms are put forwards         General Radcliffe, telegraphing on the 30th July,stated that in the North the Bolshevik cavalry was continuallyoutflanking the Polish left  plank.  There is no real improvementin the military situation although the rains are retarding theSoviet advance- and the assistance of the Allied Officers is re-awakening the moral of the Army,  The majority of the nationis determined to fight to the end.                    ITALY         A report that the. Albanians had captured Valona,with some 15,000 prisoners has been denied by the ItalianGovernment, who state that the Albanians have been repulsed.                   TURKEY.         The signature of the Turkish Peace Treaty has been delayed by Italo-Greek differences.-  Whereas the Turkishdelegation is prepared to sigh the Treaty9 M.Venizelos hasnow intimated that Greece cannot sigh until Italy has signi-fied her intention of-adhering to the Secret Italian-Greek
Agreement of 29th July, 1919, by which the islands of the dodecanese, vrere to be handed over by Italy (with the excep-tion of Rhodes) to Greece, in return for certain concessions in Asia Minor.   Hiodes by this agreement was to be handed to greece if and when the latter country obtained Cyprus from great Britain.  The Italian Government now maintains that the concessions in Asia Minor were not forthcoming, and thereforerefuses to be bound by the agreement.         In the meantime the British Government has announcedits intention of refraining from signature of the Treaty untilthe Dodecanese question has been settled9 and will also decline,until a settlement has been arranged to  sign the TripartiteAgreement1 which fixes the spheres of interest of Great Britain,France and Italy in Asia Minor.         The Greek- operations in Thrace have been brought toa successful conclusion era the Greeks are now concentratedfor a resumption of operations in Asia Minor.

R 0 U M A. N I ki        Relations with Jugo-Slavia have greatly.improved andan entente with that country is one of the principal points in the policy of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs (M.Take Jones cu).                       SPA IN         The Industrial situation at Bilbao has improved.Proppects are better as regards the strike of quay labourers.                     BELGIUM.         The Belgian Government consider that there is little prospect of a direct settlement between the Belgian and dutch government on the question &quot;of the revision of the Treaty of1939 so long as the latter maintain any claim of sovereigxityover the Wielingen Channel.  France is in favour of the pre-sentation of a Joint Anglo-French note to the netherlands government expressing their surprise at the action of the Dutdiin putting forward unprecedented claims.         Under tne terms of the Treaty of Versailles the dis-tricts of Eupon and Malmedy passed to Belgian sovereignty asfrom  24th July.
                    SY R I A,  \\         The French entered Daiaascus on 25th July after severefighting the previous day with  Sheriffian troops.   A new government was promptly formed  wrhich accepted all the condi-tions offered by the French.  Th^se included an indemnity often million francs, immediate general disarmament and the conversion of the army into a police forco.  Emir Feisalpersonally took no part in the fighting and appears to havefled after the engagement.

Ihe Anfu party have been defeated, and the Chili party^are now complete masters of the situation.   They demand the dissolution of the Frontier Defence Force,  dissolution ofParliament (at present packed with An fu adherents) and the punishment of their chief opponents.  The gates of Pekingare closed to the defeated soldiery.  The Chili troops havenot yet entered the city.                    japan N.         The health of the Emperor, continues to cause anxietyand he is compelled to abstain from formal ceremonies.         Tliat anti-Japanese feeling is strong in Singaporeis shown by the fact that when the Japanese cruiser &quot;Nisshinnw.docked there recently, difficulty was experienced in getting theChinese dockhands to work.  The Japanese&quot;admiral has&quot; now askedpermission to dock there the ligbt cruiser &quot;Tone&quot;, cruisingin company with &quot;Nisslain&quot;.  The Japanese Government have beenasked to withdraw this request.
