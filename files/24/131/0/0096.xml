[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January .1922.SECRET.CP.-3594.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY  OF THE STATE  OE  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 2nd instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.The observance of the Truce by Sinn Fein during the past week has again been satisfactory, and the number of breaches to be reported are few. Thus the awkward and dangerous period during which the enemies of settlement might have been expected to put forth their maximum effort comes to an end without serious damage to the prospects of peace.Two offences against the Police have to be recorded. At Laffansbridge, Co. Tipperary, a wireless operator of the R.I.C. was seized by I.R.A. men. but the Liaison Officer was promptly informed, and the man was released two days later. A more serious incident occurred at Macroom, Co. Cork, where an R.I.C. motor car was seized by armed men, while the District Inspector, who had been travelling in it, was calling at another officers residence. The Constable-driver was blindfolded and driven away, but was subsequently released, after being told that if he had been armed he would have been shot. It is reported that threats were also made against the District Inspector and his brother.Other outrages by armed men occurred at Minish, Co. Kerry, where a goods train was held up and some military stores taken, and at Ballyhannen. Co. Clare, where a house occupied by a woman was raided and some arms and ammunition seized.There were three cases of illegal arrest, followed in one case by release. One of the victims is rumoured to have been deported,.and the other is believed to be still detained.Ordinary Crime.Several further cases of robbery are reported, the victims in two cases being-postmen, who were held up by armed disguised men and robbed of cash, money orders and registered&apos; letters. These outrages occurred in Co. Carlow and Co. Cavan respectively. In Co. Carlow one of the armed gangs referred to in my last report lias been operating somewhat actively, but during a raid on a public house one member was arrested by the police and the remainder identified. Another arrest in connection with this outrage has since been made by the Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, who, I am glad to say, is working energetically with the police in their efforts to make further arrests. It is worthy of note that the Liaison Officer is taking up all arms in the possession of the I.R.A. in the locality from which this gang originatesTrials of Civilians by Court-Martial.No Court-Martial results were promulgated during the week. &apos;  &apos;&quot; [7o971

They have persuaded the Directors of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company to postpone the application of the Carrigan Award until the 15th January, and to recommend the other railway companies to take a similar course. Meanwhile, a conference &quot; representative of all the interests involved &quot; has been arranged to take place on the 6th January under the chairmanship of &quot; a Minister of the Dail Cabinet.&quot;Present Political Situation in Irelanu.The consideration of the Settlement Terms by Dail Eireann could scarcely have been resumed in an atmosphere more favourable to the ratification of the Treaty and the happy inauguration of the new regime. Though no sensational conversion of the more truculent Members is to be anticipated, these individuals will at least be under no false impression as to the feeling of their constituents, and the fervent desires of the people of Southern Ireland generally. One hundred and one Statutory Bodies have now demanded ratification, and to these may be added the Chambers of Commerce of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and nine similar bodies. The Farmers&apos; Associations, too, have come out boldly on the side of settlement, but most significant of all is the fact that twenty-five of the Sinn Fein Local Executives have also demanded ratification. The only dissentient voices against this overwhelming chorus of &quot; Yeas &quot; are those of the Bantry and Caherciveen Boards of Guardians. It is evident that the Prime M!inister&apos;s message, which appeared in the Irish press on the 29th December, had a very salutary influence upon the numerous meetings held throughout the country on that day and subsequently.   The effect of Sir James
Craig&apos;s New Year message to his followers, urging them to strain every nerve for an honourable and enduring peace, has also been good, and its reception by the Dublin press was eloquently pacific and extremely cordial.H. gr.Irish Of/ice, Old Queen Street, S.W.1, January 5, 1922.Statement showing Total Number of Serious Outrages from January 1, 1.919, to november .19, 1921.Weekly Totals to Week ended December 31, 1921, and Totals at that date.

The above particulars do not include outrages of a kind which are not now being committed. e.g., 119 raids on revenue offices, which occurred during the months of April and May 1920, and resulted in the destruction of many official documents and much other public property.

The above table does not. include outrages committed in Northern Ireland since the 22nd November, 1921, the date on which Executive Authority was transferred by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Government of Northern Ireland.O
