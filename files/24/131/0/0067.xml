[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SEC 1.1 ET.CP. 3566.THE CABINET.FOREIGN INCITEMENT OF THE TURKS TO ATTACK IRAQ. (Circulated by the Secretary of State eor the Colonies.)IN a recent telegram, circulated to the Cabinet as OP. 3511 (Secret), the High Commissioner for Iraq gives in some detail the reasons which have led him, the G.O.C. and King Feisal to conclude that the Turks are hostile to Iraq and are prepared to break out into open hostilities whenever a favourable opportunity presents itself. Evidence resting on the High Commissioner&apos;s personal knowledge shows that strong-pro-Turkish and anti-Feisal propaganda is being carried out in Iraq, and there has already been an armed incursion of Turks on a small scale into the mandated area, as a result of which Rowanduz (a Kurdish town, but situated south of the Mesopotamian frontier laid down in the Treaty of Sevres) is now in Turkish hands.Unfortunately, evidence from other quarters shows that the High Commissioners fears are only too well-founded. It is not surprising that the Turks should want to recover at least Mosul, for.that would 1. Enhance their prestige throughout the Moslem world ;2. Give them the means of holding Southern Kurdistan, as well as a base for operations against Baghdad later on ; 3. Recover for Turkey a valuable oil-bearing area, which would bring them, from french or American sources, funds of which they are in great need.What is rather surprising, however, is to learn, as we have learned on good authority, that the French have at least contemplated &quot;facilitating the plans of the Turks by giving them arms and ammunition, and promising them full diplomatic support against the Greeks. It is known for certain that the French have been negotiating with the Turks about economic concessions in Turkey, and there is some evidence that the Turkish pledges include references to Iraq, and even a promise that the Turks will do their best to oust Feisal from that centre. It is stated that the Turks have promised to give the French, if they recover Iraq, priority rights in the oil aud the concession for the Baghdad Railway. But that is not the only bait which attracts the French. They want to hold Syria, but to hold it without great expenditure, and at the same time without making concessions to Arab aspirations, which in Syria are strong. St) long as Iraq, which is fifty years behind Syria in education and civilisation, has a more advanced form of government than Syria, the French must hold Syria down by main force; but if the Turks returned to Iraq the French administration in Syria might appear relatively liberal and pro-Arab, and, moreover, the French would be rid of Feisal, whom they regard as still hankering after a throne in Damascus.It is nut only the French whom there is some reason to regard as not unfavourable to a Turkish attempt at the reconquest of Iraq. There is reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company are not only striving to secure a share in Iraq oil by open means, but are inciting the Turks to attack Iraq in the hope of obtaining from them a share in the oil which they are unable to get so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government remain in control of the oil area and continue to support the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s claim to a pre-war concession of the oil rights in the Baghdad and Mosul vilayets. It is believed that the Standard Oil Company gave encouragement perhaps even pecuniary encouragement-to the extremists during the troubles in Iraq in 1920 ; and it looks as though, having failed to get the expected profit out of the Arab [7507]
Government, they were now backing the Turks, coniident that the latter, if they recovered control in Iraq, would declare invalid the Grand Vizier&apos;s promise, which is the basis of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s claim. It is not known how far the United States Government are aware of the Standard Oil negotiations with Angora, but their attitude regarding &quot; A &quot; mandates generally, the North Persia oil concessions, railway enterprise in Persia, &amp;c, leads to the, belief that they would not regret the return of the Turks to Iraq if it gave United States oil interests a hold in the Iraq oil-fields.If there were no economic advantage to be gained the Turks might be content to leave Iraq alone, but it would not be surprising if, with millions of francs or dollars before them as a prize, they made a serious attempt to recover Northern Iraq from His majesty&apos;s Government, and from the Arab Government which is based on the assumption that the Turks will make no such attempt.M.E.
