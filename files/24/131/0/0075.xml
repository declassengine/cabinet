THIS DOOTOEOT JCg THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMEMT.GAB I M E T *WORKS FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.. L..CK59 cMEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.li     When the scheme was first adopted of giving grants towards capital expenditure incurred by Local Authorities for. works put in hand by them in order to provide employment, no       .. limit as to the liability of the Exchequer was fixed,     The question, however, came up at a meeting of the Cabinet Unemploy-ment Committee on the 16th September;    and it was then arranged      i that schemes of work to a capital value of  10,000,000 could be approved for grant, and that this limit should not be exceeded without further consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer     The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not present at this meeting of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee, but the Treasury was represented and no objection was raised,The reference to this matter in the official report of the Committee meeting is as follows (C.U.28. Conclusions 5(3).).:** &quot;Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of  10,000,000 without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;,It Is manifest, therefore, that there was no under-standing at all that the limit of  10,000,000 was to be final;&apos; on the contrary, definite provision was made for further consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the figure of  10,000,000 was found not to be adequate.     I certainly did not for one moment take the figure to be anything but provisional and subject to reconsideration in the light of the schemesEGRET vp.3574.
submitted by Local. Autiaor-iti.es and of ther -dtrvelopmerrta  ls regards unemployment.     I would r-emlnd my solloagues that, at that time, what we feared was not that Local Authorities would submit a plethora of schemes, but that sufficient works would not be put in hande      In fact at the beginning, schemes were submitted but slowly, and there was acute controversy both as to the rate of grants and as to the condition that not more than. 76% of the ordinary rate of wages should be paid to unskilled men;   this is the reason why it is only recently that schemes have been approved in large numbers, and that the full effect of the schemes in providing employment is only now beginning to be felt.2.     The position to--day as regards schemes which have been strtmrltted for grant is understood to be briefly as follows?&quot; 1620 schemes have been submitted of a capital value of 16,000,000;    of these schemes, 729 schemes have been approved of a capital value of 7,900,000, 276 schemes (of &apos;a capital value of 1,500.,000) have been rejected for Unemployment Grant,including a number of schemes which have been passed tothe Ministry of Transport and in recpeot of which RoadGrants have been made by that Department, The Unemployment Grants Committee have before thorn now forconsideration, 615 schemes of a capital value of  6,500,000. In accordance with the wishes cf the Government, measures have been taken to stimulate Local Authorities in areas where there is grave distress to submit schemes of employment;   a considerable amount of diplomacy has had to be exercised in some oases to surmount the objections, especially of Labour Council, to the rates of grant and the condition as to wages.     As already mentioned, It la only latterly that the
effect of this stimulation has become most manifest.Likewise in accordance with the wishes of the Government, every possible measure has been taken to expedite the consideration and approval of schemes.     Devices have been adopted so as to enable Local Authorities to start schemes as quickly as possible)   for instance, in the case of some large schemes which require investigation on the spot, a general approval has been given, where warranted, to the scheme as a whole, with a specific approval and loan sanction to particular-parts which were straightforward, In order that the Local Authority might at ones put men to work, the sanction to the remainder being deferred until the necessary local investigation and amendments of the scheme had been made.     In this and other ways, my Department are committed to at least a further  500,000 over and above the  7,900,000 definitely approved.3.     As is well known to my colleagues, unemployment is still acute j   the last figure tff persons unemployed according to the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 2nd December is1,834,000 of whom 1,415,000 were men.     The situation In many parts of the country continues to be dangerous,&apos; and is likely to be so for some months yet.     Well as Local Authorities have responded latterly In the submission of schemes, it has been felt by some persons that still more was required, and the Unemployment Committee quite recently resolved unanimously that the Prime Minister should be requested to issue a special letter to Local Authorities urging them to submit further schemes without delay.It has to be borne in mind also that a number of Local Authorities, including some with Labour Councils
in areas whs re unemployment is acute and explosive, have been laggard in submitting schemes because of the labour objections to some of the terms of the grant. Action to get over the objections has been taken and is being taken with good prospect of success.      It might be s&amp;icl that it is the fault of such authorities if they no&apos;.f find that their schemes are not passed, and that they should have submitted them earlier;    but this would be a sorry reason, and could, in fact, not be maintained if the. local situation became gravely dangerous.4.     It seems to be  incontrovertible that now to turn down ruthlessly hundreds of schemes of Local authorities in areas where the unemployment is of a grave character would serve but to infuriate the element inclined to violent action and would play into the hands of extremists.     At no time so far as I am aware has the Government made   any public announce merit at all of the limit of the capital value of the works which they are prepared to pass for grant;    the limit of  10,000,000 was deliberately treated as confidential, and, as I have shewn, was expressly provisional in character.The Government have urged Local authorities to put forward their proposals;   now to refuse to consider these proposals because they are in excess of a liiv.it of which the Local authorities have never heard, will be regarded by them as an intolerable breach of faith and may, I fear, in some cases dangerously relax the all Important efforts made by the Local Authorities to keep in peaceful channels the disaffection aroused by unemployment, a result which may be disastrous to the well being of the country.      I need scarcely point out that a few grave disorders in some of the large towns would quickly cost the Exchequer many hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The schemes submitted by Local Authorities have, fa- the most part, been of a decidedly useful character, being either for schemes required for the health of the corranunity or for schemes of reproductive work.     It is also an express condition of approval of schemes that the authority would not have undertaken them at present except to relieve unemployment and relying on the Government contribution as against the excess present cost. I am unable to give a complete analysis corresponding to the total figures quoted in paragraph 2. above, but of the schemes actually passed for grant up to the 8th of December only a little over  250,000 was for such amenities as parks and pleasure grounds (though, as regards this class of work, it has to be remembered that it has the special advantage that most of the money is spent directly on labour, and very little goes towards buying material).(1) Schemes approved by the Unemployment Grants Committee up tot he 8th De ce mbe r;A.

Detailed and lengthy investigation would be necessary to ascertain exactly the amount of labour whites h will be employed
on the schemes which have been passed and may be passed later; but, from calculations which have been made, it is estimated that on the average the expenditure of  1,000,000 on these capital works will give employment equivalent to that of 80,000 men for one month or 20-000 men for four months.     Of this total employment about one-half will be thet of men employed directly on the works themeolvea, the other half being that of men employed in the getting or making of materials required for the works   we are apt to think only of the direct labour employed in these schemes;   but to my mind the labour indirectly employed is even more Important because it helps to stimulate the ordinary flow of industry and to revive confidence.7,     An important consideration to be borne in mind in connexion with tho.present scheme of grants is the manner in whic*... the charge on the national funds is eased for the Exchequer.,     The Exchequer provides a contribution towards the annual payment which has to be made by the local Authorities in respect of the loans raised to carry out works *     There will not be any charge on the Exchequer In respect of the current financial year cProm calculations which have been made fct is estimated that, In respect of every  1,000,000 of capital expenditure approved for grant, the Treasury will have to pay  45,COO for the first five years,  39,000 for the next five years and  32,000 for the last five years. The present capitalised value of this grant is about  370,000;   but what is,- of course, oxoeedingly Important from the point of view of the Exchequer Is that the burden on the national funds is spread over a period, of 15 years, during which the country will have the full benefit of
the return of prosperity.Applying these figures to the statistics already given as to the amount of employment which Is afforded by the items it will be found that the present capitalised cost to the Exchequer of providing cne man with one month&apos;s work is under  5, the actual payments to be made by the Treasury being spread over 15 years and being at the rate of about 11/5 for the first five years. 9/8 for the next five years and 0/- for the third five years.8o     Fortunately there is for the moment a quieter trend of feeling among the unemployed    but I am convinced that any one who thinks that the danger is past and that there doss not still exist a large amount of highly dangerous material, quick to explode under provocation, is deceived. I feel quite sure that none of my colleagues will dissent from this statement.One of the principal reasons why there is for the moment a better state of mind among the unemployed is. the def5nite evidence up and down the country that the Government have seriously tried to do what they can to deal with unemployment0 There has to the general public been no manifest result from the exporv-credit or the guarantee schemes,     Apart from Unemployment Insuranoe and assistance to dependents, the one and only measure adopted by the Government which has any results manifest to the man in the street, is that of stimulating Local Authorities by grants to undertake works of public utility.Obviously we want to do all we possibly can to reduce the burden of taxationa     None knows that better than I do* But for the Government on the one hand to refrain from relieving admittedly acute unemployment for the sake of saving a few hundred thousand pounds a year and at the same time to
reduce taxation on the more. w^ll-to-do classes would be to put the most effeotive weapon that could possibly be forged into the hands of those who are only too anxiously watching for an opportunity to disturb the present social peace.A. MONO. 21at December, 1921,
