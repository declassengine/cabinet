Krassin and certain Bi-itish Labour leaders on November 29th.Edgar Whitehead has sent an interesting account of the recent Berlin conference of the Russian Famine Relief Committees.The International Socialist Club is alosing down and it ia reported that the National Administrative Council of Unemployed will establish new headquarters at the Brotherhood Church, Southgate Road, N.The/
The financial difficulties of the Communist Party appear to he increasing and its paper has been reduced f 12 *to 8 pages.It is reported that the labour Party is negotiating the&apos; directors of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; with a view to tatein over that paper.
THE unemployed on December 2nd the wholly unemployed on the live registers numbered approximately 1,035,200,an increase of 2,015 on the previous week:   registered short time workers numbered 265,500 on November 25th, an increase of 15,500 on the previous week.On December 8th the special     emergency conference convened by the General Council of the Trades Union&apos; Congress and the National Executive of the Labour Party, -to consider the question of unemployment and theinternational situation, was held in the Memorial Hall and was attended by about 100 delegates.     R.B. Walker, president of the General Counoil, was in the chair.   A very long&apos; resolution re-affirmed demands which are:- familiar and&apos; which have bean reported in the Press. Contingents of unemployed totalling about 500 marched ; -&apos;from Battersea, Benaondsey, Bethnal Green, Clapham, Bast Ham, Pinsbury, Islington, Lambeth, Paddington, St. Pancras Shcreditoh and Southwark and a deputation headed by- Hannington was-received by the conference.     Haye and lire. Tbring expressed their&apos; opinion of the gathering of trade unionists with some oandour but the contingents subsequently reformed and marched home without any disorder having oeourred.     Unemployed leaders&apos; subsequently reprimanded their followers, who they said liad turned out for the demonstration in twenties instead of thousands.Disgust with the apathy of the unemployed, is being-expressed by several Metropolitan agitators but the London District Counoil is nevertheless considering the possibility of holding demonstrations in the ?/est Endduring/
during Christmas waek: a Clapham speaker recently adyis his audience to &quot;make themselves an intolerable nuisance order to attract attention.Organised unemployed from Vfoolwioh, Sltham and Cray and a few from the Bexley district imprisoned the member, of the Bexley Urban District Council in the CouncilChamber throughout the night of December 7th - 8th,     IniIthe early morning the Councillors agreed to a deputation!:;!igoing to the Unemployed Grants Committee to attempt to    Iobtain an authorisation to pay trade union rates of wageiIand further promised that as Individuals they would vote against proceeding with any scheme for which these ratasIwere not paid.     It is reported that during the night th unemployed took vossession of the clerk&apos;s offices,decorating the electric lamps with red tape and placardi) \&quot;       &apos; mthe walls with written revolutionary posters.There are signs that disssnsion among membors ofv..    . , &apos; &apos; - Bcommittees is splitting the organised movement in variou parts of the Metropolis. and the genuine unemployed shows disinclination to associate themselves with the. mt IIrevolutionary elements.Reports from the provinces indicate growing restlessness among the unemployed and my Midlands and Lancashire correspondents say that the condition of some the unemployed is approaching destitution.     The estremi appear to be gaining ground in Coventry where there iB increasing support for the demands of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed.     The situation in Leicester has beoome more serious since the arrival in ti$ city of Wakefield, the organiser for the Central Area: December 4th Wakefield addressed two large meetings in tf! Market Place and enrolled 50. new members for the unemployment; organisation;    he and Hobert Harvey of Birmingham headedl
a deputation to the local Guardians on Deoember 6th when there was some liveliness^&quot; The situation in Nottingham is less serious than is the oase in other Midland towns owing to the absence of an unemployed committee:   there is uhrost among the unemployed in loughborough, where the -Guardians have reduced out-relief payments from 42/- to 24/6 per week. In Birmingham there is a alight decrease in the number of unemployed and great efforts are being made to raise money for the relief of hardship..   The Wolverhampton Police have raised over  200&apos; by a boxing tournament and boots for the children of unemployed will be bought with this money.   Smethwiok. unemployed are not shov/ing muoh Interest in out-door meetings.   On December 12th a large body of unemployed assembled at the West bromwich Workhouse to protest against their alleged bad treatment by the Rev, J. Scarlett, ohairman of the Assistance Committee: they subsequently attempted to march, to the chairman^ home, but were stopped by the Police,No improvement is reported in tho situation in Lancashire and Cheshire, where unemployed demonstrations oontinue to be held.   Communists still retain thoir hold upon the organised unemployed in Liverpool and es:-?,C. Tissyman said on December 8th, &quot;I am sick to death of the lack of interest -which the authorities of Liverpool show to the unemployed:   if they do not wake up and do something we will commence our midnight prooessions again and the Police can go the Hell with their batons,&quot;On December llth a special service for the unemployed was held in All Saints&quot; Church, Oxford Road, Manchester:   some of. the congregation proved unruly and most of them sang the &quot;Red flag&quot; to the accompaniment of
a bugle instead, of the hymn &quot;When wilt thou save thy people?&quot;     The Bishop of Manchester was interrupted, during hie address and subsequently allowed quostions.My correspondont reports that unemployment remains acute in the chief Yorkshire towns:   there is not much organised agitation in Sheffield or Leeds but in Huddersfiei tho unemployed appear to be very discontented.Reports from South -teles indicate that the organisation!&apos; of the unemployed is still following constitutional lines.RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN GREAT BRITAIN   .&apos;a document of exceptional interest has been sent by Jules Humbert Drcz to the chairman of the Communist Party ofj Great Britain:   Droz is the leader of the Swiss Communist Party and has been present at most of the Moscow conference! he is a member of the Zomintern and recently entered Russia on a German passport.     The following is a translation of his communication, which constitutes another proof of Russian propaganda in this country;. &quot;Mosoow, November 21st, 1921&quot;To the Communist Party of Great Britain,London. &apos;    .&quot;We have reoeived your letter of October 12th and thank you for it.

The re-organisation of the secretariat here allows us to have much more regular and frequent connections with all the parties.

Before launching the idea of the boycott in the world proletariat we shall endeavour to interest the Amsterdam International in the matter,&quot;We remind you that we attach great Importance to the faot that the British Communist Party is undertaking systematic and regular propaganda in Hindu and Japanese oiroles in London.

See rotary&apos;b report (Munzenberg who had ^ust returned after two weeks at Moscow. , i The essence of this report as regards material    U help, was that practically no organisation but ourselves had really done anything.   The work of Nansen so far as results were concerned had not yet reached big proportions and up to the present he had exclusively fed children.   The ; Amsterdammers.(including the British Labour Party) hod indeed sent a commissioner and three secretaries but as they were not e.a table, no great good had so far resulted.   The ^imstardammers so far have done absolutely nothing. &quot;&apos;. r &apos; . &apos;&quot;following this report the separatee-countries gave their reports1 and then the&apos; steps for the furthering of*the work was considered;   This includes,&apos; .    .,  .. .--Great Christmas and New Year effort Help for the spring sowing Children&apos;s homesDelegations to different oountries.Pollovrf
"Following this the whole committee considered how it should act as the big conference fixed for the following day.

It was agreed to enter the conferenoe as a separate faction, to nominate only one person to the presidium (Zetkin) and to act throughout as a parliamentary unit at this conference. The aims to be achieved were considered in detail."

Whitehead&apos;s report continues:- 

Sunday. 4th December

"United conference in the Town Hall. About 200 delegates in all present, representing practically every known Famine Relief Organisation. Nansen was represented, the Amsterdammers were there, Fritz Adler (21/2 International) was there, and also the Quakers International Organisation (Fletcher an Englishman was there).

"The presidium was Zetkin (Auslands Committee) Grassmann,(Amsterdammers) Krasinszski (Russian Famine Cte.) Miss Marx (Clarté organisations)Coates (Hands off Russia Cte.)

"The conference lasted all day and was an unqualified success. The cheif sensation was the appearance of John Albert Coterill, who had just come from the volga (Quaker). He told in simple language what he had seen, how in this village 1/4 of the population was dying every month, and that corpses lay everywhere frozen in.

"Hundreds of thousands have already died. He told too of the fortitude and sacrifice of the Soviet, Officials, who worked till the end of their strength and then often sickened and died. The mortality among these Soviet Officials is as great as in any class.

"A Joint universal manifeste was agreed upon and will be drafted by the presidium to-day.

Monday 5th December

"Full days conferenoe of the Auslandscommittee and affiliated organisations.60 delegates present. I was ohairman of this conference throughout the day.

"All possible practical proposals were discussed at fullest length and all practical steps for the future agreed upon.

"Coates made some very practical propositions and these should have very excellent results. He will be back before me, and will be taking steps to form a national oommittee etc. No doubt he will be seeing you as soon as he gets back.

"From/
&quot;From cur own point of view tho conference was excellent.    Bo far as any single country got the bououeta it was ourselves and especially the Communist Party of Great p/ijtain.   We are the only oountry whioh has completely carried out the demands! of the Komintern in this cjuectipii.&quot;Inoidentally yeu might tell Tom Bell that we were desoribed in Sunday&apos;s conference, by one speaker as &quot;The laughably smell,Communist Party of Great Britain,&quot;     Notwithstanding of course we have oolleoted more &quot;per head&quot; than any other country. Still it is not very pleasant to hear remarks of this nature.   Everybody here enquires about the growth of the English party and when you oannot say it is more than 10,000 they tell you the organising department of the party must have the toothaohe..*&quot;The question of your passport is now hopeless, Both Roland Hoist, Friis, and yourself fend one or two other oomrades had an absolute bar against them at the last momenta&quot;Ore thing you oan well do before I, get back. Get publicity matter out for Christmas Gifts to be given to the Russian Famine Sufferers.     Statistics of what has been done and Coterills statistics abtut how people are dying will be given in a pist or two.&quot;The Berlin Committee has informed the Communist Party that it has now received from Russia a film entitled &quot;Hunger&quot;, whioh deals with scenes in the famine area and. that copies of this are being made:   the film is offered to the British Communist Party at the price *f 80,000 marks and will be ready for dispatch on Deoember 15th;   there is, as yet, no information as to whether the British Communist Party is prepared to pay the required sum or whether it could secure exhibition in this country.   It is worthy of note, however^ that the Berlin representative oonsiders that &quot;the film will not only quicken relief work but will also produce material results and be useful for general propaganda purposes.   Arrangements must of course be mads for exhibition of the whole film in all towns and villages.&quot;The /
The financial position of the Communist Party does not appear to have improved and &quot;The Communist&quot; has bo en  reduced from twelve to eight pages &quot;for an. unoertain period&quot; as &quot;the inkpln oase alone has oost more than  1,000.&quot;and &quot;Mr. Thomas&apos; libel action has given the ccup de^ grace,     we are forced to cut down drastioally and the reduction in the &apos;Communist is only one of the retrenchments whioh have to be made,&quot;The landlord of the Scottish Headquarters at 221,West George Street, Glasgow, appears to be pressing forarrears of rent and 3&apos;red Peet has informed RobertStewart that,&quot;Amongst the economies whioh it has been decided to adopt with a view to tiding us over the present financial oirsis Is one regarding the expenses of Divisional Organisation, and at the meeting &quot;of the sub-committee last Sunday, it was agreed that the Distriot Councils be informed that henceforth the Head Offioe-will-accept responsibility only for the salaries of the Distriot Organisers, and that all other Distriot Organising expenses must be met out of local &quot; funds,     A decision like this will, of oourse, have to be applied judioiously and not arbitratily, because in some oases District . Counoils have incurred expenditure largely on the recommendation of Headquarters,     There is for example the Scottish premises, and what with the rates and the rent, we shall have during this and next v/eek to pay out nearly  100, which I expect it would be ridiculous for us.to anticipate throwing upon the Distriot Counoil.     There is, however, the question of the  10&quot;sent you weekly, which we would like, if possible, to put a stop to, if it oan be undertaken by the District Council,   . We are sending the amount this week as usual, but I shall be glad-to hear from you as to whether you think it possible the payment of this amount oan be avoided in future.   The&apos; financial position is exceedingly critical, and unless we out down the expenditure to the lowest possible minimum, we shall run the risk of a oonrplete collapse within a few weeks,&quot;The Executive appears still to have some funds,however, for Peet has sent to Glasgow this week theusual salaries,  3 for J.3, Campbell,   and  11 for theweek&apos;3 organising expenses.On/
-  10 - VOn December 4th it was decided at a special general meeting of the International Socialist Club that owing to financial difficulties the Club would have to olosa down:   the Oommunist p..rty had intended to take over the Club but owing to the deficit, which is said to amoxxnt to  2,300, this idea has been abandoned.   By way of celebrating the passing of.-.the.....Club the contents of the last barrel of beer were distributed gratis by two members who were of opinion that the assets of the Club would not be seriously affeoted by their aotion.     On December 12th the electric light was cut off and bailiffs- are now in possession. Negotiations for the other premises are Said to be in progress.,It is stated in communist circles that as MaoManus, Howard and Meynoll have no money the National labour Press will have to pay Mre J0H, Thomas1 damages.On December 11th about 1,000 people attended a meeting held under the auspices of the Peokham branch of the Communist Party:     the speakers included -7, McLaine, Bert Joy, Hodgson and Vaughan, brother of the bolshevik Mayor of Bethnal Gresn;   the last named stated that the branch would prosecute its campaign with avidity in the Mew Year notwithstanding the fact that it had a balance of only 6d.     The cost of the meeting, inoluding advertising, amounted to  15:   the first collection realised about  8 and in spite of a retiring collection it is probable that the credit balanoe of the branch was wiped out.Reports from the provinces indicate that the soarcity of money at headquarters is affecting branches:Headquarters/
Hoadquarters have requested Coventry to pay back the sum ,of  150 \yhi,ch is the balance of the money advanced to pay the -expenses- of the action brought by the local -Independent Labour: Party in July last;   as only 6 of, the Coventry communists, are employed- the prospects of raising this money are not bright*&apos;  Tom Mngley, who is now ohairman of - the Coventry-Unemployed Committee, is trying to-link up the communists and the unemployed and Leonard J&amp;okson is very aotive: the latter addressed two meetings In the Market Square on December 11th:   9 dozen oopies of &quot;The Communist&quot;, 30 -copies of &quot;The Worker&quot; and pamphlets to the value of 13/6d* were sold.     These sales are more than double the usual, amount, and the -oommunists were pleased, with the collection,- The Birmingham Branch of,the Communist Party is short of money and It was &quot;stated at a recent meeting that-a compulsory levy of 6d. per week on employed and 3de per week on unemployed members would be ma.de:   at the same meeting an official stated that the national sales of &quot;The Communist&quot; had fallod from 45,000 to 30,000 a week, \ The&apos; Birmingham communists hold frequent meetings but these are on the whole poorly attended;    on December 11th only 26 people assembled to hear, Jack Leckie speak at the Red Hill Council Schools, Hay kill;    the small attendance in this case may, however, have been due to the fact that at the same time about 280 persons were present at a meeting held in floodgate Street Schools at which William Brain was the chief speaker,    Birmingham City Council has decided, by 63 votes to 19, to refuse to let the Town Hall to the looal communists.
John MaoLean1^ lieutenants are conducting a strenuous municipal campaign in the Springhurn Ward:   his election address whioh is headed &quot;Barlinnio Prison&quot; consists of a series of extravagant demands inoluding free meals for the unemployed, cheap meals for other citizens, municipal restaurants to feed striking and looked-out workers, municipal music halls and picture houses, no rent to he paid hy the unemployed and work or maintenance for the unemployed, &quot;the cost of the co-operation to be met by the Government unlesB where Corporation work is done.&quot;My Glasgow correspondent reports that about 6,500 signatures have been obtained for the petition t the Secretary for Scotland for the re-instatement of Bx-P.0. Magill who was dismissed from the Glasgow Police on account of his connection with Guy Aldred^ Communist Group-   It is alleged, however, that several revolutionary enthusiasts have signed more than once.Arthur Kott, of the Young Communist League, has been ordered by his doctor to give up his work for several months and-William Carroll, the general secretary, appears to have taken over.     The League is issuing a series of industrial leaflets:   W. Mclai is responsible for the one entitled &quot;To the Youth of the Engineering industry&quot;, which is plausibly written and might appeal to discontented apprentices.BRITISH/
*W* -285BRITISH. LABOUR LEADERS&apos; Uri&apos;.3kvib7 V/ITH M. kb AS SINThe &quot;Hands Off Russia&quot; Committee has drawn up apamphlet which purports to he an account of an interviewgiven to certain Labour leaders by M. Kra33in&apos;on November29th:   Messrs. Ben Turner, J.?., (Textile Workers),Alex Gossip (&quot;-Furnishing Trades), C.G. Amraon, J.P.,L.C.C, (Union of Post Office Workers), John Turner (shop assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks), d, Caraichael,(London Trades Council), Jack Mills, M.P., and Neil McLean,M.P., apparently put certain questions to the head oftho Russian Trade Delegation with a view to obtaining information for the unemployed conference on December 8th.Extremists will doubtless make use of this Interview for propaganda purposes:   some parts of the questionnaire asreproduced by tho Hands Off Russia Committee bearrepetition, numbers 5 and 6 being of special interest:&quot;Question 2.   What would be the effect of full and complete recognition of the Russian Republic by &quot;Western Europe on the rehabilitation of&quot;Russia?Answer 2.   Pull recognition of the Soviet Government by the principal States of Tea torn Europe, and in particular by those of the Entente, would le&amp;dt) a radical change...., as all tho countries bordering on Russia are in the first place influenced by the -     attitude maintained by Great Britain and Prancetowards her.,      A de Jure recognition of the Soviet Government would lead to the establishment of peace throughout Europe, and would be the starting point for an economic revival, not only in Russia but all over the world.&quot;Question 3. How, in your opinion, would recognition by Great Britain affect other European Governments?Answer 3.   The de jure recognition of the Soviet Government by Great Sri tain would be of paramount Importance in view of the loading position 3he holdB in the European Conoert of Powers,   Britain^ voice would be a decisive one, not only for&quot;Italy, vho may be considered more favourably inclined towards the full recognition of Soviet Russia than any other Power, out also for Prance, who is not in a position to maintain an Isolated policy, and, in her aggressive attitude evinced towards Russia, relies to a great extent on the hostility o  certain sections of British official opinion towards the Soviet Government The conclusion of a real peace between Great Britain and Russia would be the most important step towards the final abolition of all interventionist policies directed against Moscov&quot;,&apos;&quot;Question/
&quot;Question 4.   Assuming that normal relations were established between Russia and Great Britain and that you were asked to put forward a proposition, of immediate practical application, which would assist Russia in re-establishing her economic life&apos;, and at   $ the same time help in relieving unemployment in this country, what would be the main lines of your proposal!Answer 4.   Should normal political relations be resumed between Russia and Great Britain, the first task would be to elaborate, with British^assistance, a plan for the economic revival of Russia.   The Soviet Government would welcome any help from England, such as participation by experts and technicians in the drafting of concrete proposals.IThe main points in the economic restoration of Russia are as follows:(a) Assistance to agriculture, and in particular tothe peasantry.(b) Restoration of industry - and in the first placeindustry connected with the fuel production, that is, coal, naptha and wood.(c) Restoration of rail and water transport.(d) Restoration of the mining industry,in particularcopper, gold, platinum and silver mines.(e) The supply of food, clothing and articles of prime necessity to the population of Russia and in particular to the famine stricken provinces.&quot;Question 5.   Assuming that a loan, say of  100,000,G were suggested, -what guarantee do you think your government would give?. -   -Answer 5, - As regards the Question of guarantees whiol the Soviets.Government might&apos; offer In case of a loan, only general principles can now be laid down. This matter can be discussed in more detail only when some definite proposal for a loan has been made, touching [I its extent, period, conditions of issue, etc. The Soviet Government cannot offer any guarantees which are not compatible with the dignity of the Russian State, tend&quot;to diminish its sovereignity *or menace Its&apos; territorial integrity. The Soviet Government, faced with the present exhausted condition nf its country, cannot offer any immediate material guarantee in the shape of gold security or other pledged resourc It is, however, prepared to grant &quot;as security for such a loan, concessions for the exploitation of oil, mineral8 ores, forests, means of communication on certain conditions, and a3so to accord participation the increased profit yielded by various undertakings, and land3, as a result of improved methods of production and the equipment obtained from abroad.. Bonds of vfaolesale and consumers&apos; co-operative3 could f serve as additional security.&quot;Question 6.   If such a loan was concluded,, do you think it would he spent, or largely spent, on the purchase of saaaufactured goods in Great Britain?Answer/1
Answer 6.   Should a loan be granted, the Soviet Government would be able to make considerable purchases abroad and, other conditions being equal, would naturally and. willingly give preference to tho .market   of the country which participated in the raising of the loan.   The Soviet Administration, being tho government of a country now extremely exhausted, and poor, is compelled to observe the greatest possible economy in expenditure, and particularly in purchases requiring foreign currency in payment.   Therefore the Soviet Government cannot pay for articles and goods purchased, in one country at prices higher than those ruling in the world market.   But, I repeat, should, a loan be .offered, some understanding could be reached to the effect that part of the sum raised should be expended for purchase in the country granting the loan, provided that prices, dates of delivery and other conditions are not less favourable than those obtainable in other foreign markets.Kat Wat kins ha 3 informed Ian MePherson, whoseremarks regarding the Press propaganda of the british bureau were given in last week,s report, that:&quot;It is necessary to understand that the Press of Great Britain are not lending the oblumns of their reactionary papers to spread revolutionary idens, but are strenuously working to suppress and extinguish, all progressive literature.   It is essential to understand when measuring up cur work, -that oi-r staff is inadequate through our Inability to financially support them, and we &quot;ere,&quot;concentrating Ota/ attention to the practical wo rk of organising the revolutionary element inside the various organisations.&quot;If we are successful in our appeal to the sympathisers inside the trade unions in obtaining financial assistance which will enable us to publish a fortnightly paper containing our ideals and principles this difficulty will be partially overcome.&quot;W-.Z, Poster, of the Trade Union Educational League,Chicago, is trying to arrange a lecture tour for Tom Mannin the States, to begin next month.
