From Viceroy, Home Department, 8th November 1921.

Following is abstract of summary of situation as it developed between the 27th September last and 21st October received from the General Officer Commanding, Madras :-

Change in rebel tacties from open to guerilla warfare has steadily developed and shows increasing signs of more intelligent and efficient handling. As rebellion goes on, more people become implicated and committed ; attraction of loot and terrorisation 4885 100 11.21


brings in new recruits. Whole of Ernad Wallavanad ^vitli portions ol: Calicut and Ponamii Taluqs are involved, Not every Moplali is in active rebellion, but behind the bands remainder take part in such looting, ambushing and dacoity as comes their way, reverting in intervals to peaceful life. Situation is not out of hand in military sense, but tendency will be for active bands to become smaller, more numerous and elusive, for claeoity to increase, and for bulk of population to become part-time as opposed to whole-tir/ie rebels. General Officer Commanding accordingly asked for what he considers maximum number of troops required. This requisition, as already intimated, has been met by despatch of two more Indian regiments. This, with additional police (which are being provided), will permit (1) active operations to be continuous, (2) prevention of rebels against whom these operations are in progress from moving to another place, (3) immediate action to be taken on local information, (-1) repair and safety of roads, bridges and communications being secured.From Viceroy, Home Department, 9th November 1921.Home No. 10G-1- Pol. Malabar disturbances. Following is report from Madras district, dated 6th November, received 8th: &quot; Situation. 18.00 hours, and for the Madras Press. Platoon, 61th Pioneers, cleared Manjeri-Arrikkod Bead yesterday, and reached Arikkod, which has nothing-further to report. Dorsets from Malaparam reconnoitred. Vellur police from Kunnainanjalam visited Ohattamangalam and Tamarsheri, and found all quiet.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 10th November 1921.107.1. Pol. Madras Government have been asked to furnish every week appreciation of situation in Malabar for transmission to you and publication. Following is report for week ending 7th November :  &quot; Spread of Mopilla rebellion from area hitherto mainly affected to Calicut Taluk has caused considerable anxiety, but reasons believe call to arms in those parts lias not met with very general response. A. number of rebel bands have, however, done considerable damage. They have also been engaged in looting, forcibly converting Hindus and collecting arms. Party special armed police sent deal with situation Calicut Taluk were ambushed at end October, and accounted for 26 rebels,; but of their own number six were wounded, including Mr. Colebrook, who had just been appointed to command the Company, with one killed. Mr. Colebrook&apos;s wounds are not serious. Active steps being taken deal thoroughly with situation, and not expected trouble Avill spread further north. It is, however, most important order should be restored here before dealing with- interior Ernad and Walluvanad Taluks, both for military reasons and also to safeguard planting area which lies further to north in Taluk of Wynad aud lines of communication thereto, on which planters depend for their transport. At Kongptti in Ernad a band attacked local Mopillas, who are Shiahs, and met with resistance, but succeeded in destroying Sub-Registrar&apos;s office and police station, and in damaging tomb of local Thangal or Mopilla religious leader (Shiah). Elsewhere in affected area military have been busy, and have met with local successes, but, in one case, party of rebels, who surrenderee! some time ago, have again taken the field, and, in another case, some coolies, who assisted Gurkhas in getting their transport across a river, were subsequently attacked, aud 15 of them were captured and murdered by rebels. In most seriously affected areas, therefore, there seems to be no alternative to dealing with rebels in detail, and this is bound to be long and difficult business. There are signs, however, in some parts of increasing desire on part of rebels to surrender, and on 7 th November it was reported that nearly 1,000 from different places in neighbourhood of Malappuram had signified their submission where overtures had been received from other quarters. It remains&apos;to be seen how far their professions are genuine, and, in any case, problem of how to deal with them, is difficult one, and this, together with problem of treatment of refugees, who are now very numerous, is engaging attention, of local authorities. The reinforce-ments asked for towards end of October have arrived. The Local Government have also sanctioned increase force of special armed police, which was formed at beginning of October, to double its original strength in Malabar under new Indian Territorial Force Act, and number of applications from Hindus for enrolment is reported very satisfactory.&quot;

From Viceroy, Home Department, 22nd November 1921.1201 Pol. Continuation our telegram dated 15th November.

Drive of country north of Bey pore river and then south of river to Feroke Kondotti Edavana Road was carried out successfully. On several occasions troops met with determined resistance from resolute bands Moplahs, and total number casualties inflicted during drive was 283 killed, 51 captured and 31 guns We also sustained casualties, including one Gurkha officer killed and one (? British officer) wounded, mortal. Effect these operations has been good, and though, it cannot be said that area has been entirely cleared of rebels, reasonable expect there will be no active resistance here for some time to come. Rebels, however, in eastern area took opportunity during absence of bulk of troops taking part in drive to make early morning surprise attack in force on Gurkha post at Pindikkad on 14th. About 60 Moplahs succeeded in penetrating post before men were properly awake, and severe fighting ensued, which ended in at least 234 Moplahs being killed ; these bodies were burnt same day. One British officer, Capt. Averell, and three other ranks were killed, 34 other ranks were wounded. As forecasted in last weekly telegram, one result of drive seems to have been to spur rebels on to desperate efforts. Large concentration Moplah under all best known leaders reported have taken place near Chainvrasseri; and it would probably be most satisfactory, from military point of view, if these could be induced to give battle, &apos; Petitions offering submission continue to be received from country round Malappuram.
