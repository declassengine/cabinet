This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government--- ; i -SECRET.I /3533.THE CABINET. &apos;BRITAIN AND THE TURKISH NATIONALISTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.\ &apos; With reference to CP. 3474, I circulate two telegrams which have recently been received from General Harington.L. W.-E.The War Ofjfiob,7 th December, 1921.r3rd December, 1921.Some very active propaganda is being put about here, in an attempt to embroil me in some supposed negotiations with Angora which I think I ought to report for your information.Fact that while in England I attended Cabinet meetings, my private visit to Sultan to thank him for his house, and fact that ex-Major Henry and some other business men have gone to Ineboli on business to meet Rafet, have been construed into deep laic! British plot, in which I am depicted as principal villain, to negotiate with Turks.Truth, is as follows : no action of any kind has been taken by me ; nor have I any wish or intention to dabble in work which is not mine.Both in London and since my return here I consistently refused to see ex-Major Henry, and I was totally unaware that he was going to Ineboli as, very day before, he asked permission to bid me good-bye prior to his departure for London, for which he obtained his berth and passport. It is reported that he cancelled his passage that night on receipt of letter from Rafet. It is possible that my name is being made use of by him and his friends to further their business interests, but entirely without my authority.   Stories of a so-called (?) British Mission are pure fabrication.Sometime back, my office received application from ex-Major Henry for facilities to go to Anatolia, and informed him that he should obtain letter from Foreign Office.His passport for London was only facility afforded him.He stated that he had five times unsuccessfully attempted to see British High Commissioner to obtain business facilities, since which he had joined French company.An Italian steamer, which was for three days weather bound in Bosphorus, conveyed party.So far from being official mission, I was totally unaware until last moment of anyone&apos;s going to Anatolia, and, as soon as fact that London plans were cancelled and that party were going to Ineboli became known, information was given to High Commissioner.1st December, 1921. Well informed agent, recently returned from Angora, reports as follows : Angora, being in process of a settlement with Italy and having concluded separate peace with France, is desirous to come to terms with Great Britain. They have been convinced of Britain&apos;s good faith by recent exchange of prisoners. Flushed with victory and strengthened by settlement with Persia and Caucasus States&quot;, however, Angora stands on basis of national pact. - On conclusion of peace with three Allies,(b21/377)   100  12/12  h&amp;s, Ltd  9596wo
feels itself able to settle with Greeks. Angora is willing to meet Great Britain, and, if agreement is reached with England before Greeks are expelled from Asia Minor, will renounce claim to Mosul Vilayet and accept frontier (seven groups omitted telegraphically) Ibn Omar. If, however, England delays agreement, frontier as far south as the lesser Zab river, including Kirkuk and Suleimanieb, will be demanded by Angora.Under former circumstances, Angora will, in spite of hostility to Emir Feisul, refrain from propaganda in Mesopotamia and will assure her peace in Egypt, Mesopotamia and India. But Angora will carry out violent anti-British propaganda through British Moslem territories if England refuses.Insurrection of Pontus Greeks was result of Greek propaganda during Turkish retreat. Plot was discovered in time by Nationalists who have deported all Greeks, between ages of 15 and 55, from Black Sea coast to frontiers of Syria and Mesopotamia and to neighbourhood of Diarbekr. 12,000 are in mountain area between Amassia and Baiburt.Please wire your comments. Military and political information received in past from Agent in question has always been very reliable, although latter information may possibly be coloured with propaganda on certain points. It is probably safe to accept unless anything stated is known to be inaccurate.
