 This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP.-3539.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE  STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 5th instant.-General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.I am glad to note that the Police reports for the week point to a marked improvement in the observance of the truce on the part of Sinn Fein. The total number of breaches reported was considerably less than those ofrecent weeks, and with one or two exceptions none of the breaches were of a very serious character. The new liaison arrangements have no doubt contributed to this general improve-ment, but I have reason to believe that it is in a great measure due to an earnest, if somewhat belated, effort on the part of the Sinn Fein leaders to tighten up the discipline of their followers, which, especially in the more remote parts of the country, has given them grave cause for anxiety.The most serious breach of the truce committed during the week was an armed attack, apparently with the intention of kidnapping, upon two Military Officers in an hotel at Callan, Co. Kilkenny, oh the 1st instant. This outrage was evidently designed as an act of retaliation for the arrest of two members of the I.R.A. in Callan on the 28th ultimo for the attempted purchase of. ammunition from soldiers. The assailants, who numbered from six to eight, entered the hotel about 9 p.m. and commanded the Officers to surrender, and on meeting with a refusal three of the party at once opened fire. Fortunately, both the Officers escaped injury, ahd they returned the fire with such effect that the raiders, at least three of whom are believed to have been wounded, hastily withdrew. A motor car commandeered from a local trader was found abandoned in the public street outside the hotel, and in it was a quantity of canvas sacking evidently intended for use in kidnapping the Officers.Among the other breaches of the truce; during the week- were a raid for arms on the house of a farmer in Corofin District, Co. Clare, on the 28th ultimo, the destruction by fire of an unoccupied house at Kilcash, Carrick-on-Suir District, Co. Tipperary, formerly used as a Police Barrack, on the 29th ultimo, and the partial destruction of Ballyglass Petty Sessions Courthouse, Castlebar District, Co. Mayo, on the 1st instant. An attempt to derail a passenger train at Valentia Harbour, Caherciveen District, Co. Kerry, on the 1st instant, by placing stones on the line, was probably not connected in any way with Sinn Fein.Seven cases of illegal arrests were reported during the week, in five of which the persons arrested are known to have been released. The reduction in the number of illegal arrests is one of the most satisfactory features of the general situation as compared with that of a few weeks ago. Its chief significance is that it indicates a diminution in the activities of Sinn Fein Courts, and a growing disposition to refrain from actual interference with the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts.Before leaving the subject of the truce, I am glad to record the fact that the six Army horses seized from three unarmed soldiers at Clogheen, Co. Cork, on the 22nd ultimo, as mentioned in my last report, were returned on the 1st instant by&quot; [7454]
the direction of the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, who has.stated that he hopes soon to be in a position to make reparation for other seizures of Crown- property committed since the truce.  -Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The only Court-Martial result promulgated during the week was the acquittal of three members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who were charged with acts of malicious damage to property.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 3rd instant: Total orders made     ...         ...         ...         ... ... 4,388Orders cancelled for reasons other than release 243Releases ordered             ...         ...         ... 757-- 1,000Number of persons now interned ... ... ...      3,388The number of appeals awaiting hearing is four.Attempted, escape of Sinn Fein prisoners.An unsuccessful attempt at the rescue of a number of Sinn Fein prisoners from Perry Prison was jnade on the 2nd instant. The plot was discovered by two Special Constables, who observed a rope ladder being thrown over the Prison wall from the inside, and at once gave the alarm, with the result that about twelve prisoners were apprehended near the spot from where the.ladder was suspended. The subsequent I search of the Prison resulted in the shocking&apos; discovery of the dead bodies of two Constables lying gagged and bound in one of the corridors, and two temporary warders and five other persons have been arrested on suspicion of murder. The responsibility for taking all necessary action in connection with the affair is now, of course, a matter for the Northern Government.An attempt on the 5th instant by eight-Sinn Fein prisoners to escape from Mount joy Prison was frustrated by the vigilance of the guard, and the prisoners concerned were deported to England on the same day.State of the Police Forces.The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces:  Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.Strength on the 27th November, 1921    ...         ... ...     14,316Deaths   ...         ...         v.         ...         ... 5Resignations       ...         ...         ...         ... 16Retirements        ...         ...         ...         ... 8Dismissals or discharges   ...         ...         ... 8Total wastage ... 37itecruits.Ireland ... ... ... 8Great Britain     ... ... ... 25- 33Net decrease      ... ... ... ... 4 4Strength on the 4th December, 1921 Net decrease since the 10th July, 1921 ...

Net decrease since the 10th July, 1921 ...1,440 70Dublin Metropolitan Police.The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged through-out the week at 1,137.All recruiting for Police Forces under my control stopped on the 7th December, and orders were given on same day to close down projected expenditure in connec-tion with Administrative Services, such as the provision of additional mechanical transport for the Royal Irish Constabulary.A new crisis on the Irish railways is threatened as a consequence of a recent Arbitration Award recommending modifications so far as Ireland is concerned of the universal eight hours&apos; day for railway workers. The proposed revision of the hours and conditions of service following upon the very considerable reductions that have been made in wages has aroused keen resentment among all sections of the railwaymen, and at a specially convened meeting held at Water ford on the 5th instant a resolution was passed calling for the withdrawal of the Arbitration Award and threatening as the alternative a general railway strike to, commence on the 12th instant. A partial strike has already taken place on several of the smaller Southern lines (the Cork-Bandon, Cork-Macroom and Cork-Muskerry Railways), and the greater part of West Cork is now entirely isolated.The news that a complete agreement had been reached by the British Govern-ment and the Irish Delegates in London broke like a ray of sunshine upon an Irish public plunged in a state of profound depression amounting almost to despair. It was fully realised that the crisis of the past week-end was not a mere incident of the negotiations, but that the Conference had reached a stage when real issues had to be decided, and the indications at the eleventh hour appeared to justify nothing but the gloomiest apprehensions. Of the almost universal desire for peace on the part of the Southern Irish people, there could be no doubt, but with their political life.com-pletely controlled by a semi-military organisation, the possibility of the knowm wishes of the people overriding the decision of their elected representatives was hardly a factor to be considered in any development of the situation that might have arisen. In my opinion, the Treaty of Peace will be accepted by the Irish people throughout the world as a lasting settlement and will open a new chapter in the history of the relations between Ireland and this country.New Irish Railway Crisis.Present State of Political Opinion in Ireland.H.
