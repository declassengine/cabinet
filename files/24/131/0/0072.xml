[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]&quot;,Printed for the Cabinet. . December 1921.PROPOSED MEETING AT PARIS FOR REVISION OF TREATY OF SEVRES.THERE have been three main phases of the hitherto unsuccessful effort made by the Allies to conclude peace with Turkey, viz. : (1) the Treaty of Sevres, signed in August 1920, but never ratified, and now virtually dead ; (2) the proposals made at the London Conference of March 1921, but not accepted either by the Greeks or the Turks (or if accepted by one party in any particular, then declined by the other); (3) the bases of a resumed discussion suggested by me in Paris in June 1921, but rendered abortive by the refusal of the Greeks to accept Allied intervention. We are now about to make a fourth attempt. The Allies cannot afford another failure.; and although the position has been rendered more difficult by the Angora escapade of the French, and by the. increasing intractability of the Angora &apos; Turks, the following symptoms are not unfavourable: the complete (though never too dependable) rally of the Italians to our side ; the disgust created in France, quite as much as here, by the Franklin-Bouillon trick ; the consequent re-established unity of the Allies; the consciousness of the Greeks that their Asia Minor ambitions are no longer realisable and that their resources do not admit of protracted warfare ; and, finally, some indications that the Turks also are&apos;tired of war and want peace. In these circumstances a new programme is required, adjusted to the new conditions and more liberal in its terms to the Turks but, at the same time, a programme that the Greeks can accept and which the Allies will be prepared to enforce. I have prepared a draft of such proposals; and, in order that they may be compared with their predecessors, I have had them printed in parallel columns.If the Cabinet give their general assent to the revised terms, I would then propose to send copies of the paper as printed below to the Foreign Ministers of France and Italy, in order that they may study them before we meet in Paris early in January. I had offered to go over after Christmas ; but the Italian Minister cannot be there before the second week in the new year.My plan of action contemplates two stages : (a) the meeting of the three Foreign Ministers at Paris, in order to arrive at an Allied agreement as to the terms, and as to the method of applying them ; (b) a subsequent meeting of the Supreme Council in order to place them before the Turks and Greeks. I have suggested Constantinople as the place of final meeting, because I think it would be desirable to get away from the press atmosphere of Paris, and in a less degree London; and because at Constantinople we ought to get Mustapha Kemal himself. The Turks would, of course, constitute their own delegation, for it is with the Sultans Government that we have to conclude peace. But it should be easy to make clear that Angora must be represented by its chief.The most difficult stage will be the decision of the Allies, which must be reached in Paris in advance, as to the steps,to be taken by them in the event of a breakdown at Constantinople, whether due to the Greeks or the Turks.Such a breakdown may occur in one of three ways : the Greeks alone, the Turks alone, or both together, may refuse our terms ; or the refusal of one or both of them may take the form of acceptance with impossible reservations.In the first case, Greece herself, and the Greek army in Asia Minor especially, would be, in the long run, so much at the mercy of a peaceful blockade and other indirect pressure, that any threat from the Allies should suffice to bring Greece to reason, quite apart from any offer of help to the Turks. In the last resort this threat might have to be used.If the Turks refuse, a more difficult situation arises.   It must be remembered, however, that never since August 1920 has there been a really united Allied attempt to coerce Turkey, and even then no formal blockade of the Black Sea and Mediterranean ports was attempted.   If such a sea control was attempted by the three Allies, and [7465 a]
Allied control at Constantinople were tightened, ii: at the same time the three Allies gave active help to Greece at least with money and munitions of all kinds and perhaps with some staff officers, it should not be impossible to bring Kemal to reason next spring.There will, however, be certain unknown quantities, eg., the attitude of Russia and the extent to which she can still help Kemal, the comparative strength of Greeks and Turks in men and material at that date, the ability or willingness of our Allies to join in any prolonged coercion of the Turks, and, lastly, the possible reactions in Irak and the Moslem world of an active support of Greece against Turkey, however arrogant and unreasonable the attitude of the latter might have been.On the other hand, even if the Greeks with Allied help were able to beat Kemal, and the Angora Government were to dissolve, the difficulty of any permanent settle-ment would remain both at Smyrna, which a victorious Greece could hardly in those circumstances be asked to leave, and in the interior of Anatolia, which would probably become a prey to chaos.All these considerations point to the desirability of the Allies going to the utmost limit of reasonable concession in order to reach a settlement with the Turks.Lastly, I come to the third contingency, viz., that both Greeks and Turks may prove intractable and may refuse in such a way that neither side deserves any favours from the Allies. In that case there seems nothing to be done except to hold the ring (neutrality as usually understood towards both parties) for another campaigning season, when a decision in Asia Minor one way or the other may be reached. This third situation seems the least probable, if only in view of the power of the Allies to put effectual pressure upon the Greeks.Hypothetical as such a discussion must be, I should like to reach in advance a measure of agreement in Paris as to common action in each case on the above lines.With the accompanying summary of proposals, 1 circulate four maps which I have had prepared of the areas that will have to be dealt with, viz., (1) Smyrna ; (2) Eastern and Western Thrace ; (3) Cilicia ; (4) the demilitarised zones on the Straits.C. of K.December 19, 1921.

SMYENA.Area.No discussion.1. SMYENA.There is Allied agreement that the , sovereignty and administration shall not be Greek, but questions of the area, the form of government, and defence are not decided. It is essential to.meet Turkey as far as possible on this question in the interests of a general settlement.Area.Here three alternative proposals &quot;may be considered:  (a.) The first is the Smyrna zone as drawn, for reasons partly of population (the American pre-war figures gave Greeks 509,000, Moslems 470,000, Armenians 23,000), partly economic and partly strategic, in the Treaty of Sevres. The Turks would probably now decline to consider any such proposal; nor, if Turkey&apos;s sovereignty is to be restored, will economic or strategic frontiers be required.(6.) The Saujak of Smyrna and the Kaza of Aivali, with a pre-war popu-lation, according to the Americans, of Greeks 410,000, Moslems 330,000, Armenians 18.000. This area would have the advantage of maintaining connection between the coastal towns and the hinterland. But Turkey&apos;s objections would very likely be maintained.(c.) I have thought of a third alternative, namely, the creation of a separate administration for Smyrna town, the Tchesme peninsula, and Aivali town. In these areas the population is, or was, predominantly
Government.(i.) Sovereignty remains Turkish. Tur-kish flag.(ii.) Exercise of rights of sovereignty is transferred to Greece. Greek adminis-tration.(iii.) Local parliament.(iv.) (Incorporation in Greece after five years on demand of local parliament.)Government.The second proposal of the ^conference comprised the following : (i.) Turkish sovereignty.(ii.) District to be Galled a vilayet.(iii.) A Christian governor of the dis-tricfc to be appointed by the Allies or League of Nations.An elective assembly.An elective council.(iv.) An annuity to be paid to Turkey corresponding with the districts pros-perity.(v.) The administrative personnel to be recruited according to the racial distribu-tion of the population as reported by an Allied commission.(vi.) (Revision after five years by League of Nations on demand of either Greece or Turkey.)The Greek delegation accepted subject to the following reservations as to (iii), (iv) and (v) : (iii.) The Christian governor should be appointed by Greece with the con-sent of the League of Nations or vice-versa.Government.Lord Curzon proposed and M. Briaiid accepted the following. The Italian Ambassador also accepted subject to his Governmenfs final approval.(i.) Autonomy under Turkish sove-reignty.(ii.) A Christian gocernor.Greek. Turkish figures in 1914 admitted Greeks 65,000, Turks 20,000 in the peninsula, and Greeks 30,000 to a few hundred Turks in Aivali town. Concerning Smyrna, there was the familiar dispute; for whereas the Greek figures of 1912 gave Greeks 120,000 to Turks 60,000, the Turkish figures of 1914 gave Greeks 74,000 to Turks 100,000.The choice between these three areas will probably be found to depend in the main on the character of the regime to be set up.Government.Whatever area is chosen the sove-reignty should be Turkish.As to the administration, here again three proposals seem to be worthy of examination.(i.) The Lebanon precedent might be considered, namely, a Christian governor chosen for three years by Turkey with the consent of the Powers and immovable without that consent, but directly responsible to the Turkish Government; a local council repre-sentafcive of different elements of the population: the governor to control all administrative appointments, and a gendarmerie drawn from the local popu -lation: Turkish troops only to be called in by the governor in an emergency.If this scheme were applied to Smyrna, the governor might be a Turkish subject of Greek race, chosen by agreement between Turkey and Greece or appointed by, but not respou-sible to, the League of Nations.Such a scheme might be applied either to areas (a) or (b) above; and it would provide a serviceable safeguard to the Greeks.    As to the Turks, the

On the other hand, they would probably regard it as a stepping-stone to ultimate separation.(ii.) The Saar Basin may suggest a precedent. There is a governing corn-mission of five appointed by the League of Nations (one Frenchman, one German from Saar, and three others, neither French nor German), with a chairman appointed by the League : the powers of the commission are similar to those of the governor of the Lebanon : after 15 years of govern-ment Ivy the commission the popula-tion is to decide the question of future sovereignty.If this scheme were adapted to Smyrna the commission might consist of nn American chairman, with two local Greeks and two local Turks appointed by the League of Nations and responsible to the latter, while the. Turkish flag could still be retained.The scheme could be applied either to areas (a) or (b) above: it might satisfy the Greeks: the introduction of the League of Nations might also satisfy Turkey by making the problem international instead of purely Allied, while keeping the administration local. On the other hand, the Turks would probably resist a sanction that reduced their sovereignty to so thin a shadow.(iii.) A third suggestion is that of municipal autonomy for Smyrna and local autonomy for Aivali Kaza and
Defence and Order garrison.Defence and Order.The second proposal of the conference comprised: (i.) A Greek garrison in Smyrna town.(ii.) Outside the town, the gendarmerie to be officered by the Allies and recruited according to the racial distribution of the population, as reported by an Allied commission.The Greek delegation accepted subject to the following reservations : (i.) Greece should fix the size of the garrison, and, in case of need, be able to move it to the frontier of the district to repel invasion.(ii.) The gendarmerie should be organised by Greek &quot; cadres,&quot; and the racial pro-portions of the population should be determined by ballot rather than by a commission.No reply from Turkey.Defence and Ordek.Lord Curzon proposed, M. Briand ac-cepted, and the Italian Ambassador accepted subject to the Italian Govern-ment&apos;s approval: (i.) A mixed gendarmerie under Allied officers.(ii.) Withdrawal of Greek troops as soon as the gendarmerie should be in working order.the Tchesme Peninsula, by the application of a miniature Lebanon scheme to each area.This plan would be the least likely to provoke Turkish opposition, and would give protection to the most corn-pact units of Greek population in this area. It should not be difficult of application in the case of Aivali, which is practically a self-contained Greek city-state already, or in the Tchesme Peninsula, which is mostly agri-cultural. But it would separate Smyrna from its hinterland, and might i therefore cause economic or adminis-tnitive difficulties there.Defence and Order.Under any of the three schemes, and for any of the three areas, the gendar-merie (or police in the towns) would be drawn representatively from the local population and placed under Allied or foreign (i.c, neither Turkish nor Greek) officers, who would be respon-sible solely to the local governor (schemes (i) and (iii) above). No other force would be kept or allowed into the area except in case of grave emergency, when the force should be Turkish, since the sovereignty will be Turkish.The Greek army now in Asia Minor should withdraw on the signature of the treaty to whichever of the three above areas or group of areas is decided upon, and should evacuate Asia Minor altogether on ratification by Turkey. There can be no doubt that it is the presence of Greek forces on Turkish soil that is the main cause of offence to the Turks, and I cannot help thinking that the Greeks are at bottom quite prepared for their com-plete evacuation.

It lias been occupied since 1920 by Greek troops. The pre-war population was about 44,000 Greeks, 124,500 Turks and 29,500 Bulgars (Greek figures). The question of Western Thrace was settled as between Bulgaria and the Allies by the Treaty of Neuilly; it does not now concern Turkey, who ceded the area to Bulgaria after the Balkan war; there is therefore no reason why the question should be reopened.Defence and Order.

EASTERN THRACE. Area.No discussion.3. EASTERN THRACE.  ; Area.This represents the Turkish vilayet of Adrianople, i.e., all European Turkey between the JEgean Sea, the Sea of Marmora and the Black Sea except for the peninsula on which lies Constantinople (see map n).The pre-war population of this area, ceded to Greece by the Treaty of Sevres, was, according to Greek 1912 figures, 325,000 Greeks, 253,000 Turks and 98,000 others; according to Turkish 1914 figures, 235,000 Greeks, 365,000 Turks and 48,000 others. It has been occupied by Greek troops since 1920.Sovereignty and Administration.The Angora Turks and their partisans talk much about the recovery of Eastern Thrace as an indispensable condition of peace; and in so far as their contentions are based upon the strategic security of Constantinople, or upon the future of Adrianople, it is not only possible but desirable to meet them (vide below).But there are grave reasons against reopening the question of Eastern Thrace in its entirety. It would neither be fair nor practicable to make Greece the victim both in Smyrna and in Thrace. It would be in the highest degree risky to give back to Turkey the sovereignty on both shores of the Dardanelles (the same objection applies to the Enos-Media line). Further, if we .reopen the Balkan question it is difficult to know where we shall stop. Roumania and others will require to be heard.On the other hand, if a commission of enquiry or a plebiscite be again jto

Programme of Proposals to be dis-cussed with Allies at Conference in Paris before communication to Greece and Turkey.3. EASTERN THRACE (contd,). Sovereignty and Administration (contd.).suggested, this is a solution to which, after the experience of the past three years, no one will feel warmly inclined. Apart from the local uncertainty and unrest which they cause, it is almost impossible at this date to take into fair account the effect of the deportations of the Balkan War and of 1914-18.The protection of the Turkish minority in Eastern Thrace under the supervision of the League of Nations is already provided for by the Minorities Treaty between Greece and the Allies signed at Sevres in August 1920 (see column 1). But as regards Adrianople the special case of these provisions should be strengthened by stipulating for a predominance of the Moslem element on the executive council of the town (Turkish 1914 figures, 54,000 Moslems and 41,000 Greeks and Armenians) and by more stringent pro-visions as to the immunities of Moslem places of worship.Defence and Order.The Turks contend that the Greco-Turkish frontier of the Sevres Treaty renders Constantinople indefensible from the land. This frontier is at its southern point about 25 miles from Constantinople, and gradually moves further away until it is about 70 miles distant -at its northern point. The claim therefore has force; and it would seem desirable to meet it by pushing back the frontier in a north-westerly

Such a change would put back about an equal number of Greeks and Turks (30,000 in each ease) into Turkey. But its real and decisive merit would be the removal of the frontier to at least 90 miles from Constantinople.A further guarantee for the military security of Turkey in Europe might be thus provided. The Greek forces in Eastern Thrace other than gendar-merie might be limited in numbers and might be confined to certain towis distant from the Turko-Greek frontier, eg., Adrianople and Kirk Kilisse. Turkish forces might also be allowed in fixed number&apos;s in European Turkey, say, at Chatalja, outside the de militaires-tarised zone (reduced as suggested by the London Conference last March to 25 kilometres from the Bosphorus see column II and- maps II and III).4. CONSTANTINOPLE, THE STRAITS AND DEMILITARISED ZONE.Con stantj nople.The threat to the retention of Constantinople by the Turks in certain emergencies (see columns I and IT) should be finally withdrawn, and as suggested above, under the heading of Thrace, a fixed number of Turkish troops might be permitted in European Thrace outside the reduced demilitar-ised zone: (under the Sevres Treaty the whole of European Turkey is demilitarised and the Sultan&apos;s body-guard of 700 men is the only force allowed in Constantinople).The complete evacuation of Constan-oo

In addition to the modification proposed In- the London Conference (see column 11), the direct intervention and control of the Allies might be replaced by putting the Commission&apos;s adminis-tration under the supervision of the League of Nations and by giving to the League the appointment of its members (these would remain as specified in the Sevres Treaty) on the recommendation of each Government concerned.The obvious attraction of this proposal would lie in the handing over of one of the great international waterways of the world to an inter-national body.

A minimum garrison for the whole Sevres zone of three battalions, and two batteries of garrison artillery, &amp;c, was proposed by Marshal Foch&apos;s Committee in London in February 1920. It might now be possible to propose a further modification of these guarantees in the following respects:  (a.) By reducing the Allied garrison in consequence of the reduction of the demilitarised zone. -(6.) By including a small Turkish and a small Greek contingent in the Allied forces on the Turkish and Greek shores respectively&apos; a proposal that is recommended by considerations both of policy and econonry.(c.) By providing in the treaty that, after a specified interval, the duty of ensuring effective demilitarisation of the zone shall be transferred from the Allied garrison either to an inter-national garrison chosen by, and responsible to, the League of Nations, or by a commission of experts sent . yearly by the League to inspect the zone and report upon it.The military experts might in the first instance be asked to report on these three proposals,

He also recom-mended that the superior officers of the Turkish gendarmerie in the neighbouring Turkish territory should be foreign and should specially report to the Allied Mili-tary Commission at Constantinople of any signs of Turkish military preparations against Armenia.Area.The conference proposed the adaptation of the treaty clauses, provided that Turkey should recognise the right of Turkish Armenians to a national home on the Eastern Turkish frontier and should accept the decision of a commission appointed by the League of Nations as to territory to be transferred from Turkey to Armenia.This proposal was in accord with the demands of the Armenian delegates.Turkish reply not received.Government.

What was usually known as Turkish or Western Armenia was the Turkish vilayets near this frontier--the Erzerum, Van, Bitlis, Kharput vilayets and parts of the Diarbekir and Sivas vilayets.The Armenian people before the war was estimated at about 2,000,000, scattered over Turkey, and 1,000,000 in Russia; the latest estimate (American of February 1921) is 1,000,000 in Russian Armenia (includ-ing 400,000 Turkish refugees) and 560,000 in Turkey (including 150,000 at Constantinople and 120,000 in Cilicia)-i.e., a reduction by massacres, famine, &amp;c, of about a million and a half.After the Turkish invasion of the Caucasus in 1915, Russia had by July 1916 occupied Trebizond, Erzingan, Erzerum, Bitlis and Van (Turkish Armenia). After the Russian revolu-tion in Mai-ch 1918 Russia retired and Turkey overran Russian Armenia, reaching Baku September 1918. Turkish occupation ceased with the armistice of Mudros, November 1918. and the three Caucasian republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan maintained a precarious existence, thanks largely to the presence of British troops. Do facto recognition in January 1920 and de jure recogni-tion by her signature of the Treaty of Sevres in August 1920 were given by the Allies to Russian Armenia as an independent State.COCO
II.-London Conference Proposals March 1921.III.-Paris Conference Proposals, June 1921.IV.-Programme of Proposals to be dis-eussed with Allies at Conference in Paris before communication to Greece and Turkey.5. ARMENIA (contd.). Arka (contd.).In November .1020, after a Kemalist attack which reached Erivan, Armenia ceded the provinces of Kars and Ardahan to Kemalist Turkey. Simultaneously Russian Soviet troops overran Russian Armenia, which has since, like Georgia and Azerbaijan, remained, except for a short interval, a part of the Russian Federal Soviet Republic. In October 1021 by the Treaty of Kars, Russia, Georgia and Armenia ceded half the province of Batoum and confirmed the cession of Kars and Ardahan to Turkey. &apos;This summary of events is sufficient n-to show the uselessness of attempting now to pursue the plan contemplated by the Treaty of Sevres (see column I) of adding to Russian Armenia a portion of Turkish Armenia in order to form one independent State. The Armenian frontier in Turkey actually delimited by President Wilson and correspond-ing roughly to Russia&apos;s occupation of Turkish territory in 1916 (described above) is strongly held by Kemalist Turkey. Russia had lost territory in the Caucasus to Turkey. Neither the Allies nor other Powers have the men or money to create an Armenian State or even a national home for Armenians (see London Conference proposals  column II) in the inhospitable and inaccessible eastern - vilayets of Turkey, even were the latter not known to be opposed to any such plan. Armenians in Turkey must trust to the
-minority provisions of the treaty if we can secure their proper execution.On the other hand, 1 submit a suggestion for the possible discharge of the obligations to which all the Allies were equally committed, and for the partial, even if inadequate, satisfac-tion of Armenians claims. Might not Turkey be pressed to accept some special regime on Lebanon lines, with either a Turk (chosen by agreement between the Allies or the League of Nations and Turkey) or a foreigner (preferably a French citizen, chosen by the League of Nations) as Governor, lor a coastal district in Cilicia, either the whole vilayet of Adana with the sanjak of Marash (to include Aintah) or the vilayet only, or a smaller area round Adana and Mersina (see map TV)?Before the war, according to American statistics, the population of these areas was : -	Moslems.		1 Greeks.Adana and Mersina sanjaks A dana vilayet Marash sanjak Total	165,000 290,000 146,000	35,000 75,000 55,000	20,000 20,000 1,000	601,000	165,000	41,000Since the armistice the Armenian population has increased by the influx of refugees. I do not put forward this suggestion with any great confidence. Its advantages are easily discernible. It would practically meet the proposal made   by   the   Armenian   delegation

Armenians them-selves might feel that their case was weakened by partition of their main scenes of residence.France, by reason of her position in relation to Cilieia, and the obligations as regards the protection of minorities which she has acknowledged there, is perhaps in a better position to advise on this matter than we are. But the obligation to Armenia is an inter-national one; and its binding character is felt with peculiar intensity in the British Parliament and by large sections of the British people.6. MINORITIES.The main differences between the minority provision of the Treaty of Sevres and the minority provisions of the treaties concluded in 1919 at Paris with European States are shown in column I.
(i.) Protection of life and liberty.(ii.) Religions freedom.(iii.) Freedom for use of any language, i i    (iv.) Scholastic freedom. +L1    (v.) Political and civil equality.(vi.) General superintendence by the 1 1 League of Nations.(2.) Provisions appropriate to the special circumstances in Turkey, viz.: (i.) Mixed commissions under the League of Nations:- (a.) To recover Christians forcibly eon-verted to Islam.(/).) To recover other survivors of de-portations and massacres.(c.) To recover their stolen or confis-cated property.(d.) To take administrative measures to re-establish these people in their homes.(ii.) Turkey reaffirms the ecclesiastic and scholastic privileges of the non-Moslem communities and cancels all legis-lation contrary thereto.(iii.) The Allies, in consultation with the League of Nations, to decide on measures for the execution of these clauses.(3.) See guarantees for Moslems in Eastern Thrace (above).(4.) See Tripartite Agreement (below)7. TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.This is an agreement between Great Britain, France and Italy which is to Hrj take effect with the Treaty of Sevres and is to be communicated to Turkey: (1.)

TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.No discussion.See Eastern Thrace (above).See Tripartite Agreement (below).7. TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.i Since the zones of influence appeared to be regarded by Turkey as severe encroachment on her sovereignty, the desirability of modifying or abolishing the agreement was discussed. It was thought that French and Italian rightsI suggest that our policy should be as follows: (a.) Maintenance of the substance of the Sevres clauses with drafting changes to render their form mon-palatable to Turkey.(ft.) Insertion in the treaty of clauses analogous to the concluding clauses of the European Minority Treaties placing the direct supervision of minority provisions under the League of Nations.(c.) Insertion in the treaty of a special clause appointing the League of Nations&apos; High Commissioner at Constantinople to watch the execution of the minority provisions, with power to send delegates to different parts of Turkey to examine and report on alleged infractions.I think that Turkey might be more likely to accept international than Allied supervision, the principle having been admitted in the National Pact of 1920. For their part the League of Nations, on a motion of the last Assembly, have already decided to appoint a Minorities&apos; High Commis-sioner at Constantinople. Clauses such as the above appear to be to con-stitute the main practicable safeguards which we can now desire for the large Greek and Armenian minorities who will be left in Asia Minor.7. TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.This agreement signed at Sevres, and afterwards published, was to have come inta force, after ratification, with the Peace Treaty with Turkey. Its terms raised strong objections from Turkey;    but   it   represents   Italy&apos;s

A zone of special French interests to be recognised in south-east Anatolia, viz., a triangular zone lying north of Syria, comprising Cilicia, and running north to SivasA zone of special Italian interests to be recognised between the French zone and the Smyrna zone, i.e., in south and south-west Anatolia.The three Governments undertake to recognise the prior right of France and Italy to seek economic concessions in their respective zones.(3.) An Anglo-Fran co-Italian financial group to take over the Bagdad Railway (in territory remaining Turkish); the French share to comprise the section in the French zone.(4.) Great Britain and France recognise that concessions in the Heraclca coed basin (on Black Sea) are reserved for Italy.(5) Great Britain and France to recognise one anothers prior right to economic concessions in their respective mandated territories.(6.) France and Italy undertake to supervise the execution of the -minorities clauses in their respective zones.7. TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT (contd.).(6.)

TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT (contd.).legitimate compensation in Asia Minor, under article 9 of the Treaty of Lon-don, 1915, for British and French acquisition of interests elsewhere in the pre-war Turkish Empire. It seems most unlikely that we can persuade the Turks to acknowledge it in its present form. The British Government, who themselves gain nothing by the agree-ment, have no intention of receding from the undertakings which they there gave to their Allies. The best suggestion would appear to be that the three Powers should initial notes on the signature of the new Turkish Treaty (to be signed on the latter&apos;s entry into force) agreeing to carry out the obliga-tions assumed towards each other in the original agreement as signed at Sevres on the 10th August, 1920.In this way we should avoid provok-ing open Turkish hostility; each of the Allies would redeem its own pledges, and there would be no need to ratify the original Tripartite Agreement, as laid down in its concluding article.(6.) Lord Curzon insisted that the duty of France and Italy to protect minorities in their zones must, not be allowed to lapse.
8. FINANCIAL CLAUSES.(1.) A Financial Commission to consist of representatives of Great Britain.France. ,Italy.Turkey (consultative only).(2.) The Financial Commission to control, both revenue and expenditure: Parliamentary modifications of the budget to bo subject to the approval of the Commission.(3.) The Financial Commission to control A Financial Inspectorate.Currency.Government loans.Grant of concessions.Customs tariff.Taxation of Allied nationals.Administration of the Public Debt.(4.) The Financial Commission to allot Turkish revenue in the following order of priority: 1. Salaries and expenses of Financial Commission.2. Current expenses of Allied garrison after entry into force of treaty.3. Service of pre-war Public Debt.4. Repayment of expenses of Allied armies of occupation, during armistice, in Turkey and Syria (British army).5. Expenses of Turkish administration.6. War claims of Allied nationals.S. FINANCIAL CLAUSES.The conference proposed (i.) That the honorary president should be Turkish.(ii.) That the Turkish delegate should have a vote on all internal questions but only a consultative voice in questions specially affecting the Allies.(iii.) That parliament should have the right to modify the budget; but if such modifications should disturb the financial equilibrium, the budget should be sub-mitted to the Financial Commission again.(iv.) That the Turkish Government should be free to grant concessions, but that the Minister of Finance should first consult with the Financial Commission as to the desirability of such concessions.8. FINANCIAL CLAUSES.8. FINANCIAL CLAUSES.M. Briand agreed with Lord Curzon that a means of control might be found which, while securing Allied interests, would not offend Turkish susceptibilities.The following programme is tenta-tively suggested, subject to the views of the financial advisers :The scheme in the Treaty of Sevres which treated a Financial Commission (subsequently modified in some par-ticulars in the proposals of the London Conference) not only represented an agreement arrived at by the Allies after protracted negotiation, but in all probabilitj&apos; the only scheme that would really provide both for payment of Turkey&apos;s pre-war debt and war claims and also for effective rehabilitation-tion of her finances and, as a eon-sequence of her administration and economic welfare. But there is, I believe, a general consensus that the Allied executive control of Turkey&apos;s administration which this would involve is impolitic and would&apos; entail an excessive interference with her independence.In these circumstances the following scheme is submitted for examination A reconstituted Council of the Debt might be set up,  on the following lines:(i.) Recasting of Sevres financial provisions somewhat on the lines of the reparation section of the Bulgarian Treaty.(ii.) Total liability of Turkey (pre-war debt and war indemnity) to be fixed at a lump sum.(iii.) Priority bonds to this amount to be issued by the Turkish Govern-ment with absolute priority over all other Turkish obligations.(iv.) Assignment of ceded revenues to the service of pre-war public debt to be annulled and decree of Moharrem altered accordingly.
iiOndon Conference Proposals, March 1.921.III. Paris Conference Proposals, June 1921.IV. Programme of Proposals to be dis-cussed with Allies at Conference in Paris before communication to Greece and Turkey.8. FINANCIAL CLAUSES (contd.).(v.) Collection of whole Turkish revenue by the Ottoman Public Debt Council* reconstituted to represent the Governments concerned as well as the bondholders : contributions of detached territories to the service of the Otto-man debt to be paid to the Council.(vi.) Revenues to be first applied to the service of the priority bonds.(vii.) Extension of principle of limitation of Turkish departmental expenditure, involved in the limitation of naval and military armaments, to the civilian departments.Such a scheme as I have indicated would possess the merits of definitely fixing Turkey&apos;s liability of maintain -ing control over Turkish finance, but in a form (i.e., the Debt Council) more familiar and therefore more acceptable to Turkey: and of enabling some money to be recovered from Turkey, while at the same time restoring her finances.To what extent it would involve an inevitable or a desirable infringemento* N.B.

of Turkish sovereignty is a point thatremains for discussion.1Another and more restricted alterna-fcive would be the reconstitution of the Debt Council and the application of the principle of the pre-war debt to war debt, involving, in trie last resort:(i.) The consolidation of Allied war claims and issue of priority bonds by Turkey as under the previous scheme.(ii.) The irrevocable, cession to the service of these bonds of certain speci-fied revenues, other than those already ceded to service of pre-war debt.(iii.) Collection and control by Italian, French and British members of the Ottoman Debt Council, brought into relations with three Governments, without interference by Turkish authorities.(iv.) The placing of any surplus, after full payment of the bonds, to the credit of the Turkish Government.Such a plan would be only an extension of the principle of pre-war debt machinery, and so would probably he more acceptable to Turkey: it would give her some incentive to raise revenue in addition to new and old assigned revenues in order to balancet N.B. Turkey&apos;s average gross revenue before the war was about   T. 29,000.000, including about  T. 4,800,000 received from revenues ceded to the Ottoman Debt Couneil. The Total annuities on pre-war obligations to be met hv Turkey are over  T. 9,000,000. Therefore the net gross revenue after payment of annuities is about  T. 20,000,000, reduced to   T. 15,000,000 by the subtraction of the territories which she has lost.If the annual charge for war debt were filed at   T. 5,000,000,   T. 10,000,000 per annum would be left for TnrVey&apos;( budget.000 oo

MILITARY CLAUSES.Subject to the views of the military advisers the following programme is suggested:  The retention of the Sevres clauses with the London modifications (see columns 1 and II), though it provides for an effective supervision over Turkish army and armaments, is probably no longer possible or desirable.There might be substituted for it a scheme by which in the last resort the life and powers of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control and Organisation would be confined to supervision over the reduction of Turkey&apos;s forces and armament, the power of the Commission to organise and control the employment of the new Turkish force being abandoned, and such organisation and control being secured by Allied officers nominally, at any rate, in Turkish service.to to

OTHER PROPOSALS.The conference made the following additional proposals :-Admission of Turkey to League of Nations to be facilitated on proof that Turkey is willing to carry out treaty.Kurdistan.Modification of clauses in accordance with prevailing circumstances, provided that Turkey should give facilities for autonomy and for protection of Kurds and Assyrians.Such a plan would have a better chance of acceptance by Turkey, and would retain the essential objects of the abolition of conscription, the appointment of foreign officers for the Turkish gendarmerie, &amp;c, the desired limitation in numbers and armament of the Turkish forces and greater economy. For these advan-tages, the price that would have to be paid would be the definite abandon-ment of any effective or direct control over the distribution and organisation of the Turkish forces of the future.10.
