Gounaris, Baltazzis and Rangabe, held in Lord Curzon&apos;s Room at 11-30 a.m., November 19, 1921.M, GOUNARIS began by enquiring what would be the future procedure in regard to the negotiations which had taken place.Lord Curzon replied that at the previous meetings he had suggested that Greece should place her interests in the hands of the Powers. To this the Greek repre-sentatives in his opinion, wisely had agreed. Since then they had presented a memorandum. He was not quite sure whether this did not imply an attempt to recede somewhat from their previous position. He would tell them in what respects this seemed to be the case : -1. He had told them at the previous meetings that, in the event of a conference with the Powers, he would be prepared to urge the solution proposed in Paris in June respecting the future of the Smyrna zone; the exact extent of that zone had not been defined. The Greek representatives now appeared to claim that the future regime of the Smyrna zone should be widely extended north and north-east, indeed up to the Sea of Marmora. He wished to make it quite clear that the June proposals did not commit him to that.2. The new regime, whatever might.be the extent of the zone, would apparently, as contemplated by the memorandum, be guaranteed by the presence of. the Greek army.. He could not accept such an undertaking. The Powers themselves must decide what instruments should be employed for the carrying out of their proposals. The Greek Government were, of course, entitled to express their views, but he could not commit himself to accept the principle that the Greek army should be used for this purpose, 3. The memorandum suggested that the Greek army should be charged with the looking after of the interests of the Christian elements.This also must be left to the discretion of the Powers, and he could say nothing in advance on this point.M. Gounaris reverted to the question of the immediate procedure.Lord Curzon replied that there had been a full discussion and the Greek repre-sentatives had agreed to place their interests in the hands of the Allies. The next step would be in his view to ascertain whether there was a corresponding willing-ness at Angora, The matter had not been rendered easier by the conclusion of the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement. On- that subject His Majesty&apos;s Government were in communication with the French Government, and he hoped that it might soon be possible for the Allies to make a serious effort to induce the Turks to agree to accept the same course as had already been agreed to by the Greeks. He could not say whether the Turks would so accept; there were signs that Angora was inclined to be intractable. He was, however, still hopeful. Something depended on the prospect of a winter offensive. If the Turks really contemplated one they might delay acceptance in order to see the result. If there was no offensive a conference might be hoped for during the winter. .M. Gownaris replied that the Greek Government did not contemplate modifying their previous declaration, but they, had thought it their duty to let His MajestyV Government and the Allies know the important questions that would arise in connection with a settlement of Asia Minor. The Greek representatives had had to bear in mind the question of tangible guarantees to the Christian population which -might be in real danger. The local Christian population had been encouraged to fight against the Turks and unless it was&apos; properly protected its position might[7234 t- 2] e
become untenable, and it would be impossible for it to remain in any territory-evacuated by the Greek army. He pointed to the analogy of Cilicia, where no Christians now dared to stay. The same tbing might happen in Asia Minor. He had been bound to point this out, for there was a possibility of extermination.Lord Curzon enquired what the Greek view was as to the likelihood of an offensive.M. Gounaris replied that accounts varied&apos;. According to one version the Turks were awaiting the arms and munitions promised by the French from Cilicia.Lord Curzon interposed that the French Government denied that they were handing over any munitions.M: Gounaris said that a telegram from Angora to Constantinople, intercepted by the Greek Headquarters, referred definitely to such an expectation, andM. Baltazzis added that this was confirmed from other sources.The Greek representatives said that the Greek Headquarters rather expected; an offensive and were quite prepared for it.Lord Curzon took note with satisfaction of the Greek adherence to their previous declaration.*M. Baltazzis said that the memorandum had been communicated for informa-tion only.As to the procedure, M. Baltazzis said that the Greek representatives would, on their return, be compelled to tell the Greek Parliament what had taken place in London. They could say that they had placed their case in the hands of the Powers without reserve, but it would be necessary for them to go beyond that;Lord Curzon replied that he did not think they would be obliged to say more. They had expressed their views very fully, and the matter how rested in the hands of the Powers. Neither he nor they could say yet exactly what could be done. But the next move was clearly with the Powers, to whom he would communicate what had taken place in London, and with whom he hoped that joint action would then be possible.M. Baltazzis enquired whether he could say what steps would now be taken to summon a conference.Lord Curzon replied that it was not possible to say so yet, nor was it necessary for them to attempt to tell the Greek Parliament the intentions of the Powers.M. Gounaris then referred to financial questions, in which, he said, difficulties were being made by the Treasury, as he believed, on political rather than on financial grounds.Lord Curzon said that under the financial agreement come to with Greece on the 10th February, 1918, it was provided that until the obligations held by the British, American and French Governments in respect of cash advances under that agreement had been redeemed by the Hellenic Government, no fresh security can be given by that Government to cover a foreign loan without the prior assent of the Governments of the United States, France and Great Britain.M. Gounaris said that he was not referring to this particular matter.Lord Curzon replied that it was not quite clear precisely what point M. Gounaris desired to make, and he invited him to send an explanatory note.He also suggested that the Greek representatives should prepare for considera-tion a formula for use in explaining matters to the Greek Parliament.
