/SHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC! MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT):. SECRET. &quot;  MWilig.P.,5514.       REPORT BY THE; GENERAL OFFICER OOMiuANDING-IN-CBIEE ON,THE SITUATION IN IRELAND E0EuTOEE.ENDING 19TH NqVEMEEJRtijl921t(Circulated-by the Secretary of State for ?.rar)*.There is some indication that thet raining of the I.R.A. is not being carried out on suoh intensive lines as previously, and that certain training establishments have been closed down. It is not known whether this is the result of a genuine attempt on tho part of the newly appointed County Liaison Officials, to prevent provocative breaches of the agreement, or whether it is due merely&apos; to the fact that training has been completed, or that the inclemea-oy of the weather wakes it difficult to compel attendance,Sinn Pein Courts arc still reported in considerable numbers, but there ho.vo recently boon instances where they havo been eancell-ed after representations have been made by tho police.     In other cases, police have dispersed the Courts,     The kidnapping of indi-viduals, to prevent their attendance at legal courts is, however, still reported from various areas, though the police arc taking steps with a viow to stopping this form of intimidation.The boycott of Belfast and English goods is being more otrlct-ly enforced, and it does not appear that any steps are being taken to prevent this.Information points to the fact that Sir James Gr&amp;ig has the unanimous backing of Unionists In the North, regarding the attitude he has adopted towards the suggestions submitted to him by the British Cabinet. * ,      4The &quot;Ulster Imperial Guards&apos;V consisting of nine battalions each 1,000 strong, paraded in Belfast on Sunday, November 13th. This force Is formed by the Ex-SorviCe Men&apos;s Association , and appears to be organised on the lines of tho old &quot;Ulster Volunteer Force&quot;..     They are not at present armed.Rumours are current &quot;that in some pales of the Country differ-ences between extremists and more moderate Sinn Polners are becoming decentuated, and that there being at present no common enemy to fight, jealousies and quarrels are cropping up within the I.R.A. The I.R.A, and the I.R, Police are no doubt beginning., to incur a certain amount of opprobrium by reason of the fact that in the eyes of txie majority of the country community,, they now represent authority.There has been some renewal of disorder in Belfast, but the arrival of troops upon the scone always has tho Effect of quieting the rioters.The evacuation of Coastguard Stations and of outlying Police Stations, has in some cases been immediately- followed by the raid-Ing, burning or occupation of those buildingo by the rebels.(Sd)     C.P.N..
