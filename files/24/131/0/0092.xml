THIS .DOC lviBNT    IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIIV... .;I0 iv.iiJESTY&apos;S GOyBRMgT.CABINET.SECRET . OVERSEAS SETTLahiEKT . L.G.  60.CP.  3590.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I have read the memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, CP. 3582, as to overseas settlement.     As this question may come before the Cabinet during my absence, I should like to put in a short and not exhaustive statement that in my judgment (and I have been confirmed in this judgment by what I have seen as Chairman of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee) it is essential that the v/ork of transferring population from this country to the Overseas Dominions should be pressed on vigorously, and that even in the present financial condition of the country, it &quot;would pay us to spend money liberally on this    service.     The strengthening oi the British population in the outlying parts of the Empire is an imperial interest of first class importance.     Further, it is quite probable that we may, for some years at all events, have to go on incurring heavy expenditure from the rates and from the taxes in the relief of unemployment In..-this country.     It seems to me the soundest form of business expenditure to. put as much money as we can possibly find into well-considered schemes of assisted emigration within the Empire and create markets for- our manufactured goods among a population of British habits.     Such a scheme for example as that put forward by the Premier of the Commonwealth of Australia should be considered on broad lines and not criticised in a spirit of immediate financial outlook or pre-war traditions.ministry of- Health,A .
