IIATIONAI OOMMB OF UNEMPLOYED ORGANISATIONS106 delegates representing- unemployed committees and two fraternal delegates attended the National Conference of . Unemployed organisations, which was held in Manchester from November 21st - 23rd.     The three following resolutions moved and seconded respectively by Hannington and Kealey, Wakefield and Pennell, Kealey and Mrs. Flattery, were passed:&quot;That this National Conference of Unemployed Organisations affiliated to the National Administrative Council of Unemployed Organisations, hereby reiterates its United Demand for &quot;Work at Trade Union Rates, or Maintenance at Trade Union Rate3T, and oalls upon the whole of the workers of Great Britain to assist the unemployed to obtain this demand.&quot;&quot;That as a means of finding employment for the unemployed in the Trades with which they are associated, the Government shall put into immediate Operation the Trading Agreement with Russia.     Further, -that in the opinion of this conference the Government are to be censured for their deliberate negligence in not -dealing with the question earlier, thus causing greater distress to the already impoverished workers in Great Britain, some of whom might&apos; conceivably have been absorbed in industry by the putting into operation of this agreement.&quot;&quot;This National Conference of Unemployed Organisations demands that as an immediate step towards obtaining Full Maintenance that the following scales of relief shall be put into-operation by the whole of the Boards, of Guardians:(a) 36/6 for man and wife; 5/- each childup to 16 years; rent up to 15/-, one cwt. of ooal or its equal in gas.(b) 30/- single persons 18 years and over, one cwt. *f coal or its equal in gas. This to apply to widows and widowers.(o)   15/- single persons between 16 and 18 years. No: deductions to be made from these amounts except from Labour Exchange.     Under no ciroumstanoes will the relief given be accepted on loan.&quot;Other resolutions passed included the following:&quot;To provoke strife and unrest in factories and national strikes on Railways, Police and, other united bodies.&quot;      Proposed by Hannington.&quot;Rent strikes and Rate strikes.     Unemployed tD pay no rent or rates until.they get work at fullmaintenance.&quot;/

Seoondea by Gallacher.&quot;Unemployed Committees to use all forces they oan muster to resist landlords from ejecting their unemployed comrar3.es from their houses;   also to resist the Police by hostile methods if they assist the landlords to gain their ends.&quot;&quot;To attempt to get the Police Forces&apos;of&apos; the &quot;&quot;. United Kingdom to affiliate with the NationalAdmin1stratire Council thereby getting them on the side of the workers against the. capitalists whose property they at present protect.&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos; Proposed by Harris,   Seoondea by Booth.&quot;That in view of the impending general election the National Labour party be approached and support promised their candidates on acceptance of the following terms:-:(a) The national unemployed demands;(b) Until the unemployed demands have been met ana full maintenance provided ho interest shall be paid on national debt unless to parties holding less than  100 in value;(o) So that industry may be restorea to normal conditions^ trade relationships&quot;with Russia shall immediately be resumed and all indemnities imposed by the Versailles Treaty be cancelled.&quot; Proposed by the Rev J, Vint Laughland.The conference agreed that the National administrative Counoil should issue a Questionnaire to the canaidatesfor election to Trades Councils, Boards of .Guardians and loo Councils and thereupon advise local unemployed as to whioh candidates were supporting the national demands.The conference decided to divide the country intothe seven following areas for&apos;purposes of organisation;&quot;(a)   London and the Home Counties, Norfolk, Suffoli Surrey, Kent, Sussex, Hlddlesex, Berkshire, with London as centre;(b)   Midlands, Birmingham or Nottingham as centre;(o)   Lancashire, Manchester as oentre;(d)   Yorkshire, Leeds as centre;(e) South frales, Cardiff as centre;(f) North Eastern, Newcastle-on-Tyne as oentre;(g) Scotland, Edinburgh as centre.&quot;The/

( U ;-,f; rIt was agreed that the time was not yet opportune for a &quot;No Bent&quot; strike and that this matter be left in the hands of the new National Administrative Council.When &quot;Out of Work&quot; was disoussed it -was stated that the average circulation of the paper was 40,000 although it touched 60,000 before the publication of the Rev. J. Vint Laughland,s paper &quot;Justice for All&quot;.     The National Administrative Counoil decided to take responsibility for the article in a recent issue entitled &quot;To the Coppers&quot;   ( vide &quot;Arrests and Conviotions&quot;^   it was agreed that no fines should be paid and that if the National Administrative Council were imprisoned the london comrades would carry on.On the whole the Conference was revolutionary inoharacter and one of my correspondents, who was present,is of opinion that &quot;the unemployed organisation will prove a more insidious body than the Communist Party.&quot;Behind the chairman was&apos;a large red banner which bore theinscription,&quot;The only solution for&apos;unemployment is the .abolition, of the capitalist system.&quot;   There was, however,a certain amount of opposition, to the efforts of communiststo gain control of. the, conference and uproar arose on several/
**  4 mseveral occasions.As regards finance Haye informed the conference on November 27th that &quot;money in plenty is coming into the National Administrative Council movement from the Russian Soviet.&quot;   The following entry was also found in the notes made by one of the delegates:- &quot;Monies arrived to-day from some Russian in Manchester.:T   The accounts laid before the conference covered the following items:&quot;N. A.C.Income Expenditure&quot;Bolman (?) StreetIncome ExpenditureAll 0.  103.7. 6. 508. 17.  444.      2.aj.6.Enquiries are being made regarding &quot;Bolman Street&quot; and the alleged receipt of money from a Russian in Manchester.The confersnce decided that contributions from members should be at the rate of Id. per week.A few publio and private meetings were held in Manchester in connection with the conference and were addressed by members of the National Administrative Council.     On November 23rd, during the progress of a meeting in Stevenson Square, windows were broken in a shop and another shop was entered and partly ransacked.On November 24th a meeting in Gorton Town Hall was addressed by Haye, Hannington, Leckie, Kealey and Mrs.Thring and the following resolution was passed:&quot;When the demonstrations at the different works take place parties of men will be told off to do certain jobs, such as taking possession of and cutting telephone wires:   such methods only toj be oarried out at firms who have their men working! overtime.&quot;On the same occasion Kealey was instructed topresent himself at v/ithington to do task work for a weelas an experiment and it was decided to re-organise theGorton/
Gorton unemployed &quot;to fight the Guardians.&quot;.THS UNElffLOY. DOn November 18th the wholly unemployed on the live registers numbered approximately 1,817,500, an increase of 28,068 on the previous week;   short-time workers-on November 18th numbs red 250,000 as oonrpared with 251,683 on November 11th.,The conference of mayors and councillors of greater london has, according to Groen, the Labour Mayor ofDeptford, decided to; recommend the local authoritiesto refuse to undertake any work unless the Governmentunemployment scheme be amended in accordance with the.demands of the deputation to Downing Street.     these demands were,.according to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;:&quot;1.     That the Cabinet Is decision to charge the local authorities two-thirds of the cost of relief work be rescinded as financially unsound.2.     That the wage-cutting policy decided on -...  the payment of only 75.per cent, of the standard rate for unskilled labour - be dropped. 43.     That preferential treatment for ex-Service-men over men who served in Government work at home be cut out, at the.request of the soldiers themselves.&quot;There are indications that sections of theunemployed are inclined to be unruly:   on November&apos;22ndabotit 700 organised unemployed from Sltham, Bexley,Dartford, v/oolwich, Srith and . Or ay ford marched to theDartford Guardians1 Institution to demand variousincreases in and additions to out-relief,   jl deputationwas informed that the scale paid was the highestallowed by the Ministry of Health;   a section of the crowd demanded that food be given them in the Workhousebut/
but were informed by the Chairman of the Guardians that only 50 oould be supplied.     The unemployed marched to the Institution where they refused to be separated and the whole body entered the building.   The men demanded a meal for all, sang the &quot;Ked Flag&apos;-&apos; and expressed the! intention of remaining all night if necessary;   a prod that they should return to their homegwas first defeats a large majority but eventually the extremists realises! that only a small number was prepared to resort to violent measures and all left without disorder after receiving tea;    they were in the Workhbuse about 2-g- hoOn November 28th unemployed invaded a meeting of Brith Urban Council, where they howled down a labour councillor who opposed the suggestion that the unemployment should be allowed to ride free on the trams at certain hours of the day:   the resolution was carried, as v/as another to the effect that a typewriter be purchased f the unemployed committee.Part of the offices of the &quot;fr It hams tow. District Council have been allocated to the local unemployed whit congregate there daily to play cards and dominoes;   the are allowed a plentiful supply of coal and keep two or three fires going;   the meeting place is becoming the haunt of local extremists.The Csmberwell unemployed have split into two sec one run by Bcmnett in conjunction with the Mayor, the other by extremists such as Ray, Vincent and Fanning.It is reported that the London District Council oil j &apos;   Unemployed has been approached by Murray, the secretary? of the Builders1 Trade Union, in regard to a demonstrat of unemployed whioh it is proposed shall goHo Ewell and&apos;protest
protest against the action of those -unemployed who have begun building work as a relief measure at 75  of the trade union rate.It is proposed that the London District Council shall present a petition to the conference of the Labour Party and Trade Union Congress which is to be held at the Memorial Hall on December Cth,On November 22nd a man named Elliott removed his furniture from a flat in Haddonhall Street, Southwark, in order to avoid ejectment:   on the same evening a number of youths who called themselves unemployed took possession, acting, it is believed, in connivance -with Elliott.&apos;Erom the provinces it is reported that there is still much opposition to the rate of pay for relief work and strikes have occurred in some districts.   The unemployment situation in Lancashire and Cheshire shows little&apos; improvement, the mining industry being particularly depressed:   my correspondent reports that in Cumberland also notices have been issued that the pits at the new Rlsehow and Sertha collieries near Karyport will be closed until further notice on December 3rd.     Relief work in Lancashire has been held up in several places owing to strikes of the unemployed against the 75$&apos; scale,-the latest case being at Bolton where 700 men have been on strike for a week:   these men formed part of a deputation of 3,000 which marched on November 25th to the Union Relief Offices to demand relief:   the temper of the demonstrators was uncertain but there was no disorder. The. Liverpool unemployed committee, which is entirely communist, has been refused further use of the Stadium as headquarters and is demanding a suitable hall in the centre of the city:   on November 24th Braddock announcedthat/
that- ujieTirj3Xoyed..j)ro-oe-s.ffi.ous would be resumed anc! continued until the police arrested the leaders or they were given the use of a hall.Just before midnight on November 29th a crowd of about 250 Liverpool unemployed assembled in Islington Square in order to march to Sefton Park and in the words of one of their leaders, make a nuisance of themselves to the residents.     The unemployed were ordered to disperse, but refused to do so and a souffle with the police ensued: some bottles, a ohair leg, a poker and a hammer were afterwards found.      On November 30th about 2,000 unemployed marched through Liverpool:   there was no disorder, but at the end of the march the unemployed were formed into a so-called &quot;Army&quot;.     &quot;Seotion commanderB5&apos; were appointed, the orowd was drilled and a violent speeoh was made by Braddock.My Crewe correspondent reports that the employees in the London and North Western signal shop have had their working time reduced to one day per week. ^Discontent is growing among the Nottingham unemployed owing to reductions made in out-relief.     The Leicester unemployed committee has not been very aotive during the past week owing to the absence of their leader, Robert Harvey, at the Manchester conference.     The motor show in London has resulted in a slight decrease in unemployment in Coventry. /&quot;Unemployed committees in some of the chlbf Yorkshire towns are pressing the national demands of the National Administrative Counoil but my correspondent reports that the unemployment -Situation In the- mining district of South Yorkshire is easier.The moderate sections of the unemployed in Glasgoware/
ara much concerned about rent, applications for evictions in the courts having raached 700 in one day.     Since theconviotion of John Maclean, Harry MoShane has lost much&quot; ii of his hold on the local unemployablas and the attendance at his meetings has been much smeller.*THE COMMUNIST PARTYlast week the Executive Committee of*bhe Communist Party held a throe days1 meeting and the principal pointscovered were, according to the national organiser:1.     &quot;The endorsement of the principle of working within the Trade Unions.&apos;&apos;2*     &quot;The acceptance of the principles of probation for membership (no specific details were agreed upon on this matter).3.    . &quot;There was opposition to the idea, of electing the Executive from the Party conference.        04.     &quot;It was agreed that a Party conference be called somewhere about the middle of January at a place yet to be decided upon, the business of this conference being to ratify the various theses as discussed by the 3.C, and I think the question of the policy of the Party in its relationship to the labour Party will also be taken.   This conference.may be classed as a policy conference and in no way invalidates the regular Party conference.&quot;Bell added:&quot;The policy for the Miners&apos; federation-of Great Britain will appear in next week&apos;s issue of &apos;The communist, not as we had intended as a bulletin - on the score of expense - but as an ordinary part of the paper, later to %e set up and issued in leaflet form to be sold at -g-d or Id. .1th regard to the general industrial policy, this matter was not completed as a statement prepared by . Cook and Webb sent along to me seemed to be mixing up platform and, preamble, and not at all separating fundamentals from the immediate programme. &apos; The consequence was we could only report progress to the 3,6,, but we hope to have the thing finally completed in two weeks time... Again I have to say that the stringency of finance has become a &apos;   reality with a capital &quot;R&quot;, and I would like your observations on wht.t conceivable forms of economy might be effected with the least possible injury to the work presently being put in.&quot;On November 26th the london labour Party, in annual conference, decided, by 320 to 232 votes, to urge/
urge the National Executive&quot;to aooept the latest application of the Communist Party of Great Britain for affiliation, providing that that Party is prepared to abide loyally by the Constitution and programme of the Labour Party to the same extent to which they are binding upon &apos;     those societies already affiliated.&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, commenting on this decision,stated on November 27th:&quot;If the Communists are able to be as realist in their policy as is Lenin, if they are able to sea that no progress is possible in this country without the active oo-operation of the great trade unionist movement, they will at once send in an&apos; application for affiliation to the Labour Party, and with thsfc application state clearly and categorically their intention of working loyally within the movement not for its disintegration, but for the overthrow of the capitalist system and the establishment of the new sooial order.It is of interest to note that Arthur MacManus inhis chairman report to branches for November, wrote:&quot;Quite recently an Executive statement on the position regarding the relationship of &quot;the Communist Party to the Labour Party was circulated around the Branches.   Up to date that position still stands, there having happened nothing of note to alter in any way the circumstances.   &apos;*7e concentrated upon a propaganda which-.will teach the Labour Party that if they think they can get rid of us by simply closing the door on the Communist Party, then they a very far wrong,   There is bound to arise in the very near future right from the midst of their own ranks a volume of communist defiance which will teach the Labour Party and the reactionary Trade Vnion officials, that the Communist section of the working class movement is a live and determined one, and not to be dismissed so easily.  ^Arrangements are being made by the Executive Committee to ensure a discussion throughout the Party .based on the general experiences since our formation and it is hoped that this discussion will result in an effective working policy.&quot;five members of the&apos;Stepney Borough Council havedecided not to attend meetings of the Labour Party onthe Council on the ground that the Stepney BoroughCounoil Labour Party &quot;does not truly represent or carryout the principles of the National Labour Party&quot; but rather supports the principles of the Communist Party.James/
James Gordon, who has been touring Scottish branches,reported as follows:&quot;Edinburgh   -   Very active and enterprising but not working harmoniously.Leith   -   26 members, colourless, indifferent branch.Newton   -   Has no experience of organisation...8 members...There are less than 100 people in Newton,Broxburn   -   Very small branch...bankrupt.,,members vigorous.Tranent   -   A fair branch...members all miners.Gorebridge   -   Branch out of action...victimisation has made members very tiraid.Musselburgh   -   11 members...not a good branch... hard hit financially...&quot;Tom Bell, in commenting on the first batch of reports on Scottish branches (vide Report 130) wrote:&quot;What i am after is to get a list of the occupations and unions to which the members belong with a view towards trying to centralise industrial activities.&quot;Glasgow   communists and some of the extremist unemployed propose to organise opposition at a forthcoming meeting of the Reconstruction Society in the Mollinsburn Street United Pree Church when a speaker intends to expose the Proletarian School movement.THE RED INTERNATIONAL OP LABOUR UNIONSThe chief officials of the British Bureau ofthe Red International of Labour Unions have sent thefollowing interesting reply to the Moscow communicationsgiven in Reports 130 and 131:-   &quot;We realise that the connection department has functioned very defectively from its veryinception/
-ie -inoeptlon until the present time, definite steps should immediately he taken by which communication can he easily maintained between ourselves and you at headquarters so that we may be in possession of up to date information with regard to deoisions at Moscow, and also developments In&apos;Great Britain.1*     &quot;The trade union movement of this country is now passing through Tthe valley of the shadow of death&apos; never during the whole historical past of British Trade Unionism oan we find its parallel.&quot;The Miners&apos; Federation, of Great Britain, whia has for fifteen years led the attack, and taken up the aggressive with vigour and determination ( is now adopting the policy of cap in hand) imploring and beseeching the philanthropic government, to further subsidise the industry, so. that the enormous wage cuts would not be felt so keenly. After several interviews of this character, they are definitely informed that henceforth the&quot; industry must become a remunerative concern, and wages must be fixed aooordlng to the, eoonomio condition of the industry.     Vvith fcwd* hundred and fifty thousand unemployed miners.     In the engineering industry similar conditions prevail huge wage outs take place periodically, reducing thi standard of living far below the level of 1914.&quot;Therefore every worker regardless of what his occupation may be is dealt with -in precisely the same fashion as the. miners, with this difference, that the miners fought heroioally to save the situation, whilst the other organisations endeavour to cover their retreat by making strong verbal protests and flimsy objections,&quot;This has a two-fold effect upon the workers? position in this country,   Economic pressure forcing some to take up the position Of the left wing movement, whilst the other seotions are becoming more docile than ever, the revolutionary workers of the Red International and. the Communist Party are informed by the management of the various industries that they may resume w^rk, conditionally, the condition laid down being to abandon their membership in these organisations, and cease conducting revolutionary agitation amongst the workers.     if this rule be complied with, they are allowed to resume their work, yet large numbers are moving leftwards,S.     &quot;Re the oalling of the national conference of minorities that you mention in yojir letter, we do i oonsider it advisable at this juncture&quot;to call a national conference of minorities, we realise that the:eoonomic position of the minority groups would lend itself to failure and not to suooess, we realise that a preparatory.work has to be accomplished before such a conferenoe oan bring good results to the movement, this preparatory wort is oarried on first in convening &apos;four represents^conferences/
conferences in the four largest industrial centres&apos; composed of delegates constitutionally:eleoted by the branches and therefore able to report with regard to the work of suoh conference to their branoh meetings, thereby propagating the views of the Red International through official channels,3.     &quot;With reference to the weekly paper mentioned in your letter,, this matter has been thoroughly disoussed b? Comrade Mann, myself end Pollitti   we are in perfect agreement with this *suggestion, and are working strenuously to establish a press fund.     We have circularised seven hundred, branohes with regard to this matter asking them to forward subscriptions to the press fund to enable us to publish a fortnightly paper through which our views oan be successfully plaoed before the workers, this will depend entirely upon the response to our appeal on the question of finance,4.     &quot;We recognise the desirability of being represented upon the International Bureau, and for that&apos;representative to participate ir its important work, yet we are desirous of retaining tha^s^rvices of as many oapable workers as possible at this juncture to consistently carry on the fight against reaction in this country, until such time as the revolutionary industrial movement will function effectively and capably on the field of struggle, it leastiuntil the January conference we ask you to carry on-without a British Representative after that we will endeavour to comply with demands of&apos;the International Bureau, we&apos;intend sending one, if possible two representatives.   .5.     &quot;The attitude&apos;.- Of the adherents to the Red International of labour Unions in England with regard to the campaign carried on against the Russian Trade Union Movement in refusing admission to their delegates to the International Clerks&apos; Congress and in their reactionary policy in general?   We oppose them every inoh of the way our representatives inside the organisations are exposing the wily tactics of the reformists,&quot;In reply to your question (whether special articles have been published in our papers upon this matter) I might Inform you that there are no papers in this country that will publish controversial matter not even the 1Daily Herald1, much less the Capitalist Press which cunningly avoid even the publication of reports of revolutionary meetings, realising that in so doing they popularise our view point.     The whole explanation is we have no organ of our own through&apos; which such matter can be brought before the worker, until this need is practically met, we shall lack the neoessarjr publicity.6,     &quot;We receive no literature whatever from Moscow nor from the Central European Bureau, information has reached us that the 1 Workers&apos; Dreadnought&apos; have in their possession all the English bulletin, why is this?   This I have fully explained in a previous letter, and a very unfortunate position to find ourselves in.   We understand that Central Europeanoountries/
countries are able&apos;to obtain this in abundant gu&amp;ntiti for distribution and circulation, we would urge upon you the neoessity of sending supplies to this country.     The resolutions of the first Congress we ha not yet printed, with the exoeption of the oonstitutio oopies of whioh have been forwarded to you, the resolutions we are unable to print until the flnanoial position of the bureau becomes strengthened through th payment of national affiliation fees.7.     &quot;Question of unemployment;   the position of the left wing union movement upon&quot;the Question of unemployment has been, and is, to &quot;line up with the Unemployed Organisation of this oountry in their demand for &quot;Work at full trade union rate of   pay or &quot;Maintenance at trade union rate of pay realising that no permanent solution can be found to the unemployment &apos; problem under the present system we aiTe prepared to reoommend the acceptance of palliatives, when they do not obsoure the end we have in view.   The Unemployed publish a weekly paper oalled 1 Out of work, this has a weekly minimum circulation of over sixty thousand copie and contains some good material.   This question has been dealt with under the Unemployment Act, and slight improvements have been acquired, under the old scheme the dole amounted to fifteen shillings per/week for the registered unemployed person, either married.or single, and to this extent slight improvements have been seou.rei the new scheme allows fifteen shillings per.week&quot; for th unemployed person, plus, five shillings for the wives of married men, plus one shilling, for each child up to four in number.     At Manchester yesterday a.National Conference of the Unemployed was opened, the business w cover three days.8.     &quot;Your Question with regard to the position that we took up on the split in the Transport Workers Federation?   Also our failure to support Robert Williams in creating a new Seamen^ Organisation in opposition to Havelock Wilson*s Union.     We considerad it to be taot to remain neutral in a fight between two organisations one as reactionary as the other, the -dispute originated in the failure of the National Union of Seamen and Fireffl to support the Cooks and Stewards in their reoent strike When the National Union of Seamen and Firemen decided to breakaway from the Transport Workers&apos; Federation a minority led by Shinwell of Glasgow and Cutter, the secretary.of the Cooks and Stewards, the former a &apos; reformistio member of the Independent Labour Party, the latter a yellow reactionary that opposes the revolutions policy of the rebsl element whenever occasion arises. This latter move claims the support of Robert V/illiams because it becomes a component part of the New; Transport federation, and not because it differs in its policy fro the reactionary union of the seamen,   At this junoture the rebels in Hull and Liverpool are struggling to form a revolutionary seamen&apos;s organisation based upon the decisions pf the First Congress of the Red International of Labour Unions to observe the attitude of;the revolutionary nuclei as we have done, is to discover that they do not support either.of the two reactionary unions, but are focussing their attention upon the new revolutio union in process&quot;of.formation.in the North.   The fight between Havelock Wilson1 s Union and the new Seamen^ unio is taking on a very bitter aggressive polioy.     Wilson,. through/
through co-operation with the shipping federation, is endeavouring to get all shipping firms to refuse to sign on any seaman that does not oarry the ticket of the National Union of Seamen and Piremen.   What&quot;will he the result of this aotion of Wilsonrs we are,unable to accurately predict.   At the opportune moment we shall take advantage of the situation and exploit it in the .   interest of the Red International of Labour Unions.&quot;The British Bureau is organising an &quot;International Red Week&quot; from December 1st - December 8th:   the object of the oampaign is to win over as many unions and branches of unions as possible to the Red International of Labour Unions;    in sending an appeal for publication in the &quot;Worker&quot; (the substance of which appeared in the &quot;Deily Herald&quot; of November 29 th) Poll itt wrote, &quot;We have only just received notioe of the proposed Red Week campaign and bur financial position is so desperate that this is the only way we can publish the news that such a campaign i3 to be oarried on.&quot; The orders for an &quot;International Red Week&quot; were received by the British Bureau from the Moscow Executive of the Red International of Labour Unions.Efforts are being made at the moment to win over the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkerto the Red International of Labour Unions.     John Strain,&apos;- who attended the Moscow Congress in August last, has circulated the Scottish branches and Tom Talsh, national secretary of the Federation of Shop Stewards in the Building Industry, is also pushing the Red International:     he has convened a conference of carpenters in the London district in order to advocate affiliation to the British Bureau, ,Jack Tanner, who attended the syndicalist conference in Berlin on his way back from America, is not in London and wrote last week, &quot;I have been fixing up my unemployed benefit.   There is a doubt yet whether I shall get the State.&quot;TEE/
THE WORKERS&apos;  COMMITTEE MOVEMENTLack of money and the active competition of th.3 Communist Party have greatly weakened the position of the Workers&apos; Committees in the coalfields; the national secretary has sent the following statement to the chairman of the Scottish section:&quot;South Wales&quot;The whole of the Workers&apos; Committee Movement has been broken up due to the aftermath of the lock-out and owing to the fact that the Party have concent rated in ths part, of the country with an industrial policy and placed organisers in the districts for that purpose.   Those organisers now state that there is no further need for the Workers&apos; Committee Movement as the Communist Party can do all that is necessary through Industrial Groups of the Party.   Tom Thomas, who was responsible for the movement there was sent down for 2 months, prior to his going down the movement had. almost broken up and when he came out had washed out altogether.   There is no committe in South Wales at the present time.&quot;Lancashire&quot;About 15 groups were brought into being during the look-out and after the men had gone back, the committees in some cases endeavoured to carry on inside the Lodges. The districts are somewhat far apart in this part of the country and a difficulty has been experienced in maintaining oontact with the committees.   A few local conferences have been called, but not very successfully. There are now six of the committees left and are carryingp on in a small way.   One of these has a membership of 60, but have paid no fees into the Head Office.   The movement however, is still in existence.&apos;3&quot;YorkshireM32 committees were in existence at the end of the lock-out. Some of these were the old committees of long standing. It appears that there are now about 15 carryi on. two of them having only 3 members. Others have from 6 to 25 members. A few shillings have been sent in for affiliation fees, but I understand that most of them have paid in their full quota to the District Secretary. Thes committees can be looked upon as being permanent and will continue the work.&quot;No tt inghamshire.&quot;20 committees wore formed during the lock-out and a great deal of good work was accomplished.    At the -prese time there are not more than 3 committees in existence. Here also, a few shillings have been paid in fees to Head Office.   The whole of the movement in Notts is very woalcat./
at the present tine, but the spirit is there and the men wocLi rally again if a crisis aroso.    This position la hot a lot. of use to &quot;us as a permanent organisation and in no way can&apos; we say that the movement would be self-supporting.&quot;Durham       &apos;&quot;&apos;In Durham, there was about 12 committees actually formed but at the present time I have only the track of one committee.   George Harvey&apos;s committee has never paid anything, but a committee in Boldon, has naid fees.    With the exception of that committee Durham is dead.   What is required in Durham, is a live man to tackle tne situation, as Harvey seldom or ever writes to my many enquiries and circulars; and in fact have not taken part in the ballot or explained why.&quot;Scotland&quot;Sootland shows the most progress, on paper, but I have not been able to verify the committees formed, owing to non-correspondence.    I am hoping to receive a report in this direction in the near future.   No fees have been paid and there are 1,000 cards knocking about somewhere, none of which have been paid for.&quot;That is the position in the. Mining Section at the present time and I trust your&apos;committee will consider their future activities with this information before them.    I am by no means pessimistic, as I realise that we shall function better at a time of crisis than in quiet times, but I should like to see an.attempt made to keep the committees alive by creating interest locally.   The funds of the National Workers&apos; Committee Movement is nearly depleted and a meeting of the new National Administrative Council .   will be called as soon as possible to consider our future position&quot;.J.

SIMM FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINTho oases of the theft of machine guns and rifles from Chelsea and Windsor Barracks, reported in our&apos; last week&apos;s Report, are developing on satisfactory lines, satisfactory in, the sense that the evidence does not indicate anything of the nature .of organised disloyalty in the ranks of the Gtiards or indeed, in day other Regiment. So far it seems clear that Sergeant Roche of the Irish Guards, whose character has always been exenplary, owes his downfall to tho twin failings of drink and bad company. There is good evidence forthcoming against the principal offenders,  the part of the case which at first looked weak.There is no doubt that in this country-there is aconspiracy to attempt to corrupt members of H.M.Js Forces,particularly those of Irish nationality.   They ere to bewaylaid in pub lie-houses and bribed with drink, and invitedto parties, etc, with the sole object of inducing them tomake attempts to steal arms and ammunition.   The following.are in custodySergoant Michael Roche, Irish Guards. Michael Roogan from Clare.John Cooley and Thomas Lynch, ex-Metropolitan Police Constables dismissed during the strike and residing in London.Thomas Kennedy, who is Secretary to the Jierylebone Branch of the Irish Self-Determination League&apos;.Roche appears to have been picked up in the &quot;Kingfs Arms,&quot;,Edgeware Road, London, a publiehouse frequented by irish people, and conducted to 149, Star Road, Marylebone, theresidence of a man named Cogan whose son was last yearsentenced to ten years&apos; penal servitude in connection withSinn Fein outrages round London. .T:;ere are good grounds for believing that, sinoe the truce/
trues with 1he Sinn Feinera began, the Irish Republican Army in Great Britain has been making strides and that its power and influence amongst a certain class of Irishman in* ithis country is increasing. fIrish organisations in Liverpool have boen busy during the week on behalf of the Manchester martyrs demonstrations.I The opinion amongst those who know aboul Irish affairs therel is that such gatherings have not been successful and that the average man is getting tired of this long drawiriout fight in which ho really does not count for much except in so far as his subscriptions are concerned.In Glasgow plans are in force to utilise motor cars to transport any arms and ammunition that may nave been stolen to Liverpool for transhipment to Ireland. .Generally speaking opinion in Irish oircles is that thel Irish Conference will fail owing to the Ulster difficulty and that a renewal of outrages in England is to be feared.
