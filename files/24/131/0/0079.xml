IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT. CRET.P.3578.ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BILL *Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.I ask leave to re-introduce this Bill, with certain modifications, early next session.The matter is of urgent importance for the following reasons(1)     The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1919 is incomplete without the additional powers sought to be conferred by this Bill, and many large and important schemes, approved by the Electricity Commissioners, are being delayed pending the conferring of such powers.(2)     The putting into operation of such schemes would afford employment to many workers, ranging from highly skilled mechanics to unskilled labourers.(3)     In this connection the Unemployment Committee at a meeting on 18th October, 1921, came to tho conclusion:-&quot;To advise the Cabinet that in their opinion the passage of the Electricity Supply Bill would lead to the provision of more employment, but that on the other hand it was highly undesirable to prolong the Session by a Bill which might prove controversial&quot;.(4)     The Bill as now proposed to be amended will I think be found to be much less controversial than was the case at the beginning of this year.   It is substantially the Bill of last Session reduced slightly to meet objections but, plus certain drafting amendments and additional powers which the Electricity Commissioners now find necessary in view of their practical experience in two years working of the not of 1919.The most important of the controversial clauses
which it is now proposed to omit, was clause 8 of the Bill of last Session, which enabled a Joint Electricity Authority, under certain conditions, to invade the territory of an existing authorised undertaker.     This was strongly opposed by the Power Companies, and the Electricity Commissioners unanimously recommend its omission.Another amendment which has be-:-)n pressed upon the Commissioners by the whole Electrical industry involves an alteration in the methods of charging for electrical energy, which are at present regulated by the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act 1899*     In vie?/ of modern developments those methods are now out of date, and the proposed alterations will render the Bill more acceptable to all classes of the community concerned. .(5)     The Government are pledged to legislation for Sir Eric Geddes authorised Sir John Shell, the Chairman of the Electricity Commissioners, to state on 29th June, 1921, in the course of the Commissioners inquiry into the London and Home Counties Electricity District&quot;I have every reason to believe that the Ministervof Transport will re-introduce the Electricity Bill next Session and endeavour to secure its passage into law&quot;.and this statement has been referred to in the technicalpress v(Signed)       ARTHUR NEAL.
