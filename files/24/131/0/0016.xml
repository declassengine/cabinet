With r e if ere no al-to ^JrHIrTc &quot;Or e&amp;de e** &apos;Meia6ra&quot;hdum C. P. 3308.  -Mr. Amery&apos;8 iiemorandur. CP.3343 and Mr. Baldwin&apos;s Memorandum. CP.3433 I desire&apos;to make the following observations especially from&apos; the standpoint of Scotland.3. The-Scottish Office in conjunction with, the civil authorities ia responsible for the arrangements as to prq-tection in Scotland.    It also performs functions c&quot;p.r respond-!- ing to those of the Supply Department&apos;in England and \7ales. During the recent strike the Solicitor-General for Scotland had the same responsibilities as the Civil Commissioner in England and Wales in addition to others connected with the maintenance of law and order.    I agree with Kr. Amery^s view that it is advisable that the Supply Department with the Volunteer Service Committees and the corresponding Organisa-tions for Scotland should be continued. &apos; In Scotland the Chairman of the Volunteer Service Committees represent an excellent personnel.    They have acquired considerable experience in this work.    If the Organisation were abandoned and these gentlemen   were discharged from their present (unpaid) offices it would be difficult to induce them or any equally capable men to undertake similar duties if it were deemed necessary to make preparations for future emergencies. This part of the general Organisation represents an. insurance. Its cost is neglibible but if it were once destroyed its restoration would&apos;entail considerable trouble and   possibly expense.   I suggest, therefore, that this part of the machinery should not he   destroyed without full consideration.3. Upon the wider question whether the other parts ofthe Supply and Transport Organisation should now be disbanded the following points arise:-(l) Can the risk of industrial troubles on a national scale (fomented possibly by communistic or other political activities) be regarded as negligible if one looks beyond the&apos; next few months?It appears to me to be very difficult to&apos;estimate ho?; the industrial situation will develop during the next few years.   At present the economic position of the working classes may reasonably be regarded as precluding the possi-bility of a general strike     There seems, however, to be no guarantee that this ei^ation will continue if there is a material improvement in &quot;race.   Moreover, on the political side the extremist section is constantly endeavouring to stir up industrial troubles.   Th&apos;is&quot;is especially the case in Scotland.    The experience of the coal strike, especially in Fife ^demonstrated that an extremist minority can carry their policy and induce the whole body of workers to act in a manner which by ordinary standards is contrary to their economic interests.(2) If the cost of the nucleus general organisation is excessive can it not be reduced?This would-seem to be a matter for consideration by the Departments concerned or a Committee representingthem/
them.     Prima facie it seems quite possible that a valuable nucleus Organisation could be maintained at a lower cost.(3)    Can Local Authorities satisfactorily meet such risk as exists?The experience of my Department suggests that the Local Authorities could not do much ujtil an emergency had actually arisen.     Many of the He^ds *md the leading officials of municipalities, county councils, etc., may be very willing to make preparations in advance.    In many important Centres, however, they are unable to do so because their councils include a strong section which would object to the machinery and staff of the council being utilised for the purpose.     If and when an emergency occurs the Lord Provosts, etc., and the officials are able to act because in face of. the crisis they are assured of the active support ofthe community.     If, however, preparationa are postponed until this time there is a grave risk that the strikers will secure a lead of some days which may give them a great advantage over the Authorities ond the forces of lsw and order.       Moreover-, if everything is left to be worked out &quot;on the day&quot; by Local Authorities there is likely to be over-lapping and confusion as between different Local Authorities at a time when the need for immediate action is vital.(Signed)       ROBERT MUilRO.Scottish&apos; Cf f icu ;29th liovombor, 1921
