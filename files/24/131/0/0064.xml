Committee of Hi rr.&apos; /VffalrokillS DOCUIvElOT IS THE, PROPERTY OP ,EXS- BRITAHNIC MA JES TY&apos;S,..GOyEMTIffiMT.SECRET P, 3563.CAJ3IHET HOME JIPPAIRS^ OOKnTTEE^ RA TIHG OP MAC HXNE RY. tfemorardum, by ^ the^ Minis tor , off^g,a ItjuL-G.58.I have recently received a deputation from theAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce on the sub-ject of Rating of Machinery.   The Association had un-animously adopted a Resolution In the following terms&quot;That having regard, to the diversity in the practice &quot;of Public Authorities in the rating of hereditaments &quot;containing machinery (due largely to the question-&quot;able effect cf the House of Lords5 decision in &quot;Kirby v. the Huns let Union) and in the Interests &quot;of equity as between ratepayers and also as between &quot;taxpayers^  this Association takes the present oc-&quot;casion to urge His Majes ty* s government to ass pailate &quot;the English law on this-matter to that of Scotland &quot;and Ireland.&quot;The question of Rating of Machinery is dealt with at some length in the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation (1901), pages 53-56.   The Royal Corn-mission referred to the uncertainty of the law and to the great practical difficulties which had arisen in regard to the assessment of premises.used for manufacturing purposes and containing machinery whether fixed or not fixed to the premises. yAccording to &quot;the decision In one of the leading cases (Tyne Boiler Works v. Longbenton (1886)) the question is not whether machinery is rateable In Itself but whether it ought to be taken Into account In estimating the value of the hereditament on which it is placed *   In this case the Court of Appeal decided that certain kinds of machinery, though not rateable per se, must be taken into account in valuing factories.   But this decision still left the law in a great state of uncertainty as to what kinds of machinery should, and what should not, be taken into account.&apos;  In order to remove this uncertainty
the Royal. C-orarJaslori,,nrecommended that, In ssti.uating the rateable value of any hereditament-occupied- for trade, business, or manufacturing purposes, there should-be&quot; excluded from the assessment any increased value arising from machines, tools, or appliances which are not fixed, or are only go fixed that they can be removed from their- place without necessitating the. removal of any part of the hereditament, but that the value of any machinery, machine, or plant used in or on the hereditament for producing or transmitting first motive power, or for heating or lighting the hereditament, should be included.The case of KIrby v. Hunslet Union (1906) referred to in the resolution passed by the Association of Chambers of Commerce, was carried to the House of Lords and it was at first supposed&apos; that the decision given in this case had succeeded in getting rid of the ambiguity created by the use in the earlier decision of t&apos;e phrase &quot;taking machinery into account.&quot;   This expectation, however, lias not been fulfilled. &quot;It seems that the decision in &apos;&quot;Kirby v. Huns let Union means &quot;that the distinction between what is, and what is not, part &quot;of the freehold, is not the criterion for determining what is, &quot;t&apos;.:id what is not,  to be rated..    But the House of Lords have &quot;substituted no other criterion to determine the question&quot;. (Ryde on Rating, Fourth Edition, p. 620).    Ryde adds that &quot;in &quot;some parts of England the decisions in Tyne Boiler Works Co. &quot;v. Longbenton and in Eirby v.. Hunslet Union - whatever be &quot;their true effect - are in practice systematically ignored by &quot;rating authorities&quot;.This statement was confirmed by the deputation from the Chambers of Commerce who informed me that the practice of the various Assessment Committees differs not merely in different parts of the country but even in neighbouring Unions.In addition to the uncertainty of the lav; and  the diversity of practice among Assessment Committees,  the English
arvi Welsh Manufacturers complain of the disadvantage in which they are placed aa compared \?ith Scottish and Irish Manufacturers5     In Scotland, with the exception of machinery for producing or transmitting first motive power, or for heating or lighting the building, the value of machinery which Is only so fixed, that It can be removed from its place without necessitating the removal of any part of the building is, under the Lands Valuation (Scotland) Amendment Act, 1902, excluded from the valuation of the building.      (A copy of the Scottish Act is annexed.)     As regards Ireland, section 7 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1860, provides that &quot;In making the &quot;valuation of any mill or manufactory, or building erected &quot;or used for any such purpose, the Commissioner of Valuation &quot;shall in each case value the water or other motive power &quot;thereof, but shall not take into accoimt the value of any &quot;machinery therein, save only such aa shall be erected and used &quot;for the production of motive power,&quot;From time to time Bills have been introduced into parliament with regard to the Rating of Machinery, the first of these Bills having been brought in in 1887 and the last In 1920.A copy of the Bill promoted hy the Machinery Users Association is annexed, and if legislation Is introduced that Bill would no doubt form the basis of a draft, but its precise terms would need very careful consideration.The question is one of great complexity and I am avare that legislation on the subject would be controversial. At the same time my own view is that such legislation should be introduced,     It is obviously undesirable that there should be dissimilar treatment of this subject in the different parts of the Kingdom and still more undesirable that there should be(
diversity of practice among different Assessment Committees in England and Wales;    and, moreover, on general economic grounds it appears to me that it is desirable, as a matter of public policy, to relieve industry of burdens which tend to increase the cost of preduction.A, MOND. 16.12.1921.Ministry of Health,
