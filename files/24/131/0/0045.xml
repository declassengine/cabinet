[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed.for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.(CP. 3544.)CABINET.VALUATION AND RATING REFORM COMMITTEE.Report.AT the Meeting on the 23rd March, 1921 (H.A.C. 85 (3)), the Borne Affairs Committee had under 6onsideration a Memorandum by Dr. Addison, then Minister of Health (CP. 2649), in which were summarised proposals for the reform of the existing systems of valuation and rating in England and Wales, and agreed To request the following Committee to examine and report to the Home Affairs Committee on the proposals of the Minister of Health : The Minister of Health (in the Chair).The Home Secretary.The Secretary for Scotland.The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The First Commissioner of Works.The Attorney-General or the Solictor-General.Mr. R. B. Howorth, Secretary.The Committee was subsequently reconstituted as follows : Dr. Addison (in the Chair).The Home Secretary.The Secretary for Scotland.The Minister of Health.The Attorney-General or Solicitor-General.The Finaucial Secretary to the Treasury.On Dr. Addison&apos;s retirement the Home Secretary was appointed Chairman of the Committee.In addition to the relevant Cabinet papers on the subject, the Committee have been supplied with memoranda by, and have heard evidence from Mr. J. A. King, Assessor of Railways and Canals in Scotland; Sir R. V. N. Hopkins. K.C.B., a Commissioner and Secretary of the Board of Inland Revenue ; Sir A. Symonds, K.C.B., Second Secretary, Ministry .of Health; Mr. C. Knight, C.B., and Mr. Carson Roberts of the Ministry of Health ; Mr. A. Macmorran, K.C., Sir Ryland Adkins, K.C., M.P., Mr. A. Walker, C.B.E., J.P.; F.S.I., Assessor to the City of Glasgow ; Sir Lewis Beard, Kt., Town Clerk of Blackburn ; Mr. F. Ogden Whiteley, City Treasurer of Bradford ; and Mr. A. Goddard, O.B.E., Secretary to the Surveyors&apos; Institution.In the view of the Committee the recommendations set out below will constitute a satisfactory basis for the reform of the existing systems of valuation and rating in England and Wales, will arouse the minimum of opposition .in Parliament and in the country, and in particular will be found free from the objections which have&quot;been raised in Parliament to previous schemes of reform.The Committee recommend  That the Home Affairs Committee should advise the Cabinet (1) to give general approval to the following proposals ; and (2) to authorise their incorporation in a draft Bill to be prepared for the early consideration of the Home Affairs Committee.
Summary of Proposed Reforms.* I.  Valuation.1. One valuation of properties in place of three valuations.2. Steps to ensure uniform and correct principles of valuation by (a.) Transferring the original drafting from parochial officers to the councils of Boroughs and Districts. (&amp;.) Introducing assistance and supervision by officers of the Board of InlandRevenue.(c.) Entrusting the hearing of objections to Committees appointed jointly by County, Borough and District Councils.(d.) Regulating the scale of deductions in respect of repairs, insurance, &amp;c.(e.) Referring &quot;special properties&quot; (railways, &amp;c.) to a Central Valuation Body appointed by the Minister of Health from persons nominated by the Associations of Local Authorities, with an appeal.3. Periodical revision of the valuation lists.4. Simplification and acceleration of the valuation procedure.II. Rating.1. Abolition of parochial rating. 2. Unification of rates.These two reforms, for which the demand is such as to produce a stream of local legislation, taken together (a.) Give about 500 rural rating bodies instead of 12,860, and about 1,261 urbanrating bodies instead of 3,000. (b.) Give one rating body in place of two or more in each town, (c.) Give one rate in place of two or more in many districts. (d.) Simplify rating and rate collection.(e.) Simplify the accounts and returns of all local authorities. (/.) Clear the way for better and more reliable statistics.3. A reform of rating precepts which removes the long-standing objection that common charges now involve by no means even rating in the areas concerned.This reform, which also simplifies account-keeping, is only possible where the valuation system has been made uniform.4. Several minor rating reforms.Valuation and Rating Reform (England and Wales).1. Up till now valuation and rating have been attached chiefly to the Poor Law areas and Poor Law authorities. This is the result of the practice which the Legislature adopted in the past of engrafting on the Poor Law system other Local Government powers and of using the Poor Law machinery to do general Local Government work. It follows that any scheme of Poor Law Reform which proceeds on the lines of transferring the functions of the Poor Law bodies to other hands would necessarily involve a reconstruction of the machinery of Valuation and Rating.2. On the other hand, there is no need to postpone the introduction of Valuation and Rating Reform until Poor Law Reform has been undertaken. The existing valuation and rating systems present several long-standing claims for reform, some of which are at least- as urgent as, and can be dealt with quite independently of, Poor Law Reform. These claims are being strongly pressed at the present time by representative associations of local authorities,  and it is highly  desirable  that  they  should be  dealt* For table comparing main outlines of recommendations of 1901, 1914 and 1921, see Appendix.
with in any case. Except in one connection, the main lines of these reforms appear to be fully agreed. With the exception referred to, viz., the rating of site values, it is not proposed to&apos; deal, but it will be observed that the simplifications of rating machinery which are suggested would make the way clearer in the event of a decision to deal with site values. Moreover, the provision of uniform valuation and the unification of rate funds prepare the way for introducing an improved system of distributing Exchequer grants.3. On the side of valuation the most authoritative recommendations have been made in favour of a radical alteration of the present system. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his letter of the 13th November, 1912, to Sir John Kempe, the Chairman of the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation, both political parties have frequently introduced Valuation Bills, and, since the Eoyal Commission on Local Taxation reported, Valuation Bills were also promised in the King&apos;s Speeches of 1905 and 1908. It may be added that the scheme for the readjustment of local taxation, which was embodied in the Government Bill of 1914, was contingent upon the introduction of a new and uniform system of valuation (which included separate treatment of site values).4. On the side of rating the claims are fully as urgent, and in this case it is by the ratepayers in general and by the local authorities that they are being pressed. There is abundant evidence of the general desire for a simpler and more efficient system. In a good many cases a reduction in the number of rating authorities or a unification of rates has been effected on&quot; local initiative. In some cases statutory authority is needed, and no less than twelve Local Bills for this purpose have been before Parliament in each of the last two sessions. There are strong reasons for expecting an increased claim upon Parliamentary time in this connection, and appeals for general legislation to effect the reforms are being made.I. Valuation.Present A rrangements.5. All the original work of listing and valuing properties for rating purposes is at present done by the overseers or their paid assistants, and a separate valuation list is made for each of the 14,600 Poor Law parishes. Objections to the valuations so made are heard1 by the Assessment Committees of 616 Poor Law Unions, and of twenty cities and boroughs in London, and appeals from their decision may be made to Quarter Sessions, and thence on a point of law to the High Court. In London quinquennial revaluation has been required since 1869, but elsewhere it rests with the Assessment Committee to determine when a new list shall be made.6. Professional valuers are sometimes employed by the overseers or Assessment Committees, and in a few of the largest towns there are whole-time valuers. It is chiefly for dealing with such properties as railways, mines, docks, canals, public utility concerns, licensed premises and large manufacturing and business premises that professional assistance is called in.7. A separate valuation of properties (other than railways, mines and certain other special properties of that kind) is made by the Inland Revenue authorities for purposes of income tax schedule A and inhabited house duty. This valuation does not, however, extend to the Metropolis, in which since 1869 a single valuation list has been made to serve both rate and tax purposes.8. A third valuation is made by a committee of each County Council (except London). The County Councils have no power of levying rates directly; but they work out the share of their estimated expenditure which is to be borne by each parish, using for the purpose of these apportionments the county rate basis, i.e., the lists of parish valuation totals settled by the committees referred to above. These County Committees may adopt the rate valuations or may make new valuations, and they are empowered to call for the production of any documents relating to the value of properties, to summon and examine any persons and to ,make use of the tax assessment lists. As a matter of fact, they all make separate valuations, using the schedule A tax assessments as their chief guide in most cases.9. The want of uniformity in the valuations upon which the rates are actually levied comes out very strongly on a comparison with the county rate basis; the totals of the rate valuation lists vary from 40 per cent..under to 10 per cent, over the totals settled by the County Committees.
Heads of Proposals. 1. One Valuation for all Purposes.10. The separate valuations at present required duplicate work and occasion unnecessary complications, and great advantage would be secured, along with considerable saving in expense, if one valuation could serve for all purposes.11. The reformed valuation now proposed, though designed primarily for rating purposes, will be available for purposes of income tax schedule A and inhabited house duty, and can be adopted for these purposes under appropriate provisions in a subsequent Finance Bill. It has long been generally accepted that, upon a reform of valuation for rating being instituted, the new valuation list should be used both for rating and for tax purposes. It would be available also (where needed) for the calculation of Exchequer grants, for which purpose a uniform system of valuation is highly desirable.2. Machinery to secure Proper and Uniform Valuation.12. The practice at present followed in preparing the rate valuations varies widely. Where local rating is concerned uniformity within the area affected suffices, but when a valuation is to be used for purposes of national taxation it is obviously desirable to secure uniformity throughout the country. Moreover, the amount which a rate produces in a county or district is already a factor of considerable importance in the calculation of Exchequer grants (e.g., Education and Housing grants), and it will probably become a more important factor.13. Correct valuation of individual properties must also be secured, and this often requires technical skill which is not possessed by the Overseers or by the Assessment Committees. It is not only in respect of the special properties referred to above (railways, &amp;c.) that skilled valuation is needed, it is needed also for many ordinary properties which are occupied by the owners or for some special reasons let at rents which do not correspond with market value. And it is bad economy to allow the parishes (either singly or in combination with other parishes) to&apos; call in professional firms from time to time. Moreover, where properties such as railways and canals which extend into a number of different rating &quot;areas are concerned, it is obviously desirable that the work of valuation should be centralised.14. The following amendments are proposed with a view to securing a uniform and correct valuation : (i.) Reduction in the number of Valuation Areas.The original work of preparing valuation lists and of valuing ordinary properties should be transferred from the Overseers of the 14,600 Poor Law parishes to the Councils of the Boroughs, Urban Districts and Rural Districts (numbering about 1,800 in all). (These Councils would be the only rating bodies of the future, and Overseers of the Poor would no longer be appointed.)This would place all the original work in fewer and much more efficient hands. Such paid assistants of the Overseers as are capable of doing good work would probably obtain extended employment under the new rating authorities.(ii.) A more competent Court of First Instance. .15. The work of the Union Assessment Committees should be transferred, in the cases of County and Metropolitan Boroughs to Committees appointed by the Borough Councils, and in other cases to Committees appointed jointly by the Councils of the Counties and of the Boroughs and Districts concerned.16. It is proposed to give the County Council (1.) Powers to frame schemes of grouping districts for the consideration of the Minister of Health, who will consider objections raised to- such schemes and be authorised to hold such enquiries as he may think necessary or desirable, before giving his final decision.(2.) The right to be represented on all Assessment Committees, the areas of which contribute to the County rates.(3.) The power to appeal against the valuations.
This will give the County Council full opportunity for exercising such supervision of the work as is desirable. It is thought that these changes combined with the assistance of the Officers of the Inland Revenue (referred to below) would provide competent and convenient courts of first instance possessed of the necessary local knowledge. The changes would probably be satisfactory to the County Authorities, without occasioning any objection on the part of the minor authorities.17. The representatives of the County Councils&apos; Association who attended recently at the Ministry of Health made out a very strong case as to the need for transferring the duty of hearing and determining objections from the purely local Assessment Committees to committees of wider outlook, and, if possible, better personnel.(iii.) Appeals from Assessment Committees.18. It is proposed that while appeals from Assessment Committees to Special Sessions should be abolished, Quarter Sessions should be retained as the appellant Tribunal. Quarter Sessions should in every case be empowered to set up a special ad hoc Tribunal from among its members, this Tribunal to be treated as Quarter Sessions, e.g., no appeal to lie from it to Quarter Sessions. In every case the Chair-man of the ad hoe Tribunal should be a person possessed of legal qualifications.(iv.) Uniform Scale of Allowances for Repairs, Insurance, &amp;c.19. The want of uniformity in the present system of valuation for rating purposes is largely due to- local variations in the scale of allowances for repairs, insurance, &amp;c. In London there is a statutory scale of deductions prescribed by the Third.Schedule of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, and the Royal Commission on Local-Taxation recommended that legislation should provide for the establishment of a maximum scale of deductions for the rest of the country. It is proposed that the Bill should include a provision prescribing a scale of allowances applicable throughout the country.(v.) The part to the played by the Crown.20. This is a matter in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is of course very closely and indeed primarily-concerned. The Crown, it is suggested, should play a twofold part (a.) In giving certain practical assistance to the rating authorities in connection with the valuation and in giving similar assistance to the Central Body concerned with the valuation of special properties (railways, &amp;c).(&amp;.) In exercising a check upon the valuation (comparable to that now exercised in the Metropolis) as being a valuation ultimately to be used for tax as well as for rate purposes.In the following paragraphs these two aspects are examined separately : 21. Practical assistance to the Rating Authority. It wall be recalled that the staff of the Board of Inland Revenue embraces a Valuation Office which undertakes, among other functions, valuation work for other Government Departments and (within certain defined limits) for local authorities. It may be anticipated that many local Rating Authorities (other than those which maintain a&apos; whole-time professional staff) will be glad to avail themselves of the services of the Valuation Office acting in the capacity of professional surveyors in the compilation of the Valuation List.   It is proposed That the Rating Authority (i.e., the Borough, Urban or Rural District Council) should be at liberty, if the Board of Inland Revenue agree, to make use of the services of a valuer in the service of the Board to act as its professional adviser in the preparation of the Valuation List or any part thereof; and that in such cases the Rating Authority should be charged a suitable fee for the services rendered.
()22. The Crown check upon the Valuation. As has been indicated abovq, it is contemplated that the new Valuation List will be used not only for rating purposes, but for purposes of income tax schedule &quot;A&quot; and inhabited house duty. The interest of the Crown in the Valuation List being thus very large, it is essential that the Crown should exercise an effective check; the officers of the Board of Inland Revenue should be entitled to examine or cross-examine the persons who appear before the Valuation Committee, to suggest corrections in the Valuation List, and, where necessary, to be a party to an appeal to Quarter Sessions.23. It is proposed that the procedure at present in force in the Metropolis (under which the Inspector of Taxes, as representing the Crown, may put forward figures differing from the values on the draft Valuation List, but, if his figures are not adopted by the Assessment Committee, he cannot enforce them though he may proceed by way of formal objection) should be extended to the whole of England and Wales, subject to the following modifications which are necessary to secure the Crown check upon the valuation :  .(a.) Statutory provision should be made that, in cases where the District Authority do not utilise the services of an Inland Revenue Valuer as its professional adviser under the provisions set out in paragraph 21, the Inland Revenue officer should be heard and consulted by the District Authority in connection with the initial preparation of the Valuation List. This would give general statutory effect to an arrangement which has grown up in practice in several London Boroughs with very advantageous results.(p.) The period (28 days) which under the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, is allowed to the Inland Revenue officer for examining the list and inserting his estimate of the gross value of any hereditaments for which his estimate differs from that inserted by the Rating Authority should be extended sufficiently to give the Department time to review the list.(c.) The interest of the Crown should be represented on the Assessment Committees by the inclusion in those Committees of two General Commissioners of Taxes.[d) The officers of the Board of Inland Revenue should have the right to be present and to be heard at the hearing of objections by the Assessment Committee (i.e., the body appointed to hear objections against the values appearing in the Valuation List after deposit).24. Attention is drawn to the following recommendation in paragraph 434 (b) of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Income Tax : &quot;Another case of under-assessment occurs when properties are let on rentals in excess of the schedule &apos; A &apos; assessment. This question is one which is apt to arise especially in connection with licensed premises, and with houses in London, where fancy rents are not uncommon. Under the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 186,9, the schedule &apos; A&apos; assessment follows the Poor Rate Valuation, which is made on what is assumed to be the normal rental. We recommend that these excess rents should also be chargeable on the owner under Case 6 of schedule &apos; D.&apos; &quot;Legislation, in this sense, will be an important safeguard for the Crown against loss of revenue due to under-valuation in the new Valuation Lists, and it is desirable that the Royal Commission^ recommendation should receive early statutory sanction.(vi.) Valuation of Special Properties.25, Definition of Special Properties. Special Properties should be defined so as to include all railways, canals and tramways, and all water, gas and electricity undertakings extending into the areas of more than one Rating Authority or owned by a Rating Authority.26. Valuation of Special Properties. It is contemplated that Special Properties, as defined in the preceding paragraph, should not fall under the foregoing general provisions for valuation by the Rating Authority, but that each Special Property
should be specially valued as a whole by a Central Body to be constituted in the manner described in the following paragraph, except in those cases in which the Rating Authority and the County Council agree that they may be valued locally under the general provisions of valuation; cases in which those&apos;Authorities fail to agree to be referred for decision to the Minister of Health, who would also have power to require valuation by a Central Body, if he is satisfied that there is good ground: for such action. -27. The Central Body to be set up for valuing Special Properties, other than those which are valued locally, should consist of, say, ten members, to be appointed by the Minister of Health on the nomination of the Associations of the chief classes of Local Authorities, e.g., the County Councils&apos; Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils&apos; Association, the Rural District Councils&apos; Association, and possibly the Association of Poor Law Unions. The members of this body to be unpaid. The body to be at liberty, if the Board of Inland Revenue agreed, to make use, on payment of a special fee for the services rendered, of the services of valuers in the employment of the Board, to act as its professional advisers in the valuation of Special Properties. The Central Bpdy also to be at liberty to employ a paid staff of professional valuers and accountants. The whole charge would be borne by the Rating Authorities, on whose behalf the valuations are made.28. This technical work, which-requires expert knowledge, can be performed to much better advantage by valuers who are continually employed upon it than by leaving it to local effort and to the professional valuers who are called in from time to time. It is clearly work which should be centralised and done as a whole, as some of the properties extend into many valuation areas, Moreover, a. whole-time staff would not only do the work at less cost, but would also follow more settled and uniform principles, and -this would tend to reduce the number of costly appeals.29. The inclusion of public utility properties in the list of *&apos; special properties &quot; thus valued removes the objection that entrusting valuation to Borough and District Councils will leave them the valuers of their own trading properties.30. Appeals from local valuations should go to Quarter Sessions, but appeals against valuations made by the Central Body should, subject to the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, go to the Railway and Canal Commission and thence on points of law to the High Court.31. Opportunities should be afforded to enable Special Properties to be valued more frequently than quinquennially; at the same time, safeguards should be provided against vexatious claims for unnecessarily frequent revaluations of properties of this character.32. It may be mentioned that the representatives of the County Councils&apos; Association, who recently attended to lay their views on these questions before the Ministry of Health and Board of Inland Revenue, strongly urged the adoption of some such system for the central valuation of Special Properties as that&quot; set out in this section of the memorandum and illustrated the need for it in a very forcible manner.3. Periodical Revision of the Lists.33. The lists to be renewed every five years.The system of allowing the Assessment Committee to determine when a new list is needed has not worked well, and in many cases the lists are now thirty years old or more. The quinquennial revision ordained for London has given general satisfaction for fifty years.4. Simplifying and Speeding-up Procedure.34. Several unnecessary complications and delays in the procedure for revising valuations and for bringing new and altered properties into valuation should be removed.II. Rating.35. The simplification and improvements which it is proposed to introduce in the machinery of rating are of equal if not greater importance. That they will be generally welcomed there can be little doubt, seeing that the chief amendments proposed have been already introduced in a number of cases upon local initiative.36. We use a rating system which has been built up by over 300 years of legislation and still depends largely upon the Poor Relief Act of 1601.  It is now so
involved and complicated, so unnecessarily subdivided and duplicated, and in many respects so inefficient as to make it a matter of wonder that revision has been so long delayed.37. The normal arrangements outside the Metropolis.for meeting the expendi-ture of local authorities falling upon the rates were summarised by the Kempe Committee as follows : &quot; The expenses of guardians and overseers, of County Councils, of Rural District Councils (on highways and general expenses) and of Parish Councils (on general parochial services), are charged upon the poor rate.&quot; The expenses of Borough Councils on roads, sanitary services, &amp;c, and the expenses generally of Urban District Councils, are paid out of the general district rate. In a few boroughs, however, the highway and sanitary expenditure is defrayed from the borough fund and rate. Expenditure of Urban District Councils&apos;for education purposes is met from the&quot; poor rate by precept upon the overseers. In some districts separate highway rates are levied and also private improvement rates.&quot; The other expenses of Borough Councils are either charged upon the borough rate, which may be part of the poor rate, or, in some cases, as regards police expenses, by means of a watch rate.&quot; Expenditure of Rural District Councils for sewerage, water supply and other matters, which are charged on particular contributory places as special expenses, is met by a special expenses rate, and expenditure of Parish Councils on lighting by a lighting rate.&quot; Of these various rates, the poor rate, the special expenses rate, and the lighting rate are leviable by the overseers; the general district rate, the watch rate and the borough rate, where separate from the poor rate, are leviable by the Borough or Urban District Council and collected by their own officers.&quot;The Proposed Reforms. 1. Reduction in the Number of Rating Authorities.38. A separate rating authority (the overseers) is still appointed annually in each Poor Law Parish.A hundred years ago over 90 per cent, of local expenditure was borne parochially, and naturally rating had also to be parochial, but one class of expenditure after another has been transferred to larger areas, and since the Education Act of 1902 there has been no real need of parochial rating, as the small remnant of &quot;expenditure which is still borne parochially in the rural areas can be charged precisely as it now is when rating has been transferred to the District Councils.39. Except in a few of the larger towns where the ratepayers have been specially relieved of this useless cost and annoyance, each urban area is still rated by two or more rating authorities (i.e., the Urban District Council and the Overseers of the Parish or Parishes contained in the area), employing separate staffs and making separate demands upon each ratepayer.40. Under the scheme now proposed there would be but one rating authority in each district, viz., the Council of the district, and the number of rating authorities would thus be reduced from 12,870 to about 500 in the rural areas, and from over 3,000 to 1,261 in the urban areas, and the rating authority will in every case be a spending authority.2. The Unification and Simplification of Rates.41. Many of the complications which now attach to rate making and rate collection have their origin in the fact that Parliament, in granting reliefs to different classes of property at different times, has directed that effect shall be given to these reliefs in the collection of the rates and not in the calculation of the rateable values of the properties concerned; and these complications are seriously aggravated by the fact that several of the reliefs have been attached specifically to some new rating burden which Parliament was at the time imposing.42. Thus in 1833 the Lighting and Watching Act decreed that a defined list of properties should pay only upon one-third of the respective rateable values towards the burdens which it imposed, and this involved the making of a separate rate and the keeping of a separate set of accounts in each parish where the Act was put in opera nun.   ^igctiii, m xoru liic x uuiic jjlocwlijii -nut ucciccu i/nau a, buu.it/wnau uiuerem
list of properties should pay only on a quarter of their respective rateable values towards the expenses which came under the Act.  This has involved every Urban i area and many Rural Parishes in the making of separate rates and the keeping of separate sets of accounts.43. The attachments of rating reliefs to defined sections of local expenditure have become so confused that no set purpose or design can now be said to govern them. It may be that at the dates of their origin there was intention to reflect in the contribution of the several classes of property the difference in benefits received, but the existing facts are such that it would be impossible to support the continuance of I the arrangement on this ground.44. The sections of expenditure to which the reliefs apply differ widely in different districts. Each of these sectional reliefs occasions the making of a separate rate and the keeping of a separate fund account.  Strong recommendations to abolish these attachments have been made, and local authorities are being allowed (without I opposition) to put through Bills which spread the reliefs at revised percentages over I all their own headings of expenditure.45. It is obviously undesirable that each town should be left to make its own I rating law in this way, and to propound local schemes for governing the proportions I in which each class of property is to be assessed.46. It is accordingly proposed to calculate a scale of reliefs which will give in I one general rate the same result as is produced by the special reliefs which operate in 1 the separate rates. But when this has been done it is not by allotting a different I column in the rate book and a different rate in the pound to each class of property 1 that the scale should take effect; it should operate in deducing the values upon which I the rates are actually to be levied. It is only in this way that the simplification of I rate collection, which is so desirable, can be attained.47. Reliefs. The following schedule of equated reliefs is based upon existing I j statistical material and deals with the only two classes of property of which it 1 appears necessary to take special account in general legislation, viz. :  (i.) The railway group, including canals, forests, land covered with water, &amp;c.I (ii.) Agricultural land and tithes.With a view to securing simplicity in the scheme of equated reliefs the proposed&quot; figures have been converted into whole numbers the figures in brackets are the estimated existing average reliefs : 	Urban Areas.	Rural Areas.Railways, &amp;c. Agricultural land and tithe-;	Per cent. 30   (30) 60   (59-6)	Per cent. 5   (5-2) 50   (51-2)It is believed that this schedule will be acceptable to the rating authorities with very few exceptions, and to all groups of ratepayers, except the agricultural ratepayers in those rural parishes where special sanitary rates are being levied. To meet these particular cases it is suggested that the County Councils should be. empowered to make temporary variations subject to statutory limitations as to period and as to amount., 48. It will have been seen that at present often two and sometimes more rates are being levied in the same parish. The reforms just described render it possible to substitute a single rate of the simplest design for the several rates of more or less complex design which are now being levied, and to unify all the rate funds of each town or district.49. It is proposed that any parish property adjustments which may be necessitated by these reforms should be determined by the County Councils, and that the District Auditors should deal with* financial adjustments in relation to parish balances.3. The Simplification of A ccounts.50. The simplification of accounts which would follow from the reduction in the number of rating authorities and the unification of rates are improvements of very great importance to the local authorities and to the ratepayers.  The account-keeping
work of each borough, county, rural district and joint authority would be materially simplified, and the published results would be much clearer. Great difficulties, which at present arise on the compilation of statistics and detract from their value, would be removed.4. Reformed Basis of Precepts.51. At present all the spending authorities are required to apportion their expenditures according to the rateable values of the parishes to which they are chargeable, and to call for contributions to meet these apportionments.52. It is proposed that all precepts shall in future be for the produce of a rate of defined poundage, instead of for defined amounts of money. This simple amencl-ment would remove a real grievance which often gives rise to justifiable complaints.53. Expenditure common to an area, the burden of which is supposed to be equally distributed, may at present give rise to rating of different amounts in the pound in different parts&apos;of the area, because the rateable values upon which, it is portioned out are by no means uniformly productive. Even in large cases the rating for expenditure common to the whole area has varied by over a shilling in the pound, and a small parish with half its rateable value unproductive may have to pay for equal service twice as much in the pound as its neighbours.54. The present system also causes much useless work, and the amount and complication of this work has been greatly increased by the decision of the Courts to the effect that reapportionment may be claimed in any case where a valuation is reduced on an appeal which was lodged before the date of the apportionment. Thus any of the precepting authorities may now be called upon to revise the whole of their expenditure apportionment for one or more of their closed accounts, and to make an adjustment of account with every parish in their area.55. The present system induces delay in the valuation of new and altered properties, from which considerable loss results. The transfer of rate collection work to competent bodies which are all largely interested in the income collected, is a fair guarantee that the reformed system would not give rise to lax collection. Indeed, there is much reason to believe that rate collection will be considerably more complete under the scheme herein proposed.56. These rating reforms are undoubtedly long overdue, and there are certain minor amendments which it would be well to include in the Bill.57. It wall be. noted that, in so far as. the Assessment Committees and the overseers are concerned, the changes which are proposed are unavoidable, if Poor Law reform is to proceed; and that, in so far as other local bodies are concerned, their autonomy is preserved and the importance of their functions is in no case curtailed, while in some cases it is materially enhanced.58. Under the new proposals the valuation and the rating work would be performed at every stage by a comparatively limited number of trained men instead of by a multitude of parochial officers.59. Considerable reduction of work would be effected, and there would be material saving of cost in the aggregate.(Signed)        EDWARD SHORTT, Chairman.R. B. Howorth, Secretary.2,.
