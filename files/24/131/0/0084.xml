That Committee had before them the conclusions on this subject of the Oversea Settlement Committee., which may be briefly sv-isoo&amp;rised as follows-The immediate relief which Oversea Settlement oan afford to unemployment at any particular moment is strictly limited by -the capacity of the Dominions to absorb new population., Oversea settlement cannot, t her of ore., be regarded as a sub-stitute for other emergency measures in a crisis, but only -as a-complementary measure..   As such, however, it has-the great advantage that, within the limit of the numbers -affected,, the relief is real -and lasting for the individual., the cost moderate, and the permanent results upon the economic situation beneficial both-.i.-by easing the pressure upon the labour market here and by strengthening our best markets overseas..    It was pointed out that,, though no condition as to unemployment or lack of means was attached to the grant of free passage to ex-Service men and women, some 70 per cent of those who went were actually unemployed or in casual employment - while of the remainder few did not or^&amp;te vacancies for fresh employment by their departure..   .The cost of these passages., averaging about  26 a head., was shown to compare favourably with the cost per head. &amp; ... .* * *
head of relief work or of long periods of unemployment benefit.    It was suggested, however, that from the point of view of relieving unemployment some supplementary assistance beyond the ex-Service free passages was desirable because many of those who might be most benefited were unable to accept the free passages, as they could not provide, the necessary minimum-of outfit or money on landing, or were not qualified by war service.The Unemployment Committee.; accepted these conclusions and put forward the following recommendations which, were accepted by the Cabinet on Dec ember. 6 th 1920 :-&quot;(a) That the time for receiving applications from ex-Seryioe men and women for free passages should be extended for one year. (i.e. to December 31st 1921);(b) That grants in aid of settlement-. within -.the Empire should be placed at-the disposal, of the Oversea Settlement Committee,  in. so far as they may prove, to be required, at a . rate not exceeding  50,000 a month from.. January 1st 1921 to March 31st 1921, with a preference to ex-Service men;(c) That the Colonial Office, after negotiation...: with the Dominions, should formulate a- scheme of assisted emigration on a large scale for , submission to the Cabinet.MAs regards .the free- passages there has been a very -marked increase, in the application- for tnese, particularly for Australia, during the ,last few months, due to the increase in unemployment coinciding with an improvement
in &quot;shipping facilities and a more active immigration policy on the part of the Commonwealth Government.   This increase, unless checked, will probably involve an expenditure of from  300,000 -  350.000 over the original estimate of  670,000 for &quot;free passages for the current financial year.    We are in any case under a pledge to ex-Service&apos; men in respect of these passages&apos;,    But I would strongly urge, &apos; from the point of view 61 unemployment, that, so far from endeavouring to check the movement, we&quot;should encourage it up to the limit of&apos; the &apos;numbers which the Dominions&apos; are prepared to taW.&quot;As regards &quot;the supplementary grants it was found that not more than  25,000 a month could be usefully spent in the first three months of 1921.    In view of&quot;the need for economy this was still further cut down and only about  7,500 a, month was spent up to June 30th when the grants were stopped.    The grants were of real value in relieving eases where such relief was most needed, at a small cost per case, and I should be glad if the Cabinet Unemployment.Committee could recommend that the renewal of these giants, up to say  10,000 a month, might be favourably considered&quot; if applied for by the Oversea Settle -ment Committee.&quot;   At the present moment while migration to Canada is in abeyance, tfnd shipping to Australasia is likely to be filled by&quot; ex-Service men without such assistance, I think the supplementary grants can be dispensed with.General principles&apos;for the future co-operation of the Imperial and Dominion Governments in Oversea Settlement were formulated at a special .conference held -in February last, -the conclusions of which were formally endorsed by the Imperial Conference.    Schemes .. based , on- these conclusions could nottaite .......
take effect in time to influence ,the unemployment situation during tho corning winter,    But they will have a. very important effect oh &quot;the situation- next year and in subsequent years, and unless&apos; it is assumed that the unemployment problem will oeaso with the -present.year, it is very desirable that the necessary Parliamentary, powers should be secured, as recommend-r ed&apos; by the Imperial. Conference, to enter upon -negotiations with the Dominions, as soon as possible.    It will be remembered that the b&amp;this of any. such schemes will be that the Dominions contribute half tha. cost of any assistance towards passages, and &apos; substantially, more than half the cost of any schemes of land settlement.What I would particularly urge is the need for continuity of policy in this matter.   Nothing could be more ill-advised than to cut down or abandon, on.the plea of economy, the relief of unemployment,by means which have already proved themselves efficacious and by experienced administrators, and then to spend-much larger sums oh Schemes of relief which have still to be invented and carrisd oat by agents of doubtful - -zeal and&apos; capacity.   With continuity of policy on the other hand there is.no doubt that.,-an increasing degreeof co-operation will be. secured from the Dominion Governments,&apos;. \and that there will-be a progressive, increase in the numbers, which the Dominions can absorb at any one time.     The money spent-this year will.in that way not only assist in relieving -the immediate crisis but will strengthen our position for the future.29th September, 1921.(Sgd.) L.S. AMilRY.
