&apos;T IS THE PROPERTY OS1 HI 3 BRITA^TC MAJESTY1S GOvTBRJ-KENT) .C A 3-1 N E,TTURgEY; AND -IRAQfVPai%-\phras3 telegram from the High Commissioner cf Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 21s-t November .(Received, Colonial Office, 11.40 p.m., 23rd--November, 1921).Circulated by the Secretary.....of State for thePolonies .:tt.;With reference to your telegram No&apos;. 519 of 11th November..(l) I an dealing in this telegram only with inten-tion of Turkey on    Iraq.(2) There are at your disposal sources of information of which I am ignorant but I find it most difficult /to accept that Iraq is not an immediate Turkish objective which is what I gather your telegram is intended to convey. It is accepted that with Greeks pressing them Turks are bound to direct their main effort to Western front; it is accepted also that it Would be poor strategy for Angora to go to expense of open war at present juncture as Iraq obviously offers a fertile field for propaganda and as British troops are being evacuated in a   steady stream.    All the same, on evidence available to us Fei sal,   General Headquarters and I can arrive at no other conclusion (?) but that to extent practicable Turks are hostile to Iraq and as soon as moment seems favourable to them are prepared to break into open hostilities&apos;.(3) In addition to evidential factors reported in my earlier telegrams,  e&apos;.g&apos;. my telegram of 2nd June, 155, further evidence may be &apos;sujfimarised as follows&apos;.
(l) Persistent and definite signs of Turkish activity in Intelligence and propaganda within and on borders of Iraq which appear to include encouragement-of anti-Sunni prejudice or Shiahs and anti-Arab prejudices of -Kurds *   With these ends in view attention is&apos;being devoted to jealous element among priesthood of holy cities, and to pro-Turkish parties in Mosul,  duieimaniyah. and Baghdad.    One of.most dangerous mani-festations of these activities is attempt to arouse discon-tent in Arab Army through former Turkish officers.   Angora Government definitely allotted to Shirkh Ahiiied &apos;denussi the task of conducting anti-British propaganda in Iraq and Ajaimi who is still retained in Turkish pay and is chief - medium for passing on Eihad&apos;s agents is in communication with Senussi.    To secure co-operation in tribal forces on northern border for future offensive enterprise is without doubt one of chief purposes of this propaganda...   &apos;(2) Despatch of special missions see my views summary dated September 30th Mo ,;3 .D. 2575 Section 8 of paragraph 2 regarding Mahmuo Al Sanawi and my telegram ho.655 Ebver/Der 9th..(3) In Russianertpert opinion a provision for supply of arms by France for /Turkish aggression on Iraq was included in Bouillon agreement *   Whether such a provision exists or not there is significance in the fact that as regards Turkish objectives Russian mission at any rate hold&apos;- same view as. we in Iraq do. - . .. &apos;(.4) A recent report of reliable&quot; age nt. as sorts that in conversation during September Xiazim. Karabekir emphasised that claims of Angora Government to Kutessnrilig of1 Dair-as-Zor ana vilayet of Mosul were, intrinsic items, of .national policy which they would not abandon* &apos; Continuance of Turkish control of northern Kurdisiaav-he regarded as essentially, contingent upon possession of&quot;Mosul&quot;and both Mosul and Dair-a-z-Zor as necessary/&apos;. &quot;. - -  v. ad :eco noni ca1ly/

While T agree that- it is n of time to give the Kurds any encouragement, I trust they, may he kept in play and instructions -accordingly issued to those of His !la-&apos;esty&apos;s representatives abroad-&apos;who nay be concerned.    tUte will want every possible assistance should present negotiations also with Turkey break down. Meanwhile Fhalil is leaving Iraq and R afrit  is returning to Constantinople^COX.
