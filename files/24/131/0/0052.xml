He had not &quot;been ahie to
circulate the papers earlier as the whole situation tended to change from day to day. Recent events had, however, led the best expert opinion to the conclusion that Germany would be unable to pay the January and February instalments without financial assistance. As a result of the recent visit of the Reparation Commission to Berlin, Sir John Bradbury had formed a definite view that Germany would be unable to meet the coming obligations and it was clear that if Germany was to default the effect on the whole of Europe would be a disaster of a most appalling character, the consequences of which no man could estimate. The effect in Great Britain would be very serious. In the City of London the Accepting Houses would stand to lose £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 mainly in respect of wheat and cotton transactions which London had been financing for German importers. In this connection it should be noted that in recent months German imports from Great Britain had substantially exceeded the latters imports from Germany.

During the last few days he, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had had several interviews with Herr Rathenau and had been very favourably impressed with his strength of character, ability, and his genuine desire to do the best he could for Germany.  Herr Rathenau was of opinion that if Germany defaulted, France would proceed to occupy the Ruhr and this would produce a complete collapse in Germany. Herr Rathenau would only be prepared to resume office in the German Government if he could see some sign of hope, and he could see none unless Germany was given immediate financial help.
He had suggester that Germany should be allowed to raise a loan in London and New York ?sured by a mortgage on the German customs, but after speaking to representatives of British financial interests he was very doubtful whether such a loan should be raised. The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that while the City would be most unwilling to find money for such a purpose, this night be arranged if an assurance could be given that the financial poistion of Germany would be rehabilitated in the near future. The City at the moment would, he thought, welcome the abandonment of German reparation payments and would certainly strongly support a moratorium for a period sufficient to enable Germany to recover.

It seemed clear that France would resolutely object to any propooals of this character and particularly to any suggestion for an immediate moraterium in advance of the January and February instalments. It would, no doubt, be possible to put pressure upon the French Government and he indicated a way in which this could he done.

The Committee should bear in mind that all the most reliable experts took the view that Germany must default unless assisted. At the same time the situation contained certain puzzling elements, for example, in spite of great pressure on her to export, Germany today was actuallu exporting 25% of her  pre-war exports.

This was  no doubt, due to various considerations such as the reduction in the number and productive capacity of German workmen, the lose of Alsace Lorraine and Upper Silesia and also to the need for spending large sums on repairs and renewals of material
in Germany.    At the same time it was clear that if Germany wanted to deceive the Allies in the matter of reparation she might arrange for a Gkmrimcnt default accompanied by substantial benefits to her people in the shape.of subsidies on bread, railways, coal, etc. To meet this point he had Informed Here Rathnnau that any moratorium&apos; wftuldrhe conditional on the German Government making receipts balance expenditure^ on that Government slowing down sand ultimately stopping tho printing of mar^s and on a complete and immediate cessation of.all subsidies.Herr Rattenau had stated that he was in favour of getting rid of subsidies and would agree to tire proposal to slow down and ultimately to stop the printing of marks, hut it would bo difficult to make the Gorman Budget balance as tho necessary&quot; increased&apos;..taxation would weigh Y.ery heavily on the middle classes.     He had been reminded that the ruin of the German middle classes was mainly being accomplished by the depreciation of the mark*In conclusion the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Committee that the whole question of the moratorium would bo for the Reparation Commission to settle and that if a majority of the Members of the Cammissioxa were in favour of a moratorium, effect could be given to the proposal even if France maintained her objections.     He undertook to circulate papers to the Committee forthwith.Tho Lord Privy Seal enquired what was the present position as regards the &quot;Cold Storage&quot; bills, and also what exactly tho Reparation Commission had done as a result of thoir recent visit to Berlin,
Tho Chancellor;-of the Exchequer? replied that out. of fi. total cf  300,000,000. of Cold Storage bill * all except about  14,000, XO including into rest h d been cleared off. This t*a&apos;s a most satisfactory result of the gr^at experiment, and the City vas most grateful to those Ministers who had Initiated and carried out the scheme.As regards the outstanding bills, it was very desirable that -some further, time should bo given - the Government could afford tc be generous in the matter.T?.&apos;.th regard to the position on the Reparation Commission, it ?;&amp;s probable that at the moment a majority of the members held the viev; that Germany could pay the January and February Instalments.: .Sir John Bradbury, however, was clear that such payment could not be mf.de unless the &quot;German Government borrowed the money In London.The Secretary of State- for India pointed out that Belgium 7;ould, in fact, got most of the January and February instalments by reason cf her priority, and he doubted whether It would be Vilse to put pressure upon the City to find money for Belgium, particularly when the vhole Empire vas in need of any money that could be raised in London.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that unless financial assistance &quot;as forthcoming Germany must default vith the most disastrous consequences to   all concerned.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he vras most anxious that the Government should proceed tilth the greatest caution in this mt-tter.     Ho drev: attention to a telegram, Wo,913 from Lord HardInge dated;30th November 1921, in - rfclch&apos; reference,&apos; tfas made/
tc the grerart anxiety tali, lr. Parla-xrvg^the^ciii-icus^ionp in London..    He, iora Curaon^ had Just seen the French Ambassador and had had a very satisfactory discussion with him about Angora,    The French Ambassador had made , no complaint on the subject of the discussions with Herr Stinnof and Herr Rathnau but ma anxious to know exactly what tho British Government intended to propose.    In this connection reference was mado to a serious leakage of Information &quot;Which had taken place and the Obommittoe agreed t-Tq request the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draw the attention ef the person named by him to the very injurious consequences of according interviews to London Press correspondents and to request him to abstain fran so doing in future.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that every effort should be made to carry the French Government in this matter, and, if necessary, to offer her compensation  in other directions in exchange for Pranceassenting to the proposed moratorium.    He entirely agreed with the action which had been taken in the direction of sounding Italy and Belgium on the subject, and he strongly urged that there should be an Inter-Allied Conference on the subject\ or at any rate, that the whole qiostlon should be discussed with the French Ministors before any definite decision was tIn i?*e course of the following discussion reference was made, to the serious situation which would arise if it was found impossible to secure a majority on the Reparation Commission for the moratorium proposals, and also if j having secursd such a majority with Franoe dissenting, Germany was then to default;     In this connection reference was-made tc the fact that under the Treaty of Versailles it wa3 open oo Great Britain to
^retire fron -the Reparation Commission on givingsix months jsetlce.     Reference was also made to the-pre^eirt flnanoial position of Prance which shewed e i^u^tani.lal improvement this year over last year.The suggestion was made that in order to pU3^ohje.sevJ?rench assent Great Britain might forego some of the benefits under the Inter-Allied Agree-ment of 15th August last.     It was also suggested that if the United States of America could be per-persuaded to assist, some arrangement might be made oh the lines of Great Britain and the United States surrendering to France and BelgiAm^e-spe^rtively equal amounts of French-bills, he Id by the two creditor Governments. .0n the other hand, it was contended that Great Britain should vis-a-vis the United States, maintain her hold on the French debt, and that our position in America would not be improved by making proposals for cancellation of the French debt at the present time. ... It was also urged that It would be unwise to give up any advantages which had accrued to Great Britain under the August AgroG-mont, particularly as that Agree-meat had not yet been ratified by the French Govern-^.ment.The Committee agreed :-To adjourn the further consideration   * of the &quot;question until a meeting to - be held early next week, and to Request the Chancellor of.the Exchequer.to circulate full papers to the. Committee in the. Interval, v

He, Sir R^Jtarna thad *?U0Ld3SES^te^amMlriff S the- psrKrp-o^&amp;ed c^vnverOT&amp;kons with M.. -Lcueheur and he had raised no objection to the procedure and quite recognised that in this matter the Allies would act together.The Committee were then informed that a telegram had just been received from Paris to the effect that K* L^ucheur had received, instructionr; to proceed to London to discuss the situation with the British Kinisters and it was&apos;urged that it would be most, undesirable for a meeting to take place,.without the representatives of Belgium and Italy particularly in as much as Belgium wan entitled under her priority to the major portion of the January and February instalments and was at present understood to be assuming a very uncompromising attitude towards the proposed mora-toriurn.   On the other hand it was represented that it was of prime importance that in the first instance the whole question should be con-sidered by the Chancellor cf the Exchequer, 1.. Louchsur andHwr Rathenau who would&apos;be able to survey the entire field muoh more satisfactorily if Belgium and Italy were absent.Reference Was made to the&apos; French view that the German industrialists had accumulated  250 millions of foreign credit abroad which should be made&quot; available for reparation payments.Herr Rathenau had however explained that the German industrialists haa not got raore than enough foreign credit- to finance their own industries and that any compulsory seizure of their credits would sizaply result in Gorman 3/ejaigr a ting . to those countries -where their credits were situated.The Finance Commi-btee agreed:-That the proposed Conference should be limited in the first instance to British Ministers., M. Loucheur andHaar-Rathenau and that arrangements should be made t-ct, secure the attendance of Belgium and Italian representatives as and when necessary.
