a0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; g GOVERNMENT) ET.CABINET. - JE^9. J&quot;THE EMBARGO OH CANADIAN&apos; STORE CATTLE.&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I desire to bring before the Cabinet the question of the proposed removal of the embargo on Canadian Store Cattle, upon which the Royal Commission, presided over by Lord Einlay, has recently made a report.     The Commission has in very guarded and somewhat inconclusive terms recommended the removal of the embargo, and the Canadian Government and certain persons in this country, including some large graziers chiefly from Scotland., representatives of the wholesale and retail meat traders, and members of Co-operative Societies, are urging the Government to introduce legislation in the coming Session.     I lately received a deputation from the Eree Importation of Canadian Cattle Association of Great Britain who strongly supported such a course of action.On the other hand, I am bound to inform the Cabinet that the proposed measure will certainly meet with the most determined opposition from agriculturists of all classes in England and Wales. It is difficult as a rule to gauge the views of farmers, since they usually differ among themselves as acutely as the members of an Irish Conference, but on this question they are practically united and greatly in earnest.     I should estimate that at least 95% of the farmers of England and Y/ales are resolved to fight against a change of policy.     In this they are re-inforced by the large majority of landowners and by the Breed Societies of the country whose opera-tions have resulted in building up the finest pedigree flocks a^d herds in the world, and have been.a source of great profit to the country.     Leading scientific agriculturists like Professor T.B. Wood, head of the School of Agriculture at Cambridge, and Professor Wallace of Edinburgh,  take the same view.     Even farm labourers are
are inclined to view the removal of the embargo with disfavour as shown by an article in the October number of &quot;The Farm Worker&quot;, the official organ of the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union.&quot; &apos;. The Agricultural Press is unanimous onthe subject.     The reasons for this very strong opposition are briefly the following:-1. From the scientific point of view it is contended thatthe indiscriminate admission of cattle from Canada would be a retrograde step and might undo much of the good which has been -effected in the improvement of livestock by the Breed Societies and the various livestock schemes carried out with much care by the Ministry in recent years.     This country has become the stud farm of the world, all nations coming to us to replenish their herds, and it is contended that we must preserve the purity of our strains.     It should be noted that the proposal is to admit cattle from Canada without quarantine or any test whatever, a practice adopted by no other country;     &quot;Canada, for example, which makes this demand from ue, imposes 30 days&apos; quarantine and a tuberculin test in the case of cattle sent from this country to her,2. Farmers contend that the Oovernment, by repealingPart I of the Agriculture Act, have taken away the incentives to the &quot;plough policy&quot;,  the policy of stimulating by means of subsidies the growth of cereals,  and have driven back the industry on to livestock, and that the admission of Canadian stores will deal a serious blow to this branch of it.    It is true that a few big graziers are in favour of it, but the smallholders and&apos; small farmers who breed cattle in by far the greater part of England and Wales, -would suffer by it, and may largely be&apos;put out of business.     This is admitted by the Eoyal Commission, who state:-
&quot;Upon the whole, we think that there is reasonable &quot;ground for apprehending that the admission of Canadian &quot;stores might have prejudicial effect upon the welfare of &quot;the crofters and small farmers in the high-lying grounds &quot;in the Highlands&quot;, Why they confined this observation to the case of Highland crofters I do not know;    it is true of a very much larger number of smallholders and farmers in England and applies to farmers in Wales generally.     The feeling in Wales is indeed very strong on the subject.The Report is extraordinarily inconclusive on several points.     The Royal Commissioners deliberately excluded consideration of the danger which the country would run in war time if it became dependent on an overseas source of supply of stores.     Yet they admit that &quot;the Atlantic separates Sreat Britain from Canada and it is possible that the supply of stores from that source v/ould be impracticable in time of war &quot; .The Royal Commissioners further confined their attention exclusively to the question   of cattle from Canada, although their reference was drawn so as to cover the whole subject of the admission of livestock in general from anywhere outside the United Kingdom.     Tf the privilege be granted to Canada, 1 do not know how we can refuse any other Dominion or foreign country similar rights if it can show a clean bill of health. Already such demands are being made.     In the Shorthand Notes of the Meeting of the Prime Ministers of the British Empire.Vheld at Downing Street on the 29th July,  1921, Mr, Hughesentered this caveat..:*&quot;I do not want to take up your time, but nov? &quot;that Mr. Meighan has brought this matter up, I am &quot;sure you are aware of the position of the Australi
&quot;exporter.     I only want to call your attention to tho &quot;disabilities under which, he is labouring now.&quot; During the sittings of the Commission,  the Danish Minister forwarded a memorandum from the Icelandic Government asking for the admission of store sheen from Iceland, and similar requests are constantly &quot;being received by my Ministry.5. Under the pressure of falling prices and high wages thetendency of agriculture is at the present time away from arable farming and towards stock rearing.      &quot;With the improvement that is being effected in the quality of our grass-lands and the steady increase in the use of good sires among the smaller farmers the country is becoming more self-supporting in the matter of store cattle.     I deprecate any action that will check development in this direction.6. There is great fear that the admission of Canadian storeswould prejudicially affect the milk supply of the country. Sir Daniel Hall, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry, pointed out that the supply of milch cows depends, and must depend almost entirely,  on &quot;breeding and rearing calves at home, and that if (as he thought would result from the lifting of the embargo) breeding and rearing were discouraged in this country, there would be a grave danger of a shortage of milk.     Other witnesses, including Lord Astor, who were able to speak with authority on the milk question, were strongly opposed to the removal of the embargo.     It is true that the Commissioners did not take this view, but I cannot help feeling that in this matter their conclusions were at variance with the evidence.7. The lifting of the embargo would certainly hurt Irishbreeders as the Commissioners fully admit.     On this quests on, Ulster and the South of Ireland are in complete agreement.-Th^ removal would indeed constitute a new and serious Irish gri evanc e.
Under all the circumstances, therefore,  T strongly urge the Government not to introduce legislation with the object of admitting Canadian stores at the present moment at any rate.   The time is most Inopportune.     Farmers are in a bad way financially, and arc very apprehensive of Government action.     Many of them feel that wo &quot;gave them away&quot; over the repeal of the Agriculture Act and they would be exceedingly angry if we gave them away again. They would, feel it all the more because they realise that the bargain which was made in respect of the payment of this year&apos;s whea.t and oats has turned out greatly to our advantage and to their disadvantage.     That bargain will cost the State about  19,000,000, but if we had paid under the terms of the Act,  the cost would probably have been nearly  40,000,000.     If a bill to remove the embargo wore introduced it would meet with very strong opposition in the House of Commons, and would, almost Certainly be thrown out in the House of Lords.     The position of a Minister of Agriculture who introduced it would be a most unenviable one. ; I admit, however, that we shall have to meet two points,(l) The criticism that we are keening up the price of meat,(2) The request of the Canadian Government that weshould fulfil our pledge.As regards (l)  the Commissioners in their report are exceedingly sceptical as to any material reduction in price result&quot; ing from the free admission of stores from Canada.     The most they can say is : -&quot;We think that such admission would tend to &quot;cheapen in seme measure the meat supply of the &quot;country, but th-re are no data on which tho extent &quot;can be accurately gauged.     We think,  in the long &quot;run,  the tendency would be to bring prices to a &quot;level somewhat, but not greatly,   lower than that &quot;which would prevail if the embargo wore maintained.&quot;
On tho other hand thny repudiate&quot;entirely the statement which was so freely made at tho &quot;Dudley election that beef would he reduced by 6d. a pound.      &quot;During the last election at Dudley&quot;, they say, &quot;a statement was circulated, that the admission of Canadian stores would reduce prices of beef by 6d. per lb., and this figure was supported by some witnesses called before us in favour of admission; we are quite unable to accept it&quot;.      I should like to add that circumstances have entirely changed since the Spring of this year. Store cattle were then very dear, and there was a real shortage due to the temporary exclusion of Irish cattle on account of the existence of foot and mouth disease in Ireland.     How prices have fallen greatly and there is no shortage at all.     ITor do I think that the public after their recent experience of butchers&apos;  retail prices will be so ready to regard these gentlemen as pure philanthropists who desire the introduction of Canadian stores simply in order to give the consumers an advantage.     The butchers&apos; object is to buy Canadian stores which have been finished here at a lower price than British bred animals and the^ to sell them as British meat at the higher price which, it fetches.      Since January and February,  1921,  the price of beef has in fact dropped by almost exactly 6d.    a pound.     It is now 74i per cent, of its price at that time, but the price of fat cattle has fallen to 62 per cent, of what it was at the time of the Dudley election.     This only shows that the consumer&apos;s price does not even follow the price the farmer obtains,  still less the cost of the farmer&apos;s raw materials.With regard, to (?/) the promises made at the Imperial Conference in 1917 to the Canadian Government,  it should be observed that Lord Ernie stated before the Commissioners that his alleged pledge had reference only to certain war contingencies which did not arise, and he &quot;gave strong evidence against-the. proposal to lift the embargo.     Moreover, an examination of the circumstances under which the promise was made shows that the
Canadian cattle question was only one of a number of subjects which were considered by the Imperial Conference of .1917, the object of which was summed up in the resolution that &quot;the time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be given to the development of Imperial resources and especially to making the Empire independent of other countries in respect of food supplies,  raw materials and. essential industries&quot;.     These subjects included the extension through the Empire of Board of Trade services and Trade Commissions, co-ordination of legislation in respect of patents and trade marks, uniformity of policy as regards naturalisation, close co-operation with, regard to the production of naval and military material, the establishment of a Mineral Resources Bureau, and many other matters of Imperial interest.     Much has been accomplished in some of these directions,  in certain cases more by the Mother Country than by the Dominions, and in any case, the Canadian cattle question cannot be regarded as an isolated subject on which special pledges were given.     Moreover, the Canadian Government while urging the removal, of the embargo and always strongly resenting the imputation that their cattle were excluded, from this country On the score of disease, have invariably taken the very proper attitude that thoy did not press the Mother Country to alter the law if by so doing her own people would be injured.     I suggest, therefore, that wo should make a public declaration informing the Canadian Government that the embargo is not retained on the score of the risk of disease, the danger of which : &quot;.we do not regard as serious in view of the undoubtedly clean bill of health which has existed for many years in the Dominion, but that we are unable to remove it because by so doing we should inflict serious damage on agriculture at home. I should particularly emphasise throe considerations, viz
(a) that the proposed change of policy would make us dependent on an overseas source of supply for stores, which would he dangerous in war time.     Our policy should he one of production at home,  especially in a case like this where we can without difficulty or economic loss become self-supnorting.(b) that it would, put out of business a large number of small farmers and smallholders,    a class whom we particularly wish to foster and assist.(c) that British agriculture is in a depressed condition at the present time and that the proposed step would shake confidence and tend to aggravate the depression.I would add that the Council of Agriculture for England, a statutory body which it is my duty to consult on questions of this nature, has carried a resolution condemning the proposed removal of the embargo by a ver3&apos; large majority, and. The Welsh Council at their meeting on December 15th passed a similar resolution memine contra-dicente.A , \jr , ii .19th December,  1921.
