THE ROYAL IRISH COUST ABULARY...The announcement that the Government has reached an agreement, with Sinn, Fein has aroused the liveliest feeling of apprehension in all ranks of the Royal Irish&apos;Constabulary* In a telegram- despatched on the 7th Instant to the Prime Minister jointly by the officers and men&apos;s Representative Bodies, It is stated that, &quot;All ranks of the Royal Irish &quot;Constabulary vie?r with the greatest consternation the terms &quot;of the agreement between the British Government and the Sinn &quot;Fein delegates as far as these, terms affect the Royal Irish &quot;Constabulary..    A joint meeting ,of the Representative Bodies &quot;of Officers and Men of, the Force on. their behalf assembled &quot;at- the Depot, on this date, request an assurance from you that &quot;the unanimous demand, for, the di-sband.rn.ent of the Force on the &quot;terms placed before your.Government by them on the 14th &quot;October last .....v to be at, once acceded.to.&quot; :&apos;In replying yesterday to a similar-&quot;-tele.gram-.- addressed to His Majesty.The.--Liing -I felt bound to give an assurance- that, the future of,the Force, was being considered by.the Government and that.their-decision would be. communicated as soon as&apos; possible.;&apos;   -..&apos;-&apos;.&apos;-&apos;. &apos;  .The representations referred tP in the telegram from the. Chairman. of the Joint-^Representative Bodies were put. before me at Doputations. which I received ,on the 14th October last from^ the. Officers!- :and. Mans.---lie present at ive Bodies...   The., principal point urged by both Bpdi^s what that the Force should not. be transferred as :&apos;;contemplated .und.er.. the Government - of .Ireland .. Act, .1920, but-,should, be completely disbanded.    1 After dis- . bandment it. would&apos; pf:: course, bo open, to -such members . of the
Force as might desire to do so to join the new Police Forces&quot; to be raised by the Governments of Northern and Southern Ireland,     Both Bodies urged very strongly that the Government should accede to their request.     It y&amp;s urged that &apos;&apos;it was the unanimous wish of all ranks of the &apos;&apos;Royal Irish,-Constabulary that, the Thole force should-be disbanded rather than partition-ed arid.handed over in part to the Government of -Northern. Ireland and to the Government&apos; of Southern-: Ireland, .  The -Royal Irish- Constabulary had been an Imperial Force at the timp/when they joined it&apos;, and they had no desire they said to. serve..in any; part of it when it had ceased to -be an Imperial Force.. They vier-ed with the utmost disfavour the possibility of-being handed over to the :government&quot;&apos;of &quot;Southern Ireland, composed&apos;    -as&apos; it would be entirely of members of the- Sinn,-Fein party&apos;, against whom all their efforts had been directed in. the., struggle of the last few&apos; years.&apos;  &apos;&quot;   &apos;&apos; - .  ; ,I-enquired&quot;whether this view applied only to transfer to the -Government of Southern. Ireland or whether the -Police had an equal objection &quot;to being transferred to the. Government of Northern Ireland-, - and I&quot; was :assured that the Force.&apos;were equally unanimous against transfer to-&quot;-either Government *     Reference was made to recent attacks by public men&apos;In Ulster, one of whom -had -denounced the Catholic Members of the :R.oyal Irish Cons tab-ulary.as Sinn Feiners and was reported to have stated his belief that there was a disloyal section who - were&quot;- Indirectly assisting. Sinn Fein in Belfast,&quot; &apos; ^In favour of the proposal for the -disbancteent of the Fcroe it was further argued that the&apos; people of&apos; -Ireland would never forget, the part played- by the-&apos;Royal Irish Constabulary, In the past.     It would be impossible for men born in the -South to return to their homes j&apos;   even if&apos;.&apos;they were--net in any physical
ldanger, life would be made intolerable for them owing to the hostility of their neighbours.In reply to these Populations T did not offer any opinion inregard to the merit of the claims; for disbar.dcent put forward bythe Force.     I did, however, undertake, that this question would bereceive my careful consideration and that in due course it wouldbe wuhmitted to the Government for decision,..  Since that time the position has been altered in the followingimportant respect-.   Article 10 of the Government&apos;s Agreement withSinra Fein provides that       &apos;&quot;The   Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay &quot;fair compensation on terms not less favour able. than those &quot;accorded by.the Act of 19SO to judges,  officials, members &quot;of Police Forces and other Public Servants.who are. discharges &quot;by it or who retire in consequence of the change of &quot;government effected in pursuance hereof.1&apos;&quot;Provided that this agreement shall not apply to members &apos; &quot;of the Auxiliary Police Force or to persons recruited in &quot;Great Britain for the Royal Irish Constabulary during the &quot;two years next preceding the date hereof.    The British Gov-&quot;-emmant will assume responsibility for such compensation or &quot;pensions as may be payable to any of these excepted persons&quot;The result of this provision is that men recruited otherwise than in Ireland who have bacons permanent members of the Royal. -Irish Constabulary.during the past two years will be automatically disbanded under the terms of the agreement.     They will thus     : : ; secure in full measure the concession unanimously pq&apos;t forward for. the whole Force by the Representative Bodies. .It will.be seen from the attached Table that there are -at &apos; the present time nearly 6,000.non-commissioned - officers and con-stables affected by this provision who. will be automatically dis-banded under the terms of the Government&apos;s agreement.    The non-commissioned -officers and men of..over two years service in
the Force at tho present time number approximately 7,000. Those are in fact the backbone of the Force and are the men who h*ve given the beat years of their lives ir the service of the Grown.     It would, I think, he most unfair, that these tried pnd loyal men should obtain less favourable terns than these accorded in the Government18 pgreement to the men re-recruited in Great Britain during the last two years.     I am convinced that the same terms should be i&amp;ven to the men of over tvo years service, and T therefore ask the Cabinet to a&amp;ree to the disbandment of the .whole Force on equal terms .If this proposal is accepted, a further financial liability will necessarily be incurred beyond that vhich vroyld arise if the terms of the Govemnent of Ireland Act, 1920, were adhered to.     Arrangements wld have to be made with the Government of Northern Ireland and the Government of the Irish Free State for computing the excess expenditure involved b?r disbanding the whole Force beyond that which woi Id have been incurred by the new Irish Governments under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920;,     This excess expenditure v*ould require to be met from Imperial&apos; Funds.- -    , .
