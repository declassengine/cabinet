They have also &quot;raided&quot; three workshops where the employees were said to be working overtime.Plans are being made to inconvenience &quot;bourgeois shoppers&quot; by a march of unemployed in the West End to-morrow.The prospects of the unemployed in Lancashire and Cheshire appear gloomy, owing to the depression in the local industries.There is little surface activity among the Communists: the movement is, however, essentially one that functions in times of orisis and none of the leaders have dropped out.The Comnunist Party has bought the Russian film &quot;Hunger&quot; and hopes to show it in the Albert Hall.The National Administrative Council of Workers&apos; Committees has about  70 and in the absence of a further subsidy from Russia the movement is not likely to make much progress.The circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has fallen to 180,000 oopies.
THE unemployed on Deoember 9th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled 1,733,718, a decrease an the preceding week:   of this number, about 1,675,618 wsre in receipt of the tin employment benefit.     On the same day, short time workers numbered 255,300 and the number of persons employed on relief work was estimated to be about 107,000.The chief feature of the unemployed agitation during the week has been the demand, in London and in the provinces, for increased relief at Christmas:   in louden there is a tendency towards drastic treatment of the Guardians.There have been &quot;raids&quot; by the unemployed enfactories in Ponders End, Walthamstow and in Smothwlck,-where&apos;employees were said to be working overtime. &apos;On December 16th the following resolution was passed at a meeting hold in the Avondale Hall, Brixton, at which theMaysr of Lembeth presided:   about 500 people were present:&quot;That this meeting of citizens of Laabsth --views with alarm and indignation the apathy and indifference of the Government with   regard to the destjtution and demoralisation of the workers through unemployment and demands that the Government should make a grant of 100 million pounds for the extension ,..of tubes -and trams int?s the country districts to relieve the housing question end bring down the rents. Further this meeting instructs the Lambeth Borough 0oiaicil&apos;.to invite all the local authorities and County Councils within 20 miles cf London to a Conference for the pur-pose of considering how tho money spent in relief and Labour Exchange&apos;vdoles can be spent on useful-work.&quot;Plans are being-made by the leaders of the-organised unemployed for a demonstration to-morrow(Friday):    tho idea is to cause inconvenience to &quot;bourgeoisshoppors&quot; in tho Wost End:   arrangements have been made for
a preliminary meeting in Hyde Park, to be followed by a march from Marble Arch,    Wiltshire, one of the area organisers in the Metropolitan district, told my correspondent last week that T,the Third International is sending some money shortly to be&apos; used on behalf of the unemployed, &quot;and that if it were &quot;satisfied with 1he work done, it will vote more.&quot;My correspondent sends a.gloomy report of the unsaployment situation in Lancashire and Cheshire and says that the position in Liverpool and Manchester i8 &quot;appalling&quot;, figures for the week end ing December 9th showed an increase in the case of tho wholly unemployed and of the part time workers,     The outlook in the cotton, mining and engineering industries is depressing.     The organised unemployed in Liverpool hare been granted the use of the gallery In St. Martin&apos;s Hall but are not satisfied and the loaders are hinting at the use of unconstitutional methods.   . Communists are also active among &quot;the unemployed in Rochdale,The meetings in the Horth Eastern area have on the whole not been well attended but deputations have waited upon tho Guardians in Newcastle and Gateshead:   on December 14th a number of unemployed attempted to enter the gallery of the Gateshead Town Council Chamber during a meeting but were prevented by the police.      In Sunder land the extremist section of tho unemployed is active:   Lenagh has refused t-o vacate the rooms used by the unemployed in Tatham Street unless alternative accommodation is provided;   the Town Council has decided to take the stops necessary to secure the rooms.On December 15th a meeting of the Midland Divisional Council of unemployed was held in the Independent Labour Party rooms at Smethwick;   36 delegates from various unemployed commit too 3 were pro sent including:William/

King&apos;s Heath   Unemployed Commitee, Bixmingharo. Stourbridge Unemployed Committee, Worcester. Tipton Unemployed Committee, Staffs.J.V. Leckie, temporary Midlands organiser of theCommunist Party, was also present and twenty three of the delegates were comrunists.   Thore was a good deal of disorder,caused in the first place by the presence of Leckie, whoseright to be present was questioned by Grant: Leckiechallenged Grant to a fight, whereupon Harvey said to him&quot;Is this the state of your mentality when you hare to resort to force when you cannot win by brains?&quot;   The predominance ofthe communists was proved by the election of Brain to thepost of Midlands divisional organiser of the NationalAdministrative Council of Unemployed:   ho received 23 votes,Wakefield 13.It was stated at the outsat of the meeting that theAlum Rock and Saltley Committee had severed connection withthe National Administrative Council of Unemployed:   Brain saidthat the Birmingham commatxees were not in as good a positionas had been the case a month ago and that they were notpaying their quota of money to divisional or national,councils,A delegate retorted that the committees could not be expectedto pay the council when the council could not show whatbecame of the money receive a.In/
In consequence of his failure to secure re-election as Midlands organiser TTakefield has decided to concentrate on Smethwick and if possible to build up a Midlands Divisional Council in opposition to that controlled by Brain.As a result ox the adverse report given by the delegate who attendee: the national conference in Manchester last month, KIngTs Heath unemployed committee 3ms severed its connection with the national body:    a small extremist committee has. however, since been formed,The leods unemployed committee, which is composed chiefly of engineerss has circularised local trade union branches suggesting that overt In e bo limited to one hour P6r week per person, and that before working hours are altered a tro-f-hii&apos;ds majority of a ballot veto must be obtained.     At Sheffield trouble is reported to be brewing : over the   question of a dayrs pay which was stopped by the Guardians in the case of men who left their work to attend a demonstration last month:    the ringleaders are Butler, Smith, Haydcck and Butcher.It is reported that discontent among the unemployed is increasing in the South West cf Scotland.     Since the imprisonment of John Maclean, Sandy Ross and McJJougall, the Communist Party has gained control of the organised unemployed in Glasgow.   Robert Stewart ard Hannah, cf the International Union of E.C--Service Men, are active in this connection: the latter urges his audiences to perfect their organisation revolutionary lines and not to follow orthodox: trado union structureaJohn Maclean polled only 243 votes in the Springburn WaP as against 2,460 secretary-red by the labour candidate.THE CCMT-JUSriSTSThe British Communist Party has decided to purchase a olIof the Russian film &quot;Euwaer&quot;, ts which reference was made      I iin/ I

We can make 54 new slides for 108/- or 4,000 marks and copies much . more, cheaply.     Therefore the fact that 54 slides from the Berlin committee cost 5,000 marks Is much critioisod.   . Eh&amp;t means 95 marks e&amp;oh or 360 marks for four:   that means that the cost of four small pieces of glass iseciual to the wages of a German worker for a whole weak.   The comrades here think that it must be a swindle or that you need a new manager.     Perhaps it is a misunderstanding, otherwise we om make the slides here more&quot; cheaply,   ..,&quot;I have sent several propaganda articles regarding relief &quot;work to different ,v,;xjrs and it is. bur intention to show the ,rHuri er&quot; film in the Albert $all in London and to invite Lloyd.

In countries where there is no Jewish section measures should be taken to form one, or to work in conjunction wit!) local communist orsr&amp;nisations.    As a result ofthis/

THE BKJ IHTBRKATIOHaL OF LABOUR UBIOKSThe London conference of the Bed International ofLabour Unions will he held in the Bfssex Hall on Deoomber14th:   the following are tho two chief resolutions:&quot;This meeting of delegates assembled in Conference on January 14th, pledge themselves to resist any attempt to introduce longer hours: into any industry.   It calls upon the Executive Committees of the Union represented at this Conference to organise immediately a united resistance to this despicable attempt further to exploit the workers, and demands that the General Council of Trade Unions be called togother in ordor that the necessary arrangements oan &quot;be ratio  t&apos;or a national fight If necessary.&quot;&quot;This Oonferonce recognises that in the event of the official Trade Union Movement refusing to take action to prevent the present hours being extended, it then becomes the duty of the Rank and File themselves to take action.   The Conference declares it is the duty of every Trade Unionist to refuse to work the longer hours where suoh are introduced, but only to work the existing hours, after which they should leave the factory,   ^here such action is taken this Conferonoe pledgee itself to support the men involved whatever consequences are entailed.   It further instructs the London Committtee to arrange meetings with all tho local Unemployed Committees, so that there need be no fear of the Unemployed being used to broak down our resistance to the introduction of Longer Hours of Labour.&quot;Kfforts are already being made to arrange meetings with local unemployed committees and P.E. Dallas, of Camberwell, is active in this connection.   It is unlikely that delegates to this conference will be given strike mandates and in any case It is Improbable that the extremists would be able to bring about any strike of importance in opposition to the advice of trade union officials.Arrangements are being: made for a similar conference in the St. Mungo Grand Assembly Rooms, Gorbals Stroet, Glasgow, on January 21st, 1928.   It is stated that Tom Mann will preside but he will probably bo in the States: resolutions dealing with unemployment, wage reductions,   *tj extension of hours and industrial organisation will besubmitted/
submitted,   lismer has sent invitations to 871 trade union branches and Trades Councils in Airdrie, Ayr, Coatbri&amp;ge, Dumbarton,   Palkirk, Glasgow, Groenock, Hamilton, Eilmarn^ck, Paisley, Bertfrew, V/lshaw:   the ur&quot;&quot;Vic covered include bollermakers, dock labourers, builds $ txnlo workers, blacksmiths, engineers, electrici&apos;&quot;is, garment workers, distributive workers, sailors ah.&apos;  firemen, general \Morkers, shop-assistants and vehicle workers.HO. 5 of the Moscow bulletin of thi Red International of Labour Unions contains a list of. the members of propaganda committees in various countries.   The British concerned are J.T. Murphy (lletal Workers) , John Strain (Wood Workers), Nat Wat kins (Miners) and Ellen Wilkinson (&quot;Government Workers&quot;).AWat kins has applied for a passport covering the Central European countries and is no doubt going to Russia as a result of the Moscow communications quoted in previous reports.THE RED ORGANISATION Off SEAMEN ,  . -&quot; (The proposed out in the wages of seamen and firemen of  3 per month on ocean going vessels and 14s. a week on coasting vessels is being exploited by the extremists in ports.   In Liverpool there is great resentment among ordinary seamen and some officers have promised that in the event of a strike they will not. work&apos;with &quot;scab&quot; labour:   raj&apos; correspondent is, however, of opinion that there would not be much support for a strike in Liverpool, owing to the prevalence of unemployment among officers and men.In Cardiff also there is much opposition to the proposed cut3 which are stigmatised a3 &quot;unjust&quot; and&quot;unwarranted &quot;/
&quot;unwarranted&quot;.   The soamen feel, however, that a strike would not ho successful and suggest that the reduction should not exceed 5s, per week.On december 19th there was considerable disorder outside the Kingston Hall in Glasgow, on the occasion of a seamen meeting addressed by Mr. Havelock Wilson, M.P.:   members of the British Seafarers Union and the Cooks and Stewards Union were excluded from tho meeting and about 200 of them attempted to rush the doors: several men who were prominent in the hustling of Mr. Wilson were arrested.. James Quinton, to. whom reference has been made in previous reports, is still active in Hamburg:   he   appears to be concentrating on propaganda among British seamen in that port and has issued a leaflet entitled &quot;Solidarity and victory, or disunity, which? - Australia1s lead for British seamen,&quot; in which he urges the necessity of international solidarity and the appointment of Port Committees of seamen, wharf and transport workers, &quot;irrespective of flag   nationality or colour.&quot;   He states that:&quot;The present conditions of German workers are a fearful menace to all other workers.   1050 marks, less than 25s. per month, the wage for German Firemen, compares badly to our Australian  16 - for Firemen. This one fact alone justifies this appeal.    This fact is also a constant incentive to Ship Owners to use German Seamen as Scabs.   All other teamen, Britishers in particular, must work &quot;1th that section of the German Unionists who recognise this fact. Together we must strive to raise the social standard of the German Seamen,   Why are many thousands of Seamen in Britain, according to Mr. Cathery K.S. and F.U. unemployed?   Compare your wages with German wages and find out:   shall we pull our wages down further, or raise the German standard?&quot;Charles Beech i3 now in Hamburg find will probablyjoin forces with Quinton and Jack Ajpleby, who has recentlybeen In Moscow:   Dick Beech is also on his way to Hamburg.Ji.&apos;..ck/
Jack Tanner is in touch with A.E. Chapman regarding the rod organisation of seamen in Glasgow and has asked him to get in touch with Pdtheringham as &quot;we are going to frame up on Cotter if necessary^ if we oan get different fellows in the different ports, and a co-ordinated policy we will he able to make the new union look like the proper thing, so bring him into line, if possible, and put him in touch with myself and Breslow.&quot;THH!   ^RE^RS&apos; C0MUITT5g MOVEI-ISNTOn December llth and 12th a secret meeting of theNational Administrative   Council of Workers&apos; Committeeswas held in Manchester:   there were present,J.R. Campbell ChairraanT. Kime secretary. Ritchie Scottish MinersT. Shanks Clyde ValleyJ,E. Cameron Newcastle engineers- - . Tagg Nottinghamshire minersT. Ding-ley Midlands engineersJ. iii eld - Marine Transport Workers,Liverpool.J. Braddock Industrial Workers of theWorld, Liverpool3. Tanner Industrial Workers of theWorld, LondonH. Webb Representative of the CommunistParty Executive.The financial report of the secretary disclosed a balance of about  70 fit will be remembered that theNational Administrative Council received at least  2,600from Moscow at the beginning of the year).   Kime statedthat  30 were owing from the Communist Party and  50 fromthe Red International of Labour Unions.     Prom the subsequent discussion it was apparent that the delegates had small hope of raising money from their supporters,Ritchie reported that several Scottish miners&quot; committeeshad paid fees but that he could not maintain correspondence with/
Kirker.   Nisid said that the financial position in Liverpool was bad and a similar statement was made by Din^ley who complained of the competition of industrial committees of    j the Communist Party:   he said that tho movement was flourishing in Rugby, where it controlled the activity of various trade unions.     In Coventry there was a continuous fight between the Communist P^rty and the Workers&apos; CommitteesRitchie stated that the Scottish mining district had been divided into four sections, Ayrshire (  committees), Stirlingshire (6 committees), Lanarkshire (3 committees) and Pifeshire:   there was a movement on foot to start a new union by a Catholic sect whisht was&apos; opposed to the Orangemen and the movement generally was suffering from the general apathy which followed the miners&apos; stoppage.   In Flfeshire the committees were developing along the same lines as in South Wales but were &quot;very weak owing to the existence of strong Independent Labour Party and Socialist Labour Party tendencies.&quot;     Campbell reported that there was no friction in Glasgow where the Communists were working side by side \vi the Workers&apos; Committees.     There was a Marine Transport section in Glasgow and a full time organiser had been maintained in the dock area with the result that comaiittees had. been formed on board many ships leaving the port.Nield stated that they had arrived at Liverpool at the stage when no progress could be made with dockers&apos; committees and that a system of area committees has therefore been started:   about 900 men had joined the Vigilance Committees some time ago but ainon^. them were many reactionaries:   the latter had now formed themselves into a maritime union on the initiative of ?hinwell, but had no financial backing .   Nield added that many members of the Vigilance Committee were opposed to the Communist Party;    they favoured control of Industry but v/ould secedeif/
if the Communist Party attempted to force its industrial policy on them.     Braddook disagreed with Meld and ur;;ed that the Vigilanco Committee should work in conjunction with the Communist Party.At this stage Webb interposed and read a Communist thesis on the industrial situation:   he then urged that the Workers1 Committees should be kept together as nuclei of a movement which could function in a time of crisis;   he claimed that most of the committees wore composed of members of tho Party but Campbell, Ritchie and Meld disproved this statement.After much discussion it was decided that the balance of the funds should go to the &quot;Worker&quot; and that &quot;the Headquarters be established at Glasgow with the paper and that the secretary be voluntary position,   T. Eime to carry on at home in london as the secretary of the English committees,&quot;   Expenses of Kime&apos;s removal from Manchester to London are to be defrayed from the funds.The following divisional organisers wore appointed:Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire delegate is to be elected later,THE DAILY HERALDAn article by George Lanabury in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of December 17th contained tho following passage, which confirms the report given last week:Tom Din&amp;ley Nat Watkins J, Bield        ) 3* Braddock   ) G9 Harvey A, Ritchie T.

ya resolution was unanimously carried asking the Joint National Council, representing the Labour Party Executive and the National Council of the Trades Union Congress, to take over the future responsibility and control of the paper.,&quot;The Hational Joint Council has appointed a small oommittee to go into the question and report as early as possible on the subject.&quot;It is not for us in this office to prejudice the decision that will he arrived at,   ,,;fe are confident, however,, that the more investigation there is, and the more the facts connected with the-paper are known, the stronger will be the de-sire to&apos; retain it as an   integral part of the Labour Movement.&apos;1   &apos; &apos;On December 17th George Lansbury -Addressed a meeting in Nottingham on behalf of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; &quot;Sack to-a-Penny Campaign.&quot;      Tickets were issued only to bpna fide trade union officials, about 500 of whom were present.   George Lenabury said that the circulation of the paper was no?/ 180,000 and that he wanted to make it 300,000.   In answer to euestions as to whether the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was being sold to the Labour Party T.anabury replied, &quot;Wait and seel&quot;An interesting point was raised by a delegate from the National Union of Lailwaymen, who&apos; said that, when paper was very dear his union purchased a large quantity for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and handed it over as required:   when paper became cheaper, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; purchased from other source^ with the result that the National Union of Railwaymen now has paper on its hands representing  0,000.   The delegate wished to know when the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was going to take over this paper and Lansbury replied that his paper could not now afford to buy from any but the cheapest source.     Photographs of Mr. Lansbury were auctioned, about a hundred being sold: the &quot;Bed Flag&quot; was sung at the conclusion of the meeting.On December 18th Lansbury addressed a meeting of about 800 people, hold under the auspices of the IndependentLabour/
Labour Party in Bradford:     hi3 speech dealt chieflj with unemployment and the imprisonment of the Poplar Counci llors.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES   III GREAT BRIG?AIMG?he bulk of the prominent men in the movement are supporting Arthur Griffith   and Michael Collins, but Art O^rien, C.B.
