[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP.-3527.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 28th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.So far as the observance of the truce is concerned, the situation remains, generally, as described in my last Report. The new local liaison machinery con-tinues to work satisfactorily, and, although it would be premature to look for an appreciable reduction in the number of breaches as a result of these arrangements, it is obvious that successful local co-operation in liaison matters must tend in that direction. As I have already indicated, however, the present situation in Ireland is at best, one of unstable equilibrium, and so long as the political future of the country remains indeterminate and uncertain, with the possibility of a sudden reversion to a state of active hostilities constantly present in the minds of both parties, the danger of a general breakdown of the truce through the accident of some ill-considered or deliberately mischievous action of irresponsible individuals on either side is not lightly to be disregarded.A very serious breach of the truce was committed at Clogheen, -Clonakilty District, Co. Cork, on the 22nd instant, when three unarmed soldiers of the Sher-wood Foresters, in charge of six horses, were held up By a band of about forty men, some of whom were armed, who took possession of the horses, which have not yet been recovered. The soldiers Avere detained for about two hours and then released. Two other breaches, involving attacks on members of the Crown Forces, were an assault upon a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Bagenalstown, Co. Carlow, on the 23rd instant, and the firing at and wounding of a military officer of the R.A.S.C. at Carrigan, Co. Roscommon, on the 27th instant. A full report of the last-mentioned incident has not yet been received, but according to a telegraphic report the officer was robbed of his revolver and of a sum of  30 and his^ motor-bicycle was set fire to and destroyed. It is possible, therefore, that this outrage may be found on further enquiry to have been an ordinary case of highway robbery unconnected with Sinn Fein.On the24th instant Rathkeale Workhouse, in which a detachment of the I.R.A. had been quartered for several weeks, was deliberately destroyed by its occupants, to prevent its being taken over by the Military for use as winter quarters for Crown Forces. The occupation of this workhouse by the I.R.A. had been brought to the notice&apos; of Mr. Michael Collins and the Truce Committee some weeks ago, and the demand for its evacuation made. This is one of the worst cases of a breach of the truce by Sinn Fein, because it was the deliberate destruction of Government property by the I.R.A. All workhouses in Ireland are vested in the Irish Local Government Board.An attempt on the 26th instant to procure arms and ammunition for the I.R.A.. by purchase from members of the Company of the Auxiliary Division stationed at Corofin, Co. Clare, was attended with unlooked-for consequences to the would-be purchasers. A Lewis gun and a quantity of ammunition had been stolen from this Barrack on the 28th ultimo in circumstances which pointed to collusion with some[7420]
person or persons within the Barrack, and on the 4th instant two members of the Company reported that they had been approached by an unknown civilian with a proposal for the sale of rifles and revolvers. The Company Commander, with a view to apprehending the culprits and, if possible, of discovering the true facts of the theft already committed, directed that the proposal should be taken up and that arrangements should be made as if for the carrying out of the sale. About 9 p.m. on the day appointed for the transaction to be completed, the 26th instant, three men appeared at the back gate of the Barrack, where they were met by the two members of the Company with whom the bargain had been struck, and at a given signal a party; of cadets who were lying in wait closed in upon them and proceeded to effect their arrest. After an exchange of shots, in which one of the cadets and all three civilians were wounded, two arrests were made and one of the prisoners has since been identified as a former member of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who is known to have joined the I.R.A. since his dismissal.Among the other breaches of the truce during the week were twenty-three cases of illegal arrests. In fourteen of these cases the persons arrested are known since to have been released.Disturbances in Kilkenny and Galway Prisons.On the 22nd instant forty-three Sinn Fein prisoners (forty-two convicted and one unconvicted) succeeded in effecting their escape from Kilkenny Prison by cutting through the floor of a cell and tunnelling a passage underneath the prison wall. The manner in which this operation was carried out suggests that it can only have been rendered possible by culpable negligence on the part of the prison authorities, and I have directed an immediate enquiry to be held into the matter.A serious mutiny on the part of the Sinn Fein prisoners in Galway Prison broke out on the 23rd instant. About 10-30 A.M., during the time allotted for .&quot; associa-tion,&quot; the political prisoners, numbering thirty-five, suddenly overpowered the warders and set fire to a portion of the prison. They then proceeded to barricade themselves in the adjoining wing and armed themselves with bars torn from the iron staircase. A detachment of police were called in to assist the warders, and after breaking through the barricade engaged the prisoners in a hand-to-hand conflict with their batons. After a short struggle, in which eleven prisoners and twelve police received injuries, none of a serious nature, the prisoners were overpowered and confined in separate cells. In consequence of this outbreak, the prisoners were deprived of the privilege of &quot; association,&quot; and on an attempt being made to counter this disciplinary measure by a hunger-strike, all the political prisoners, with the exception of the eleven who had been wounded in the fracas and had been removed to hospital, were transferred to Liverpool Prison on the 27th instant.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The results of eight trials by Court-Martial were concluded during the week, convictions being obtained in seven of the cases. Sentences of nine months&apos; hard labour in three cases and one year&apos;s hard labour in one case were imposed for attempting to escape from an Internment Camp. The remaining three convictions were obtained on charges of raiding for arms and being in possession of a shot-gun, sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour being imposed in each case. The acquittal was the case of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was charged with wounding and assaulting a civilian on the 24th September last.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 26th instant: Total orders made    ... ... ... ... ...      4,388Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       243 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       745-        988Number of persons now interned ... ... ...      3,400The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 8.

The Special Constabulary is now for all purposes a purely Northern service, and the Eoyal Irish Constabulary (including the temporary branches of the Force) stationed in the Six Counties, while remaining for the present an -Imperial service, has been placed at the disposal of the Northern Government for the maintenance of order and the suppression of crime. It is regretted that the assumption of the heavy burden of government by the newly-constituted State could not have been made under happier auspices. The Belfast riots of the past fortnight with their appalling casualty roll of 32 dead and 102 wounded, throw a lurid light upon the difficulties which the Northern Government will now be called upon to face, and the future not only of Ireland, but of the Empire, may well depend upon the degree of wisdom and statesmanship that is brought to their solution.H.
