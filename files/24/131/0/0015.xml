[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921,SECEET.CP. 3515.THE  CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT the present time the garrison of Palestine consists of: 3 Indian cavalry regiments shortly to be replaced, by 3 British cavalry regiments. 2 British battalions. 1 Indian battalion. 1 battery Royal Horse Artillery. .1 British pack battery. 1 Indian pack battery,together with ancillary services.The total establishment is 7,670, yielding a combatant strength of 4,000 rifles,&quot; The. total strength on our ration and pay list is, with labour and followers, 13,287. The War Office see no prospect of diminishing this force in the immediate future, and they have informed me that its cost for the year 1922-23 will be in the neighbourhood of 2,750,000L, to which must be added 750,O0OZ. for barracks, a total roughly of about 3,500,0001.1 consider that this is more than we can afford. I invite the Cabinet to transfer the military control of Palestine to the Colonial Office in the same way as has been recently done in the case of Iraq and has for a generation been the rule in East and West Africa, If this were assented to, I should propose to release all the British troops, saving their expensive maintenance and still more expensive barracks, and to substitute the following garrison : .&apos; . : :. 13 squadrons of aeroplanes.2   armoured car companies.2   Indian infantry battalions.1   Indian cavalry regiment. &quot;1   Indian pack battery,together with ancillary services.To this I would add a Palestine gendarmerie of British nationality of a high individual -status, aggregating about. 700 men. This gendarmerie, which would be tinder the civil administration, would animate and; dominate the local gendarmerie and make it an effective instrument. The total cost of this garrison would be approxi-mately l,u50,000 ., and I do not think any,large barrack accommodation would require to be built. Until the gendarmerie is fully equipped and organised and has established itself effectually as the controlling influence in the country, I should require to keep one additional Indian infantry battalion and cavalry regiment at a cost of approximately 35O,0O0Z. ; but I should hope to dispense with these, and indeed with most of the other Indian troops, as the country settles down and the police establish effectual control.An immediate saving on the Estimates of 1922-23 of certain 1  and possibly 1^ millions should be realised.I ask that a decision in this sense should be taken by the Cabinet, and that the Estimates for next year should be framed on this basis.As it will not be possible to release the British troops as early as the 1st April, a slight addition to their estimate will be required.W. S. C.Colonial Office, November 1921.[7395]
