[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP. 3541.MOPLAH  RIOTS.XIV.I circulate to my colleagues the following further telegrams which have been received from the viceroy on the subject of the Moplah riots. &apos;E. S. M.10th December 1921.From Viceroy, Home Department, 27th November 1921.Correspondence ending with my telegram dated 25th November. Moplah prisoners. Pioneer of 24th contained statement that in the throes of asphyxiation, several prisoners bit each other so severely on all parts of body that some bodies, were mangled beyond recognition. It has been ascertained from Local Government that this statement is absolutely untrue. All medical officers who saw prisoners and corpses on arrival at Podanur agree that with the exception of few slight scratches there were no external marks of violence.From Viceroy, Home Department, 28th November 1921.Malabar situation.   Following from Madras, dated 24th, received to-day :  &quot;In Malabar, troops reached line Perintalmanna-Paudikkad-Karvarakimdu yesterday according to plan. Practically no rebels seen. About 200 rebels reported gone to the north of Kulikavu. Majority appear to have moved south, but con-firmation lacking. Operations continue south-eastwards. Officer Commanding, Wynaad, reports 3,000 Moplahs registered at Kunnamangalam, where bazar has reopened, and traffic on Calicut-Vayittiri Road is normal. Southern Provinces Mounted Rifles L.M. Patrol, which has been patrolling road, being demobilised to-morrow, at request local civil authorities. Detachment South Indian Railway Battalion posted as guard at Olavakkot central to-day.&quot;Following, dated 25th: &quot;Numerous small rebel bands reported moved into hills to the east of Velliyancheri. Chin Kachins, when advancing to Periamodu on 23rd November, killed 17 rebels. Rebel band, estimated 60 strong, raided outskirts Wandur to-day, burning 47 houses and inflicting four casualties on inhabitants.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 29th November 1921.Contimiation onr telegram dated 21st November. Following is report of situation in Malabar for the week ending 28th November: &quot;Military operations. Force continued during the week in the interior of Ernad, first up to Kalikaon-Pandikkacl line, and then through the Chembrasseri country to the Velliancheri area. The large rebel concentration reported in last week&apos;s telegram did not however materialise, and the enemy seem to have broken up and taken to hills, or escaped through the line. Troops inflicted a few casualties, but on the whole the result of these drives was disappointing, and it will probably be more satisfactory to revert to old tactics of allotting different areas to different battalions to cleal with at leisure. Surrenders continue from Kottakkal area, where a real progress has been made, and also from round Mannarghat, and in the Calicut Taluk. Too much importance cannot however be attached these surrenders. Rebellion 4945      100   12.21
is work of gangs, who enlist temporary active support from local criminals, and otherwise only half-hearted support from the average Mapilla. It is latter who are surrendering, and gangs and criminals remain to be dealt with, and will have to be exterminated or decisively defeated before the rebellion can be ended. Several&apos;raids have been carried out by rebels, and spasmodic murders and looting continue to be reported. These may not affect main issues to any great extent, but naturally cause alarm and prevent restoration of public confidence. A public enquiry, under chair-manship Mr. Knapp, Special Commissioner for Malabar, holds first sitting to-day into Mapilla prisoners&apos; train catastrophe&apos;.- Mr.- Knapp assisted by three non-officials, and their report awaited from Madras. Have already taken opportunity to contradict certain misstatements, which have appeared in the Press, regarding this most deplorable incident.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 30th November 1921. Following from Madras, dated 26th, received 30th : &quot; Drive which commenced 21st November completed to-day ; precise results not yet known.   Rebels have avoided action and scattered into hills.&quot;Also following, dated 27th : &quot;Detachment 2/9th Gurkhas from Perantalmauna, operated against Pulamanthol, killing 10 and capturing. 10 rebels. Yesterday&apos;s reports show that many rebels escaping from drive have collected in Nilambur area, other bands making their way back to Arikkod and other places whence they came to join concentration&apos;. Further surrenders occurring about Kottakkal, where weekly market is commencing.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 30th November 1921.Following telegram received from General Officer Commanding, Madras District, by Chief of General Staff, dated 29th November :  &quot; Situation 18.00 hours. Troops moving to the areas allotted to them after conclusion of drive. Detachment l/9th Gurkhas operating from Perintalrnanna raided Ponniyakurusslii, killing five rebels. 500 rebels reported to have collected&apos; about Arikkod.&quot;From Viceroy, Army Department, 1st December 1921.Following is military appreciation of the situation in Malabar for past week :- Drive conducted through northern part of the Ernad Walluvanad Talukfs) has broken up concentrations of the rebels and has inspired confidence, although leaders&apos; have not yet been accounted for. Scattered members of the gangs have, for the most part, fled to foot of hills towards north-east, from whence they intend probably to work back to places they were driven from. Some small bands have evaded the drive in the jungle. West of a line Milanbur-Pandikkad-Perintalmanna, country is practically clear, save for a gang north-east of Arikkod, and the gang near Nilambur. Surrenders continue.From Viceroy, Army Department, 1st December 1921.Troops and policy (? sic police) are now being (omission)ed by (omissions),, so that the whole country may be covered, and so that there may be an organisation for taking possession of rebel supplies, and for hunting down any bands which may re-appear. This process must take time, but the finish is appreciably nearer; moreover, pacification will be accelerated in due measure as the populace, which-has so far been in a state of panic, recovers its confidence.Of the special armed police, four companies are now in being and at work, whilst two more are in process of organisation. It is evident the rebels have been cowed and are trying to evade battle; but we must still expect dacoilies, acts: of retaliation and desperate-undertakings by fanatical gangs. It; is not yet possible to relax either martial law or military pressure in any way.        a -,y

Following is report of situation in Malabar for the week ending 5th December : &quot;Definite areas have now been allotted to different battalions, so as to cover whole affected area. Some minor engagements with rebels have taken place, and surrenders continue from many parts of area hitherto chiefly affected, while there are signs that chief rebel leaders are becoming dissatisfied with progress of affairs. Near Melattur, large body of Mapillas have surrendered and handed in 250 swords, and Arikkod, which a few weeks ago was important rebel centre, is now displaying number of white flags. Chief gangs still remain to be dealt with, but it seems probable that these will decrease in size as time goes on. Main desideratum at present, apart fi&apos;om capture of leaders, is to restore confidence in non-rebel population, and to induce them to assist in apprehension of offenders and restoration of normal conditions. Present military dispositions are designed with this object, and will, it is hoped, have desired effect.   Civil population shows little enterprise.&quot;
From Viceroy, Home Department, 7lh December 1921.Following is extract from report of Surgeon-General, Madras, dated 26th. November 1921, regarding death of Moplah prisoners in train : &quot; Medical opinion here is solid and unanimous, and, now that I have heard the-whole story, I am quite convinced that the cause of death of the men who died in the truck was slow suffocation, together with heat exhaustion, and that we have no reason to suspect any other cause of death.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, 7th December 1921.Following telegram received from Headquarters, Madras District, dated 5th December, received 7th December : &quot; Situation 18.00 hours, and for the Madras Press. 29th Garhwal Rifles, 1st Battn., killed one, captured two, rebels, and two firearms, near A Hill.

Special Police killed four.rebels near Vennakkod. 2/Sth Gurkha Rifles killed two rebels near Chembrassheri. Total surrenders to 2/8th Gurkha Rifles at Melattur up to date, 2,256 men, four firearms, 1,122 swords; 39 men with six swords surrendered at Veil ay aim Secunderabad Column arrived Cocanada without incident.&quot;From Viceroy, Army Department, 8th December 1921. Military appreciation for past week, Malabar, as follows : &quot;Situation getting steadily better. Rebels surrendering freely, many weapons-being handed in. This considerably due to recent drive, which has broken tip gangs and made it possible to use troops in columns of smaller size and thus of greater mobility, and at the same time more numerous. The gangs which are still active are being hunted without respite by raids, both by day and night. It is believed that gangs are not numerous, but are hard to destroy as they are scattered over whole district and avoid encounters with troops. Apparently prestige and moral of rebels-are on the wane, and spirit of surrender is spreading.&quot;
