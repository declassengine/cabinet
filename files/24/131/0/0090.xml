V3&apos;p.P.3S88.THE SPANISH TARIFF.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.The Cabinet decided on.December 12th to adjourn discussion of the imposition of an import duty on Spanish fruit in order to enable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to examine the question in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade.The position is as follows:-About a year ago the Spanish.Government determined to revise their tariff and as an initial step they issued a Royal Order with immediate effect largely Increasing all import duties.     At the same time they appointed Tariff Commissions to enquire into the whole subject and invited recommendations from all interested bodies.     The Board of Trade took immense trouble and communicated through us to the Spanish Government a detailed memorandum explaining the effects of the provisional tariff on British trade and asking for reductions.     In every case but one the Tariff Commission has recommended, not reductions, but still further increases.     The percentage of increase proposed averages out at more than 100$ on British exports.Three facts stand out clearly:-(1)       that if the new tariff comes into force the very promising Spanisn market, will be closed to us except to a quite negligible extent, and this at a moment when the recovery of our export trade is almost a matter of life or death to us:
( ) that mere words,. i.e. ordinary diplomaticrepresentations, are quite useless unless backed by something stronger:(3) That the case of.;. Spain is unique   if that, if  :we. choose,. we can bring her to reason. ;.&apos;.  A British import prohibition on Spanish fruits would mean either the immediate&apos; reduction of the tariff ih^accordance with our wishes, or else bankruptcy for a large part of&apos; Spain,.possibly preceded or followed by a revolution. -   We take practically the whole Spanish fruit crop and the growers cannot find a, market elsewhere.As regards No.3-, -Sir E. Howard&apos;has reported a conversation between a member of his staff and three high Spanish customs official.als.     The former expressed the: opinion that we should be driven to retaliate against the hew tariff., .   The Assistant Director of &apos; Customs &quot;replied .that, the remedy was... in our own hands:, we could put a duty on Spanish fruit.     All three officials agreed that this would mean the ruin of&apos;half-Spain. .   Sir E.Howard has expressed a similar opinion in a recent;private letter.     He thinks if&apos; only- we&apos; decide&apos; definitely, to tax Spanish fruit if- the. Spaniards- will not&apos;&quot;be reasonable^ the simple threat-will be so terrifying that&apos; we shall&apos; get- our Way at once..    The fearful outcry raised in Spain-during the war when we-partially prohibited the importation of Spanish fruit is sufficient indication of what- would happen.-The objection- to&apos; the use&apos; of this weapon is that oranges are a staple luxury of the poor and it will obviously not be popular to penalise or prohibit &quot;the poor man&apos;s dessert.&quot;     Our Colonies are hot yet in a position to supply anything like the whole of the demand, and if a heavy duty on Spanish oranges- were imposed an outcry in this country would have to be reckoned with. Parliamentary sanction would be necessary before a duty oould be imposed and Parliament might refuse to give it,
These considerations need not, however., necessarily prevent the use of the&apos; weapon,     It is at least possible, not to say probable, that we should never -actually need to impose the duty.     The threat rnlpht, well prove sufficient.; but it is no use threatening unless we are quite determined to carry out the threat.     If H.:?*.G. definitely made up their minds to a sic Parliament for the necessary powers, failing s reduction in the tariff, we could at once tell the Spaniards of our intention and take cere it was known far and wide in Spain. This very likely -o uld be enough.     Supposing, however, the Spanish Government thought we were bluffing and proved obdurate even then the&quot;duties would probably never need to be levied. By the time Parliament meets, the Spanish fruit crop will be here and thus there could be no question of any duties taking, effect till&apos;the following autumn.     Once the Spanish Government realized we were in earnest they would- have to give way, in face of the. clamour of&quot;the Spanish fruit growers,.It &quot;is worth remembering -that the new duties are being imposed solely for the benefit.of Barcelona and the Catalans, and that Spanish public opinion as a whole is entirely opposed to the great increase In prices which the duties.must inevljrtably cause.     The new scale of duties is In fact already known as &quot;the Famine Tariff.&quot;Foreign Office.?lst December, 1921.
