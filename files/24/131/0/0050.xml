Hi I^cLkf   1910THIS DQCUt*SHT.IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MALESTY&apos;S GOVSRFxSMT.CABINET.RET 773549.&quot; &apos; SCHEME FOR ASSISTING LOCaL AUTHORITIES TOPliiD WORK POR THE UNEMPLOYED.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The Cabinet will remember that one of the main schemes for providing work for the unemployed was that sanctioned In September last to assist local authorities by means of grants from the Treasury to put In hand works of public utility.     The financial method of this scheme was that the Treasury would find not capital but(a) 65%&apos; of the interest and sinking fund on loans raised to meet expenditure on the works for half the period of the loans (up to15 years) in the case of non-revenue producing works and(b) 50$ of the interest for five years in the case 0- revenue producing worksj.The scheme is administered by Lord St. Davids&apos;Committee.?/hen the scheme was first considered in September last by the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment a provisional arrangement was coxae to with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the total amount of capital value to be found by local authorities, to which the contribution of interest and sinking fund would be made by the Treasury was to be  10.000,000, and that before Lord Stv Davids&apos;Committee should sanction schemes beyond that amount a further consultation should take place.   It was certainly hoped at that time that unemployment would be on a declining scale and that trade revival would soon have its effect.   This, however, is far from being the
case.       Unemployment remains acute, the last returns for the 2nd December shewed 1/83.5 ,.000 persona unemployed. It was also doubtful when the scheme was started how far the local&apos; authorities would respond, Great pressure has been brought to hoar by my Department on the local authorities to propose schemes and only quite recently it was understood that the Prime Minister intended to issue a letter urging the local authorities to proceed with schemes for the relief of unemployment.       The present position is this: Lord St. Davids&apos;Committee have approved up to tho 12th December of 680 schemes, of a total capital value of  7,500,000, affording employment estimated to occupy  80,000 men for one month.       The Committee has before them at present some 8 00 further schemes calling for a further capital expenditure of  7,000,000. This exceeds by  4,500,000 the provisional Unit of ,  10,000,000.A discussion took place at the Unemployment Committee held on the 13th December in which I and the Minister of Labour very strongly urged that it would be impossible to announce, practically within a few days&apos; time, to the local authorities that the Government scheme of assistance had reached its limit and could not be continued, and that therefore the limit of  10,000,000 should be extended..       The Chancellor of the Exchequer declared that it was impossible for him in the present, state of our national
finances, to go beyond the charge already imposed upon the Treasury or to make any alterations in the provisional amount of  10,000,00.0.       As no agreement could be arrived at it Is necessary to refer the quostion to the Cabinet for decision.As regards the financial burden on the Treasury it is impossible, without a great deal of clerical labour to calculate its exact amount, as the grants sanctioned vary from periods of 2% years to 15 years, some being in respect of interest only and others in respect of interest and sinking fund.       A rough estimate, however, sufficient I think for the purpose, allows that the amount would be about  400,000 a year in respect of schemes up to the  10,000,000 limit, and proportionately  6 00*000 in respect of schemes amounting in all to  15*000,000,     This is the maximum whioh would be borne by the Treasury alone in tho first 2-1- years and this would gradually diminish until it was extinguished in 15 years.     No part of this charge will be paid In the current financial year,I confidently submit to the Cabinet that of all the Government schemes for assisting Unemployment, this la by a very long way the cheapest from the standpoint,of the Treasury.       Tho men who aro unemployed will have to be maintained by this country in some way or other as ws are not prepared to let thorn starve.     Part of the amount needed will come from the Government and part from the rates.       It ail comes, of course, from the pockets of the people of this country.I dravf attention to the fact which frequently seems to be overlooked; that it is better to obtain some, concrete results by giving work rather than to
pay away money for the subsistence of the unemployed and. to get nothing in return,&apos;I would make a further observation.   However strained the national resources may be, however unfavour-able the national outlook, it is surely quite impossible  . to tell the local authorities, who have been urged on all hands to proceed with schemes of relief, and to tell the huge army of unemployed throughout the country that we cannot stand the further burden of, say,  200,000 a year or even more&quot;.    There has latterly been an agitation for the reduction of Income Tax, of which I am heartily in favour; but no Government to-day could undertake a policy which while appearing to relieve the wealthy would tell the million and a half workmen who are walking the streets that it is absolutely impossible to do anything more for them..-I very fully realise the difficulties of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and ho may not, unnaturally demand some limit to be placed, upon Treasury responsibilities^.    I think two limits could be found.   The one is a time limit-?   Under the present Circular issued by my Department to the local authorities the first of January is given as the date by which Schemes have to be startedo    This is too short a period. If assistance were limited to schemes submitted by the first of February it would automatically fix the limit needed.    If the amount were fixed at  1-5,000,000 I think there would have to be a more careful selection of schemes and special consideration given to areas where unemployment Is worst;. It would then be possible to carry on although personally I should prefer to have only a time limit and no financial limit.;   The time limit can be more easily defended on the ground that as these schemes take necessarily a certain time to get started and. to be carried out it is to be hoped that
the advent of the summer and trade revival will render it unnecessary to continue these relief schemes indefinitely.I would therefore propose that Lord St. Davids5 Committee be allowed to proceed, with the schemes already submitted to them and with further schemes submitted before the 1st February, exercising careful discretion with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour as to whether such schemes should be sanctioned, and with a view to keeping as near to the  15,000,000 limit as is possible in the circumstances *A.
