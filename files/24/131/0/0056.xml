^ (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT).SECRET.VISIT OF THE REPARATION COMMISSION TO BERLIN.9ifNote by Sir John Bradbury,British Delegation, Reparation Commission, Astoria, Par!s.21st November, 1921.My dear Blackett,I enclose a short note narrating the course of events during our visit to Berlin.I do not propose at this stage to send an official report, since until we hear further from the Germans In regard to their attempts to obtain credits, the situation is quite indeterminate.I concentrated on the short-credits suggestion partly because so long as there is any hope of getting the January and February payments (which go to Belgian priority) Belgian support for postponement cannot be relied on, and partly because I am convinced of the &quot;mauvaise volonte&quot; of a considerable section of the German industrials, and that, if they can be forced to take responsibility for repayment of short-credits, they will in fact have to provide for the repayment out of their foreign hoards, which otherwise cannot be tapped at all.Also this method of approach brings up the moratorium question in the most convenient form.     The fact that the Commission has given the credits question so much attention makes it very difficult for us to say later, if the credits prove impossible to obtain, that it is possible for Germany to pay without them.     If, on theother
other hand, the credits prove owing to the position taken up by possible lenders to be possible only upon a promise of a moratorium, the Commission will, if it. refuses to entertain the suggestion of a moratorium, find it difficult to report Germany for voluntary default.On the other hand, the only pressure we can exact on the industrials Is the terror of a Ruhr occupation.     I have therefore let the French press this on their own account for even more than it was worth.    It was unfortunate that the &quot;Information&quot; tried to commit me to it definitely by falsely reporting me to have made a private statement to viiirth, which I had to let hi 11 deny on my authority.     But even so I Has able until Saturday to keep up the general impression of unanimous firmness on the part of the Commission, which I think is essential at this stage.Our proceedings after our Saturday&apos;s interview with vUrth were unfortunate,    his statement was certainly disappointing as shewing that the industrials are still playing with the idea of the long date loan (for which In any case there is not enough time).     On the other hand, Boyden and Delacroix felt even more strongly than I did that any public statement which would be interpreted by the French as committing the Commiss- on against any abatement from the full rigour of the Schedule of Payments would be fatal to the continuance of the credit negotiations altogether.I therefore maintained my opposition to an immediate formal pronouncement and though Dubois could have carried it against me by his casting vote (Salvago Raggi unaccountably supporting him and Boydon of coxirse not having a vote) he funked it at the last minute.The recent behaviouja of my Italian colleaguehas &apos;
has been very curious.   He seems to have convinced himself during our Berlin visit that the January and February instalments can be paid and to have become inclined to threaten extreme steps if they are not.This bluff would be admirable if it comes off, but there is great danger of Its playing Into the hands of the French and committing us to reporting Germany for wilful default If the payment Is not in fact made.I can&apos;t suppose that Rome wants this situation to arise, but Salvago Raggl is always more pre-French than his instructions, and if you could find any means for getting him told by his Government to keep his hands free to vote for postponement, if It should prove to be necessary, It would be very useful.I have written this in a hurry as I had only just time to catch the bag.     I shall try to prevent any further developments until I have seen you.     I will come over on Saturday as you suggest, unless in the meantime the situation makes it desirable to get away from Paris earlier.I am rather alarmed at the City attitude as reported to me by Kindersley.If the industrials can be. made responsible for the repayment in foreign exchange of the credits necessary for the January and February payments, I think it is desirable from every point of view that the credits should be forthcoming.I do not want to have to grant a moratorium without making the Industrials bleed - quite apart from the fact that if the matter comes to a head at once, it is not at all improbable that the Commission will by a majority reportGermany
Germany for voluntary default and so make drastic by Prance almost inevitable.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) JOHN BRADBURY.Sir Basil Blackett, K.C.B., The Treasury,Whitehall,    S.VV-.1.
MEMORANDUM -The Commission arrived in Berlin on the night of Wednesday the 9th November-.     They metunofficially on Thursday morning and agreed that it was necessary to seek an interview with the German Chancellor, In the course of which he would explain the general situation, and. in particular, the point which his negotiations with the German industrial interests had reached.This interview took place on the same evening.   The Chancellor informed the Commission that his negotiations had reached a stage where they involved great financial embarrassment since the industrials had jU3t demanded as a condition of raising a permanent loan the transfer of the State railways to private hands.    This condition was, of course, quite unacceptable, but the difficulty might be surmounted either by its being waived or by the negotiations breaking down and thus bringing matters to a head.The Chancellor!s statement was discussed by the Commission, which deputed to Sir John Bradbury and ^onsieur Dubois the task of conducting the further conversations necessary with the Chancellor or his representatives.     The general line which further negotiations with the German Government was tr take was indicated in a note (copy attached) marked &quot;a&quot; ) which was drawn up by the Commission.     The substance of this note was to be - communicated verbally and no written communication v/8.3 to be made, though it was subsequently agreed that the communication would be furnished in writing if the Chancellor thought that this would assist him in his negotiations with the industrials.The point on which mo3t stress was to be laidwas
was that no long term loan offered any chance of meeting the situation and that the German Government must concen-trate upon receiving foreign currency already in the possession of German nationals and on raising through German industrial interests a short term loan to &quot;be secured upon and repaid out of the proceeds of anticipated exports.This line of policy was pressed upon the Chancellor by Sir John Bradbury and Monsieur Dubois, who at the same time warned him of the importance of meeting the payments due in January and February and of the gravity of the consequences of failure which they urged him to take all possible steps to avoid.In the days that followed, the two delegates had various interviews with Herr Schroeder and with various German officials regarding the progress of the Chancellor&apos;s negotiations.     At one of these meetings, held on November 11th, the German officials, while throwing doubt on the possibility of obtaining money by the means contemplated at all,  stated that any negotiations would necessarily requireJ,considerable time in view of the fact that the people with whom the Chancellor was negotiating were not plenipotentiaries but would have to refer to a larger body, and that in the last event it would be necessary to treat with separate industrial interests.The above statement made a very unsatisfactory impression upon the Commission, and the two Delegates were directed to seek another interview with the Chancellor himself, at which they explained that it was impossible for the Commission to remain in Berlin after Saturda?/, the 19th instant.    They requested an interview with the Chancellor on Friday evening or Saturday morning after a further discussion with the industrials which was to take place on the Friday.The
, The Commission decided that this last interview would he attended by the five Delegates.    It was held on Saturday morning and,  in the course of it\ the Chancellor stated that discussion had proceeded so far that the industrials were ready to lend their assistance without the objectionable condition but that they insisted on the necessity of raising a long term loan rather than a short term one with the Intention, if negotiations for such a loan were successful, of getting an advance on such a loan for the purpose of meeting the January and February instalments.     He promised further information within about a week.On the same day the Chancellor wrote a letter (copy attached marked &quot;B&quot;) stating their anxiety to raise the necessary credit and asking for the assistance of the Commission.The Chancellor&apos;s statement was deemed by all the Delegates to be unsatisfactory and the whole of the rest of Saturday was taken up with discussion as to whether the Commission, before leaving Berlin, should address a formal letter to the German Government as to the necessity of meeting the instalments.    The Chairman put forward a text based in large measure on the Note verbal (copy attached marked &quot;6&quot;).     Mr-. Boyden and Monsieur Delacroix were very strongly of opinion that it would be a mistake to write any such letter which must necessarily be made public and they were supported by Sir John Bradbury.     Their chief reason was that the Commission had as yet no solid reason for supposing that the German Government were not in earnest and that any communication must either be in terms 30 strong as to discourage possible lenders and hamper theprogress
Iiprogress of negotiations, or so moderate as possible to weaken the anxiety of.the industrial interests to raise the necessary credits.The Marquis Salvago Raggi feeling strongly in favour of neither view was prepared to support the Chairman, but after a very long discussion, official and semi-official, the Chairman decided that from his own point of view the communication made in pursuance of a decision taken by his own and Italian votes along was worse than no communication at all.Immediately this result had been reached Sir John Bradbury raised the further question whether o-tc not it was desirable to issue a Press Communique, but the Chairman remarked that this was a question in which he disinterested himself entirely and the meeting was brought to a conclusion.8.
La Commission des Reparations,  apres avoir pris connaissance des travaux du Comite des Garanties et ecoute les explications fournies par le Chancellier allemand et ses representants, relatives aux mesures que le Gouvernement allemand a adoptees ou se propose d1 adopter afin d&apos; assurer le paiement des prochaines echeances prevues a&quot;l&apos;Etat des Paisments&quot;, est persuade que les difficultes rencontrees a ce sujet par le Gouvernement allemand, difficultes qui sont intimement liees a la baisse recente considerable du cours du mark, presentment un caractere plus financier qu1 economique. Aucun des elements de preuve actuellement a la disposition de la Commission ne lui permet de conclure que la situation economique de 1&apos;Allemagne soit telle que celle-ci se trouve dans 1&apos;impossibilite de remplir dans leur ensemble les obligations qui lui sont imposees par 1&apos;Etat des Paiements.2.     Les difficultes financieres actuelles sont princi-palement dues au fait que le Gouvernement allemand a manque de prendre er/temps voulu lss mesures necessaires rour equilibrer le Budget, de telle sorte que les depenses pu-bliques ont ete dans une mesure toujours plus grande cou-vertes par des credits accordes au Gouvernement par la Reichsbank et par 1&apos;accroissement de la circulation fiduciaire qui a ete la consequence de ces credits.3-     Jusqu&apos;a ce que les mesures necessarres aient ete prises pour mettre fin a ces conditions financieres defect-tueuses, il est evident qu&apos; II n&apos;y a aucune base solids per-mettant d&apos; entreprendre une operation de credit Se large envergure.En consequence, la Commission insiste energiquementaupres
aupres du Gouvernement allemand pour que celui-ci donne touts son attention aux mesures Immediatement necessaires pour assurer le paiement des echeances due 15 Janvier et du 15 Pevrier prochain-4-     Le Gouvernement allemand doit pouvoir ohtenir les devises strangeres necessaires au paiement de ces echeances au moyen d&apos; arrangements avec les ressortissants allemands qui disposent deja de devises, ou qui seraient susceptibles de se procurer temporarily air erne nt des avances en monnaies etrangeres gagees sur les exportations a effectuer au cours des prochains mois-   II evitera ainsi les consequences graves qui resulteraient necessairement pour 1&apos;Allemagne du non-paiement de ces echeances a leurs dates-.5-     SI le Gouvernement allemand peut par les dits arrangements pourvoir aux neaessites immediates de la situation et, entre la date d&apos;aujourd&apos;hui et celle du paiement de la premiere echeance non visee par ces arrangements, prendre des mesures effectives pear d&apos;ameliorer la situation bud get ai re et monetaire,  la Commission des Reparations estime que, dans ces conditions, la situation -financiers refletera plus exactement la veritable capacite de paiement de 1&apos; Allemagne.
B.The Chancellor of the Reich.Berlin, November 19th,1921.Mr. Chairman.with reference to the discussions I have had with you and the other members of the Reparation Commission in respect of the payment of the instalments of the reparation-liabilities falling due in the course of January and February, 1922, I beg to let you know the following:The German Government take it that on principle and per se it is not In keeping with the sense of the provisions of the London Schedule of Payments to have recourse to the means of a credit.for raising the funds requisite in ord r to cover the annuities,    &quot;with a view, however,, to demonstrate their good will, the German Government are ready to start such a credit operation. As regards the question upon what conditions a loan would be raised, the answer to it would in the first instance be dependent on the proposals of. him who is to lend the money.     The German Government are disposed to try. to procure themselves the credit and even have already taken steps in this direction.     They request the Reparation Commission to be so kind as to assist their endeavours. They, however, feel obliged now already to point out that as concerns the period of the repayment Of the credit an extraordinarily difficult situation will occur in view of the other obligations of the Reich and the German Government expects that the Reparation Commission will take into consideration this exceptional situation.
