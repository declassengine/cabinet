-    448[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January .1922.SECRET.CP.-3587. cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 26th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.With the exception of one or two isolated incidents, the observance of the truce by Sinn Fein during the past week has given no ground for serious complaint. The apprehensions, based on the murders of the previous week, that an outbreak of violence on an extensive scale might be organised by the irreconcilable extremists of the I.R.A. in order to wreck the prospects of peace, have not been realised, and this danger would now appear to be remote. It was not to be expected that the acute divisions in Dail Eireann on the subject of the Treaty would fail to find their reflection in a general restlessness among the rank and file of the I.R.A. throughout the country, but the leaders of both parties in the Dail have shown themselves equally anxious to preserve the truce, and their united efforts in this direction have had a steadying effect &apos;upon their followers. The difficulties of maintaining the truce in the event of the secession of the extremists from the main body of the Sinn Fein Organisation would have been well-nigh insuperable.The most serious breach of the truce during the week was the firing at a police patrol in the Ragg, Co. Tipperary, about mid-day on&apos; the 26th instant, resulting in one member of the patrol (a sergeant) being slightly wounded by a rifle bullet. The assailants, three or four in number, have not yet been identified, but enquiries are being made by.the police in conjunction with the local Sinn Fein liaison officer. Three other attacks upon members of the Crown Forces were committed during the week, but it is doubtful whether any of them fall into the category of breaches of the truce. The worst case was the shooting and serious wounding of a policeman in his own house at Ballyhaunis, Claremorris District, Co. Mayo, on the 23rd instant. This outrage was committed by a single armed and masked man, who opened the door and fired at the Constable at a distance of 2 yards and then decamped. From enquiries which have been made by the police and by a Sinn Fein officer, who was sent down specially from Dublin to investigate the matter, it is probable that the act was one of private malice or revenge, for which the Sinn Fein Organisation cannot reasonably be held responsible. The Sinn Fein authorities express them-selves as satisfied that the local unit of the I.R.A. were in no way implicated. The two other attacks were an unprovoked assault upon three policemen by a hostile crowd in Dungarvan, Co. Waterford, on the 24th instant, and an attack of a similar nature upon an officer of the Staffordshire Regiment at Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, on the same date. In the former case one of the police was badly beaten by the crowd and another Constable was compelled to fire his revolver in self-defence, with the effect of slightly wounding one of his assailants. The attack upon the officer at ivenagh appears to have been the outcome of a series of petty quarrels between soldiers and civilians which had occurred in Nenagh earlier in the day. Although they appear to have carried no firearms, the&quot; crowd became very menacing in their attitude, and after receiving a hard blow on the head the officer discharged a shot from his revolver, ^ whereupon the attackers, who numbered about twenty, quickly dispersed. A civilian who was received into Nenagh Hospital the same night suffering from a slight bullet wound in the thigh is believed to have been wounded by the officer&apos;s fire. A clear breach of the truce was committed by the kidnapping of [7566]
a Constable at Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, on the 19th instant, as a reprisal for the detention in the police barrack of a member of the I.R.A. for the non-payment of a fine imposed at Petty Sessions for an offence under the ordinary law The civilian was released from detention on the 20th instant, the fine having been paid on his behalf, and the Constable was brought back to the police barrack on the same day under an escort of two members of the I.R.A.Other serious breaches of the truce were the firing at and wounding of a civilian at Ashgrove, Newcastlewest District, Co. Limerick, for refusing to accept a Sinn Fein summons to attend an illegal court, three raids upon an aerodrome at Bally-quirke, Youghal District, Co. Cork, in which a quantity of timber and corrugated iron to the value of more than  1,000 was seized, and a raid upon a vacated police barrack at Callan, Co. Kilkenny, in which a quantity of woodwork was removed and damage to the total value of about  100 was committed.Five cases of illegal arrest, in addition to that of the Constable mentioned above, were reported during the week, in two of which the persons arrested are known to have been released.Increase in Ordinary Crime.A regrettable feature of the police reports during the past few weeks has been the increased number of cases of ordinary crime. This is hardly a matter for surprise, having regard to the difficulties with which the police are confronted in the discharge of&quot; their duties, difficulties which are to some extent increased by the restrictions imposed upon them by the terms of the truce. It is a comparatively easy matter in remote country places for raids upon houses and mail robberies to be committed with complete impunity by persons masquerading as members of the I.R.A., and it would seem that the criminal elements of the population are now becoming fully alive to their opportunities. In some districts, notably in Co. Donegal, gangs of armed highwaymen have sprung into existence, and their depre-dations have thrown the inhabitants of the countryside into a state bordering upon terror. A number of raids upon farm houses in Ballymacadden and Letterkenny Districts were reported during the week, and in one case in which resistance was offered to the raiders the farmer and one of his servants were wounded by revolver fire. The latter, and one of the raiders who was felled by a piece of timber in the encounter and was subsequently arrested by the police, have since died. It is satis-factory to learn that the police are receiving all possible support from the local Sinn Fein Organisations and the civilian population in their efforts to deal with the situation.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.No Court-Martial results were promulgated during the week.State of the Police Forces-;The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces: Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.Strength on the 18th December, 1921   ...Deaths   ...         ...         ...          ...          ... 1Retirements        ...          ...          ...          ... 26Resignations      ...         ...         ...         ... 5Dismissals or discharges  ...         ...         ... 14Total wastage         ... 46Recruits ...         ...         ...         ...         ...

Net decrease since the 10th July, 1921 ...1,424 86Dublin Metropolitan Police.The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged throughout the week at 1,134.The labour dispute on the Irish railways arising out of the recent Arbitration Award of Mr. Carrigan, K.C., determining conditions of employment and rates of wages, is still unsettled, and if the declared intention of the companies to put the award into operation is carried out a general stoppage of work may occur in January. In employing the strike weapon at this stage the Irish railwaymen will be acting without the sanction or approval of the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen, which will meet in London on the 2nd January to consider the situation, but the Irish Council of the Union has already intimated that it is prepared to act upon its own authority if necessary. The main issue is the proposed abolition of the universal eight-hours day, the retention of which is declared by the railwaymen to be vital and by the companies to be.an economic impossibility, and there have been no indications, so-far, that either side.is prepared to recede from its present uncompromising standpoint.The failure of Dail Eireann to approve the Treaty before Christmas was received by the Irish public with unconcealed disappointment, but the adjournment is generally regarded with approval as affording a locus p&amp;nitentiai to those mem-bers whose opposition to the Treaty is known to find no favour with their constituents. Although the members of the Dail separated under a self-imposed obligation to refrain from speech-making during the recess, the press and Church activity in support of approval continues with unabated vigour, and has received valuable reinforcement from the independent action of many local bodies throughout the country, which have published resolutions in favour of accepting the Treaty. Resolutions demanding ratification have already been passed by three County Councils (Clare, Longford and Kilkenny), nine District Councils (Cavan, New Ross, Cootehill, Killiney, Milford, Innishowen, Navan, Kilmaethomas and Mount Bellew) -and by the Town Commissioners of Tuam, and special meetings of six other County Councils and two District Councils have been summoned for the same purpose.Railway Situation.Present Political Situation in Ireland.H.
