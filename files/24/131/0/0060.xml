FlIJABCiAI and 10TH3B CONDITIONS lEElATING TO JPHEMSS APPROVED ft the IffiEMPLOY-snt GRANTS lOMMITTBS.4.     With reference to C.U. 58th .Moe-ting ,Concl.3 (4) the Committee had boforo them a letter from the Chairman of tho Unemployment Grants Commit toe to tho Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment (C.U. 334) enclosing a copy of a Memorandum to the Treasury on the work of tie Unemployment Grants Committee.   It appeared that the applications received by that Committee already considerably exceeded the provisicnal limit of ton millions sterling and that most of such schemes would in fact bo eligible for grants. If a limit of ten millions were to be maintained, the Unemployment Grants Committee would haver to commence rejecting Schemes put forward by districts where the need-was not so urgent as in other distriots.     The limit of time by which wo rk . must commence oh schemes, January 1st, required&apos; consideration.    The Unemployment Grants Committee had   over 600 schemes under review, and there would be a large number on which it would be impossible for the local authority to begin work by January 1st.Lord St. Davids, supplementing the information given in tho Memorandum, stated that up to December 18th, 1520 schemes had boon submitted, S70 had either boon rejected or transferred to other Depart-ments, 660 had been approved, and 590 were o at stand-ing.     Tho total value of applications received was roughly  1-5 millions .    Tho valno of Schemes sanctioned was  7,549,000 on which loans had already been authorised to the value of  7,121,000.   The work was proceeding from day to day, and it was
probable that&apos; the total figure of schemes sanctioned would roach 8 millions that evening. The limit of 10 millions would probably be reaehod sbout the&apos;&apos; end of the year.    .Some three-quarters of the schemes wore on the -basis of a Government contribution of 65$ of loan charges for half the loan period, and the remaining quarter wero on the basin of &apos;50fi of interest for a period of five, years,    It was very diffloult to givb a figure of the annual liability of the Government over a number of years owing to the varying periods of the loan.The.,schemes Renctioned would give employment for 280,000 men months.;    if those outstanding were also sanctioned the tctal would bo. 550,000 men months.Mr. Roy stated that on a. rough estimate, the annual liability of the Government could be placed at  40,000. per million of oapital authorised for a period of fifteen years.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport suggested that It - was desirable tg get an. annual figure of tho Government liability over a definite poriod of years.   The figure of  40,000 per million: of. capital would, represent the maximum-possible,. fifteen years being the-longest period for which the Government would bear- loan charges, but as seme of the loan periods were sherter than tfeirty years it would seem that  40,000 was an exoossivo estimate.
probable that&apos; the total figure of sohemes sanctioned would reach 8 millions that evening. The limit &quot;of 10 millions would probably be reached about the&apos;end of the year.     Some three-quarters of the schemes were on the basis of a Government contribution of 65^ cf loan charges for half the loan period, and the remaining quarter were on the basis of 50$ of&apos; interest-for a period of five; years.    It was very diffloult to gi+e a figure of the ameao-X liability of the Government over a number of. years owing to the varying periods of the loan.Theschemes sanctioned would give employment for 280,000 men months.;   if those outstanding were also sanctioned the total would bo-550,000 men months.Mr. Boy stated that on a rough estimate the annual Liability of the Government could be placed at  40,000. per million of oapital authorised for a period&apos;of &quot;fifteen years.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport suggested that it was desirable to get an. annual figure of the Government liability over a definite -period of years.    The figure of,  40,000 per million of. capital would, represent the maximum-possible,. fifteen years being the longest period for. which the Government would bear- loah charges, but as some of the lean periods were sherter than thirty years it would seem that  40,000 was an exoessivo estimate.
*Lord St. Davids said that with tho restricted staff with which-he was working it was impossible to produce further statistics in the time at their disp osal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to see what could bo done to meet lord St. Davids in the matter of staff.   -The Chancellor of the Exchequer pioceoded that it was necessary to. state the position fxackly to the Committee.     Lord St... Davids naturally wanted to know the position in which he stood5. and the Committee must understand that the Treasury were not in a position to do anything further.    They were being met perpetually by the demand for the reduction of taxation,   Bvon at .tho present level of taxation expenditure must bo reduced by&apos;175 millions this year without .allowing for the additional burdens imposed by the Irish settlement.   With the best will in the world It., would, ba impossible to provide further funds for. tho relief of unemployment, and he was not prepared to consent to any increase&apos; of: the burden already imposed.The Chairman suggested that, the relief obtained by not having to. pay unemployment benefit of f 15/- a week in tho case of men employed on relief work should be set ,against -the Government contribution to the cost .of the works,, and he was&apos; not &apos;sure that the Government, would not save money. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that ho had no evidence that there would be any such
saving. &apos;  If the State had..jto^fina^cmey^cur^he-^arp-ose of relieving&apos; unemployment, they would do mere harm to -employment by the Imposition of additional taxation than any benefit that would be derived from relief works.     He was obliged to resist the argument that a slight increase could not effect  the Exchequer posit ion *     It was an argument with which he was oonfronted from all quarters * and the cumula-tive effect of small additions was bound to have a disastrous effect.The Minister of Labour was of opinion that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was unduly stressing the burden which would be placed upon the Exchequer by increasing the limits of the capital works Which the Unemployment Grants Committee might sanction.-    It was in his view most. important to. bear in mind that the .Unemployment Grants Committee.. were in- faot the only body that had been, able to put In operation any schemes of a really satisfactory character..    Ho doubt the Export Credit Scheme, was operating well,, but its effects were obscure to the public.- . The Eindersley Committee on the other hand had not yet been, able to sanction any of the Schemes submitted to them..The Chancellor of the exchequer enquire&apos;-1 what limit to expenditure on unemployment the Minister of Labour-proposed to fix.The Minister of Labour .said th&apos;t that must depend on the state of unemployment in the.future.The Chancellor of&apos; the Exchequer suggested that this was asking for an unlimited credit with the Treasury.   The real limit was the ability of the Nation to pay, and that had been reached.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport suggested that the Committee should lay down a/
a sum which was not to bo exceeded in any, future year as the annual liability of the Government, say,  500,000.   The real limit was the annual charge, not the oapital commitment-It was, t erefore, essential that the annual liability of the Government which was not yet&apos; known should, be determined. It should also be remembered that the limit of 10 millions was not a Cabinet decision.-      It had. merely been agreed at the Committee that that limit should not be exceeded without further reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Committee.The Chairman was of opinion that there would be very great political difficulty on the meeting of Parliament if the Government were obliged to admit that although there were many applications from local authorities outstanding, they could not be carried out because the Government could not afford, the money.     The liability Of the Exchequer would not be unlimited because there was only a limited number of local authorities in the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer repeated that the limit of the Governments offer must depend upon the state of the country&apos;s revenue.     If the sums found for the relief of unemployment resulted in producing an Exchequer deficit,  it would in effect increase and not decrease unemployment.     He had stated quite frankly to the Committee when the schemes now in operation were sanctioned, that he was not prepared to go beyond the sums then placed at the disposal of the Ccmmittoe, and to that he adhered.     It was obvious that no other Minister could appreciate so well as the Chancellor of the Exohequer the financial . position,  and the situation was such that he could not oontemplate any further commitments.     Ee had lately been/
been in three of the biggest industrial centres and all the deputations he had received had urged upon him the necessity for reducing taxation.

The Commitee agreed -

With reference to the Government Scheme for assisting Local Authorities by way of sharing loan charges on loans raised for capital works under taken in relief of unemployment: -

To refer to the Cabinet the question whether the Unemployment Grants Committee be authorised to sanction capital expenditure by local authorities in excess of £10 millions.
