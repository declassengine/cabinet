SWEDEN,.No new Naval shipbuilding programme is contemplated for any vessels larger than destroyers, submarines and. mine-layers.   The chief difficulties in the development of the Swedish Submarine service are the shallow waters along the Eastern coasts and In the archilepagos, and the lack of effective training in submarine work of naval, conscripts with only 225 days service.PART II,      GENERAL INTELLIGENCE.EGYPT.Adly Pasha handed his resignation to the Sultan on the 11th December which was accepted.The Sultan saw Sarwat Pasha who has courageously come forward and is willing to form a new Ministry.Negotiations are now proceeding between Sarwat Pasha, Lord Allenby and the Foreign Office as regards the former&apos;s proposed declaration of policy.SIBERIA.The Maritime Provinces Republic (Vladivostok) now under the presidency of Herkuloff, a White anti-Bolshevik leader, has commenced operations against the Far Eastern Republic (Chita) v^hich is practically a Soviet dependency,,   General Kappel is in command of the troops of the Maritime Province Republic.GERftANY.The Conference of Ambassadors have given their Consent to the construction of a military airship In Germany for the United StatesHUNGARY.The Oedenburg plebiscite began on the 14th December and according to the Press,  the Hungarian scored a decisive success in the Town District, whilst the Austrians obtained a slight majority in the country districts.

Some people in Athens believe that the trouble in Crete has been artificially engendered, in order to divert attention from the failure of M. Gounaris&apos; negotiations.The number of insurgents is estimated variously as from 250 to 1000.   An ex-officer named Menirakie is stated to be their leader,     So far, although there have been a lot of shots fired there have been no deaths and few cases of wounding,, The insurgents have issued proclamations demanding that Crete shall be declared a neutral Greek zone under Allied Control.Another Greek battalion and additional guns and machine guns are being despatched to Crete ,RUMANIA.M.Take Joneacu, Minister for Foreign Affairs, resigned on llth December o   His resignation was followed tfo- days later by that of the Premier.
