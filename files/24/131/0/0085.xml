.Wr-J *43THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC 1JMMH1 s GOVERNMENT . SECRET,. CABINET..P.3583 . HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE . *lLRATING OF. MACHINERY.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister, of Agriculture and Fisheries .The Minister of Health has circulated a memorandum, (C.P.3563), proposing that legislation should he introduced with the object of assimilating the law with regard to the rating of machinery in England and Wales to that in Scotland and Ireland.The effect of such legislation would be to reduce the assessments of factories etc. containing machinery, and conse-quently would relieve manufacturers etc. of part of the rates to which they are subject at present at the expense of other classes of rate-payers.T think it is necessary,  therefore,  to warn the Home Affairs Committee that any such legislation has always been vigorously opposed by agriculturists, and that their opposition would be stronger than ever at the present time when agriculture is passing through a period of acute depression and when occupiers of agricultural land are pressing for some relief from the crushing burden of rates.It is certain that any legislation of the kind pro-posed would be highly controversial, and I suggest, therefore, that it would be inadvisable to introduce piecemeal legislation in the interests of a comparatively small section of ratepayers and to the disadvantage of a much larger number, many of whom have much stronger claims to any relief that can be given from the burden- of rates.A.G.B.28th December,  1921.
