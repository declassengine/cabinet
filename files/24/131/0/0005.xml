.4    30[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;CONFIDENTIAL.&quot;CJP. 35bb&quot;TVie Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby (Cairo). (No. 1255.)My Lord, Foreign Office, November 19, 1921.IN ray final conversation with Adly Pasha to-day, while explaining to him the procedure as regards publication of which the Cabinet had approved, I told him that in my opinion he and his colleagues had made a mistake, as soon as they had realised that their extreme demands could not be conceded, in not accepting, or, if that was too much, in not expressing their willingness- to treat the British proposals as a provisional arrangement to which, in their own interests, they would be prepared to give a trial, in order to demonstrate, by the good administration inaugurated and the perfect security obtained under it, how mistaken the apprehension which bad justified the British refusal of wider concessions had been. Taking the parallel of the ascent of the Great Pyramid as representing the &quot;Egyptian aspirations for independence, they had claimed to be transported by aeroplane straight to the summits instead of mounting by laborious stages, as all of us who ha 1 scaled that great monument had been obliged to do. In the present case the British Government had offered to help them, as the Ai-abs were in the habit of doing with visitors to Ghizeh, more than half-way to the top. But apparently the Egyptian Government, if they could not get there straight away, preferred to remain stationary at the base.Adly Pasha asked me why we should not proceed ourselves to put into operation scheme (AV For the very obvious reason, I replied, that this could only be done with Egyptian co-operation ; and yet he himself, the man most competent to give it, had told me at our previous meeting that his first step on returning to Egypt would be to resign.I told him that the Egyptians could not have it both ways. They could not both enjoy the luxury of refusing our proposals and posing as national heroes in consequence, and at the same time expect us, without their assistance, to put into operation the scheme of very considerable independence which they had! chosen to reject. The only consequence of their action would be to throw us back into the status quo ante, which would be equally regrettable for both parties.I said I understood the difficulties of his position. But I rather wondered why, on the one or two occasions on which I had suggested the possibility of a provisional arrangement, to be replaced, after satisfactory experience, by something more liberal or advanced, he had turned down the suggestion. 1 invited him, while on his return journey, to consider very carefully whether on arriving in Cairo it would not be in his power to make to the Sultan and to your Lordship some proposal more in harmony with the facts of the situation both here and in Egypt, than the attitude of blank negation which he had hitherto assumed.The Egyptian Prime Minister was far from rejecting these ideas, which 1 had made with the object of allowing them to germinate in his mind before he arrived in Egypt although, naturally enough, he could express no acceptance of them. He left me with the warmest expression of thanks for the courtesy with which he and his colleagues had been treated at the Foreign Office and for the hospitality which they had enjoyed in England, and I could certainly say in return, as T did, that 1 had found him a very sincere and honourable negotiator with whom it had been a personal pleasure to deal.I am, &amp;c.CUMZON OF KEDLESTON.421-X   [7346]
