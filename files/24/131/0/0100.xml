TinS J&amp;OjnflgijT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT. I SECRET. iC.P. 3598.CABINET.GENERAL REGUTATION OP MECH^lNICALLY-PROPELLEDMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.A Departmental Committee has been sitting to consider the existing regulations relative to the use on road a of mechanically propelled vehicles with a view to the Institution of a general code of legislation more in conformity with the existing traffic conditions and developments than the statutes under which these vehicles are now regulated.The Report of this Committee emphasises the necessity for immediate legislation to cope with the conditions upon which both the Royal Commission of 1906 and the Committee presided over by Mr. Edward Shortt which sat during the years 1915-1918 have already urged legislation.The developments of Motor Transport have outgrown the existing powers of regulation, and, particularly in tho case of commercial vehicles, the regulations are inappropriate and difficult of enforcement.     In Borne directions they are , unduly restrictive, and in other cases afford too great laxity.The institution of a proper code of legislation  s urgent, and the longer it Is postponed the more difficult will it become to Institute a system which, while properly securing public safety and the reasonable use of the highways, will not inflict hardship upon those whose business it Is to manufacture or to operate road vehicles.There are now differing codes of statute and regulations applicable according to whether a vehicle by reason of its weight or method of construction or use comes within the legal definitions of a &quot;locomotive&quot;, a &quot;light locomotive&quot;, a &quot;heavy motor car&quot;, or a &quot;motor car&quot;.     The result is confusion in the trade and the application of different regulations in different local areas In respect of the same type of vehicle
aocording to tho views held toy the authority aa to the particular definition applicable to that type.It is essential that there should be established with the least possible delay a code of provisions applicable to all meohanieally propelled vehicles on roads, together with special regulations applicable to any special type which calls for special regulation, such special regulations being made under powers sufficiently elastic to enable any further development in the construction or form of road vehicles to be suitably dealt with.This will render it necessary to consolidate and amend the existing law and to obtain additional powers, of which the principal are:SPEED.There is now a statutory limit of 20 miles per hour on the speed of all motor cars other than heavy motor cars and there are regulations in respect of all heavy vehicles limiting the speed in some cases to 12 miles per hour, in other cases to a lower maximum.     It is common knowledge that these limitations on speed are generally disregarded and the enforcement of the existing law is, in the view of all the interests represented on the Committee including the Police Authorities, impracticable and under modern conditions under irable *The Royal Commission of 1906 recommended the abolition of this speed limit.     The Committee agree with the Commission and recommend the abolition of the 20 miles per hour speed limit in respect of lighter types of vehicles, but provided that they are fitted with pneumatic tyres and limited in axle weight and/or seating capacity.     For heavier types, where it is necessary to Impose some limit on speed for the protection of road surfaoes and structure, the existing maxima will be raised but in no case beyond 20 miles per hour.     Whether there should be a total abolition of the
general speed limit or whether that limit of speed should be increased ia a matter of policy upon which a decision is asked for.     In the view of the Committee the public safety can be better secured by some modifications in the existing law relating to dangerous driving than by the Imposition of any definite limit of speed.     They emphasise the fact that if any inoreased limit is fixed it is apt to be regarded as the normal pace at which a vehicle may proceed on any road, and while it may unduly restrict speed on open country roads, it apparently admits of a speed whioh in the case of many roads would be undeniably dangerous.    Their recommendations are that if it be made an offence to drive a motor vehicle on the public highway in a dangerous manner, having regard to all the circumstances of the case the administration of the law will be considerably facilitated, and In connection with this they recommend the provision of a uniform system of road sign-posts indicating the necessity for special caution, and the use of uniform signals to be given by drivers when stopping or turning.    They suggest that in cases of prosecution for dangerous driving, the failure to observe tho caution indicated by the sign-posts or to give the prescribed signals should be a matter of which the Court deciding the oase should take special cognisance *DRIVING LICENCES * The Committee have also considered the question of drivers licences, and whether or not some test of technical efficiency and physical fitness to drive could be applied before a person Is licensed to drive a motor vehicle on the road.    The Committee have come to the conclusion, in which I concur, that it would not be practicable to apply such tests and any attempt to do so would require the institution of some mechinery which would have to be extensive and costly to maintain without effecting any practical result.    The Committee, however, suggest that every person drivir&quot;   or steering a mechanically propelled
vehicle should bo required to declaro, on applying for a licence,, that he is not suffering from disease or physical infirmity which might render it unsafe for him to drive or steer such vehicle on the roads.The Committee further recommend that all persons in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle, whether   as driver or steersman, should &quot;be required to take out a licence.     The driver or stecroman of a locomotive is not now required to take out a licence.ACCIDENTS -   REPORT OF AND INQUIRY INTO..More ctringont provisions are req\iired aa to the procedure to be adopted in the event of accidents due either to road conditions, or in which more than one vehicle is concerned, or in which personal injury or Iocs of life occur. The present obligation is that the drivor of the vehicle or vehicles concerned should stop, and, If required so to do, give his name and address.     In the event of an accident in some lonely spot where the victim is either killed or stunned, the driver has committed   no offence under tho Motor   Car Acts if he has stopped, even momentarily, and has not refused, upon being asked for it, to give his name and address.     It is proposed that if the driver   fails to render such assistance as he can and to report the occurrence to the Police, he should be deemed to have committed an offence under the Motor Car Acts.The modern conditions relative to road traffic make it desirable to institute a system of enquiry into accidents. At present there is no formal inquiry unless an accident be attended with fatal consequences, in which case the matter comes before the Coroner.     Cases have come to light where accidents have been traced to constructional imperfections in a particular make of vehicle, of which many may be upon the road, and a proper system of inquiries might result in bringing to light more of such cases.     If, as suggested above, an accident is to be reported to the Police they can refer their records to the Minister, who should bo empowered. If the
facts so warrant, to undertake an inquiry under procedure similar to that under v/hich he at present investigates accidents upon Railways.FURTHER POWERS TO ACQUIRE LAND AT DANGEROUS ROAD&quot;c^gssiMGsT^c^     &quot;Stress is laid by the Committee upon the la ok of sufficient powers to acquire land and buildings at dangerous corners and cross roads, to remove or reduce the height of hedges and fences, and to cut back overhanging or projecting trees, The existing powers in this direction are limited to procedure by way of Provisional Order or Special Act, and authority is sought to Institute some readier method under which Local Authorities ,can obtain any necessary powers.GENERAL.A large number of technical matters arc dealt with in the Committee&apos;s Report relating to the distribution of weight per axlej   the number, size and construction of wheels and tyres j   the width and length of vohlcles;   the extent to which vehicles may overhang the back axle;   tho number and nature of brakes, and other matters for which a power under which the Ministor can make regulations is required,i ask leave to introduce a Bill to amend the existing law in the directions above indicated, and that the matter should be referred to tho Commit toe of Home Affairs.(Signed)   ARTHUR NEAL.5th January, 1922.
