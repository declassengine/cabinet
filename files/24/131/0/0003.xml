[This Doeument is the Property of Ris Britannic Majesty^ Government.]- -EASTERN (Turkey). [November 19.]CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[E 12735/1/44] No. 1.Minutes of an Interview between Lord Curzon and MM. Noradunghian, Aharonian, General Bagratouni and Mr. Malcolm, held in Lord Curzon&apos;s Room at 12-30 P.M., November 19, 1921.M. AHARONIAN expressed gratitude for the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovern-ment in regard to Cilicia, which he regarded as an indispensable lever for obtaining from Turkey a solution that took proper account of the Armenian position and claim. Kars and Ardahan had already been handed over to Turkey. If Cilicia were now similarly abandoned it would be a fresh catastrophe, which would involve the throwing away of all means of getting any terms for Armenia. The situation of Russia was such that she soon might be forced out of the Caucasus and the Turks would then walk in and massacre. The Eastern question must be settled before such a possibility materialised. For this purpose Cilicia should be used to make the Turks fulfil their obligations, and not returned to them before the Eastern question and especially the Armenian question was settled.Lord Curzon replied that the Armenian delegation should say that at Paris rather than in London.M. Aharonian said that he had seen MM. Briand and Franklin-Bouillon. The latter recognised the relation between Cilicia and the Armenian question as a whole. In reality Cilicia concerned all the Allies. All that M. Franklin-Bouillon could or would say was that Mustapha Kemal was an honest man who would do no harm. No real guarantee of any kind was offered to the Armenians for their safety; could not something be done by the other Allies to postpone evacuation by the French ?M. Noradunghian pointed out that the minority provisions in the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement were wholly inadequate. The French could! only say that there would be French consuls at various points in these regions. This was obviously no safeguard. The Franklin-Bouillon Agreement was disastrous in that, apart from the special Armenian interests, it raised the prestige of Mustapha Kemal and lowered that of the Allies. Surely, if the Treaty of Sevres were modified it must be done by all the Powers, and not by one. At present he feared that the last remnants of the Armenians were doomed.- Could not Great Britain propose a special mission which should enquire on the spot as to the real wishes of the population, which was a mixed one? Any such enquiry would reveal a vast anti-Kemalist majority. If France maintained that the protection of the region was a question of money, could not the Allies &apos;see their way to assist ? It was to be anticipated that America would be willing to contribute. He asked whether Lord Curzon would advise the Armenian representatives to send a telegram to the local population urging them not to S.ee, at least for the time being.Lord Curzon replied that the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement had been made without British knowledge. We had regretted it and were now in correspondence with the French Government. The French reply must be examined. As the Armenians knew, he had always taken an interest in the Armenians and had done his best for them. The French reply, especially in so far as it concerned the protection of the Christian population, would be very closely scrutinised. He agreed that the Treaty of Sevres could not be replaced otherwise than by common consent of the Allies. There would soon be another Supreme Council for remodelling the Treaty -of Sevres, and the Armenian case would then be heard. They would recollect that stipulations had been made in Armenia&apos;s favour at the time of the abortive negotia-tions with Bekir Sami&quot; Bey earlier in the year. As to the despatch of a commission, he could not pronounce definitely. The French were retiring hurriedly and the proposal presented obvious difficulties. He would examine the French reply as soon as possible, and the Armenian delegation must trust him to do his best for them. He warned them, however, that the matter was much more difficult now than last year.  Nevertheless, he would consider the suggestion submitted.[7234 t.....1 j e
