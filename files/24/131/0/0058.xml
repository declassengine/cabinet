^[T^lJgocimMit is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] &quot; &quot;SECRET.MEMORANDUM PREPARED IN  THE TREASURY.Reparation in Kind.A REPARATION liability which is beyond Germany&apos;s capacity threatens catastrophe in Germany, and is on balance disadvantageous even to the recipients. So long as the liability is so huge that Germany cannot see her way, however strenuous her efforts, to meeting it, the position is without hope both for Germany and for the receivers of reparation. The present watering of the paper currency of Germany threatens catastrophe in Germany and is detrimental to the whole world. Until the liability has been so rearranged, and the sums due in the next few years so&apos;reduced as to make it possible for Germany to meet it, and at the same time balance her budget, it is futile to discuss methods for taking payment in kind.The essential first step is to arrive at the figure of what Germany can pay in the next few years on the assumption that payment is made in cash (plus coal as at present). It is only when this step has been taken, and Germany is being given a breathing space during which she can restore financial order at home, that it becomes useful to discuss how far she can be helped to pay the minimum sums fixed, and, if possible, to accelerate her payments by being allowed to make payments in kind.The Loucheur-Rathehau Agreement, and any proposals for similar arrange-ments between Germany and this country, must therefore be discussed in a hypo-thetical atmosphere, on the assumption that the first step of reducing the liability to manageable proportions has already been taken.But supposing this to have been accomplished, what are the advantages to be gained by arrangements for payment in kind instead of in cash ? The first and most obvious advantage is that Germany is thereby enabled to regain access to markets which have been closed to her by the prejudice against her, excited by her war record. This is important, but does not help towards meeting the objections of those who argue that British and other industrial interests will be damnified by the competi-tion of the goods which Germany will export in order to pay reparation. The questions requiring answer are, therefore, first, Will British and other industrial interests be injured by the payment by Germany of large sums on account of repara-tion % and, second, can such injury be avoided or lessened by arranging for payment in kind ?Now the British nation regularly received very large and increasing sums each year before the war in payment of interest and profits on money employed abroad. The amount so received cannot have been much less than  200,000,000 net by 1914. Yet the British nation had not much more difficulty than other industrial nations in keeping its people profitably employed. This large net income from abroad was devoted partly to improving the average standard of comfort or luxury in these islands and partly to making fresh investments abroad whereby the less developed parts of the world were enabled to progress, and by increasing their consuming powers to increase the demand for British products.Why, then, should it be disadvantageous to the British nation that it should receive an extra  30,000,000 a year ? If the analogy of our pre-war income from abroad is to be relied on, we could use this either to improve our standard of living or to increase our foreign investments. The Exchequer would be able to use this receipt to make a corresponding reduction in its demands on the taxpayer, and incidentally if the debt to the United States Government remained unsettled could itself do the equivalent of investing abroad by paying off external debt. The British manufacturer would escape his share of taxation to the amount of  30,000,000 a year, and the German manufacturer would pay that amount extra, so that from the point of view of industrial competition the money would count twice on a division in favour of British industry. The advantage thus gained would seem to offer complete compensation for the lower costs of production in Germany which might be expected to result from the depressing of the general standard of comfort of the German workman, even if the somewhat untenabler [7406]
assumption be accepted that the German workmen&apos;s standard of efficiency would not be impaired by his lowered standard of comfort.It is clear, therefore, that the general statement that it is bad for a country to receive payments of the nature of reparation is at least open to qualification. Provided only that the recipient Government is not encouraged to some useless extravagance, or, as it might be better stated, provided that the recipient Government uses the money wisely, the argument so far points to the contrary conclusion.But, it may be said, Germany will have to export such a large volume of goods to all parts of the world in order to pay reparation that there will simply be no room for British goods, and the amount of unemployment which now exists in the United Kingdom will become chronic. This argument, however, depends largely on the tacit assumption that the consuming power of the world is more or less stationary and that German goods can find a market only by ousting other goods, and especially British goods. It is also further coloured by the particular circumstances of the present moment, when a collapsed exchange makes the costs of production in Germany ridiculously low in comparison with costs of production in the United Kingdom. Arguments derived from this temporary condition of affairs are, however, invalid once it is admitted that large reparation payments are practically impossible so long as Germany is financing herself by watering her paper currency, and that the attempt to exact such payments until the German budget has been restored are both futile and detrimental. The assumption on which the present analysis is proceeding is that the reparation liability has been rearranged and is being met without resort to currency inflation.The assumption that the consuming power of the world is a more or less fixed quantity is also in essence a mistaken deduction from existing conditions. The statement that Germany must ba given time to set her finances in order has its converse in the statement that in order to enable Germany to pay the consuming power of the Avorld must be given time and opportunity to increase so as to absorb Germany&apos;s extra production. When in the days before the war British money was invested abroad, its beneficent effects served to increase the consuming and producing power of the world pari passu. The German reparation obligation is a heavy addi-tion to the indebtedness of one country to others involving a heavy addition to the producing power of Germany, if it is to be paid, but it does nothing in itself to increase consuming power. It is true that as it is paid, it necessarily adds some-thing to the consuming powers of the recipient countries, and a corollary of its receipt by the United Kingdom must be an increase of British investments (or payments) abroad, and such additional investments abroad must serve to increase the world&apos;s consuming power. But the obligation of Germany to pay is an immediate one and the additional consuming powers of other countries are still in the future. Moreover, so long as Germany&apos;s capacity to pay is in doubt, the prospective recipients dare not count on receiving payment and cannot therefore set new enter-prises on foot in anticipation of receipts from Germany. The position would be much altered if Germany were making regular payments and the recipient countries were framing their budgets on the basis of a certainty of getting receipts from Germany. There would then be some hope that the normal play of economic forces and the intelligent working of normal market methods would themselves provide for a gradual increase in the world&apos;s consuming power to synchronise with the gradual growth of Germany&apos;s payments under a sliding scale, increasing year by year to a maximum which at present looks impossible.It seems, therefore, as if there is&apos;a transition period to be bridged, during which arrangements for payment by Germany in kind might well contribute to the smooth working of the reparation system. The Louchaur-Rathenau Agreement, provided that the varying interests of the recipients of reparation can be duly safeguarded, offers an admirable illustration of how payment in kind might assist. France must necessarily restore the devastated areas as quickly as possiole. She is, as a matter of fact trying to do this so fast at present as to threaten her own financial stability. She has banked on receipts from Germany which are certainly not forthcoming as soon as she expected, and one of the most dangerous problems of the moment is how to rescue French credit if the reparation schedule is rearranged so as to fall within Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. It will not greatly assist the world if the mark is rescued at the expense of a collapse in the franc. But assuming some, solution to have been found for this problem, the Loucheur-Rathenau plan will enable France to accelerate her programme of reconstruction pari passu with the increase in Germany&apos;s payments.  Such reconstruction will provide automatically the additional
consuming power required to absorb Germany&apos;s additional production, up to a corresponding total. And in the next stage the world at large will benefit by the additional consuming power of the restored French regions.Can this country enter into any similar arrangements % The problem is more difficult than for France because there are no devastated, regions crying out for reconstruction. Moreover, even in France there is serious ground for doubt whether the special deliveries by Germany can be so regulated as altogether to prevent French industry from being damnified. With this country this danger is very much greater. Here comes in a consideration which has been ignored hitherto in this analysis. Before the war the creditor countries were mainly those with highly-developed industrial capacity, and the debtor countries were mainly undeveloped or under-developed areas producing mainly food and raw materials, It is true that European investment abroad was largely instrumental in enabling the United States of America to develop a large industrial capacity. But this process developed pari passu a large new population of consumers, and there can be little doubt that the world as a whole has no reason to complain of the results. But in the new after-the-war situation, the biggest debtor, Germany, is a highly-industrialised country, and as it happens her natural industries are very much the same as those of the United Kingdom. Moreover, the chief post-war creditor, the United States of America, has no experience of foreign investment, and will not naturally divert her available surplus of investable capital away from the undeveloped territory within her borders to the development of distant lands. In this new situation, therefore, there are two factors which make the analogy of pre-war foreign invest-ment difficult of application. It may perhaps be assumed that somehow or other the problem of the United States of America&apos;s creditor position will provide its own solution, either by large United States investments in other parts of the Americas or by such an acceleration of internal development in the United States as will make her a large consumer of foreign-goods and services, and so restore the balance. But there will still remain the problem of German competition with parallel British industries. Granted that in the last analysis Germany can pay reparation only if the world&apos;s consuming power develops part passu with Germany&apos;s extra production, is it not certain that Germany&apos;s extra effort must be concentrated mainly on the development of her specialities, such as electrical engineering, iron and steel, dyestuffs, &amp;c. ? If so, the corresponding British industries can escape serious difficulties only if the world&apos;s consuming power is expanded proportionately to Germany&apos;s extra effort, not merely as a whole, but also in regard to electrical engineering, iron and steel, dyestuffs, &amp;c. Unless this happens, the benefits of reparation receipts by the British Exchequer will be seriously diminished by the dislocation in British industry consequent on the gradual transfer of British effort to other industries, and by the loss of national strength consequent on the diminution of the importance of these particular industries in the United Kingdom in so far as they are of the nature of &quot; Key Industries.&quot; The possibility of Germany paying any substantial amount to this country &quot;in raw materials is not worth serious examination.The questions at issue, therefore, narrow themselves down to : 1. Is it permissible to look for such an expansion of the world&apos;s consuming power in those of the big industries which are specially important both in Britain and in Germany ?2. Can this expansion be assisted by an arrangement for payment in kind to this country on account of German reparation ?It is impossible to answer the first question with any certainty. But it is, at any rate, possible to look for a very considerable expansion. It was to a very large extent these particular industries which were most completely diverted during the war period to the production of munitions and warlike stores, and it was in exactly these industries that the potential demand at the time of the outbreak of war showed most signs of expanding. The electrification of railways in this country, and, indeed, throughout the world, is in its infancy, and once the uneasy transition from war to peace is over, there must be immense arrears of work all over Europe and elsewhere which have been neglected during the war and now require to be caught up, as well as destruction requiring to be made good. If only Russia were to be reopened for development on a scale unknown before the war, the capacity for expansion would be immense.The main danger is that an attempt to expand particular industries more
rapidly than others may produce a disequilibrium and eventual over-production in these industries, and the initiation of vast projects in advance of their date such as happened with railway development in Canada.This last consideration at once suggests the need for caution in dealing with any question of Governmental action to expedite, e.g., electrical development in connection with an arrangement for receipt of reparation by this country in kind. Government action in this matter will be peculiarly susceptible to all dangers of Government intervention in industrial projects, and there will be more than the usual danger of schemes being adopted which are financially unsound or unripe. This difficulty will be increased by the dilemma that either a scheme is good enough for private enterprise to embark on it without Government help, i.e., the scheme can be financed without recourse to reparation, and may therefore be expected to employ British products directly or indirectly if Government does not intervene, so that Government intervention means employment for Germans at the expense of Britons, or the scheme is not a sound one. The case in which Government intervention and German deliveries in kind are justified is the case where a good scheme cannot be started for want of capital, and the prospect of German reparation provides just the additional capital needed, and German reparation cannot be paid unless the scheme is started.It is obvious that Government intervention to promote the right scheme will have to be unusually enlightened. None the less, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that, pending the moment when reparation is working smoothly, there is room for such Government intervention so as to promote additional consumption of the products of those German industries whose out-turn must be stimulated in order to enable Germany to pay reparation.It remains to consider one or two further conditions of Government intervention: 1. With taxation and debt at their present level, the Government ought not to finance capital developments at the cost of the British Exchequer. The Exchequer ought to secure the whole value of reparation payments in cash, and if deliveries in kind are accepted, individual British citizens ought to buy them from the Government and pay cash for them. In other words, reparation must not be an excuse for extra expenditure by the Government, even out of capital. Any big scheme that may be initiated must raise money from the open market and not depend on Government funds.2. Reparation receipts hy this country must necessarily involve some addition to the annual amount invested abroad by this country, especially in the earlier years. British industry can only keep itself in full swing if there is a net annual surplus of investments abroad by British investors. Reparation being an addition to the receipts of this country from abroad must be balanced by some addition to the sums invested abroad. In the earlier years it is probable that this country will have to increase its investments abroad by a sum equal to the whole amount it gets from reparation. It may also have to lend something to Germany to enable . her to pay France her share.In these circumstances, though individual schemes for, e.g., electrical develop-ment inside the United Kingdom, might conceivably be suitable for financing out of reparations in kind, this could only add to the real consuming power of the world if somehow or other a corresponding investment of British capital abroad resulted. It is more probable that, to secure the necessary increase in the world&apos;s consuming power, the schemes to be financed out of reparations in kind should be geographically situated outside the United Kingdom, so that investment abroad would be secured, at the same time as the development of a consuming power for German products. Such schemes may very naturally be sought for in the undeveloped British possessions overseas, where, subject to the two conditions that funds are provided without recourse to the British Exchequer and that the danger of attempting too much too soon is avoided, there is a real prospect of rapid development of new consumers for the goods which the world is anxious to produce and the pari passu development of new producers of the food and raw materials which the world will need to support such extra production.o
