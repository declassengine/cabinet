v\a -Ln^sj 4wi    g  P. 3546.S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENT. GRET.CABINET. ^OIL   IN    THE   UNITED   KINGDOM. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a note by the Seoretary for Mines in regard to Oil in the United Kingdom.It seems clear that we shall not progress any further towards a decision by allowing the Duke of Devonshire^ action to go forward and I do not think we shall have any chance of settling with him on terns more favourable than we can obtain at present.   Moreover, as I under-stand, it has now been ascertained that oil in the United Kingdom is not likely to become a commercial proposition, and this would be our justification for our change of policy in regard to royalties.I therefore recommend the line of action proposed in the accompanying Memorandum, and would urge that an early decision may be given in the matter.(initialled) S.B.14th December,. 1921.
OIL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.This matter was disoussed at a meeting of the Cabinet on 7th March, 1921 u&amp;^ftO) at which the Cabinet wore askod to decide between the alternatives of (a) introducing legislation to acquire the property in oil for the Crown and (b) recognising private ownership in oil and withdrawing thoir ban: on tho payment of royalties.   The following decisions wore recorded:-(a) That the draft Petroloum Bill should not be intro-introduced and that legal prooeodings instituted by the Duke of Devonshire should take their course.(b) . That, subject to the result of tho duke of devonshire&apos;s action, the Preoident of the Board of Trade should be authorised to negotiate with Mossro Pearson for the cancellation of tho agreement.(c) That, as provision would still be necessary in thoestimates, tho Chancellor of tho Exchequer should be authorised to make suoh provision in the way he deemed beet, after consultation with tho President of tho Board of Trade and the Minister of Munitions It will perhaps bo most oonvonient to take these paragraphs in the reverse order.   As regards (c) tho necessary provision has been made under the vote of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission.   Expenditure is now on a considerably reduced scale.As regards (b), 8 of the 11 wells drilled have been wholly or partially plugged with a view to abandonment, one is producing, and two are being
temporarily kept open for further work as there is still a possibility of finding oil.   No further wells will be drilled and the agreement with Messrs. Pearson will automatically terminate as the work is completed.   At least  350,000 of the  1,000,000 fixed in the agreement will not be spent. If any expenditure is incurred in 1923-3 it will ho very small.As regards (a), the Attorney General is of opinion that on tho pleadingo as at present framed under tho action taken by tho Duke of Devonshire no decision will be obtained on the general question of ownership of oil in this country.   Ho advleoa that tho statutory dofenoos which oan be sot up under section (l), of the Indemnity Act, 1920, should not bo withdrawn because in his opinion they are an effootive answer to tho Duke of Devonshire&apos;s claim for damages for trospass and wrongful ealo of the oil in quootion.   It is, therefore? probable that if tho caso prooooded to trial tho Duke of Devonshire would fail in his claim, but that the question of the ownorahip of oil would bo left just whoro it stands at present.   It la not known whether in that case tho Duke of Devonchiro would institute a frosh action and again endeavour to obtain a decision on tho question of ownorship.   If ho took this courso, it soems certain that ho would bo ouooesBful. As far aa is known, oil is in overy country alwayo regarded as the property of the landowner in the absence of definite legislative enactment to the oontrary.It appears, however, very impolitio to allow this matter to remain.unsettled for a further
indefinite period.   In some cases applicants for licences to drill for oil under tho Petroloum Production Aot, 1918, have been waiting for two years pending a decision on tho question of ownership, without which they can make no progress.It may be mentioned that, even if oil were declared the property of the Grown, hp practical effect oould be given to the decision without such a right of ontry as was provided for in tho draft Petroleum Bill which haB beon abandoned under Cabinet direction.In view of the unsatisfactory position which has been reached I havo discussed tho matter privately with tho Duke of Devonshire and I find that he is prepared to forgo hiB claim to the oil already won and to take over th plant on.the site at a valuation, on condition that hija right to the remainder of tho oil produced is reoognised and that he or his nominee is given a licence to work tho aroa on tho usual royalty basis,I desiro to urge very strongly that a settlement on these lines with the Duke of Devonshire should be ^approved.   But it is impossible to make it so long as the declaration made in tho House of Commons stands that no royalty should be payable to tho landowner, for the Duk must of course bo left with a free hand.   I hope therefore that this decision will be reversed.   The Government Policy of inaotion in this matter has boon strongly criticised from time to time in the technical press, and although it is not certain that any vory extensive operations would be commenced in the near future somo private enterprise is undoubtedly being prevented from gotting towDrk by the present indeterminate position.
It loot us the opportunity that presented itself some timo ago of reoovoring from Messrs. Pearson the inonoy that we have spont on boring and it would be unfortunate if wo lost also this opportunity of making a favourable bargain with the Duke.(Initialled) W*CeB.
