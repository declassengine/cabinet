Public opinion seems to be.increasingly.confident that the- , &quot;Treaty&quot; will be ratified. * The, newspapers and, local todies continue to...press for this and&apos;--only:&apos;:i/n&apos;-&apos; isolated&apos;&apos;-cases such as BAH THY and&apos;&quot;CAHIfiOiyjSJSa do opponents . of rat if ieation make any organised protest. - These, bodies and the. armed rebels who support them are said not. to be representative either of the civilians or of the I.B. A-.    This is probably.&apos;the casey hut. the recognised leaders of   &apos;Sinn F\ein, having.-taught and encouraged every form of outrage, cannot he surprised to find; that many -of those whom they have ins true tod wi 11. continue to. look upon crime as their recreation, if. not their, means of livelihood,    The-: following incidents which have occurred recently illustrate&apos; the lack of control which, the leaders have over such extremists.On December 24th.,; Hunstanton House -near.&apos; TULlA-MCHiil was vacated by troops.    The house, belonged - to a Mrs.&quot; Waller : Sawyer , who herself lived at Moystown.House close by.    Between December,24th -25th&apos;, Hunstanton House was raided, by armed men who maliciously damaged: the Hou.se. and looted, some of the contents..    On December 25th, armed men raided luoystown Houee, assaulted Mrs.. Sawyer, pulling her hair, -knocking her;.down and iiicking her, - She managed to escape through a window by the help of two of the raiders, &quot;while the /remainder of the .party were searching for a gun end threatening to shoot her..    This matter has been taken up with the . liaison officials and it is believed that . they - are endeavour-ing to/trace trie criminals.On -December 25th,.a:Sergeant of the .Boyal- Scots. Fusiiiere was he Id. up in TjJLLAIviOBiS by tnroe civilians, who having; made insulting /remarks about his uniform, knocked him down end kicked &apos;him uh/ti-l he became unconscious.   The -Sergeant and the civilians were&apos; all sober.On December 27.th .at MACFCOQH a party of armed rebels stole the Ford&apos;Car ^belonging-to ..a District Inspector A, I. 0,    The driver who&apos; was -In the Gar was blindfolded .and driven away.    The rebels stated&apos;that&apos; they had wanted the District Inspector and that&apos;&apos;they /intended to shoot him..Many instances have occurred of raids -and thefts of goods from Bail way -Stations during Christmas time.   Sore than ten. cases&quot;have been&quot; reported within the last fortnight-    Some of these are due to the&apos; boycott of English Goodss but in several cases Military&apos; Stores have been stolen from Railways.Strong protests nave bean made to Liaison officials regard-ing &amp;he above incidents, but the reply to these protests has been; either that the reports we have received are a misfopre-- - A___&apos;-- s e n t a t i o n of. * * *.
of&apos; the facts, or that the outrages were committed by men for whom tiie I., H, A. accept no responsibility.   Liaison seldom haa anymore.) satisfactory result than this.I am more than over convinced that &quot;unless troops are withdrawn .from Southern Ireland with the utmost despatch after ratification of &apos; the &quot;Treaty&quot;, they will find themselves in a very difficult and unpleasant position.(Sd.)
