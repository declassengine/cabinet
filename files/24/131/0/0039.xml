Thomas&apos; libel case.Communist officials have been asked to forego one-sixth of their salaries in order to assist the Party funds.The Moscow Exeoutive of the Communist International of Youth has sent an interesting communication to the Oommunist Party of Great 3ritain regarding the Young Communist League.
THE UNEMPLOYEDLittle change in the unemployment situation.is reported:    in some districts revolutionary leaders are becoming irritated by the apathy of their followers, but in others, notably the East Midlands, the organised unemployed appear to be yielding to oommunist influence. From^the provinces generally, great opposition to the scale of pay for relief work is reported, and small &quot;strikes&quot; of the unemployed continue to occur.There&apos;have been no large demonstrations in the Metropolitan area, during the weokr   on November 30th 0ant. stated at Bast Ham that the unemployed organisations &apos; had &quot;gone&quot;just as far as possible&quot; and that a better understanding between the employed, and unemployed was now necessary.     He added:    &quot;If the. unemployed were to start ..   looting at. this juncture we should lose - this plan was thought&quot; of but turned down.11 .. Tactios which havo been foreshadowed in previous reports were adopted by a party of unemployed on December End:    over 100 men entered a Lyons1 tea-shop at&apos; k ....Clapham Junction and ordered refreshments;   they stayed long enough to prevant a number of the rogular customers obtaining accommodation and are-reported to have made speeohea and sung songs.     On leaving /the men paid a small sum&apos;each.   &apos; - &apos;&quot;A new unemployed committee composed entirely of ex-Service men has been formed in viestminster:   about 60 ex-Service men attended the first meeting, which was enthusiastic.The unemployment position.in Lancashire and Cheshire appears to bo becoming more acute:. last week there were S2 ,368 wholly unemployed and 75,934,partly unemployed names on the live registers, a total increase of 15,554 on the previous week.Unemployed/
Unemployed meetings are held in several Lancashire I towns almost daily and are for most part very orderly: in Liverpool, however, the leaders are aotive communist4 and extracts from the last roport of my corrospondents, who maintain close touch with the situation, tear quotation:&quot;Leaders like Bra&amp;dook, Hi eld,, Laughland, DewaJ and Tissyman, of the Liverpool Unemployed Committee] boast thoy are out for reVolation, the finding of employment for the workleas hardly ever being montioned just lately.     The Liverpool unemployed have been formed into an ^rmyV   They are divided into seotions, each seotion having a aeotion command After the meetings which are held dally in Islington Square, one in the afternoon and the other in the evening, the sections are ordered to fall in to thei respective commanders, afterwards forming four deep and marohing through the principal streets of the city.   In oonsequenoe of this attitude, tho Police have had to interfere with the programme from time to time, so the unemployed leaders have for the lastj week been urging the unemployed to bring weapons In their pookets, in order to defend themselves from attack by the Polioe, who are alluded to as &apos;3e3picable cura&apos; who take a delight in batoning thej men whom they are paid to protect.&quot;Through being Put of work ao long, the men are getting desperate and they hang on the words of the speakers, and the more revolutionary the utterances the more they applaud.   It is plain to se that the men now start on their marches looking for trouble and only the great taot and patience shown to the Police, who aocompany the procesBions in large numbers, has saved serious trouble,&quot;The unemployed are greatly incensed at being turned out of the Stadium and at not being able to get a hall In whioh to hold their meetings, and we fear that unless tho activities of these leaders are checked, there will be trouble in Liverpool before -  long.     The men are poor, hungry and desperate, and amongst them are those good enough for anything - &quot;bxitl work,&quot;On Deoember 4th a meeting, organised by theunemployed committee, was held in the forecourt of PembroJtChapel, Liverpool, to protest against the &quot;deliberatebrutality of the police towards the workleaa anddestitute.&quot;     About 2,000 people, mostly unemployed%werepresent.   The Rev. 3. Vint Laughland called the police&quot;uniformed/
&quot;uniformed brutes&quot; and announced that he and othermembers of the unemployed committee were going to holda public enquiry into the &quot;Art Gallery affair and theother two occasions when defenceless men were batonedwithout cause&quot;:   the enquiry would be held in PembrokeChapel before a jury of Liverpool citizens.     Laughlandadded that &quot;if the Police in Liverpool did not tako oaro,some of them would be found down some side street of liverpool some morning and that if the Liverpool Policewere going to baton the men whom they were paid to protect,then they could not blame the unemployed of Liverpool ifthey took the necessary measures for protecting themselves,because the unemployed were entitled to be protected just as much as any other citizens.&quot;     His concluding remarkswere greeted by loud and prolonged cheering.Braddock also spoke and the following resolution waspassed unanimously:&quot;That this mass meeting of citizens of Liverpool hereby register its strongest protest against the wholly unjustifiable attacks of the Police upon the unemployed while engaged in peaceful demonstration , and calls upon the V/atch Committee to immediately order an enquiry, and see to it that the offenders are immediately dismissed from the Police Force, which is paid to protect all citizens, and not to attack them.&quot;My correspondent reports that there is a good dealof hardship in Glasgow and that in streets of the city thereare many ex-Service men begging from house to house withtheir families:   in some cases these men find it difficultto carry on with small pensions and disabilities and expose-their wounds in the hope of elioiting help.     Applicationsfor ejectment decrees in the Courts number hundreds dailybut the Lord Provo3tfs mrnd to assist the unemployed inpaying their rents is proving a welcome innovation.&apos; The/
THE COMMUNISTS       &apos;The communists are greatly, perturbed by the fact that the sum of  3,000 has been awarded to Mr.&quot; J.H. Thomas M.F., as damages in his libel action against tho National labour Press, Francis Meynell, Arthur MacManue and Percy Howard.     The damages have boen the main subject of conversation at the International Socialist Club:    some members suggested that Moscow might pay the money but, others thought such help Improbable;   the latter have so grounds for their fears as Zinoviev severely reprimanded the British delegates to the   Third Congress of the Third International for the futility of &quot;The Communist&quot; cartoom during the miners&apos; strike,Branches have been informed by Headquarters that cartoons from &quot;The Communist&quot; are being reproduced and wil be supplied at l/6 per hundred:   branches are to sell thafl for what they will fetch and it is hoped by the executive that a substantial sum will be raised towards the cost oil the libel action.There seems little doubt, however, that, unlessWLmHussian&apos;help is forthcoming, the Communist Party will havlmgreat difficulty, in raising its portion of the damages. MI iOn Deoember 2nd the acting secretary wrote to the divisional organisers:: &quot;As you. are probably aware the.Party at the present time is passing through a very serious financial: crisis.&quot; Whilst there-is reason to hope t the situation will eventually right itself when the plans, have matured that we have in hand for raising funds nevertheless the position at the moment mckes it absolutely essential that every effort should be made to cut down the expenditure of the National Organisation.....&quot;An Immediate out in the general administrate! expenses of the Party can be secured in one of thre&apos;1 &apos;v*:&apos;:-    ways: ?(a)   &quot;By cutting down the number of those in the   j &quot;Party&quot;s employment.HIw 1
(&apos;b)     &quot;By a general reduction in the salaries of the indoor and Outdoor staff.(c)     &quot;By all members of the staff, whp are members of the Party, agreeing to a voluntary . weekly levy 6n their ssiaries in aid of theParty Maintenance Fund it is proposed to set -  on foot.&quot;The first course Is one that we do not desire to see applied so long as it can possibly be avoided. The financial situation may possiblo right itself in two or three months time:   should this be the case it would prove regrettable if we then found&apos;that the services of comrades in.Various departments, who have become practised in their work, had in the meantime been dispensed with and were no longer available because they had found work elsewhere whereas if the present rate of salaries is reduced and a reduotion in the staff thus avoided it would be possible to restore salaries to the present rate if and when the financial situation rights itself.&quot;We feel that the policy should therefore be one of equality of sacrifice all round and no cutting down in the number of the staff until that course becomes imperative.    This being the case it resolves itself into a choice between proposals fb) and (c) and at a meeting of Heads of Departments held last evening it was agreed seeing that an immediate reduotion in the salary list is inevitable it would be better that this should be secured by a voluntary effort on the part of the members of the staff rather than by a decision of the. Exeoutive Committee.&quot;I have therefore to submit for your consideration the following proposal., - that all members of the Party who are in the employment of the Central Office receiving a salary of more than  4 a week agree to hand over one sixth of the amount weekly to the Maintenance Fund to oommence December 10th...&quot;The National. Organiser has asked Robert Stewart to consider the possibility of acquiring cheaper premises for the Glasgow headquarters:   this week Stewart has received 23 for salaries,  11 for organising expenses, a promise of  18.7.8. for rates and taxes on or before December 7th and a promise of a remittance for municipal taxes.The following financial statement from the scottish office/

THE COMMUNIST INTERACTIONAL 01? YOUTHa good deal of correspondence, some of which is incoda, is passing between the Communist Party and theleaders of. the Young Communist League in England end the berlin Bureau.     The following is a translation of adooument dated October 20th, 1921, Moscow:&quot;To the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot;Dear Comrades, t&quot;The Executive Committee of tho Communist International has been informed that you have recentl, taken the initiative in forming a united communist League of Youth and that you have entrusted James Btewe*rt with the work of organisstion.   The Executive Committee welcomes this work of the Communist Party of Great Britain and sends you this letter in order t . draw your attention to the necessity for the speedy extension of this work and to advise you regarding it practical basis.&quot;The present situation is comparatively favourable for the Communist Youth Movement in Bnglan There are in your country none of the opposing social patriotic and reformist youth organisations which are combating the Communist Youth Movement in other oountries.    In this respeot the Communist Youth Movem in England is in a better position than the communist party whioh is opposed by the great Labour Party.   Th situation must be exploited to the utmost in order to form the Communist Youth Movement of Great Britain ini a mass movement of young proletarians.   The formation of a strong Communist League of Youth will be of greal importanoe t* the collective communist movement of Great Britain in so far as the Communist Youth Organisation will be that branoh of the Communist Movement which will penetrate deep into the masses of young proletarians and thereby further the developmen of the party into a mass party.   Therefore Lt is neoessary that the Communist Party of Oreat Britain should devote, without exception, all the means at it disposal to support the growing League of Youth.   V/e suggest that you should send a oircular to the branche drawing attention to the importance of the Communist Youth Organisation and setting forth in concrete form the oonneotlons between the Youth Movement and P^rty the necessity for the support of the former by the latter,&quot;The first task of the Communist Party of.Great Britain in regard to the Youth Movement ia to help inthe/
the extension of its organisation.   All branches of the Communist Party in towns, in rural districts, in trades unions where there is, as yet, no branch of the Communist-league of Youth must form one at onoe in conjunction with the leaders of the League of Youth,   That&apos;can be done&apos; either by dividing the younger members of the Party into speoisl nuclei of the League&apos; of Youth or by the formation of special party committees, whose business it will be to form: groups of the League,     Care must be taken that the nuclei take root at once in the trade unions and that the indifferent young proletarians in the&quot; .organisations be brought in.       *   -   ;&apos; oi&apos;&quot;The Third Congress of the Communist International decided that there should be an exchange of representatives in the committees of the Communist Parties and of the Communist leagues: of Youth.     The second task of the Comuiinist Party of Great Britain is quietly to carry out this decision in regard&quot;&apos;to.-the Communist Youth Movement.,   The.exchange of representatives must result in both organisations., being well informed,in their work being oo-ordinated; and in mutual support.   The exchange must exist&apos; not only&apos; at the head of- both organisations but right through&apos;,; that is, from the trade unions oells&apos; and branches.&apos;.&apos;&apos; right up to the exeoutivs committee^   The party organisations- must send as their representatives the most capable comrades who will not merely be present at the meetings of.the Youth Organisations but will also help them in practical ways by means of advice, propaganda, etc., naturally without giving the appearance of dominating.     The party organisations must demand regular reports from them comrades and must always be au fait with the activities of .-the Youth Organisation.&quot; .&quot;The branches of the Communist League of Youth of England&quot;already in existence must be.strongly supported by the party organisation.; Attention should be. given particularly to the communist instruction of its members, a matter whioh the Communist League of Youth cannot oarry out without trie help of the Party, The Party, must help the Communist League of Youth by the provision of agitators, propagandists, leoturere, literature, courses of instruction, tise&apos;of the; Party Library and all branch rooms., in order to develop a broad organisation in the oommunlat sense/ the aim of which is to incorporate the broad mass of the Young proletarians and to educate the members as olass-conaoioue communists.&quot;The Communist Youth Organisation is not an educational union which is concerned only with education, but a school of Communism, an organisation whose members must be&apos;educated to Communism through taking an abtive part in the proletarian class war.   It Is the task of the Communist Party to draw the members o the Communist League of Youth into the work of the United Party.   The members of the Youth Organisation must be present at all public meetings of the Party in order to gain practical experience,,   They must also be present at the meetings of&quot;the craft and industrial cells of the 3?arty.     (in each case without the right to vote).   In all big campaigns and in&apos;all actions of the Party during elections, strikes, strugglesinside/
inside the trade unions, Hands off Russia aotivi Press propaganda, illegal work, etc., the Youth Organisation must help the Party and talco over part of the work.     We wish to draw your attentl to the necessity of devoting great attention to Youth Movement in the Party Press.     By means oi Pre us all members of the Party and workers must informed about the tasks and the praotical methods of the Communist Youth Movement.&quot;jVe hope that, the unification of the Qommun Youth Movement in Great Britain&apos;.and the form&amp;tio gr^eat Communist League of Youth, supported by ths Communist International of Youth on.one hand and you on the other, will be quickly consummated, emphasize onoe more the importance of this work, communistic greetings,&quot;Executive Committee, of the Communist YouthInternational.&quot;The English organisers have been instructed to sjregularly to Moscow for the Central Archives of theCommunist International of Youth:60 copies of all party publications such as newspapers, books, leaflets and posters.&apos;10 copies of all publications of opposing organisations. ... ; ,      . &apos;,10 oopies of any publications issued: by trade uni - for apprentices.Moscow also requires two oopies of the most imp or army orders, military service orders, the most importa orders regarding the position of juveniles, in Civil la circulars of the-&apos; Ministries of Labour and Health, othe circulars jjelating to sohool and continuation*sohool&apos;n and publications concerning ecpnomio and social ouestiAll correspondence has to be sent to Berlin in triplicate, as oopies of all documents intended for Mosoow are kept in Berlin.   ...Ah exhaustive cxiestionnairs has been sent to Engl to be filled in:     the questions asked cover so many details that they are quite inappropriate for the preventive state of the movement in this country.-      * ;        .; ;  :    ; &quot;le-x&apos;.:       .:-]\ &apos;        &apos; The./
