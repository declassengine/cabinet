One of the Bolshevik couriers mentioned therein has landed in this country.Acting on the instructions of the Comintern, communist officials are getting into touch with disloyal Indians in London.The present membership of the Communist Party is approximately 7,000.Norman Ewer has gone to Russia, ostensibly &quot;to make arrangeV911^8 in connection with the &apos;Daily Herald&apos; Russian News Service.&quot; Interesting information regarding the crisis in the affairs of xti$ &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is given in this report.Ex-Colonel Malone proposes to resume his communist activities.The General Council of the Trade Union Congress has decided to refer back to constituent unions the Engineering and Shipbuilding Group&apos;s proposal for combined action in grave labour disputes.Discontent in the South Wales and Northumberland coalfields may lead to sectional strikes.
THE IMBMPLOYISI)There has been a further decrease in the number of wholly unemployed, who totalled approximately 1,814,500 on December 22nd as against 1,022,837 on December 16th: short time workers on the live registers numbered approximately 275,522 on December 16th:   on the same date the number of men reported to &quot;be employed on relief works was 111*780.Attendance at unealloyed meetings appears to bedecreasing, in London and in the provinces, but Russianinterest in the organisation of the unemployed on arevolutionary basis has not waned.     LOBorsky has recentlyrequested the notional secretariats of the ThirdInternational to work for concerted action of the world5sunemployed and has suggested, the following grouping intofederations:United Kingdom GermanyAustria and the Balkan countriesPranceItalyScandinaviaHe recommended a campaign covering:Work or full maintenance Demonstrations before and after Christmas Individual and organised strikes againstpayment of taxes. Protests to Governments Hunger riots and looting of shops.Losovsky is of opinion that the Spring of 1922 willhe a suitable time for mass action by the Europeanunemployed, as by that time distress may have increased.If the present temper of the majority   of British unemployedhe maintained, however, there seems little probability of mass action in the revolutionary sense.   Demonstrationswere organised on Christmas Eve and on New Year&apos;s Eve,in the first case for the West End and in the latter at st../
-   -St. Paul13:     the response was very poor and although some oftho London District Council are reported to have advocatedthe use of pepper against the police, the,? have so far not found supporters sufficiently foolhardy to carry out theirwiqheo.     There is still dissension among some of theunemployed committees in the London area;   Hanson- of Jnlharahas &quot;been thrown over in consequence of his dictatorialattitude and -the Borough Council has withdravm permission--forthe unemployed to use the Public Baths for meetings&apos;, owing tomisconduct.    Tho Tottenham unemployed, committee has declined to accept provisions which have hitherto been providedgratis by local tradesmen:    the bread given amounted toabout 400 loaves per week and the .Committee, which is composedof single men, states that charity is not a substitute forwork;    the married unemployed, seem likely te&apos;-&apos;oppose theCommittee^ action. ; --&apos;        &apos;--Robert Jones of the Zensihgton Unemployed, who was bound over in November to be of good behaviour, inconsequence of a seditious speech, is, attempting to form a&quot;London Unemployed Benevolent Society&quot;:   present indications are that were this society formed the benefit would  0 chiefly to Jones, in the form of a salary of  400a year and to the Committee.   Funds would be raised by  -street collections, if these were authorised.Meetings are being held by the organised Unemployedto protest against the imprisonment&apos; of ^-&quot;Inspector Syrne,but the attendance has in no case exceeded 20 V&apos;-The following letter, written on January 3rd by theorganiser of Ho. 6 area to the London District- Council isa good example of the outlook of the extremist -unemployed:&quot;I am locking forward to greater activities, covering bigger aroa taking place simultaneously, thereby compelling law and order to keep their tools at home, instead, of at present able to transfer them according to our plans.   Well, we have been as busyas /
as possible.   The Dartfprd-Erith arterial road job is costing; a good deal more and keeping a strong force of nolice,: including conscoks, than it would by-paying the T.U. rate of wages.    I keep them there merely by having&apos; a run round the job myself each day, and keeping a fow people hanging around, thereby koepinrr thorn guessing.&quot;The friction between the Communist Party and theNational administrative Council of Unemployed to which reference Was made in report No, 136, finds esrireasion ina letter written recently by R.V. Harvey from Leicester tohis headquarters:&quot;Have you had any communications from B&apos;ham district re the mess at the Conference?   They have wangled Vfakefield out by as dirty a scheme I have mot yet.&quot;Understand I state here and can.prove it that Wake field is far and away the host man in tho Midlands vkilst Brain   has less knowledge of the job than I have. Anyhow I am going to 3&apos;ham this week-end and I am fighting the C.P. for all I am worth.&quot;This Conference unless immediately tackled will about wreck the Midland Unemployed Movement.&quot;I am advising Smothwick to cut themsolvos away from B&apos;hara, and to lot B&apos;hara&apos; stew in their own juice (albeit I am concentrating on Bruin) that will save Smethwiek from being drawn into the same innocuous inertia that is a characteristic of Birmingham.   One example.   At Manchester   Wakefield accused Birmingham Comrades of sitting in   3offee Shops.    Strange enough when I reached Birmingham Bull Ring at 3 p,m. FrT&amp;ay 23rd, found a good crowd ready for a meeting and inside the Co-op Coffee Shop was Lecky - Brain- - Emery -Spencer - enough for a doaen hours speecn.   Seems as though there was some truth in Wakefieldls accusation.&quot;Wakefield has been here 11 days and watching him work I am still more convinced that he Is one of the best tacticians we possess, and you, would do well to have, him In London to advise you how to organise.,What the Hell is Leckie doing with that permission.of the N.A. C.   Take the thing off the Tool.&quot;lily Midlands correspondents - report that unemployed agitation decreased somewhat during the, holiday season but that the men on road making schemes are working half-heartedly the Trust Navigation Scheme is an exception as the men are working with a will in the belief that the scheme will be of lasting     benefit to&apos;Nottingham.       The pottery workers in North Staffordshire now have normal employment but there is much depression in the iron industry.   The motor trade in Coven try shows signs of revival and. the men hope that the worst /
worst of the slump is over.   Agitation in Leicester has died downsince the departure of Wake field and Harvey, but the unemployment situation is still serious,    Jennett is e:rgocting to be released as his brother-in-law in Canada has offered to provideono surety of  50 for his good behaviour and Poorge. Lansbury isstated to be finding&apos; the other.No improvement in tho situation in Lancashire and Cheshireis reported and there is considerable   distress in liverpool and Manchester:   the Communist Committee in Liverpool continuesto hold processions but the attendance is decreasing1 slightly,owing possibly to the activity of the anti-Communist Union.   InEochdale a loyalist Committee is receiving support from thepublic, but, by moans of threats, the comminist committeeinduced a number of men to stojo relief work for one day last week;they resumed the following day when promised adequate protection.In Yorkshire thero appears to be little&apos; change in theimemployment situation but the organised unemployed are, on thewhole, quiet:   a proposed reduction of 10s. per week in reliefpay is causing uneasiness in Sheffield.. On December 27th a joint conference of the South WalesAssociation of Labour Members and the South Wales Council ofUnemployed was held at Cardiff:   Mr, Morgan Jones .M.P. was inthe chair and the speakers included Messrs. Mardy Jones, TomYoung, T, Wat kins, A, Jenkins, George Dolling, A.J. Cook,T. Davies and V/. Lewis:   the following :cevolution &quot;was -passed:&quot;That this conference invites all South V&apos;al es local authorities to refuse to function unless the Government provides them with the means of dealing adocsuately with : unemployment, and, that the South Wale3 coalfield and its seaboard be treated as a unit.&apos;r .A second resolution was carried, by 38 votes to 26, vailingupon the Government to recognise and enforce the inalienableright of every citizen of the Realm to work at a living; wage orpublio maintenance; declaring that the minimum scale of living -adopted by the National Council of Unemployed was a just and..-reasonable scale for both employed and unemployed; pledging therespective organisations represented at the joint conference to under take]
undertake joint action to bring pressure to bear upon all Govenrment departments to provide sufficient financial aids to enable them (l) to proceed with public utility vroxke at Trade Unic rates for the unemployed, and (2) to provide adoquate maintenance j by way of public relief on a scale providing 366. per week for man and wife jointly, 5s. per woek for each child up to sixteen years of age , 15s. v/eekly rent and rates allowance, plus one cwt I of coal, or itg equivalent in gas;   30s. per week for single persons over eighteen years of age, and 15s, per week for adolescents sixteen to eighteen years of age at hoiae, with the allowance of coal or gas for adults living in separate apartmentsfOn December 17th and 10th a conference of unemployed organisations was held at F^lkirk;   most of the delegates were Communists:    the following is a copy of a secret report on this conference:&quot;ComJ,1orton of Edinburgh acting as convenor in his opening remarks gave a brief report of the rise of the movement in England.   Com. Clarkson of Falkirk was appointed! Chairman and Com. Park of Cambuslang was appointed Secretary of&quot;tho Conference.   Standing orders Committee were appointed; as follows:   Cora. Morton, Bridgeton; Cola. Brown,   Sovan and Townhead; Com. Smithies, Edinburgh; Com. Laing Leith; Com.;&apos; j M. Laughlan, Broxhurn.     Taking all the reports into consideration they pointed to mass organisation of the workers springing into being, which would ultimately bring the present   system to the ground never to ri3e again.   It was unanimously agreed that we affiliate-to. the N.A.C . and become a division of the National Movement.     The Scottish Divisional Council were appointed from the Conference as follows:   Chairman f, Clarkson, Fislkirk; Divisional Secy. P. Park, C-imbuslang; Tres. P.J. Oallacher, Dumbarton;   Rational Organiser South West, A. Crapbe11, Vale of Leven; North Bast B. Foulis, Edinburgh;   Members of Council T. Morton, Bridgeton, A. McGeach:n, Creenock, E. Corr, Sp-ringburn,  J.A, C^tpbell, Leith, all these posts to be duplicated.   Com, I?, foulis was appointed delegate to N.A.C   It was agreed that Com. Morton of Edinburgh and Com. McGeachan of Groenock would, collect all new3 of importance pertaining to Unemployment and send it on to the Editor of &apos;0ut of ttork1.&quot;The recommendation of Standing Ord.ers Committee that the Local Committees be the Unit of Org anisatlon wi th Local Autonomy and that Districts shall set up District Committees in such areas as the Districts themselves shall decide was endorsed by the Conference. &quot;The next item on the A.:.enda was affiliation to Trades Council and it was agreed that all Committees have Local Autonomy in this matter, also that all candidates for Parish or Town Councils band in his or her written resignation to the Divisional Council prior to nomination.   It was resolved that all such&apos; candidates givt a report over;&apos; month, concerning Unemployed, also that a deputation from&apos; the Unemployed- Trade Union Congress andLabour /
Labour Party be heard at the Bar of the House of Commons on Unemployment.   The next item for discussion was &quot; he Ratification of National demands, whioh were carried with the addition of the resolution by Leith that the hours of work be. reduced so as to absorb all the Unemployed in this country.&quot; &quot;   -My Glasgow correspondents report that there is no improvement in the unemployment situation in their area and that the majority of works, have closed for a holiday of 10 days instead of the usual 3 or&apos;4.   The unemployed committees are agitating for the abolition of queues outside labour exchanges.TJEE5 COMMUNISTSParticular importance attaches to a letter, dated Moscow December 4th, 1921&apos;,&quot;&quot;&apos;which&apos; has been sent to the Communist Party of Great Britain by Jules Humbert Dros on behalf of. the  . Komintem:    taken in conjunction with the document reproduced in Report Ho. 135, this letter affords additional proof of the direct control by the Komintern of revolutionary propaganda in this country:&quot;To the Communist Party of Great Britain.&quot;At its last sitting the presidium of the Communist International considered your letter of protest regarding the Mission&apos;which was to go to England to control - the activities and finance of the Party. &apos; The Presidium unanimously regrets that Comrade Frits has not carried out the. mission which, the Executive entrusted to him.   The Presidium has decided to write to Comrade Erils to tell him to go to England immediately and to take with him another comrade, who will receive from us personal instructions regarding the work which he is to do.    The Presidium has asked these two representatives not merely to confine themselves to financial control of the Party, but also to discuss with you its general activities, its policy, and its future activities *   Wo will personally give detailed instructions to the comrade who will accompany Eriis.&quot;Y/e hope that this work will be done without delay and that in this way our relations with the. English Party will be made &quot;regular and will become closer.     We acknowledge the receipt of the reports which accompanied the letter of Comrade MacMaaus and wo again insist that your Party shall send a delegate to tho Executive Committee of the Communist International   It is possible that at the end of January the Executive will convene a meeting of the Executive Committee and will then invite oho or two delegates from each country to discuss the great problems, which will -concern the next Congress.   You will receive.:further confirmation and an official invitation but you should &apos; now make preparations to send one or two delegates tothis /
this meet in...&quot;Secretariat of the Eomintorn&quot;Jules Humbert Droz,&quot;Priis has landed in this country and attended a secretmeeting of Communists on December 31st:   a second courier,who is probably tho companion to whom reference ia made inthe above letter, is also reported to have arrived.   Triisis the For we; ion who came to England as. a stowaway at theandbeginning of last yoar/ attended the Leeds Communist conference, bringing with him, according to report,  1,000 for the Party.The present membership ox the Coinmunist Party is approximately 7,0*00 and as many of the members are unemployed, it ia arithmetically impossible for the Party to be financially self-supporting.    There is an unconfirmed report from a foreign source that a large Quantity of jewellery has recently bo en passed out of Russia, re-set in German settings and sold for the benefit of revolutionary societies in Europe.Arrangements are being pushed forward in connection with the Russian film and lantern slides:    Coates appears to be running the committee and is trying&apos; to obtain the support of various &quot;Left&quot; Labour leaders.   Whitehead has gone to America.In the following letter to Maclean us, C. 1&apos;Estrange Maione, who was sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment in connection with the &quot;Red Officers Course&quot;, announces hi 3 intention of returning to the Communist fold:&quot;I don&apos;t know v/hether you have noticed that I was back at the Gas Works last week as soon as my sureties expired.    It seemed a good plan to lie low whilst these were hanging over me and not jeopardise the two comrades&apos; cash..,&quot;Now/
&quot;Now I am ready to go on with the good work. I shall be back in london permanently at the beginning of January,&quot;A few months back I got a letter from the CP, telling me I was no longer a namber, I hope it wa-s only somebody11 s humour.&quot;The Cartoons of 1 Jimmy5 in last week&apos;s &quot;Communist&quot; were grand and I took care to leave a pen and ink reproduction of tho central piece of you and J.H.T. in 1 Please Sir he called me Jimmy&apos; - on the bench at the House of Commons, which was collared by Jos, Wedgpwood, who has taken it home to frame.,&quot;Tho appointment of .13.H, Brown as organiser for the Communist Party in&apos; the Yorkshire division in succession to Ebury has aroused a storm of protest from hia comrades:   Itoyle, the secretary of the Sheffield branch has informed headquarters that:&quot;We realise the reactionary character of the democratic formalism which dominates the Yorkshire division, but we also see the danger cf another formalism - that of bureaucratic routine.   We suggest that it is farcical to invite the Division to partake in the selection of en organiser, and then ignore its decisions on the matter,,   We hope-,   therefore,, that Comrade Brown will not be introduced in face o f the oppos i ti on shewn...&quot;He adds:&quot;In regard to the Divisional Council, as now oor.si.-j.imted, we consider it has shewn itself a grotesque and costly failure^   We suggest the unconstitutional, but an ti-formalist, idea of. hcrapping it.   Our alternative is tho setting up of a Council or management committee for-West Yorkshire. Leeds.. Bradford, Huddors field , etc, and another for South Yorkshire, Sheffield, Retherr.aei, V/uodhouse, Mesbord *Doncaster and Bamsiey.&quot;These present natural Industrial groupings, and should have direct contact with&quot;Bead Office.     Hull and Crimsby presents another natural organising unit, but couldbe/
- 9 - . 499be tagged on to Sheffield area if not competent to stand alone.   The South and West are entirely, out. of touch, and have different concrete problems to face, the one organiser1 could, still function and tho present Div. Council could simply fade away.&quot;Bell, the national organiser, admits that on Doc ember 10th the Yorkshire Divisional Council refused Brown!s appointment by 8 votes to 7, but alleges that Sheffield, Parsley, Shipley and Castleford support it:     the opposing- votes were case by Bradford, Grimsby, Leeds, York and Doncaster. He is optimistically convinced that &quot;the majority of the members in Yorkshire will agree with the change.&quot;Efforts are being made to organise the women1 s section of the Communist Party and Helen Crawfurd has been touring branches with this end in view: she is favourably impressed by the possibilities in Glasgow and Dundee but states that in Edinburgh there is little prospect of an efficient women&apos;s group.During the. past fortnight there have been signs of activity among&apos;, small groups of Egyptians and Indians in the Metropolis, who appear to think the time ripe for agitation.   The Communists, are takin,. an interest in the matter and MacManus and Inkpin are frequent visitors at Saklatvala^ house:   it is worthy of note that, acting on the instructions of the Koraintern, MacManus has ajrproached&apos;Chaman Lai.   It is reported, on the authority of a single informant that Friis has business with. Indians in London.   There is evidence of communication between an Egyptian anarchist-communist in Alexandria and the Jewish &quot;Workers1 Friend&quot; group in L:nc&apos;oiioTHE/
commrmicate/TES YOUNG CQMMJNIST LEAGUEMoscdw&quot;a orders for the &quot;unification&quot; of the Communist Parties in Great Britain resulted in mufch dissonsion last year and a similar position has arisen in connection with the Young Communist League:   in oach case ths real cause of friction would appear to he that the &quot;rebels&quot; value their pay and importance as highly &apos; as the &quot;Cauae.&quot;   The following instructive complaint has been sent from Scotland to communist headquarters in &apos;.  London:&quot;As an outcome of the Proletarian School .    Movement applying for affiliation to the Communist Party,  they were invited to attend a unity conference with the Young Workers1 League, by Jas. Stewart acting on the instructions of Communist Party.     This conference, took place on August 20th till 26th and   &apos; resulted in the election of tho following Off ice-Bearers:- Jas. Stewart, General Secretary; Carrol and Lohr, Organisers; Gilbert, Chairman; Hilley, Editor and Manager of &apos;Young Communist&quot;,   Comrade &apos;   &quot;     A. Nott was appointed to act as representative on the Y.CI. at Berlin.    It was further decided to incorporate the &quot;Red Dawn1 and  1 Young Worker5 in the . new paper to be called the &apos;Young communist.&quot;These decisions when reported back,&apos;were ratified by the Prole tar ian E.C. * in Glasgow, who agreed to continue to act as Divisional Committee of the Young Communist Movement,- &quot;On. J^s. Stewart reporting the outcome of the conference (Birmingham) to the Oommunist Party the decisions Were considerably altered&apos;by some person or persons acting on behalf of tho adult movement. These alterations, be i t noted , were mad e without either consulting or obtaining consent of the late Proletarian School Ssecutive, now acting as Divisional Committee,  .&quot;The following were the alterations made: Carrol was appointed General Secretary; Nott, Chairman; Lohr, National Organiser and Jas* Stewart to be in charge and made responsible to tho Communist Party,     An office was allocated :at headquarters (CP,). Three or four of these were full time officials.   The financial arrangements were that 50$ of the expenses be borne by CP. and 50$ by &apos; TY.CI.1&quot;The old Proletarian E,C, insisted and still insists that&apos;the decisions as formulated at Birmingham conference be carried out,. -&quot;One of the decisions at the Birmingham  . conference - viz: that no individual was to
communicate with the Y.C.I. Headquarters in Berlin on his or her own  initiative, was violated by Comrade Carrol, who on his own responsibility sent a letter to Berlin asking headquarters to spur on the movement in this country as nothing was being done.   With the result that the committee &quot;at Berlin instructed an American Comrade to call at London,&apos; on his way home, to see what was holding things up; also to state that a comrade will arrive in London in a week or two will act as representative of the Y.0,1, in this country.&quot;The Constitution and Rules of the Young Communist League, as adopted at the Birmingham Conference have now been printed in pamphlet form:    the following extracts are not uninteresting:. &quot;ABES ^nd objects&quot;The abolition of W-ge-Slavery by the complete overthrow of Capitalism, and the setting up of a Communist Republic, of a Socially and Economically equal People...1.     &quot;The establishment of Sunday Schools for Children.

&quot;Division No, (3) London, and all Counties south of Division JJ0.S.11IHDUSTRI^L POLICY ffl TKu OJHJjTOjT H-.^RTYVAs stated in previous reports the BxeoutiveCommittee of the Communist Party has been considering -industrial policy:    the following quotations aro taken from a &quot;secret document embodying the finalrecommendations.Obligations, of Party members in works, factoryti mine s.Railroads and,.indtistrial undertaki^&quot;For the effective conduct of our propaganda a communist industrial nuclei or group embracing the party members therein should be established&quot; in every shop or works &amp;c.     Such communist nuclei must h$t assume that it is a werks committee in the real sense of the word.   Workshop, factory or pit committees embrace all or the majority of the workers in a given plant including non-party workers as well as party members...&quot;&quot;...Th3 main form of Communist activity in aSditien to the setting up of works committees is to assist the workers in their trade unions in their struggles asainst the employing-class to initiate common action for economic &quot;improvement and draw the sympathetic elements in the shop towards ccmmunist activity.   This may be dene by verbal propaganda amongst the backward workers by the distribution of all forms of party literature by meal hour talks aril the participation in every fcrm of organisation connected with workshops life. The co-ordination of all shop nuclei and works nuclei is secured through their connection with the local Communist branch or leading party committee as the responsible controlling body representing the ind us tri al d epartme nt of the &apos; party... .TiObligations of Party; Members, in, the Trade Union erg ana sat ions.&quot;...It is obligatory on all members of the CP. to join the Trade Union catering for their industry, participate in its daily activities, and aid in the   recruiting of the unorganised workers to the Unions.   Side by side with the daily revolutionary Communist work, the1 activities of part members in the;trade unions&apos; branch must take the direction of assuming responsible po si ti one.. The&apos; duty of tho Communist Is to take part in every potty struggle in every local activity, seeking by. assuming responsibility,, to fight down the opportunist and reformist elements and to wrest the leadership for Communism.   Ko opportunity should be lost/
lost to emphasise the revolutionary nature of the struggle confronting the workers.     Gomrunista working in their trade ,unions must endeavour to utilize every opportunity for discussion and soek to extract the maximum practical value out of every daily situation,     GorTmunists who are Trade Union officials must remember that their first? obligations are. to the Pirty, i.e,, tho party has first claim upon all its members.     The winning of official positions by party members can only be of value for communism when Pitrty members hold in;? such positions use them to the advantage of the party,,,&quot;Relation of Oommuiiists to Trade OounclIs.ff,To make the Trades Councils real fighting organs of the proletariat class struggle they must have some vital touch and contact with the working masses.   This can be best achieved by having direct representation from, the works committees, as well as from the T/&quot;-.\de Union Branch or district committees of the Unions.    T&quot;o structure of the Trades Councils must be enlarged for this purpose.     The Communists everywhere must seek to 3ain control of the Trades Councils end by ousting the reactionary leaders, transform these Councils into real councils of action,, ready to fight every issue that affects the workers and with power to c.11 the workers into action whenever necessary for the defence or advancing of working class interests.   Experience   teaches, however,that it is not enough to declare a strike. It is just as essential to be able &quot;bo maintain the strike when it is declared.   Contact with the local co-operative societies therefore provides a useful method of mainten^noa and direct representation&quot; from the co-operative societies in conjunction with the representatives of the workshop committees and trade union branches with powers to take direct action would&apos; transfer the Trades Councils from being mere hunting, grotmds for political careerists into real industrial fighting organs of the class struggle, capable of taking direct action and at the same tima ensuring maintenance during such struggles,&quot;The Communist nuclei in the workshops; in the trade union branch;    in the Trades Councils and in the Co-operatives should be co-ordinated through a f       local committee for the better organisation of their activities and the con duct, of their Communist propaganda. &quot;For the better representation and organic contact between localities nationally, the Trades Councils should hfjsre direct representation on the Trade Union Congress...&quot;SMl^SSJ: Organisations: Conferences and Trades Congress,*...To make the T.U.C. a. real Council of &quot;&apos; action, its structure must be enlarged.   It must be made up   efa) Direct nEnd&amp;tpries from tlie workshops on a given numerical basis.b) Direct mahdatorie s&apos; from the National Unions.
c) Direct mandatories from the Trades Cox/noils.d) Direct mandatories from the Co-operative Societies.From these mandatories a general council should he elected and from the council a small hut real general staff should he elected with deliberative and    lisciplinary powers to take direct action&apos;on matters of vital concern&apos;for the working class.     In all communist activities, our object must eyer he the acquisition of as much power as possible, the ability to lead the widest seotions of the masses in the communist direction and organise them for the final conquest of i^ower from the hands of, the present capitalist class...&quot;THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;Interesting light is thrown on the   criticalposition of the &quot;Daily Herald Ts&quot; finances by the followingletter which Norman Ewer, the foreign editor, has sentto Philips Price, marked &quot;strictly confidential&quot;.&quot;I got back to find that the situation has absolutely changed.   G.L, had put before the representatives of the First (trade union) Debenture Holders the whole position of the paper and had put it to them that there were only three possible alternatives - l) to kill the paper, 2) to ask the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress to assume finanoial responsibility, and, therefore, control, 3) to make another big effort to raise from the unions enough money to enable us &quot;bo go back to a penny immediately, and to give.us a reasonable prospect of being able to stand the loss involved over the period of time necessary to rebuild circulation to the point at which we should again be a \aying concern.&quot;Not a single voice was raised in favour of tho third course - the speakers were unanimously for handing over to the Labour Party and T.U.G.   Moreover, it had become obvious that the failure of our appeal ,  to the unions is in itself significant.    It moans that, probably owing to certain influences that have bben busily at-work, we shall not get any more appreciable financial backing from them so long as we remain an unofficial paper..&quot;G..1. saw only two courses open.   One was to accept&apos;the money which you so generoiisly offered and&apos; to try, on the basis of that   and what we had raised, a sporting effort to go to a penny and survive:   with the certainty that failure meant inevitable death. The other was to bow- to the expressed wish of the . -   . debenture holders and offer the paper to the official movement on condition that it accepts the v-hole financial responsibility.&quot;You can guess that it was-not an easy decision to take, but, after weighing the whole thing up, George felt that the step was inevitable, anddefinitely/
definitely made the offer.    It has not yet been accepted - a committee of investigation is going into the accounts and things; but at any minute now we may learn that the two bodies have decided to accept the offer.   In that case, the transfer will be immediately made,&quot;You can imagine how heartbroken we all feel with the prospect of becoming official and passing under the control of Eccleston   Square.   It is a terrible thing to have built up tho paper and then to have to hand it over to men in whom none of us have really any   confidence, and between whose views and ours there are large and unbridgeable gulfs.    All of us, of course, have the feeling that we would like to get up and walk out of the office and let them do what they like with the paper, but, however satisfying that would bo to our personal feelings, we all agree that it is our duty to the movement to stay on as long as we honourably and efficiently can.   Neither in the office nor among others we may have consulted is there any doubt that this is our right course.   We therefore stay here and make an effort to carry on the paper on the same lines as we have carried it on in the past two-and-a-half years.   Ho** strong the pressure will be to make us alter that line we cannot yet foresee. That there will be pressure is certain.    That we shall have to yield to a certain extent is equally certain. But a point will come sooner or later - and perhaps rather sooner than later - at which the position will be intolerable end we shall have to walk out.   We are already beginning to discuss what is to be done if and when that step is thrust upon us.&quot;Now, of   your own position.     Of course, as regards the money you offered, it would be out of the question now &quot;to&apos; accept it.   ProbaMy, if you could still keep the offer open, we shall need it later on when the break comes.   Apart from that, 1 tako it that you will stand in with us and remain at your post so long as it is possible.   Having regard to everything, I think that it is quite conceivable that the struggle, when it does arise, will quite probably come over either you or Euh,     Neither of you is particularly popular in official circles, and there is sure to be a strong desire to give a Second . International tinge to our whole foreign policy. That desire might express itself in demands that will come directly on me here or i t may express itself either in demands on you. or in an actual demand for the removal of one or both of you. It it should come in that last form, I should of course stand absolutely by you, and your going will involve my going, and so provoke the whole internal crisis.   When they realise that, it may, of cotTrse. make them more cautious, but we cannot bank on thai,&quot;This being the position, I sm sure that I can count on you to work in with the rest of us and to do everything that is possible to carry out the, agreed plan of doing everything in our power to keep the HERALD, as. long as we oan do so, in our own actual oontrol, and to keep it, if not aLeft/
loft-wing, at any rate a Left-centre organ,&quot;You will &quot;be feeling, as wo all are., utterlymiserable about it; but it is no good worrying,   V7o h*v*sggot. to keep our Leads and do the best we can in as &apos;damnable a situation as ever mon were forced into,&quot;This letter was dated December 16th and on December 2GthEwer applied for a passport &quot;to go to Moscow to. makaarrangomonts in connection with the &quot;Daily Herald&apos; RussianNews So it ice&quot;:   he intondod to go via Berlin and ha3 made arrangements to meot Philips Price in that city.   Fromsubsequent, information it seems possible that   Ewer, Price,Euh (the Vienna corespondent) and other extremists may leavetho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; if it is taken over by the Labour party and thora are reasons for the supposition that EworTs journejto Russia is not concerned merely with the News Service ofthe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; but has as one of its objects thediscussion of financial support from Russia for the group which at present runs the paper: it will be remembered furthsthat Philips Price is a man of considerable, means.   Accordingto a recent admission in 123e &quot;Daily Herald&quot;&apos; the &quot;Back to a penny&quot; c-mpaign has brought in only about  8,000 whereas itslosses are reported to be about  600 weekly in spite of thepresent price,   The prospects that the existing managementoan make the paper pay by halving its selling price aretherefore not bright-.&quot;THE WORKER&quot;There is documentary evidence that. &quot;The Worker&quot; is in : financial difficulties:   over  600 are owing to the printers who-were asked to produce two issues during the holidays and received  6 on account:   tbey declined to deliver the seoond &apos; issue. &apos;The paper maintains its revolutionary tone and in the \current issue J.R. Campbell writes:&apos; &apos;   &quot;In&apos; some places already the unemployed have made raids on factories which are working systematic overt 1* That is a good tactic, but it will have to be developed upon a national scale if it is to have decisive effect. The struggle to prevent the extension of the workingSay/
day is the next ph?.se of the tin employed struggle, and the organisations should be prepared for th* t purpose now.     Those unemployed who are still members of trade unions should he enoouraged to go to their branches and raise the question advocating that the varioiis union executives, instead of waiting to be defeated in detail, should come together and endeavour to create a common front between the employed and unemployed.   District meetings of all the trade union branches in an area should be summoned and the policy discussed.   The district committees cf the various unions should be forced together, and in conjunction with tho unemployed should develop local machinery capable of controlling any local movements that may take place.   When the first heavy attack is made by the employers on any one industry tho workers in all industries and the unemployed must be prepared to line up at once.&quot;ARRESTS AND convictions on December  2nd William Ray of the Cazobeiwell Unemployed was fined  5 at Lambeth Police Court for being drunk and disorderly and assaulting a police sergeant after an unemployed meeting;   he endeavoured to evade arrest snQ a labourer named Arthur Gutteridge who attempted to rescue him was fined 40/-.On December 30th Ernest Johannaon and Olaf Neilsson were charged at South Shields Police Court with landing in the United Kingdom without the  -emission of the Immigration Officer and with failing to notify their presence to the Registration Officer:     each was sentenced to three months1 imprisonment and recommended for deportation.
