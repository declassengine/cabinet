QGyilCj..........    rU M *Vx* ... j   . .- V7 Vfy;.... . v-.......is the 0Translation.November 17th,1921.O.P.-. 3 50 1   )J1&quot;&quot;&apos;-......&quot;My Lord Marquess,Following on the conversation which Your Lordship held, with M. de St. Aulaire in regard to the agreement reached &quot;between M. Franklin Bouillon and the Government of Angora, Your Lordship was good enough to address, on the 5th instant, to the Ambassador of the &quot;t500    Republic, a letter drawing attention to the various points on which the Agreement in question seems to the British Government to go beyond an arrangement of a purely local character (&quot;tractation locale&quot;) as defined by Ma Briand, and to reserve special and particular advantages for France.I hastened to -bring this letter to the notice of my Government, which, having examined it with the greatest care and in the most friendly spirit, has requested me to communicate to Your Lordship the observations which its consideration has suggested.. The French Government has no doubt but that the clear and precise character of this explanation will remove the impression which would appear, from Your Lordshiprs letter, to have been formed, and which can only be duo to a&apos;misunderstanding.In the first place, the French Government is glad to see that His lie majesty&apos;s Government have clearly understood the nature of the two missions with which M. Franklin Bouillon was entrusted, missions of which Your Lordship was informed from the moment when they were first decided on.M. Franklin
M. Franklin Bouillonrs first journey was under-taken on his own suggestion and in an entirely private and personal capacity; the French Government gladly availed itself of this opportunity to obtain information in regard to the policy of the Angora Government and the possibilities of putting an end to the hostilities, of which France was bearing the whole brunt in cilicia, at a moment when the nation and the Chamber had vigorously expressed their determination to put an end to cruel bloodshed and to expenditure which it was particularly diffioult to bear.The President of the Council considered that M. Franklin Bouillon was fully qualified to undertake such an enquiry, in view of the fact that he was a former member of the Government, in view of his deep knowledge of eastern affairs, and of the guarantees offered by his experience and activity.Your lordship will recognise that there was nothing inthis programme of enquiry, to which I have just referred, which was contrary to the assurances given by M. Briand, to the effect that Prance neither had contracted nor would contract an engagement in regard to the general questions of peace between the Allies and Turkey, without being in close agreement with the former, and particularly with the British Government.As regards Li. Franklin Bouillonrs second mission, of the official character of which Your Lordship was informed, that mission fell no less within the scope indicated by M. Briand than the first.   Leaving wholly on one side the problems of a general peace, it was strictly limited to the negotiations? of those questions referred to by Your Lordship yourself in your letter of November 5th, that is, the liberation of Prcnch prisoners, the protection of minorities in Cilicia, and - questions which arose as mecessary corollaries of the evacuation of Cilicia by our troops.The .......
The 3Prenoh Government has instructed me to renew the assurance that it has always reserved the question of peace with Turkey, and that it has never, contemplated that any engagement could he entered into on this subject excepting in close agreement with its allios and particularly with the British Government. Categorical assurances on this point have already been given to the British Government on the 14th July, 1921, and I have boon directed categorically to ropoat them.The French Government repeats these assuranoes all the more willingly sinoe it has found in the British Government the same spirit of complete co-operation ir. during the conversations which have recently takon placo in London between Your lordship and the Greek ministers with a view to reach a satisfactory settle-men t in tho Near East.     The Government of the Republic cannot but express its satisfaction in recognising the absolute identity of principles&apos; whioh is thus shown to exist between the two Govern-ments.This full agreement on the principles whioh govern tho conduct of the two Governments renders it all the easier for the French Government to dissipate all misunderstanding, both in regard to the scope of the Angora Agreement and in regard to the motives which have led France to approve it.It is truo that the British Government have drawn tho attention of the French Government to the disad-vantages to a direct agreement betwoon France and the Government of Angora.    On the 4th A-ril in the course of a visit of the British Ambassador to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Lord Hardinge was reminded that in March 1921, M. Briand had declared on several occasions to Mr. Lloyd george, without the british prime/
Prime Minister making the slightest   observation, that ho would not leave England without having concluded an agreement with the. Angora-delegation.     M, Briand had pointed out that neither the Chamber...nor French public opinion would agroo to the prolongation of hostilities, involving as they did losses which wore both heavy and useless, since the Treaty rf Sevros sanctions the ovaouation of cilicia, and since the slight concessions made in regard to the northern frontier of tho Syrian mandate, in accordance with that principle of nationality which has dominated tho whole peace settlement, are not -to the disadvantage of any of the Allies, while, at the same time, being of a nature calculated to facilitate a general settlomont.     It was at the same time cloaa-ly explained to Lord Hirdinge that M, Briand had also stated to Mr. Lloyd Georgo that he would only sign such an agroemont at the last moment and after it had been proved impossible to reach a general settlement of tho Eastern question in London.    It was in the course of this interview that, as early as the 4th April last, the British Ambassador received the text of the agreoment in question.Those declarations were renowed to Your Lordship by Mi do St. Aulaire on 19th A^ril last, whon you wore so good as to discuss this question with tho representative of the Republic.     The French Government was justified in&apos; believing that tho explanation given by the French Ambassador had reassurod tho British Government, since Your Lordship went no further with the despatch of the note which you had informed M. de St. Aulaire you would send him on this subject.Since that date, indoed, the French Government has continually announced, particularly in its letter ofthe/
the 14th July last to the British Ambassador in Paris, its desire to put an end to the hostilities which were being carried on on the borders of the Syrian mandate, as soon as it could obtain the acceptance of definite provisions assuring the protection of the minorities and especially of the Armenians,It was in these circumstances, and at a time when the Allies had long withdrawn their troops from the various points of the Ottoman Empire, the military occu-pation of which had taken place as a consequence of the armistice, that the French Government considered, after having informed its allies of its intentions, and while carefully reserving the solution of all the general questions which must be decided jointly by the Allies, that it had the right to embark on a course which its partners had already followed, and in making use of such means as events forced upon it *   His Majesty1s Government will in fact recognise that, if the withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s Forces from the frontiers of Mesopotamia and the removal of Allied military control over the Anatolian railways was able to be carried out without any agreement with the Government of Angora, v^hich at that time had no power of attack, a similar course could not be pur-sued on the frontiers of Syria, for, on the one hand, the Nationalist forces have since then considerably developed and on the other, Syria is not, like Mesopotamia,, protected by distance.No/
TSt ono caB doubt that Prance enly had a choioo botween the two following alternatives;^-Either to maintain her effectives -md to continue the war in Galicia, orto negotiate with the de facto authority which was in command of the Turkish troops in this region.The will of the French nation manifopting itself cloarly strongly ami constantly in favour of svacua-tion, the French Government was obliged to attempt the conclusion of a local arrangement which, more-ovor, conforms in its fundamental provisions, with tho arrangement of which the text was communicated to the British Government on 4 April 1921.Having thus described in detail the general tendencies which prompted the action taken by the French Government, I have the honour to give Your Lordship the. following explanations regarding par* ticular point? pentioned in&apos;Your-Lord ship&apos;s letter of 2Tov 3iiber 5th.The word-i &quot;cessation of the &apos; state of war&quot; which appear in Article 1, so em to His Lp.jesty&apos;s Government to be unsuitable terras in which to define a local armistice.   Your Lordship considers, furthermore, that the provisional chs riic ter &quot;of the arrahgenent arrived at should have be?n mentioned, whereas the terras  ictually used,- on the contrary, -give the agreement the appearance of a regular treaty of ;ooi.cg,As/
As tho director of political affairs has already-pointed out verbally to Lord Hardingo, the Angora Agreo-raont does not constitute a treaty of peace.     It is only an arrangement of local significance concluded with a Power which is neithor recognisod de jure nor do fao to, hut which has manifested a degree of authority, patriotism and loyalty, such as to warrant the opinion that it is capable of keeping and executing the obliga-tions which it has assumed.     Generally speaking, if the Angora Agreement had constituted a treaty of peace, it should, according to the constitution, have been submittod to Parliament for ratification.     As it is, it has simply been approved by the Fronch Government and no Parliamentary ratification has been asked for.The French Government, on tho other hand, considers that tho use of expressions &quot;armistice and provisional arrangement&quot; would have involved the risk of alarming the populations by making thorn fear a resumption of hostilities.As regards the term &quot;high contracting parties&quot; its value is only one of usage and traditional courtesy, Moreover, it already figures in the London Agreement, and the British Government have hithorto raised no objection to it-     It is scarcely necessary to add t that the use of these expressions by no means implies, in international law, tho do jure recognition of a new state or government.The British Government consider that article 3 of the Angora arrangement does not take into/
(e)into account the obligations.assumed by France under article 8 of the Tripartite Agreement.   According to the interpretation which Your Lordship puts upon article 8, Franco ha9 undertaken not to withdraw, her troops from her zone of special interest? until after she is assured of the execution of the guarantees for the safety of the minorities.The French Government considers that article 8 of the Tripartite Agreement of 18 August 1920 was drawn up, not with the object of obliging us to remain in Cilicia, but on the contrary with the intention of limiting our occupation.    It stands to reason that the French Government would never have consented to undertake an indefinite occupation and to bear its cost.The French Government has moreover on various occasions as I have pointed out above drawn the attention of the British Government to the fact that it was obliged to put an end to the abnormal situation which was being prolonged by the hostilities- en the Syrian frontier, at a time when hostilities had ceased between the other Allies and Turkey without rendering it possible to consider that a state of peace had thereby bean e stablished.Furthermore, the French Government desires to make ,i general observation   as to the validity of the Tripartite Agreement upon which the juridical arguments in Your Lordship&apos;s letter of the 5th, November are- principally founded.The/
The French Government would in no case con-sider itself authorised to enter into any compromise regarding the rights accorded &quot;by this Agreement to either of hor Allies. Great Britain or Italy,but it considers that it has all the more reason to renounce the advantage s accorded to it, because this Agreement ha-i not been ratified, and because the Treaty of Sevres must, as has been stated quite recently by Lord Curzon to the Greek Minister-s in London, undergo certain modificationsc    It cannot, then, be considered as having the force of an operative treaty,,Again, in the Turkish territory, both within and outside tho zones from -rhich Allied troop3 have been withdrawn, it had not bean possible hitherto to obtain any guarantee in favour of minorities,, France, on tho contrary, has expressly made any eventual withdrawal of her troops from Cilicia subject to the engagement entered into by the Angora Government that it will assure the protection of minorities, and to the effective adoption of the necessary measure&apos;.),His Kajesty&apos;s Government regret that hy article 6France should have admitted, for the protection of the minorities, guarantees which differ from those which theTreaty of Sevres provided,  ind that by failing to limitthese provisions specially to Cilicia, the Freich.appearedGovernment&apos; should have /to meet one of the claims of the Angora Government in a matter of great importance and of general bearing, whereas ^ matter of this kind should,    by its nature, form the subject of an inter-allied agreement and be re-served for negotiations as to a general peace,France/
Fiance cannot, without injustice, he reproached with having failed to sooure the acceptance of the guarantees for the protection of the Cilician minorities, which the pressure of the aggregate strength of the Allies has. been unable to exact from Turkey.    The withdrawal of Fxonch troops being a necessity, the Government of the Eg .ublic considered that its dosiro not to depart from the terms of the signed, but unratified, Treaty of Sevres could not be pushed to tho point of leaving the minorities without any protection, and that an obligation of humanity obliged it to secure for the minorities at least tho guarantees contained in the^ treaties which have been imposed by the Eaton to upon Hv. vcary and Bulgaria.As regards Your lordship1!-: rogret&apos; that these latter guarantees might be considered as applying not only to Cilicia, but to othor parts of Turkey also, the French Government considers that the entire A:gora Agreement is dominated by tho idea that it is only a question of an arrangement of local importance.Furthermore, no reproach should be made to tho French Government on tho ground \.hat it has extended its obligations, not in its own interests, but in tho interests of tho Anatolian populations, who, at the moment, are still deprived of every kind of protection.Over and above tho guarantees formally specified-in the Agreement, I may add that M, Franklin Bouillon agreed with tho Angora Government that he should himself : supervise the conditions of the evacuation of the territory and of tho establishment of tho now - authorities. In this duty ho will bo assisted; by three special delegates, of tho: Fronch Gpyerm&amp;ejat^ who w,ill re.si.de at Adana, Mersina and Aintab.
The administrative system for the district of Alexandretta contemplated in- Article 7 does not conflict with the system contemplated for the Uandate which is to take into account the extreme diversity of races in Syria. It harmonises with the general organisation of countries under French mandate, and this organisation already allows a large measure of administrative autonomy to the different racial elements.     Article 7 of the Angora agreement moreover does not confer on Turkey any political or economic right and only contemplates the use of Turkish concurrently -&apos;&apos;ith Arabic and French because the&apos;great majority of the population speak Turkish.The frontier rectification contemplated in Article 8 appears to Your Lordship to affect not only the French Government but also the Allied Governments, since the territories taken from Turkey constitute the gage of the common victory.     Your Lordship considers that the territorial modification of the Syrian mandate does not take into account the obligations of France towards the League of nations, while the retrocession, without previous notice bein^ given to Great 3ritain and Italy, of the territories which Turkey had abandoned to the. Allies, is incompatible with both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty which bears the signature of the three Powers.   This situation appears to Your Lordship to be all the more re-grettable because, as the frontier is to be fixed within a month of the signature of the agreement, the Turco-Syrian frontier will be decided before all the other Turkish frontiers, which are to be delimited by the Treaty of Sevres.&apos;    The
The French Government must first point out that upon the morrow of the Armistice the Allies effected other occupations and took measures of military control in Turkey, which equally constituted gages of importance, and yet it has been impossible to maintain in their integrity either these occupations or these measures of control.The districts under the Syrian mandate dealt with in Article 8 are, moreover, not properly Arab territory but rather a country of migrations without precise limits, without sedentary population, and where not Arabs but Kurds predominate.Finally there would appear to be some exaggeration in reproaching France with giving up a relatively insig-significant fraction of the occupied Turkish territory at a time when more than three years after the Armistice she is still bearing the losses and the cost of maintenance of an army of nearly 100,000 men on the frontiers of Syria, while in the other parts of Turkey where Allied troops were stationed, effectives have been progressively reduced to a fewbattalions.     The maintenance of such numerous con-contingents has been the result hitherto not of the diffi-culties of keeping order in Syria, but rather of the necessity of being in a position to face an eventual Turkish threat against Cilicia.     The end of this danger will enable the French Government no doubt, in a very short time, to make a considerable reduction in the French forces in the east.It is well to add that our Allies have for a long time been aware of the obligation under which we were to abandon certain portions of the Syrian mandated territory in order to secure the evacuation of Cilicia.As regards the territories lying between the Euphratesand
(la).and the Tigris which, practically speaking ha* never been occupied by the Allied foroes, the communication made to Lord Hardinge on April 4th of the agreement, concluded at London between Monsieur Briand and Bekir Sami at any rate amounted to a precise indication of the intention of the French Government to give up the occupation of these territories,,With regard to the reproach that we have given up this territory as the result of an agreement, it ia right to repeat that the present situation is very different from that of which the Powers might have previously profitted. The Turkish forces have developed considerably.   The Angora Government now pos-sesses armies of an offensive value which it had not previously.   As soon as the evacuation of Cilicia was decided upon it became impossible to avoid the necessity for making an agreements and it would have been inconceivable that such an agreement should be arrived at without certain concessions on both sides. The preach Government is convinced that in this respect it has given the League of Nations no ground for complaint.Moreover, the argument about mandates can for many reasons not be maintained,.    The mandates have not yet been ratified by the League of Nations and their terms are still under discussion.    The Treaty of Sevres has not. come into force.    The British Government even admit that it must be modified0   The frontiers which it nas fixed are therefore not unalterable,,   France, the mandatory for Syria, is alone entitled to deal with the interests of the Syrian popu-lation in their unavoidable relations with the Turkish population beyond the frontier.The regret expressed by Your Lordship regarding Article 9 which deals with the tomb of Sultan Suleiman appears to be based upon an interpretation which the French Government desires to correct,,
correct.    The matter at issuo is not a question of sovereignty hut rather a right of property which has been reoognisod for sentimental reasons.Article 10 merely establishes the fact that the Angora Government accepts tho transfer of tho concession of tho Bozanti-Kisibin section of tho Baghdad Railway to a Fronch group, and does not state, as does Article 294 of the Treaty of Sevres, that tho Government &quot;will transfer&quot; the said con-cession.     Thus the procedure contemplated by Article 294 of the Treaty of Sevres is reserved and the Angora agreement constitutes no obstacle to its application.As regards the basis of the arrangoment made between the Allies regarding railways under Article 4 of the Tri-partite agreement and particularly paragraph 2 of that Articlo, the British Government will bo so good as to note that the French Government desires to confirm the fact that this arrangement is in no sense modified, nor is the distribution between France, Great Britain and Italy of the whole Baghdad Railway.The Treaty of Sovros provided for the disposal of the Baghdad Railway up to tho River Jeihun only.    If this Treaty had como into force, the Railway east of the Joihun would have been in tho heart of Syria, and, in view of this, it would havo had to be liquidated, in accordance with the Troaty of Sevres, by Hie mandatory power acting alone.    The transfer of this section to a French Company, in accordance with tho Angora agreement, loaves our position unaltered, while leaving the railway in Turkish territory.    It is true that this argument cannot bo applied to the section of tho lino which runs between the Cilician Gates and the Jeihun.    There would therefore appear to be a certain justification for the protest against an immediate transfer to a French company of/
of this section which, according to the terms of the Tripartite agreement, was to ho exploited jointly as an Anglo Franco-Italian undertaking,   But in reality paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the Tripartite agreement expressly contemplate3 the transfer to us of this section as representing the French interests which existed in the Baghdad railway before 1914,     Thus Article 10 of the Angora agreement, far from leing a violation of the provisions of the Tripartite agreement, does not in reailty amount to more than application of them in advance.As regards the use of the lino for military purposes, its principal object Is the maintenance of order in the districts far removed from all means of communication; but it &quot;&quot;ould be inconceivable that the a\ail&quot;;ray could be used against Great Britain,    The railway in fact pasnes over Syrian mandated territory from kaidan Skbez as far as Choban Beg, and the French Government would therefore be in a position to put a. stop to any transport which might seem to imply the possibility of -v military threat against the frontier of Kesopotamia.On this point, the French Government is anxious to give to His Majesty1 s Government the most formal assurance that, it could in no case contemplate the posJibility of any sort of facilities being given by it to hqstilo designs directed against any. territory under a British mandate. The close ties ^hich unite France and the British Empire, and the French Government&apos;s conception of its duties, both as a member of tho League of Nations and a,s a mandatory power, are sufficient to dispel any such fears0
In tho event of an armed confliot,    the laws of neutrality would in fact impose on tho French Government tho obligation &quot;to prohibit the uso of Syrian territory by Turkish transport, and the railway beyond Choban Bog,   cut off from the rest of turkey, would lose all practical value.The letter from Yussouf Kemal which accompanied the text of the agreoment has also formed the subject of comment on the part of the British Government.     Your Lordship has expressed rogret that this letter would appear to establish a connection between promises of concessions and the wish, expressed in the same) letter, that in viow of the ancient relations oxisting between tho two &quot;nations&quot;, questions relating to tho independence and sovereignty of Turkey should be oxamined by France in a friendly spirit.The government of tho Republic desires to givo tho assurance that it soeks in Turkey no exclusive advant-ages either political or economic.     It has not departed in this matter in tho slightest degree from the general principles of the Treaty of.Sevres and of the Tripartite agreement.     It has taken tho greatest.care to reserve all questions relating to peace with Turkey, which is and must remain an interallied matter.     The promises of concessions indicated in Youssouf Kemal&apos;s letter are not connected with any secret engagement, either written or verbal, entered into by Mr. Franklin Bouillon, in regard to the questions which must be decided by agreement between the allies and particularly in regard to tho Turkish claims to Smyrna and Thrace.     Mr. Franklin Bouillon indeed has neither discussed nor would have agreed to discuss any territorial questions other than those involved in the evacuation of Cilicia.The/
Tho Turkish negotiator at Angora has himself so clearly understood this situation, that it is stated in a speoial minuto that questions of a general nature are reserved to bo discussed when peaoe is made.   Thus he specifically re-served, until the oonolusion of tho Treaty of Peace, any settlement of the questions oonneotod with the participation of Syria in the Ottoman debt, with the liquidation of property of the State, of the Crown and of the Evkaf, with the oapitu-latory regimo, or with any other matters,following on tho change of soveroignty in the mandated territories.   If he expressed a desire to tho French negotiator he was oareful to limit himself to begging him to reoommond hia request to the consideration of tho French Government at euoh times as the Treaty of peaoo may bo negotiated.Your Lordship has expressed the desire-to know whether the French Government had replied or proposed to reply to&quot; Yussouf Kemal,   Mr, Franklin Bouillon confined himself to addressing to Yuasouf Komal an acknowledgement of the receipt of his communication in the terms of the first paragraph adding his thanks for the sentiments and wishes expressed by the Angora Minister,As to the reports regarding on the one hand, a promise made to Franoe of a monopoly over the organisation of the gendarmerie, and on tho other the possibility of a loan, or again the supply of war material, they are devoid of all foundation.   The exchanges of views, whether verbal or written, which may have taken plaoo between certain political personages and Mr, Franilin Bouillon, add nothing to the substance of the agreoment, which carries with it no 3ecrot arrangement.   It is, in fact, not without painful surprise that the French Govern-ment has seen mention in an official document, ..oven though it was added that no credence was attached to them, of rumours of encouragement alleged to have been given by France to anti-British agitation in Mesopotamia, The ^relations between Franceand Great Britain are too olose and too friendly for   -it to be necessary to deny such imputation.If/
If, putting aside the purely legal aspect of this question the two governments look at the matter from a higher point of view, Your Lordship will recognize on the one hand, that the French Government could not prolong indefinitely the aaorificea of every kind which the occupation of Cilicia involved, at a time when the allied forces had withdrawn from numerous distric seized as guarantees at the time of the Armistice, and, on the other hand,  that the intentions of the French Government in this matter had been clearly and frequently declared by France, both through her Prime Minister and through her diplomatic representatives.   Without claiming in any sense to have assured herself of SnglandTs agreement to her plans, France can legitimately maintain that she warned her Ally of the necessities which she had to take into account-In these circumstances I have no doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not adhere to the objections which they raised at first sight to the Angora agreement, but will recognize that France has done everything in her power to reconcile the maintenance of her legal obligations, the care of the interests of her Allies, and her duties from the humanitarian point of view, with the necessity with which the Government of the Republic was faced of freeing itself from a burden which public opinion regarded as insupportable.The French Government, however, is not unwilling to admit that when peace is concluded,  the different agreements which have been negotiated hitherto  (Treaty of Sevres, Tripartite Agreement, arrangements for the liberation of prisoners, and . the Angora Agreement),  shall be adjusted in such a way as to take their place in the general settlement,I avail myself, &amp;c, &amp;cf
