This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3jQSECEET. 5CP. 3585,THE CABINET.financial questions outstanding  between   the war office and the india office.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.XOn 1st June last, the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of State for India., relating to the re-equipment of the Indian Army, on sjaecial financial terms, and one by myself proposing that this, with all other disputed claims between the India Office and the War Office arising out of the war, should form the subject of a special general settlement.The Cabinet postponed the question pending conference between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies as necessary.   (Cabinet, 46 (21), 1st June, 1921.)I have conferred with Mr. Montagu and proposed that the following six subjects : 1. Further contribution by India towards the cost of the war and division of war pension charges (Baldwin Committee) ; (25,000,000Z.*)2. East and South Persian expenditure, 1919-21 (Harris Committee Meshed); (6,000,000/.*)3. Prices to be paid by India for equipment in the hands of the Disposal Board ; 4. Leave, &amp;c, of Indian troops on demobilization ;5. Proposed transfer of Aden to the Imperial Government. Possible claims by India to recover war expenditure borne by Indian revenues ;6. Terms on which the War Office should replace field artillery equipment lent from Indian stocks during the war ;with any other claims or counter-claims on either side arising out of the war, should be brought into a general settlement in the nature of an arbitration binding on both sides. Mr. Montagu agreed in principle and promised to consult the Council of India.   At his invitation, I discussed the matter with that Council on 28th July.The subsequent history and present position of the matter are best shown by the following letters : Mr. Montagu to Sir L. Worthington-Evans, dated 18th August, 1921.&quot;My Council and I are much obliged to you for your visit on 28th July to discuss with them a mode of settlement of the outstanding questions between our two departments.Before you left the meeting, the Members of Council had expressed the wish to consider further the particular case of the expenditure in East&quot; Persia, and they have now done so. As a result, I am in a position&apos;to say that if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to drop their claim against this Office in respect of the casualty pensions of the British troops employed in the war, and to accept the interpretation placed by this Office on the offer made by the Viceroy&apos;s Legislative Council in September. 1918,1&quot; my Council are willing (1.) To submit to an arbitrator of high judicial position Questions 4 and 6 on your list, provided that the latter question has not been previously settled departmentally, and to accept the arbitrators decision. The questions i refer to are : No. 4. Incidence of leave and gratuity concessions granted to Indian soldiers on demobilization.No. 6. Terms on which the War Office should replace Field Artillery equipments lent from Indian stocks during the war.* These are the total sums in dispute. No figures are available for the amounts involved in items 3 to 6.t Please see Item 1 of your list of disputed questions aud Sections A and b of the Report of the Baldwin Committee.(B21/388)   100   12/21   HcScS, Ltd.   9613wo
(2.) As regards Question No. 2 by which we understand that of the incidence- of the cost of General Malleson&apos;s Mission and of the other troops in East Persia between 16th April, 1919, and the date of completion ,of the with-drawal of the Mission to leave it to an arbitrator of high judicial position to decide, with reference to the offer made to the Treasury in Sir A. Hirtzefs letter of 9th January, 1920, M. 29865, copy enclosed, how much of the expenditure between the dates referred to above was military and how much non-military, subject to the understanding that the offer in the letter of 9th January, 1920, is accepted as the basis of settlement and that the cost of the pay, allowances, provisions, transport and other expenses of the troops must be treated as military. My Council would on these conditions be prepared to accept the decision of the arbitrator.&quot;Sir A. THrtzeVs letter.No. M. 29865. India Office,London, S.W. 1.Sir, 9th January, 1920.With reference to Sir George Barstow&apos;s letter of the 25th November, No. 49012, i am directed to refer to the note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the incidence of cost of General Mallesons Military Mission now at Meshed, semi-officially forwarded by Mr. Bewley on 12th November, and to say that the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to accept generally the conclusion arrived at in paragraph 8 of the Chancellors note, and that he assumes that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree to the following statement of the resultant disposal of the cost of this Mission : 1. Expenditure on the Mission up to the date of the withdrawal to Meshed to be a military charge debitable to Imperial revenues (subject of course to a contribution from Indian revenues of the normal cost of officers and men of the Indian Establishment employed in the Mission).2. As regards the date to be taken as that of withdrawal to Meshed, the facts are : (a.) The Mission has always been at Meshed, though General Malleson and his officers visited Transcaspia where most of his troops were.(6.) The last of these troops crossed the border into Persia on 6th April. 1919, though all of them did not return to Meshed, and some still are on the frontier.(c.) From mid-day of 16th April, 1919, the force under General Malleson was transferred from the command of the General Officer Commanding,-Constantinople, to that of the Commander-in-chief, India. From these facts two possible dates emerge, viz. : 6th and 16 th April, 1919, and -Mr. Montagu suggests that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury should accept the 16th April, 1919, as the more suitable date.(3.) From the 16th April, 1919, subsequent non-military expenditure would accordingly be divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues on the half-and-half principle, subject to the proviso that purely military charges after the 16th April, 1919, should, as before, be dealt with by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury as agreed to in their letters of 21st August, 1916, No. 19988, and 27th March, 1919, No. 13060.I am, &amp;c.The Secretary, (Signed)   A. HIRTZEL.The Treasury.Sir L. Worthington-Evans to Mr. Montagu, dated 13th September, 1921.&quot;I have to reply to your letter of 18th August, about the mode of settlement of outstanding questions between our two departments arising out of the war.&quot; You will remember that the procedure to which you and I agreed in principle at our meeting at the House of Commons on 4th July last was that all these claims on either side &apos; should be brought into a general settlement in the nature of an arbitration binding on both sides.&apos;&quot; What you now offer me is something very different. You ask me to drop the big pensions claim, to say nothing more about India&apos;s &apos; further contribution,&apos; and to waive
I must strongly urge the necessity of settling the procedure for deciding these matters without further delay. In the present financial position we cannot leave such large possible charges and credits unsettled while leisurely controversy on questions of constitutional theory proceeds between Whitehall and Delhi.L. W.-E.The Wae Office,29th December, 1921.\altogether any question of 1&apos;ndia&apos;s liability for military expenditure in East Persia. If I will give way on these big claims, you will not give way on the smaller ones, but you will agree to refer these to arbitration. I have consulted the Treasury (who, as you know, are intimately concerned), and i regret that I am unable to accept this proposal.&quot; 1 venture to think that it is not reasonable for your Council to refuse to submit to arbitration questions in dispute between India and Great Britain. If two independent States fail to come to terms about claims on. one side or the other, they can either submit them to arbitration or, in the last resort, refuse to pay, and perhaps break off diplomatic relations or go to war. In the case of states within the British Empire, the latter course is happily not open to us, and it is not conceivable that any State should adopt a corresponding attitude. Surely it is our duty either to come to an agreement or, failing that, to agree to accept outside arbitration, and I cannot see that your Council is in any way abrogating the duties laid upon it by Statute if it frankly rocognizes that we have come to an impasse, and consents to accept the verdict of an impartial tribunal. That it is in the power of your Council to resist I fully admit; but I submit that equally it has the power to co-operate in seeking a judicial settlement of the questions between us.&quot; I trust, therefore, that on further consideration you will consent to refer to some form of arbitration all outstanding questions, and not reserve some for a non posswnus attitude.&quot;Mr. Montagu to Sir L. Worthington-Evans, dated 24th November, 1921.:&apos; I am very sorry I have not hitherto replied to your letter of 13th September, in regard to the settlement of outstanding questions between the War and India Offices arising out of the war.&quot; The matter has entailed a great deal of discussion here, and I fear that on further examination I have found it necessary to consult the Government of India before replying to your letter.&quot;
