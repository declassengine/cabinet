[8 DOCUr^IrT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC IviA JESTY&apos; S GOVERNM&amp;riT,CABINET. N.H.I.7.JJ553.Q.GOV.ahNi.iEKT OF IRELAND ACT, 1920. National. Health. Insurance in Ireland. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I desire to bring to the notice of ray colleagues the accompanying copy of a letter received by me from Sir Alfred Watson, Chairman of the Committee appointed to consider the steps necessary to carry out the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in respect of National Health Insurance.The appointed day for the .transfer to the Government of Northern Ireland of National Health Insurance has been fixed by Order in Council for 1st January.     Sir Alfred Wats onJs Committee, after an exhaustive examination of the subject, have come to the conclusion that it would be extremely difficult in the short time that remains before January 1st for the necessary administrative arrangements in connection with the transfer to be completed and they very strongly urge that the question of a postponement of the &quot;appointed day&quot; to March 7th, the latest date to which the appointed day can be postponed in the absence of an agreement between the two Governments, of Ireland, should be considered.They point out also that the possibility, of an alteration -of the boundaries of Northern Ireland may render nugatory much of the work which   Approved Societies would be called upon to do in connection with the transfer on 1st January and further that the changes in the future government of Ireland foreshowed by the Agreement of December 6th might in a very short time affect the whole system of Health Insurance in Ireland.     In   these circumstances they suggest that the two Governments might wishto/
to take advantage of an immediate postponement in order to come to an agreement to postpone the &quot;appointed day&quot; beyond 7th March under the provisions of Section 73 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.I have been informed by the Minister of Labour for Northern Ireland that the Government of Northern Ireland are aware of the administrative difficulties of a transfer at such short notice but, on political ground, are averse from any consideration of the postponement of the &quot;appointed day&quot;.     The Minister of Labour has suggested that some at least of the difficulties could.be overcome if the Imperial Government, through the Irish Insurance Commissioners, were to exercise an agency on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland for a month or two.     Sir Alfred Watson&apos;s Committee doubt whether any arrangement of this kind would help to sol^e the immediate difficulties unless the Governments were prepared to countenance a direct conflict with the terms of the Insurance Statutes which would be involved.In all the circumstances, I am Inclined to think that, in spite of the administrative and legal difficulties to which the Committee draw attention, the political considerations are so important as to render a&apos; postponement of the &quot;appointed day &quot; inadvisable.     But in view of the weighty representations made by Sir Alfred Watson1s Committee I feel that I should bring the matter to the notice of the Cabinet,Ministry of HealthA. MOITD. 9 .,12.1921.
WELLINGTON HOUSE, Buckingham Gate,London, S * W* 7th December, 1921.Right Hon. Sir Alfred Mond, Bart., M.F., Chairman,National Health Insurance Joint Committee.Sir,1.       The Committee, of which I am Chairman, appointed by the National Health Insurance Joint Committee on October 18th &quot;to consider the steps necessary to carry out the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in respect of National Health Insurance&quot; have now completed their Report.     Since the Committee began their Investigations, the appointed day for the transfer to the Government of Northern Ireland of Health Insurance services in respect of that part of Ireland has been fixed by Order in Council for the 1st January, and in view of the agreement come to between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Irish Delegation the Committee assume that an early day for the transfer in respect of Southern Ireland la to be anticipated.     The Committee have been so much impressed by the difficulties which will arise in connection with a transfer at very short notice that, though this matter is not within the terms of their reference and could not therefore be dealt with in their Report, they feel bound without delay to draw your attention to It in order that, If you should think fit, you may bring it to the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2.       In order to help them In preparing their recommendations as to administrative changes affecting approved societies, the Committee have sought the assistance of the various classes of approved societies carrying on business in Ireland, that is to say, &quot;international1 approved societies carrying on business in Ireland and in other parts of the United Kingdom, and societies with their
headquarters in Dublin and in Belfast respectively, includingsocieties of varying political and religious complexion cateringfor insured persons in all parts of Ireland.     On tho 30thNovember the Committee received a joint deputation representativeof all Irish nocietles, constituted as follows:-Mr. J.D. Nugent,  (Ancient Order- of Hibernians)President of the Approved Societies&quot; Association of Ireland,Mr. J.G. Gillow&amp;y, Honorary Secretary     &quot;Mr. M.P. 0&apos;Donne 11, Assistant Secretary   &quot;Mr* W. St. 0* Perrott, Union Friendly Society.Mr. K.M. Alexander, Presbyterian Health Insurance Society,Mr. R.G. Noble, Orange and Protestant Friendly Society,and Mr, F.J. Grant, Down and Connor Catholic Benefit Society *The members of this deputation with surprising unanimity pressedupon the Committee the desire of all the Irish societies thatthe Health Insurance service In Ireland should continue to be administered as at present and should not be divided, for thepurpose of transfer to the. Governments of Southern and NorthernIreland respectively.     Whether the recent change In the irish situation has affected the societies&apos; attitude on this questionwe have no means of knowing;   but In any event it was, cf course,not possible for us to discuss any suggestion of the kind,3.       The Committee invited the societies, therefore, toconsider with them what administrative arrangements would benecessary in connection with the transfer of the Health Insuranceservice to the Government of Northern Ireland on the appointed day and this the deputation agreed to do.     In the course of thediscussion which followed the deputation referred at some lengthto the permanent difficulties involved in the transfer, but theylaid particular stress upon the Initial difficulties andcomplications which, in their view, would immediately arise inconnection with the actual process of transfer and urged thatthese would be aggravated by a transfer at short notice&quot;.
4.       The Committee are satisfied that many of the apprehensions of the societies with regard to permanent difficulties in the transfer of the service to the two Irish Governments are exaggerated and they think It unnecessary to trouble you with them. But having explored the whole field and having ascertained what work has to be done, both by the Departments&quot;concerned and by the societies, the Committee are bound to agree with the societies as to the difficulties caused by the fixing of the appointed day as the 1st January next, and they conceive it to be their duty as officials concerned in the administration of Health Insurance to bring this matter directly to your notice.     Tho steps preliminary to the division into two parts of a complicated system, the creation of two central controlling bodies in the place of one, and the administrative and financial adjustments involved (with which the Committee deal at length in their Report), are such as to make it in their opinion very difficult for satisfactory working arrangements to be completed within the short period which remains before Kanuary 1st.5.       In the circumstances the Committee feel bound to submit to you for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government the advisibility of a postponement of the appointed day to March 7th, 1922, being the latest date to which the &quot;appointed day&quot; can be postponed in the absence of such an agreement as is referred to in the next paragraph.6c       Beyond the difficulties with which this recommendation Is intended.to deal, the Committee are now faced with the possibility that the boundaries of the areas in respect of which separate accounts have in future to be kept may be different from those provided by the Government of Ireland Acts     They are convinced that if instructions are issued to societies to proceed upon a certain basis as to boundaries on the 1st January and that basis is subsequently altered a state of great confusion, in regard to the accounts of the societies, will be created.      In the Committee&apos; s opinion this new factor Is not the least serious of the diffIcultios
-131 Iby which the approved societies are faced, and they consider it essential that an opportunity should be given -to the two Governments J of Ireland, if the need arises, to enter into an agreement further to postpone the &quot;appointed day&apos;1 under section 73 of the Government of Ireland Act.     This opportunity can only be given if the &quot;appointed day&quot; for Northern Ireland is now postponed for a short period, and the sarae date fixed for the transfer of the correspondirg service to Southern Ireland.7.     The need for securing the possibility of a further postponement appears to the Committee the more pronounced in that the changes in the future Government of Ireland predicated by the Agreement of December 6th may profoundly affect the whole system of National Health Insurance in Ireland as it exists today.   They feel it to be essential on the one hand that the two Governments should have ample opportunity of considering, possibly together, the consequences to National Health Insurance of these changes and on the other hand that the approved societies should be given such opportunity as is possible to go on with their work untrammelled by successive changes in the instructions issued to them as to their methods of administration.8.      It is right that I should add that my colleague who represents the Government of Northern Ireland on the Committee feels unable to associate himself with the recommendation made in this letter.     He is willing, as an alternative and in order to secure good relations with the societies, to meet their wishes so far as that can be done by the setting up of agency arrangements under.&apos; section 63 of the Act for a short period.     He agrees that the admlnistrativo difficulties in conneccion with the transfer that have been indicated by officials of Irish societies have been exaggerated.     He thinks that such of those difficulties as may be entailed by the early date of the transfer may be met by continuing the present administration on an agency basis for a short period after the 1st January in order that the&apos; societies may have an extension of time to put into operation the machinery adjustments
which the Committee have indicated as necessary in their Report.9.     The Committee regret that they are unable to advise that this is an expedient to which recourse might be had in order to avoid a postponement of the &quot;appointed day&quot;.     If the pro-visional Government of Southern Ireland (or the Imperial Govem-ment acting through the Irish Insurance Commissioners until the provisional Government is established) undertook the responsibility of administration for a period, on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland, It would still be necessary, in the opinion of the Committee, to make all the accounting arrangements required to enable the agent to account exactly for the disbursements made by him on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland. They hold, fuvthisr, that if the service is transferred. as from the 1st January separate National Health Insurance Funds must be set up as from that date, as from which, also, all debits and credits as between those Funds and the approved societies must be properly made.     They cannot agree that the authority conferred upon Departments by section 63 to enter into agency arrangements could be interpreted to justfiy the maintenance of undivided accounts for the whole of Ireland until some date subsequent to the &quot;appointed day&quot;.     Their difficulties do not arise so much from financial considerations as from the direct conflict with the terms of the statute which the proposal involves.     The Committee could not recommend His Majesty^ Government to con-sider an arrangement which might be challenged in the Courts. If, however, the fact that agency arrangements had been entered into did not avoid the necessity   for the setting up of properly-separated accounts from the 1st January, the arrangements would be useless to avert the confusion Into which, the Committee fear that the approved societies would be thrown by the imposition upon them of new duties at such extremely short notice;   more-over, the confusion would be Intensified, as explained above,
if after opening separated accounts on 1st January the societies were subsequently compelled by a change of boundaries to revise much of the work, in connection with the transfer, which they had been required to do,I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) ALFRED W. WATSON.
