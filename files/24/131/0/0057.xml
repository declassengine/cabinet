[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.,]&quot; &quot;German Reparations : The Need for a Readjustment of the Present Schedulh:of Payments.THE years since 1914 have entirely upset the economic balance of the world: the war has impoverished belligerents and neutrals alike, not excluding the United States of America and Japan for all that their relative position has been improved. The political upheavals arising out of the war have cut off a large number of people from among our customers altogether for the time being; and owing mainly to the political weakness and inexperience of most of the new Governments of Europe, whether in newly formed States such as the Succession States of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire or in the new Republics such as Germany, suddenly replacing old and stable monarchies, the years since the Armistice have witnessed a progressive degringolade in Governmental finance. This last factor is probably even more important than the war in its effect on the purchasing power of former customers of British commerce, which suffers equally whether their purchases used to take the form of British goods or of raw material from other countries, such as China, India, Brazil, which in turn spent the proceeds in British goods.To crown these chaotic conditions come the problems of German (and other) Separation Liabilities and of Inter-Allied Indebtedness. The latter is as yet an uneasy threat in the background only, whose main effect at the moment is probably that it slightly depresses the exchange values of the currencies of Europe below their internal values. The former problem is very present. On the one hand, Germany threatens to collapse, financially, socially and politically, as the result of the efforts of a weak Government to fulfil an obligation which is probably in any case impossibly burdensome in the early years of the Reparation Schedule. On the other hand, there is the danger that in her frantic efforts to produce and sell exportable goods Germany may destroy the export trade of her neighbours, and in particular that of the United Kingdom.The most recent statistics of Germany&apos;s export trade suggest that this latter danger is grossly exaggerated. But the contrast between the position of this country with nearly 2,000,000 Unemployed and Germany with scarcely any unemployed is sufficiently striking, and it becomes really important to understand, and make the public understand, the truth, the more so because in spite of his robust common sense the man in the street is beginning to believe what some interested industrialists are telling him, so that he seems almost to be ready to subscribe to&apos; the false doctrine that it is good for trade that a Government by inflationary finance should habitually spend more than its income, and that it is necessarily bad for a country to receive a large income from abroad by way of an indemnity.No sober-minded German believes that the present economic and financial condition of Germany is other than disastrous, and even the German industrialist knows that the present activity of German industry is a sign of fever and not of prosperity. But, as usual, each class in Germany thinks that the burden of the taxation and the other remedies needed to save the situation should fall on some other class or classes. Moreover, there is little doubt that, both in Government circles in Germany and still more among the representatives of big business, the hope is entertained that the evidences of coming, collapse, which are accumulating on all sides, and especially the fall in the exchange value of the mark, will convince Germany&apos;s ex-enemies of the impossibility of the present Reparation Schedule. Even the best disposed Germans are inclined, in a fatalistic way, to let things take their course and wait for the world to recover its reason. The big industrialists meanwhile are attempting to save something from the wreck by turning all the paper marks they can get hold of into foreign currencies, or failing that, into&apos; real things land, machinery, &amp;c. which have a value independent of the paper mark. The result is that every German who can do so is competing against his own Govern- &apos;m ment, whose efforts to secure foreign currency with which to pay for reparation and&apos;SECRET.MEMORANDUM PREPARED IN THE TREASURY.[7405]
other foreign charges are thus rendered hopeless. And the mass of the people meanwhile hastens to spend all the paper marks that come into its pocket before their purchasing value is further reduced. The incentive to saving is&apos;gone just when saving is of vital necessity to the State. All the State&apos;s efforts to increase taxation and reduce expenditure go for next to nothing owing to the rapid rise of prices. Subsidies and salaries instead of being reduced have to^ be increased, the budget deficit grows, and the burden of the reparation payments becomes infinitely more oppressive, not only through the increasing cost in terms of paper marks of the foreign currencies required, but also through the ridiculously low value in terms of gold marks (the currency in which reparation payments are valued) of deliveries of coal and other deliveries in kind on reparation account, which is one of the incidental results of the fall in the value of the paper mark. This last difficulty is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the 1,800,000 tons of coal which Germany delivers each month, mainly to France, will be credited to Germany on reparation account at less than half as much in October as in August.The fall in the mark is gradually wiping out the middle classes, the value of the whole of whose investments in Government and Municipal bonds, in debentures, (fee-is rapidly disappearing. A holding of 1,000,000 marks of German War Loan which corresponded to a holding of from  40,000 to  50,000 British Government War Loan during the war has now a sterling value of about  1,000, and even its internal purchasing power in Germany is not more than  3,000, and is rapidly falling. A German pensioner with an income of 10,000 marks before the war compared favourably with an English pensioner with an income of  500. To-day the sterling Value of his pension is  10, and its purchasing power not more than  30. Insurance policies in Germany are now worth less to the holder or his widow than the annual premium which he put by each year out of his hard-earned savings. The Rent Restriction Acts hit much the same classes, who are thus forced to starvation in order to subsidise the German workman&apos;s wages and the employers profits. The bread subsidy, the railway subsidy financed by inflation, combined with the Rent Restriction Acts enable the foreigner to buy German goods well below world prices, and if he lives in or visits Germany to: obtain the advantages of travelling on German railways, eating German bread and occupying German houses at ridiculously cheap rates. A gradual process of buying up and carrying off Germany&apos;s movable capital, second-hand furniture, pianos, &amp;c, is taking place for the benefit of foreigners and at the expense of Germany as a whole.&quot; Further, those foreigners who are speculatively inclined are enabled to buy up real property in Germany, and obtain interests in factories, businesses, &amp;c, at prices very unremunerative for Germany. All this is done at the expense of Germany as a whole, to some extent at the expense of the workman whose wages lag behind the advancing cost of living, but mainly at the expense of the middle classes, whose capital fund is destroyed and to a large extent exported.Thus, while the German industrialists are making large paper profits and the German workman is being kept in employment at the expense of the German Exchequer and the German middle classes, on balance Germany as a whole loses heavily. The industrialist who makes goods for export may be able to keep his head above water so long as he can buy his raw materials from abroad at a price in paper marks which does not entirely eat up his paper profits. Even this, however, becomes impossible when the mark drops from 600 to the  1 to 1,000 to the  1, as it did in the first week in November. The industrialist who makes goods mainly for the home market out of raw material partly imported cannot possibly replace that raw material with a continually and rapidly falling mark.The one real temporary advantage for Germany is that her workmen are in employ, but even this is mainly due, not to^ successful export business, but to tie misdirected consumption of holders of paper marks who want to get rid of them, and therefore to misdirected production which actually interferes with the proper flow of exports, and to some extent increases the amount of luxury imports. If some halt is not called, the outcome can only be an absolute collapse of the whole financial machine and the destruction of the mark as a medium of exchange : even a halt and a cessation of paper currency issues threatens a financial and&quot; economic crisis in Germany of the severest character to which the troubles in this country since March 1920 would be insignificant in proportion.&quot; The manufacturer will find his profits disappear completely as wages catch up to the falling value of the mark and they are bound to do so once the fall is checked--indeed the mere cessation of new currency inflation would probably quickly lead to an improvement in the external value of the
mark to a point at which internal prices would he temporarily in excess of world prices. This happened in Germany in the early summer of 1920 and at once caused widespread difficulty. At the same time the manufacturer will.feel the full brunt, not only of the additional cost in wages, &amp;c, due to the abolition of bread and railway subsidies and rent restrictions, but also of the additional taxes. Neither of these can be avoided if the budget is to be balanced, and unless the budget is balanced the fall in the mark cannot be checked.That the Government has been or is deliberately pursuing a policy of inflation so disastrous for any Government that adopts it is sufficiently disproved. It is partly weakness and inexperience which have prevented greater success attending the Governmenfs efforts to stop the debacle. But the main reason for the Govern-ment&apos;s failure is that the task has been rendered impossible by the magnitude of the financial and economic burdens imposed upon Germany in the early years after the Armistice. Germany has been stripped bare of much of her working capital, ships, machinery, rolling-stock, &amp;c, under the heads of reparation and restitution, has had her internal economic organisation impaired by occupation and threats of occupation, as well as by loss of territory, and by the costs of occupation. The. pre-war debts liability under the Clearing House system has been a heavy addition to other financial obligations. Then when in May 1921 at last the Schedule of Payments fixed the maximum liability, the demand for a milliard of gold marks in three months (which the Germans had rather foolishly offered) and some 3 milliards in the first reparation year to May 1922 has proved beyond Germany&apos;s immediate , capacity.The total burden imposed by the Schedule of Payments may well be within Germany&apos;s powers, but only on condition that a breathing space is given during the first few years. France&apos;s need for cash is so urgent that she has been unwilling to hear of postponement, but the time has now come when the- alternative to postpone-ment is final abandonment of any hope of reparation at all.&quot;That it is clearly to the detriment of British interests that Germany should collapse may be taken as a self-evident proposition. The paramount interest of the British Isles is to keep their 46,000,000 inhabitants fed and employed, and this is hot possible if the whole population of Germany and consequently of other central European countries loses its purchasing power. It follows that the maintenance of a figure for Germany&apos;s reparations liability which is too high for Germany&apos;s capacity is entirely bad for British interests.But it does not f.follow that for Britain to receive her due share of what Germany can pay is contrary to British interests. Before the war this country regularly drew by way of interest and profits on money employed abroad a sum approaching  200,000,000 a year, and annually growing larger. Yet it had no more, difficulty than most other industrial countries in keeping its factories busy and its workmen employed. The problem how to receivethis large annual income from abroad was solved partly by the establishment of a higher average standard of comfort and Luxury among the people of this country and partly by the annual investment of new sums abroad for the development of hew areas of the world and the propagation and education of new customers for British goods.   &apos;Although the war has impoverished this country, it is still on balance a creditor country, even taking into account the debt to the United States Government and leaving out of account the debts due by the Allies. If everything else had remained unchanged except the debtor and creditor accounts between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, there would have been no great difficulty in so adjusting the economic life of the United Kingdom as to permit the regular payment of interest and sinking fund on the present debt to the United States of America. All that would have been necessary would have been the use by the Government of a part of the annual &quot;export&quot; surplus for paying the United States of America, additional taxation being imposed to secure this amount of the surplus for Govern-ment use instead of being invested abroad. Those who argue that receipt of repara-tion will damage British interests usually begin by assuming that the whole of the exports from Germany which she uses to pay reparation to the United Kingdom must necessarily replace British exports. This is an obvious fallacy. Why should it be any more detrimental to British trade that the British Government should receive  30,000,000 a year or thereabouts from Germany than it was before the war for the British nation to receive some  200,000,000 a year from abroad as interest and profits on foreign investments? On the contrary, if once the reparation system were working smoothly, this receipt from Germany would go far to enable the British Government to pay the interest on its debt to the United States
* CP. 3528.Government. In that case the effect of German reparation receipts on British industry would be to relieve it of its share of the taxation which would otherwise be necessary to raise this sum of  30,000,000, and thereby to increase /its effective profits.This factor of taxation is commonly ignored. If Germany could properly balance its budget and raise the sums needed for reparation by effective taxation of Germans, and avoid recourse to the printing press, receipts from Germany by way of reparation could not damage this or any other country receiving reparation, provided that (1) such receipts were wisely used and not wasted, and (2) additional consuming power can be created sufficient to absorb the additional production by Germany of those classes of goods of which Germany and the United Kingdom are both large producers. The second question forms the subject of a separate memo-randum.* As to the first, the most probable form of waste would be the initiation by the recipient Government of expenditure which it would not otherwise have been tempted to incur. The existing dangers to British trade flowing from German reparation are due mainly to the inability or unwillingness of the German Govern-ment to establish a sound Budget in face of the enormous burden which the repara-tion schedule now places upon it. In its efforts to meet this burden the German Government cannot avoid resort to paper currency issues, and the resultant inflation, while absolutely disastrous for Germany financially and economically, is thoroughly detrimental to British trade too.Unless a breathing space is given Germany will destroy herself and injure the world in her efforts to meet her obligations, and in the end very little reparation will be received or paid. Germany cannot suddenly increase her production to the extent needed to meet the present burden mainly because the world equally cannot suddenly increase its consuming power (especially in the chaotic conditions of to-day) to the extent needed to absorb such an increased amount of German products. If for this reason only it is most unfortunate that a scale of reparation payment starting from a much lower figure was not fixed at the outset. It is, however, not too late to remedy this error, but the initial figures must be much lower than would have been possible earlier. A scale progressing from a low starting point will give the world &apos;s consuming power time to expand and so keep pace with the extra production effort demanded of Germany. That extra effort, made possible by the pressure on the average standard of comfort in Germany caused by the taxation imposed in order to pay reparation, will then add to the sum total of useful products placed at the world&apos;s disposal year by year, and thus help to accelerate the world&apos;s peaceful development. Other countries, and riot least the United Kingdom, will profit by this development of the world. In those countries which receive reparation a slightly higher standard of comfort and a slightly lower scale of taxation will be the material form in which reparation benefits will&apos;be actualised.In the United Kingdom the receipt of an extra amount from abroad each year, that is, the possession of a larger surplus of &quot;exports&quot; over &quot;imports,&quot; will necessarily involve an addition to the amount of capital newly invested abroad each year. Indeed, this is the form in which the accelerated development of the world mentioned just above will mainly take effect. Incidentally it may be added that British investments in Germany in one form or other, especially during the earlier years, will be among the most efficient instruments for enabling the reparation payments to be, easily met.November 16, 1921.
