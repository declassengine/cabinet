C R E Tjj,CAE I II T.^-3595. ------........-        -m,a3ARG0^0H OAKADIASST. ftTORE OATTEHi.(Memgrandiim&apos;TyyM the Secretary for, Sect land i?i).1.   I refer to the memorandum on this subject (CP. 3509), submitted by the Minister sf Agriculture and Fisheries on 19th December 1921.   Although, for reasons to be stated, I agree with the Minister that the Government should nob intro-duce legislation in the coming session to remove the embargo-, I differ from him so widely on the merits of the question, and as to the form in which an announcement of any such decision should be made, that I think it right to lay my views very briefly before the Cabineta2.     The Royal Commission - a strong and impartial body -after hearing voluminous evidence from agricultural experts of all shades of npinien, have arrived at a definite finding in favour of the removal of the embargo so far as Canadian cattle is concerned.   They say ^We are&apos;af opinion that such . &quot;admission is advisable as providing another source for supply *r,f stores for the purpose 6f scientific agriculture, with a &quot;consequent increase of the food supply&quot;.   With that finding I respectfully concur.3.     The policy of retaining the embargo is supported mainly on the grounds that its removal may (a) lead to the intro-duction of disease (h) Injure the frame cattle-breeding industry, and (c) adversely affect the milk supply.   The Royal Commission definitely negative the first and third of these contentions, and they were evidently not Impressed by the second. 4,     As regards the introduction of disease, I gather that the Minister&quot;accepts- the finding of the Royal Commission onA
this point,    The. oaso for the retention of the embargo as put by him&apos; rests.solely upon the view that a removal of the embargo would be injurious to the home cattle-breeding industry; and would be resisted by an over-whelm in g majority of tne agriculturists in England-5,    I am by no means satisfied that freedom to import store-cattle from Canada would have any material effect in discouraging home breeding oh lands which are -truly suitable for this purpose.&apos;   The circumstance which gives force to the demand for the removal of the embargo is that the existing sources of. supply of store cattle are insufficient to meet our requirements., bo doubt,  it might be possible largely to  increase breeding at homo, hut my advisers are strongly of opinion, and I concur with them, that a policy of this nature is economically -unsound.    It tends to encourage the use for this purpose cf land which should be under cultivatic.   tor human food. It may be true that the legislative Incentives to a ^plough policy&apos; have largely been removed.&apos;   This, however, does not seem to me to be a reason for maintaining a polio which will still further tend to diminish cultivation. I believe that the sound policy is to encourage not tne breeding, but the fattening, of cattle, and the extension of. dairy farming, a policy which will increase the avail-able meat supply and at the same tline increase the supply of other food products,6.     The production&apos; of British agriculture is motor-iously at a lower level than that of the more progressive European countries whore&apos;the policy of cattle breeding as a means of providing^ supply of human food has long , bsen discouraged or abandoned.    To stimulate cattle   ..-breeding\by maintaining the embargo will encourage the less important side of British agriculture to the detrimen0 x  O ; A    tt   *   a
of the food supply and to the intensification of the problem oi rural depopulation. .7c    I recognise,, however, that agricultural opinion in England is s ,i&apos;ongly against the removal of the embargo, and that in Scotland it is acutely divided, - In-these circumstances, I realise that it is useless -at present to- attempt to- legislate for the removal of the embargo;-&quot; I therefore concur with the suggestion made by the Minister at the foot of page 7 of his memorandum, pro-vided that the reason given .should be not that agriculture would be damaged but rather that the present state of agricultural opinion forbids legislation in the direction proposed,( Sd i j .
