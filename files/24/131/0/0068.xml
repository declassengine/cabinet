[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]THE APPEAL OF THE ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor the Colonies.I HAVE received, in common with the other Members of Parliament, an appeal from the Royal Irish Constabulaxy. I feel most strongly that we are bound in the most exceptional manner to secure the future of these men, and that all those, whether recruited in England or Ireland lately or long ago, who do not willingly take service under the new Government, should be given not only ordinary compensation and pension, but those special compensation terms which are appropriate to the unexpected abolition of offices ; and that these payments shall be guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and form a part of the general arrangement for the settlement of Irish finance which we shall make with the Government of the Irish Free State.Downing Street, W. S. C.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP. 3567.THE   CABINET.December 17, 1921.[7506]
