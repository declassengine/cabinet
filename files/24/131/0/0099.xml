It is almost impossible to enforce effectually the differing regulations or for the driver of a vehicle to know what regulations are in force in the particular area in which he may happen to find himself, or what significance to attach to the lights he sees on the road.
A special feature of urgency is the lighting of ordinary bicycles, the War Regulations rendering it necessary for a rear light to be carried having lapsed.In accordance with the recomrnendations of the Committee it Is also desired to confer on the Minister power to make regulations to minimise the effect of dazzle.It is neoessary that the confusion and complication thus arising should be swept away and a uniform system of lighting made compulsory in every part of the country, and I ask leave to introduce the necessary Bill,(Sgd) ARTHUR NEAL.4th January, 1922 0

departmental committee on lights on vehicles.INTERIM REPORT,To the Right Honourable Sir Emc C. Geddes, G.O.B., G.B.E., M.P.,Minister of Transport.Sir,1. We have examined 17 witnesses and have considered a number of written statements from other persons representing the various classes of road, users and other interested parties, including nominees of cyclists, users and manufacturers of all kinds of motor vehicles, motor cycles, animal-drawn vehicles, both commercial and private, also representatives of the police, tramways, omnibus and agricultural interests. Further, we have caused a number of tests as to the efficiency and suitability of various lighting devices to be carried out by a Technical Sub-Committee and have examined witnesses from some of the large manufacturers of all descriptions of lamps.2. Up to the present we have given our attention mainly to the question of the retention or modification of the requirements of the present Lights (Vehicles) Order of 30th, September, 1919,and the corresponding Order (the Lights on Vehicles (Scotland) Order of 2nd October, 1919)* applying in Scotland. Under these Orders, made by the Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland respectively, under Regulation 11 of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, lighting-up time is fixed at half-an-hour after sunset till half an-hour before sunrise throughout the year ; two front lights must be carried on all vehicles (except bicycles, pedal tricycles and handcarts, on which one front light must be carried); and a separate red rear light must be carried on all vehicles except handcarts.3. The requirements of the present Lights (Vehicles) Orders had been in force during the war under Part I. of the Lights (Vehicles) Order of 9th October, 1916, and the corresponding Order of 25th October, 1916, applying in Scotland (except that lighting-up time in Scotland was from one hour after sunset till one hour before sunrise). These Orders also included, in Part II., provisions with regard to the obscuring of headlamps on motor cars. After the Armistice the requirements of Part I. of these Orders were continued while the restrictions on the use oE headlamps were considerably relaxed and confined to lamps of large size and power. The Orders were revoked in August, 1919, but it wras found necessary to re-impose the require-ments of Part J. during the railway strike, and the Orders then made are, as above stated, still in force.4. Having regard to the importance of the requirements of these Orders to all vehicle owners and to the fact that they are made under emergency powers and must lapse with those powers, it appeared to us desirable to formulate as soon as possible our conclusions as to whether or not the requirements of the Orders should be permanently retained or amended.5. In this Interim Report, therefore, we deal in detail only with questions arising in connection with the Lights (Vehicles) Orders. The evidence which we have heard up to the present has been directed mainly to these questions, but the witnesses have also dealt in the course of their evidence with various other matters falling &quot;within the scope of our inquiry, particularly the desirability of some restriction on the use of powerful headlights on motor cars, and we state in general terms our views on this subject also, but leave our detailed recommendations thereon to a later Report.C. Briefly stated, our opinions are : (a) that the requirements of the present Lights (Vehicles) Orders are, in the main, essential for the safety of road traffic, but may be relaxed, or require to be supplemented, in certain particulars which we indicate below;(b) that great inconvenience and, frequently, danger arise from the use&apos; of headlamps throwing an unnecessarily intense and wide beam, and that it-is most desirable that means should be found to remove legitimate grounds for complaint in this respect while allowing ample light for safe driving tinder modern traffic conditions.* These Orders arc set out in the Appendix.n  (37)10G5.r)   Wt871   G 3?, 3D0U  introduction   E&amp;s
i47. At the same time, we wish to emphasize the point that the safety oC traffic will not be increased by the measures we recommend unless it is f idly recognised that motor cars must be driven at night at moderate speeds and with proper consideration for the safety of other road users. The safety of pedestrians, for example, will be imperilled if the requirement that a light or lights showing red to the rear are to be carried on vehicles, results in motor cars being driven at excessive speeds or drivers relaxing their vigilance at night in. looking out for aud avoiding pedestrians, vehicles which are unlighted owing to accident or negligence, and other objects on the road the presence of which is not indicated by any warning light.S. We recommend that legislation should be prepared and introduced at the earliest opportunity on the following lines : (a) Lighting-up time for all vehicles to be fixed at half-an-hour after sunset till half-an-hour before sunrise during the winter months, i.e., from the autumn equinox to the spring equinox ; but during the remainder of the year to be from one hour after sunset till one hoiir before sunrise instead of from half-an-hour after sunset till half-an-hour before sunrise, as under the present Orders.(b) Subject to the powers mentioned in (c) a front light or lights and a red rear light to be carried on vehicles as under the present Orders.(c) The Minister of Transport to have power by Order (i) to grant exemption in special cases, e.g., for remote districts, suchas the islands of Scotland, where the traffic is relatively negligible, or for particular classes of vehicles, e.g., vehicles carrying inflammable loads where the light might seriously increase the risk of fire.(ii) to grant exemption under suitable conditions, from the require-ment to carry a separate red rear light in the case of any class of two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle which is adequately lighted by two lamps each displaying a red light to the rear and a white light to the front.(iii) to define the positions in which lamps must be carried, and thedirection in which lights (including red rear lights) must be displayed on motor cars and other vehicles, and to prescribe their capacity.(iv) to make supplementary provisions with regard to the lighting of vehicles carrying overhanging or projecting loads and vehicles drawing trailers.9. With regard to paragraph 8 (c) (ii) above, we have no intention of relieving any vehicle from the obligation to show a red light to the rear, but we recognise that, in practice, certain vehicles can give an adequate indication of their presence on the road by means of such front lamps.10. With regard to paragraph 8 (c) (iv) above, we consider it important that such Orders should provide that the rear lamp shall be placed at the extreme rear end of any projecting load.11. We have given our special attention to the question if the requirements of safety would be met by the use of a &quot; reflex &quot; lens instead of a red rear light on bicycles and other vehicles. On the evidence which has been submitted and the tests which have been carried out as to the efficiency of various types of &quot; reflex &quot; lenses we cannot recommend the xise of this device as a substitute for a lamp showing a red light to the rear. The main objection to &quot;reflex&quot; lenses, even of the best type, is their failure to yield, uniform results in ordinary use under varying conditions of atmosphere and weather. The &quot;reflex&quot; lens may be visible to the driver of a fol-lowing vehicle if the latter carries powerful headlights and is directly behind the &quot;reflex,&quot; but we are satisfied from the evidence and from the tests which, we have conducted that in other conditions, e.g., on a winding road or if the following vehicle carries lights of only moderate intensity, or the &quot; reflex &quot; lens is obscured by mud or dirt, as frequently occurs, it cannot be relied upon. Various objections to the use of a separate red rear lamp, e.g., extra trouble and expense, extra weight to be carried, and the difficulty in keeping such lamps alight, were urged by witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of cyclists, but none of these considerations would, in our opinion, justify the exemption of bicycles from the general requirement that a lamp showing a red light to the rear should be carried.
12. The witnesses from the lamp manufacturers satisfied the Committee by their evidence that suitable and reliable rear lamps for bicycles can be manufactured by them, and will be put on the market to meet any such requirement.13. We feel, however, that it is desirable to avoid, so far as possible, the duplication of lamps to be carried on bicycles, and are of opinion that, should it be found practicable to devise a single lamp showing a white light to the front and a red light to the rear, which can be fixed in such a position on the bicycle as to ensure the free and uninterrupted view of both lights, such a lamp would meet all requirements.14. Finally, we strongly recommend that, pending permanent legislation, the requirements of the present Orders should be retained, the Emergency Statutory powers being continued, if necessary, for that purpose.15. With reference to head lamps on Motor Vehicles, whilst we are still pursuing our investigations with regard to this question and are not yet in a position to make any definite recommendations thereon, we think it may be of interest to state that the evidence we have heard and the results of tests that have been carried out strongly point to the following conclusions, viz. : (a) No satisfactory dimming device to avoid dazzle is yet available because such devices as are effective in this respect unfortunately fail to give a safe driving light, besides wasting a large percentage of light.(b) Some of the headlights now in use are unnecessarily powerful.(c) Pending the solution of the dazzle problem, the candle power of the bulbs or burners and the size of apertures might be limited, as set out in the Appendix hereto.Signed, on behalf of the Committee, -HENRY P. MAYBURY,Chairman.llth February, 1920.MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON LIGHTS ON VEHICLES.Appendix to Interim Report.Tentative standards suggested for adoption under Paragraph 15 (c) of this Interim Report are :  Motor Cars.Not more than two headlights shall be used on any motor vehicle. The diameter of the clear glass aperture of such headlamps must not exceed 7 inches. Larger lamps may be,used provided that obscuring discs of a solid and opaque material limiting the clear glass diameter to 7 inches are fitted.The electric bulbs used must not exceed 24 c.p. each.The burner of acetylene lamps must not consume more than 21 litres (or J cubic foot) per hour. Motor Cycles.The diameter of the clear glass aperture of head lamp must not exceed 5 inches.

Eric Geddes, G-.C.B., G.B.E., M.P., Minister of Transport.Sir,As a member of the Departmental Committee on Lights on Vehicles, I beg to state that I emphatically, totally, and fundamentally disagree with the majority Interim Report, dated llth February, 1920, so far as that Report relates to (1) the alleged necessity of rear-lights on pedal-, or foot-propelled bicycles, and (2) the alleged impracticability of satisfactorily dimming dazzling headlights on motor-vehicles.(Signed) &quot;   W. G. HOWARD GRITTEN.21st Feb. 1920.10635
departmental committee on lights on vehicles.second interim report.To The Right Honourable Sir Eric C. Geddes, G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P.,Minister of Transport.Sir,1. Since submitting their first Interim Report, dated the 11th February, 1920, the Committee have continued their inquiries and have decided to make certain further recommendations which they consider should be submitted at. once, in the hope that such recommendations, together with those set out in the First Interim Report, will provide a satisfactory scheme for the lighting of vehicles, excepting the question of dazzle or glare from headlights with regard to which further investigation is necessary.The matters covered by this Report comprise  (a) The carrying of lights with animals ;(6) The lighting of towing and towed vehicles ;(c) The carrying of rear lights on certain handcarts ;(d) The Orders to be made by the Minister of Transport.2. (a) The Carrying of Lights -with Animals. The Committee have considered the question of reimposing the requirements of the lights (Driving of Animals) Order, 1916,* as to the carrying of a light or lights by persons in charge of animals being driven on the roads by night. The Committee fully recognise the advantage of all road traffic and obstructions being lighted by night, as far as is reasonably practicable, but each type of traffic and obstruction must be considered on its merits, with due regard to the convenience of all classes of road users.    6The Committee have no doubt that a requirement that a light or lights must be carried with all animals on the road at night would conduce to the safety of driven animals and of motor traffic. Such a requirement is of special importance in the case of animals on the main traffic roads of the country which are regularly used by fast moving through traffic. On the other hand, it is not possible to secure that lights should be carried with all animals upon the highway, owing to the fact that the roads, particularly where they pass through unenclosed and comnmn land, cannot be kept clear of stray animals ; moreover, a requirement that a light is to be carried whenever an animal is driven on a lane or unimportant by-road used almost exclusively by local inhabitants, would entail considerable hardship and expense on the agricultural community, without adding materially to the safety of the public.For these reasons the Committee do not recommend the immediate reimposition of the requirements of the Lights (Driving of Animals) Order, 1916, but are of opinion that the adoption of those requirements on the principal roads of the country should be further considered when such roads have been classified and marked as such.The members of the Committee who represent the views of the Police in England and Wales, however, desire it to be placed on record that the experience of the Police generally was that the Order was of great service as a safeguard against accidents, not only in rural areas but also in places which are purely urban, and even in the heart of London.3. (b) The Lighting of Towing and Toioed Vehicles. The Committee have considered the desirability of requiring lights to be carried at night on towed vehicles, and they recommend that, when, any vehicle is drawn on the highway by any other vehicle, both vehicles shall be independently and fully lighted, unless the distance between the rearmost point of the towing vehicle and the foremost point of the towed vehicle does not exceed five feet; the drawbar, and the fittings for its attachment, not to be reckoned as part of either vehicle for the purposes of such measurement.4. (c) The Carrying of .Rear Lights on certain Handcarts. The Committee recommend, in order to secure uniformity, that handcarts which measure more thanSf No similar Order was made for Scotland.
six feet in a horizontal line from their front lamp to the rear of such cart or any load being carried therein, shall carry a separate red rear light within six feet of the extreme rear of such cart or load.5. (d) Orders to be made by the Minister of Transport.-&apos;^ Committee have considered in detail the points which, they recommend should be provided for in the Orders recommended in. paragraph S (c) of their First Interim Report, and their conclusions are set out in the following Schedule : Schedule.Column 1.Orders to be made under paragraph 8 (c) of the Coinmiitee&apos;s Interim Report dated llt.li February 1920.Sub-paragraph I.(a) Districts to be exempted, e.g., the Islands of Scotland.(6) Classes of vehicles to be exempted.Sub-paragraph IT.Two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicles to be exempted from carrying a separate rear light.Sub-paragraph III.As to all vehicles required to carry two front lamps.1.

Each such lamp to be placed so that no part of stich load shall project outwards more than 12 inches, measured horizontally, beyond the centre of its reflector. Such light or lights may be used in addition to any side lights or headlights required or permitted&quot; to be carried.(6) On any vehicle carrying a load pro-jecting to the rear, a lamp showing a light to the rear shall be carried so that no part - - of such load shall project more than sixfeet, measured horizontally, beyond such lamp. Such lamp may be carried in addition to the normal rear lamp.The ConnnitteeV attention has been drawn to the possibility of its being found convenient or desirable in practice for vehicles engaged on any special duty or for any special purpose to be distinctively lighted, and they consider that the powers of the Minister of Transport, as to the making of Orders, should enable him to provide for such cases.If the above recommendations are adopted, paragraph 8 (c) (iii) of the Committee&apos;s First Interim Report will require amending so as to include power to the Minister by Order : (a) To prescribe the number of lights to be carried.(b) To exempt from or vary or add to the requirements as to the number and colour of the light or lights to be carried on any vehicle or vehicles while used on any special duty or for any special purpose.
RESERVATION BY Mr. W. G. HOWtARD GRITTEN, M.P., RELATIVE TO DAZZLING HEADLIGHTS.From the discussions and experiments, at which I have been present, it has seemed to me that the desire of the motorist representatives on the Committee has been to retain such glaring lights as will enable drivers and users of motor vehicles to travel as fast by night as by day. This opinion is confirmed by the sentence in paragraph 0 : &quot; While it is quite easy to avoid dazzle, the effect of most of the devices which do.this satisfactorily is to produce an unsafe driving light.&quot; It is pertinent to. observe that, while the admission is here made that satisfactory dimming devices are easily procurable or available, the words &quot; unsafe driving light &quot; obviously imply and refer to the safety of motorists rather than that of other users of the road, and that the caprice of motor drivers is more to be considered than the. rights and conveniences of others. I submit that the avoidance of danger both to himself and others on the road depends more upon the care, considerateness and skill of the driver than on the intensity of his light, and that a duly moderated light may and can be an efficient light for all purposes.(Signed)      W. G. HOWARD GRITTEN.6. Dazzling Headlights. With reference to the question of dazzling headlights, the Committee have examined a large number of devices to reduce or eliminate dazzle, and new suggestions and ideas as to the best method of so doing are constantly being brought before them. The problem is, however, one of very considerable complexity, because, whilst it is quite easy to avoid dazzle, the effect of most of the devices which do this satisfactorily is to produce an unsafe driving light. Due consideration has also to be given to questions of cost. Jt appears undesirable for the Committee to recommend the adoption of any particular device or patent. They would rather, if possible, recommend that the light given by all headlights should comply with some standard of illumination ascertained at various points. With a view to fixing such a standard as will be satisfactory, they propose to subject all ideas and devices submitted to them to a series of practical road tests, by experts, under all Conditions. The carrying out of such tests will necessarily take some considerable time, and the Committee regret that they will not be. able to make any further recommendations on this subject, beyond those contained in paragraph 15 of their First Interim Report, until the tests above-mentioned have been completed.(Signed)      HENRY P.

DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON LIGHTS ON VEHICLES.THIRD INTERIM REPORT.The Right Hon. Sir ERIC GEDDES, G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P.,Minister of Transport.Dazzle.Sir,1. Since the submission of their second interim report dated the 31st March, 1920, the Committee have been engaged in further investigating the problem of dazzle from, lights on vehicles. As the question has engaged public attention it is thought advisable to set out at once the conclusions at which the Committee have arrived, without waiting for a final report.2. As stated in their previous interim reports, the problem before the Committee has been to define some method of avoiding dazzle, more particularly from headlights, whilst at the same time providing a safe driving fight.3. The Committee in the first place directed their attention to the ascertainment of (1) the conditions constituting dazzle, and (2) the requirements of a safe driving light. Their con-clusions thereon may be summarised as follows : Dazzle. This may be described as such an intensity of light reaching the eye of an observer as to cause material interference with his normal vision, under the conditions existing at the time of observation.Safe Driving Light. A safe driving light, from the point of view of a driver, must of necessity depend upon the speed at which the vehicle is being driven, its effective braking capacity and the then existing atmospheric and road conditions. Consequently the amount of light reasonably necessary varies considerably with the class of vehicle.4. With regard to dazzle as described above, the Committee are satisfied that its pre-vention under every condition and circumstance is at present unattainable, consistently with a safe driving light. At the same time they desire to place on record their opinion that many complaints of excessive dazzle arise iargely from faulty adjustment of bulbs in electric lamps, and inaccurate setting of the lamps upon their brackets. The correct adjustment of the lighting equipment of the car is liable to become disturbed on service, and failure to remedy such defects is the cause of much needless and preventable dazzle. More attention should be paid to the proper adjustment of lamps.5. Having reached the conclusion that the elimination of dazzle, under every condition, is not attainable with the retention of a satisfactory driving light, the question becomes one of compromise. This it would appear can best be achieved in practice by regulating the1 range and dispersion of the light required to give adequate illumination.6. With this object in view the Committee have caused very extensive experiments to be made, and they desire to record their obligation to designers and manufacturers of motor vehicle lamps who have rendered great assistance in submitting, for examination and test, samples of the best standard electric lamps of to-day and devices put forward as a solution of the dazzle problem.7. Over one hundred lamps and devices to be affixed to lamps have been thoroughly examined and submitted to laboratory tests, the more promising being further submitted to searching road tests under driving conditions. Some of these show great merit, and sufficient progress has been made to foreshadow very considerable improvement in the near future. They may conveniently be described as falling into two classes : (a) Fittings to be added to existing lamps to confine, break up, soften or diffuse the beam.(b) Modifications in design of the lamp by which improved control over the beam of lightis attained.Those falling within (a) lead, however, to such in reduction in the driving light as to render them unsuitable generally as a satisfactory and final solution of the problem for the faster moving vehicles.Those falling within (b) are of a much more promising character. They appear capable of great improvement and show a reasonable prospect of eventually affording a satisfactory solution of the problem. &apos;(34143-12)  Wt. 13739-487/300 1250  10/21 H St   Q. 6 A2
A large number of devices combine the characteristics of both types. In these the front glass of the lamp is moulded or adapted to modify, confine or disperse the light : a method that has been largely developed in America, With the majority, however, it has been found that the driving light is much sacrificed in order to secure a partial elimination of dazzle.8. The result of the experiments and investigations carried out by the Committee shows, as previously stated, that it is not at present practicable to eliminate dazzle and yet retain a safe driving light under all conditions, but that it is possible.to control, confine and direct the light from a headlamp in any required direction with any degree of intensity. It is thus possible materially to restrict dazzle below the eye level of an adult observer walking or driving towards a headlight.   This is a material gain.9. One of the great difficulties that has been experienced by designers and manufacturers of lamps in carrying out experiments is that they have not had available any authoritative state-ment of the conditions with which it is desirable headlights should comply, as regards the elimination of dazzle. The Committee therefore concentrated their attention upon an endeavour to lay down such conditions pursuant to the conclusions arrived at in paragraph 5 of this report. There is ample indication that, if these conditions are made public, lamps complying with them will be constructed very shortly.10. These conditions are set out in Appendix 1 to this report, and, if lamps are constructed in accordance therewith, there is every reason to believe that the resulting light will be found satisfactory, both from the point of view of the driver of a vehicle carrying such lamps and that of vehicular and pedestrian traffic approaching them.It will be observed that the driving light proposed consists of : (1) A main beam of light restricted (a) in its height from the ground, to avoid dazzling an observer approaching the source of light, while he is within the zone which the Committee regard as the danger zone and (b) in intensity between a maximum and a minimum.(2) A secondary diffused light, which may.be obtained from either the headlamps or side lamps.11. The Committee consider that the minimum and maximum distances suggested will provide adequate illumination for driving by night at any speeds at which it is considered vehicles can be driven upon1 public highways with due regard to public safety.12. The provision of a main beam alone, of the character above described, has not been found by practice to be satisfactory, either from the point of view of the driver of the vehicle or from that of other road users, because it does not give sufficient general illumination in close proximity to and on either side of the vehicte.13. The Committee desire to point out, however, that no lamp complying entirely with the conditions set out in Appendix 1 has yet been submitted to them, and that these conditions are not intended to be in the nature of regulations for headlights, but merely as indications to manufacturers of the class of lamp which it is considered would be satisfactory. Some general experience of lamps produced in accordance with these conditions is desirable before a final report is submitted.14. Pending the production of a famp complying in all respects with the characteristics suggested in Appendix 1, the Committee consider that regulations restricting dazzle to a modified extent should be laid down. Such, regulations would permit of the continued use of existing lamps, provided they are so adapted, by the use of frosted or obscured glass or some other device for diffusing the light above a height of 4 feet from the ground, as to produce a softened and diffused quality of light. This adaptation can be carried out at a small cost, though with some reduction of illumination. Statutory authority would be required to give sanction to such regu-lation and the Committee&apos;s recommendation upon this question, which is set out in Appendix 2 of this report, should, they consider, be brought into operation simultaneously with their recommendations contained in paragraph 8 of their first interim report and paragraphs 3 and 4 of their second interim report.The Committee recognise that the enforcement by the police of regulations upon the lines recommended may present considerable difficulties in practice, and that general compliance there-with can best be attained by co-operation between the lamp manufacturers and the owners of mechanically-propelled vehicles, who it is hoped will realise that the regulations are in the interests of the public using the highways. If such co-operation is attained, the Committee do not anticipate that action by the police would be necessary, save in very rare and exceptional cases.In this connection the Committee desire to point out that the majority of lamps on mechinisation-cally-propelled vehicles are of standard types, and it is anticipated that lamp manufacturers will proceed to the manufacture of suitable devices for use - with the various standard types of lighting equipments which, when fitted, will bring such lighting equipments within the terms of the proposed regulations.Manufacturers should be able to submit to official organisations and authorities, to be approved by the Minister of Transport, such devices, together with specimens of the standard lamps to which they are to be fitted, for test, and such organisations and authorities, after test, should be empowei-ed to issue a certificate specifying the device and the standard types of lamps for which
it is suitable, and lamps referred to in such certificate, when fitted with such appropriate device, should, prima facie, be deemed to comply with the regulations.A similar procedure could be adopted with regard to new types of lamps.By this means owners of mechanically-propelled vehicles should be able conveniently and inexpensively to comply with the requirements laid down.15. Further, in the opinion of the Committee, the test suggested as to whether lamps do or do not comply with the regulations, is one which any individual can, if he chooses, apply for himself with comparatively little trouble.In these circumstances the only cases which would require action, would be those where the owner of a vehicle had not obtained a suitable device or satisfied himself that his lights, as fitted, complied with the regulations. In such cases it is not thought that the owner of the vehicle could have any reasonable cause for complaint if he is put to trouble and inconvenience by being required to have his lamps tested.16. Minimum Lighting Requirements. At the present time the only lights showing to the front which mechanically-propelled vehicles are required to carry are in the nature of navigation lights indicating the presence of the vehicle upon the road, commonly known as sidelights. Many vehicles carry these lights only, and there is no legal requirement as to their intensity.The Committee have given very careful consideration to the question of the desirability of making it compulsory that all mechanically-propelled vehicles, particularly those of the heavier types, should be required to provide a minimum illumination. Whilst there are substantial arguments in favour of such a course, the Committee have come to the conclusion, after con-sultation with the lamp manufacturers, that it is not practicable to impose any such regulation.If any such minimum lighting were imposed, the Committee are satisfied that it would have to be of a character which would prevent entirely the use of oil lamps alone. The Committee are assured it is not practicable to produce an oil lamp which under all conditions and for all vehicles will alone give adequate illumination.The degree of illumination required, from a general safety point of view, varies according to whether the vehicle is being used ini well lighted thoroughfares or unlighted country roads.    Lights which are suitable and ample in well lighted streets are quite inadequate &apos; upon country roads and, conversely, lights which are necessary upon country roads are often undesirable in well lighted streets.In London and many other cities and towns taxi-cabs are fitted with oil lamps only. As they are mainly used in well lighted streets this lighting is quite satisfactory, and a require-in ent that all these vehicles should be fitted with electric or acetylene lamps would impose an undue and unnecessary burden upon; the owners of these vehicles. On the other hand, the Committee are satisfied that in some cases vehicles, particularly heavy mechanically-propelled vehicles, are being driven in unlighted or poorly-lighted areas with lights which are quite in-adequate for the safety of the general public, and, indeed, for the vehicles themselves.Further objections to a compulsory minimum illumination are that in numerous cases it would prove vexatious to the individual and would be almost impossible to enforce from an administrative point of view.In these circumstances the Committee recommend that the attention of owners of mechinisation-cally-propelled vehicles should be drawn to the inadequate lighting frequently used, and that in any proceedings against a driver of a vehicle under Section 1 of The Motor Car Act, 1903, for driving to the danger of the public at night, the question of the adequacy of the lights used on the vehicle under the conditions in which it was being used at the time, should be an element to be taken into consideration by the tribunal before whom the case is brought.17. Swivelling Headlights. Under the existing regulations no headlight may be used as a searchlight beam, and it has been assumed that the use of swivelling headlights moving with the front wheels is debarred. The Committee have considered the use of such headlights, but after careful consideration they are of opinion that such lights are undesirable and should not be permitted.Devices have also been considered which enable the driver at will to tilt the beam downward from its normal position so as to avoid dazzle to approaching traffic of all kinds. The Committee are satisfied that these devices, when used, mitigate the existing inconvenience from brilliant headlights, though they are all dependent upon the courtesy of the driver in making use of them.The Committee feel that pending the production of satisfactory non-dazzle headlights the use of such devices should be permitted provided that (1) where more than one headlight is carried the device must be fixed to all so that they cannot be moved independently, (2) the headlights otherwise comply with the conditions laid down in Appendix 2 and, (3) they should be incapable of any movement relative to the car except at the will of the driver and in a vertical plane.18. Inspection Lamps. Under the existing law it is considered doubtful whether a movable inspection lamp for connection to or connected with the lighting system of the vehicle may be carried and used, and it has been represented to the Committee as very desirable that such a light should be allowed for the purpose of engine inspection or roadside repairs, &amp;c.The Committee recommend that these lamps be permitted provided that no such lamp is lighted or used as or in addition to the side lamps and/or headlamps, except when the vehicle is at rest.
19. Additional driving lamp for use in fog. In the second interim report, on page 8, the Committee recommended that not more than four lamps showing a light to the front be permitted on any vehicle &quot; Except in the case of a vehicle with a load which overhangs later-ally,&quot; two of the lamps then to comply with the provisions as to side lamps.It has been represented that the use of an additional lamp fixed at the side of the vehicle in a low position for the purpose of lighting the side of the road during fog should be permitted, provided that the light therefrom is projected downwards and forwards and not to the rear.The Committee see no objection to such a light, provided that its use is confined to foggy weather, and they accordingly recommend that it be allowed under these conditions.(Signed)       HENRY P.

Howard Gritten, M.P.(1) I consider the references to and definition of safe driving lights unsatisfactory. One of the chief conditions of safe driving is that the! driver should be able to bring his vehicle to a stand still within the distance illuminated by his headlights. The speed should depend on the light, not the light on the speed.(2) I am further of opinion that there should be specified a minimum and also a maximum caudle power for headlights.
APPENDIX 1.Recommendations for Non-Dazziunu MotorV K111OLE   IIEADH (i IMS.A__Definitions.1. For tho purposes of tho recommendations sot out in these Appendices:  (a) &quot; The Standard Specification &quot; means the British Standard Specification for disc for determining the illuminating effect of Automobile driving lamps issued by the British Engineering Standards Associa-tion.(ft) The &quot; range of forward illumination &quot; and the &quot; width of the beam &quot; shall bo deter-mined in accordance with tho method set out in the Standard Specification.(c) &quot; Headlight &quot; means any lamp afffxed to a vehicle which has a range of forward illumination in excess of 60 feet.B. Detailed Specification of headlight for the in-formation and guidance of lamp Designers and Manufacturers.The essential characteristics of a headlight are that when correctly mounted in position on a car or in an equivalent position:  (1) There should be a main beam of light having:   (a) A minimum range of forward illumination of150 feet and a maximum of 300 feet, (ft) A minimum width of 30 feet with a maximum height of 4 feet from the ground at 150 feet from the lamp.(c) The lower edge impinging upon the road atnot more than 50 feet from the face of the headlight.(d) The field free from dark patches   and   theillumination reasonably uniform or having good gradation.(2) In addition to the main beam there should be a field of diffused light with a range of forward illumination not exceeding 50 feet, or less than 25 feet, with a lateral divergence at the road surface of at least 20 feet at a distance of 5 feet forward from the face of the lamp.Note The diffused light mentioned in (2) may bo produced by the light emanating from some or all of the lamps carried on the vehicle.Drawing No. 1 in the Schedule to this Report shows in the form of a diagram, in elevation and plan, the dimensions and characteristics of the light produced in accordance with these recommendations.APPENDIX 2.Final recommendations as to regulations for head-lights can be made only after further experience has been obtained of lamps produced in accordance with Appendix I and referred to in Paragraph 13. Such recommendations will form the subject of a final Report. To provide during the intervening period for the modification of the type of headlight at present in general use, the following conditions should have effect:  Maximum,.1. Each headlight either to have fitted or attached in front of the headlight or in front of the source of light, the mirror or any lens in. the lamp, frosted or obscured glass or some other suitable devico, or to be mechanically adapted, so that when the head-light is correctly fitted on the car (or in an equiva-lent position) it shall not give a range of forward illumination in excess of 150 feet at any point more than 4 feet above the ground.2. The front of any such headlight, when viewed from any point more than 4 feet above the ground, to have a reasonably soft illumination throughout its whole surface without brilliant lines or points of light.APPENDIX 3.Copy Specification issued by the British Engineering Standards Association, 28, Victoria Street, London, S.W.I.No. 151-1921.Proof Subject to Modification.British Standard Spjicivioation von Disc to it Determining the Illuminating Effect of Automobile Driving Lamps.Introduction.The disc and method of testing described in this specification was originated and brought to tho notice of the Association by the Royal Automobile Club. Tho Specification, has been prepared by tho Associa-tion at the instance of the Ministry of Transport and has been adopted as tho British Standard Disc.The disc has been designed as a means for detor-mining the illuminating effect of automobile driving lamps, and provides a standard object of approxi-matcly the same reflective light-value as a person in-conspicuously dressed.Specification.1. Tho British Standard disc shall measure 18 inches in diameter, shall have a true piano surface, and shall bo mounted on any suitable material which will not warp or deform. The mount must not pro-ject beyond the limits of the disc. The face of the disc shall be dead black, with five irregular figures defineated thereon of the forms and in the positions indicated on the explanatory diagram (Fig. 1), and more particularly described in Section 2.For purposes of reference a British Standard disc has been deposited at the National Physical Labor-explanatory.CFig. 1.2. The irregular figures above referred to shall be covered by a series of parallel horizontal dead white lines spaced evenly apart. There shall bo no actual boundary line surrounding or defining the irregular figures. The proportions of the resulting black and white bars shall be as follows :  Black   bars, f inch wide.White bars, 5 inch wide.Note__Alternate black and white bars have beenutilized in order to give to the irregular figures a grey effect so that it may be difficult to visualise .them separately when viewed from a distance. The use of colouring matter to produce this effect is in-admissible as being impossible of standardisation.3. The areas of these irregular figures shall bo as follows:  A. 22 sq. ins.B. 18 sq. ins.C. 20 sq. ins.D. 21 sq. ins.E. 18 sq. ins.To provide for the supply of, and to ensure the use of correctly designed discs, arrangements have been made for the supply of full-size printed paper discs ready for mounting/* These paper discs and copies of this Specification may be obtained from the Royal Automobile Club, Pall Mall, or direct from the offices of the Associa-tion.
4. Method of using tho British Standard Disc  The tost shall Iks carried out on a clear moon-less night without rain or mist, on a level open terrain having low reflective value and with a background of low relleetivo or illuminative power, for example, distant trees. Tho presence of extraneous sources of light, near or distant, which may obtrude themselves upon the vision shall bo avoided. The lamp or lamps to be tested shall he mounted on the car in the position or positions in whioh it or they are fixed when in use, or alternatively, so mounted as to reproduce these positions.In supporting tho disc during tho carrying out of tho tests, no light-coloured or other object which may obtrude itself upon tho eye shall be permitted in tho immediate neighbourhood of the disc, nor within tho beam of light. Any stand or support for the mounted disc must bo as unobtrusive as possible and must he dead black.(a) To Determine the &quot; central axis &quot; of the beam of tight. Tho disc shall be supported with its centre at a height of 4 feet from the ground at a point in front of, and facing directly towards, tho lamp or lamps and at approximately half their estimated illuminating range. A lino shall be marked out through this point parallel to the face of the lamp, or, alternatively, parallel to a lino joining the faces of the two lamps. The disc shall then he moved to the right along this line until the figures on the disc can no longer be distinguished by tho observer, stationed immediately beside the source of light and with his eye level five feet from the ground. It shall then be moved back along the same line until a point is reached at which tho grey figures can be separately visualised, this point being marked. The same pro-cedure shall be carried out on the left, and this point also marked. The position midway between the two points thus found shall be regarded as being on tho central axis of the beam and the line passing through this point and the centre of the source of light shall be adopted as the &quot; central axis &quot; of the beam.(b) To determine the range of forward iUumimt-tion__Tho observer shall bo stationed as indicatedunder (a). The disc shall he placed on the central axis of the beam as determined under (w); with its centre at any desired height from the tground, facing directly towards the lamp or lamps and at such a distance from the source of light that the, irregular figures on tho disc aro invisible to the observer. It shall then he advanced along tho central axis towards the source of light until a point is reached at which tho grey figures can bo Separately visualised. Tho distance from that point to the source of light shall be regarded as tho direct illuminating range of tin; lamp or lamps at tho hoight at which tho disc was placed.(c) To determine the width of the beam. Tho ob-server shall bo stationed as indicated under (a), and the disc placed on tho central axis facing towards the lamp or lamps with its centre at any desired height from tho ground, and at any desired range. It shall be moved to the right along a lino at rlglrb angles to tho central axis until tho figures on the disc can no longer be distinguished. It shall then bo moved back along the same line until a point is reached at which tho grey figures can bo separately visualised. The distance from this point to the central axis is then measured. Tho same procedure shall ho carried out to tho left of tho central axis, this distance also being measured. The sum of the two measurements thus obtained shall denote the width of the beam at the desired range and at the desired height.* [d) To determine the &quot; dazzle range.&quot; -The disc shall be supported with its centre at a height of 4^ feet from the ground. It shall ho placed 6 feet in. rear of a line at right angles to tho central axis and passing across the face of the lamp or lamps, and 6 feet away from tho outside of the nearer lamp on a line parallel to the central axis. It shall bo illuihin-ated by a source of light, without reflectors or lenses, of 1-25 c.p., placed 2 feet from the face of the disc and level with its bottom edge. The light shall be so screened as to bo invisible to the observer. The observer shall place himself on the central axis at such a distance as to render it impossible for him to dis-distinguish tho figures on the disc. He shall then ad-vnnce towards the lamp or lamps along the central axis until lie reaches a point from which he is able to visualise separately the grey figures on the disc. The distance from this point to the lamp or lamps shall be regarded as the &quot; dazzle range.&quot;* The question of &quot; dazzle-range &quot; does not arise in connection with tho Report.
