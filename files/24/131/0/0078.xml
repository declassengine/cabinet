S B 0 R g T* Referred toCommittee of Home Affairs(This dooument id the property of Hi8 Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.)1--5.L&apos; CABINET; )G,P,   3 5/7   home AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.CHILDREN OP UNMARRIED PARENTS BILL. (Reference Cabinet 88 (8l) /Conclusion 7.)The following Memoranduia has been prepared by the Home Seoretary   for the information of the Home Affairs Committee who have beon requested by the Cabinet to advise the Government on the Children of Unmarried Parents Bill - a Private Member*s Bill which was before Parliament last Session.In 1920 a Bill was brought in by Mr. Neville Chamberlain making a number of changes in the Bastardy Laws.   This Bill oame on for a Second Reading Debate on a Friday afternoon in May, 1920, and in the course of the Debate I said that I was bound to oppose most of the provisions of the Bill* but that there were two provisions in it which stood on a different footing from the rest.   The first was a provision providing for legitimation by subsequent marriage, and the second was a provision raising the amount that a putative father might be required to pay under an Affiliation Order.   The proposal for legitimation by subsequent marriage received gonoral support, and the Seoon4 Reading of the Bill was carried by a large majority.   In Committee the promoters jettisoned the greater part of the Bill retaining only the provisions referred to and certain other minor amendments of the Bastardy Aots.   The Bill made no further progress in 1928 but in 1921 Captain Bowyer introduced a Bill in the form in which the Bill of 1920 had left Committee.   To the prinolple of this Bill there was no opposition in the House of Commons; but the drafting of the Clause providing for legitimation by subsequent marriage presented many diffloulties, and when the Bill reached the House of Lords towards the oloso of the Session the Second Reading Debate was adjourned beoause of the need *f reconsidering the technical legal questions involved in this Clause.The prinoiple of the proposal commands general support and, provided a Clause to effect this objeot is properly drawn, the Government ought, I think, to give facilities for a Bill on the subject.There are^ however, great difficulties in settling a proper Clause for this purpose owing te its effeot on the law of property and on existing rights.   These questions require oareful and expert oxaminatlonj and if the Committee agrees that facilities ought to be given tft a Bill I will consult with the Lord Chanoellor with a view to getting a proper Clause drafted.   When such a Clause has been settled, Captain Bowyer or some other Private Member whs is interested in the subjeot might be given a copy and told that if a Bill is introduced containing the settled Clause and the Government find that it oommands general support, facilities will he given so far as may be practicable.E. S.      -eoember, 1921, S.F.4.13.
