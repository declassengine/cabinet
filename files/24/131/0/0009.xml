Demonstrations of unemployed continue to be held in this area and are for the most part very orderly. Agitators, however, are working incessantly to foment discontent and my correspondents are of opinion that their teaching may have unfortunate results.An instance of communist work among the unemployed is given in the following report which was&apos; furnished by . a Barrow extremist, to Harry Webb:&quot;We/
&quot;We have up to last week been merely a propaganda body focussing attention on the unemployment crisis.   We have now got past that stage of tilling the soil and sowing the seed, and are preparing to reap the harvest.&quot;We have in Barrow ahout 0,000 unemployed: live register figures are up to November 6th 7,530, on relief work about 400 working 1 in 3 weeks and those who are working are on short time.   We have complete control of the unemployed committee.   We have 500 members on the books at present but we are waiting for cards coming through, and that number.will be doubled .every week until wo rope in the vast majority of unemployed.&quot;We have certainly demonstrated to the local authorities that we are a force to be reckoned with. We have the use of the Town Hall 1 day a week, also . the use of the Palace Theatre when we require it, also representation on local Council Unemployment   Committee also Labour Exchange and Committee for distribution of Coke, and a good number of Shopkeepers are selling goods to unemployed members at reduced prices from hfo to 10$.   We deal with hundreds of cases every day, and hand them on to the Board of Guardians (Labour Majority) with the result they have to sit-on some occasions till 2 in the morning.     (The Council and Board of Ouax*guardians are at their wits end at the growing ; menace of unemployment.   We are making ourselves a general pest to those in power, with the result it Is growing on the people that we are the only people with a policy.   &apos;&quot;We are demanding that every man shall have a card and look upon those who refuse as blacklegs, we are also arranging a conference of Workers and Workless with a view to forming a Council of Workers and get a common policy for all, and make them all live wires. In a nut shell we look upon the Crisis as a large oow giving a good bucket of milk and we are going to skim the cream off for the CP, and Proletarian leadership. We have plans drawn up for linking up with the whole district from Carlisle to Carnforth, ooTering Shipbuilding, Engineering, Mining (coal and iron) and smaller.industries producing all kinds of commodities from Food down to lead pencils, and a large Agricultural Area comprising small farmers and workers, so you see we have a job to-find a basis, so we are using the Unemployment Exchanges as a levelling out process pointing out they all got the same dole and they all want bread.   We are trying to arrange for a propagandist for about six weeks in the: districtIn Durham and Northumberland the unemployed aroreported to be quiescent:   depression is general in themining areas and the Northumberland Miners&apos; association has issued a circular stating.that the Executive Committeehas decided to discontinue the unemployment levy owing tothe/
the prevalence of short time.   The majority of miners affected by this decision will be able to draw unemployment benefit and relief from the Guardians.   Ey-Service men in Gateshead are endeavouring to organise a group to oppose the communists who have obtained control of the unemployed... On November 22nd about 1,000 unemployed attended a meeting at Hudder3field and afterwards Etarohed to the Guardians&apos; offices:   an annou cement that only two of their number would be admitted seemed likely to result in the crowd rushing the building, but the Guardians eventually consented to receive the whole Committee, which appears -to have joined forces with the National Administrative Council of Unemployed,    There are about 13,232 registered unemployed in Ruddersfield, 19s442 in Bradford, 24,000 in Leeds, 12,921 in Attercliffe and 30,135 in Sheffield:   most of these figures represent an increase on the preceding weeks.My Midlands correspondents report   increased distress and state that discontent is accentuated by the fact that retailers are, in many cases, maintaining their high prices.   Trouble is said to be brewing among the Leicester unemployed because of the reduced rate of wages paid to the men on relief work.   The.Nottingham Unemployed Committee is practioally defunct owing partly to neglect of work by the secretary and it seems likely that the communist Earry Pling will start a new committee.   On November 17th a new extremist unemployed committee was 3et -up in Leicester which appears to be controlled by the Communist Party,John MacLean&apos;3 lieutenants In Glasgow are devotingtheir/
w*  4r ***their attention to the rent question and are attempting to form &quot;eviction committees.&quot;In Falklrk tho extremists are urging their followe:rcg to refuse the authorised rates of relief and to demand scales which would place them in a better position than that of men who are working, the underling intention being to dislocate the machinery of local government.THE OOmiTOISTSWith optimism scarcely justified by the result of the appeal on behalf of the communist Russian Famine Fund, the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; announces that the workers of the world will shortly be called upon to loan to their Russian comrades 100,000,000 dollars:   5s0 shares guaranteed by the Soviet Republic will be issued. &quot;The Communist&quot; considers that &quot;the securitj&apos;- is good enough for most of us&quot; and that the appeal &quot;is likely to fire the imagination of workers in every landB&quot;   It is worthy of note, in this connection, that tho Famine Relief Committee in Berlin claims to have raised S100,000, for the Famine area:   of this sum the Communist Party of I Great Britain has raised  2,700.   Edgar Whitehead has approached the Irish Commmiist Party, to which he has sen a letter on behalf of Mu^isenberg, the secretary of the International Committee, appealing for money for tho Famine Fund.The financial statement of the Scottish Divisional organiser, to which reference was made in report No. 131 has elicited from Tom Bell, the national organiser, a reply which throws light on the present financial positjjff of the Communist Party:&quot;I have taken special notice of your expenditure sheet which is a matter for serious consideration.   I observe, of course, that some of the items will not recur again, but the items ofoommittoesf
committees and divisions, tolegrama and postages are really very serious.   In reality these are items that should be met by the division, were it anything like an active organisation, and those are the two items which I would especially direct your attention to with a view to curtailment.   In.practice, we are moving towards a position when divisions must attempt to bo self-supporting apart from actual wages.   This is the goal to which you muat try and get them to turn their attention.&quot;I have to say that the financial situation is becoming a serious one, and it would be as well for you to tackle that side as effectively as you can.&quot;With regard to the question of Newbo^s expenses I have referred this matter to Inkpin, and he is attending to it.&quot;Illuminating comments on the financial transactions ofthe Party have also been made by Eden Paul, who appearsto have some disagreement with Willis, of the PublicationsDepartment, regarding his payment for translations.Enclosing a new version of &quot;The International&quot;, which he suggests Willis should have sung to him, he writes:&quot;For big jobs, like Bucharin, etc., we are paid big sums, but  100 for 3 or 4 months&apos; work -and with proof corrections, research, index, etc., the Buoharih has been nearly four months1 work for 2 people - is Just the same as so much a week -except that: one has in most oases to give the other party credit Instead of receiving one&apos;a money every week like other wage earners*   We do plenty of unpaid work; but these main items are our only source of livelihood.    We oannQt be bothered by uncertainty aa to payment, or by the exceedingly distasteful task of having to play the part of duns., and if the Communist Party (for which, because it is the Communist Party we are quoting lower prices than we can command elsewhere) oan&apos;t settle its accounts promptly, the position becomes impossible.&quot;I don&apos;t want to advise you as to the running of your own department.   You are fully competent, and unasked advice is impertinent.   But, as a member df the Communist Party, and also as one of some experience in publishing matters, I have a right to criticism on the relationship between your dept. and the Party Treasury.   I&apos;ra quite certain that the publishing dept. can&apos;t be carried on successfully without a special fund of its own, quite independent of the vicissitudes of Party finance generally. The present arrangement is unfair to yourself, and no less unfair to all who have to work for the publishing department,&quot;Yet further light is thrown on the financial position by the party by Willie Gallaoher, who has informed J.R, Campbell that:&quot;So/
&quot;So far as Klrkwood *s debt is concerned thero has been no progress since I wrote you last.    We must continue to llvo on *hop* * Rather a questionable diet, but its about the only thing that&apos;s going around Just flow.     The Party will acoept responsibility for the  18, but it is not in a position to pay it out in bulk.   As a matter of fact we*re 1fce nearest thing possible to being &quot;broke.wWe can, however, starting from Saturday, pay three pounds per week for six weeks and you may absolutely rely on this being done.&quot;The Executive Committee intends shortly to devote &amp; special meeting to those theses drawn up for the most part in Mosoow, to which Uie leaders of the Party attach such importance and it is probable that these will soon be published in pamphlet or book torn;   the rank and file, however, have hitherto paid practically no attention to these documents.    The Executive will also consider this week the industrial policy and it is reportea that in Lond on a working agreement has been reached between Cant ana Pollitt:   i&amp;e latter has been speaking in the provinces, chiefly at branch meetings of the engineering and allied trades, but has admitted that little headway has been made.   In London communist, officials; are devoting special attention to the trade unions: instructions, signed by Hawkins, have been issued by the London and Home Counties Divisional Council &quot;that oommunist members are to oppose any instructions emanating from their executive and district trade union councils and that they ar&amp; to agitate on all occasions for unofficial strikes. The communists are said to have a majority on the London District Committee of the Amalgamated \Engineering Union.About/
About 15 :communists v$r$ present at a meeting, heliS under the ouspices of the League of Nations Union in Chelsea Town Hall on November 17th:    they were allowed to ask questions and no disorder ocourred, although they sang tho &quot;Red Flag&quot; at the conclusion of the meeting. *The libel case brought by Mr. J.H, Thomas, M.P., against MacManus, Meynoll and Howard in connection with articles and cartoons, which appeared in &quot;The Communist&quot; during the minors strike, is expected to be heard shortly:    the two last named will be represented by counsel but MacManus intends to defend himself.Interesting information has been received which indicates that communists in France and. Germany have an underground chain of comiriunication with British communists in which &quot;L*Humanite&quot; and George Slocombe, Paris correspondent of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, are links.The differences between communist branches in the North Eastern area have become so acute that Arthur MacManus is to investigate the matter personally:   the Divisional Council has accordingly been postponed until such time as ,he and Harry Webb can attend it.As a result of a breakaway from the British Empire Union an anti-communist union has been formed in Liverpool:    the committee, which is compose largely of workers, is taking an interest in the unemployed in opposition to the Communist Party and has found work for 53 men during tha last three weeks.     It is intended, if the union grows, to organise heckling at all communist meetings. AT.J. Waking is holding a series of speakers&apos; classes in South Wales and lectures weekly in Caerphilly,Newport/
Newport, Aberdare and Forth:    the maximum attendance at any one class lias, so far, been 25 and Watklns Is complaining that ho has no money to oarry en.COMMUNISM IN THE UNIV3R3ITIBSThere are signs that efforts are being made to organise oommunist groups at Oxford and O-siibridge and possibly at other universities.   The leaders are Arthur E.E. Reade, formerly managing editor of the &quot;New Oxford&quot; and now managing editor of the &quot;Free Oxford&quot;, Charles H* Gray, of Balliol College, assistant edlcor of &quot;Free Oxford&quot; ana M.H. Dohb, of St. John8s, Cambridge,The &quot;Free Oxford&quot; was started as title result of a breakaway from the moderate labour section in Oxford University which runs the &quot;New Oxford&quot;.Reads has recently written to Arthur Nott, the chairman of the Young Oommunist International of Great Britain?&quot;My Associate Editor, Charles H. Gray, of Balliol College, Oxford, who is also secretary jf the University Socialist Federation and Vice-president of the 0:%ford Univ: Socialist Society, writes to tell me that a group of the Young Communist League is being formed there as at Cambridge.   I have also heard from Dobb, who was going over to Oxford to-day about the matter. He writes: &quot;*&quot;*I think it essential for the University groups to be secret.&quot;I have written to ask his reasons as I do not agree with thls.&quot;*..&quot;The Socialist Societies already amount to Communist Societies, so I can&apos;t quite understand what is to be gained by the polioy of secrecy.     Of course I will abide by any decision, but (before I had heard about this)   I urged in my Editorial Notes&apos;in the issue of ,The Free Oxford&apos; now in the Press, that Univ. Socialist Societies should go over to the Communist Parties, (I did not mention the f Young Communist League) and expel recalcitrantmembers.&quot;Gray writes to suggest *The Free \Oxford 1 might be offered as the University organ of the Young Communist League.     This matter is. the main purpose of my letter.   You may have heard thatthe/
the proof of our number (dated Oct. 22, nominally out this week) were sabotaged by our local printers in Oxford, who not only cut out passages wholesale, but put in occasional ridiculous phrases of their own.   I wired to the Editor of &apos;The Communist&apos;, who very kindly arranged that the Benbow Printing Co. would print the issue for us (1,500 oopies - 16 pages  25).   I had to put everything in the hands of Gray, who was. on the spot in Oxford, and I gather that he either by entreaty or persuasion induced the Oxford printers to print the paper properly in its full and original form without any censorship.   So that there should be no further delay it was best that they should carry on for this number, but I think arrangements are being made with the Benbow Printing Co * for the future.&quot;We are shortly changing the name of &quot;The Free Oxford1 to &quot;The Hew University&apos; as it i:s essentially not an Oxford paper but an inter-University organ, 100 copies of each issue t;o to henderson&apos;s *Bomb Shop1, 66, Charing Cross Road, W.C.2, (whose address we use as our London office); 240 to our London University Agent (S. Haden Guest, 1917 Club, 4, Gerrard Street, W.) and quantities varying from haK-a-dozon to four dozen, to the 12 or so provincial Universities which have societies affiliated to the Unit, Sooialist federation (c/o Labour Research Dept., 34, Eoeleston Square),   In addition there is a sale in the Reformers&apos; Bookshop, etc, , and we have subscribers all over the country.&quot;It is a particular score that the first and only inter-University Labour paper should be oomraunist.   Our object is to stir up a communist nucleus among the &quot;Varsity men, who will be going out as schoolmasters, scientific workers, literary men and professional and &quot;intellectual1 workers in general that they may take their place in the Revolutionary working class movement.   It has oeemed to us that the best means of carrying on propaganda to this end is to print a publioation containing the following features: *1.   Editorial Notes (3 pages an issue) containing (a) a fortnightly review from the point of view of &quot;Communist Youth&quot; of the British and International Political and Economic affairs in general, and (b) a statement of our attitude as to the strategy and tactical policy to be followed by the Left Wing in the University Labour Movement.2. Informatiw Industrial Notes, contributed from a correspondent in London (the propaganda secretary of the national Guilds League),3.     General controversial articles expressing all &quot;advanced&quot; points of view on Sociological questions;   Contributors include Edward Carpenter. Arthur Ponsonby and C.H. Norman,
4.   leading article giving our point of view in reply to such contributions.5,   Heviews of books of interest to Labour students.6.   Literary criticism, poetry and similar features.   This side of the paper, which is of the greatest importance and value In selling a University paper is under the (non-political) oontrol of an &quot;idealist communist - Alan. Porter, B.A. (joint editor of &quot;Oxford Poetry1, etc., etc.,) who is generally recognized as the most brilliant of the poets of the younger generation. Contributors include Louis Golding (author of &quot;Sorrow of War&quot;, forward from Babylon1, etc.) Both these two men write for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;s&quot; literary page.7.   News (from Left Wing correspondents) of the University and inter-University Labour movements,- in fact a sort of University version of &quot;The Plebs&quot; and &quot;The Labour Monthly1 combined.Dobb, Gray, myself (and I think Sconer also) are members of a U.S*F. Sub-committee fo&apos;rmed to consider the amalgamation Of &quot;The Free Oxford1 and &quot;The University. Socialist Federation Bulletin&quot;.The two publications cover much the same ground, except that our circulation is about three times as largo.   I am anxious that &quot;The Free Oxford1 as &quot;The New University&quot; should be in future published jointly by the U.S.F. and by the Labour Publishing Co., and I am in correspondence with Langdon-Davies to try and fix up a contract for the Labour Publishing Co. to take over the publication and business of the paper.   On this practically speaking depends the paper1s continuance.   The work of advertisement and circulation has become more than we who have the Editorship in our hands can really cooperate with.   Moreover, in addition to the University sale it is obvious that the Labour Publishing Co. is the best possible organisation for increasing our sale through the same medium-as &quot;The Labour Monthly1.The difficulty of proprietorsh p arises.   The Labour Publishing Co, is disinclined to take over the proprietorship Of a communist journal and anyhow this would have obvious disadvantages.   The U.S.F. having no money cannot do so.   If I remain proprietor I shall have to furnish the Labour Publishing Co. with suitable guarantees&quot;before they undertake publication.   With   the appearanco of this number, I have asked Gray to *&apos;send out an appeal to various people in order to try and raise  150 immediately to get over the deficit on our first number and have sufficient to carry on with for the moment and to secure pledges for further  150 &quot;Guarantee Fund&quot; to assure our continuance on a sound financial basis in the future.   I think we may get sufficient adverts. (We already have &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Guild Socialist&quot;, 1Plebs1 and one or two publishers advertising - and theCP.
CP. of G.B. Literature Dept. is taking % page for &apos;A.B.C, of Communism&apos; in our November 5 number) to pay our way, present costs being   about  30 an issue, we have nob yet done so, and I fear we may have to shut up shop if we do not get support.It is &quot;under these circumstances that I want to know what prospect there is of the Young Communist League taking over &quot;The. free Oxford3 (to be renamed &quot;The New University1 in the New Year) as the organ of Communist Youth in the Universities and among the intellectual workers, to be published jointly through the U.3.3F. (which will probably beoo e the University organisation for the Y.CCL. or in some other way go definitely, over to the Third International, as we are already a communist majority on the Executive Commit bee) and through the Labour Publishing Co. - as the most effective means of getting the circulation we require.&quot;Last week Charles Gray appealed to the Communist Party for assistance to keep the &quot;Free Oxford&quot; alive.B. Woolf is another Cambridge undergraduate, who is working in conjunction with Dobbj   he is a member of the Communist Party, and an official of the Young Communist League group in Cambridge;   he also appears to be an acquaintance of Postgate, the editor of &quot;The Oommunist&quot;.THE YOUNG COMMUNIST INTERNATIONALOfficials of the Young Communist League have addressed meetings during the week &quot;b&apos;at friers appear bo be some-hitch in regard to fondas   code letters are passing between the 3h%Iravsn i:i this country and a m&amp;r. named Hyman in BorIi&quot;a3 about whom enquiries are being made. From these it would appear that the British representative of the Third International is in possession of funds for tho movement but is loath to part with them:   Hyman is endeavouring to bring pressure to bear on him through the Communist Party,     Hyman has also approached an official, &quot;L&quot;, in Berlin and states that the latter &quot;is quite prepared to get the goods through hut I rather fancy he will only go to a certain point and no further,,&quot;There are. as yet, no indications that the League is making/
-&apos; 12 fmaklng much progress In Great Britain hut it is possiblethat it will absorb the Socialist Sunday Schools, whlehvyhave a certain hold.   In Southward, for Instance, the average attendance in the York Street School is 50 and the &quot;teacher&quot; states &quot;of course we are now a section ofthe Communist Youth Movement and are separated from the3Socialist Sunday School union, which is really run now by 1 a lot of labour fakers.&quot;RED ORGANISATION AMONG SEAMm   ..The efforts which are being made to &quot;break up tho National Sailors1 and Firemenrs Union have their root in a movement to which Moscow is at present paying particular attention:   Tom Mann, Bill Eaywocd of America, Tom Walsh of Australia, Tom Barker of South America, Otto Rieger of the Beutscher Schiffahrts Bund and James Quintog, the English representative of the Federated seamen Union of Australia are some of the chief tools.   The last named is at present in Germany, trying to induce the German revolutionary seamen who have broken away from the Amsterdam International to link up again ../ith the Transport Workers&apos; Union.   On November 11th Quinton reported that he 4 in Hamburg &quot;busy calling on English crews, emphasising the I necessity for co-operation with the local union while in port.   It is now the intention it the local men to build harbour committee machinery on which all organi sat ions * would be represented, including representation of foreign shipping in port.&quot;On November 5th Quinton sent from Berlin an account   ^3 of his sojourn in Moscow: the following extracts are taken from this document:&quot;It/
&quot;It is ho use dwelling on my unfortunate luck in England, Suffice it to say, that the Comintern absolutely refuses to recognise any but a united Communist Party from Australia.&quot;I was given every r. eco&amp;nition outside of delegates Comintern mandate of an affiliated organisation. i -.c .\&quot;It was candidly admitted to me that the case for ono side from Australia had been more thoroughly represented by efficient speakers,&quot;The Comintern recognise that any delay was absolutely no fault of mine, and I was turned over to the ProfIntern,&quot;I am now under official instructions from the International Bureau of the Red Trade Union International and. I must keep in constant touch with Moscow. &apos;-    &quot;&quot;Both Howie and Casey were instructed for work in Australiao     $200- were given to me as expenses to England and for work inVj-ermany for about two months.,. I am on that work npw,&quot;My work in England will.be for marine organI sation,&quot;I am instructed to make a request to the subsequent united Communist Party&apos; of Australia, for English credentialsj   This will be&apos; to assist the purely Communist propaganda inside the marine organisation.THE COAL MINERSReports from the principal coalfields indicate that discontent and distress are rife and that there is some feeling against the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. Agitators are endeavouring to exploit the situation, although hampered, in the case of the Workers&apos; Committees and of the Red International of Labour Unions, by lack of funds.   Interesting comment on the situation is made,, in the current issue of &quot;The Worker&quot; by A, Ritchie, the chairman of the Scottish Divisional Council of the Shop Stewards and Workers1 Committee^:&quot;Robert/
&quot;Robert Smillie has at last taken his place as President of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union.   The event is one of some considerable importance; for &quot;Bob&quot;, so the press announcements read, is Going to take a grip of things.   One would like to believe that that &quot;grip&quot; would be big enough and strong enough to lift the Union from its present position of bankruptcy - financial and moral - to oho of comparative soundness and strength.   Unfortunately the wish is father to the thought.   To begin with, &quot;Bob&quot; has not that physical fitness which the ta3k demands; his eyes are now troublinc him in addition to his other troubles.   It is now becoming increasingly apparent to his most ardent admirers that he is a spent force - the spirit is willing, but tho flesh is weak.    Smillie has come back, not to a long, lingering, last look at what was, up till recently, tho best organised body of labour in the country.   At least everything points that way;    all the irforelation coming in now from the various counties suggests the startling fact that the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain is on tho verge of collapse.   Put this hateful thing behind you if you will;   go on believing that somehoY/ or another it will pull through;   but &apos;facts are chiols that winna ding;,1&apos; and the facts are that the Federation is going from bad to worse.   Local unions are springing up in several counties;    branches are holding up contributions, more serious than either of these, however, is the case of the thousands of good men and true, who have stuck to the Union through thick and thin, ref us ping now absolutely to contribute another farthing.   Local branch officials are urged to practice the strictest economy  ind to send on to head offices all contributions immediately they are collected.   Tho money in almost overy case being required to keep things going from week to week.&quot;THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;On November 19th a conference of various trade union and labour organisations in the Midlands was held at the Digbeth Institute, Birmingham, in support of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; 5Back to a Penny- campaign.   The conference was the first of a proposed series and my correspondent reports that George Lansbury wasgiven a vociferous welcome and that the proceedings were marked with &quot;extraordinary enthusiasm.&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of November 32nd announced that the Civil Service Clerical Officers&apos; Association has decided to adopt the &quot;Stamp Scheme&quot;, already endorsed bythe/
