(Referenoe Cabinet 88:(3l) Conclusion 7,)The following Memorandum has been prepared by the Home Secretary for the Information of the Home Affairs Committee who have been requested by the Cabinet to advise the Government on the Criminal.-Law Amendment Bill - a Private Member&apos;s Bill which was before Parliament last Session.;  This Bill was introduced last Session as a Private Members Bill by the Bishop of London in the House of Lords.   In 1920 three Bills relating to sexual offences were referred to, a Joint Committee and that Committee evolved from the three Bills a single measure comprising suoh alterations in the law as seemed to them both desirable and necessary.   The Bishop of London&apos;s Bill, which was based on the recommendations of the Committee, contained only the less controversial provisions which the Home Office was prepared to.support.   The Bill passed the Lords with certain amendment?, -the. ohief of these being the addition of a Clause introduoed by the Lord Chancellor to repeal Section 5 of the Punishment of Inoost ^ot, 1908, whioh requires that all proceedings under that Act are to be held in camera.The Bill was strongly contested in the House of CoinmonB, and amendments were oarried;bpth in Committeo and on Report.   These Inoluded an amendment in Committee modifying the Clause which repeals Section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Aot by a provision that the Judge trying any particular case of alleged inoest should have power to direct it to be held in oamera^and an amendment oarried on Report Stage adding, a new Clause to make gross indeoetioy between fomales a criminal offence.   The Lords disagreed with these two amendments, and at that stage of the Session^ and in view of the pledge given by the Leader of the House that oohtentioas business should not be taken after 11 e&apos;look, it was not possible to consider the Lords&apos; amendments and the Bill had to be dropped.The Bill, however, has behind it a very large measure- of support, both from women&apos;s sooieties and from sooial reformers generally, and the Government will oertainly be pressed either to take up the measure themselves, or to give facilities for a Private Members Bill next Session.
.   &apos; taa of opinion that, an Bill ^on-the Hn9B &apos;?.ot-the&quot; Bishop of Londbri^a Bill of last Session is desirable, and that it would be expedient to introduoe the Bill as a Government [measure, --The subject is so important and ao oontentious that it oannot properly be dealt with by a Private Members Bill.   If the measure is left.to. a Private.Member It is not improbable that difficulties&apos; similar to those experienoed last Session will reour and the Government will be blamed if the Bill ia again ship-wreoked, , . &apos; &apos;   t     &apos; &quot; ul atrf qffi0ff*fjIt is impossible to hope to oarry;a Bill of this kind without considerable opposition, but the point wore very thoroughly threshed out in the course of discussion last-Session! and there should be no * serious difficulty in carrying a Government measure in the form of    &apos; last Session1s Bill .as it left the House of Commons,-with the omission of four provisions, via. (l) tho- new Clause as to indeoenoy between females; (2) an amendment to Clause 1 which was carried against the Government providing that a young person of the age of fifteen years consenting to an indecent assault should be guilty.of a misdemeanour j (3) amendments oarried. in Committee providing- that&apos; alien offenders shall be recommended for deportation.   Courts already have power to recommend suoh offenders for deportation and- there are obvious objections to depriving the Courts of disoretion by providing that they Shall       ;j recommend deportation as an automatic sequel to a conviotlonyand (4) the amendment to: Clause 6 referred;to above giving disoretion    &apos;t;&apos;;-: to a Judge to try oases of incest in oamera.   These four-provisions v &apos; should be omittei and the Bill- introduced in the form shewn in the oopy-; attaohed as amended: in: manuscript. :.&apos; Mo/vjor .&quot; :.x.r.-
