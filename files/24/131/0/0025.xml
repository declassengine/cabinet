REPARATIONS IN KIND FROM GERMANY.

Note by the President of the Board of Trade.

I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues, a Memorandum in which examination is made in some detail of the proposal put forward by the Minister of Health in C.P.3446 and C.P.2722, regarding Reparations in kind from Germany.

There are to my mind two main difficulties: -

(l) The decision as to the form which reparations shall take and the allocation of the work will call for a considerable staff.

The handling of the German reparation dyestuffs has given experience on a miniature scale of the complications which such a form of reparations entails.

(2) With the exception of potash and sugar - and the latter is doubtful - reparation will have to take the form of manufacturers goods. It will be most difficult to explain to manufacturers and workmen that those goods could not have been ordered at home.

These are two points which I submit should be most carefully examined by the Cabinet before any conclusion is come to in this latter.

REPARATION IN KIND PROM GERMANY.Nature and advantages of the Scheme,The proposal whioh has been put forward pro/vides for the supplying by Germany of capital goods which could not otherwise be acquired at the present time, in place of payment by Germany of certain sums in sterling.These gocds could not otherwise be acquired at the present time because the capital is lacking; but it is true that to the extent to which Germany paid reparation in sterling the capital would not necessarily be lacking.   So the contrasted methods of payment would seem at first to come to the same thing.   But this is not the case.   The two methods would work out quite differently and the new one has certain ebvlcus and substantial advantages.In the first plaoe we should diminish the competiticn of German goods with British both here and in Overseas markets. Under the system of money reparation Germany must get the money by exporting goods, which are bound to compete with our exports, and some displacement of labour, however temporary is therefore unavoidable.In the seoond place, while it is becoming increasingly doubtful hew far we can rely on receiving a substantial amount in money, there ought to be no insuperable difficulty in realizing a substantial amount if we are prepared to take reparation in kind.    The reason is that Germany&apos;s exports, from whioh her capacity to find money is derived, must bo limited by the oompe t i t i$n,;g  exports from other countries; and that difficulties connected with the exchanges (which difficulties if not actually&quot; engineered might at least be intentionally allowed by the German Government to remain) are boun4 to be a serious obstacle.   Reparations In kind, en the contrary, have not to fight for a market, and their flow is not directly or seriously impoded by the state of the exchanges., In the third place the setting up of the undertakings t* make use of the German capital goods, and the operation of these undertakings when completed would afford employment in this country and iji the overseas parts -of the Empire taking such goods.Prims.- facie, then, the new plan Is so attractive that it calls for the most careful examination.It is proposed to consider briefly (1) what would be the effect of the scheme on the German oxohangos, (2) what difficulties it presents from our point of view, and (3) what form the deliveries could best take.
(^ ) The effect on the exchanges,As deliveries of reparation in kind would not be much affected by the state of the German Exchanges, the question of what would be the effect of their adoption on the German exchanges is not a question of particular relevancy.   But it is of some importance to examine it, nevertheless, tc enable us to gauge the bearing of the new proposals on German interests and on the trade disturbances caused by collapsed exchange.The German exchange position would be strengthened if deliveries in kind were substituted for money paj/ments, and probably no damage would be done to the exchanges unless deliveries in kind largely exceeded, what money payments would have been made otherwise,   The reason for this may be briefly stated.Other things being equal, if the production of goods for reparation correspondingly diminished the quantity -available for commercial export, which Is highly improbable, the exchange position would be the same as at present: but if the diminution of export were less, which may be assumed, exchange difficulties would be reduced.Moreover, other things would not be equal.   On other grounds the exchange position would tend to Improve.   The violent fluctuations due to heavy and intermittent Government purchases on the Exchange Market would be avoided, exchange speculation would be less, and the greater confidence thereby induced would steady and strengthen the market and check the panic which has taken the form of &quot;the flight of the mark1.As to the temptation to inflate the currency in Germany, no disadvantage need be apprehended on this score.   However Germany paid she would have to find money, either to buy exchange or the goods to deliver.    If she paid in kind she would gain in not having to pay through a depreciated exchange c*nd her prospects of raising maney by taxation would improve as the disorganisation due to herhaving periodically to find large sums in foreign bills v&amp;s removed,(2) Difficulties from the British point of view.The chief objections to the scheme from our own point of view seem to be the following(a) We should ex hypothesi be obtaining goods and establishing undertakings in advance of the time when wo should have done so in the normal course.    ./e cannot be sure of making the best choice, and we shall have to be guided to some extent by political considerations.   Moreover it will probably be necessary in many cases to dispose cf the goods at something less than current prices,(b) It would be neoessary for the Government to arrange with the Dominion Governments, local authorities, companies or private individuals, for the g&amp;ods to be placed at their disposal on suitable terms,   Negotiations
and arrangements for this purpose would often be extremely complicated and difficult.   Neither will it be easy to arrange the terms if payment, whloh will have to involve giving long credit, being secured, say, by debentures redeemable in war loan at stated Intervals.(o) Again the scheme Involves the provision of capital for the enterprises set up beyond what is represented by the reparation goods.   Plant, machinery and equipment can be obtained from Germany for selected purposes but much of the work can only be done In the plaoe where the capital Is to be employed,(d) Another serious consideration is that if Bnpira users obtained (for example) elaborate machinery in this way from Germany, they would have the strongest induoement to go to the same makers for new parts or fresh plant.   3y giving German plant cheaply, the Government would.be creating good-will for tho German makers, which would have,, in the long run, an adverse effect on British makers pf similar commodities.It may however be possible in some cases tr stipulate that supplementary orders are not placed abroad unless a Government Authority is satisfied that they cannot be executed at home at a reasonable price and within a reasonable time.(e) Lastly there is the political difficulty.   It will not be easy to convince people that the Government is justified in taking deliveries of capital goods from Germany while there is serious unemployment here, - even though in fact the result is to increase employment.(3) Glass of Go,ods which might,be Scheduled for Delivery.The compilation of lists of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods to which the scheme could be applied, and the determination in each case of tho extent wf the demands which would be made from Germany in each case, without damage to the producing interests in this country, would be a complicated and difficult task.The best method of approach is perhaps to consider definite improvements in the fabric of British industry, and in the Industrial fabric of the Empire which are desirable in the near future, though unlikely to be carried out owing to the inadequacy of our resources, bearing in mind that there would be less tendency to resort to Germany for the replacement of some goods than of others.The selected schemes could no doubt be arranged in a suitable order ef priority according as it appeared to be more or less pressing to proceed with them, and. according as it was possible to obtain delivery of the necessary quantities of the various goods required for them from Germany without much difficulty.
The following list Is put forward tentatively as illustrating the kinds of plant which could possibly be acquired under the scheme:- .(a) Government Works in the United Kingdom and other parts of the EmpirecRailways in India,, the Dominions and Colonies.Electric CalOsfe for the post Office.Submarine Cables.,Yilreless stations,,Mooring Masts for airships.(b) Public Utility Works. Dredgers, Buoys,Cranes, Elevators&apos; and Dock Equipment. Constructional Steel and Cement. Lighting Stations for Aerial Navigation. Lenses and Mirrors for lighthouses. Floating Docks. High pressure gas mains.(c ) Works of National Advantage.Potash, Artificial - Nitrates and other Chemical Fertilisers.Electrical Equipment for Railways and Power Plant, Books for Libraries.Yearly deliveries of young trees for afforestation. Pipe Lines for transmission of Oil. Roadside petrol installations. Turbines for Severn Tidal Power Scheme. Train Ferries,Rolling Mills for Metal Work.Plant for combined coke, iron and steel works.Plant for supplying coke oven gas to town gas works,and for gas-traction. Heavy Boring Machinery for a Channel Tunnel.Railway development in British possessions could no doubt vlth advantage be made to absorb a very large amount of reparation goods.     It would be fairly simple to make satisfactory arrangements both with the Governments or Companies in the British Possessions concerned, and with the Geman Government for the delivery of most of the goods required.   &apos; Developments in this direction would not be ruled out on account of the volume of additional capital required or of any strong tendency to effect replacements In Germany, though it might not be easy to show that the new-railway developments undertaken with the reparation goods were additional to what would otherwise have been undertaken,&apos; Unfortunately/ in most cases British manufacturers and British labour would be suspicious that the Germans   were executing orders which might otherwise have given them work.In the case of Pipe Lines for transmission of oil, of Turbines for the Severn Tidal Power Scheme (when after further study that scheme was ripe for execution), of Boring Machinery for a Channel Tunnel (if and when that Scheme received sanction) and cf Train Ferries, it would be comparatively simple to make arrangements for the utilisation of the reparation goods, because there would be no question of distributing them among a large number of individuals.    ij-&apos;hese scheme are more or less self-contained and could either be put into execution by the Government or carried out by arrangement with private enterprise.
The difficulties of making suitable arrangements would no doubt be greater in the case-of articles needed for public utility works, on account of the number of authorities who would have to be considered, and of the greater difficulty of ensuring that the goods were not substituted for goods which would have been obtained from British manufacturers.potash, Artificial Nitrates, and other Chemical Fertilisers.could hardly be disposed of at all otherwise than by sale at low price and in these cases there would be difficulty in showing that the British manufacture of fertilisers was not detrimentally affected.In the oase of trees for afforestation the principal objection is that in any scheme of afforestation the main cost is labour.BOARD OP TRADE.
