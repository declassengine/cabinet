THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S ttOVTlRWAENT ..............SECRET.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ^                                CABINET. CP.3589. m,......_______REPORT BY THE GENERAL-OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF ON THE GENERAL SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WEEK ENDING 24TH DECEMBER,1921..(Circulated &quot;by the Sep.rec.cry of State for War).1.    GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.The military situation remains unchanged.   Drilling and training &quot;by I.R.A. units continues, and in a few districts where extremists have announced their intention of standing out for a Republic, the drilling has been intensified.    Sinn Fein Courts are believed to be still held, but the action of the police in dispersing these Courts has led to their being hold in secret.Rumsur says that had a vote on the Ratification of the Treaty been taken *n the Dail on Wednesday, there would have been a majority against ratification, and that it was because he knew this, that Michael Collins moved the adjournment to January 3rd.     It must be remembered that the election which returned the present members to the Dail was held with the express purpose of making the Act of 1920 inoperative and of showing contempt for the Government by selecting as candidates the most virulent extremists.     To attain this object the men elected were to a large extent chosen from those already interned or serving sentences for outrages.   Farther, about ninety per cent of the candidates were nominees of the I.R.A.     It is obvious that a great many of these men are likel7/ to retain their extreme views and to remain irreconcilable, but it is equally obvious that, owing their elections to the intimidation of a more moderate opinion which has now gained courage, they no longer represent the views of their constituents. The interval before January 3rd is likely to tell in favour of ratification, for extreme men of the Dail will, in the majorit:r of cases, find that their attitude towards the Treaty is not popular in the country. As a good many of them are members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, it will then become a question of the relative powers of persuasion between the Priests&apos; absolution for the breaking of an oath and the revolver&apos;s inducement to keep it.Meanwhile
G.H.Q.Irelana,28th December 1981.Meanwhile&apos; the public are beginning to be as apathetic, a&quot;.-, ore. the long drawn cut discussions in the Da11, as they were regarding th prolonged meetings of the London Conference.    The Press, throughout Ireland, however,  is conducting a strong campaign in favour of ratification.There have - been one cr two instances of policemen having been fired at, and it is generally believed that such cases result from desire cf certain released internees to get their own back.(Sgd.)
