should be added to the programme,       No definite docision was reached.It appears that Prance will claim the right at the Washington Conferonce to have a Naval strength equivalent to the 3rd Naval power and will vehemently oppose any attempt to abolish submarines.NETHERLANDS.The Dutch battleship &quot;PS ZEVSN PROYINCIEN&quot; is expected to remain at Portsmouth until 2 December for repairs, before continuing her cruise to the East Indies,ITALY.1. .   The Italian T.B. &quot;CiSNTAURO&quot; was driven ashore on the Anatolian coast near Adalia on 5th November whilst run-ning for shelter.     The possibility of salving her is reported to be doubtful.UNITED STATES.The heals of the two Fleet Submarines V 1 and Y 2 were laid at Portsmouth Navy Yard on the 20th. October last. It is understood that V 3 is also building.These three boats belong to a class of nine authox-ized by the 1916 programme.     The other six have not been started.V 1, 2 and 3 will have a cruising radius of 10,000miles.
PALESTINE.The two British representatives who have been conferring at Beirut with 1&apos;rench xepreoentatives on tho question of the Syrian-Palestine boundary have returned to Jerusalom as the Conference proved abortive.RUSSIA.&quot;White&quot; revolt in,Karelia.     The rising in Karelia is spreading.     Tt 1 a DeTTeWS^to^Ts organised by the German General von der Opltz and his satellites..     The Karelian Bolshevik Government has been removed from Petro-Zsvodsk to Potrograd.Risings in the Ukraine are reported to be gaining ground in spite of S6viet donials.,;7nrk has been resumed at the Petrograd Mint in connection with the coinage of money.

Socialists   66        &quot; Liberals       33        &quot;The Catholics gained nine seats.     The success of the Catholics and the failure of.the Liberals were equally unexpected.ALBANIA.Pending the definite delimitation of the frontier by the Boundary Commission, the Goxa.tc.il of Ambassadors has decided that the only way to avoid disputes and collision between Jugoslavs and Albanians is to establish a temporary neutral zone.     Such a zone has been fixed, and its extent communicated to the Jugoslav and Albanian Governments, with the request that they will withdraw their troops from it before   10th December.A request by the Albanian Government to bo allowed to retain a force of gendarmerie in this neutral zone has been disallowed.ITALY.The Italian Government have stated that negetia-tions between Signor Tuozzi and Mustapha Kernel have complete]
broken down, as Komal insists on a similar treaty to that with France being signed before he will consider a setttle-ment of outstanding questions connected with Adalia. It is therefore probable that Signor Tuozzi will shortly leave Angora.

The Allies have requested tho Rumanian Government to contribute 100,000 gold francs annually towards the main-tenance of ex-Emperor Karl of Hungary.

The evacuation of Groek and Armenian refugoos from Cilicia has commenced, and large numbers are reported to be anxious to escape from the country before the departure of the French. Greek transports are being employed for tho pur-pose, but difficulty is being experienced in finding places to disembark them. One thousand have been taken to Smyrna, but the Greek Governor there has proclaimed his inability to receive more.

There are about 150 British subjects in tho neigh-bourhood of Adana. The French Government has been informed that H.M. Government relies on all possible French protection being afforded them, but has replied that protection cannot be given.A British destroyer is accordingly being sent to Mersina.
