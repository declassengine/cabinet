No special sum is&apos; set aside for new construction, but the Dockyard Vote totals over Kr: 10,000,000.P 0 R T U G A L.,The internal affairs of Portugal are still in a very precarious condition owinrr to the disaffection of the Navy and the activities of certain Bolshevik elements.
The steamer reported in&apos;7.I.S. No.44 of 5th Novenibe as being captured by the Greeks laden with fuel supplies for the Turkish Army is riow stated by the $reek Press, to be the Turkish S*S. &quot;Fetiye&quot;.   She was flying the Jugoslav flag when taken.UNITED ... STATES.The U-So Battleship &amp;&apos;7est Virginia&quot; was launohed -on 19th November.     All the battleships of the nj&amp;tryland&quot; olass are now afloat.J A PA N.Evidence is accumulating that the Japanese will be forced to restrict their shipbuilding programme on account of financial considerations.   It is probable that the American proposals with certain modifications are very acceptable on this account.   The Japanese press, is in ficeneral favour of the American proposals, but exception is taken to so rapping the &quot;Mutsu&quot; which is almost due for oonnissioning.
&quot;TAUT   11*    GENERAL   INTELL IGENQ IVR U S 5 1j.Id I- o rnal 0 pndit i ons *   A rising on a large soale against tfte&apos;^c?/iei. government has &quot;broken out in &quot;Karelia and it is &quot;believed that the whole district between Finnish frontier and the &apos;7hite Sea (from 64 to 66 parallels) is in revoltePOLAND.The Diet decided after a stormy debate by a small majority to inolude the Lida and Braolaw districts in the Vilna plebisoiteo   Mardial Pilsu&amp;ski threatened to resign unless the Diet consented to this measureoARABIA,&quot;King Hus s el n la. as o rde red twenty aeroplanes from an Italian firm in ISgypt.additionalBULGARIA.A Nationalist emissary named Fuad is organising a campaign of sabotage against the Greek Government in Thrace,,   He is added in this by the fact that the bulk of the Bulgars and the Turks in Northern Thrace favour the Nationalist causes   On the 25th October a tunnel east of Buk Railway bridge was destroyedv and on 2nd November, a bridge at Emir-lee (S. of Adri&amp;nople) was blown up.

Orders for the demobilisation of all Jugoslav reservists called up for operations against Hungary were isstied on the ni$it of 12th November.   It is expected that demobilisation will be completed in about 10 days a   These orders do not, however, affect reservists who were drafted to unit3 on the Albanian frontier.TURKEY.The military situation is quiet, but there are indioa-tions that the Nationalists intend to launch an attack in strength against the Greeks from the direction of Afium Kara--Hissar.It is reported that Signor Tuozsi5 s negotiations at Angora, conoerning recent happenings at Adalia, are not pro-ceedingwell.   His stay is likely to be prolonged, more especially as the Italian Government wishes him to ascertain and report on the general attitude of the Xemalist Government.
