This Document isGERMANY&apos;capacity   TO   PAY.Notes by Sir^John Bradbury.British Delegation,Reparation Commiss ion,13.1 Avenue des Champs-ElyseesParis7th November,1921.My dear Chancellor,MAT CAN GERMANY PAYDURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?In reply to the request for my personal views as to Germany&apos;s capacity to pay reparation during the next five years,  I send you the following notes.     They arc I fear rather faague but any picture dram under existing con-ditions must necessarily belong to the impressionist school.pay has hitherto been discussed mainly from the economic and industrial stand-points.     What current surplus of exports over imports Is Germany capable of creating?    How rapidly can such a surplus be created?     To what extent can future surpluses be discounted by the raising of immediate foreign credits?experts&quot; last February I subscribed to the view that the annual payments envisaged by the previous Inter-allied Agreement of Paris were net demonstrably in excess of G ermany&apos;s economIc c ap a c i ty.of a negative estimate,  I should have been disposed to say that, given financial and industrial order in Germany, thatThe question of Germany&apos;capacity toIn the second report of the &quot;BrusselsIf I had had to make a positive insteadcountry
country would have been In a position to create an almost Immediate surplus of exports of not less then 2 milliard gold marks per annum to be increased gradually to 3 and probably to 4 within 10 years - the measure of the increase being the degree to which the customary standard of comfort of the population could be depressed without giving rise to social disorder.This estimate, which is of course highly conjectural, is not the result of any precise calculation but is based on a general appreciation of the pre-war dimensions of German foreign trade, the world rise in gold prices, the industrial power liberated by the reduction of German naval and military expenditure and the depression which has already taken place in the standard of comfort, subject to allowances for diminution of territory and for the prejudice which is suffered by Germany In foreign markets as the result of recent history.The only alterations in the fundamental economic situation during the last nine months are the partial loss of Upper Silesia to Germany and the growth of a disposition on the part of the Allies - more particularly on the part of Prance - to accept a larger part of their shares of reparation in the form of commodities.As regards Upper Silesia my own view is that the proposed economic arrangements are likely to give rise to so much friction that the economic damage to Germany may be as great as or even greater than if the whole 0f the indue trial area had gone to Poland.
How far the growing disposition to receive deliveries in kind will lead to actual absorption of German goods on a large scale is still problematical.     In so far as it does, it will tend to compensate for tho prejudice in foreign markets referred to above.It is however important to bear in mind that whether reparation is paid in cash or in kind the fundamental problem of the creation of a surplus of exports is not affected.     Payment in kind merely facilitates the disposal of the surplus when created, and, although this is a very important consideration, I should not myself put the additional amount which could be got by accepting goods instead of money at more than 2 5 per cent of the value of the goods so accepted.I am, however, still disposed to regard 2 milliards rising to 3 and possibly y,o 4 within 10 years as economically possible, though it would probably he necessary at any rate in the earlier years that not less than bbf.-should be accepted in the form of commodities.These estimates are of course estimates of annual capacity.     Once this capacity is established and the world-credit-creating machinery reestablished - two very large assumptions - it would be possible in any given year to capitalize a portion, and In a series of year3 to capitalize the greater part, of this annual capacity.     I lelieve, however, that the actual chances of doing this on a large scale within the next five years are remote.Yilhile, however, the fundamental economics situation
situation remains substantially what it was nine months ago, tho catastrophic developments of the monetary arid financial conditions of Germany now dominate the immediate future.. The depreciation of the mark is reaching a point when either It must be checked or there will be a complete breakdown of the financial structure.I have heard it suggested that Germany can continue to live and even prosper with her foreign exchanges in the condition of those Of Austria and Poland.     But these countries have been kept In existence only by a kind of international out-door relief.     The supply of their essential needs in this manner has enabled their currencies to retain some international value, however insignificant. In the case of Germany it is doubtful whether the scale of the problem would allow, or the temper of other nations would permit, her essential needs to be so supplied, and there is serious risk that the next development will be not a gradual depreciation from 1000 to the   to 10.000 and then to 20.000, but an impossibility of selling marks at any price.The only method by which the depreciation of the mark can be checked Is the stoppage of the printing press and the only conditions under which the printing press can be stopped are that the German Government should meet its expenditure out of revenue or the proceeds of real loans.The Budget shewed some promise of a equilibrium apart from reparation charges before the recentfall
fall In tho mark, but oven this promise has been falsified by the increases of salaries which the rise in domestic prices following that fall has rendered inevitable.In the face of the Budget situation result-ing from the reparation charges, the credit basis for a voluntary internal loan does not exist, and the prospects of repayment of a compulsory loan would be so remote as to make such a loan in substance a capital levy.In any case the existing Government is probably not strong enough to carry through either a compulsory loan or a capital levy on the necessary scale and any Government which would be strong enough, would almost certainly have different views as to the attitude to be adopted to the reparation liability^My conclusion is that large cash payments for reparation in the near future would make any real step towards the restoration of budget equilibrium (which will in any case be a matter of extreme difficulty)  impossible and that if effective steps are not taken towards such restoration without further delay, a general financial debacle cannot be avoided.I think the wisest way of handling the situation would.be to encourage the German Government to ask for a partial moratorium in regard to reparation payments for the purpose of enabling them to stabilise the budget and currency situations.The moratorium, If granted, should be provisional only,  i.e., it should be subject to suspensionif
if at any time the Reparation Commission was not satisfied with the progress which was being made towards stabilisation, and the grant of it should be cbhditional on&apos; the Reichsbank being made independent of the Government and accepting an adviser of neutral nationality to be nominated by the Reparation Commission, whose duty it would be to see that any loans made to the Government were made on proper banking principles.While I do not believe it would be possible under existing conditions to prohibit &quot;ways and means&quot; advances altogether, all such advances ought to be . conditional on satisfactory steps being taken, at the time the advances are made, to provide for their repayment.Such an arrangement might lead to the Internal bankruptcy of the German Government and if it did it would of course break down, but the consequences of a breakdown in such circumstances would be so serious for all substnatial financial interests in Germany that once the arrangement was established there would be considerable pressure in Germany itself to maintain it.At any rate I think it is the best chance and I would be disposed to give liberal moratorium terms to secure it.     What those terms should be v. ould require considerable discussion.     I should be disposed to Insist on the maintenance of the annex deliveries on the scale at present contemplated and in addition on a limited annual supply, both to Prance and other countries, of commodities
commodities for the reconstruction of devastated areas of the kind contemplated by the Loucheur-Rathenau Agreement and on a levy on all Greman exports into Allied countries, to be collected by these countries themselves on the lines of our Reparation Recovery Act; - any amount by which the total of these cources of payment fell short of a prescribed sum (say 1 milliard or possibly 1&amp; milliards) to be made up in foreign currencies.The moratorium might in the first instance (subject of course to the right of suspension) be for a period of 2 years with the possibility 6f extension for a farther 2 years if at the end of the first period the Reparation Commission were satisfied as to the progress made and of the necessity for extension.The arrears during the moratorium might be capitalised and a 30 year terminable annuity to discharge them added to the fixed annuity of 2 milliards as from the end of the moratorium.If some such arrangement could be arrived at I should not despair of getting the milliard a year during the moratorium period and the full annuity afterwards, with hope of capitalising a good part of the latter at no very distant date.If the hope of a resettlement of the Variable annuity and the possibility of some mitigation of the burden of it could also be held out, I should beevenI
even sangMne of the success of the plan.What is psychologically most important is to give the German people a glimpse of daylight at the end of the tunnel.     This will establish the conditions necessary for the raising of real internal loans without which the salvation of tho currency is almost impractical.If this is a correct diagnosis of the situation it follows that my answer to the questions put in Sir Basil Blackett!s letters cannot be categorical.If an attempt is made to extract as much as possible of each instalment cf the Schedule of Payments annuity as it becomes due, I think we might get between 1.-1&apos; and 2 milliards in the calendar year 1922 without military pressure and that the result would be that we should get very little afterwards.Military pressure would in my opinion be quite unremunerative.If we are content with 1 milliard (or perhaps a little more) per annum for 2 to 5 years we have a reasonable chance of getting 5 rising to 4 afterwards. The length of the moratorium would probably have to be varied, inversely to the generosity of its terms.If political considerations would allow terms, &quot;which would enable Germany to reestablish her internal public credit the period might be as short as 2 years as regards the probable date of the german v and &apos;?. milliards In tiro cuxlehvtar voar It-;v:l Urdefault8.
default, I shall be in a better position to prophecy after our visit to Berlin.     We start to-morrow.So far as I can judge at the moment neither the payment due on the 15th January nob that due on the 15th February can be met without the raising of considerable foreign credits - probably not less than 250.000.000 gold marks for the January and a further 150 .000,000 for the February payment -   either by a straight German Government loan or by the pledging by German industrials of the proceeds of future exports.The former expedient probably means releasing some of the best of the German assets from the reparation priority   -    the latter the anticipation of resources required for future instalments, and prqbably fiscal concessions to the industrials whose help is sought, which will make the task of restoring budget equilibrium even more hopeless than it is at present.The necessary credits for the January and February payments will probably be forthcoming if we, are prepared to pay the price   -    tliough even this is not. certain.     At an even stiffer price it might be possible to cover the instalments up to May or even up to August, But every instalment so met increases the future difficulties and. it would be a miracle if tho breakdown -were staved off over tho autumn.I think the probabilities are that theFrench
French will not agree to the concessions necessary to secure even the first credits and we may have the crisis upon us by the 15th January,The policy of -the Belgians is now, at all costs, to secure the   payment of the instalments necessary to provide the balance of their priority whatever may happen afterwards.I am a little afraid that this considers tion will make them somewhat less desirous than they otherwise might be of an. immediate settlement on a reasonable basis, but on the whole they are very good and very helpful.I propose therefore to continue to co-oper*ate with them   -   more particularly in view of the importance from a political point of view of postponing the crisis   -    in supporting any tolerable plan for interim credits.There is the further complication of the current charges for Armies of Occupation.       This is not material for the next month or two as the bills will not be ready for presentation until after the report of the Committee which is now cutting has been received and been considered, but it will become an Important element in the course of 1922.If the moratorium plan is adopted, theannual
aonnual-yBmoTttr^^ ought to be inclusive of the Army Claim.     I do not think it should bo higher than 1-1 milliards and I should prefer 1^-.Yours sincerely,The Right Hon. Sir Robert S. Home, G.B..E.      X.c..    1&quot;:.P.
British DelegationReparation Commission, 131, Avenue des Champs-Elysees, PARIS. 7th November, 1921.My dear Chancellor,Since I drafted, the accompanying letter we have received from Finlayeon (the British member of our Intelligence Service at Berlin), a letter from which I enclose extracts shewing how the situation in relation to the industrial credit is developing.The press accounts this morning also tend to confirm my view that the industrials will -want a pretty high price for their co-operation (see copy of cutting from Paris &quot;Daily Mail&quot; herewith).I also enclose a copy of a memorandum by Kemball Cook analysing the Report of the Committee of Guarantees and explaining the various cross currents within that body.Yours sincerely,(Sd .)      JOHN BRADBURY,The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Treasury, London.
F.49C CONFIDENT 1AL.Extract from letter from Mr, Finlayson to Mr. Kemball Cook, dated. 4fch November, 1921.Ha.guer.in, the French Member cf the Information Service at Perl in, came in tc see me again this morning and especially to ask me to impress upon my Delegation the seri-ousness of the moment.,   Haguenin has been -very active lately and has seen no end of officials. bankers, journalists and public men and his views are very pessimistic,   He has not hesitated to state his views in his &quot;private correspondence with pubcis, and they are those:-It seems pretty certain that the Reichstag will adjourn after the end of next week for a pretty long time and that the hopes of passing the lax Bills are very slight. It seems equally certain that the efforts to obtain foreign credits upon the guarantee of German Industry are practically nil.     Inchese circumstances it would appear both to Haguenin and myself that C.6.letter of the 2nd November to Wirth did not attack the real kernel of the problem.   A promise made by \7irth does not amount to anything.     True, he has an abun-dance of bonne volunte   but he has no backing and is utterly powerless.     On the one hand he has tried to struggle against the great producing interests, the Industrialists, the Bankers and the Farmers and,  on the other hand,  as Head of a very weak Government, he is opposed by Parties whose principles and interests are entirely against him.     Even the Socialists are unable to afford him much help and they are sure to vote against his indirect Tax schemes, while the Centre Party cannot accept the new Z&apos;.c.-cr:  .    the &quot;Goldwerte&quot;.
The extraordinary fall In the German mark has completely altered the whole situation.) the midday Bourse quotation being 900 marks to tho pound.In short, the danger of a break-up is extraordinarily near and it is up to the Committee, I think, to devise some new way out .. ,..   Is not the idea of a general   moratorium perhaps the best thing&apos;?     I noticed in today&apos;s paper that the Junior Partner of Marshall Fields proposed that the ultimatum should be hold up for a period of five to fifteen years.     Could we not keep the &apos;Schedule of Payments as a symbol, thereby saving everybody&apos;s face and hold up its execution for some period to be arranged by the Powers?     It would of course be a good thing for the offer to come from a creditor.One last point about German politics.   It appears to me that the only hope of finding a stable Government in Ger-many is to bring in the Volks Partei.   This, however, does not fall in with French ideas, which support a Government of. the Majority Socialists and the independent Socialists.   This would be another fatal step as the direct result of this would certainly be to throw the Volks Partei further right into the arms of the Deutsche Nationals.   F daresay that these and similar problems are occupying the minds of both Bradbury and yourself, but it is just as well to know how we who live in Berlin envisage the situation.
Loans for reparations in reuurn for railwaycontrol,]?roni Our Own Correspondent.Berlin,Sunday.The thousand richest men of Germany, members of the Union of Gentian Industry, met yesterday in a marble hall of a Berlin hotel to discuss the question of affording their Government financial help by placing at its disposal credits abroad.After many hours of discussion, they decided to do so, but only on conditions which deppive their offer to help their country of any value .     They passed a resolution em-powering a committee to enter into negotiations with the Government with a view to affording it pecuniary help for paying reparations.     As a condition cf help,  they demand a guarantee that the Government and the Teichstag exercise strict economy in every department of the State, and free the economic life of the country from every bond which hinders its development - in other words, the eight-hour day and other ameliorations made by law in the life of the worknen iuust go by the Board.They also require that enterprises in the hands of the State and public bodies must be managed in such a way that they will no longer involve a loss of public finances.     This phrase covers the favourite scheme of T-Terr Stinnes,  the industrial magnate, of getting the control of the State railways of Germany, which are being worked at a loss.
BRITISH E3L3GAT I01T.The Committee of Guarantees have now decided upon the final form of their report to the Reparation Commission on the subject of their recent visit to Berlin,The following short summary of the Report is submitted together with a few personal remarks, in continuation of my Minute of the 15th October.The Report begins by pointing out the startling change in the position of affairs, due to the fall in the mark, which had occurred since their visit to Berlin in June.     The following is a brief resume of the figures as they appeared in June and in September respectively:-The situation in June presented itself as follows:-15th InTqyember PaymentSum due  ...........................     325 million gAgainst which were estimated:-Value of deliveries in Kind (6 months at ICO millions .per month)600Reparation (Recovery Act) (6 months - 150 275Balance350675675

Deliveries in Kind.2 x 500.. .83 .42.   Reparation (Racpvery) Act 12Deficit..........    ..    ..40S.3500 500 million gem.
That is to say, that between now and the 15th January, the German,Government must procure in foreign bills the equiva-lent of 403.3 million gold marks, or, at the rate of 30:1, 12,250 million paper marks.The Committee proceed to detail the course of their negotiations with the German Government, as to which you were Informed in Mr. Leith Ross&apos; note of the 9th October, and my Minute of the 15th October.   The net result of these negotia-tiona may be summarised as followsThe German Government undertook to pay into a special account to be opened in the name of the Committee in the Reich-sbank the Customs duties (both Import and Export) with, effect from the 15th October.   These they would, replace by Foreign Bills before the 15th November.     They would also pay into the same account the paper mark equivalent of the 25% levy, (15th Oct. - 15th Nov.) and would make every effort to convert that sum by the 1st December.The Chancellor at the same time gave a formal engagement that any sums obtained as a result of his negotiations with the Industrials etc, would be devoted primarily to Reparation pur-poses .On this understanding the Committee left Berlin after expressing its intention of returning there about the 1st December to learn the result of the Chancellor&apos;s negotiations.In view of the serious state of affairs disclosed by these figures,  the Committee thought fit to examine, so far as possible,  the general situation, economic and financial of Germany.     The results of this examination are given under five chapters, viz:1 *     * u
I. German Budget, 1921-1922 .II. German Budget, 1P22--1923 .111. Amount of Foreign Bills necessary for the Economic Life of Geiv&amp;py between 1st September 1923. and 1st May 3.922.IV. Method adopted by the German Government to obtain Pore 1 go. Bills -V. Balance of Account in Foreign Bills as givenin the Report on tho present Economic Situation.Chapter I Budget &apos;o ji92ji--l^.,Tho net result of the Committee&apos;s researches was to establish a deficit of 733 milliards of paper marks. This deficit includes 58 milliards of paper marks, which is the estimated amount due by Germany under the &quot;Etat des Paiements&quot; etc., for tha year in question, at the rate of 1 gold mark = 30 paper marks.The Committee called attention firstly to the fact&apos; that the German Government has not succeeded in getting, any of its projects for increased taxation, voted.bythe Reichstag up to the present, as a result of which it Is unlikely that any of them will be in force before the end of 1921.     They also called attention to certain particulars in which the German Government he.3, apparently, not taken the necessary measures to decrease expenses,noticeably
noticeably with regard to railway expenses and bread subsidies.Chapter II. _Budget 1922-1923.The Committee anticipate on this Budget, even after the new project of taxation has come into foroe, a deficit of 91.6 milliards of paper marks, a figure of 100 milliards having been reckoned as the &quot;Etat des Paiements&quot; contribution-tion at the rate of 2 5 paper marks to 1 gold mark.The Committee criticise, in the same way as in the Budget for the orevious year, certain item of expense. They also point out certain taxes which might, prima facie, be increased, but they realise the difficulty of giving any reliable information as to the Efforts made by Germany to balance her Budget from the taxation point of view, without a critical study of the comparative burden of taxation in various countries, such as is suggested by para-graph 12 of Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles.The Committee point out also that the programme of taxation for 1922-23 is at present Incomplete, owing to the difficulties which have arisen with regard to the Erfassung der Gold Werte, or Capital Levy.In Chapter III the Committee have examined into the amount of foreign currencies necessary for Germany5s economic life from September 1921 to 1st May 1922.     They find that the monthly requirements in this respect are in the neighbourhood of 350 millions of gold marks, assuming that
that the &quot;Etat dea Paiements&quot; is complied with in full. The actual quantities of foreign currencies obtained by the Government during the months of May, June, July and August, 1921, i ,e. before the rapid depreciation of the mark were:-May . . . June .. July .. AugustChapter IV deals with the method employed by the German Govern-ment for procuring foreign currencies.     This Chapter&quot;is particularly important, since it treats of the question of putting into force the 2 5;* levy on exports, provided for in the &quot;Eaat des Paiements&quot;.       Up to the time of their visit to Berlin in September the Committee had not thought it necessary to put this Levy Into force, in view of the considerable practical difficulties attendant thereon, since it appeared probable that the German Government would be able to provide the necessary foreign currencies without it.   Now that it appears probable that the German Government will not be able to,provide them, it becomes necessary to decide whether the Levy should be put into force.   &quot;While not arriving at any definite conelxision on this point the Committee is of opinion :-l) that the German Government should not authorise German exporters to-utilise their foreign curren-cies for any reason other than their strict commercial needs:2) that foreign currencies obtainable on the market should. 264 millions of gold marks . .. 228 &quot;   . &quot;... 12 5 &quot; &quot;
should not he diverted from Government needs tothe pockets of speculators. In Chapter V there is an attempt to show what is the probable German balance in foreign bills for the present year, taking into account all the foreign currencies re-quired both for the payment of imports and all other needs.The German estimate of the deficit in this respect is rather more than 5 milliards gold marks, including the &quot;Etat des Paiements&quot; liability.     The Committee acting on information which is, to say the least of it, vague, are inclined to think this estimate too high.The Committee then proceed to state their conclusions. The first part of these conclusions is devoted to a summary of the particulars with regard to. which the German Govern-ment may be accused, with some justice, of failure tomtake adequate measures, either to balance their Budget by ir-creasing receipts and diminishing expenses, or to proc\tre the necessary foreign currencies by energetic action.       The Committee, while taking into account the political difficult ties of the German Government since last May, are of opinion that tho German Government has not taken sufficient advantage of the inherent wealth of Germany.The Committee proceed to point out that, serious as has been the fall of the mark, It will be, so far as the Budg
is concerned, eventually compensated for to some extent by an increase in receipts.     They lay special stress, however, on the necessity for stabilising the mark, by an increase of taxation, rigid diminution of expenses and a stoppage at the earliest possible moment of the issue of fresh currency.The next point raised is the necessity.of more energetic action with regard to foreign currencies held abroad by large industrial concerns, and they conclude by stating that Germany cannot comply with her imminent Treaty obligations except by recotirse to some financial combination Involving a mortgage of her capital resources.        The German Government is now engaged in negotiations with prominent industrials in this connection.    If the Government is successful in obtaining by this means the foreign currencies necessary to carry her over the instalments up to the 15th April, a respite will be gained which can, in the words of the Committee, &quot;be utilised for studying in concert with the German Government a series of measures which, while i ending to produce greater stability in the mark, will at the same time, facilitate the solution of the Reparation problem.&quot;If, on the other hand, the operation is unsuccessful the Committee point out that it is much to be feared that the German Government will declare itself unable to make the next payment due under the &quot;Etat des Paiements&quot; .The Committee concludes by calling the Immediate attention of the Reparation Commission to the situation.The Report Is accompanied by a number of Annexes containing the detail on which the Report has been based.There
There is also an a..ddirti.onaA note by the American Vn--i^tljSxBXM^o^n^ru^^o, containing a plain statement of his opinion that the &quot;Etat dos Paiemonts&quot; in its pre sent form is beyond the resources of Germany to carry out; and advocating a modification thereof.The following personal remarks may be of interest to you, as indicating the trends of opinion of the Committeew ich have beer noticeable during cur visit to Berlin and_______in the course of preparing the Report,^I!^^2-J^ P -l ?^lle^!l)J2?i.*     Ac I have already Stated, the Committee were unanimous in thinking that Ger-wany can only meet her obligations falling due up to and including April 3,5th by means cf se-ne form of emergency contribution of foreign currencies furnished by her Indus-trial ccnmun.it y,     The time is too short, and the figures are tod overwhelming, to make any difference of opinion on this point possible,     $or was there any difference of opinion as to the duty of the Committee to sail the attention of the Commission to this position.     Beyond this point, however, the Committee would not Have been in a position to advance unanimously; either on the question of the measures to be taken in the event of a default, or as to the possibility or otherwise of Germany fulfilling her reparation obligations in general.My American colleague has put forward a report con-tending that there are clear and convincing reasons for I the
the immediate modification of the existing Schedule of Payments.   My French colleague, on the other hand, has throughout tended to the opinion that the default, if it occurs, might easily have been prevented by Germany and that it cannot be established firmly that Germany is unable to fulfil her obligations since full advantage has not, in his opinion, been taken of the essential wealth of the country.My Belgian colleague and I tend to the opinion expressed by the American representative.   Vie were however of opinion that it was better at the present sta&amp;e for the Committee to lose no time in presenting the facts to the Reparation Commission, with an invitation to that body to review the whole question, rather than to embark on the thorny question of Germany1s capacity to comply with the Schedule of Payments in general.M. Bernelmans therefore drafted, in the first place, a report which was limited to these conclusions, and the Committee appeared to be generallyln agreement therewith before we left Berlin.   M. Bernelmans appended to his draft a recommendation that the Commission should them-selves visit Berlin at the earliest possible moment.   In ac-accordance with your instructions, I objected to this para-graph, which was after some discussion omitted.   When however after our return the report came to be discussed more in detail the
the President proposed a series of alterations, the general tenor of which was to emphasise very strongly (almost violently) the steps which the German Government has failed to take in order to fulfil its obligations and to omit anything In the shape of an Invitation to the Reparation Commission to consider the problem as a whole.   /Certain parts of his draft, moreover, appeared to advance the opinion that a sort of permanent levy on capital might be brought Into force to an extent which would enable Germany to fulfil herrsparation obligations in the future.       Had he persisted in this attitude, I should have felt it my duty to have made a separate report much more on the lines of that of Colonel Logan.   It was my opinion however that the French Government and their representative on the Commission would not fall to take full advantage of a report on the lines proposed by the President, even if it were accom-panied by reports of a different tenor from other members of the Committee.   I therefore considered it desirable, while admit-ting to some extent the amendments proposed by the President, to obtain unanimity on the general lines of the Bemelraans draft.   In other words, it seemed to me that the trend of the   -facts, coupled with the invitation to the Reparation Commission to consider the problem as a whole, would be all that was necessary to make such consideration possible from the strictly formal point of view, and the,advantages of such a report being unanimous appeared important.German Budgets.     Both the budget of 1921-22,  and that of 1922-23 are thoroughly unsatisfactory.
(1)    Budget for 1921-22 .   This budget shews a deficit of at least 73&amp; milliards, and at this period of time nothing can be done to reduce it materially.   There has undoubtedly been an indefensible delay in voting the new taxes which the German Government attribute to their politeal difficulties.   These have no doubt been great, but I think that a more energetic policy could have been pursued.   I am of opinion also that further economies might have been made in expenses,  such as bread subsidies, railway construction,  etc. In this respect also, political difficulties are alleged, and again with some justice.       The only proposal for covering the deficit is the issue of further currency - a thoroughly bad expedient. - .It is easy however to talk, as the Committee have done in their report, of the necessity of raising an internal loan-     Such a loan -would be unlikely to succeed If the present policy of the Reich was pursued-     One looks in vain however for any really energetic move in the direction of a saner ffh-financial policy.   The German apologists lay stress on the impossi-bility of balancing the German budget so long as the crush-ing burden of the reparation obligations continues-    They are probably right, but 1 am convinced that much more could have been done than has been done,  even taking Into account the political situation of the Government.(^-)    Budget 1922-25.       This budget which is based on a series of new measures not yet voted only balances if thereparation
obligations are left out of account.    Apart from the question of the coal tax and of certain minor taxes, such as beer, sugar and alcohol which might well be increased, it is difficult to criticise this budget in its present form since it is really Incomplete.   The intention of the Government was to combine with the measures already put before the Reichstag some form of a levy on capital or 1 Erfas sung der Goldwerte&apos;.   This project, after passing through many forms, is now taking shape as a semi-forced contribution by the Industrials etc. of Germany to cover the reparation payments up to May.     The Committee has found It very difficult to criticise this budget, firstly owing to the national feeling that is aroused in connection with the coal tax, secondly because the project of a levy on capital has as a matter of fact raised very serious political difficulties, and thirdly because no valuable criticism is possible with-out arriving at some sort of estimate as to the limit of taxable capacity of the German population.The Committee is embarking on a study of this last question in connection with Paragraph 12b of Annex II of Part VIII of the Treaty, but I doubt whether any very certain result will be achieved.Coal Tax.     A number of discussions have taken place In the Committee on this subject, and the position is now as follows :My Belgian and American colleagues and myself con-si der that it might be increased very largely and that theGerman
German Government cannot be regarded as having done everything In their power to avoid default so long as this is undone. &apos;&amp;sy Italian colleague and the President are of opinion that no representation should be made to Germany on the subject.The Italian representative has argxaed against the tax on two grounds - firstly, on the ground that thereby the price of reparation coal would be increased to a figure which would make it unattractive to the Allies who receive it, and secondly, that it would so injure Germany1s exporting capacity as to do more harm than good, and thirdly, that it would lead to such large increases in salaries and wages as to produce political difficulties and a general rise in price, thus de-feat ing its own object.The President has confined himself more particular-ly to the formal objection that an increase In the coal tax should not be considered without taking into account the pos-sibility of an increase in other taxes or of its effect on the taxable capacity of Germany In other respects.    I have little doubt, however, that in reality he is influenced largely by the first consideration advanced by the Italian reprssentative.I pressed Herr Schroeder strongly on the subject of this tax when in Berlin and received no very adequate rea-son why it should not be increased     I formed the impression, however, that he was influenced by the fear, possibly implan-ted in him by others of my colleaues, that the raising ot the tax was not regarded as desirable by their Governments.    This question is the subject of a short report by Mr. Logan and myself   whichwill
will be found at the end of Annex III, Supply of Foreign Qu^encies, .This question has been very&apos; fully discussed in the Report, and I have little to add to Mr Lelth Ross&apos; remarks thereon in his report of 7th October.The Committee&apos;s report lays a good deal of stress on the failure of the Gorman Government to lay their hands on the necessary foreign currencies.     I think that the German Government have proceeded somewhat timidly,     I am however by no means convinced that better results will in fact be got by bringing the Exports Levy into force - and % am in agreement with the proposal to consult the Committee of Banking Experts, which the Reparation Commission have decided to convene on foreign currency questions, bofore insisting on its being done.      In fact I did put the proposal before the Committee but did not think it worth pressing at the time for certain tactical reasons, GENERAL    CONCLUSIONS.It is hardly necessary for me to point out again the imminent danger of a default by Germany.The Committee of Guarantees will, unless otherwise instructed by the Commission, return to Berlin at the end of the present month, and it is much to be feared that they will find that the arrangements with the Industrials have not been concluded.     They will thus be confronted with a situation of extreme gravity.     If any measures can usefully be taken to avert this contingency they should be taken at onco.Apart however from the immediate difficulties of30. tho
the situation it seems quite evident that unless the hidden resources of German capital in tho form of foreign currencies are much larger than has been suspected up to the present and can be made available, Germany will be quite unable to carry out the Etat des Paiements until the mark can be stabilised.Prom the point of view of the Budget the position is grotesque.The deficit for 1922/3 reckoned by the Committee during their visit to Berlin at 91.6 milliards of paper marks is at the present rate of exchange approximately 179 milliards paper marks and may be anything to-morrow. Increased revenue will no doubt accrue, but on the other hand prices are reacting and wages will rise, with con-sequent additions to the expense side of the Budget.The monthly requirements of the Reich in foreign currencies are estimated at 350 mil. gold marks, if the Etat des Paiemonts obligations are to be carried out in full. During September the Reich&apos;s devisen besschaffungstelle only obtained 71 mil, gold marks and during October only 60. There is little doubt that with the mark at 840 to  1, they will be even less successful in November.The expedient of a loan from the industrials may relieve the situation temporarily, but one is forced to the conclusion that the mark will continue to be subject to violent and dangerous oscillations so long as the Government is forced to buy foreign currencies across the exchange in face of an adverse trade balance,  in order tofurnish
furnish the Reparation payments.If these payments were suspended, or at any rate much reduced, for a period, and a determined attempt then made by the German Government to balance their budget and stop printing new currency, some stability might attach to the mark.     Germany might then be In a position to obtain the foreign credits necessary to carry out her Reparation obligations.4/H/sl32.
