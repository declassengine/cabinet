E ToC A B 1 N E TV ^DRAFT OF THE KING1S SPEECH, OPENING OF PARLIA-MBNT, 14th DECEMBER, 1921c My^J^rds and ^embers of -the ,,House of ,.Cjoiranons^I have summoned you to meet at this unusual timein order that the Articles of Agreement which have been signed by My Ministers and the Representatives ofSouthern Ireland may be at once submitted for yourapproval.No other business will be brought before you in the present Session.It was with heartfelt joy that i learnt of the Agree-ment at length attained between My Ministers end the Representa-tives of Southern Ireland after negotiations protracted for many months.       The welfare of peoples far beyond these islands depended in grave measure upon their success; for the British and Irish races are as closely intermingled in the younger nations of the Empire as in the homelands from which those nations sprung.The Articles of Agreement now submitted to you have been framed with that intent.     It is My flm conviction that under them the recurring strife of many centuries will at last be appeased, and that Ireland, as a free, integral and governing member of My Empire,   will find in them the long-sought realisation of her national ideals.     In that belief,, I commend them to you, knowing well that no event can conduce so greatly to the welfare of My subjects, the strength of the Commonwealth and the cause of peace throughout the world.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 12th December, 1921.
