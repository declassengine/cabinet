document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; s Go vernment.) x0 A 3 I in I, Copy No, ^520 .Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Sxcheauer.I ask for an early decision from the Cabinet on a question arising out of the execution of the Treaty of Versailles.     Under Article 185 of the Treaty Germany under-took the breaking up of the German surface warships under construction under the supervision of the Allies.,     Article 181 allows Germany to have, inter alia,  six light cruisers in commission, and Article 190 provides that these can only be replaced when they are 20 years old and that they are not to exceed 60COO tons;     Ho building is permitted except for re-placement,     Article 189 provides that the material arising from the breaking up of warships is not to be used except for purely industrial or commercial purposes&quot;.In the German Eaval Budget for 1920 provision was made for the construction of a new light cruiser (for replacement purposes in accordance with Article 190) at a cost f 200,000,000 paper marks.   In view of the recent fall in the mark the actual cost in paper marks must now be far greater hah this figure.   The German Government submitted to the nter-Allied  aval Commission of Control that an&apos; important Budget economy would result if a cruiser&apos; (or parts of it) due to be broken up under Article 186 could be retained by er in lieu of the one which she desires to construct, &quot;he Commission however rejected this proposal on the ground that it was contrary to the terms of the Treaty.The
The matter has now been taken up by the Committee of Guarantees who are anxious to facilitate any efforts by the German Government tending towards Budget economy and have asked the Conference of Ambassadors to decide in favour of the German request.I udder stand that the Admiralty are in agreement with the decision of the Naval Commission, and for reasons which are not without weight.   The-German proposal is $indubitably a breach of the Treaty and Germany has made repeated attempts to oppose the execution of the Kaval Clauses of the Treaty.     It can moreover be argued that It is quite Ltnnecessary for Germany to build up to the limits of her powers under the Treaty, but in my opinion there are considerations on the other side which should outweigh the objections of the Admiralty.     The breach of the Treaty is purely technical and it is very difficult for the Allies to take the line that Germany should be satisfied with a smaller Kavy than that allowed under the Treaty.     He should therefore welcome an arrangement which would remove from the expenditure side of the German Budget the whole or any part of the cost of the new cruiser.     Every step towards reducing the deficit of Germany&apos;s ordinary Budget is a step towards the rehabilitation of her currency and an addition to her capacity to pay reparations.     Moreover it is to be noted that all the financial representatives of the Allies are agreed in recommending the concession,&apos; and it would be veryregrettable
weregrettable if &quot;the-British&apos;. Government should Appear to be in the position of refusing to consent to an alleviation of Germany&apos;s burdens which the other Allies are ready to accept.     I submit therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris should be instructed to propose at the Conference of Ambassadors that the German Governments request should be agreed to.(Initialled) R.S.H.TREASURY, 3J..1.1st December.&quot; 1621..
