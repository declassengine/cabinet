% /.. J-([This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]secret.CP. 3592.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1922.TURKISH PEACE.CABINET.I circulate the following extracts from a letter which has been forwarded to me from the Commissioner in Sincl to the Governor of Bombay.; The part omitted relates to Police and other internal matters.E. S. M.4th January 1922.I write in reply to your letter of the 6th December enquiring as to possible difficulties arising out of the present political situation in Sind, and the precautions to be taken to meet them.So far as Stud is concerned, I am convinced that the only real danger with which we are confronted is the due arising out of the tension of Muhammadan feeling in consequence of the Turkish question. As 1 have noted more than once in forwarding the District Magistrates&apos; weekly letters, the feeling that British policy has been directed against Islam is becoming more and more widespread, and is arousing more and more bitterness. It is practically useless to attempt to counteract this tendencyr for all the appearances, and even the facts are against us, and also we are kept, in the dark as to the nature and aim of the policy of the British Government in regard to this question. All we can do is, as 1 have been consistently doing, to express personal sympathy with Mussalman feeling on the question, and to ask them to believe that everything is being done to represent that feeling fully at home. But one feels very helpless, for obviously the time is now past when such assurances can be expected to have any practical effect. The fact that France has come to terms with the Kemalists seems to have shown the fallacy of the theory that Great Britain was being impeded by her allies from taking steps towards effecting a satisfactory settlement of the Turkish question.I anticipate that the Khilafat agitation will continue to become more and more active and effective, so long as this question is not settled. Fortunately for us in Sind it is still closely linked up by the professional agitators with Gandhi-ism, an association which lias the result of alienating from the anti-Government movement many who are completely in sympathy with the Khilafat movement per se. The &apos; essential features of Gandhi-ism makes it utterly repugnant to the better class Sind Muhammadan feeling, and simultaneously the zamindars are alarmed by its revolu-tionary and suspected communistic tendencies. &quot;Swaraj&quot; is a catch word which makes no appeal to the Sind Muhammadans as a whole. Therefore, although a very large proportion of the zamindars are Kliilafatist at heart, yet I believe that it will be a long time before they will throw Government over. The classes among the Muhammadans who are badly affected at present are the fanatical and for the most part ignorant mullas and moulvas who swarm all over the Province, a few Pirs. and the low class Muhammadans of the towns who are petty shopkeepers, artisans or labourers.   The haris or agricultural labourers are also becoming affected in places.I believe that, if a settlement of the Turkish question acceptable to moderate Mussalman opinion could be speedily effected, the non-co-operation movement in Sind would collapse like a house of cards.The danger in the event of such a settlement being indefinitely postponed is that the more extreme Khilafatist section will break away from the non-co-operation movement and make a frank and avowed appeal to force. With feeling as exasperated as it is now becoming, such a move might carry with it a large part of the community and serious disorders would then ensue. There appears to be some apprehension among the Hindus that such a development may take place. The Malabar tragedies have not been without their effect on their minds. I found the Hindu communities who are more or less isolated in the smaller mofussil towns inclined to be alarmed by the increasing aggressiveness of flu; Khilafat spirit around them.5010      100   .1.22
As regards the measures to be taken, I. have already indicated that, in my opinion, the first essential is a speedy settlement with Turkey, fending this, it is necessary to be prepared to put. clown any outbreak of violence that may p^$fj$,r)J%8* this we require the absolute loyalty of the Police.Provided that the Police remains loyal, I. do not regard the position in Sincl with any serious anxiety. The Sindhi is a great;talker, but generally deficient in courage aud powers of action, specially concerted action. Put it is not sufficient to be free from actual clanger. What we are all longing for here in Sincl is the re-establish-ment of good relations with the great mass of the people, and the insuperable obstacle to this is the Turkish question. At present we live in an intolerable atmosphere of suspicion&apos;and hostility either suppressed or overt.
