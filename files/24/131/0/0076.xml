[This Document is the Property of Kis Britannic Majestys Government.-]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP.-3575. &amp;  cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE  OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary eor Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 19th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.The steady progress towards the establishment of a workable modus vivendi and a better understanding between the parties to the Truce throughout the country to which I have drawn attention in my recent reports has been rudely arrested by the events of the past week. For the first time since the commencement of the Truce policemen have fallen victims to the hand of the assassin, and it is not surprising that in certain districts the effect of these tragedies has been to arouse a dangerous sense of insecurity combined with feelings of strong resentment among all ranks of the Crown Forces. I am glad to state that the responsible leaders of Sinn Fein have / shown themselves to be deeply impressed with the gravity of the situation, and have / issued announcements in the press strongly condemning the perpetrators of these/ crimes as &quot; cowardly individuals,&quot; and promising to use every effort to bring them to justice. There is reason to believe, however, that this recrudescence of violence is directly connected with the differences of opinion in the ranks of Sinn Fein, which have disclosed themselves in regard to the ratification of the Treaty, and that it represents the deliberate attempt on the part of irreconcilable extremists to settle the political issue by a rupture of the Truce which they hoped would precipitate an immediate renewal of hostilities.The casualties resulting from these outrages were the murders of two policemen and the wounding of a military officer and three policemen. The first of the two police murders was that of Sergeant Maher, R.I.C., who was shot dead in Ballybunion village, Listowel District, Co. Kerry, on the evening of the 13th instant. A Constable who was with him at the time was seriously injured. I regret to state that the assassins, who appear to have numbered at least four, made good their escape. The other murder was that of Sergeant Enright, R.I.C., who together with a Constable was attacked while on leave and in plain clothes at Kilmallock, Co. Limerick, about 11 p.m., on the 14th instant by a party of about seven or eight men who lay in wait for them near the hotel at which they were lodging, the Sergeant being shot dead and the Constable seriously wounded. It is possible that the selection of Sergeant Enright for attack was due to the fact of his being a member of the Thurles Police Force, the intention of the assassins being to suggest that his death was an act of reprisal for the alleged bombing attack by the police on a train at Thurles on the 9th instant with which I dealt in my last Report. I regret to state that no further information in regard to this incident has yet come to light, and that one of the internees who was wounded by a&apos; bomb splinter has since died. The murderers of Sergeant Enright have not yet been identified and are still at large, but no effort will be spared to bring them to justice.The other attacks on members of the Crown Forces during the week were the wounding of Captain 0&apos;Malley, of the Munster Fusiliers, who was fired at by two unknown men and wounded while out rabbit-shooting at Ballyheigue, Tralee District, Co. Kerry, on the 12th instant, and the firing at and wounding of a Constable at Car low Railway Station on the evening of the 15th instant.I attach at the end of this memorandum a copy of a letter addressed from my office on the 16th instant to the Sinn Fein Chief Liaison Official, together with copies of statements issued subsequently by the Sinn Fein &quot;Cabinet &quot; and by the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Official.A document which came into the possession of- the Government on the 18th instant contained very disquieting particulars of a plot, in which at least one high.T7532]       . &apos; &apos; B
officer of the Tipperary Brigade of the I.R.A. was implicated, for tunnelling under-neath the foundations of police barracks in that county, and disclosed that instructions had actually been given for these operations to commence on the 15th instant. The document was at once brought to the notice of the Sinn Fein leaders in Dublin who disclaimed all knowledge of the matter and readily agreed to a joint inspection being made without delay of the premises adjacent to any police barracks to which danger might be apprehended. There is no reason for suspecting that, any of the responsible Sinn Fein leaders, even of those who are known to be strenuously resisting the ratification of the Treaty, were cognisant of this criminal and treacherous design, which is clearly attributable, however, to the same band of. fanatical extremists among their followers, who are endeavouring to restart the campaign of police assassination in the hope of frustrating any settlement which falls short of recognising an independent Irish Republic.Six cases of illegal arrest were reported during the week, in two of which the persons arrested are known to have been released.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Seven trials of civilians by Court-Martial were concluded during the week, resulting in four convictions and three acquittals. The convictions included the case of a civilian arrested on the charge of shooting at the police during the Tipperary disturbances of the 28th September last. Strong local feelings were aroused by this conviction and by the sentence of penal servitude for life imposed by the Court-Martial, and the case was represented to the Irish Government by the Sinn Fein Liaison Authorities as a grave miscarriage of justice. After carefully reviewing the circumstances of the occurrence, the Commander-in-Chief felt justified in remitting the whole of the sentence, a decision in which I fully concur. Two of the other cases of conviction were for the illegal possession of arms and ammunition. A fine of  10 was imposed in each case, with three months&apos; imprisonment in default of payment, but was remitted in one case by the Confirming Officer. The remaining case was one of theft and sentence of nine months&apos; imprisonment was imposed. The acquittals included the case of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary charged with attempted murder and the case of another Constable charged with manslaughter.State of the Police Forces.

Dublin Metropolitan Police.The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged throughout the week at 1,134.Present Political Situation in Ireland.At the time of writing this report Dail Eiieann is still debating the question of ratifying the Treaty, and it would be impossible to prophesy with confidence which way the decision will go. There is no doubt that Mr. de Valera&apos;s following in that Assembly is much greater than was generally anticipated, and present indications point to a closely contested result. The Nationalist press of the whole country is giving energetic support to Mr. Griffith, and although there have been no striking manifestations of popular feeling on either side, it is generally accepted that a large majority of the people are in favour of ratification. Mr.&apos; Griffith himself says 95 per cent, of the people of Ireland are in favour. The present Dail Eireann, however, is wholly composed of nominees imposed upon the constituencies by the Sinn Fein Organisation for election without opposition at a time when extreme uncompromising opinions, strength of character, and past personal sacrifices counted for more than qualities of statesmanship, and in the changed circumstances that have arisen many of them cannot claim to be, in any real sense, representative of their constituents. If the rejection of the Treaty, or its ratification by a very narrow majority, renders an appeal to the country necessary, there is every reason to believe that a more moderate Assembly will be returned which will pronounce decisively in favour of peace.H irish Office, Old Queen Street, S.W.1, December 21, 1921.APPENDIX.Copy of a Letter addressed from the Chief Secretary&apos;s Office to the Sinn Fein ChiefLiaison Official.Chief Secretary&apos;s Office, Sir, Dublin Castlei December 16, 1921.THE circumstances which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, made the issue by them of an official statement immediately after they learned of the bomb outrage at Thurles on the 9th instant, apply with equal force to the two cases of deliberate murder which have occurred in the last three days at B&amp;llybunion and Kilmallock. I have, therefore, to urge upon you the necessity for a widely published statement of repudiation by official Sinn Fein of these crimes, which are, you will agree, atrocious breaches of truce if the perpetrators are members of your forces.I must warn you that the frame of mind of police who see men with whom they were &quot; at war &quot; a few months ago walking about openly, protected by the Truce, while they themselves feel that they are not immune from attack and assassination, is a source of growing anxiety, and I have to press upon your consideration of the view that the statement for which I ask would be not only a clear warning to the men who are taiung upon themselves the responsibility for such acts of violence, but would have to some extent a calming effect upon the Police.i am, &amp;c.(Signed)        MARK STURGIS.J. E. Dalton, Esq.,Acting Chief Liaison Officer,Gresham Hotel, Dublin.On the 16th December, 1921, the following statement was issued by the Republican Chief Liaison Officer, Dublin: &quot; It is with the greatest dismay and regret that I read the accounts of the shootings of members of theR.I.C. and British Forces.[7532] B 2
&quot; I have confidence that such deeds are not the acts of members of the I.R.A., but are the acts of cowardly individuals who endeavour to cloak their misdeeds in such a manner that they may be interpreted as the actions of soldiers of the Republican Army.&quot; Should it, however, be proved to be the work of members of the I.R.A., the General Staff have decided to take most drastic action against the perpetrators.&quot;The following statement was also issued from the Chief Liaison Office: &quot; Declan Horton died in Cork at 3 o&apos;clock to-day. He was one of those wounded in the bombing of the internees&apos; train at Thurles.&quot;On the following day, i.e., the 17th December, 1921, the following statement was issued by the &quot; Cabinet &quot; of Dail Eireann : &quot; The Cabinet of Dail Eireann has had to-day before it reports of four attacks on the British Forces in Ireland, two members of which have been killed.&quot; The Cabinet is of opinion that these acts were not committed by members of the Republican Forces, and it condemns them in the strongest manner.&quot; The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Home Affairs have been directed to investigate.,the occurrences, and to use every effort to bring the perpetra-tors to justice.&quot;
