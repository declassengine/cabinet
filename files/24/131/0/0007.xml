f\&apos;K- it from Governor of Bombay, 19th November 1921. (Addressed Viceroy ; repeated to Secretary of State.)Private. Prince&apos;s visit. All three functions at Poona this morning passed off very successfully. An immense crowd awaited the Prince at the Shivaji Memorial, estimated at about 20,000. His Royal Highness after functions walked all round arena and was enthusiastically cheered. Afterwards he reviewed some 2,500 ex-soldiers and received equally warm reception.But the welcome at the races was something really remarkable. Prince walked through every enclosure through dense crowds with perfect safety for more than half-an-hour amidst deafening cheers, which never ceased until he returned to the stand. I cannot imagine any finer welcome in any country.The day ended by his driving from Ganeshkind to the station through route lined by soldiers with torchlights. You may rest assured that Poona visit was a triumphant success.In my opinion this was entirely due to his own personality and to his influence with crowd, which surpassed even what I had beeu led to believe.Bombay situation has been very disturbed and considerable rioting continued until to-day, but is much improved this evening. I will report further to you on arrival in Bombay.4877      100   11.21[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.
