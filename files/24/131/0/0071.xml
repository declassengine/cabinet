SECRET.Interim Keport of Committee on National Expenditure.To the Right Hon. Sir Robert Horne, G.B.E:, K.C., M.P.,THE subject which you have referred to us for investigation is one of such complexity, and the need for effecting immediate retrenchment of public expenditure is so imperative, that we think it best not to delay reporting until we have covered the whole field, but to render our preliminary observations to you in the form of an Interim Report, and we understand that this procedure will be agreeable to you. We have dealt with Departments where great expenditure is involved, as it is in those Departments that substantial economies must be looked for.We will report subsequently upon the other Departments where the money involved makes it impossible to suggest large reductions.In May of this year, the Treasury issued a circular to all Departments of Government on the subject of &quot; Restriction of Public Expenditure.&quot; In this circular,! the vital need of a heavy reduction in the estimates of the ordinary Supply Expendi-ture for 1922/23 was emphasised, and immediate proposals to that end were called for. It was plainly indicated that the cost of the Ordinary Supply Services, viz.,  603,000,000 for 1921/22, must be reduced to  490,000,000 for 1922/23.The situation, as explained to the Departments in May, demanded a reduction of  113,000,000, but you have since asked us to aim at economies which in the total would effect a reduction of expenditure of  175,000,000.The Government Departments, in response to the Treasury circular of May last, have themselves proposed reductions amounting in all to  75,000,000, so that there remains a sum of  100,000,000 to be secured by further reductions.In many cases, the reductions proposed by the Departments are automatic, due to the fall of prices and wages, or to windfalls or to the cessation of special expendi-ture on services arising out of the war. The reductions in estimates shown in response to your circular are therefore by no means fully the result of curtailment of activity, or of economical administration, and this point cannot be too clearly brought out.In this Interim Report we deal with the following Services : The provisional estimates for 1922/23, after making the reductions of  75,000,000 referred to above, amount to  528,000,000 for Ordinary Supply Services. The Services covered by this Interim Report account for  390,000,000 of that total. Ninety-six Votes (excluding Irish Departments) remain for examma-tion, accounting for the balance of  138,000,000.Our report is the result of close study of the estimates and of consultation with the Treasury and Ministers and officials of the Departments named.While we will later refer to the very important question of Treasury control of Departmental expenditure, it will, we think, assist you in understanding the form of our recommendations if we explain how we understand Treasury control over the framing of the Estimates of the Fighting Services to have been exercised before the war.Chancellor of the Exchequer.SirNavy.Army.Air Force.Education.Health.Labour.Old Age Pensions.

The procedure, as explained to us by experienced Treasury officials, was broadly that the estimates of the previous year or years were taken to form a base line, and that the deviations from that line were arrived at by consultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister at the head of the Department. As a result of the consultation, the Minister would know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to budget for estimates representing a certain sum of money, and would tell his Department the amount available for the following year&apos;s estimates.The essence of this system was to take the previous year&apos;s normal expenditure, from which to measure departure. Whilst not in any way commending this principle as ideal, it is obviously better than the present practice, under which, owing to the dislocation of the war, the Treasury have been driven to criticising in detail, with inadequate data and with insufficient time for the purpose.- During the war, in the case of the Fighting Departments, the Government Avas obliged to accept the statements of the Naval and Military advisers as to the money required by their Departments.In our opinion, the time has come when the Government must say to these Departments how much money they can have, and look to them to frame their proposals accordingly.We have throughout stated in some detail where we think economies can be effected, and have arrived at conclusions as to the limits which should be communicated to the Departments within which their estimates should be framed.
PART I.INTRODUCTORY   REMARKS   ON   NAVY,   ARMY   AND   AIR  FORCEESTIMATES.Cost of Defence of the Empire.We have come to the conclusion that the cost of the defence of the Empire, so far as it falls upon the British taxpayer, must be considered as a whole. The necessity for this is much more apparent now than it was before the war, more especially because of the advent of the Air arm, which has come so much to the front, either as an addition to the older fighting services, or in substitution for them.1. The following figures show the growth of expenditure under the heading of Defence generally :  Fighting Services.Total Estimates.(Figures are net, and exclude terminal war charges* for 1922/23.)--	1914/15. f		1922/23.

In order to see how the estimates of money and personnel are framed, it is necessary to consider the principles upon which the three Departments have forecast their activities and expenditure.We understand that it was an instruction of the Government, given in the year 1919, that the estimates for the three Fighting Services were to be built up &quot;on the assumption that no great war was to be anticipated within the next ten years, although provision should be made for the possible expansion of trained units in case of an emergency.arising.&apos;:&apos;We have pursued our investigations in the light of &apos; this instruction to the Fighting Services.The Navy bases its estimates upon the principle of a &quot; One-Power Standard,&quot; which has been adopted by the Government, but it is obvious that the translation of that standard into   s. d. in the Estimates admits of great variation according to the views of the chief naval advisers and specialists.The Army has no such standard to guide it. It appears- that the Army Estimates are framed to provide certain garrisons overseas, together with- a system of reliefs for those garrisons, known as the &quot; Cardwell System.&quot; This has in the past resulted in a theoretical six Infantry Divisions and one Cavalry Division at home, which, together with certain additional Infantry units, formed the British Expedi-tionary Force in 1914. The estimates are cast to provide such a force again, only much more powerfully equipped; with additional arms, born of war experience: e.g., Tanks, Signals and Heavy Artillery and irrespective of the estimates of the Air Ministry.  A small provision is also made for Home Guards.* Figures not available for navy, but they are negligible.   Army total,  2,937,000.   Air,  504,900. t Including new naval construction : 1914/15,  15,628,257 ; 1922/23,  14,644.000.
The Air Force bases its estimates on different considerations. They provide for the needs of the Navy and Army as adjusted with the services concerned, and for the maintenance of a small independent force as a reserve. They also provide large sums of money for education, training and research in the art of air navigation ant fighting, and for civil aviation.It is from these three different standpoints that the estimates for the Fighting Services are framed.Improvement of Fighting Material.3. We select for special mention one outstanding feature which is common to these three estimates. The war created new problems, demonstrated weaknesses and suggested lines of development. The increase in activities coming under the head of Research, Experiment, Inspection and Education in all three services is very striking, as the following figures show :  !9J4/l:i. 19-22/23.   Research, Experiment and Inspection      702,580 4,217,795.    Educational Services        ... ...      447,000*       3,717,000*Total      ...    1,149,580 7,934,795The importance of this activity, however, is not merely measured by the money involved. It naturally carries in its train much indirect increase of expenditure, and also the substitution of new material for old, and of alterations in the engines of war. It inevitably also creates a&apos;tendency in the minds of technical advisers to prescribe an accelerated rate of obsolescence in war material.Increase in Fighting Power.4. We must record a very marked impression derived from long conference with the departmental representatives of the three Fighting Services.The estimates provide that in the year 1923, the fifth year after the Armistice was signed, with a broken and exhausted Europe and with no German menace, we are to have far greater fighting power, with a larger personnel, and greater prepara-tions for war than ever before in our -history. Additional services, more deadly weapons, additional systems are added to the old formations or to the old units.Apart from our detailed proposals for economy we are of opinion that the Estimates for the defence of the Empire lack co-ordination, and we have been forced to the conclusion that until that co-ordination is attained, overlapping and wasteful expenditure is inevitable.The Question of a Separate Air Force.5. The Air Force was essentially a war creation, and owed its separate existence mainly to the necessity for preventing competition between the Navy and the Army for men and material in aerial warfare. It was also felt at that time that a definite function of independent air attack was called for, but would not be realised unless the Air Arm was freed from Naval and Military control. No other nation, however, has as yet followed the example of this country in establishing such a separate force.The Navy and the Army both urge that the most effective and most economical use cannot be made of the Air Arm so long as the personnel is controlled by another service, and they suggest in general terms that it might be possible to effect econo-mies by utilising air forces in place of, say, light cruisers in the Navy or cavalry in the Army; but no concrete proposals on these lines have been furnished to us. The War Office also suggest economies in administration, for example, in supply, trans-port, education and medical services.On the other hand, it can be pointed out that by dividing the Air Force between :he. two Senior Services duplication in experiment, design and supply would be inevitable, and that duplicate flying schools would result. To avoid duplication the two Senior Services admit the need for a certain amount of joint organisation of a* Include nothing- for cost of personnel under training. Exclude Admiralty training establishments, and in the case of the Army the oost-of training given in the Units.
Chapter I.NAVY ESTIMATES, 1922/23.The net cash provision for the Navy shows the following comparisons :  Estimates  f1913/14      ... ... ... ... 46,309,3001914/15      ... ....... ... 51,550,0001921/22      ... ...      .   ... ... 82,479,0001922/23      ... ... ... ...  s 81,183,800subordinate character, but have given no clear appreciation of what this joint organisation should be.There is the further argument that without a separate existence there is a grave danger that the Air Service would be unable to work out developments which might in the next decade or so entirely revolutionise methods of attack and defence and so render possible very large economies in the cost of the Fighting Services as a whole, by substituting Air for Land or Sea Forces.We appreciate that it is only on financial grounds that our terms of reference would entitle us to express opinions on the question of a separate Air Force.We cannot say that we have been convinced that the Air Force is less economically administered than the other Fighting Services, but we are impressed by the fact that public funds are admittedly being spent in both of the older Services because of a certain overlapping with the Air, The question of aerial versus naval or military command in operations in the future will doubtless cause difficulties ; but economies to an increasing extent ought to result in the older Arms from the advent of the Air Force. We have in mind not only the substitution of aircraft for certain other arms of the older Services, such as light cruisers or cavalry, but a revolution in the method of carrying out certain operations. We are particularly impressed with the very large savings which we are told can be realised in the Middle East as soon as the transfer of responsibility from the Army to the Air Force can be effected.. By the use of aircraft in this region it has been found possible to reduce the estimates in respect of the Middle East from  27,000,000 in 1921/22 to  13,000,000 in 1922/23.It can no longer be denied that by the intelligent application of air power it is possible to utilise machinery in substitution for and not as a mere addition to Man-power.MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.6. In our opinion full economy in the Fighting Services cannot be realised under existing conditions. There is overlapping and duplication throughout. In order to fully realise these economies the three Forces must be brought together by the creation of a Co-ordinating Authority or a Ministry of Defence responsible for seeing that each Force plays its part and is allotted appropriate responsibility for carrying out various functions. The theory of such a Ministry in embryo appears already to exist in the Committee of Imperial Defence. With the creation of a Co-ordinating Authority or Ministry of this description it would be possible to ensure that corresponding reductions in expenditure were realised when either of the older Services was relieved or assisted, and no additional expense or extra Ministerial appointment need, in our opinion, be involved, as the Minister and his staff could all be drawn from existing organisations. All the arguments of an * economic character which have been urged for the absorption of the Air Force into the two older Services apply, in our opinion, also to the fusion of all three Services under one Minister. Complete co-ordination in Supply, Transport, Education, Medical and other Services would then be possible.We attach great importance to a settlement of this question in the interests of economy, and with these remarks we proceed to a consideration of the Estimates of the three Fighting Services individually.
A&apos; table, given as Appendix (A), shows, Vote by Vote, the comparison between the Estimates for 1914/15, 1921/22 and the Provisional Estimates for 1922/23.Preliminary Remarks.Of the  81,000,000 for which the Admiralty estimate in 1922/23,  11,816,000 is on account of the construction of the four new Capital Ships, the Contracts for which have been let but suspended. We make no comments on this expenditure, and throughout our report we have taken no account of any reductions which may result from the Washington Conference. If any agreement on the lines proposed by the President of the United States of America is arrived at, we could give further estimates of reduction.In present circumstances, therefore, we confine ourselves to the remaining approximate  70,000,000.Throughout our review, we have kept constantly in mind the instruction of the Government, given in 1919 to all the Eighting Services, &quot; that in framing their Estimates, they should proceed on the assumption that no great war is to be anticipated within the next ten years, although provision should be made for the possible expansion of trained units in the case of an emergency arising.&quot;The Admiralty have clearly given the deepest thought to the production of a thoroughly equipped force to meet immediately any possible Naval contingencies. Their plans seem to us to take too little account of the period of peace which they have been instructed to anticipate, and of the present serious financial condition of this country.We now proceed to examine the various Votes in detail.2.

The Admiralty have framed their Peace Fleet and their War Fleet; and (b.) The arrangements for manning these Fleets.3. (a.) The Basis of the Peace Fleet and War Fleet.The &quot; One-Power Standard &quot; upon which, the Admiralty are working involves &quot; that the Navy should be maintained in sufficient strength to ensure the safety of the British Empire and its sea communications as against any one other Naval Power.&quot; For this purpose the Admiralty keep a Peace Fleet which, in case of emergency, can be expanded into a War Fleet. The Fleet at present proposed for 1922/23 is composed as shown in the following table, in which it is divided into two main categories : (i.) With full complement:(ii.) In :&apos; Reserve &quot; in various states of readiness, with varying &quot;reduced complements.&quot; These ships do not go to sea-normally until brought up to full crews on mobilisation.

These numbers have presumably been based on a comparison with other Naval Powers.In the course of our conference with the Admiralty representatives, we ascertained that the British War Fleet comprises 30 Capital Ships, whereas the United States of America have only 20 Capital Ships of the Dreadnought type, and Japan 10. The Admiralty justify Great Britain&apos;s preponderance in a memor-andum which they have sent to us and which is contained in Appendix (C).We would only say that, as we understand Naval opinion, nothing we can do now in the way of keeping obsolescent ships in full commission or in reserve is going to make these latter a match for the post-Jutland ships eight years hence. It may be that, in the future, the political outlook may require that we should concentrate on building more post-Jutland ships, but&apos; that contingency is not for us to consider, and on a review of the present position, we are not satisfied that such a large Peace Fleet and potential War Fleet, as the Admiralty are planning, are required. A table is attached (Appendix (D)) giving the com-parative strengths at the present time of the War Fleets of Great &quot;Britain, the United States and Japan, in terms of &quot;Capital Ships,&quot; i.e.. battleships and battle cruisers. We have no ship launched earlier than 1910 out of our 30 Capital Ships. The United States have 9 out of 24, and Japan has 11 out of 21, If modernity in Capital Ships is the ultimate expression of power, we are maintaining an over-powering Fleet, involving great expense, in full upkeep and personnel.In view of the instruction of the Government that it may be assumed ,) that no great war is to be anticipated for some years, and in view of the comparative 1 strengths of the great Navies of the world at the present moment (as shown in ; Appendix   (D) ),   we   suggest   that   the   Government   should   discuss   with their Naval advisers the reduction of some of the Capital Ships now in &quot; Full Complement&quot; into &quot; Reserve &quot; and the reduction of a number now in Reserve to the Sale List.   We suggest that any reductions of Capital Ships should be accompanied by proportionate reductions of all classes of their ancillary craft, i.e., Light Cruisers, Torpedo Craft and Submarines.[7348] , C
We also suggest that the Government should consider whether the advantages gained from having a number of Light Cruisers &quot; showing the Flag&quot; in various parts of the world justify the large expenditure entailed. It is estimated that each light cruiser reduced to &quot; Reserve &quot; would mean a saving of  100,000 per annum in personnel, upkeep and running expenses, and that each light cruiser placed on the sale list would mean a further large saving.4. (b.) Manning Arrangements.The following is an extract from the Admiralty&apos;s explanation of the basis on which the Peace and War Fleets are manned (the full details are given in Appendix (E)) : &quot; The dominating factor in settling the numbers of officers and men required to be borne is the size of the War Fleet which is the list of actual ships allocated for carrying out the responsibilities of the Admiralty in the event of war.&quot;The.Fleet is actually maintained in peace on a different basis from what is required in war. In war, all the ships must be completed to full crews-either by active service ratings or with a proportion of Naval Reserves entered on mobilisation, according to the purpose for which, and the urgency with which the particular vessel would be required in case of emergency. In peace, only a certain proportion of the total War Fleet is kept in full commission, and the remainder are on reduced bases differing in status according to their position in the War Fleet.&quot; The following table shows the difference of status which exists in peace in relation to the War Fleets :-Status in Peace.&quot; (i.) Full crews active service. &quot; (i.)&quot; (ii.) Half crews active service. &quot; (ii.)&quot; (iii.) In reserve, crews varying from one-fifth &quot; (iii.) to one-tenth of full numbers.&quot;(iv.) Harbour   establishments, schools,  bar-   &quot;(iv.) racks,. &amp;c, permanent complements, instructors, experimental parties, and care of establishments.Status in War. Full crews active service.Two-fifths crews active service, balance naval reserves, entered on mobilisa-tion.Harbour establishments reduced in vary-ing degrees on account of certain duties which lapse in war.&quot; It is obvious that the difference between peace and war for (ii) and (iii) above and the whole of (iv) in peace will be in harbour or on shore in peace time, yet none could be dispensed with without prejudicing their ultimate disposal in war time. &apos;&quot;The difference between peace and war for (ii) and (iii) provides a working margin for the Fleet during peace. Men must be passed through training schools, travel to and from foreign stations and have leave, and there must always be a margin for sickness.&quot;We venture to invite your very careful study of this statement of the principles upon which the man power of the Navy is cast. It is of the utmost importance On examination we have come to the conclusion that these principles have not been accurately interpreted and that there has been excessive provision of men.The following table shows the personnel of the Navy, analysed under various heads, in 1914 and in 1921/2, and we invite your detailed consideration of these tables, pointing out that these are not estimates, but actuals, supplied by the Admiralty (see Appendix (E) 2):

It is clear, therefore, that while the Fighting Fleet under Group I has dropped in numbers, the auxiliaries and the shore establishments have increased in numbers very greatly. But that is not all. Although in the principles laid down by the Admiralty which we have detailed above, no mention is made of a margin over and above the necessary complements to bring ships and establishments up to their war crews of active service ratings, we find from this disintegration that in 1914 there was a margin not otherwise accounted for of 7,200 men, which has iioav, with a reduced Fleet and with increased provision in all establishments ashore, increased to 9,050, not accounted for or justified in any way whatsoever.With a reduction of 38,000 men in the year 1921/22 in Group I, which consists of the fighting ships of the Navy, it would not have been unreasonable to expect  having regard to the great need for economies, and the fact that the menace of the German Fleet across the North Sea no longer existed that a decrease could have been made in the shore establishments and in the ancillary craft compared with the numbers of personnel empkryed in 1914. On the contrary, however, there is an increase of 11,980 men, and on top of that, we have the further margin of the above-mentioned 9,050 men.We have considered what would be a reasonable allowance for the active service personnel of the Navy in all the circumstances existing to-day, and we make the following suggestions :  Group I: Fighting Ships.The Active Service strength required in war by the Admiralty to man all the ships retained in the 1922/23 Estimates is 68,600* men, and we have adopted this figure ... ... ... ... ... ...       68,600Group II and Group III: Depot Ships, Minelayers, Special Service Vessels, Harbour Ships at II ome and A broad, &amp;c. [exclusive af the Coastguard).It will be seen that with a fighting Fleet reduced to the one-Power standard nominally, and personnel for this Fleet reduced by 37 per cent., the Admiralty are providing increased numbers throughout in these Groups.We particularly draw attention to the increase in Harbour Ships at Home, Abroad, and in Retinues, and the very large increase which is shown in the table of ships below Submarines in Appendix (B), both in full complement and in reduced complement.It is clear that provision on a far more generous scale than was contemplated in 1914 is made for these ships, and in view of the imminence of war at that time, and of the remote possibility of war at the present time, we are of opinion that great reductions should be possible in these auxiliary and ancillary classes and establishments.We suggest that a 50 per cent, reduction on the 1914 full war complements would not be excessive, but we have adopted for the basis of this estimate the same percentage reduction in personnel as the Admiralty have themselves applied to the personnel of the fighting Fleet. If, in the opinion of the Government, this is too small a reduction, it could easily be increased, but a reduction of 37 per cent, gives an allowance of 14,300 men, which provides 4,347 active service ratings required in peace, but whose places could be filled in war by Reservists, or men from Mercantile Marine, &amp;c. ... ...&quot;       ...      14,300Coastguard.In view of our recommendations in para. 11, we are of the opinion that the peace complement retained in war of 2,000 should be reduced by 25 per cent., leaving 1,500 men        ... ... &apos;       ... ... ...        1,500* This figure is less than the 71,170 shown on previous page, because the Admiralty propose to man fewer ships in 1922/23 than in 1921/22.
Group IV: Cadets and Boys in Training.We are of the opinion that the numbers for 1922/23 * should be the 1921/22 numbers reduced pro rata to the personnel generally.   This gives a figure of 4,000   ... 4,000Total         ............ 88,400&quot;Numbers asked for ...         ...         ... 121,600Excess   provision  if   above   Estimateadopted ...      .......*    33,200We wish to make it perfectly clear that in building up this figure of 88,400 men we have allowed the Admiralty the full number of men asked for for the fighting ships of the Navy, including 8,494 men not required afloat in Peace, but required to bring up the ships to their War Complements. We have also allowed 4,347 men in Groups II and III who would be available for other duties on the outbreak of war; so that, in effect, out of the total of 88,400 men we have provided 12,841 personnel who could be employed for crossing reliefs, training in schools, and similar duties.In addition to the 12,841 referred to above, it must be remembered that there are at all times in barracks the crews of ships refitting in the Dockyards, which will, to a large extent, be available for relief work and training of one kind and another. We look upon it as essential in. the interest of the Taxpayer that this additional personnel, held as Active Service Reserve for Mobilisation, should be effectively employed. There are many directions in which this can be done to the saving of large expense under the heading of Civilian Personnel, Harbour Ships, Coastguard, and Metropolitan Police.Further, we have based our proportionate estimate of the manning of Groups II and III on the 1914 standard. We think that the Admiralty would be able, on investigation, to adopt in these Groups a less immediate state of readiness, now that there is no German threat to fear, with reduction in personnel.It is pointed out in paragraph 8 that the Officers&apos; Servant class is one which, in our opinion, could be dispensed with in the interests of economy. In these circumstances, and in accordance with the considerations above, we do not think it too severe to recommend that the Personnel, Officers and Men should not exceed 86,600 for 1922/23 instead of the 121,600 asked for, a reduction of 35,000.In this recommendation we have taken no account of any reduction (a.) In the Fleet which the Government may decide upon as suggested in paragraph 3.(&amp;.) In the Fleet and Building Programme which the Government may contemplate as a Asult of the Washington Conference.(c.) In the standard of Manning of Ships, Shore Establishments and Retinues in Groups I, II and III which would, we have little doubt, result from a careful scrutiny. A 5 per cent, reduction would amount to a saving of about  1,000,000.We propose now to indicate a few other directions in which we consider that the Navy Estimates submitted to us have been cast on too generous a scale; but it must be obvious that these suggestions can only be taken as examples illustrating our view. . It has been impossible for us to consider exhaustively every item of expenditure; but from the following considerations we are satisfied that, besides those mentioned, there are many other ways in which striking reductions could be made.5. 1. Surplus of Officers.We were much struck by the increased ratio of officers to men between pre-war and the present time.   The following ,are the figures : Fleet  Officers.  Men.Pre-war ... ... ... ...      1 to 13Now  ... ... ... ... ...      1 to 11
Coastguard Pre-warNow  ... Marines Pre-war ... ... ... ..:      1 to 35Now  ... ... ... ... ...      1 to 29The actual increase of officers in the above Services is 417, whereas the men are about 24,000 less than pre-war; so that on the basis of the pre-war ratio there is an excess of 1,900 officers. Part of the increase is explained by the Admiralty as being required as the result of war experience and the increased complexity of modern weapons and machinery.   But even so, there is a very serious and costly surplus.Flag Officers still show the same numbers as pre-Avar, with a smaller Fleet, except that there are three additional Admirals of the Fleet, being &quot; special War Promotions.&quot;As regards &quot;Executive Officers&quot; below Flag rank, the following are the figures : Captains	August 1, 1914.	October 1, 1921.	290	343Commanders	425	555Lieut.-Commanders	699	563Lieutenants	1,170	1,642Acting Lieutenants		263Sub-Lieutenants	327	354Midshipmen	401	517	3,312	4,237This table shows an increase with a smaller Navy of 925 Executive Officers.A similar surplus applies in the case of the &quot; Engineer &quot; Offices. It is not necessary to elaborate this point, but we do recommend that it should receive immediate treatment. A surplus of officers cannot but lead to increased expendi-ture in a Service, and the matter should be dealt with even though the remedy may result in a considerable increase of the Non-Effective Vote. We will refer to this point in relation to all three Fighting Services at a later stage. At the same time, we recommend that the Admiralty should not bring back officers temporarily from the unemployed and half-pay lists on to the full pay list, with the result of preventing them, from being retired for non-service.6. .2. High Commands, Staffs and Retinues.We suggest that the Admiralty should consider whether it is not possible to abolish certain High Commands which existed during the war, but which appear to us to have now lost their significance. Such Commands, involving large charges for staff and accommodation, appear only to be justified when a large number of ships or men are located in the area of the&quot; Commander-in-Chief. We do not think that any such justification exists in the case of the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Scotland, which. Command, we suggest, might be amalgamated with the Nore Command, as before the war. Further, we recommend that the post of Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, should be abolished, being absorbed in the Command of the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.We deal under Vote 8 with the question of reducing Gibraltar Dockyard to a skeleton organisation, and, if that is effected, we think that there would be no need to retain the Rear-Admiral who is now in charge of Gibraltar and who also acts as Admiral Superintendent of the Dockyard.We are by no means satisfied that for all practical purposes the whole Command ashore in this country could not be exercised by one Commander-in-Chief, and we suggest that there should be a special investigation into this point, especially having regard to the reductions in personnel recommended. We do recognise, however, that the popularity of a Service requires a few positions of dignity, and it may be that three High Commands ashore in this country are called for on that account.   Whether one or more, however, is retained, the cost of Staff and Retinues,Officers. -Men.1 to 10 1 to 6
and scale of allowances, provision of motor cars- and boats, should be drastically reduced. The cost of the five Home Commands, exclusive of free houses, is  214,000, and details are given in Appendix (F), 1, 2 and 3. We invite particular attention to these Appendices. (F) 1 gives details of the Retinues. These appear unjustifiable, and we do not think that the country should be asked to provide them on any such scale. In addition to these Retinues, allowances in lieu of domestic servants are paid varying from  375 to  750 a year. The analysis of cost given in Appendix (F) 2 shows that with a salary of  2,500 over  3,000 is drawn in allowances made in cash and not subject to Income Tax. Roughly, a staff of about 20 officers, costing  17,000 per annum, has a Retinue costing slightly more to wait upon it. We suggest that an economy in such a matter &quot; at the top of the Service &quot; would set an example for similar economies elsewhere.7. 3. Shore Establishments.We have considered the numbers of officers and men borne as the peace complements of shore establishments at Home and abroad, and are impressed with the fact that, with a smaller Navy, the peace complements have grown from 1,102 officers in 1914 to 1,451 officers in 1922/23. The Naval ratings have increased in the same period from 8,557 to 10,423 an increase of 2,215 officers and men, or 23 per cent. Details at each Port are given in Appendix (G). There is a further significant fact in connection with these establishments to which attention should be called. Before the war, large numbers of the shore establishments were earmarked as available for active service on mobilisation, e.g., out of the total of 1,102 officers and 8,557 men in 1914, 507 officers and 4,135 men were shown as available on mobilisation. Now, however, the Admiralty regard these increased numbers as a permanent requirement for these shore establishments either in peace or war, and they do not show any officers or men as available on mobilisation; in spite of the 23 per cent, increase in the establishments and the reduction in the Navy. We consider this as an illustration of the lavish way in which man power is employed.8. 4- Officers&apos; Stewards and Cooks.We also suggest that the Admiralty should give attention to the numbers of Officers&apos; Stewards and Cooks. These men are entered as Naval ratings. We are aware that special posts are assigned to them when the ship is &quot; in action,&quot; but we understand that their numbers are not dictated by the requirements &quot; in action,&quot; but by what is considered to be a reasonable scale of servants for normal times, and they are in fact professional &quot;domestics.&quot; The Admiralty have supplied us with the following details, and we feel that the numbers of Stewards and Cooks allotted to the Ward Room Mess, the Gun Room Mess and the Warrant Officers&apos; Mess on a sliding scale, according to the size of the Mess, are not inappropriate. : The following table, however, shows the number of Officers&apos; Stewards and Cooks authorised for Flag Officers, Commodores and Commanding Officers : 	Admiral.	Vice-Admiral.	Rear Admiral.	Commodore, 1st class.Officers&apos; chief steward or officers&apos; steward 				1st class	1	1	1	1Officers&apos; steward 				1st class	2	1	1	,12nd class	5	3	1	-    1Officers&apos; chief cook or officers&apos; cook 				1st class	1	1	1	1Officers&apos; cook 				2nd class ..	1 &apos;   . &apos;	1	1	1Total   ..	10	7	5	5

In 1914, such servants cost  255,000; in 1921,  733,000 per annum.In addition to the scale of servants which is allowed, we would also point out that, in any case where an officer is resident on shore and does not enjoy the services, or partial services, of servants provided at the public expense, he receives servants&apos; allowance at rates varying from  750 down to  13 10s. per annum. The total expenditure on these allowances at the present time is at the rate of  70,500 per annum, and the total number of officers in receipt of servants&apos; allowance has risen from 110 in 1914 to 1,500 at the present time.We suggest that the whole question be reconsidered and that the Officers&apos; Servant class should be abolished, the Army practice of one servant per Senior Officer, drawn from the fighting personnel of the unit being adopted.Officers required &quot;to mess alone at sea might, in addition, have whole or part-time service of a cook.We think that allowances in lieu of servants should be restricted to pre-war practice and subject in any case to a maximum as for one servant.9. ,5. Yachts a,nd Special Service Vessels.We have considered the expenses incurred in the manning, maintenance and &quot;unning of the two Royal Yachts, &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; and &quot;Alexandra,&quot; the Admiralty Yacht &quot;Enchantress,&quot; and two Yachts termed &quot;Special Service&quot; /essels, viz., &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Alacrity,&quot; which are at the disposal of the Commanders-in-Chief, Mediterranean and China respectively. The following table shows the cost of manning, maintenance and running the Royal Yachts and the Admiralty Yacht: 1921/22 (Estimate). &quot;   &apos;     -&apos;&apos; Victoria and Albert&quot;... ... ...      118,200&quot;Alexandra&quot; ... ... ...       71,375&quot;Enchantress&quot;     .     .... ... ...       81,700We suggest that, in existing financial circumstances, subject, of course, to His ^ajesty&apos;s approval, the Royal Yacht &quot; Victoria and Albert &quot; should be reduced to Care and Maintenance status in the winter months, unless His Majesty desires to use her, and the Royal Yacht &quot; Alexandra &quot; should be* disposed of.We also suggest that the Admiralty Yacht &quot;Enchantress&quot; should be disposed of.As regards the &quot;Special Service&quot; vessels, &quot;Surprise&quot; and &quot;Alacrity,&quot; these are really Yachts and have complements of 107 and 126 officers and men respectively, and wre recommend that they should be sold.10. ...... 6.. Hospital Ships.We observe that the Admiralty have now two Hospital Ships, &quot;Berbice &quot; and &apos;.- Maine.&quot; The latter was bought early  this year and is now being refitted. Before whe war, the Admiralty had only one Flospital Ship.   We suggest, therefore, that
either &quot;Berbice&quot; or &quot;Maine&quot; should be retained, the decision depending upon whichever is the more economical combined with efficiency, and whichever can best be disposed of.11. 7. Coastgtiard..We find that the increase in Coastguard Officers is particularly high, viz., 68 per cent. This increase includes, of course, Warrant Officers, of whom there is a large surplus on the active list. The officers in the Coastguard Service have increased from 293 in 1914 to 492. This is certainly a method of employing Officers and Warrant Officers, but we are not satisfied that the Coastguard, as proposed, is necessary or economical. Before the war there were 3,130 officers and men in this service, of whom 1,100 joined their ships on mobilisation. Now, of the 3,250, none will join their ships on mobilisation. Here we have an instance in previous practice of what we advocate, namely, that men for Active Service complements on mobilisation should perform other duties in peace, but the Admiralty have reversed the policy, and over 1,000 men extra are provided for.The following stations are manned by the Coastguard : 1. Coastguard stations    .. .. .. ..   4192. War signal stations   .. .. .. 158 (of these 45 are closedin peace).3. W/T stations.. .. .. ., 204. Direction-finding stations .. .. ..       6 (2 not manned).5. Sound-ranging stations .. .. ..       2 (1       ,,       ).Of the 419 Coastguard stations, 144 are frankly not required by the Admiralty for their own purposes. The Admiralty have recently arranged to close 16 by agreement with the Board of Customs and Excise and the Board of Trade. This still leaves 128 which the Navy say they do not require for their own purposes. We recommend that the Board of Customs, Board of Trade and the Post Office, who are primarily concerned in these stations, should reconsider them and suggest a further reduction. Even so, there will still be 275 Coastguard stations doing heterogeneous duty for the above-mentioned and other Government Departments, Trinity House and Lloyd&apos;s, with a small amount of Naval work in the form of reports to the Hydrographer and recruiting for the Navy. We do not consider that these Coastguard stations have sufficient justification from the Naval point of view, and we think that the onus probandi must be laid upon the other Departments of the Government, and that they should meantime be strongly pressed to reduce these stations to the barest minimum,.unless a serious loss to revenue, due to smuggling, is to be apprehended; and if they require them the cost involved should be noted on their Estimates.The War Signal Stations maintain communication between the Admiralty and ships at sea, by visual signalling only, and carry out &quot; Intelligence Duties.&quot; We are of opinion that there would be very little risk incurred if all these stations were closed in peace time, especially if the 20 W/T Stations and the Direction-finding and Sound-ranging Stations which are now manned are retained.12. Vote 2. Victualling and Clothing.1913/14 Audited Expenditure ... -       ...      3,034,246 1921/22 Net Estimate ... ... ...      7,821,0001922/23 Net Estimate ... ... ...      7,014,400We recommend that, in view of falling prices, the Admiralty should, for the present, live on their stocks of victualling and clothing stores and should proceed on the basis that stocks of such stores, which can readily be obtained in the commercial market in an emergency, should not exceed three months&apos; war consumption of the Fleet, instead of the six months&apos; stock they are now holding.We would point out that if the reduction of active service officers and men, as suggested in the previous paragraphs, are effected, a great saving on this Vote should be possible, combining reduced consumption with absorption of stock. We think that in all three Fighting Services, the clothing allowances should be reduced by one-third, so that the uniformed forces should, like civilians, economise in their clothes, but it should be definitely understood that the standard of repair of uniform is correspondingly lowered, so that the men do not suffer. In the case of the Navy this would mean  500,000 per annum. All allowances have, we understand, been revised to meet current prices, and subsequent revisions should give effect not only to falling prices, but to the extended life suggested.[7348] D
13. Vote 3. Medical Establishments.The cost of educating Cadets at Dartmouth lias much impressed us, and we understand that the Admiralty are about to hold a special enquiry into the matter, j We find that, without making any allowance for capital expenditure on the college buildings, the annual cost of a Cadet at Dartmouth, including the cost of nautical training, is  462.  WTe consider that this figure is much too high in comparison with Public Schools, and should be reduced by  150.   We think this should be possible having regard to the fact that for 445 Cadets there &quot;is a total staff of 529, which includes 41 teachers and 43 officers.  The scale of fees at present charged to parents is incommensurate even with such reduced cost.   The ordinary scale is  75 a year, with a reduced scale of  40 in favour of the sons of Naval and Military Officers or j civilians serving at the Admiralty.   The fees average  66 a year.   If the fees were j doubled there would be a saving to the State of  29,370 per annum.  The Admiralty are, we understand, considering whether thev should raise the fees to  112 10s. al year, but we think even that amount unreasonably low.   In our opinion, the ordinary I scale of fees should be more in keeping with the cost to the State and should be  150 I a year, on the assumption that the cost is brought down to  312, with a reduced scale I for the sons of officers of the Fighting Services.  We suggest that there should be a J limited number of scholarships or bursaries for boys whose parents are of slender! means and who show marked ability by some prescribed test. -   I1913/14 Audited Expenditure   ... ...      281,3821921/22 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      720,5001922/23 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      625,000This Vote, which does not include the Naval Medical Personnel borne on Vote 1, is more than double pre-war in amount, but it is significant that medical and dental services for the Navy, which must necessarily be composed of men of a high standard of physical efficiency, cost, when the salaries of personnel on Vote 1 are included, roughly  12 per head. This appears to us to be an unduly high figure, but we have no individual items to comment on. We would, however, point out that in view of the present high costs, everything possible should be done to combine the medical facilities on shore of the three Fighting Services, a matter in which very little has been effected hitherto. The reduced numbers of Naval personnel which we have suggested would affect this Vote. We will, however, deal with the cost of medical services generally under the Army Estimates.14. Vote 4.-Civilians Employed on Fleet Services.1914/15 Audited Expenditure   ... ...      176,9771921/22 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      389,0001922/23 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      300,000We observe under sub-heads (A) and (B) of this Vote, a number of salaried and wage-earning civilians engaged on duties which we think might be undertaken by Naval ratings or Marines, who have to be retained in any case for manning the Fleet on mobilisation. We note that civilians are employed in the Naval Barracks, on rifle ranges, in Training Establishments, at the Submarine Depot and in detention-tion Quarters in various capacities, such as signallers, telephone operators, postmen, markers, caretakers, messengers, porters, sports groundsmen and mess attendants. As we have already suggested, these functions and those of the civilian crews on Naval ferry steamers, yard craft, Fleet service tugs, and, indeed, on all craft employed by the Navy to-day, manned by civilians, might be undertaken by active service ratings who are on shore waiting to fill up &quot; complements&quot; on mobilisation, or to supply new drafts for ships re-commissioning. We think that by a system of rotation these men could undertake these duties in the intervals between courses of instruction.   On mobilisation they would, of course, require to be replaced.. 15.

This is exclusive of items amounting to  1,300,000 charged to other Votes. The other items which have chiefly struck us are-(a.) The numbers of dockyards at home and abroad.(b.) The numbers of men employed in the dockyards.(c.) The high ratio of the wages bill to the material consumed.(d.) The numbers of yard craft and men employed in manning them.(e.) Dockyard police.The following are our comments and recommendations : (a.) Numbers of Dockyards. iThe number of dockyards is admittedly excessive, and we recommend that the reduction should not be confined to the present proposals of the Admiralty that Haulbowline should be closed and Pembroke gradually reduced. We suggest that Pembroke also^ should be closed, and that Gibraltar should be reduced, retaining only a skeleton organisation, capable of expansion in the event of war. The present cost of Gibraltar Dockyard is  355,000 per annum, and we suggest that it should be put on a Care and Maintenance basis with a consequent large saving.We are further of opinion that Naval exigencies do not now require both Rosyth and Chatham at their present size, and we consider that their combined capacity should be reduced in the most economical way, since the strategic position which dictated their full retention no longer obtains.We also suggest that the Admiralty should reconsider the question whether the. naval establishment at Wei-hai Wei is sufficiently useful to justify the annual cost of  25,450. We understand that its present use is for the purposes of recreation and of minor repairs to ships and targets, and it requires a certain number of British or Indian troops for its protection.(b.) Number of Men.The number of men employed in the Royal Dockyards before the war, at home and abroad, was 50,350; now it is 59,341, an increase of 9,000.We see difficulty in accepting numbers which are in excess of the year 1914, and having regard to the greatly decreased number of fighting ships in all states of readiness, compared with pre-war (viz., a decrease of 194), we cannot believe that itT7348] D 21913/14 Audited Expenditure    ... ...       53,3751921/22 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      449,0001922/23 Net Estimate   ... ... ...      400,000We observe that there is a decrease of  49,000, but would point out that in 1913/14 the total expenditure was only  53,000.We have learned from the First Lord the very great value which he attaches to this branch of Naval expenditure, and we are duly appreciative of its importance. We feel that, if the country could afford it, probably the whole of the expenditure in this connection would be justified, but we are of opinion that in present circum-stances some reduction must be made, and we suggest that the sum of  400,000 net should be reduced to  200,000 net, which is four times what it was in 1913/14.
is necessary? for the Royal Navy to maintain these men in the dockyards, To have a surplus of men with a deficiency of work must lead to high costs,(c.) High Ratio of Wages Bill to Material Used.&quot;We are much impressed by a comparison of the high cost of labour in the dockyards in proportion to the value of material consumed. An average of all the home dockyards shows us that  3 is paid in wages for every pound&apos;s worth of material consumed, whereas in private shipyards and repair yards doing Naval repair and construction work, the comparable figures on such work are only  1 10s. in wages for every  1 of material. This basis of comparison, though rough and ready, is generally accepted as a sound one. This confirms what is so of fen stated  that the Royal Dockyards are uneconomical.The country cannot afford to have its Admiralty work carried out at these rates, and, in our opinion, it should be clearly intimated that unless costs can be brought down by economical output and management, Admiralty work will have to be sent elsewhere.We understand that in the Royal Dockyards no piece-work rates are in operation, although they are common practice in private yards.(d.) Numbers of Yard Craft and Men.The numbers of yard craft and the wages of yard-craft men show a very striking increase. In the year 1914/15, these wages amounted to  67,530; for the year 1921/22 they are  325,800, or an increase of 382 per cent. Whereas in 1914/15 there were 574 yard-craft men for the home yards, there are now 1,070. The increase is mainly due to additional craft, and we think it is unjustifiable. In view of the reduction of ships since 1914, we think that the number of yard craft should be brought down to the 1914 basis adjusted to the numbers and size of the Fleet as compared with pre-war ; and, as we have already pointed out, we suggest that these craft should be manned in peace time, save in so far as specialists are required, by active service ratings in the Depots, who will be required for the War Fleet on mobilisation.(e.) Dockyard Police.The system of guarding Naval establishments undertaking Fire Brigade duties, &amp;c, by means of the Metropolitan Police seems to us to be entirely wrong, and the cost excessive. In wages and uniform alone, the cost is now  539,693 compared with  173,380 pre-war. The numbers are now 1,665 as compared with 1,347 before the war. The present total cost to the State for each policeman may be put at  400 per annum. From information which we have received, we are satisfied that these men are employed by the Admiralty in numbers largely in excess of what is required for purely police duties, and we recommend that the whole question should be gone into by the Admiralty with the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, with a view to arranging that Metropolitan Police be employed only in such numbers as the Commissioner considers necessary for detection of crime, and that all duties of watching, gate guarding, fire brigade work and sentry duty, including conducting visitors round the dockyards, should be carried out by active service Marines or Naval ratings retained for mobilisation of the War Fleet. We have evidence of wasteful employment of Metropolitan Police which will be entirely checked if the above suggestions are adopted. Since we interviewed the Admiralty representatives and the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, we have learnt that at Chatham alone it has been found possible to dispense with 2 Chief Inspectors, 1 Inspector, 3 Sergeants, and 56 Police Constables.Motor transport.The total stock of Mechanical Transport Vehicles held by the Admiralty is 481, compared with 11 in 1914. Details are given in Appendix (H). Included in this total are 75 passenger motor cars, compared with none in 1914.The Admiralty explain that the practice as to transport has been completely changed, and they claim that economy and efficiency has resulted. They are not in a position, however, to show figures proving the case.
In view of the reduction in the size of the Navy and the consequent falling off in Dockyard work, we feel that the additional expenditure now proposed, viz.,  35,400, on new vehicles and  20,500 on reconditioning should not be spent, and further that careful cost figures should be worked up and the stock of vehicles reviewed by the Treasury in the light of that information.We cannot see any case for the retention of 75 cars as against none in 1914, and suggest that the cars be sold, unless in any case, such as the 13 Naval cars in Berlin, the Admiralty can convince the Treasury that it is more economical than hiring or travelling by rail.Fuel for the Fleet. .We have considered the programme contemplated by the Admiralty for accumulating reserves of oil fuel and have come to the conclusion that, having regard to the Cabinet&apos;s pronouncement, considerable savings under this head might be possible; but,&apos; as obviously the question of the fuel reserves of the Navy is a matter of high policy, we refrain from discussing it in this report,Naval Stores.Finally, there is an important item, viz., Naval Stores. We understand that, except in the case of those articles, like hemp and timber, which require lengthy seasoning, the Admiralty policy is to maintain a stock equal to six months&apos; consump-tion of the War Fleet.&apos; We recommend that, as in the case-of the Clothing and Victualling Stores, apart from the special articles mentioned above, the stock of all stores which can be readily obtained in the commercial market in an emergency, should be reduced to a three months&apos; war consumption supply.18.

It is not possible to sub-divide each item according to the main description of the stores, owing to the fact that the items for wages are not allocated, but reviewing the totals as a whole, we are much impressed with some of the items of expenditure proposed. These items are not only very large in themselves, but have to be increased by a proportion of the salaries/ allowances and wages of the workpeople employed on them and by the indirect cost which they involve in the form of inspection, proof and storage.(i.) As regards guns, the cost of manufacture alone is estimated at  1,148,550. The major part of this expenditure is a sum of  810,000 for guns for the new Capital Ships. Further, there is an item of  60,000 for reconditioning reserves of 2,000 guns and mountings for the defensive armament of merchant ships, with an annual charge of  6,000 for maintenance and storage. We suggest that this item should be carefully reconsidered, as in our opinion no disadvantage would ensue if this work were retarded. *(ii.) As regards projectiles and ammunition (estimated to cost  1,800,000), the largest item is for the manufacture of shell for the larger guns of Capital Ships. The expenditure under&apos; this head alone accounts for some  800,000. It is admitted that of this type of shell the ships already hold one complete &quot; outfit &quot; on board, and there is half an &quot; outfit &quot; ashore. This means that half an outfit &quot; is still required to complete the authorised reserve. The Admiralty propose practically to complete this reserve during the coming financial year, but having regard to the existing stock of this particular ammunition we are of opinion that the completion of the full establishment could be spread over a longer period.Apart from this new type of shell, it is proposed to spend  1,000,000 on other ammunition, and we think that this is susceptible of great reduction in view of the large surplus stocks of ammunition which are held in excess of the authorised reserves. We are informed that in the four years of the war, the Navy fired only half an outfit out of the three outfits which were then authorised. At this rate of expenditure, the two and a half outfits which remain are equivalent to 20 years
consumption on the basis of the late War, and yet it is proposed next year to spend close on  2,000,000 on ammunition alone.(iii.) The Admiralty propose in 1922/23 to spend the sum of  284,000 on the manufacture and repair of torpedoes. This work will be done at the Eoyal Naval Torpedo Factory, Greenock, which employs 850 men. The proposed output of new torpedoes, viz., one a week, is about equal to the annual wastage due to loss. We desire to point out, however, that the stock of 21-in. torpedoes held by the Admiralty is 5,449, valued at approximately  10,000,000, and they have also a stock of 3,058 torpedoes of an older type, which they are keeping in a state of preservation, and which represent a cost of, say,  4,500,000.Having regard to the large stocks held and the expense in storage, we consider that the rate of manufacture of new torpedoes could for the present be reduced.(iv.) In the case of cordite, as of torpedoes, the Admiralty are manufacturing at the rate of 1,500 tons a year, which covers their practice expenditure and wastage for age. The present stock is about 11,000 tons and the Admiralty propose to increase this stock to 13,000 tons. In view of the present circumstances and the short life of cordite, we think the stock should be reduced.19. Vote 10.

In the total figure of  4,756,000, there is a sum of  1,344,000 for the annuity under Naval Works Acts, which is incapable of reduction. This leaves about  3,400,000 to be otherwise accounted for. Of this sum,  1,000,000 is for the provision of oil storage ;  2,000,000 is for the continuation of works already started, repairs, maintenance and dredging, &amp;c.; and  340,000 is in respect of new works, other than oil fuel storage, not yet commenced.The provision of oil storage is a matter of high policy, with which we have refrained from dealing throughout our Report, and we have no doubt that the Government may wish to reconsider whether this expenditure, in whole or in part, cannot be deferred.As regards the remainder, we think that the  2,000,000 which is allocated for continuation works, maintenance and dredging (this latter item amounts to nearly  300,000) should be cut down to  1,000,000, and that the  340,000 for new works should be entirely deferred. We are of opinion that the amount proposed for dredging could be very much reduced if the number of craft is curtailed and if Naval personnel were used to the fullest possible extent in manning the dredgers.20.

There seems to us to be no sufficient reason why the Government should give this concession which they did not give before the war.2. Cost of the Water Police, viz.,  30,750. Pre-war the cost was  9,644. The numbers now employed are 2 Inspectors, 16 Sergeants and 81 Constables, an increase of 23 over 1914, due to the establishment of Rosyth (20) and an increase at Portsmouth (3). We have already suggested that this work should be done by active service ratings who are necessarily retained for mobilisation, and the Metropolitan &quot;Water Police should all be released.

We do not consider that the reduction should be so long delayed, and we are not satisfied that the present reduction in numbers is sufficiently reflected in the reduction, of cost. We suggest that by a continuous process of reduction the staff should come down during next year to the pre-war number, any new branch of work since 1914 being offset by the smaller numbers of Naval personnel and ships. We also suggest that the overtaking of arrears on less important matters should, if necessary, be slowed down and that the Vote, including officers borne on Vote 1, should be reduced to not more than  1,000,000. We are convinced that a large staff at the Admiralty itself tends to create high cost and big establishments elsewhere.22. Vote 13.

This subject is one which also affects the Army and the Royal Air Force, and we refer to it separately at the conclusion of our reports on the Fighting Services.23. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of the opinion: (1.) That the Estimates for 1922/23 provide for man-power on a lavish scale, and that without in any way interfering either with the manning of the fighting ships of the Navy, from Capital Ships to Submarines, as laid down by the Admiralty, there is an excess of over 33,000 officers and men in the Navy which, having regard to our recommendations in para-graph 8 respecting officers&apos; servants class, would justify a reduction of 35,000 officers and men.(2.) That the Admiralty, with a smaller Navy, are maintaining far larger shore establishments, both Naval and Civilian, than they did before the War, and we think that there are many ways in which economies could be effected by employing the Naval Ratings and Marines held for mobilisation on the work now done for the Admiralty by civilians and Metropolitan Police.(3.) That the great increase in expenditure and activity in educational estab-lishments, in Research and Experiment, and in training of all kinds, should be brought more within the limits of our reduced resources, and that the Royal Dockyards are so expensive that unless their costs can be brought more nearly to a commercial level, the work sent there should be greatly reduced.(4.) That the Naval Estimates for 1922/23 should be reduced from  81,000,000 to  60,000,000 for that year, and that in the subsequent year still lower Estimates should suffice.(5.) That a judicious substitution of air-power ought to result in a further reduction of the Navy Estimates,* A-sum of  136,000 should be added for Naval officers borne on Vote 1 and employed at the Admiralty.
In these recommendations no account is taken of large savings which might result from the proposals arising out of the Washington Conference, such as the discontinuance of the construction of the four new Capital Ships, for which the Estimates for 1922/23 include  11,800,000; nor of a possible reduction of the number of Capital and other ships in full or partial commission; nor of any consequential savings in connection with the provision of Oil Storage and accumulation of Oil Stocks.No account has been taken of any reduction in pay and allowances which the Government may decide to make, and no account is taken of any abnormal increase in the Non-Effective&apos; Vote, caused by a reduction of the personnel transferred to the Petired List, with both of which items we deal separately in a later Report.

Very incorrect conclusions may be deduced by the non-technical mind from these figures. It might, for instance, be argued that Great Britain is equal in strength at the moment to the combined navies of United States and Japan, whereas this is by no means the case.Firstly, the United States have included in their 20, 3 post-Jutland ships, whereas Great Britain and Japan have only 1.Secondly, the 20 ships of the United States are all battleships, whereas the 30 of Great Britain consist of 22 battleships and 8 battle cruisers. The latter include &quot; Hood,&quot; but two of them are obsolete (viz., &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand &quot;), 2 others are rapidly becoming so, and the other 4, with the exception of the &quot; Hood,&quot; are very weakly armoured.It is almost impossible to assess the relative strength of battleships and battle cruisers : battle cruisers are necessarily of inferior fighting power, since they
sacrifice guns and armour to speed : this is especially the case in our 7 pre-Jutland battle cruisers. If the battleship fleet be alone considered, the figures are as follows: Great Britain. United States. Japan.22 20 6Thirdly, an important point in assessing the. strengths of the number of ships in commission and reserve: Great Britain has in full commission 13 battleships and 3 battle cruisers against the United States&apos; 18 battleships, necessitating 14 British Capital Ships being in reserve. Ships in reserve deteriorate more rapidly than ships in commission, and consideration should be given for this fact in comparing strengths.From this it will be seen that whereas Great Britain has 30 ships in existence&apos; to the 20 of the United States, their relative fighting strengths are in a very different proportion. Moreover, of far more serious consideration is the fact that our present numbers and our present fighting strength is the maximum that we can attain until we have completed the 4 new &quot;Replacement&quot; ships that have been approved; whereas, the figures of 20 and 10, respectively, for the United States and Japan show them at their minimum strength, and a strength which is increasing steadily and rapidly month by month.If we assume that Great Britain is only of slightly inferior strength in ships in full commission compared with the United States at the moment, we have yet to face the fact that our 14 ships in reserve are all we shall have for the next three years to meet the 15 post-Jutland ships that she will be steadily adding to her fleet.The figures shown at the. beginning of this Memorandum for Japan may be equally misleading as those for the United States. Japan is also on the threshold of completing several more post-Jutland ships, which will bring her strength up to 17 by 1924 and 25 in 1928 if her intended building programme is not curtailed.To sum up, therefore, the position is as follows : At the moment, Great Britain is at the summit of her Naval strength and cannot alter her position for at least three years; the United States and Japan are at the threshold of completing their new navies. The battleship strength of Great Britain and the United States at the present time is approximately equal if anything, the balance is in favour of the United States while next year she will receive an addition of at least 3 post-Jutland battleships.&apos; In addition to the materiel question, the personnel aspect must be borne in mind. The numbers of personnel for Great Britain and the United States are as follows : Great Britain. &apos;  United States.113,350* 133,300Great Britain, to man her ships on mobilisation, therefore, has to draw to a much larger extent on Reservists than the United States have to do. This is important as affecting efficiency and relative fighting strength.October 24, 1921.* Excluding Coastguard, naval cadets and boys under training, none of whom are available for manning the Fleet and are not included in the American figures.[734SJF, 2

There are no ships in &quot; reserve&quot; as we understand the term. Ships are either in commission in the sea-going fleets, or are at home ports with full crews on board and ready for sea at short notice.company CO
APPENDIX (El).Admiralty Memorandum on &quot;Manning&quot; the Fleet.The dominating factor in settling the numbers of officers and men required to be borne is the size of the War Fleet, which is the list of actual ships allocated for carrying out the responsibilities of the Admiralty in the event of war.The Fleet is actually maintained in Peace on a different basis from what is required in War. In War, all the ships must be completed to full crews either by Active Service ratings or with a proportion of Naval Reserves entered on mobilisa-tion, according to the purpose for which and the urgency with which the particular vessel would be required in case of emergency. In Peace, only a certain portion of the total War Fleet is kept in full commission, and, the remainder are on reduced bases differing in status according to their position in the War Fleet.The following table shows the differences of status which exist in Peace in their relation to the War Fleet: Status in Peace,(i.) Full crews active service, (ii.) Half crews        ,, (iii.) In reserve, crews varying from one-fifth to one-tenth of full numbers.(iv.) Harbour establishments, schools, barracks, &amp;c, permanent comple-ments, instructors, experimental parties and care of establishments.Status in War.(i.) Full crews active service, (ii.)(iii.) Two-fifths crews active service, balance naval reserves entered on mobilisation.(iv.) Harbour establishments reduced in varying degrees, on account of certain duties which lapse in war.It is obvious that the difference between Peace and War for (ii) and (iii) above and the whole of (iv) in Peace will be in harbour or on shore in Peace time, yet none could be dispensed with without prejudicing their ultimate disposal in War time.The difference between Peace and War for (ii) and (iii) provides a working margin for the Fleet during Peace. Men must be passed through the Training Schools, travel to and from Foreign Stations and have leave, and there must always be a margin for sickness. For instance, the relief of crews on Foreign Stations entails a working margin of 3,000, which is found out of the difference between Peace and War requirements for (ii) and (iii).It does not follow that a reduction in the numbers of ships in &quot; full commission &quot; would necessarily reduce the numbers of Naval personnel. It depends to what status the ships would be reduced, and this must depend on the purpose for which and the urgency with which the particular vessels would be required in case of emergency.If, in the event of an emergency, the reduced ships have to be restored to corn-mission with full active service crews, obviously the crews would have to be kept available, and therefore there could not Be any reduction.If ships reduced from &quot; full commission &quot; were scrapped and sold out of the Service, there would then be a reduction in personnel equal to the requirements of the scrapped ships.Intermediately between the above two situations in dealing with a paid-off ship, there are an indefinite number of positions at which the status of such paid-off ships could be fixed, each producing a different result on the personnel.

NOTES.1. In 1914/15 the Coastguard was an Active Service force, of whom some embarked in ships on Mobilisation.   Now it is a Pensioner force, and none embark. 2. Included in the   Margin, &amp;c,&quot; for 1921/22 are nearly 700 Officers who are surplus to present requirements, and who will eventually disappear.3. The figures for 1914/15 are not exactly equal to the Vote of the period.   The balance consisted of a round number of ratings taken in advance for training, covering all classes of new construction of which there is no record in detail.There is a similar item in the 1921/22 figures for the new Capital Ships, but it is included under the head of &quot; Battleships.&quot; A Of4. The &quot;Air Service&quot; in 1914/15 included 1,000 air ratings.   In 1921/22 the figure is all for aircraft carriers.5. As regards Harbour Establishments at home in 1914/15, nearly all the Schools. &amp;c, were shut up on Mobilisation, their crews being drafted to sea. It was found necessary to reopen them during the war, and accordingly orders were issued, after the war, to keep all Schools, &amp;c\, open. * Consequently, no one in the complements of these establishments would have been available for sea on Mobilisation. This rule was modified in 1921/22 Estimates to the exteut of embarking 1,000 from these establishments. It has since been approved to embark, on Mobilisation, 3,500 from Harbour Complements.6. The Section &quot; Miscellaneous&quot; in 1921/22 is not quite on the same lines as in 1914/15. A few tenders now shown as Miscellaneous were shown under &quot; Harbour Ships&quot; in 1914/15, but it would take a very long time to extract the details, which are mixed up with numerous establishments.CO COro

Chapter II.ARMY ESTIMATES. 1922/23.The provisional Army Estimate which has been presented to us for 1922/23 compares with the 1914/15 figure, after the Aviation expenditure for that year is deducted, as follows : Net Estimate   1914/15      ............      27,845,000*1922/23      ... ... ... ...      78,134,800(Less  2,937,000 for aftermath charges.)Eor details of these Estimates see Appendix (A), and for a comparison between 1922/23 and 1921/22 see Appendix (B).tIt will be seen that we are to-day considering Estimates for an Army, including the Middle East, approaching three times the Estimate of 1914/15.As regards the numbers in the Army, comparing 1922/23 with 1914/15, the comparison may be taken as follows : 1914/15(excluding R.F.C.). 1922/23.All ranks, British, native and colonial troops ... ... 181,0001        210,000t.so that there is a material increase both in cost and numbers, and this applies both to officers and men, and to British as well as to native troops.The units also from the point of view of fighting efficiency are far more powerful than they were in 1914/15. Owing to the introduction of machine-guns, the fire-power of an infantry battalion is given as six to eight times as much as it was before the war, and that of a cavalry regiment, four times as much as it was before the war. The introduction of heavy artillery, gas and tanks has increased the fighting-power out of all comparison with the number of men engaged, and officers, who are intended to increase the efficiency of the army, have increased disproportionately to the men. Moreover, there has been added to the defence force of the Empire the very costly and highly specialised arm of the Air. There will therefore be a far more powerful Army than we had before the war.As, before the war, we have certain overseas obligations and we have not only to provide the garrisons to meet those obligations, but also to provide drafts and reliefs for the battalions, cavalry regiments and other units overseas, as also the depots for the recruiting and training of those forces. We had also an obligation to place six divisions, fully equipped and trained, on a European battlefield in the event of an emergency arising. That obligation has gone, and we are now only confronted .. with the task of maintaining our overseas garrisons, the possibility of minor III expeditions upon which we may have to embark during the next ten years, and the maintenance of order at home.(In the Departmental Estimates submitted to us, and in our consideration of them, a normal condition of affairs in Ireland has been assumed.)2.   We have considered the nation&apos;s overseas obligations as far as possible.   The * following table shows the garrisons for 1914/15, and the garrisons covered by the Estimates for 1922/23, together with the Committee&apos;s suggestions thereon, which are amplified in the following paragraphs.* Excluding  1,000,000 provided for Aviation.f The headings of Appendix (A) and Appendix (B) vary because the form of Army Accounts lias been varied.f These figures are exclusive of British troops stationed in India and paid for by that country. The numbers of these for 1914/15 are 75,824 and 1922/23 70,980.

Reduction 28 Batts.	NOTES.(a) Aden, formerly on the Indian Establishment, is being transferred to the Middle East. (6) The reductions of 4 Regiments from 31 to 27 has already been announced, but not yet carried out. (c) At these stations a small reserve for eventualities in the Middle East or elsewhere is provided, in addition to the requirements of purely local defence.As shown above, India has relinquished a cavalry regiment and 6 infantry battalions, and South Africa and Mauritius have relinquished 5 infantry battalions and 2 cavalry regiments. The War Office have, upon demobilisation 1 extra infantry battalion, giving them in their own hands 12 additional infantry battalions in all, and these they have retained. These 12 infantry battalions they propose to use in the following way : 6 in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Constantinople.2 additional in Egypt.. 1 at Singapore.3 in the Home Establishments^The 9 battalions abroad mean under the &quot; Car dwell&quot; system 9 link battalions at home and 9 depots.It will therefore be seen that the reduction of 11 battalions in India and Africa not only affords no relief to the Taxpayer, but increases his burden, because the 6 battalions from India were paid for by India and are now transferred to the British Taxpayer.Units on foreign service are relieved by a system known as the &quot; Car dwell System,&quot; which has been in force for over fifty years. This system provides broadly that for each infantry battalion and each cavalry regiment abroad there shall be a similar unit at home. This linked unit at home provides the drafts for the foreign service unit and eventually relieves it when the foreign service unit comes home. Behind these linked units, again, there are depots which recruit and give preliminary training to the raw recruit.The War Office hold the view that this is the most economical way of providing for the alternation of foreign service and home service, and on the assumption that* Germany is regarded as in the Home Establishments.
the number of units which this system gives at home is needed either at home, or as an Expeditionary Force, that may be so. But if there is no real necessity for the full number of units at home, the system cannot, in our opinion, be an economical one, and so far as our information goes, there is no need for 6 divisions, complete in all arms and services, to be held either for the maintenance of order in this country or for any emergency abroad which is likely to arise in the next few years.Hitherto there have been undoubted conveniences, and in certain circumstances economies, in the Cardwell System, but clearly we cannot afford an Army to maintain a system, and it may be that the changes of strategic orientation make that system no longer suitable. Our foreign anxieties outside Europe are temporarily increased, arid our European obligations reduced by the war. It may be that new terms of enlistment and obligation for home and foreign service and numbers of years for active service and reserve will have to be introduced. We have, however, first applied our minds to indicating possible reductions without such drastic disturbances.The reduction of one line battalion from garrison duty abroad will carry with it a possible reduction of the link battalion and its depot at home, and a proportionate decrease in all ancillary services and cost.An infantry battalion alone costs between  160,000 and  200,000 per annum for pay, pensions, food, clothing, housing and medical services.We have, therefore, looked at our obligations for foreign service with a view to suggesting reductions there.India has already realised, as we see it, the increased modern fighting-power of a unit, and in spite of the threat of difficulties in that Empire, has reduced her number of British and native troops. The War Office does not appear to have taken similar account of the increased fighting-power of the unit, and we suggest that they should be invited to do so, on the clear understanding that the reduction of a line battalion abroad normally carries with it, under the Cardwell system, the reduction of the link battalion at home, and of the depot which serves the two battalions, and that they should otherwise review our overseas garrisons.We suggest that this should be done 1. By withdrawing battalions abroad;2. In view of the increased fire power by providing garrisons of half a battalioninstead of a full battalion; 3. With  His  Majesty&apos;s  approval, by  sending certain  Guards  battalionstemporarily to the nearer Foreign Service stations; *4. By employing native troops in the place of British troops;and finally, if these reductions do not prove sufficient, by abandoning or modifying the Cardwell System.It is difficult for us to recommend authoritatively detailed .adjustments in garrisons, but we venture to make the suggestions which are shown in the table above:  1. Over and above the infantry forming the British Expeditionary Force of 6 divisions, with its 4 battalions for lines of communication, for which the Estimates provide, there are also 4 surplus British infantry battalions at Home which might be disbanded.2. Three battalions of the Guards might be sent to Malta and Gibraltar, relieving 3 line battalions for disbandment, together with their linked battalions at Home, which would make 6 battalions, with their 3 depots.3. Two of the 4 infantry battalions proposed for Malta and 1 of the 2 battalions proposed for Gibraltar might be reduced, which, with their linked battalions and depots, would make a total of 6 battalions and 3- depots.4. Two of the 9 battalions in Egypt and Palestine might be reduced, giving a reduction of 4 battalions with 2 more depots.5. As there appears to be no military, reason for stationing 2 infantry battalions in North China in 1922/23 as proposed, the omission of these would give a reduction of 4 battalions and 2 depots.(We are advised by the Foreign Office that under the Protocol of 1901 there are now only 300 British white troops acting as Legation Guard at Peking.)6. The three battalions proposed for Singapore and Ceylon might be reduced to half a battalion at each place, or alternatively, native troops might be employed.   The reduction in this case would be 4 battalions and 2 depots.[7348] G
The total result of the above suggestions would be a reduction in the strength of the Army of 28 battalions and 12 depots.Apart from this, a change of policy which would allow of the 2 battalions from Constantinople being withdrawn would&apos; give a corresponding reduction of link battalions at Home, together with their depots. Similarly, a change of policy in Palestine, admitting of a reduction either in cavalry regiments or infantry battalions in that mandatory territory, would give, corresponding reductions, even if the substitution of Air Force control or some other alternative, with consequent savings, could not be introduced there as in Mesopotamia.We desire to draw attention to the very heavy expenditure which is being incurred on forces in Constantinople, Egypt and Palestine,&apos;the following provision is made in Army Estimates for the present year :  Constantinople ... ... 3,117,000Egypt      ... ... ... ... 5,944,000Palestine ... ... ... 4,219,000Total ... ... 13,280,000N.B.-This is exclusive of Naval and Air Force Expenditure and cost of Mesopotamia, which will be dealt with under the Middle East Vote.Apart from &quot;an estimated reduction in the cost of the force in Palestine to about  2,750,000 in 1922/23, it does not appear that any substantial reduction in the other items of this expenditure is anticipated. The only !force which was maintained in these areas before the war was 1 cavalry regiment and 5 infantry battalions in Egypt, the provision for which at present day costs would not, we understand, have exceeded  1,450,000.We feel that in some places even more might be* done than we have suggested in the reduction of foreign garrisons, and provided that the Home link battalion is not actually required for Home Service, or the British Expeditionary Force, corresponding reductions might be made there.With a reduction of 28 battalions and 12 depots alone, there would remain at Home 60 line battalions, which Avould be fully sufficient, with the 7 battalions of Foot Guards remaining, to produce 5 divisions and the prescribed 4 battalions for Home guards. We think that the Government might desire to cut this to 4 or even 3 divisions, and we see no insuperable.difficulty.Whatever the reductions in Infantry may be, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, E.A.S.C., and R.A.O.C., Hospitals, and other Services, would be correspondingly reduced, but we suggest that greater reductions might well be made in the Cavalry, having regard to*the advent of the Air as an alternative force.In this connection, we suggest that the necessity for retaining next year 3 cavalry regiments in Palestine, 1 cavalry regiment in Egypt, and 1 cavalry regiment in Constantinopleshould be considered, having regard to such increased use as could be made of the Air Arm.In the event of the withdrawal of any or all of these regiments, we suggest that they might be disbanded, together with the linked regiments on the Home Establish-ment, and consequential reduction of depots.Before leaving the question of the reduction of cavalry, and in view only of the extreme urgency for economy, we suggest that, subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval and for the present, the Household Cavalry should be suitably reduced.In the foregoing paragraphs we have endeavoured to suggest one way of looking for economies, by reviewing our overseas garrisons and by allowing for the increased fire power of infantry, with modern equipment.We propose now to indicate a few directions in which we consider that the Army Estimates submitted to us have been cast on too generous a scale, but it must be obvious that these suggestions can only be taken as examples, illustrating our view. It has been impossible for us to consider exhaustively every item ol expenditure, but from the following considerations we are satisfied that there are besides those mentioned many other ways in which striking reductions could be made.
i83. Allocation of Personnel to Arms and Services.Excess Provision of Personnel.The Estimates for 1922/23 have been iramed to meet the cost of the full estab-lishment which the War Office has submitted, but in our investigations &quot;ve elicited the fact that, owing to various reasons, the average strength of the Army during that year will fall short of the full establishment by from 14,000 to 20,000 men, or nearly 10 per cent, of the British troops. This illustrates in a forcible manner how money can be asked for when there is no prospect of its expenditure under the appropriate head, and illustrates the dangers of nrement, to which we draw attention later.General Allocation of Man Power.The full details of the regimental and other establishments proposed for 1922/23 are set out in Appendix (C). There are one or two features of this statement to which we think special reference should be made.The total strength of the three arms cavalry, artillery and infantry amounts to 130,171, as compared with 142,566 in 1914/15: that is, a reduction of 12,395. The total strength of the Army, excluding Colonial and Native troops, however, shows an increase of 13,598, so that we have to find out where the increases have occurred.The Royal Engineers show an increase of from 9,892 to 11,769, but this does not, in fact, reveal the full measure of the increase. In 1914/15, the Royal Engineers were responsible for the service of Signals (now a separate corps), and this service absorbed 1,570, leaving a balance of 8,322, so that the real increase for comparable services in the Royal Engineers is 3,447, or 35 per cent, more than in 1914.The Royal Army Service Corps has increased from 6,305 to 11,014, with ai* estimated feeding strength about 30 per cent, in excess of pre-war days. The explanation given for this abnormal increase is the distribution of the Army, which involves the RA.S.C. having to operate in more scattered details, the large demands which have been made on this corps for clerical assistance to Commands and other offices and the development of long-distance motor transport, which is referred to later.The Medical and Dental Corps shows an increase from 4,460 to 5,533. The cost of Medical and Dental services has been very prominently brought to our notice, and is specially dealt with at a later stage in this report.The Ordnance Corps has increased from 2,428 to 5,075. This is largely accounted for&apos; by the vastly increased equipment of the Army and of its reserves of materiel, but, as we have already pointed out, this increase of equipment has not resulted in any corresponding economies in man-power.The Veterinary Corps shows an increase from 348 to 472; Military Police, 511 to 922; and the Army Pay Corps from 744 to 1,116; and in addition the civilians employed by this corps have risen from 349 to 932. The War Office have, however, informed us since our interview with the Secretary of State and his advisers, that they are prepared to reduce the cost of the Army Pay Corps by 37-4 per cent.In addition to the increased establishment of these various corps, we must remember that new corps have been added to the Army. For example, there is now a Corps of Military Accountants. The numbers submitted to us in the Estimates for this corps were 1,040, so that, in addition to the increase in the Army Pay Corps, there is an entirely new corps, dealing with the cost accounts of the Army. As in the case of the Army Pay Corps, the War Office have admitted they can make a cut of 24-6 per cent. In these two decreases alone there is nearly half a million of money.Two further new corps have been added to the Army. One of these is Signals, with a total personnel of 5,877. In pre-war days the duties of this corps were carried out by a branch of the Royal Engineers, with a personnel of 1,570. This corps is a result of the recent war and doubtless increases the facilities for communications. Tt is also of assistance to Commanding Officers in the tactical disposition of troops and in obtaining accuracy of artillery fire. The question, however, is whether the country can afford to have such a service unless there is to be a corresponding reduction in the fighting units, especially having regard to the fact that we cannot learn that at the moment there is any chance of a war with a highly organised Power which would have a specialised Signals branch of its own. Against semi-organised forces such a corps must justify its existence on the grounds of increased efficiency and corresponding reduction of bayonets, guns or sabres employed.[7348]     &quot; ^ G 2
The other new corps is Tanks, with a personnel of 5,095, and the same considerations apply, although possibly to a greater degree.A further point which an examination of this Appendix (C) brings out in a striking manner is the increased proportion of officers in the Army. Taking all branches of the Army, the ratio of officers to men before the war was as 1 to 17, whereas now the ratio is as 1 to 14. These figures, when translated into numbers, indicate that the Army now has 2,313 more officers than it would have if the pre-war ratio between officers and men had been maintained.We do not select any special arm of the service for comment in this connection, as the tendency to increase the ratio of officers is general throughout, but, as some indication as to what this increase implies, it is sufficient to say that the increased ratio of officers involves the Taxpayer in more than  1,000,000 per annum.The increase in officers flows right through, from the infantry regiments to the highest Command Staffs, and, just as we think that the addition of a Signal Corps or a Tanks Corps should justify itself and the increased efficiency of the fighting machine by a reduction in cost, so we think that&apos;the increased establishments of officers through the Army can only be justified if there are corresponding reductions in cost in other directions.4. Staffs and Commands.In the United Kingdom there are seven principal Commands, namely: Alder shot.Eastern.Northern.Southern.Western.Scottish.Irish.Each Command is commanded by a General Officer&quot;Commanding-in-chief, with a staff, and with one exception (Aldershot) is divided into two or more geographical areas. There is a total of 16 areas, each of which is commanded by a General Officer, this officer combining the duties of Area Commander in some cases with other duties: for example, in some cases he is the Commander of a Territorial Army Division, and in others the Commander of a Regular Division, located in the area.The Expeditionary Force which the Home Army is intended to provide comprises 6 divisions, and each division has allotted to it a General Officer commanding the division and a staff, and he has under him the various divisional and brigade formations.The total staff of these Commands at Home and at Defended Ports is 963, as compared with 936 before the war, but there has been a very large increase in the staffs abroad. The staff in Egypt has increased from 6 to 73 (including Palestine), -and in addition we now have A staff of 58 officers on the Rhine;A staff of 115 officers at Constantinople;A staff of 87 officers at Irak, andA staff of 92 officers and 121 other ranks employed on missions in various capitals of the world.With so much of the Army out of England, we cannot but think that a careful scrutiny would enable the Home staffs to be cut down in order largely to provide for the overseas requirements. We consider that a careful enquiry would show how valuable reductions in those staffs, both at home and abroad, could be effected.5. Army, Divisional and other Troops.In addition to the units forming the divisions for the Expeditionary Force, a number of formations have been added to the divisional organisation, but we would suggest that, in view of the fact that no great war is to be anticipated for some years, and having regard to the need for drastic economy, it is hardly necessary to maintain at the present time the full divisional cadres of artillery, signals and other arms in order to provide for 6 divisions going abroad, as such.For each division the following establishments exist: 1 Divisional Headquarters.3 Infantry Brigade Headquarters.
1 Divisional Artillery Headquarters. 3 Field Artillery Brigade Headquarters. 1 Divisional Royal Engineers Headquarters, 1 Divisional Signal Headquarters Company.In addition to these divisional troops and establishments, there are allocated for the Army mobile batteries of Garrison Artillery. In 1914/15 the total number of all ranks attached to these batteries was 1,609, whereas to-day there are 4,872.It may be argued that this increase in the personnel attached to mobile batteries has been to some extent met by a reduction in the number of men in coastal batteries, but, in the present circumstances, it seems clear that large reductions in the personnel of coastal batteries should be made in any case.This addition of heavy artillery to the equipment of the Expeditionary Force must have added very materially to its efficiency and power, and, having regard to the type of enemy we are likely to meet, we feel that, as in the case of Signals, Tanks, Air, &amp;c, large reductions should be possible in the size of the Army if it has the benefit of these enormous additions to its power. This mobile heavy artillery constitutes in fact, though not in name, a new corps.6. Surplus Units.The Secretary of State, in his memorandum to the Cabinet, dated August last, stated that certain units existed which were surplus to the requirements of the Expeditionary Force, namely, 2 (or possibly 4) batteries of Royal Florse Artillery and 7 Horse &quot;Transport Companies, R.A.S.C.We see no case for the retention of these units.Apart from this, however, there is a long list of units maintained at Home in peace, but not required to form part of the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation, in which we think that some cutting down might be made. As illustrations of these units we refer to a Horse Transport Depot Company, consisting of 65 officers and 185 men for training horse transport drivers in peace, and for mobilisation of horse transport drivers and artificers for posting to such units as Field Ambulances and Headquarters Units. We draw attention to the enormous proportion of officers. There is also a Motor Transport Corps Depot, consisting of 21 officers and 858 men for similar duties with motor transport. This is a large increase on pre-war provision, and we suggest that in existing circumstances the training should be done with the units and thus avoid the continuance of companies of this description.In the Expeditionary Force there is a provision for 4 infantry battalions for lines of communication. As it is difficult to conceive that in the next ten years we shall be sending a full 6-divisional force abroad, it appears hardly necessary to retain for its purposes 4 battalions to guard lines of communications, as it should be possible to provide these for smaller expeditions from other resources.7. War Office Staff.      -The total staff of the War Office is set out in Appendix (D), from which&apos;&apos;it will be seen that the numbers employed have&apos; increased from 1,878 to 4,114, but of these 560 are still required in connection with the distribution of medals, leaving a total increase of 1,676. In considering the details, it will be seen that the increase is general throughout. It is explained that this is to some extent due to the fact that Army Regulations have to be recodified and recast and that the Army is in a state of flux and has not yet got back to a routine basis; that the personnel are more difficult to deal with than in the past and raise more questions of an individual character; that problems arising out of the war remain to be solved; and to the fact that we have various activities in the Middle East. But one of the principal reasons given appeared to be the increase of domestic military corre-spondence, and in our opinion, as there is an increase of clerical staff in all the Commands (as pointed out under the heading of the Royal Army Service Corps), the way to stop this correspondence is to reduce the staff which creates it. The Army is little bigger than it was in 1913/14, and apart from those engaged in the issue of medals, we consider that the War Office Staff should be capable of considerable [reductions, and during next year its numbers should, apart from the issue of medals, approximate to pre-war numbers. We recognise that if our suggestions as to the [reduction in the size of the Army are adopted considerable additional work of a purely temporary character will be unavoidable.! As evidence of the possibility of a reduction in the Estimates, we may say that jsince our meeting with the War Office, they have indicated that a reduction in the
Estimates for one Branch alone of  196,000 is possible, equivalent to 37 5 per cent, of the cost of that Branch. The total Estimates for the War Office for the year 1922/23 are  1,334,000, and this compares with  457,000 before the war.8. Education.The cost of Education of various kinds, including specialised training, has increased from  272,000 to  1,090,000, and as in the other services, there has been an enormous development in activity of this kind. A greater effort is being made not only to improve the general education of the soldier^ but also better to fit him for civilian life, and the old Army Schools establishment of 19 officers and 267 warrant officers has expanded into an Army Education Corps of 252 officers and 375 warrant officers and sergeants. This additional education may have much to commend it, but the point is whether the country can afford at the present time to spend money in this way.Cadets.The net cost (included in total figures for Education) of educating cadets at Woolwich and Sandhurst was  35,420 in 1914/15 and is estimated at  198,000 in 1922/23, the cost now being  370 per annum for each cadet. We call attention to the fact that at Woolwich there is a staff of 217 for 280 cadets, and at Sandhurst 562 staff for 700 cadets. The fees charged amount only to  75 a year, as compared with  150 pre-war, and considerably lower fees are charged for the sons of regular and temporary officers who served in the war.In our opinion, the cost should be reduced by at least  100 per annum per cadet, and on that understanding, the fees should be raised to  200 per cadet, with half fees for the sons of the officers of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. As in the case of Dartmouth we also recommend that there should be a few scholarships for boys of outstanding ability whose parents have only slender means, and who show marked ability by some prescribed test.Specialised Training for Officers.Considerable developments have taken place in the Specialised Training for Officers, as a result of the experience of the war, due to activities in gas, tanks, machine guns, &amp;c, the total cost,  538,000, being included in the figures given for education.All the various schools which existed before the war, such as the School of Military Engineering; the Physical Training School; the School of Instruction at Shoeburyness, have increased their activities enormously, and new schools have been formed, such as -The Senior Officers&apos; School for Technical Training; The Machine Gun School, Seaford; The Anti-Aircraft Defence School; The Central Gas School; and . The Tank Corps Central School.We recognise the necessity for taking full advantage of the experience of the war, but we cannot see.the necessity under the conditions which have been laid down for incurring the whole of this heavy cost. We think that the War Office should be told that in the present financial state of the country, great economies under this head have got to be realised, either by reducing the numbers of officers and men with specialised training, or by a slowing down of the rate at which this training is given.9. .    Technical Establishments, Inspection and Research.In the Army, as in the other two Services, great activity is&apos; shown under this head.The cost of Inspection and Research is as under : Inspection. Research. Total.                        1914/15      ...         ...      154,580 109,000 263,5801921/22      ...         ...      802,500 593,000 1,395,5001922/23   &quot;...         ...      620,000 625,000 1,245,000
Inspection is now at four times the pre-war cost. It is clear to us that the possession of large stocks of war material is directly responsible for the increase in expenditure under this heading, as whilst practically no new guns or ammunition are being produced there is a large staff engaged on the periodical inspection ofthese existing reserves of stores.As regards Research, there are great increases in the pre-war establishments, namely, the Ordnance College and the Research Department, but ten new establish-ments have come into being, of which the most costly are: The Chemical Warfare Committee Chemical Warfare Station, Porton Tank Design Department Signals Experimental Establishment Experimental Bridging Company 57,000 68,000 70,000 36,000 21,000In our opinion, although doubtless Research if economically and, wisely conducted is desirable, the country cannot afford to spend money on research on this increased scale, with its consequent effect upon the estimates, and in view of the fact that we have to consider a great war as unlikely in the next eight or ten years, we think that this Research should be slowed down, and that an allowance ol  600,000 per annum would adequately meet the needs of the country in respect oi both Inspection and Research, and this should be allotted by the Army Council in the directions where benefits are most likely to ensue.10. Works and Buildings.The provision for Works Services in the Army Estimates furnished to us is, including the Middle East, as follows : 1921/22:  6,851,600 (including Middle East,  1,745,100). 1922/23:  6,921,000 (including Middle East,  1,723,000).The provision for the current year includes: Major New Works :  2,269,000 (including Middle East,  1,050,000). Minor Works :  250,000.Purchase of Land :  375,000 (including Middle East,  175,000).It should be observed that, including expenditure provided under other heads of the Vote, the estimated gross cost of the New Works, apart from maintenance, for 1921/22 is  3,982,000.As regards the Middle East,  650,000 was provided this year for further barrack accommodation and temporary camps, rifle ranges, &amp;c, in Palestine. We are informed that all expenditure on permanent works is suspended for the present, but that authority has been given for an expenditure of  115,000 on temporary camps and  21,000 on semi-permanent ordnance storage accommodation. For Mesopotamia  400,000 (in addition to about  500,000 included elsewhere in the Vote for enlisted labour) was provided for permanent cantonments, but in view of the change of policy only  30,000 has been spent up-to-date.As regards works in this country it would appear, as a result of our enquiries, that the following large schemes for which initial provision is taken could be abandoned or postponed : Total Cost Estimate.  Signal Service Training Centre (Maresfield) ...      188,500 I &apos; plus       50,000 for land.Accommodation for Mechanical Transport Com-panies, Ebury Bridge    ... ... ...       46,200School   for    Mechanical    Transport   Drivers,Catterick Bridge ....... ...      127,500Artificers&apos;Training School, Blandford...11 ... 233,600 School of Military Administration, Chisledon ... 27,300 Married   Quarters,   Leicester,   Lichfield,   andLincoln ... ... ... ...       20,400
The Estimates also contain provision for the following schemes for the recon-struction of barrack accommodation and the provision of married quarters for officers and men : Total Cost Estimate.  Reconstruction of Wellington Barracks ...      183,000Warley Barracks    ... ... ... ...        10,400Chelsea Barracks   ... ... ... ...      117,000Quarters for N.C.O&apos;s. and Men (Guards), FrancisStreet ... ... ... ... ...      140,000Artillery Barracks, St. John&apos;s Wood ... ...       98,000Married Quarters Aldershot       ... ... ... ...        63,700Bromley ... ... ... ...        46,800Staff College   ... ... ... ...        44,200Curragh ... ... ... ...       59,700Cork ... ... ... ... ...       15,600Dublin ... ... ... ...       10,600Bovington       ... ... ... ...      110,000In existing financial circumstances we consider that, with the exception of Wellington and Chelsea Barracks, these schemes should be postponed or reduced. We understand that the amount included for Major New Works in the Estimate for 1922/23 is  2,710,000, of which  1,110,000 is for the Middle East. The latter amount will clearly require complete reconsideration in the light of the policy now adopted.In view of the foregoing considerations we recommend that, apart from such expenditure on permanent works in the Middle East as may be imperatively neces-sarv under existing policy, the provision for Major New Works in the Estimates for 1922/23 should be limited to  250,000.Maintenance of Buildings accounts for  2,217,000 under this head, and in view of the need for economy and falling prices we consider that there should be a cut of at least 40 per cent, in this figure.11 Stores and Reserves.The amount asked for in the Estimates for 1922/23 (excluding Middle East  389,000) is  3,926,700, which is the cost of the purchase of stores required.At the end of the war, generally speaking, the Army was authorised to hold four years&apos; stock of stores, and it was the intention to work down to one year&apos;s stock in kind, but having regard to the present financial situation and the tendency of prices still further to fall, we are of opinion that the margin of stores held should be considerably reduced, and that for ordinary trade articles stocks should be reduced to the equivalent of three months&apos; consumption. Should prices stabilise, and the need for longer term contracts reappear, we see no reason why contracts should not be let with deferred dates of delivery.With regard to general war stores, the War Office now hold equipment for 6 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division, and also for 14 territorial divisions. We cannot but think that the psychological effect of holding all these stores must be such as to create in the military mind a great desire to have personnel, transport and all the other constituent parts of an army equally ready for the despatch of 20 divisions, equipped on a European war scale.We will refer to the matter later under &quot;Ordnance Factories,&quot; but we learn that at Enfield all the rifles and machine-guns for this equipment are being over-hauled at the present time; and, as we have already said, the inspecting staff under the Master-General of the Ordnance is occupied in testing and inspecting the ordnance equipment involved in this huge reserve, and indeed there is in the building programme an item for danger buildings at Bramley for the sole purpose of turning over the artillery ammunition and inspecting it under danger building conditions.Over and above this aspect of the question, in storage space alone, field ammunition and components now require 1,800,000 sq. ft. as compared with 220,000 sq. ft. in 1914, war equipment, guns, &amp;c, require 3,750,000 sq. ft. as compared with about 1,000,000; with corresponding increases in care and mainten-ance, and guards throughout. .The civilian personnel in connection with these stores is now costing  2,500,000 per annum as compared Avith  500,000 pre-war.  We have been particularly struck
with this large cost of civilian personnel in connection with these depots, and have discussed with the War Office whether military labour could not be employed to a large extent on this work with economy to the State, provided they are drawn from existing units.  We think that this should be the rule and not the exception.12. Royal Ordnance Factories and National Factories.We are impressed with the efforts which are being made by the Director-General.of Factories under very difficult circumstances to get down costs. There appears to be no military justification for keeping Woolwich, Waltham and Enfield at their present size.The Director-General told us that Woolwich had been reduced to an establish-ment of 10,000 hands, allowing for short time; that he could not go below 8,000  not because he required so many, but because he had been instructed to keep foremen and supervisory personnel for immediate expansion on the outbreak of war and that with that limitation, he could not reduce the number of operatives without getting them entirely out of proportion to the supervisory grades.Woolwich is being employed by the Mint in various ways, on medals, on plaques, on battle clasps, and work of that kind, all of which will gradually come to an end. They are also building 100 locomotives at an estimated cost of  1,600,000, upon which a loss of  900,000 is estimated by the Director-General of Factories.A special memorandum (Appendix (E) ) gives further details about Woolwich and other Factories.Waltham Abbey, the explosives factory, is being kept in commission to make a very small quantity of black powder, and there are about 500 persons on the pay roll. There is no justification at all for keeping this factory open, and it may be closed forthwith with very considerable saving to the Taxpayer. The factory could be retained if it was considered necessary so that should an emergency arise, it could be re-opened.Enfield is occupied in making revolvers for the Army and upon overhauling and reconditioning the rifles and machine-guns retained as part of the equipment for the 20 divisions on mobilisation.It is difficult to recommend any other specific economies in connection with these factories, or with the National Factories, but they are undoubtedly an unjustifiable expense to-day so far as Army costs are concerned, and they are further dealt with, as stated, in Appendix (E). Throughout our investigation we have been frequently struck by the cost which is involved in storing, maintaining, inspecting and guarding war ordnance stores sufficient to equip twenty divisions, and this aspect is one well worthy of consideration. We have no knowledge as to whether it is intended to replace these stores as they become obsolete.13. Clothing Allowance.As in the case of the otljer two Services, we think that the standard of clothing allowance might be reduced by one-third, so that the soldiers, like civilians, should economise in their clothes, but it should be definitely understood that the standard of repair of uniform is considerably lowered, so that the men do not suffer. This will effect a saving of  500,000 a year.14. Horses and Forage.The provision for 1922/23 is  1,997,000. The feeding strength to-day is 62,000 horses, but Ave are told that for 1922/23 the establishment for horses amounts to 33,000, in addition to which 7,000 horses are in the Middle East, employed on aftermath services. We have seen no figures justifying the retention of these 7,000 horses. Apart, however, from these, the establishment of horses of 33,000 compares with an average strength in 1914/15 of 28,542, notwithstanding the reduction of cavalry and the very large development of motor transport, and it is obvious that if the strength of the personnel is 14,000 to 20,000 below establishment, as anticipated by the War Office, there should be at least a corresponding reduction in the strength of horses.We are confirmed in our view of this by evidence which was given to us that the Estimates for 1922/23 included a provision of  76,000 to replace horses which had been bought in the year 1921 /22 and kept to meet anticipated requirements which had not materialised, and they had then been sold.   In addition,  127,000 is[7348] H
provided for the purchase of 1,718 horses&apos;for existing units. If the army is reduced both these items should be saved.The reduction shown, excluding Middle East, is only 13 per cent. It is admitted that the Estimates are framed on the prices which obtained in August last, and having regard to the considerations above and the heavy fall in the price of horses and forage, we feel that the provision under this heading should be reduced by  500,000.15. Motor Transport Depots and Training.We have given attention to the position with regard to Motor Transport, and attach a statement (Appendix (F)) showing the normal establishment -and the additional vehicles held as Maintenance and Mobilisation Reserves in 1922/23 as compared with the total number of vehicles held in 1914. It will be seen that in total the number of vehicles, apart from motor cycles, is now 7,192 as compared with 479, and the number of motor cycles has risen from 24 to 2,415.Before dealing with the normal establishment of these vehicles, we call attention to the extraordinarily large number of vehicles held as Maintenance and Mobilisation Reserves. At Home, the normal establishment comes to 1,541 vehicles, while the additional vehicles held are more than double this number, namely, 3,173. Abroad, the normal establishment is put at 1,041, the additional vehicles being 1,464.. Having regard to the decision of the Cabinet as to the non-likelihood of war we think that as a first step the whole of the ^additional vehicles should be surrendered, which would at once release 4,637 vehicles and 1,486 motor cycles. We are forced to the conclusion that the mere possession of vast reserves of this kind lesults in increased costs for maintenance, garage charges, depreciation, and personnel, and further, that with this large number of additional vehicles available there is always the tendency to make use of them in preference to other forms of transport without carefully considering the alternative cost.In regard to normal establishment, the principal type is the lorry of 3-ton or 30-cwt. capacity, and the normal Home establishment has grown from 124 in 1914 to 765 in 1922/23. The normal establishment for abroad is 306 of these lorries, whereas none was required in 1914. We understand that the system of supplying the Army at Home has been materially changed, and that now bulk purchases are made and stores distributed for very considerable distances direct to the units by Army lorries. The reports upon which the change was made are quite unconvincing and we have not seen any figures which have satisfied us that this method of distribution is an economical one. We could not find that the Finance Branch of the War Office was satisfied as to the economy of the arrangement.Motor cars which are included in above figures call for special comment. The establishment at Home in 1914 was 42. whereas for 1922/23 the establishment is shown as 90 for an Army at Home not larger than the pre-war Army. In addition, the Army are holding as Maintenance and Mobilisation Reserves a further 313 cars. As regards abroad, 3 cars were shown in the establishment for 1914; now the normal establishment is put at 182, and a further 161 cars are held in reserve.The situation in regard to motor ambulances is even more striking. The establishment in 1914 was 13; it is now shown as 107, and 423 are held in excess of establishment. It is difficult to conceive the reasons for holding these large numbers of ambulances.Our investigation into these figures has led us to the conclusion that the establishment for motor transport is throughout on an unnecessary scale, and that without difficulty the Army should be able to manage with a normal establishment of not more than 50 per cent, of the numbers shown, in addition to surrendering the whole of the vehicles now held above establishment.In spite of these large numbers of surplus cars, the Army propose to spend  10,000 on the purchase of ten 30-cwt. pneumatic-tyred lorries. It may be that the pneumatic-tyred lorry will prove to be the vehicle of the future; but we do not think the State can afford to indulge in experiments of this character at the present time, having regard to the fact that surplus cars are held in such large numbers.It is interesting to note that in 1922/23 the War Office propose to spend  324,000 for spare parts for the vehicles on normal establishment, and this works out to an average of  139 per vehicle for material only, without anything for the value of labour or overhead charges. The labour will probably, even with the most economical management, work out at a ratio of not less than 10s. to  1 value of spare
17, Territorial Force.Provision for this force in 1922/23 is slightly under  5,000,000. This was for an establishment of 192,000; in actual fact, the strength is only 138,000, but the War Office anticipate that this shortage will not produce any reduction in 1922/23 owing to the initial expense in connection with the formation of the Force.The cost per head in 1914/15 was  13 2s. 3d., whereas the estimated cost for next year is  30 5s. 3d.The permanent divisional and regimental staffs are practically maintained at pre-war numbers and the cost of them to-day is  1,135,000, and even with projected reductions, will cost nearly  1,000,000, with a smaller number of men.With no immediate prospect of war, andvtherefore with a much more slender prospect of invasion of these Islands, we are of opinion that the whole of the permanent staff for the Territorial Force should be reviewed, and that the expenditure on staff should not exceed  500,000 per annum. But, although there is provision for 192,000 of all ranks (which is considerably less than pre-war), we fail to see how this part of the defence of the Empire can adequately be considered from the point of view of economy without bringing in the Air. Aerial attack must be one of the principal considerations of the future, and we suggest that the Territorial Force, in so far as it is cast for the defence of these Islands, cannot be considered without considering at the same time the problem of defence against aerial attack. If the Cabinet see fit to adopt our suggestion as to the creation of a Minister of Defence, this is one of the questions which would undoubtedly be considered by that Minister when created.18. Medical Services.The establishment of the Royal Army Medical Corps is increased from 4,460 costing  695,000 in 1914/15 to 5,533, costing  1,700,000, in 1922/23.     Of the[7348] H 2parts used, so that the average cost of maintenance per vehicle on normal establishment for next year is estimated at  200, which is a very high figure: As in the case of other stores, the Army holds large stocks of spare parts and other equipment so as to be ready in the event of mobilisation. The value of these stocks amounts to roughly  1,000&apos;,000.In addition to this Mobilisation Reserve large stocks of spares are held, amounting in value to more than  678,000, which should be used before further purchases are made.In the analysis of the estimates of expenditure on Motor Transport for 1922/23, we observe that it is proposed to spend  10,800 on reconditioning 27 armoured cars in order to complete the peace establishment of the Territorial Armv. We think this is an illustration of the kind of expenditure which can well be deferred.We have also considered the personnel of the Transport Companies. The etablishment for a service company of 20 four-wheeled vehicles consists of 3 officers and 80 other ranks, that is, four men to each vehicle. Thirty drivers are shown, which gives a 50 per cent, margin over one drivei&quot; to each vehicle, and 20 cleaners are provided, that is, 1 cleaner to each vehicle. Over and above these numbers there are workshop personnel numbering 18 per Company. It should be remembered in considering these figures that in the normal establishment the 20 vehicles are not all lorries, possibly only 14 are lorries, 2 motor cars, and the remainder made up of workshop vehicle and ambulances (not in regular use). We have ascertained the figure with regard to the cleaning staff employed by large Omnibus Companies, and find the ratio in their case is approximately one man for each five vehicles. In the case of large double decked trams, the ratio is only two cleaners for 5 cars.16. Militia.The provision in the estimates for this force is  1,500,000, as compared with  260,000 in the current year. If it is recruited, the cost will increase to  2,750,000 per annum, as compared with slightly over  1,000,000 for the Special Reserve of pre-war days.We are of opinion that the necessity for recruiting this force at the present time should be further considered, as, in the event of an emergency arising, there exist large numbers of men in the civilian population who have had a thorough training in arms, and who would quickly respond if their services for the defence of the Empire were required.
increases of 157 officers and 916 other ranks, 94 officers and 168 other ranks are for the new Dental Corps. The remainder are stated to be due to provision for garri-sons in Mesopotamia, Palestine and on the Rhine. The total cost of all Army Medical Services is stated to be as follows; Total Per head of BritishCost. and Colonial Troops.      s.   d.1914/15 ... ... 1,340,000 7 13 81921/22 ... ... 3,979,000 19 12 no comparative figures for 1922/23.These figures are calculated under the new Army Cost Accounting System to cover the whole cost of the Service, including effective and non-effective pay and maintenance of medical staff, the maintenance of hospitals, the purchase of medicines, &amp;e, and the hire of a hospital ship, and it cannot, therefore, be compared strictly with the Naval cost of  12 a head. Making all allowances, however, for this consideration and the additional expenditure involved by conditions in the Middle East, the cost appears to us to be unduly high. The Army had no hospital ship before the war. The Navy had one and now has two. The Army hospital ship costs  172,000 per annum and we suggest that combined use of the Naval ship should be considered.In this connection we desire to state that in our opinion very heavy avoidable expenditure is involved in the maintenance of separate Medical Services for the Navy, Army and Air Force.The present position is that- the Army and Air Force maintain separate Medical Corps and Nursing Services. We are informed that the rates of pay granted to Air Force Medical Officers in 1918 led to increases being made in Army rates beyond those originally recommended by the War Office. Apart from the maintenance of separate Services, efforts appear to have been made to avoid overlapping by enabling the Air Force to make use of Army hospitals and laboratories and to draw medical stores from Army supplies.The Naval and Military Medical Services appear to be entirely separate, and we have received remarkable particulars as regards Service hospitals at home and abroad which appear to us to indicate very serious duplication. Abroad separate Naval and Military hospitals are maintained at Bermuda, Hong Kong, Gibraltar and Malta. The figures of admission to these hospitals given to us for August and September appear to indicate that at each of these Stations one hospital would have provided sufficient accommodation.At home there are twenty-four Army, hospitals which have another Army hospital within 10 miles of them. Apart from this the Army and Navy have separate hospitals (each having in some cases more than one) in the following areas : Army. . Navy.Chatham and Gravesend. Chatham.Shorncliffe and Dover. Deal.Chichester. ^Cosham.     i f Eastleigh.Gosport.     V Portsmouth, Area       -i Forton.Netley. .                                  [ Haslar. Hilsea.Devonport. Plymouth.Pembroke Dock.

Patients.Officers      ... ... ... 607 234Other Ranks ... ... 11,249        5,101.From which it appears that the hospitals are not half used. A unified Medical Service would yield substantial benefits, but meantime we consider that the War Office should effect a drastic review of the number of Army hospitals with a view to their reduction and concentration, and that arrangements should be made between the War Office and Admiralty similar to those
20. Analysis of Establishments.We have now dealt with the Army Estimates in two main directions. We have suggested that by limiting our overseas garrisons, and reducing the corresponding units at Home, a great reduction could be made in the size of the Army. We have also dealt with a limited number of instances where we think economies could be made. These latter reductions are very largely additional to the economies, direct and indirect, suggested by our first line of thought, which involves a reduction of at least 28 battalions of infantry, with consequent reductions of other arms and services, but we wish clearly to indicate that the economies we have suggested are by no means exhaustive, nor do they represent a complete review of the whole of Army expenditure. We do not doubt that further study on these lines would reveal the possibility of many additional economies.We have been impressed with the great extension of activity on the part of the Army, compared with the activity which existed before the war under the head of additional Arms, additional Staffs, additional Clerks, additional Establishments in the War Office, additional Education and Research Establishments, and so forth, and we have therefore endeavoured to arrive at a calculation which would show what use the Army Council is making of the man power for which it is asking. In order to test whether, on the whole, the man power is economically employed, we have made the following calculations : Pre-War Estimates, 1914/15.Force abroad     .. .. ..     10K,928per cent, for relief and drafting units at home .. .. ..      87,143TotalAdd one-seventh for recruits196.071 28,010Total requirements for maintenance of forces abroad ..          ..          .. 224,081Additional personnel at home for other purposes        ..          .. 24.560248,641In the first place, we have taken the pre-war army of 248,641 men, which includes the British troops in India. At that time the force abroad was 108,928 men, and a number of 87,143 (or 80 per cent.) provided the link units at home, with their ancillary services. That gave a total of 196,071.If we add 28,010 the average number of recruits which is equal to one-eeventh of the above figure-the total requirements for the maintenance of forces abroad, including the link battalions at home, are 224,081 men.Before the war, in addition, there were 24,560 men athome, including the Guards and Household Cavalry,which made up a total of 248,641. . This table, which is given opposite, is an analysis of thepre-war army. If we apply the same principles to the army estimated for 1922/23, we get the following result:-which have already been made between the War Office and the Air Ministry, with a view to the avoidance of duplicated provision, by means of the mutual use of Army or Navy hospitals, whichever course is more economical in any particular area. We think also that disabled war pensioners should be admitted into Military and Naval hospitals indiscriminately, thus effecting a saving in Ministry of Pensions hospital charges.19. Travelling Concessions.As in the case of the Navy, officers and men obtain return tickets at a single fare the difference being paid by the War Office. There seems to be no sufficient reason for the continuance of this concession, which was not given by the Government before the war.

Egypt, in pre-war days, had 6,214, and to-day she has 4,679 additional. Constantinople lias now 2,584, Palestine 5,473 and Iraq 5,185, all post-war abnormal demandsThe garrison duty abroad on the present peace requirements of the War Office account for 16,348 men, so that our normal requirements abroad are 86,458 men; our ab-normal requirements are an addi-tional 35,267.Following the proportions pre-war, we add to the normal peace require-ments of 86*458, 69,166 for link units at home, 80 per cent., giving a total of 155,624 for peace requirements and the link m,its at homo, to which one-seventh must be added for recruits. This gives a total of 177,856 for requirements of the forces abroad, as compared with 224,081 before the war.Then we add the same number of additional troops at home on the pre-war basis, namely 24,560, and we arrive at a total peace requirement of 202,416 men, which,deducted from the total number included in the estimates leaves an unaccounted-for balance of 54,429.. This table. appears to us to be an accurate, mathematical compilation, based on actuals. The question that we have to ask is how the additional and abnormal demands of 35,000 are to be met, and why-there is an excess of 54,000 on the Estimates ?We think it not unreasonable that a very large portion of the additional and abnormal demand for 35,000 men should be met either from the 69,000 men in line units at home, or from the 24,000 additional personnel at home on the pre-war basis, which Include the whole of the Guards Battalions. In fact, to-day the troops on the /Rhine are considered as Home Service battalions and are admittedly the link battalions of Foreign Service units If this fails to find the men needed, we suggest that the foreign garrisons, which Uke up 16,348 men, should be resorted to, and that the recruit course be curtailed for the present.The 54,000 additional troops provided in the 1922/23 Estimates for the theoretical peace requirements are accounted for as follows: The War Office has asked for a money provision for 14,000-20,000 men more than they believe they can enlist, and therefore the excess is brought down to something under 40,000. In addition, there is the great increase of new corps, additional officers and men on the Staff. Schools, Training, and so forth.This calculation appears to us to confirm our view that the staffing and use of the man power, in the Army to-day is on a far less economical basis than it was before the war, and that in addition to anything that the Government may see its way to do in the direction of reducing battalions abroad and link battalions at home on the lines of the first portion of this Report, they should also require the Army to reduce very materially the Estimates for personnel.It will be seen that in&apos;several instances the Estimates have been cast in a way which shows large margins, and we desire here to comment upon a facility which has recently been afforded the War Office. Upon the recommendation of the Select Committee on National Expenditure, a new form of accounts has been adopted under which the whole of the Army Estimates are taken as one Vote, Consequently, with Treasury approval but without statutory authority, any excess under one heading can be applied to meet a deficiency under another heading. This facility has already been under the consideration of the Public Accounts Committee, and they have expressed the opinion that if there is
ley tel.any important departure from the original programme of expenditure the matter should be brought to the notice of Parliament, either by presenting a statement showing the revised allocation of expenditure, or, if necessary, by submitting a Supplementary Estimate in the form of a token Vote. Having regard to the extreme importance of Parliamentary and Treasury control, we are of opinion that the question of such transfer requires strict scrutiny.We are convinced from our survey of the War Office Estimates that there is great room for economy in men and money without in any way endangering the defence of the Empire.21. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of the opinion: (1.) That man-power has been estimated on a lavish scale for 1922/23, and that a reduction of 50,000 officers and men could be made, without in any way reducing the forces employed by the War Office on foreign service. (2.) That the introduction of new arms and corps, and of the Air Force, which have been created with the object of increasing the fighting efficiency of the defence forces of the Empire, is not reflected in corresponding reductions in other directions, and that savings could be made on that account.(3.) That there has been an increase in all the ancillary and auxiliary services of the Army which the country cannot afford and in which drastic economies should be made. (4.) That the abnormal reserve of mobilisation equipment and arms now held is costly to store, guard and maintain, and that the effect of holding it results in heavy additionalindirect cost. (5.) That the Army Estimates for 1922/23 should be reduced from  75,197,800 to  55,000,000 for that year, and that in the subsequent year still lower Estimates should suffice.In this recommendation no account is taken of possible further reductions resulting from a review by the Government of our military requirements at Home and Abroad, normal and abnormal.No account has been taken of any reduction in pay and allowances which the Government may decide to make, and no account is taken of any abnormal increase in the Non-Effectiye Vote, caused by a reduction of personnel transferred to the Retired List, with both of which items we deal separately in a later Report.

The estimated loss on the sale of these locomotives is  900.000.The number of locomotives completed and in storage at the present time is thirteen, and twelve others are complete except for tenders. In addition fifty-two boilers are finished complete with fittings, all the wheels required are cast, and all materials for frames, motions, axles, &amp;c, have been supplied.Enfield is mainly engaged on overhauling rifles, machine guns for reserve and manufacturing revolvers for the Army.The value of the orders placed at Waltham is only  5,000, and the remaining expenditure is to maintain the nucleus staff.National Factories.The staff employed at National Factories has been reduced from 2,316 on the 1st April, 1921, to 302, made up as follows : -	April 1, 1921.

We indicate economies which we think might be realised even if the recommendation as to a Ministry of Defence is not adopted; but we consider that further economies depend upon one co-ordinating authority being responsible for the three Services.2. The Outline Estimates for 1922/23 compare with the Estimates for 1921/22 as follows: Gross Estimates&apos; Add-Middle East War liabilitiesTotal      .......Appropriations-in-aidNet total ...A comparison with the amount spent in pre-war years on the Royal Naval , Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps is somewhat difficult to give, and in any event it would be of little or no value having regard to the enormous development m the use of aircraft.1921/22.	1922/23. 	 16,367,867	13,317,1001,081,000	1,720.7001.585,000	&apos;   504,90019,033,867	15,542,700622,400	2,585,40018,411,467	12,957,300
Details of the Estimates are set out in Appendix (A).The Air Ministry divide their expenditure in the following way : - -1922/2:5  Active Service Squadrons        ... ...      3,511,000Other Establishments  ... ... ...      7,912,000Capital and miscellaneous expenditure including Supply and Research and Civil Aviation     ... ... ...      4,944,00016,367,000Deduct expenditure in India   ... ...        825,00015,542,000It will be seen that the expenditure on Active Service Squadrons is only 21 per cent, of the total expenditure.3. The Estimates of the Air Force are not built up to provide for a specific Force to meet more or less definite liabilities, as in the case of the &quot; One-Power Standard &quot; of the Navy. At present the Air Force has exercised no direct national responsi-bilities. It has to meet the requirements of the Navy and the Army for aircraft and personnel for co-operation with the fleet or troops in the field, and it endeavours to keep a reserve available for emergencies, and equipment for training. The Cabinet have approved a strength from time to time, and the last authorised increase, viz., the creation of five Reserve Squadrons in July 1920, was sanctioned in the belief that great reductions might be effected thereby in other Services.In the Estimates for 1922/23 the Active Service Squadrons* are allotted asfollows: United Kingdom Co-operation with Navy ... ... ... 5Co-operation with Army ... ... ... 3Communications and Refresher Courses ... 1Reserve       ... ... ... ... ... 3Mediterranean Co-operation with Navy .... ... ... 1^Egypt and Palestine        ... ... ... ... 5Mesopotamia     ... ... ... ... ... 8India    ... ... ... ... ... 6Total    ... ... ... ... 32iThe Squadrons in India are not a charge upon the Exchequer but upon India. Those in Mesopotamia are taking over the work now performed by the Army, and, as we have already stated, this transfer from Army to Air Force is estimated to result in a saving in 1922/23 of  14,000,000. The cost is met by an Appropriation-in-aid from the Middle East Vote, but is still a charge on the Taxpayer.We have continually before us the view of the Cabinet that no great war need be anticipated for at least ten years, and in these circumstances suggest that the question of a considerable reduction in the number of Squadrons should be considered. We recognise that a sufficient nucleus must be retained for training personnel, and, further, that the germ of co-operation with the other two Services must be kept alive. We consider, however, that all expenditure beyond this minimum should be eliminated unless the Service requiring a further allotment of Air forces for co-operation with it can show that such allotment will result in savings in other directions.For 1922/23 six and a half Squadrons are shown as working in co-operation with the Navy, and three in co-operation with the Army in the United Kingdom, and we feel that, having regard to the circumstances referred to above, these Squadrons should be reduced in number.  We suggest they should be reduced to 1 Squadron in co-operation with the Navy in the United Kingdom, 1 Squadron in co-operation with the Navy in the Mediterranean, 1 Squadron in co-operation with the Army in the United Kingdom,which would give a saving of six and a half Squadrons.* A Squadron is usually twelve machines, with twelve machines in reserve in the case of-Home Service Squadrons and twenty-four in reserve in the case of Squadrons abroad.
If the Navy and the Army require further Air Units we feel that they should be able to show reductions in their own provisions which would justify the supply of these Units.There are five Squadrons in Egypt and Palestine working in co-operation with the Army. It has not been shown to us that proper allowance has been made for the existence of these Squadrons in fixing the force necessary for the Garrisons in Egypt. In these circumstances we recommend that the question of reducing the number of Squadrons to three should be considered, unless greater economies can be effected in the Army expenditure by their retention. If the Squadrons in Egypt are reduced to three, we suggest that a fair proportion of these three should be allocated to the Air Force for use in Trans-Jordania. These suggestions would reduce the total number of Squadrons in the Air Force from thirty-two and a half to twenty-four, and, including indirect expenditure on administration, training, reserves, &amp;c, would involve a saving of over  2,500,000 per annum.Apart from these general observations on the strength of the Air Force, we have considered each Vote in detail.Vote A: Personnel.4. Before dealing with the various estimates of cost it may be well to refer to the personnel of the Air Force.  The establishment for 1922/23 is shown as follows :  Officers ... ... ... ..        3.091Other ranks      ....... ... ...      27,070Total   ... ... ...      30,161^ The numbers in this force attached to the Air Force abroad, or Operational TJnits at home, amount to: Officers ... ... ... ...       1,258Other ranks      ... ... ... ...        9,332Total   ... ... 10,590or 35 per cent, of the total personnel. So that the Air Force to-day has for each man abroad or attached to Operational Units at home, practically two men engaged in training, under training, or in administrative services of various kinds.Training and Education.5. The numbers engaged in giving or receiving instruction are particularly striking as the following figures show : Officers.Engaged in connection with - education and training   ...      532 Under training    ...     &apos;    ...      466The figures are exclusive of civilian teaching staff (51 full time and a number part time).This appears to be a very heavy establishment of training personnel in compari-son to the numbers under training.The education given at Cranwell to the Cadets, apart from technical training, is similar in most respects to that given to the Cadets at Sandhurst and Woolwich; but the total cost, namely  850 per annum, is very much higher, due to the expensive technical training given. As in the case of Dartmouth, Sandhurst and Woolwich, where the cost is  462,  373 and  366 respectively, the fees charged to the parents of Cadets are out of all proportion to the cost to the State, and as in the case of those Colleges, we feel that a considerable increase in the fees should be imposed. We suggest that the fees should be raised from  75 per annum to  200 per annum with a reduction of 50 per cent, in the case of sons of officers of H.M. Forces, leaving also, as in the case of the other Services, a few places for scholarships or bursaries to boys whose parents are of slender means and who show marked ability by some prescribed test. This increase . would still impose a great cost on the State for the education of a Cadet.  TheMen. Total.5,669 6,2016,035 6,501
suggested fees are based on an assumption that the cost, apart from technical training, will be reduced by at least  100. &amp; .Vote 1 : Pay.1921/22 1922/23Gross Estimate.  4,899,000 4,930,000Net Estimate.  4,794,000 4,101,300Inc.21,000      Dec.     692,7004 6. The apparent reduction in net estimates is due to repayments from Middle East Vote, but is still a charge on the Taxpayer.We deal with the rates of pay of all three Services in a later report, and it is only necessary at this stage to refer to the additional pay which Air Officers receive as compared with officers of equivalent rank in the Army. The difference, which is presumably for flying risk, may be stated roughly as varying from 5s. to 10s. per day -probably represents roughly from  150,000 to  200,000 per annum : and in view of the immense strides which aviation has made it is doubted whether this large difference on grounds of &quot;risk&quot; can be justified. Medical Officers even in the Air Force are paid slightly higher rates than Medical Officers in the Army, on the ground that they may have to fly. Further, the pensions to dependents are a form of insurance, and we suggest an investigation by actuarial and insurance experts into this question of extra pay for flying risk and the grades to which it should be given.N.B. We have made enquiries as to the rates of insurance for flying risk, and, so far as we can ascertain, a premium of  200,000 would cover  4,000,000 of risk, so that on that ground alone we think that this item should be kept under review.The cost of recruiting for the Air Force appears to us to be very high, namely,  26,350 for next year, and the matter has been fully discussed with the Chief of the Air Staff. As a consequence the Air Ministry have seen their way to reduce their estimate of the cost of recruiting to  14,010, which is, however. equivalent to  7 per head per accepted Airman, and still seems high.Vote 2: Rations, Clothing, &amp;c1921/22 1922/23ReductionGross Estimate.  3,143,000 2,465,000678,000Net Estimate.  3,105,000 2,059,0001,046,0007. The charges for provisions and transport account for a large percentage of his Vote. The provisions are inainly obtained through the Army so as to obtain the lenefit of the Army&apos;s larger contracts. Clothing costs something over  200,000 per pmum. The present arrangements as to clothing provide for the issue of a complete ree kit on joining and an upkeep allowance of 8d. per day, equal to  12 3s,. Ad. per finnum. As in the case of the Navy and Army, we think this should be reduced by e-third and a lower standard of upkeep accepted. All civilians have had to make eir clothes last longer, and we see no reason why uniformed men should not.We desire also to call attention to the Travelling Concessions, whereby, as in e case of the other Fighting Services, officers and men of the Air Force obtain turn tickets at a single fare, the difference being paid by the Air Ministry. There ems to us to be no sufficient reason for the continuance of this concession, which was t given by the Government to the Fighting Services before the War.ote 3 : Technical Equipment.8. One of the large items of Expenditure in the Air Ministry Votes is forchnical equipment, ider : 1921/22 1922/23The estimate for 1922/23 compared with that for 1921/22 is asGross Estimate.  4,058,000 2,383,500Reduction1,674,500Net Estimate.  3,758,000 1,352.0002,406,000[7348]K
The large difference between the gross and net estimates for 1922/23 is accounted for by Appropriations-in-Aid of upwards of  1,000,000, mainly repayments in respect of operations in India at the cost of that country, and in Mesopotamia at the cost of the taxpayer. The redaction of the gross estimates is due to the reduction of reserve stocks, and to the estimated life of an aeroplane being slightly increased. The latter, if justifiable, is a real economy; but the reduction of stocks, with which we thoroughly concur, will hasten the day when stocks have to be replaced, and to -that extent the annual estimates of Departments do not reveal the true cost.We have given particular attention to the expenditure under this head. The estimate for 1922/23 provides for the following:-On present authorised number of Squadrons, and after allowing for 100 per cent, margin for Squadrons at home and 200 per cent, margin for Squadrons abroad, the Air Ministry states that an establishment of 1,934 machines is necessary (see Appendix (B) ); but if the number of Squadrons is reduced the establishment will i..e capable of a corresponding reduction.The same Appendix shows the number of machines in stock, and it appears that there will be in stock on the 1st April next 1,924 machines in excess of establishment:We. feel that the expenditure on conversion and reconditioning of old machines should be strictly limited to cases where satisfactory machines of a particular type required, or some other reasonably suitable type, are not available. We suggest for consideration the reduction of expenditure under this Vote by  1,000,000.The Air Ministry have also indicated their intention to ask for authority to spend an additional  500,000 on machines, stores, &amp;c, over and above the amount provided in the Estimate for Technical Equipment. This additional equipment is only required in the event of a serious war; and having regard to the pronouncement as to the unlikelihood of immediate war, and the argu-ment set out above, we feel that this expenditure should not be authorised.Included under the heading of Technical Equipment is a sum of  352,500 in respect of mechanical and other transport. The main items making up this total are the following :  With regard to the estimated expenditure of  95,000 for the overhaul of 200 vehicles by the makers, we are by no means satisfied that an average cost of  475 is justified. Obviously, if the number of the Squadrons can be reduced, a reduction in motor transport will be possible, and some of these repairs can be postponed if not abandoned.These items indicate where a possible economy could be made if work of this kind for the three Services could be centralised under one control.   The Air Force proposes to maintain a motor repair shop at Shrewsbury to be responsible for keeping 1,811 vehicles of different types in repair, and also to contract for the overhaul of 200 vehicles at a cost of  95,000 which are said to be beyond the present capacity o this depot. The annual charge for personnel and maintenance and upkeep of building is nearly  100,000, of which 47 per cent, is said to be expended on training driver and mechanics.  The Navy and Army also have training establishments and also le work out to contract. Only by co-ordination can the full economies from standardisation tion, centralisation of training, elimination of duplicate reserves of machines an spare parts and centralised purchases be secured.We have given attention to the position with regard to Motor Transport, as attach a statement (Appendix (C)) showing the Normal Establishment asked for b the Air Force at home and abroad, which, it will be seen, amounts to 1,7.61 moto vehicles. They have in addition to full establishment, which includes in man cases provision for reserve a total of 1,436 vehicles. These are mainly Tourin Cars, of which they have 164 surplus to establishment; Landaulettes, of which th have 34 surplus; and Lorries, of which they have practically 1,000 surplus.92 new machines.65 machines to be converted. 361 machines to be reconditioned by contractors. 184 machines to be reconditioned in repair depots.Purchase of armoured cars for use in Trans-Jordania Repairs and overhaul of 200 vehicles by makers thereof Spares and accessories including tyres, tubes, &amp;c.   ...50,000 95,000 142,000
Reduction        617,000 852,000Of the total amount of the estimate only  600,000 represents works which have not been commenced or in respect of which no commitments have been entered into, namely:  Reconditioning ..... ... ...      120,000Recreation facilities      ... ... ...        10,000Married quarters ... ... ...      200,000Miscellaneous services   ... ... ...      200,000In the present financial circumstances we are of the opinion that any sanction which may have been given for these works should be cancelled, and that the case for any new commitments under this head should be fully reviewed, as no serious harm would accrue if the bulk of these items were postponed for a few years.Apart from these new works, there are a large number of cases of continua-tion expenditure such as permanent roads, sick quarters, improvements to regimental accommodation, recreational facilities, &amp;c, and we think that every case of this kind should be reviewed and that the total Estimate should be reduced by  1,000,000.The largest work, which has already been commenced, raises an important question of principle. It is the provision of buildings at Halton to accommodate 2,000 boys for training as air mechanics, the total expenditure on which will reach some  720,000. Accommodation exists at Cranwell, where it is intended to train a further 1,000 boys, making a total of 3,000 boys under training.  -Under the present system the boys receive three years&apos; training and then serve seven years with the Colours and two years in the Reserve. The cost of training each of these&apos; boys for a period of three years is  711, so that an amortisation charge of  129 per annum or 7s. per day during the seven years of active service has to be added to the pay of the mechanics of the Air Force when arriving at their cost to the State. With the reduction in the strength of the Force, there will be a corres-ponding reduction in the number of boys to be trained, even if the principle of [7348] K we consider that the whole of these additional vehicles should be surrendered. The same remark would apply to Trailers used for Motor Transport, of which there is shown an establishment of 493, with 251 additional vehicles. The position with regard to Motor Cycles is .similar. There is an establishment of 512 Cycles and 316 Side-Cars, with a surplus of 195 Cycles and 248 Side-Cars, which also should be surrendered.It appears to us that the establishment for Motor Transport is throughout on an unnecessary scale, and that without difficulty the Air Force should be able to manage with a Normal Establishment considerably below that shown in the Appendix. For example, we consider that the establishment of Landaulettes should not exceed 2, instead of 18 as proposed, and that with the present number of Squadrons the number of Touring Cars should not exceed 120, as compared with a proposed establishment of 142, with 164 additional vehicles; and if the Squadrons are further reduced these numbers should be cut down proportionately. We note tnat the Touring Cars only average 360 miles a month, which appears to indicate an excessive establishment. With regard to Lorries and Trailers, we are of opinion that their use should be fully investigated, as it appears to us that the numbers on the establishment might be much reduced. The mere fact of having an excess of vehicles either serviceable or unserviceable, encourages wasteful use arid unnecessary expenditure on repairs.The Air Ministry propose to spend  50,000 on the purchase of armoured cars for Trans-Jordania. Both the Navy and Army used armoured cars during the war, and we consider that if at all practicable cars which were used in the war should be adapted for use in Trans-Jordania; it ought not to be necessary to buy new ones.Vote 4 : Works, Buildings and Lands.9. Like the two Senior Services, the Air Force asks for considerable sums for works and buildings. The amount proposed to be^ spent on works, buildings and lands in 1922/23 compared with the present financial year is as follows : Grosi Kstimate. Net. Estimate.   &apos;    1921/22 ... ...      3,048,000 3,018,0001922/23 ... ...      2,431,000 2,166,000
training boys as mechanics is adhered to. There is already at Cranwell acoom-modation which actually takes 1,300 boys, and in the present financial circumstances we feel that the expenditure at Ffalton should be very fully reviewed so as to see what use can be made of the money already spent, and that, without very full investigation as to the possibility of using other buildings or temporary accommodation, no further expenditure on this work should be incurred.If reductions are also made in the personnel of the Navy and the Army the possibility of using some of the accommodation which these services have for training mechanics, or existing school buildings to be vacated, should also be explored.The cost to the country of boys trained by the Air Force during their time as mechanics may be put as under : Per diem.s.    d. a.   d.Fay    ...         ...         ... ... 4   0 to 4 10Amortisation of cost of training ... 71 71Good conduct pay (say) ... ... 3 3Pension rights    ..... ... 14 14Clothing......         ... ... 8 8Lodging, fuel and light ... ... 9 9Rations........ ... 2   5 2   516   6 to 17   4 for 7 days a weekand possibly non-substantive pay and marriage allowance in addition, representing a further 5s. 8d. a day. This cost of approximately  6 a week for a single man and  8 a week for a married man is altogether excessive. The alternative policy of recruiting tradesman personnel from engineering shops throughout the country commends itself to us, and we recommend its adoption.Vote 5: Air Ministry.10. The following is a comparison of the estimate for 1922/23 with that for the current financial year : Net Estimate. 1921/22 ... ... ... ...      915,4671922/23 ... ... ... ...      825,000Reduction ...       90,467The Air Service is a new service, and is organised on different lines from those adopted by the War Office, as control is more centralised.We&apos;recognise that it is a highly technical Service, and it is not reasonable to expect that during the few years it has been in existence a final and stable organisation can have been evolved. An approximate appropriation of the staff of the Air Ministry for the next year was submitted to us as follows : Personnel concerned with the administration of theAir Force ... ... ....       ...      1,411Personnel engaged in research and inspection on behalfof the Air Force       ... ... ... ...        277Personnel    concerned    with    Civil    Aviation    andMeteorology .... ... ... ...        3622,050It is understood that the reorganisation of the Air Ministry is under the consideration of the Secretary of State with a view to effecting further economies than those shown in the sketch estimates submitted to the Committee. We feel that, having regard to the suggested reduction in the strength of the Force, and the suggested reduction in the monies to be available for experiment and research, and civil aviation referred to hereafter, considerable reductions in the numbers of personnel in the Air Ministry should be possible, and we are of opinion that the provision of  825,000 asked for should be capable of a cut to  600,000.
Reduction -     ... 324,000 212,000This reduction, however, is mainly accounted for because war liabilities have been liquidated, and the removal from charge of the Airship Factory at Cardington gives a reduction of cost; so that the real sUving is only about  40,000.In dealing with each of the Services, we have commented upon the extraordinary activity in the Department of Experiment and Research. There is probably more justification for continuance of experiment and research in connection with the Air Force than in connection with the older Services, but we feel that a case for immediate hurry has not been made out, and that some reduction in these activities should be possible without permanently injuring the development of the Service.   This expenditure would be more readily justified if the expenditureVote 8 : Civil Aviation.11. The amount provided for 1922/23, compared with 1921/22, is as follows :- 1921/22 ... ... ... ...      880,0001922/23 ... ... ... ...      700,000    :Reduction       ... ... ...      180,000This expenditure includes certain meteorological expenses, but is exclusive of  107,500 expenditure at Headquarters, partly in connection with Civil Aviation and partly in connection with Meteorology.Civil Aviation has not made the progress which its supporters anticipated, and, broadly speaking, it may be stated that at the present time there is no civilian flying between points in this country, the only regular services being the cross-Channel services, which are heavily subsidised either by the French Government or the British Government, the fares charged to passengers being very considerably below the economic level. There are certain commitments, representing subsidies of  200,000 per annum for the next three years, and certain expenditure in connection with Meteorology which must be incurred; but at the present time the amount spent on Meteorology at Headquarters and under Vote 8 amounts to more than  150,000 a year, which appears to be capable of some reduction. If the contribution towards Civil Aviation be limited to the present commitments and a reduction made in the cost of Meteorology, we feel that the amount spent under these headings could be reduced by  400,000.If the Air Force require a more complete and extended Meteorological Service, we consider it should be provided for on the votes of the Ministry other than &quot; Civil Aviation.&quot;Auxiliary (Territorial) Air Force.12. A proposal has been put forward for the formation of an Auxiliary (Territorial) Air Force. The amount originally asked for was  360,000 for 1922/23, with a recurring expenditure of  160,000 per annum; but it is understood that the Air Ministry feel that this force could be commenced with an expenditure of  167,000 and a recurring expenditure of  139,000.The desirability of encouraging the art of flying with a view to the formation of a Defence Force is recognised; but before any expenditure of this kind is sanctioned, we think that the whole question of the defence of the country should be reviewed. The War Office propose to spend  5,750,000 for a Territorial Force, and this force is primarily intended for defence against invasion. If the Auxiliary Air Force has the same object in view, we feel that, having regard to the unlikelihood of a great war, the country cannot afford a duplication of services of this kind. Therefore, if the Auxiliary Air Force is formed, it should be possible to make savings on the amount suggested for the Territorial Army. Here we are confronted with the dual and unco-ordinated plans of two services.Vote 9 : Supply and Research.13. The estimates for 1922/23 compare with those for the current year as follows: Gross. Net.   1921/22        ... ... ...      1,835,000 1.706,0001922/23        ... ... ...      1,511,000 1,494,000
on producing machines in bulk under the Vote for Technical Equipment is severely curtailed. At the present time, the item of Experiment and Research represents over 10 per cent, of the total cost of the Ministry, and these figures are exclusive of the staff in the Air Ministry employed on this work, which numbers 277.Included under the heading of Research is the cost &apos; of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, which is estimated to cost in 1922/23  360,000, after allowing for the value of the work, produced for the Air Force.*In addition to Farnborough, the Royal Air Force have an Instrument Design Establishment at Biggin Hill. It is now proposed to amalgamate the Biggin Hill establishment with Farnborough, thus effecting a saving of  37,000 not taken into account when the sketch estimates were prepared. It is difficult for us to indicate any particular branch of activity in connection with research and experiment which should be discontinuecr&quot;; but we feel that in the present circumstances a reduction should be made, and suggest that the limit of expenditure under this heading should be  1,000,000 for 1922/23, inclusive of all costs incurred at the Ministry or else-where, it being left to the Air Ministry to apportion this sum in the manner which is likely to be productive of the best results.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.) That the best way of obtaining economies which may be looked for from the full use of air-power in land and sea operations, and also economies in administrative, medical and educational Services, is by the creation of a Ministry of Defence as a co-ordinating authority.(2.) That the Air units allotted to the Navy and Army should be reduced by 8f Squadrons in accordance with our recommendations.(3.) That although we have no pre-war figure with which to compare the staffing of the Air Ministry and its establishments, considerable room for economy exists, both in administration and in policy. We have given a few examples in our Report, and, in particular, we recommend that the scheme of training boys at Halton should be abandoned.(4.) That, apart from the reductions in machines which follows upon our proposed reduction of the Air force allotted to the Navy and Army the provision in the Estimates for the re-conditioning of old machines and the purchase of new ones is excessive.(5.) That in all the circumstances of the case, the Air Force Estimates should be reduced from  15,500,000 to  10,000,000.In this recommendation no account is taken of any reduction in pay and allowances which the Government may decide to make, and no account is taken of any abnormal increase in the Non-Effective Vote, caused by a reduction of personnel transferred to the Retired List, with both of which items we deal separately in a later Report.

35 2T6Chapter IV.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS TO PART I.Redundant Officers and, Men of the Fighting Services.1. We cannot conclude our Report on the three Fighting Services without stating that the suggested reductions will necessarily lead to an increase of the &quot; Non-Effective &quot; Votes. We are of opinion that any such abnormal increase of the Non-Effective Votes might, in certain circumstances, be properly regarded as a special charge arising out of the war, and we propose in a subsequent Report to put forward our views on this point, not only in the case of &quot; Non-Effective Pay, but also in the case of such other items as War Pensions.Need for Immediate Action.2. The reductions in the Estimates which we have put forward for the three Fighting Services can, we believe, be realised by the measures we have suggested and by the practice of the most rigid economy in the Services. But it must be obvious that, reporting as we are in the month of December, these economies can only be realised in the year commencing April next if our Report is effectively dealt with in main outline without delay.The Committee has been limited in the continuity of its sittings only by the physical capacity of the staff of the Treasury from whom it has had the most devoted service to do the secretarial work involved.We believe that if the reduction of the Estimates on the lines suggested is taken in hand by the Departments with energy, the sums we have noted can be realised or even exceeded; but if delay occurs in giving effect to such of our major suggestions as the Government may approve, the saving cannot be realised in the coming year.i 7348 il
PART IIIntroduction to the Report on Government Expenditure on Social Services, namely, Education, Health, Labour and Old Age Pensions.The Provisional Estimates submitted to the Committee of the cost of these services in 1922/23 in Great Britain amount to over  124,000,000, being nearly four times the pre-war expenditure : 	1913/14, Audited Expenditure.	1921/22, Estimate.	1922/23 Provisional Estimate.Education Health Labour Old Age Pensions	  17,200,000 5,000,000 900,000 9,800,000	  60,500,000 29,000,000 21,500,000 21,700,000	59,300,000 27,900,000 14,500,000 22,300,000	32,900,000	132,700,000	124,000,000Ireland has been left out of account except for the training of ex-service men which under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, remains an Imperial charge.2. The reductions proposed by the Departments for 1922/23 as against 1921/22 amount to  8,700,000, or 6^ per cent. Disappointing as this figure must appear, it is doubly so when the fact is noted that it is actually less than the saving which will automatically accrue from the reduction in the cost of &quot; services arising out of the war.&quot; The services so termed in the Parliamentary Estimates are: (a.) The subsidy to private builders.(b.) The cost of certain transactions in housing materials. (e.) The cost of various schemes for the training, education and resettlement in business of ex-officers and ex-service men.These services were estimated to cost  18,642,000 in 1921/22 and  8,476,000 in 1922/23, a reduction of  10,166,000, while the expiry of the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; Act in May 1922 produces a further reduction of over  1,400,000 in 1922/23, as compared with the current year.The Estimates in respect of Orclinarv Services for the Board of Education show an increase of  744,000 over 1921/22 and Ministry of Health  3,352,000.It should be pointed out, however, that of the total expenditure of  87,000,000 in respect of education and health nearly  67,000,000 represents contributions towards the expenditure of local and other authorities. The bulk of these contribu-tions is now on the basis of percentage grants, and the Departments have no effective control over a large proportion of the money for which they ask, so that when pressed to economise they can do little more than exhort the various Authorities who are the spenders of the money and who alone have the opportunity to effect substantial economies, apart from policy.These percentage grants raise a question which in our opinion is of the greatest importance and one which is referred to more fully at later stages.  .3. The cost to the Taxpayer, exclusive of the additional burden borne by local rates, has grown from under 33 millions in 1913/14 to 124 millions in 1922/23. An. analysis shows sensational increases.

Various causes have contributed to these enormous increases and are dealt with later in the appropriate chapters of the Report, but there is one factor of administration which, in our opinion, has materially affected the cost to the Taxpayer, and that is the development of the percentage grant system. This system, which is common to Education and Public Health Services, has also been extensively applied in other Departments.Where in 1913/14 fixed or per capita grants were in force, they have now largely been replaced by percentage grants, while new grants introduced since that date have almost invariably been on the latter basis. The percentages vary from 20 per cent, to 75 per cent., the most frequent figure being 50 per cent.The advantage claimed for the percentage grant system is that it provides a stimulus to authorities to improve the efficiency of their services; in fact, it is a money-spending device.* The vice of the percentage grant system is that the local authority, which alone can really practise economy in these services, loses much of its incentive to reduce expenditure, especially when the larger proportion is paid by the Taxpayer through the Exchequer. The deciding voice as to what money shall be spent is not that of the Government or the House of Commons, but that of the local authorities. The Departments are thus in great difficulties in framing estimates, for these are based* Figures for 1922/23 not yet available, but will show an increase as compared with 1921/22 of - 4,000,000 to  5,000,000.Sanitary services, hospital and other personal health services, lunacy apart from pauper lunatics.[7348] &apos; -L 2
on anticipations not of what the Department itself will do, but of what hundreds of local authorities may dp. The weakness of divided responsibility is manifest throughout.If the Government were to attempt to impose a real and effective check from the point of view of efficient administration as well as audit, it would result in an enormous increase in bureaucratic control. It would mean a detailed scrutiny o: accounts and an examination of all new expenditure. This would tend to overload the central machine, diminish local responsibility and lead to greatly enhanced administrative cost. We do not suggest that the Local Authorities are negligent, nor do we suggest that they have not been directed to incur expenditure in conformity with a policy which, if left to themselves, they would not have incurred. We consider that the percentage grant should be abandoned in the interests of economy and be replaced by fixed grants or by grants based on some definite unit. Even though it were necessary to maintain the charge to the Taxpayer at its present very high level, which we do not admit, the change would, still, in our opinion, be very beneficial to the country by : (i.) Increasing the incentive to local authorities to economise, (ii.) Restricting the growth of the demands on the Taxpayer, (iii.) Enabling staff economies to be effected at headquarters.In the case of the grants to local authorities for housing purposes, the system adopted has gone even beyond the percentage grant at its worst. Here the local authority has lost all financial incentive to effect economy, because the annual loss in excess of a Id. rate, say, 14/15ths of the total, is entirely at the cost of the Tax-payer. Here we have a vast partnership in a property. The managing partner, viz., the local authority, has absolutely no financial incentive to economy, as no saving he effects redounds to his own benefit. The Taxpayer, through the Exchequer, pays the whole excess, which is estimated at 10 millions a year for 60 years.With these general remarks, we proceed to consider the estimates in detail.Chapter I.BOARD OF EDUCATION ESTIMATES. The Estimates for the Board of Education are as follows :  1913/14 (actual expenditure) ... ...      14,369,0001921/22............      51,014,0001922/23      ............      50,600,000It appears from estimates submitted to us that the total expenditure from taxes and rates on Education in Great Britain will in 1922/23 exceed a total of  103,000,000 :-From Taxes Board of Education Vote Scotch Education Department -  Local Taxation Moneys, &amp;c.

Out of the total Vote less than  1,000,000 is Administrative Expenditure of the Board. By far the greater part of the Vote of the Board of Education is dependent in one form or another upon expenditure incurred by Local Educational Authorities (of which there are no less than 317 in England and Wales) on a percentage grant basis, which, in our opinion, is a money-spending device, but not an economical system. The attached note on this subject from the Secretary to the Scotch Education Department, is most illuminating, and is given in Appendix (A).The following table illustrates the change which has taken place in connection with expenditure on Education falling on Public Funds (England and Wales) : Year.

The expenses chargeable to taxes increased by 239 per cent. The total expenditure increased by 168 per cent.For every   of total expenditure In 1913/14 the Taxpayer contributed 9s. 9d. and the Ratepayer 10s. 3d. In 1922/23 the Taxpayer will contribute 11s. 6d. and the Ratepayer 8s. Qd.Note. Scotland is not dealt with in this report, as the assistance given to Scottish Education auto-matically follows the assistance given to Education in England and Wales.Apart from the change in the proportions of expenditure, the two outstanding features in considering this Estimate are: (1.) The increase in teaching cost.(2.) The increase in the number of pupils receiving secondary education. 2. Details of the Board&apos;s Estimate are as follows : 	Audited Expenditure 1913/14.

The Estimate submitted to us provides for a net decrease on the Vote of 0-8 per cent, only, but if the service arising out of the war, viz., higher education of ex-officers and men, be omitted the 1922/23 Estimate shows an increase of expendi-ture from  48,766,315 in the present year to  49,510,000 next year, i.e.\ an increase of 1-5 per cent.ELEMENTARY EDUCATION.Expenditure-1913/14Estimates  1921/22 1922/2311,597,26036.998.713 36,723,9613. Observations on the Grant System.Elementary Education represents over 70 per cent, of the whole estimate. The very complicated grant formula, introduced between 1917 and 1919, is explained with an illustrative example in Appendix (B). Its practical working has exhibited in a high degree the peculiar disadvantages attaching to the system of percentage grants to which we have drawn attention in the introduction to this part of the Report.The net effect of the changes in the grant system is that the Taxpayer, through the Exchequer, is to-day paying 55 per cent, of the sums expended by local authori-ties on elementary education, as compared with 46 per cent, in 1913/14. If the Exchequer share were reduced to the statutory obligation of 50 per cent, the saving to the Taxpayer in 1922/23 would be-over  3,000,000.4. Cost per Child.The expenditure on Elementary Education in terms of cost per child is shown in following table :  Cost per unit of average attendance.-	1913&apos;14.		1919/20.		1920/21.		1921/22 (estimate).		1922/23 (forecast).		s.	d.	s.	d.	s.	d.	s.	d.	s	d.Salaries of tenchers	60	10	120	11	155	1	166	3	168	0Loan charges	11	4	11	11	11	11	12	0	12	0Special services 										Schools for defective children	1	&apos;)	.  8	6	5	2	5	6	6	0Medical inspection and treatment..	1	2	3	7	5	4	6	0	7	0Provision of meals	; 0	7	0	1)	0	10	1	6	1	6Administration	4	9 -	7	10	9	10	11	5	11	other expenditure	16	1	29	1	40	10	41	8	42	0Total	96  4	ti 16   6	177  8   17	7 7	229  11   !	0 0	244  12	4 4   4	247  12 :	6 &apos;   65. Cost of Teaching.The salary bill is directly affected by each of the following factors : -(1.) The number of children and the manner in which they are distributed among school buildings of different sizes. (2.) The size of classes. (3.) The salary scales.We suggest that economies should be effected under the above headings in the following directions:  (1). (a.) Raising of the Lower Age Limit.It has been submitted to us that when children who had not begun their school training until six years of age attain the school-leaving age they do not show any appreciable difference in their attainments or knowledge from those who went to school at an earlier age.  As reduction in numbers is one effective means of reducing
the cost of teaching, we recommend the raising of the lower age limit to six years. This should be made compulsory and not left to local option, as divergency of prac-tice would lead to dissatisfaction; moreover, we understand that outside London the Local Authorities would have little financial inducement to make this economy, and in some cases, owing to the complication of the grant system, it might be to their interest to have the children at school.The estimated saving to the Taxpayer through the Exchequer in 1922/23 is  1,785,000.(2.) (p.) Closing of Small Schools.Under the present conditions many small schools are being maintained at an unduly high cost per pupil, and we suggest that unless steps are taken to reduce the cost of Education in these schools powers should be taken to withhold the grant in cases where the children can equally well be educated at less cost elsewhere. We are informed that a saving of  60,000 can be effected by closing schools below 100 pupils in London, and that an additional saving of  142,500 in salaries might be made in urban areas outside London. The larger proportion of such schools are in rural areas and further savings should be possible there, but no attempt has been made to estimate such savings.(2) Revision of the Standard of Staffing... On an average over the whole country there were in June 1921 32-4 children to each teacher, which compares with 329 children to a teacher in 1913/14, and by itself involves an additional cost of  630,000.We are informed that if the standard of staffing were revised in urban areas so that there were in future one teacher to each fifty pupils, the saving would be  8,282,000, of which  4,853,000 would accrue to the Taxpayer.We suggest that a revision in the standard of staffing should be effected as rapidly as circumstances permit. Country districts present special difficulties in this matter, but there is wide field for economy in urban areas, where the average is very little higher than for the country as a whole.(3.) Teachers&apos; Salary Scales.We were informed that the present scales were framed by the Burnham Com-mittee, formed of representatives of the local authorities and of the teachers. The conclusions of the Committee are of direct importance to the Taxpayer, who bears from 50 per cent, to &quot;60 per cent, of the increased salaries granted, as well as the whole of any consequential increase in pension charges.Subsequent to the report of the Committee, the President of the Board of Education announced that the Government would pay grant on the basis of these scales where they were adopted by local authorities. Certain relatively minor changes as to the period over which the introduction of the scales should extend were made at the instance of the Government. The latest scales subject to certain provisions spreading over two years their application to existing teachers became operative from the 1st April last, but 35 per cent, of the local authorities have not as yet adopted them. It is therefore important to note that they are not universal in application, were not imposed by the Government, and that the local authorities pay what they think fit, subject to their not receiving grants in respect of salaries beyond the scales.The bill for teachers&apos; salaries is now more than two and a half times the pre-war figure. The Burnham Report provides that if the official figure of the cost of living-rises to a higher level than 170 per cent, above pre-war costs, and remains there for six months, the scales shall be open to increase. It omits, however, any mention of reduction when cost of living falls. The index number at the date of the Burnham Report (September 1920) was 161, wrhilst it is now 103. Reductions on the ground of the falling cost of living have been accepted recently by most classes of the community and this process is continuing. .We see no way of making the reductions necessary in national expenditure without, among economies in many other directions, reducing the expenditure on elementary education. This can only be done by raising the lower age limit by putting more pupils under one teacher and paying the teachers less, and we think the teachers and Education Authorities should be asked to face this fact.
6. Summary Elementary Education.Before completing our review of the Estimates for Elementary Education it is necessary to consider expenditure on it as a whole. The estimates of the Board under this heading, viz.,  36,723,000, are based on an anticipated expenditure by Local Education Authorities of  66,875,000, details of which are as under :  Teaching cost ... ... ...      44,975,000Loan charges ... ... ...       3,146,000Special services        ... ... ...       3,910,000Administration and other expenditure  ...      14,844,00066,875,000Teaching Cost.Having regard to our recommendations in the preceding section as to staffing, remuneration, raising the lower age limit and closing certain small schools, we consider that this item of expenditure can be kept within a figure of  36,000,000 instead of the  45,000,000 foreshadowed above.Loan Charges.No saving can be effected on Loan Charges.Special Services.The expenditure per child has increased from 3s. 6d. in 1913/14 to 14s. 6d. asthe forecast for 1922/23.   The total expenditure has grown in recent years asfollows :   1919/20      ...         ... ... ... 2,000,0001920/21       ...          ... ... ... 3,000,0001921/22      ...         ... ... ... 3,600,0001922/23.     ...          ... ... ... 3,900,000We think that this item should be capable of reduction to  3,000,000, the amount which sufficed in 1920/21.Administration and other Expenditure.The expenditure per child has grown from 20s. lOd. in 1913/14 to 53s. forecast for 1922/23.   The total expenditure has grown in recent years as follows :  1919/20      ... ... ... ...        8,900,0001920/21       ... ... .......      12,400,0001921/22      ... ... ... ...      13,700,0001922/23       ... ... ... ...      14,800,000We consider that this item should be capable of reduction to  11,000,000, which is over  2,000,000 more than sufficed in 1919/20.If the above suggestions are adopted, the expenditure by local authorities in 1922/23 recognised for grant would therefore be reduced to  Teaching cost ...      .... ...      36,000,000Loan charges ... ... ...       3,146,000Special services        ... ... ...       3,000,000Administration and other expenditure ...      11,000,00053,146,000We suggest that the necessary steps be taken to limit the grant for 1922/23 to  26,573,000, being 50 per cent, of the. above total. This represents a saving of  10,000,000 to the Taxpayer as compared with the Board of Education^ proposal, and if the total cost of Elementary Education is kept within the  53,146,000 there would be a saving to the Ratepayer of  3,700,000.
HIGHER EDUCATION. \Expenditure   1913/14        ... ... ... .. 2,015,000&apos; Estimates 1921/22        ... ... ... ... 8,970.0001922/23        ... ... ... ... 9,765,0007. Observations on the Grant System.The administration of Higher Education is more complex even than that of Elementary Education. This arises from two causes. In the first place, the subject matter is itself more complicated. Higher Education includes Secondary Education, Technical Education of various kinds, the training of the teachers- who are subsequently to teach in elementary schools, maintenance allowances given by local authorities to students at secondary schools and universities, and so on. Apart from this, however, the system is further complicated by the existence, side by side, of two sets of institutions, the one controlled by local authorities, and the other not so controlled. These latter do much the same work as the institutions controlled by local authorities, and receive assistance direct from the Board of Education and not through any local authority as intermediary.The system of grants for Higher Education resembles that for Elementary Education in general outline only.Local Education Authorities have a statutory right to receive not less than 50 per cent, of their expenditure on Higher Education if the substantive grants do not give them that amount. In practice, nearly all these authorities are in receipt of the flat 50 per cent, grant, and very few indeed are affected by substantive grants at all. On the other hand, Non-L.E.A.* institutions receive substantive grants on a per capita or other basis, and not a proportion of their expenditure.8. Secondary Education.(a.) Cost per pupil. We have been furnished with the following table showing the cost per pupil in grant-aided secondary schools (L.E.A. and non-L.E.A inclusive) :  	1912/13.		1919/20.		1920/21 (estimated).		1922/23 (forecast).

Od.)t Other payments include expenditure on books, stationery materials, library, examinations, prizes, games, &amp;c,* L.E.A. means Local Education Authority. For simplicity all grants to non-L.E.A. institutions have been treated as falling under Higher Education, though, in fact, a small proportion, less than  100,000, relate to Elementary Education.[7348]M
Some further light is thrown on the causes of the great growth in the cost of Secondary Education by the following particulars:: GrtANT-aided Secondary Schools.-	1912/13.	1920/21.	Percentage Variation.Number of pupils Number of teachers Average salary of teachers	175,752 10,5015  173	339,308 17,894  332	+ 93 H- 70 &apos; + 92The number of pupils has thus nearly doubled, due partly to increase of pupils in existing secondary schools, the opening of new secondary schools and the inclusion in the list of grant-aided schools of a number previously independent of either State or local control. A forecast for 1922/23 places the number of pupils at 385,000, an increase of 46,000 in two years.Up to 1920/21 the.average salary per teacher in secondary schools had not increased so fast as in elementary schools, but the forecast given above shows a rapid increase under the operation of the Burnham Secondary School scale. The average salary will shortly reach  389, an increase of 125 per cent.(b.) Free-place Students and Fee-paying Students. The Board&apos;s regulations provide that a minimum of 25 per cent, of the places available shall be reserved for free-place pupils from the elementary schools, and we think that in present circumstances this should be limited to 25 per cent.Even where fees are paid in respect of a pupil they do not on the average exceed 43 per cent, of the total cost of educating that pupil. We are informed, however, that since July fees have been raised in 500 schools and a revision is under considera-tion at 250 other schools; the increases have generally been about 50 per cent., e.g., in London fees are being increased from  9 to  14 per annum, and will be reflected in the receipts in the financial year 1922/23. They will still be a long way below actual cost. We recommend the fees should be substantially raised throughout, and at the same time every effort should be made to reduce the cost of Secondary Education. Scholars, whether fee-paying or not, should not be allowed to continue to receive State-aided Secondary Education if they do not show ability and industry, and effective periodical tests should be applied to ensure this elimination.(c.) Revision of Grant List. The recent great increase in the cost of State subsidised education is alarming. The condition of affairs when taxes and local rates were drawn on only to pay for the Elementary Education of the children of the working classes has been abandoned.Schools which could hardly be considered as requiring State aid are now receiving assistance from the local rates and the Taxpayer. We have in mind schools, such as Bedford Modern School, BlundeiTs School, Tiverton, and Berkhamstead Grammar School, which are on the grant list, and Dulwich College, which has applied for inclusion. We entertain great doubt whether the public ie aware of this development or is in favour of grants of public money towards the cost of educating children whose parents can well afford to defray the whole expense themselves. It could no doubt be urged that in some of these cases local authorities are supporting schools of this type because it is cheaper for them to do so than to set up secondary schools of their own. Nevertheless, we consider that the grant list stands greatly in need of revision.  &apos;(d.) Revised Classification of Schools.-An. extensive system has grown up under which local authorities, without assuming full control of non-L.E.A. schools in their area, yet contribute to their cost. From the point of view of the Exchequer, schools of this kind throw an additional burden upon it as compared with L.E.A. schools.First, they are receiving a direct grant of  7 per pupil from the Board of Education; secondly, whatever expenditure on account of these schools appears in the Local Authority&apos;s Annual Budget attracts a grant of 50 per cent. This arrange-ment is anomalous, it is expensive, and its continuance may lead to fresh demands on the Exchequer for increased assistance to those schools which are not thus favoured.We therefore suggest that where a school receives financial assistance from a Local Authority, the direct grant from the Board should cease and no further grant
should be made to that school except through the supporting Local Authority as an intermediary.This reform would save the Exchequer a charge of  500,000 per annum as compared with present conditions, and we think that with a closer financial interest in the matter the L.E.As. may effect further economies.9. Technical Schools.These schools are of the most varied description. The expenditure in 1921/22 passing through Local Authorities&apos; accounts on technical education may be summarised as follows :  Senior technical schools ... ... -    1:500,000 fSchools of art ... ... ... 550,000Junior technical schools ... ...        250,000Day continuation schools        ... ...        540,000Evening continuation schools    ... ...      1,350,0004,190,000A brief description of the system is given in Appendix (C).In addition to the above expenditure  142,000 is distributed by the Board in grants to non-L.E.A. technical schools.It appears to us clear that progressive developments should be post-poned until the financial situation of the country is better, and we think that the cost should be capable of reduction. In many cases we feel convinced that instruction in certain subjects, not connected with any future occupation, is being given and we consider that unless activities of this kind can be made self-supporting they should be rigorously curtailed.If a complete system of Continuation Schools is introduced, as contemplated in the Act of 1918, the additional charge can hardly be estimated at less than  10,000,000 per annum :- and in addition, there is the ultimate pension liability of  2,500,000 referred to in section 14.10. Training of Teachers.There are 18,542 full-time students in training to become teachers in elementary or secondary schools or teachers of domestic subjects. The average cost per resident and non-resident student to public funds is at present  79 per annum.In 1922/23 it appears that, including part-time students, the expenditure from public funds would be at least  1,700,000, of which the Taxpayer would pay  1,350,000.If our suggestions as to the revision of the standard of staffing in elementary schools are adopted, a reduction of the expenditure on training should shortly be possible, though, in consequence of students who have commenced courses being still in residence, the full effect cannot be felt in 1922/23. The question of fees paid by students should also be reviewed. These to-day are about  30 per annum for residents, and  5 to  10 for non-residents, and should be brought into closer relation with the cost.11. Aid to Students.Many Local Authorities now grant maintenance allowance to students from elementary schools in order to enable them to continue their education at secondary schools, and scholarships to older pupils proceeding to the Universities. The fees usually paid by the students may also be paid by the Local Authority. Such expenditure by the Local Authorities is, subject to certain restrictions, subsidised by the State to the extent of 50 per cent.For 1922/23 the Board estimate that the expenditure of the Local Authorities for this purpose will be  950.000, which will require a Government grant of  475,000.We understand that the Government grant towards these scholarships may eventually reach a maximum of  800,000 a year and we consider that the whole question of these grants should be reviewed.In addition to subsidising the activities of Local Authorities the Board also grant direct certain scholarships, studentships and exhibitions, the cost of whicih in 1922/23 is estimated at  215,000. In our opinion these should for the present be limited to the present holders.[7348] M 2

If, however, our suggestion in section 8 (d) is adopted, viz., that in all cases where a Local Education Authority assists a non-Local Education Authority School the whole of the State&apos;s contribution should be paid through that authority, the Local Authorities&apos; budgets will be increased by  1,000,000, making a total to be recognised for grant of  11,000,000.The grant in respect of an expenditure of  11,000,000 by Local Authorities would be  5,500,000, but as a sum of  800,000 is provided from local taxation moneys, the charge to the Board&apos;s vote will be  4,700,000.(b.)

This development, which is still in its infancy, appears to us another illustration of the readiness with which the State has accepted special obligations after it had provided fully for its liability by a percentage grant to Local Authorities, and we suggest that&apos; with the exception of the present holders of scholarships this scheme should cease.12. Summary.   Higher Educatian.As in the case of elementary education it is necessary to consider expenditure as a whole. The estimated expenditure of the Board under this heading is (a)  7,300,000 grants in respect of an expenditure of  16,200,000 by Local Authorities and (b) direct expenditure of  2,570,000 which includes -per capita grants to non-L.E.A. Institutions and Aid to Students.(a.) Grants to Local Authorities. The expenditure by Local Authorities on Higher Education has expanded with extreme rapidity.
192,4852,421,485   2,570,000Of the total of  2,570,000,  1,000,000 is in respect of assistance to non-L.E.A. Schools, and we have suggested in section 8 that in future this should be dealt with by the Local Education Authority. There remains, therefore, for consideration  1,570,000, and of this  1,000,000 is in respect of the training of Teachers in non-L.E.A. Institutions. No change under this heading can possibly be made until the end of the College year, and in these circumstances we can only suggest a reduction of this estimate to  1,350,000 apart from the transferred  1,000,000 to the non-L.E.A. Schools referred to above.The total provision on the vote for higher education in 1922/23 would thus be  4,700,000 under (a) grants to Local Authorities, plus  1,350,000 under (b) direct expenditure, making a total of  6,050,000.&quot;We accordingly suggest that the sum to be inserted in the vote in respect of higher education should not exceed  6,050,000. This represents a saving of over  3,500,000 to the Taxpayer as compared with.the Board of Education^ proposal, and if expenditure of Local Authorities is kept within the  11,000,000 there would be a saving to the Ratepayer of over  2,500,000.Miscellaneous Expenditure. 13. Sums to be Provided under this Head.To complete the examination of the Vote, the following miscellaneous items must be considered : 1921/22 1922/29Estimate. Estimate.   Scheme for assisting ex-officers andmen at universities ...         ...      2,248,000 1,090,000Museums         ...         ...         ...        260,000 210,000Board&apos;s administration and inspec-tion          ...         ...          ...         963,000 900,000Teachers&apos; pensions         ...         ...      1,575,000 1,920,0005,046,000 4,120.000Scheme for ex-Officers and Men.The scheme for assisting ex-service officers and men is a post-armistice measure which cannot in the view of the Committee be amended at this late date. It is a rapidly diminishing charge which must be left to work itself out.Museums.The museums under the Board are the Victoria and Albert, the Science Museum and Bethnal Green Museum. We suggest a 25 per cent, reduction on 1921/22 figure, viz., to  195,000.Administration and Inspection.As regards the Board&apos;s administration and inspection, we are informed that a closer estimate has been made and that the Board agree that the figure of  900,000 can be reduced to  879,807. In view of our suggestion as to the simplification of the grant system, we think some further staff economies are possible, and therefore suggest a reduction to  850,000 at once and a larger reduction in the future.14.

Teachers&apos; pensions are now provided entirely by the State, and no contribution is made either by the teacher himself or by his employers.We have considered a suggestion that teachers&apos; superannuation should be placed on a contributory basis. Under the pension system in force before 1918, which was confined to certificated Elementary School teachers, contributions were made by teachers at a flat rate, which represented about 2% per cent, of the average salary then current. The benefits under the present non-contributory scheme, which dates from 1918, apply to more teachers and are of much greater value than those under the old contributory scheme. We are advised by the Government Actuary that, expressed as a percentage of future salary, the value of the benefits under the present scheme to existing teachers, who are allowed to count their past service, ranges from 10 per cent, of annual salary in the case of a Man Certificated Teacher, aged 30, to nearly 60 per cent, of such salary in the case of a Woman Uncertificated Teacher, aged 50. The value to a Teacher now entering the service is on the average approxi-mately 8 per cent, of annual salary.The cost of the scheme, which will be  1,920,000 in 1922/23, will rapidly and continuously increase to a very high figure. The Government Actuarv estimates that by 1929/30 it may reach  4,402,000 a year, by 1939/40  7,667,000*&apos;, and ulti-mately  9,584,000; and, further, if a complete system of Continuation Schools is put into operation, it will add a further  2,500,000 to the ultimate liability, making a total of  12,000,000 per annum. The present salaries of teachers in pensionable service aggregate about  50,000,000, whereas when the non-contributory scheme was introduced in 1918 they amounted to  20,000,000. To-day, though the Taxpayer pays the whole pension bill, the Local Authority has control of the pay, the age of retirement and promotion of the staff, but no financial interest in the pensions cost affected thereby a most vicious principle.The full cost to the Taxpayer of the burden of teachers&apos; pensions was clearly not appreciated when the arrangement was made, in fact the Government actuary was not consulted.We recommend that a full enquiry should be held with a view to placing the superannuation of teachers on a sound contributory basis under which the teachers and the authorities who employ them would each bear a due proportion of the burden.Pending such enquiry we recommend thalt a 5 per cent, levy should be paid by the teachers. On the reduced salary bill which would result from our previous recommendations this would yield  2,000,000 in 1922/23.As shown above, the total of Miscellaneous Expenditure items can thus be reduced to  4,055,000, a saving of  65,000 apart from any contributions which may be levied in respect of teachers&apos; pensions.Financial Effect of Recommendations.15. Our suggestions on different portions of the Vote would produce the following result: Paragraphof Report, ,  6 Grant for Elementary Education ...      26,573,00012 Grant for Higher Education ... ...       6,050,00013 Miscellaneous expenditure     ... ...       4,055,00036,678,00014 Deduct superannuation contributions   ...       2,000,000Net total      ...      34,678,000This figure compares with the Board&apos;s estimate of  50,600,000.* It may be&apos; added that there would be a consequential saving of  2,000,000 on the Vote for the Scotch Education Department, making a total reduction on these Votes of  18,000,000.Grants to Universities and Colleges.1913/14, Actual Expenditure,  481,106 (including  37,483 for non-recur-rent grants).1921/22, Estimate,  2,000,000 (including  500,000 for a non-recurrent grant).1922/23, Estimate,  1,200,000.
Before 191&amp;/19, annual grants to Universities and Colleges were provided under many different Votes. From 1919/20 onwards, the expenditure, apart from certain statutory grants to Irish Universities ( 84,000), has been collected under a single head. The Treasury now fix the sum to be provided each year, but as regards the details of its allocation among the Universities, act on the advice of an indepen-dent Committee of Experts, known as the University Grants Committee.For 1919/20, a sum of  1,000,000 was provided for recurrent grants, and this figure was increased to  1,500,000* in 1921/22. The Treasury have requested the University Grants Committee to frame their recommendations for 1922/23 so as to bring the expenditure within a total of  1,200,000, being 20 per cent, less than the provision for the current year.Correspondence between the Treasury and the University Grants Committee has been laid before us, in which the case is set out on the side of the Committee for a larger grant. We appreciate the importance of a due measure of State encourage-ment to Universities, which greatly stimulates local support also, but the paramount consideration is national solvency, without which there can be no grants to Univer-necessities at all. In all the circumstances we recommend that a sum of  1,200,000  which is two and a half times the pre-war grant should be provided in 1922/23, subject to any reduction which may automatically follow the transfer of responsi-bility for Irish Universities and Colleges.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. As a result of our consideration, we are of the opinion: (1.) That of recent years the national expenditure on Education has iar exceeded what the country can at present afford. The cost of Elementary and Secondary Education per pupil has increased unreasonably. The incidence of cost has been transferred increasingly from the local Ratepayer to the Taxpayer, and this has had the serious effect of decreasing the financial responsibility of those who actually spend the money. The Board of Education Yote has since 1918/19 grown from  19 millions to  50 millions.(2.) That children should not be taken into State-aided Schools until they have reached the age of 6.(3.) That the cost of teaching must be brought down by the Local Authorities, and that the only way to effect this is to tell each Local Authority how much money it can have, and leave it to the Local Authority to reap thereafter the full benefit of any economies it may make, and we have suggested ways in which we think that such economies can be made. We are impressed by the position of impotence of the Board of Education in either controlling expenditure or effecting economies, once the policy has been determined. There is no doubt, on the other hand, that Local Authorities have been urged into expenditure upon a scale which they would not have contemplated if left free.(4.) That the grants for Secondary Education are providing State-aided or free education to a class which can afford to pay an increased proportion or even the full cost of education, and that children whose mental capabilities do not justify this higher and much more costly education are receiving it. We wish to make it clear that we do not recommend any serious reduction in free Secondary Education, but suggest that it should be confined to children whose mental calibre justifies it and whose parents cannot afford to pay for it.(5.) That as regards Higher Education generally and Scholarships, the expenditure is in excess of the nation&apos;s ability to pay, and mustjbe reduced.* In addition, a non-recurrent lump sum grant of  50(1,000 was made to enable Universities to improve the superannuation provision for their teachers.
(6,) That the Estimates for the Board of Education for the year 1922/23 should be reduced from  50,600,000 to  34,500,000 (which is approaching twice the 1918/19 provision), a reduction of  16,100,000, which, with the automatic reductions in Scotland, will yield  18,000,000, and we recommend that whatever proportion of the reduced sum is to be paid to Local Authorities should be so allotted by the Board of Education that the vicious results of the percentage grant system shall be terminated forthwith.(7.) That the question of Superannuation of Teachers should be examined, and we suggest that this should be put upon a contributory basis. We Yiew with alarm the liability under this head which is accruing, and which, we are told, may well amount ultimately to  12 millions per annum.We have suggested that a 5 per cent, contribution on salaries should be made by teachers, which would have an immediate effect upon the Exchequer, but the whole question should be gone into forthwith before the growth of vested interests makes it incapable of modification.APPENDIX (A).Note from the Secretary of the- Scotch Education Department. Percentage Grants in Scottish Education.Following the revision of the Scottish educational system, by the Education (Scotland) Act, the Scottish Education Department issued a Minute (the 11th April, 1919) . . . . &quot; that in respect of the year ending the 15th May, 1920, there shall be paid to each Education Authority grant equal to a certain proportion of that Authority&apos;s approved expenditure. Normally this proportion shall be 50 per cent., but the Department shall have power, if funds are available, to increase this propor-tion, or conversely, if necessary, to reduce it.....&quot;The expenditure of certain authorities grew so fast, particularly on salaries, that on the 9th July, 1920, the Department issued an amending Minute substituting for the words &quot; approved expenditure,&quot; the words &quot;expenditure in so far as it is approved by the Department for purposes of grant.&quot; Under this Minute they limited percentage grant on salaries to salaries covered by the Scottish Minimum National Scale a fairly low minimum scale applicable to the whole of Scotland and very much less than that in force in certain districts. The payment of percentage grants on salaries fixed by the grant receiving authorities themselves was thus eliminated.On the 30th June, 1920, a Minute was issued practically destroying percentage grants for any form of educational expenditure in 1920/21.Under their latest Minute of the 22nd April, 1.921, applicable to the year 1921/22, the percentage grant system has completely disappeared, and block grants are given based on the number of pupils and the number of teachers employed.
Present Method of Calculating Government Grant for Elementary Education.The grant formula, which dates from 1917, is best explained by illustrating its actual working in the last year (1920/21) for which full details are available.Calculation :   (a.)  1 16s. per head of average attendance ... 9,502,951(&amp;.) 60 per cent, of salaries of teachers ... ... 24,136,611(c.) 50 per cent, of special services      ... ... 1,487,208(d.) 20 per cent of other expenditure ... ... 3,097,687Total of above......      38,224,457(a.)

Add to bring the grant in certain areas up to50 per cent. ...         ...         ...         ... 611,341(/.) Additional grant in highly-rated areas       ... 209,751Total substantive grant for 1920/21   ...      32,897,316There are still more adjustments to be made, but the above is sufficient as an illustration.The two items marked (a) together act as a rate equalising device; a poor area, where the number of children is large and assessable value low, benefits substantially. A rich area with few children benefits little or nothing.It will be observed that (&amp;), the grant to teachers&apos; salaries, is nearly three-quarters of the whole net grant to Elementary Education.The &quot;special services&quot; (c), for which 50 per cent, is given, are the School Medical Service, provision of meals, schools for mentally and physically defective children, organisation and supervision of physical training, evening play centres and nursery schools; while &quot; other expenditure &quot; (d) includes loan charges, provision of maintenance of school buildings, administration of local authorities, enforcement of attendance, rent, rates, taxes, fuel, light, caretakers&apos; wages, stationery, apparatus, &amp;c.(&amp;.) The sum added to bring the grant up to 50 per cent, is provided to forestall the operation in a subsequent year of section 44 (2) of the Education Act, 1918, which provides that the total sum paid to an authority shall not be less than one-half of the net expenditure of the authority recognised by the Board.The &quot; deficiency grant &quot; to make up the difference is payable in the next year, but in practice it is forestalled as nearly as possible by a special addition to substan-tive grant in the year in question.  The areas concerned are few, but include London.(/.) The &quot; additional grant in highly-rated areas &quot; explains itself. In 1921/22 impoverished areas where the education rate exceeds 48t^., will get, subject to certain conditions, a special grant equal to half the excess of their expenditure over the produce of a 48ii. rateAPPENDIX (C).Technical Education.The following types of institutions are in receipt of assistance from the Exchequer and local rates : Senior Technical Schools.We are informed that these schools in the main are &quot;attended by students of 16 years of age and upwards, and that the great mass of the instruction offered is related to the occupations of the part-time students who attend.   There are also a[7348] N
Chapter II.MINISTRY OF HEALTH ESTIMATES.The Ministry of Health was formed in 1919, taking over the duties of the Local Government Board and assuming responsibility for the work of the National Health Insurance Commission for England and Wales.The Provisional Estimates for 1922/23 compare with the corresponding-expenditure in 1913/14 and with the current year&apos;s Estimates as follows:-	- 	1913/14.	1921/22.	1922/23.

Some of them are, or have been, engaged in industries which are in some greater or less measures dependent upon art. Teachers engaged in elementary or secondary schools improve their qualifications for teaching drawing or similar subjects by attending the schools of Art.Junior Technical Schools.These are full-time schools, the definite purpose of which is to enable boys or girls who have finished the ordinary course of an elementary school at the age of about 13 or 14 to attend school for another two or three years during which period they continue their education in ordinary school subjects, but also give a substantial part of their time to preparatory studies in relation to a particular occupation, e.g., engineering, dressmaking, &amp;c.Day Continuation Schools.The Education Act of 1918 provided for the establishment of a system of Day Continuation Schools, providing so many hours of instruction weekly for pupils engaged in ordinary occupations for the greater part of their time. Attendance was to be compulsory, at first up to the age of 16, and, after a lapse of seven years, up to the age of 18. The compulsory attendance to age 16 becomes law in a particular district when on the application of &quot;the local authority the President of the Board has fixed an appointed day for that district.This system has been only slightly developed, the areas for which appointed days have been fixed being London, Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon, Swindon, West Ham and Birmingham. West Ham and Birmingham have, dropped out and the London schools are now restricted to young persons aged 14 &quot;to 15.The President of the Board has announced that it is not his intention in the present financial circumstances to fix any further appointed days.Evening Continuation Schools.The main purpose of these schools is to enable young persons who have left public elementary schools, to continue their education by evening attendance for a period of about two years; while a considerable amount of instruction is already directed to the preparation of the student for the occupation he intends to follow. There is also an inter-mixture of studies having a more general aim.
Certain subordinate Departments, such as the Board of Control and the National Health Insurance Audit Department, are excluded, as well as the Scottish Board of Health.The increased expenditure on ordinary services next year will more than counterbalance the fall in the cost of services arising from the war (which include the subsidy to private builders).It is possible, however, that the recital of the bare figures may, in this case, give a somewhat misleading impression. We were struck, in the course of our examination of this Vote, by the fact that strenuous efforts have recently been made to secure savings, though these, unfortunately, are not sufficient to reduce the total of the Vote, owing to obligations previously incurred in other directions. Neverthe-less, over  3,000,000 have been saved by a restriction of the housing programme, and a further  1,000,000 by a reduction in the capitation rate paid to doctors under the Health Insurance Scheme.2. ADMINISTRATION. 1913/14       ............        593,8781921/22       ...... ... ...      2,298,7481922/23       ....       ...    ,    ... ...      1,564,000Reduction    ... ... ... ...        734,748 = 32per cent.. We have had submitted to us a very complete account of the administrative system of the Ministry, and are satisfied that vigorous steps have been taken to reduce expenditure or staff.There are points of detail, however, on which we wish to comment: -(a.) Medical Referee Consultants ( 100,000).This provision is in respect of thirty-six whole-time doctors and a number of part-time doctors who deal with appeals by Approved Societies against recom-mendations of panel doctors in cases where there is a dispute as to whether a man&apos;s health is such as to require sick benefit. They also supervise medical benefit and do a certain amount of general medical work for the Ministry of Health and other Departments. The whole-time doctors are on a five-years&apos; engagement as from October 1920. We understand it is hoped to reduce the sum of  100,000 provided under this sub-head to  85,000 gross, and to recover from Societies  7,500 by way of fees.It apj)ears that the referees are to some extent a luxury. The Societies might revert to the old plan of employing their own referees, which would be less expensive to the Taxpayer.If this were done, the position of these doctors should be examined with a view to ascertaining what it would cost to terminate their engagements and in the alternative whether it would be possible to transfer them to any other Govern-ment Department which requires whole-time medical staff, for example, the Ministry of Pensions, which has a large temporary staff.(b.) Index Clearance Branch ( 30,000).The position of this branch, instituted in order to meet an objection on the part of medical practitioners to the manner in which the funds available for medical benefit were distributed among individual practitioners, is under consideration by the Minister with a view to its abolition, if possible. Unless very strong reason can be shown for the continuance of this branch at public expense, we suggest that it should be discontinued. Such an ^arrangement is not now found necessary in Scotland.-(c) Public Health Services ( 198,000).This staff includes the doctors who inspect the various Health Institutions and whose services are required largely as a result of the State&apos;s percentage grant to the Local Authorities. If our suggestions in the preamble to this part of the Report for replacing percentage grants by some simpler arrangement are adopted, considerable reductions in staff should be possible here.[7348] N 2
(d.) Welsh Board of Health (Cardiff) ( 80,000)A Board of Health was set up in Wales, to which some of the Ministry&apos;s functions in Wales were delegated. This has led to unnecessary duplication of staff, and we are informed that  40,000 could be saved if the work were transferred to the Ministry in London, and we suggest that this change should be adopted.(e.) Alkali Inspectors.This staff, engaged in connection with the Alkali Works Registration Act, 1906, costs about  12,000 per annum, while the fees charged amounted to  4,158 only in 1920/21. We consider that legislative powers should be obtained with a view to increasing the fees to a figure sufficient to cover the cost of the staff. We are of opinion that services of this nature should as a general principle be self-supporting.3. HOUSING.The Estimate of  11,400,000 for Housing in 1922/23 is made up as follows :- Subsidy to Private Builders   ... ... ...       2,500,000Grants towards the deficit on Local Authorities&apos;Housing Schemes ... ... ...       9,500,000Discount on sale of Army Huts -       ... ... 20,000Improvement of Slum Dwellings        ... ... 130,00012,150,000Less balance of sales of Housing Materials overpurchases ... ... ... ... 750,00011,400,000Private Builders&apos; Subsidy.We are informed that certificates have been issued in respect of 42,000 houses in England and Wales involving a total subsidy of  10,000,000, which is in course of payment. Of this sum it is estimated that  2,500,000 will remain to be paid in 1922/23, which will complete the scheme. The Government are irrevocably committed to this expenditure, and we have no comments to make.Local Authorities, &amp;c, Housing Schemes. The Housing position under these schemes was on the 1st October as follows : Houses.Restricted programme  ... ... ...      176,000Number completed       ... ... ...       68,550Number in course of erection     ... ...       68,730Number not yet started ... ... ...       38,720The number of separate schemes for which tenders for building houses have been approved is at present 4,369, and we are informed that no material addition to this number is anticipated. These 4,369 schemes are in the hands of 1,272 Local Authorities, and we are informed that, apart from a few negligible cases, the Id. rate to which the financial interest of the Local Authorities is limited has every-where been exceeded.The following particulars show hoAV serious a burden the scheme has thrown on the public purse:  The average cost of each house will probably work out at 1,100 On which the loan charges represent about 6-8 per     Per Annum.cent., or      ... ... ... ... ... 75Towards this sum the net rents provide&quot; on the averageonly ... ... ... ... ... 16Leaving a deficit on each house of ... ... ... 59 ,The contribution from the locality is limited to the produce of a Id. rate, which works out per house at   ...     4which is the total contribution from  the local Ratepayer,Leaving the Taxpayer to find on each house ... ...         55 per&quot;ann.
Building costs have fallen recently, but the number of contracts to which the reduced prices apply is insufficient to affect the average materially.The sum needed for 1.922/23 is given as  9,500,000, and we are informed that the full annual charge on completion of the scheme will reach  10,000,000 per annum, and will continue for sixty years, subject to the following slight measures of relief: (1.) I&apos;n so far as the Local Authorities&apos; borrowings have been effected by short-term bonds they may be able to reborrow in five or ten years&apos; time at lower rates.(2.) The loans in respect of sewerage work have a period of thirty years.We are advised by the Minister that it is very unlikely that it will ever be possible to increase rents so as to reduce the charge. Rents are now fixed under regulations which were determined as the result of negotiations between the Ministry and Local Authorities. Under these regulations the initial rents must be based on the rents of similar houses in the locality, due account being taken of any superior amenities and of the increase of 40 per cent, authorised by the Increase of Rent Acts. In the event of a dispute between the Ministry and a Local Authority the case is referred to an Arbitration Tribunal. It appears unlikely, therefore that any material increase in the rent for these houses can be looked for.The lamentable and outstanding feature is the fact that local authorities who administer the schemes, subject to general directions from headquarters, have no longer any direct financial interest in economy. Their liability is limited to the produce of a penny rate which is greatly exceeded in nearly all cases. This is an extraordinary and anomalous position.The Ministry&apos;s regulations provide for creating a repair and reserve fund, and for allowances to Local Authorities as regards &quot;empties&quot; and cost of collection of rents.These allowances are, however, subject to review, and if they prove to be inadequate any increase in the allowances automatically increases the loss to the Taxpayer.We are much concerned at the heavy liability which has been assumed by the State, and feel that every possible avenue of relief should be actively explored. The only feasible method to reduce the annual charge of  10,000,000 appears to be the sale of the houses.If the houses could be sold at an average price equivalent to 50 per cent, of cost, the following would be the effect on the Exchequer :     *.   the loan charge would be reduced by one-half of 75, i.e., by       ... ... ... ...      37 10   0The net rent would be lost      ... ... ...      16   0   0Leaving a net saving of ... ... ...      21 10   0per house sold per annum.There would in addition be no further risk in connection with repairs, empties and non-collection of rent.This saving represents 36 per cent, of present loss and, if all the houses were disposed of on this basis, would be equivalent to  3,600,000 per annum,. Every house sold on this basis would be a real and permanent economy, whereas any economies from reduced rates of interest or increased rents are problematical and will be more than counter-balanced by increased charges for repairs and empties.The Minister of Health is in agreement with us as to the desirability of selling as many houses as possible. On the other hand he points out that while the Housing Acts give power to the Local Authority to sell houses subject to certain conditions they contain no power which enables the Minister to make the policy of sale effective.Furthermore, by Section 15 (1) (d) of the Housing and Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, the sales of houses are subject to such conditions as the Authority, with the consent of the Minister, may think fit to impose. This militates against a ready sale and keeps the price down at the same time. We accordingly suggest that the Housing Acts should be amended so as to give the Minister a free hand as regards the sale of houses, and that a well-advertised policy of sale should thereafter be adopted by him. If by an amendment of the Acts as recommended, houses were freed from&apos; all restrictions and sold in the open market, it is certain that a better price would be obtainable than at present.
A policy of sale appears to be the only means whereby the heavy burdens on the State in respect of housing commitments can be mitigated. To-day there is no finan-cial inducement to a local authority either to sell or in any way to reduce the burden of  55 per annum falling on the Taxpayer in respect of each of the 176,000 houses.4.

The percentages are non-Statutory, and should, we consider, be replaced by a system of block grants.The Ministry of Health concur in the view that from an administrative point of view it would be a great saving to get rid of the percentage grants basis. They point, however, to the practical difficulty of finding a substitute for it.We realise the difficulties, but if no more satisfactory unit basis for measuring grant can be arrived at, we suggest that the Government adopts the basis of previous expenditure, at any rate while the present financial stringency continues.Apart from the system of grant, the amount must be considered for 1922/23.Tuberculosis (maintenance):  1,489,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health.We suggest that the sum provided in 1921/22 should be repeated, viz.,  1,202,000.Tuberculosis (capital):  360,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health.We do not suggest any reduction. The explanation of the increase of expenditure on the Vote is that a capital sum, provided from the Old Sinking Fund of 1911 has now been exhausted.Maternity and Child Welfare :  1,162,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health.Here again we suggest that the sum provided in 1921/22 should be repeated, viz,.  1,042,000.Venereal Diseases :  424,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health. We recommend that this sum be passed for 1922/23.Welfare of the Blind:  85,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health. No change proposed.Port Sanitation:  50,000 proposed by the Ministry of Health. Until recently this was entirely borne by the locality and we suggest that the Exchequer grant should cease.

We consider that grants to Local Authorities or other Institutions should be given contingently upon no reduction in treatment, should be subject to review, and not be on a percentage basis.5. HEALTHExpenditure 1913/1.4 Estimate  - 1921/221922/23INSURANCE. 3,501,2558,842.550 7,802,000In reviewing the position of National Health Insurance, we have been greatly impressed by the fact, not generally realised, that very many and very costly alterations have been made in the original scheme on which the 1911 Act was based, and that, in the main, the Taxpayer has shouldered the burden, thus :-(1.) Medical benefit, i.e., the provision made for doctors and drugs, has been increased by successive steps from the original 6s. Qd. a head to 13s. 9d. a head, of which 4s. 3d. was at the sole expense of the Taxpayer and in addition to the normal State contribution which he as Taxpayer has also to provide. As from the 1st January next, the 4s. 3d. will be reduced to 2s. 9d., owing to the reduction of Is. 6d. in the capitation grant.(2.) It was found in practice that the sickness claims of women, especially married women, greatly exceeded the original actuarial estimate. The entire cost of remedying matters was put on the Taxpayer, a grant-in-aid of  350,000 a year, with retrospective effect being provided by the National Health Insurance Act, 1918. This grant is shown on the Vote of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee.(3.) In 1917 fears, which subsequent events have shown to be quite groundless, were entertained that the finances of many Approved Societies would be disastrously affected by the War. By the Act quoted above all Societies were required to pay one-eighth of their normal provision for contingencies into a Central Fund, from which the weaker societies were to be assisted, if necessary. To this fund the Taxpayer has contributed  150,000 a year for five years, which, with the contributions from the Societies, has produced a Central Fund of  2,000,000, not a twentieth part- of which has been required. Under an Act obtained in 1921 this-particular grant has been suspended.(4.) In 1920 benefits and contributions were both raised, but in addition to his share of the increased contributions the Taxpayer assumed full responsibility for a charge of  350,000 per annum in respect of the old Sanatorium Benefit, which up till then had been a charge on the Insurance Funds of the Approved Societies.(5.) Under the head of Administration above reference has been made to the cost of Medical Referee Consultants and of the Index Clearance Scheme. It does not appear to us that the Taxpayer should be called upon to pay these charges of the administration of the Insurance Scheme, which is in itself thoroughly solvent.We consider that a revision of. Health Insurance finance will be necessary, and in any such revision the points to which we have called attention above should be considered. The variation in the conditions of the scheme, could not lay the Govern-ment open to any charge of breach of faith, seeing that the original arrangements
have so frequently been modified in the interests of the other parties thereto, especially in view of the ascertained surplus dealt with in the following paragraph.Position of Approved Societies.The recent Quinquennial valuation showed that as, on the 31st December, 1918, in addition to the Central Fund of  2,000,000 referred to in previous paragraph, the individual Approved Societies held surpluses amounting in all to  14,000,000, of which  5,000,000 is held in reserve and  9,000,000 is at the disposal of the Societies for distribution in additional benefits, &amp;c. The reserve of  9,000,000 is made up of  7,000,000 Accumulated Funds and  2,000,000 being the two-ninths proportion of additional benefits payable by the State. These surpluses are largely due to the war. Owing to the inclusion in the National Health Insurance Scheme of members of all ages a reserve value for each member had to be created. As the original members die the necessity for creating a reserve value disappears and the large number of war casualties has consequently improved the financial position of the Funds of Approved Societies. At the same time the death of these men has placed a burden on the Taxpayer in respect of pensions to widows and other dependents. Neither have the Societies had to incur additional expense as regards wounded men because they were recouped by the State in full any extra cost incurred in excess of what they would have had to pay in respect of an equal number of men under peace conditions, i.e., they were entirely relieved of the special burden which War would otherwise have imposed on their funds, and, moreover, they reaped considerable benefits.As a result of the various modifications of the 1911 Scheme indicated above, the estimated Exchequer cost of National Health Insurance for Great Britain in the current financial year is approximately  10,500,000. The provisional estimate for 1922/23 is about  9,200,000. This reduction has been brought about largely by a reduction of Is. 6d. (11s. to 9s. ftd.) in the^ doctors&apos; capitation fee as from the 1st January next.While we note this reduction, we consider it is essential that the State&apos;s share of the Health Insurance burden should be further reduced by legislation.This could be done by increasing the total contributions from employers and employed by \d. a week in each case, and we recommend that this change be intro-duced on the 1st July next, betfore which date the contributions in respect of unemployed workers&apos; dependants will have ceased. It would also permit of the abolition of the Exchequer grant for medical services, and we suggest that this should be considered. As the increase in contributions is suggested with a view to relieving the Taxpayer, we consider these contributions should not carry any State grant. We attach a memorandum from the Government Actuary on the subject (Appendix (B)). The total saving to the Exchequer, including Scottish Board of Health and Joint Committee, would be about  2,200,000 per annum.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of the opinion: (1.) That both in policy and where administrative possibilities existed, successful efforts to economise have recently been made. We have indicated a few directions in which we think that further economies might be made. The principal items of this Vote appertain to the Housing schemes, which is entailing a cost to the Taxpayer of  10,000,000 a year for the next 60 years, and we recommend a vigorous policy of sale of these houses in order to reduce that burden.(2.) That no financial incentive to economy is given to those who are entrusted with the administration of this vast property. Economies in administra-tion and upkeep are entrusted to those who have no financial interest whatsoever in decreasing the loss on the undertaking they manage.(3.) That as regards National Health Insurance, the State has progressively accepted additional burdens and additional costs when they occurred) and has not reaped any benefit from the &quot;windfalls&quot; which accrued to the funds of the Approved Societies as a consequence of the War. We
think that, as soon as opportunity offers, such burdens should be transferred to the Insurance organisations, where they might well be compensated for, in part at any rate, by betterment in the actuarial position and that a very small increase in contribution should be imposed to meet the additional cost of medical and other benefits now borne by the State in excess of its proper share of two-ninths.(4.) That as regards Public Health Services, e.g., Tuberculosis, Maternity and Child Welfare, there can be no question as to the merits of the objects to be attained. There has, however, been a very large increase in this form of public expenditure since 1918/19, and, while we do not recommend reductions in this expenditure, we do feel that, having regard to the present financial position, the State&apos;s contribution next year, at any rate, should not be above the figure provided for the current year. The contribution should be on a lump-sum basis, and not on a percentage basis. We hope that, with falling prices and the greatly increased incentive to economy, the authorities responsible for this form of activity will be able still further to increase their beneficial work.(5.) That in view of the whole circumstances, the Estimates of the Ministry of Health and National Health Insurance Joint Committee for the year 1922/23 should be reduced from  24,269,500 and  350,500 respectively to  22,100,000 in all, and that any necessary legislation be promoted to take effect not later than the 1st July, 1922. This reduction is apart from any savings which may accrue from the sale of houses.APPENDIX (A).

Report by the Government Actuary on National Health Insurance.Government Actuary&apos;s Department, Wellington House, Buckingham Gate, The Right Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, London, December 5, 1921.G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P.Sir,1. In compliance with your request, I have considered various points affecting the charges borne by the State under the systems of National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance, and submit the following observations and suggestions.National Health Insurance.The present State Grants.2. Under the original scheme the contribution of the State, apart from the cost of central administration, took the form of a grant of two-ninths of the sums expended in payment of benefits and of the cost of administration.In 1913 there was added to this charge a State grant in respect of that part of the cost of medical benefit which, under the settlement then arrived at with the medical profession, exceeded the provision made for such benefit in the actuarial basis of the Act.In 1918 two further additions were made to the charge on public funds, namely, a grant to the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund, established by the Act of that year to assist the societies in regard to their liabilities to married women, and a grant to the Central Fund set up at the same time to deal with the more serious valuation deficiencies.The Act provided that the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund should be maintained wholly by Parliamentary grants, and in the case of the Central Fund a grant of  150,000 a year was provided.Under an Act obtained in 1921, this particular grant has been suspended in view of the large amount of the fund and the small amount of the claims at present falling upon it.3. I understand that your Committee is desirous of finding means of relieving the Exchequer from the greater part of its special liability in respect of medical benefit. If this object be attained, the State charge in respect of the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund will remain for the present as the only material addition to the original State grant of two-ninths of the expenditure. Present circumstances raise the question of the need for the maintenance of this charge; I deal with this question in a subsequent paragraph.The Cost of Medical Benefit.4. Taking up first the question of medical benefit, the statutory charge upon Insurance Funds for this benefit is 9s. 6d. a year for each insured person (Section 7 of the Act of 1920). The actual cost of medical benefit (which includes drugs and &quot;mileage&quot; allowances to doctors in certain circumstances) has recently been 13s. 9^. a year, the excess of 4s. Sd. over the sum charged to Insurance Funds being borne by the Exchequer. With the reduction of the capitation fee to doctors from 11s. to 9s. Qd. and other changes, this excess will be reduced to 2s. Qd. I understand that you propose that this 2s. 6d. shall be transferred to Insurance Funds.Pooling of Surpluses.5. I should not be justified in advising that the funds of approved societies could bear this extra burden without increase of contributions&apos;. It is true that in the last valuation period large surpluses were accumulated, but having regard to the influence of war conditions in the production of surplus, it cannot be assumed from this fact that there is any general redundancy in the contributions of which advantage might be taken. Collectively, no doubt, a substantial annual surplus can be expected under normal conditions, but the system provides for no collective responsibility as between societies. The surplus of each society is the property of the members of that society. It depends in amount upon the experience of the society, and this ,in considerable measure, is often a matter of administration.
Relatively to membership the surpluses vary widely, while in some eases there is no surplus at all; Resort to surpluses to meet a new general charge could only therefore be possible if a partial pooling of funds were adopted. This would amount to a fundamental change in the system of National Health Insurance, as laid clown by the Act of 1911. It would impose a serious burden on particular classes of insured people, and would be difficult to justify.Extra Contributions.6. In these circumstances I am compelled to advise that if the charge upon approved societies for medical benefit is raised from 9s. Qd. to 12s., the necessary funds must be obtained by an increase of the contributions.7. If the additional contribution carried the normal State grant of two-ninths of the benefit accruing from it, an increase of one halfpenny a week would practically suffice. This would give on the general average nearly 2s. per insured person per annum or, with the State grant, a fraction over 2s. (3d. a year. Whether the additional contribution should be borne by the employed or the employer is a matter for consideration; convenience would probably dictate that it should be paid by the employer.8. It is, however, to be noted that with an increase of the contribution by one halfpenny a week the full desire of your Committee would not be realised, since the State would still be providing something over (3d. a week towards the transferred 2s. (3d. To meet this I am led to suggest the alternative course of increasing the contributions by Id. a week, such amount not to carry any State grant. There is nothing in the present system which requires that every increase of contributions shall carry the State grant of two-ninths (or any other fraction) of the resulting benefits, and it is evidently futile to propose measures which, under another head, will add to the burden of the Exchequer a substantial part of the charge from which those measures are designed to relieve it. The amount produced by Id. a week without State grant would be nearly 4s. a head, and I should recommend that 2s. Qd. of this be applied to medical benefit, leaving nearly Is. (id. to be utilised in other directions, possibly under Departmental supervision, in giving&apos; approved societies greater financial freedom than they possess at present to give effect to Section 21 of the Act of 1911, relating to power to subscribe to hospitals, dispensaries, &amp;c, and to provide for nursing services.9. In the event of the joint contribution being increased by Id. a week it would be found advisable, Kpresume, to divide the amount equally between employer and employed. I do not overlook the practical difficulty that this might place upon some employers in respect of including a halfpenny in the net amount of weekly wages handed to the worker.   This is, of course, a point for Departmental consideration.Women s Equalisation Fund.10. With reference to the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund, the annual charge up to 1920 has been something over  200,000; with the increase of benefits, this charge may rise to  350,000 a year. If sickness experience, which is still subnormal, should rise to the average of the pre-war period, the cost will reach the full provision of 10s. a head for every married woman and may easily prove to be over  400,000 a year.Having regard to the other protective measures introduced by the Act of 1918, it appears to me that the need to continue this fund may properly be examined. It provides for certain extra risks arising among married women, but approved societies with women members are not the only societies subject to extra risks nor among insured women is the additional charge for married women the only special risk which has to be provided for. It may be argued with some force, therefore, that no particular reason exists for special recognition of this particular risk, at any rate if the recognition is to take the form of a grant from public funds exclusively.I have endeavoured to form some opinion from the valuation results as to how societies would have stood under normal conditions if this fund had not been created  remembering that in 1918 societies were given, in other directions, substantially more assistance than wras proposed by the Departmental Committee which prepared the basis of the Act of that year. The problem is one of some difficulty, since it involves an estimate of the abnormal factors produced by the war. I have, however, formed the opinion that the grants from the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund would not in any important case have been necessary to avoid deficiency. I am thus assisted in coming to the conclusion that if the societies, or the Department responsible for [7348] .&apos;&quot; 0 2
LOOthem, prefer to maintain a fund of this kind, there is no real reason for supporting it at the expense of the State. In regard to 50 per cent, of the income of the fund, the Departmental Committee recommended the pooling of a very small part of the contributions of insured women, and in the circumstances of the present time it would seem that if the Fund is to be kept it should be maintained on such a basis as this.******I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)        ALFRED W. WATSON.Chapter III.LABOUR.In 1913/14 questions affecting Labour were dealt with by the Board of Trade, the expenditure, including the cost of the Labour Exchanges and the limited Unem-ployment Insurance Scheme then in force, being  948,475. Unemployment Insurance and general activities in connection with Labour matters have developed to an extent which renders a comparison between the cost then and now of little or no value.The provisional Estimates for 1921/22, including Supplementary Estimates taken, and for 1922/23 are as follows: 1922/23.  9,779,200Ordinary services   ... Services arising out of the warTotal1921/22.  11,982,101 10,155,30422,137,4055,211,500 14,990,700It is by no means certain that the Estimate of  14,990,700 will be the final figure for 1922/23, as the staff in the Exchanges varies with the rate of unemploy-ment. The above Estimate is based on 6 per cent, unemployment of the insured persons. The rate of unemployment is subject to the widest fluctuations; it was 2-6 per cent, in June 1920 and 23 per cent, in June 1921; at present it is about 15 per cent.The analysis of the Vote is as follows : 	1913/14.	1920/21.	1921/22.	1922/23.Administration of all Services Unemployment insurant&apos;, &amp;c.

The numbers actually employed, however, in August 1921 were 26,847, of which 6,241 were permanent employees, and it is difficult to believe that the staff will be reduced by April 1922 to the estimated figure which is based on 6 per cent.. unemployment.Whilst showing a reduction in total staff it will be observed that the Ministry propose to increase their permanent staff from 6,241 in August 1921 to 9,283 in April 1922. We do not consider a period of exceptional unemployment as the most appropriate for settling a permanent establishment, and strongly deprecate any addition to the permanent staff at the present time.The organisation of the Ministry has already been the subject of investigation by several Committees, namely, the Peel Committee, appointed by the&quot; Cabinet in 1920 to consider the staffing of the whole Ministry; the Barnes Committee in the same year, on the working and administration of the Employment Exchanges; and an Inter-Departmental Committee in 1921, which reported on the establishment at Kew which deals with the Claims and Records of Unemployment Insurance. Each of these Committees suggested certain possible improvements in organisation, but, generally speaking, they were not able to report that any large block of work could be dispensed with, nor suggest any change of procedure which would secure substantial economies. There was, however, a minority report to the Barnes Committee Report signed by Sir Charles Sykes.There are two Departments of the Ministry to which special reference is called: Industrial Relations Department.The staff of the Industrial Relations Department of the Ministry numbers 97, some 38 of whom are located in various industrial areas. The original Estimate put forward by the Ministry for 1922/23 anticipated an expenditure in this Department of  87,100, but, since our discussion with the Ministry, it is found that this Estimate can be reduced to  65,716. The original Estimates averaged nearly  636 per person employed on this work; but it has been pointed out to us that work of this nature, if it is to be undertaken at all, must be in the hands of men of wide industrial experience and possessing tact to a considerable degree.A question of policy here arises: how far the Government is to continue to assume responsibility and intervene in trade disputes.The Minister of Labour explained to us that he regarded the main function of this Department to be one, not of intervention in trade disputes, but of avoidance of stoppage of trade by timely action when dislocation is threatened. With the knowledge that in the end there will be Government intervention neither side will have the same incentive to make the final proposals which might lead to a settlement of the dispute, and we suggest that the discontinuance of this branch of activity should be considered by the Government.Trade Boards Division.Another department of the Ministry is the Trade Boards Division, which has a staff of 126 at an annual cost of  34,785. Trade Boards were set up with the object of dealing with. conditions of employment, especially in sweated industries, but they now deal with unorganised industry generally. The working and effects of the Trade Boards Acts are at present under consideration by Lord Cave&apos;s Committee, and, pending receipt of their report, we do not make any recom-mendation.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Employment Exchanges.Labour Exchanges (now called Employment Exchanges) were established under &quot;The Labour Exchanges Act, 1909,&quot; their duties being what their name implies, to bring the unemployed workman and the employer seeking labour into contact. When the Unemployment Insurance scheme was launched under &quot;The National Insurance Act, 1911,&quot; the Labour Exchanges became the agency through which that scheme was managed, while still carrying on their original functions.Unemployment Insurance.The National Insurance Act of 1911 only applied to 3,750,000 people.The scheme, though extended during the War to munition workers, was for some
time after the Armistice overshadowed by Out-of-Work Donation. In the Autumn of 1920 the scope of the scheme was very much extended, no section of workpeople other than those engaged in agriculture and domestic service and certain industries with a low rate of unemployment, e.g., Government Service and Railways, being-left outside the scheme. The number of insured workpeople was in this way increased to 12 millions.A short summary of the various Acts affecting Unemployment Insurance is given in Appendix (A). Owing to the long period of good employment following the introduction of the scheme in 1911 the Insurance Fund accumulated &quot;over  20,000.000; but with the increased benefit and the largely increased number of beneficiaries entering at a time of serious depression this money has been exhausted, and the Treasury are now having to advance funds. Up to the present,  6,500,000 have been so advanced, and the Treasury have Parliamentary authority to advance money up to  20,000,000 in order to enable the Fund to meet its obligations.The present rates of contribution have been fixed at a level which the Govern -ment Actuary anticipates will produce a solvent fund by July 1923, at which date the question of a revision of contributions or benefits will have to be considered.By the recent Unemployment Workers&apos; Dependants (Temporary Provisions) Act, additional contributions are levied for the purpose of paying special benefits to the dependants of married workers. This scheme, which is to expire in May 1922, is financed independently of the Unemployment Fund proper and will impose on the Vote charges of  2,192,000 in 1921 /22 and  670,000 in 1922/23. We do not discuss the matter in detail as we are informed that the measure is an expiring one.The cost to the Taxpayer of Unemployment Insurance and Employment Exchanges (excluding the cost of the recent Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants Act) since 1912/13 is as follows : Administrative Cost (gross).*Appropriationfrom UnemploymentFund.Net Charge to Exchequer on Account of Administration,Government Contribution to Fund.Total Charge to Votes.&quot;&apos;. &apos;.:.r&apos;-	 	 	 	 	 1912/13	640,000  -	151,000	489,000	378,000	867,0001913/14	769,000	246.000	523,000	602,000	1.125,0001914/15	704.000	227,000	587.000	546.000	1,083,0001915/16	834,000	231,000	603,000	- 538,000	1,141,000 .1916/17	905,000	829.000	576,000	746,000	1,322,0001917/18	1,168,000	445,000	723,000	1,007,000	1,730.0001918/19	1.950.000	455,000	1,495,000-	994,000	2,489,0001919/20	3,013,000	459,000	3,154,000	1112,000	4.066,0001920/21	4,593,000	1,115,000	8,478,000	2,200,000	5,678,0001921/22	6,039,000	3,250,000	2,789,000	6,720,000	9,509,0001922/23	- 5,020,000	4,150,000	870,000	8.231,000	9,101,000In the Unemployment Insurance Acts there are two provisions which in our opinion increase the cost of administration unduly, viz. :  (a.) The refund to an insured person of the balance standing to his credit, with compound interest, on his reaching the age of sixty.(&amp;.) The provision, temporarily suspended owing to the great influx of new members, that benefit is definitely limited in the proportion of one week&apos;s benefit to six contributions.We feel that these two provisions in effect prevent Unemployment Insurance being really a Mutual Insurance in so far as the worker is concerned. They were doubtless necessary at the time that Unemployment Insurance was introduced, as the public mind was not accustomed to the idea, and at that time, without experience of the administration of an Unemployment Insurance Scheme, the disadvantages could not be fully foreseen. This was of far less importance in the original Act, as it only applied to 3,750,000 people. With a large increase in numbers, it may well be that administration becomes so unwieldly that modifications are called for.From the reports of the Committees which have investigated the working of the Department, and, indeed, from our own examination of the officials, we do not* Including Ministry of Labour Administrative! Staff, payments to Associations and expenditure borne on other Votes for buildings, rates, stationery and postage.
think that there is much room for minor administrative economies. Reductions can only be looked for by a modification and simplification of the system consistently with the maintenance of the solvency of the Fund.The present system involves a separate ledger account for each of the 12,000,000 insured persons, and complicated returns from every Exchange in order to keep separate, over the whole period of insurance, the contributions and benefits of each individual who, in so far as his own contributions are concerned, is only insuring himself, with the aid of his employer and the State, and is not really a member of a Mutual Insurance Scheme.Another factor contributing to excessive administrative cost is the need to keep an account in being for each person for five years after he has left an insured occupation, and if he re-enters within that period to link up his new card with his old account.  We are told that cases of this kind are numerous.Discrepancies between the insurance card and the account at Kew either in names or registered numbers cause considerable work, and in a year well over half a million such cases arise.The insured person has to rely on the accuracy of Headquarters records, and if each insured person asked for copies of his account the administrative machine would become much more costly. At the present time the staff in the Claims and Record Office at Kew numbers 3,745, costing  673,000 per annum.Our view that the scheme can be much improved from the administrative point of view is confirmed by a report from Sir Alfred Watson, the Government Actuary, which is attached (Appendix (B) ).We realise that this question is very far-reaching, and that no steps should be taken without the fullest investigation, and we recommend that a Committee of experts should be appointed forthwith to investigate and report on the best method of realising the administrative economies outlined above. Such an enquiry should, also cover the possibility of amalgamating Unemployment and Health Insurance, or at any rate utilising the same machinery with a view to reduction of the administra-tion costs. With the extension of Unemployment Insurance there seems to be abundant justification for investigating the j)ossibility of combining cards, records and administrative staffs for Unemployment and Health Insurance.We think that the suggested Committee should, also explore the possibility of placing Unemployment Insurance on the basis of Insurance by Industry.If such schemes could be widely adopted the work&apos; remaining would be considerably reduced, and this seems to us to be the only effective way of reducing the vast expenditure on Employment Exchanges. They are popular neither with employer nor employee, and their continued existence practically depends on their work in connection with Unemployment Insurance, but so long as the present scheme is continued we see the necessity for their retention in order to protect the Fund from improper claims. - We think, however, that they ought to&apos;be abolished, and probably could be abolished after some such enquiry and modification as we have suggested.Payments through Associations.Insurance benefits from the Fund are now paid in certain cases through the medium of Associations such as Trades Unions. These payments are made under section 17 of the Act of 1920, and the Unions receive Is. for administration expenses for every week&apos;s benefit they pay out. Unfortunately, from a variety of causes this procedure, instead of reducing the cost to the Taxpayer as originally anticipated, actually increases it, and the payments to the Unions for these services amounted to  500,000 in 1921/22.Unless a more complete scheme whereby each industry would look after its own unemployed can be introduced in the near future, the present arrangement should be reviewed.SERVICES ARISING OUT OF THE WAR.These services are for the most part concerned with the professional training of ex-officers and men of a fairly high standard of education, the industrial training of disabled ex-service men and some miscellaneous services such as grants for resettlement of men in business.We have considered details of the various schemes which are not set out at length for the reason that it appears that the majority are moribund, i.e., the last date of application is past, and such expenditure as will fall on 1922/23 represents the working off of obligations already undertaken by the Government
which could not be abandoned without a very serious breach of faith to individuals. The position of the scheme for the industrial training of disabled men stands in a somewhat different position from the others. The last date for application in Great Britain (31st October, 1921) is past, but there is still on the books of the Ministry of Labour a very large waiting list of approximately 30,000 men who are eligible for training but have not yet commenced training.The numbers actually undergoing training are as follows :  There are forty-eight Government factories having accommodation for training 16,000 men.The men during training receive very generous allowances. Whatever may be the level of their disability pension it is raised to the pension which the man would have been entitled to if he had been totally disabled, and allowances for wife and children are also paid : further, if away from home, accommodation in a hostel is provided or allowance paid in lieu thereof. In many cases the man receives more than the minimum wage to which he will be entitled when fully trained, and we think that without injustice the allowances are capable of some revision.The great majority of men in training are men disabled during the war, but a certain number of fit men have been included in the scheme of training.Obviously the Government never intended nor could they be expected to find training for all fit men, and we recommend that no further fit men should be entered for training, which would give, up to the termination of the scheme, a saving of  500,000.These savings cannot all materialise in the next financial year, but the recommendations of the Committee would tend to hasten the day when the expenditure under these schemes will come to an end.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion:- (1.) That so long as Unemployment Insurance is on the present basis, Employ-ment Exchanges are required as agencies for checking payments of Unemployment Insurance benefits, not as labour exchanges.(2.) That the present Unemployment Insurance Scheme is only partially a mutual insurance scheme, and is very complicated and costly to administer on that account.(3.) That a Committee of experts should be set up forthwith, with a view to simplifying the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, amalgamating Unemployment and Health Insurance cards, records, and, as far as possible, administration, and exploring the possibility of developing Unemployment Insurance by industry.(4.) That the scope of the Industrial Relations Department should be considered as also the work of the Trade Boards Division after receipt of the Report of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee, and that their transfer to the Board of Trade should also be considered.(5.) That subject to (3) and (4) the abolition of the Employment Exchanges and of the Ministry of Labour should be considered.(6.) That as regards Services arising out of the War, which are rapidly drawing to a close, there are directions where economies representing some  500,000 might be effected.(7.) That owing to the uncertainty which prevails at the present time and the direct bearing on this Estimate of the rate of Unemployment, the sum available for 1922/23 cannot be reduced below the amount shown in the preliminary Estimates.In Government instructional factories In employers&apos; works       ...

Unemployment Insurance (Temporary Provisions Amendment) Act, 1920.Further facilitated the drawing of benefit by new entrants in the first few months of the new system by substituting up to the 31st March, 1921, proof of employment in an insured trade in 10 weeks since 31st December, 1919, or 4 weeks since the 4th July, 1920, for the 4 contributions required under the temporary provisions of the preceding Act. The other conditions of benefit remained unaltered.9. Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921.Scope of Scheme.Unaltered, but a new claimant is regarded as insured if he can prove 20 weeks&apos; employment in an insured trade since the 31st December, 1919, with still easier tests for ex-service men, and, subject to the discretion of Local Employment Com-mittees, no test at all for disabled ex-service men.Summary of Repealed Acts.The number of persons insured under the above Acts was about three and three-quarter millions, and the accumulated funds prior to the gratuitous distribution initiated in March 1921 by Act No. 9 below, but &quot;consisting almost entirely of accumu-lations under the above Acts, amounted to approximately  20,000,000.
Benefit. iRaised to 20s. men and 16s. women, and limits entirely varied as follows : Two special periods, from the 3rd March, 1921, to 2nd November, 1921, and from the 3rd November, 1921, to 2nd July, 1922, were created, under each of which, 16 weeks&apos; free benefit was allowed regardless of contributions (i.e., one in six rule suspended for the period in question). As a permanent arrangement, the limit to benefit of 15 weeks in the year, contained in both the Act of 1911 and that of 1920, is replaced by one of 26 weeks, but without prejudice to the special periods.Contributions (further increases) Men-Employer ...

This Act established a distinct Fund, the Unemployed Workers&apos; DependantsBenefits.While entitled to benefit under the principal Acts, an unemployed worker receives, in addition, 5s. a week in respect of a wife or housekeeper, or, in the case of a woman, an incapacitated husband, and Is. a week in respect of each dependent child.Contributions.Men-Employer	2d.Man	2d.State	3d.Women 	Employer	Id.Woman	Id.State	2d.Other Points.The Act came into operation on the 10th November, 1921, and continues for six months, subject to prolongation, as regards the payment of contributions, if the Treasury and Minister of Labour certify that this is necessary to meet a deficiency in the Fund.The expenses of administration are to be met from the Fund itself.APPENDIX (B).Report by the Government Actuary on Unemployment Insurance.Government Actuary&apos;s Department, The Rt. Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, Wellington House, Buckingham Gate,G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P. London, December 5, 1921.Sir,I. In compliance with your request,I have considered various points affecting the charges borne by the State under the systems of National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance, and submit the following observations and suggestions.M. Ji. OA. M* -it- -it&apos;W -7V&quot; -VV* -7fUnemployment Insurance. The reasons for Central Accounting.II. I understand that one of the points which impresses your Committee in regard to Unemployment Insurance is the system of central accounting under which a separate ledger account is kept for each worker during the whole period of his insurance, and for five years afterwards. This entails the maintenance at present of fully twelve million accounts and the number must constantly increase for a long period.  The necessity for these accounts arises from two features of the scheme : (a) The provision that when an insured person reaches the age of 60 he shall be entitled to a refund of the excess of his own contributions over the benefits he has received, with compound interest;(6.) The provision restricting unemployment benefit to one week for every six contributions paid.The Refund System.12. It must, I think, be admitted that (a) is inconsistent with a sound insurance scheme. It involves the proposition that an insured person who is fortunate enough to have no occasion to make a claim can have his premium back, and therefore makes , the system a mixture of insurance and banking. But a scheme of insurance is afl expression of mutual effort, while the banking of money is individual saving. The two principles are fundamentally different and a scheme which professes to be-based on both of them cannot be regarded as one of true insurance.
The refund section first appeared in the Act of 1911 and when the Bill of 1920, providing for the wide extension of Unemployment Insurance, was introduced this provision was omitted. It was, however, reintroduced by an amendment made as the Bill was going through Parliament, It was considered, I presume, that the inclusion of such a provision softened what some regarded as a hardship, namely, the applica-tion of a flat rate of contribution to classes of insured people subject to less than the normal risk of unemployment. But if such were the motive the action taken was, I think, illogical, since the provision is not one for a class but for individuals, and has no relation to the question of the relative risks of whole classes. In any event the case of special classes has been substantially met by providing that particular industries may set up schemes of insurance of their own.If this provision were eliminated it would not only relieve administrative burdens at the present time, but it would obviate considerable additions to those burdens when in the lapse of years the refunds became numerous. Beyond this it would release about 3 per cent, of the income of the Pund, under normal conditions, this being the proportion of the contributions which I estimate should be put into reserve to meet the growing liability for refunds.If a change in the law is to be made in this respect the necessary action should not be long delayed, since otherwise vested rights will grow up and will be difficult to disturb.The    One-in-Sioc&quot; Rule.13. With regard to (b) the restriction of benefits to one week for every six contributions paid appears hitherto to have been regarded as an essential feature of a national scheme under which large numbers of irregularly employed people are brought into insurance. The provision is not based on Trade Union practice and first made its appearance in the Act of 1911, which provided for one week&apos;s,benefit for every five contributions paid. The provision is at present suspended, in view of the fact that severe unemployment set in before the great majority of insured persons had any material number of contributions to their credit. I am satisfied, however, that it provides an important check on undue claims and that its importance will be increased when an amendment made by the Act of 1921 comes into force and benefit becomes payable for 26 weeks in an insurance year instead of for 15 weeks as hitherto provided.While I recognise the importance of the purpose served by the rule I see no objection on actuarial grounds to the substitution of some other effective method of controlling the claims of individuals by reference to their general employment records.Possibilities of Dispute.14. There is one feature, common to both the refunds and to the practical application of the one-in-six rule, that seems to me to predicate serious future difficulty. In each case the rights of the insured person depend upon the state of his account which is kept by the Ministry of Labour and which he has no means of checking. I understand that there are administrative arrangements under which an insured person can at any time obtain a copy of his account without charge, and it is probable that insured persons endowed with wholly abnormal carefulness apply for annual statements and preserve them. But it is undoubtedly the fact and from the point of view of the cost of central administration it is fortunate that it is the fact that, in general, the vast majority of the twelve million insured persons take no action of the kind, have therefore no record of their position, and when the scheme is working normally will be wholly dependent upon the Ministry as to their benefit rights. This appears to me to raise very serious issues. It is useless to say in reply that the fault is with the insured. The workers of the country are compelled by law to contribute to the unemployment funds, and they ought to be entitled to receive their benefits under a system by which the normal man can satisfy himself that when his benefit stops it stops rightly. This is certainly not the case under the present system.Other Complications of the Present Scheme.15. Certain other features of the present system of unemployment insurance seem to me to add materially to the cost of central administration and to call for review in connection with any new proposal. The first of these is the need to keep an- account in being, for each insured person, for five years after he goes out of
insurance, and, if he re-enters insurance within that period, to link up his new card with his old account. It appears to me that as time goes on this will be a heavy undertaking. Every entry into insurance of a person of over 16 years of age will raise the question whether the person may have previously been insured, even if there is no explicit statement to that effect. If a previous period of insurance has to be assumed, the question will then arise as to when it ended. It may have ceased more, or less, than five years ago. If more, the old account is dead and no further action is required; if less, the account must be reopened and the new contributions carried to it. Considering the migrant character of large sections of the people, it seems to me that in course of years the obligation to carry out these operations must be onerous and costly.16. Another difficult feature is the procedure entailed in connecting the card . of each insured person with his account in cases of discrepancy in names or register numbers. From enquiries I have made I understand that well over half a million cases arise (from various causes) in each year in which the connection of card and account cannot immediately be made and a search has to be instituted. For this purpose and for the one mentioned in the last paragraph, an alphabetical index to the whole insured population is being constructed, and includes such identifying details as date of birth. I understand that in operation this index is very successful, but the amount of work which is entailed in its maintenance and use must be very great. I assume that similar difficulties are encountered by the approved societies, and I am prepared to believe that they do not overcome them so successfully as does the Ministry of Labour. But with the aid of their agents they succeed in dealing with them substantially, and if, as I suggest in the next paragraph, a single card existed for both forms of insurance, this matter might evidently be left to the societies.A ^Single Card for Health and U nemployment Insurances.17. It is a striking fact that since the Unemployment system was extended the e-ontribution record of each of 12,000,000 people under compulsory insurance has been practically duplicated, the approved society keeping one account (since practically every worker insured against unemployment is also insured on the Health side) and the Ministry of Labour keeping the other. In my opinion, such adminis-trative arrangements should be attempted, by co-operation, as to secure that one only of these records need be maintained, and with this, one contribution card used, instead of two. On the latter point, it is right to say that the Ministry of labour disputes proposed in 1919 that statutory powers should be obtained for the use of a joinl card, but the proposal met with objection in certain quarters and was not pursued.&apos;18. If these suggestions were adopted the contribution record of each person insured under both schemes would necessarily be kept by the approved society (or by the Ministry of Health in respect of the numerically small class of deposit contributors) and the title of the insured persons to unemployment benefit, so far as this depended on contributions paid, would be established, therefore, from the books of his approved society. This would necessitate the issue of certain certificates by the approved societies to insured persons out of employment. It does not appear that approved societies could be charged with any greater responsibility than this in respect of the payment of unemployment benefit; as at present constituted, they cannot be regarded as qualified to deal with the other points arising on entitlement to benefit.Suggestions for the Rearrangements of Unemployment Benefit.19. The primary object of any rearrangement of unemployment benefit will be to avoid the need to maintain a record of an insured person&apos;s contributions and benefits going back over the whole period of his insurance. In the case of Health Insurance, it is only necessary to refer to the previous year&apos;s contribution record to determine the benefits due when a claim arises. The duration of benefit is not affected in any case, save those of total suspension, but the weekly rate (for either sickness or- disablement benefit) varies according to the contributions paid. Under the Unemployment system the weekly rate always remains the same; the variant is the number of weeks for which the benefit is payable. It is possible that, in principle, this particular method is more suitable than the Health system to the conditions in which unemployment benefit is payable, and my recommendations are
Provisions would be necessary to meet the case of insured persons who became unemployed within the first three years of insurance, and to deal with the case of persons who are so irregularly employed that no scheme which is to be just to the regular worker could provide them with material benefits? The question whether weeks of incapacity for work through sickness or disablement should rank as weeks for which contributions have been paid as is the practice under the National Health Insurance system should also be considered.&apos; It would be for consideration whether the insurance year should run from July to June, thus corresponding with the present &quot; insurance year &quot; for unemployment purposes and with the contribution year of National Health Insurance, or whether it should coincide with the calendar year, which ds the &quot;benefit year &quot; under the Health Insurance system. If the latter were adopted some administrative advantage would be secured, but it would be necessary to provide for a &quot; stand-off &quot; period of, say, three months before benefit having once been exhausted could be resumed. As unemployment is at a minimum in the, summer, this point is of less importance if the insurance year ends in June than if it ends in December, though,, as a matter of principle, the question should be considered whenever the year ends. Under the present system a person, with the requisite number of contributions to his credit, who falls out of work in March and remains unemployed for 31 weeks, can draw benefit for 30 weeks continuously, i.e., 15 weeks in the insurance year ending in July and 15 weeks in the next year. From the financial point of view, the soundness of this is doubtful, while clearly it tends to inequality of treatment as between one insured person and another.20. It is evident that a considerable number of points must arise in filling out the details of any new scheme. These obviously require the attention of adminis-trative officers, and I do no more than to indicate the general range of such of the problems as present themselves to me.21. I recognise that under a scheme of the kind here suggested certain of the insured might at times, or even regularly in certain cases, obtain a greater amount of benefit than is possible under the operation of the &quot; one-in-six &quot; rule. It is, however, open to question whether this would necessarily be a disadvantage. It is a small element to be taken into account in resettling the contributions a matter which must in any case arise when the end of the present abnormal conditions comes in sight.22. I contemplate that, under the scheme suggested, the insured person on first becoming unemployed in the insurance year (and within the six &quot;waiting days&quot;) would obtain from his approved society a certificate in prescribed form as to the number of his contributions during the three previous contribution years. He would then deposit his certificate with the local unemployment office and it would be valid for the remainder of the insurance year. The insured person would be able to test its accuracy by reference to the contribution record card which every society is bound to supply to its members, and, on presentation, to post up yearly. In this respect the machinery for avoiding disputes as to an insured person&apos;s benefit rights already exists. The certificate would, of course, be subject to audit, and questions as to the right of inspection of societies&apos; contribution records, and of the responsibility of societies for inaccurate certificates would have to be considered. It is obvious, more-over, that suitable arrangements for the remuneration of societies would have to be made.based on the assumption that it will be retained. I submit the following scheme for examination :  (a.) The maximum number of weeks of unemployment benefit payable in any&quot; insurance year &quot; to be 15. ,(b.) The qualification for the maximum benefit to be the payment of 135contributions in the three previous &quot; contribution years.&quot; (c.) The number of weeks of benefit to diminish by 1 for each 5 by which thetotal number of contributions paid falls short of 135.Thus a person with 120 contributions to his credit in respect of theprevious three years would be entitled in the year to 12 weeks of benefitinstead of 15; a person with 90 contributions would be entitled in theyear to 6 weeks&apos; benefit; and so on, any fraction of 5 in the shortage ofcontributions counting as a complete 5.
Central Accounting under the System Proposed.23. In view of the migrations constantly taking place, and specially in order to protect the Fund from imposition, I think that the benefit record of each insured person relating to each insurance year would have to be kept centrally. So long as the benefits paid are subject to limits and are charged upon a common fund, this amount of central accounting seems to me unavoidable.24. Subject to the points I have mentioned for consideration in detail, and to any similar points that may arise upon examination, the suggestions I make appear to me to.hold out the promise of material simplification while complying with the canons of a sound scheme of unemployment insurance. A single card would obviously effect a great saving to employers, to the Post Office, to the Stationery Office and to the Labour Exchanges.Unemployment Insurance by Industries.25. The question of providing unemployment insurance on an industry basis has been frequently raised, but I am not aware that it has been closely examined. I speak on this matter with some reluctance, therefore, but it appears to me that the difficulties of defining and delimiting industries for the purpose in hand, and of deciding the particular industry to which a particular insured person is attached  especially at the critical time at which he is unemployed and requires benefit: call for authoritative investigation before a useful opinion can be formed as to the practicability of the project.As regards the great number of persons employed in highly organised industries, schemes of insurance might, no doubt, be readily arranged, and indeed for such the Act of 1920 provides facilities of which those concerned may avail themselves when the statutory suspension enforced by present abnormal conditions is removed. &apos; But in a national scheme provision must be made for everybody, and the question of the types and the numbers of those who cannot be allocated to any industry at once arises, with the further question of the risks to which these classes are subject, and of the extent to which the State would be involved financially by their segregation in a central scheme presumably under departmental administration. There is also the question of the proper allocation of the large number of workers whose personal (craft) occupation is constant, but whose industrial classification is liable to constant variation; a problem which, as the Reports show, has caused the greatest difficulty in censal classifications, and at times has been the source of much confusion in the endeavour to reconcile census figures with the classified records of the numbers of persons in various &quot; insured trades.&quot; Other questions arise on such matters as the duration of the responsibility of the Funds of particular industries for the less efficient workers who, sometimes after considerable periods, tend to drift into less exacting occupations outside those industries&apos;with a considerable enhancement of the unemployment risk. Financial considerations are here involved, and while the question of principle is of great importance the practical significance of the problem may be one of numbers and of the means available for measuring them. I am impressed by the size of this problem and by the insufficiency of the present existing data to supply material for its treatment, and feel that no definite proposals to place unemployment insurance upon an industry can be usefully made until the subject has been systematically examined from every relevant point of view.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed) ALFRED W.

Chapter IY.OLD AGE PENSIONS. The cost of Old Age Pensions in Great Britain has increased as follows : 1913/14. 1921/22. 1922/23.     Cost of Old Age Pensions(excluding Ireland) ...      9,821,000 21,750,000 22,304,000The above provision for 1922/23 includes  60,000 for the expenses of Local Pension Committees. Otherwise the cost of administration, amounting to about  1,000,000 for 1921/22 inclusive of Ireland, is borne mainly on the Customs and Excise Vote in respect of the salaries of Old Age Pension Officers and on the Vote for the Post Office, through which the pensions are paid. The cost of administration in 1922/23 will be somewhat less owing to the automatic fall of Civil Service bonus.The increase in expenditure is mainly due to the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1919, which was passed after an enquiry by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Eyland Adkins, M.P. That Act increased the maximum rate of pension from 5s. a week, as fixed by the original Act of 1908, to 10s. a week maximum and raised the means limit from  31 10s. per annum to  49 17s. Qd. A subsidiary cause of increase is the Blind Persons Act, 1920, which granted Old Age Pensions to necessitous blind persons at the age of 50 instead of at the ordinary age of 70.The cost of living figures are not at the present time appreciably below the rate prevailing at the date of the Committee&apos;s Report. The Old Age Pension was not intended to provide for the complete support of the pensioner, but to give partial assistance only. It may be observed that the grant of pensions has given appreciable relief to Poor Law expenditure in respect of aged persons who were formerly accustomed to seek maintenance in the Workhouses.The cost of administration largely arises from the enforcement of the means limit. The expense which would result if the limit were abolished would, however, be far in excess of any administrative economies which would result. We are satisfied that adequate safeguards have been adopted against the danger of fraudu-lent claims.In view of the foregoing considerations we do not consider that any reduction in this Estimate for 1922/23 is possible, unless the Government wish to reduce the amount of Old Age Pension now paid. This is a question of policy as to which we express no opinion.[7348]Q
PART III. Chapter I.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.1. All the services covered by the Vote of the Ministry of Pensions arise directly out of the War.The War Pensions commitments of the United Kingdom, excluding cost of administration and certain unimportant items of expenditure, have been estimated by the Government Actuary at  1,400,000,000, the rate of interest assumed being 5 per cent.In addition to the expenditure by the Ministry of Pensions, heavy expenditure has also been incurred by other Civil Departments in respect of schemes undertaken for the benefit of ex-officers and men, such as out-of-work donation, University education, training in professions and industries, assisted emigration and resettle-ment. Particulars are given in Appendix (A) of expenditure amounting to  112,000,000 &quot;for this purpose. If the whole expenditure on ex-officers and men and their dependants were collected into one head, it would appear as follows :  Capital value of War Pensions, liabilities ... 1,400,000,000 Schemes undertaken by other Civil Departments 112,000,000Total ... ...      1,512,000,0002. The comparison of the estimates submitted for this year and next year is as follows :  1921/22 net estimate     ... ...      111,556,6661922/23 net estimate     ... ...       96,365,000Reduction ...      15,191,666 or 13-6 per cent.The greater part of this reduction is due, however, not to a real decline in expenditure, but to the fact that the expenditure in 1921/22 was overestimated by  10,500,000. It was explained to us that this overestimate was caused by the Ministry making provision, which has not, in fact, proved necessary, for possible unforeseen and unexpected applications during the year.The gross estimate for 1922/23 may be analysed under its main heads as follows :   Pensions (excluding Parents&apos; Pensions) ...      67,170,000Treatment   ... ... ... ... ...      13,455,000Parents&apos; Pensions     ... ... ... ...       9,230,000Special Grants Committee and Miscellaneous Items 789,000 Administration ... ... ... ...        5,722,000 96,366,000The first head &quot; Pensions, excluding Parents&apos; Pensions,&quot; covers : (i.) Pensions, gratuities and allowances paid to disabled officers and men inrespect of themselves, their wives and children; and   -(ii.) Pensions to widows and children of deceased officers and men.The head &quot;Parents&apos; Pensions&quot; includes all payments to parents and other dependants (not being the widows or children) of deceased men.Pensions, excluding Parents&apos; Pensions,  67,170,000.3. The present rates of pension are embodied in various Royal Warrants and, generally speaking, are based on the recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions of 1919.   The rates are not permanent, but may vary with cost of living,
though the Warrants provide that no change shall be made before the 1st April, 1923, when revision will take place on the basis of the ascertained cost of living in the calendar year 1922. The standard for comparison is the cost of living in 1919 (115 per cent, above pre-war) and we are informed that for every 10 points fall the reduction in the pension charge will be at the rate of  3,124,000 a year.The Warrants, however, prescribe definite minimum rates of pension, and these will become operative when the cost of living has fallen to 77 per cent, above pre-war. At this point the maximum reduction Avill have been reached, and on the present pensions would amount to  11,750,000 per annum.It will be observed that the existing rates of pension were fixed before the cost of living had reached its maximum. The effect of the decision not to vary rates before the 1st April, 1923, is now operating in favour of the pensioner, but until recently it operated in favour of-the Taxpayer, and it would not be fair or equitable to suggest a review before the date prescribed in the Warrant.Treatment,  13,455,000.4. A disabled man is entitled to free medical treatment when it is certified that he needs it, and, if he is deemed unable in consequence to provide for his own support and that of his family, he receives treatment allowances in addition to his pension.It is estimated that in 1922/23  The cost to the Ministry of providing treatmentwill be ... ... ... ... ...       6,919,000And the treatment allowances paid will amount to        6,536,000Making a total estimated expenditure of ...      13,455,000This great expenditure, at a date so far from the cessation of hostilities, seems to call for investigation. It has been claimed that, apart from any question of a right to treatment, the expenditure is not wholly lost to the Taxpayer because the men&apos;s disabilities are reduced by treatment and the future charge for their pensions thereby lessened. But the prospect of further improvement from treat-ment, when three or four years have elapsed from discharge, appears to be small in most cases, and the War Pensions Act, 1921, embodies the principle of fixing permanent pensions after a lapse of four years.Treatment may be given in either a Ministry of Pensions Hospital, a Civil Hospital or a sanatorium; or. as an alternative, the man may attend as an outpatient at a Ministry of Pensions Clinic or at a Civil Hospital; or the man may be treated at home.In Appendix (B) tables are given showing in detail the number of men under treatment and the average duration of treatment. The salient facts are that the number under treatment actually increased between the 30th June, 1920, and the 30th June, 1921, and that over 500,000 individual spells of treatment are given annually, the average length of the spell being sixteen weeks.We are informed by the Ministry of Pensions that, in their opinion, the numbers under treatment reached a maximum about June 1921, and may be expected to decline in future. The following explanations of the increase between June 1920 and June 1921 are given by the Ministry :  (a.) In June 1920, there was a waiting list of men seeking treatment, especially in-patient treatment, which has been absorbed as more accommodation became available.(p:) The scarcity of employment which has occurred during the last fifteen months has affected appreciably the number of men seeking treatment, and has led to new claims to compensation being put forward by men on account of minor disabilities for which they had not made a claim before.As regards the second point, we refer to Appendix (C), dealing with the rates of treatment allowance.In view of the facts there given, it cannot, we think, be doubted that in many cases a man receives more, while undergoing treatment, than he could earn.if in health, apart from the risk, in the latter case, of unemployment.We consider that the question of the cost of providing treatment requires very[7348] &quot; R
early consideration with a view to effecting economies, and we make the following suggestions .as to the general lines on which economies can be obtained: (a.) The accommodation at Ministry hospitals is rather under 14,000 beds, though Treasury authority has been obtained for 15,000 beds, which was a great reduction on the demands made by the Ministry. The number of beds occupied on the 30th June, 1921, was 10,700, and unoccupied 3,300. We are informed that the accommodation is being steadily decreased as opportunity offers, but consider that much more rapid progress is desirable, as the proportion of unoccupied beds seems excessive.(b.) There are 11,856 beds in Admiralty and War Office hospitals in this country, of which 5,335 are filled and 6,521 are unoccupied. Altogether therefore, in these three Departments the Taxpayer is providing 25,856 beds, and of that number 9,821 beds are unoccupied. Immediate steps should, in our opinion, be taken to utilise spare accommodation in Naval and Military hospitals for pensioners under treatment, thus enabling buildings Hired by Ministry of Pensions to be surrendered.(c.) We are not satisfied that the fullest possible use is being made of civil hospitals. It appears that, including cost of accommodation, each patient in a Ministry of Pensions hospital is costing on the average 10s. lid. a day, whereas the capitation rate at civil hospitals averages 9s. a day. General surgical and medical cases should to a large extent, we suggest, be treated either in civil hospitals or in Naval or Military hospitals.(d.) The Minister proposes to make various reforms in the matter of treatment as and when pensions are made permanent; this, however, will be a slow process, and we think the question of introducing the reforms earlier should be considered. In particular, we think that the question of a strict limitation of home treatment should be considered, as it is admittedly unsatisfactory and leads to abuse.Treatment allowances are on a generous scale and become even more so in cases where a man is entitled to Health Insurance benefit, rank allowance or service pension. We consider, therefore, that these allow-ances should receive immediate consideration, as it appears to us that ample justice could be done with saving to the Taxpayer.As will be seen from Appendix (C), a man while in hospital receives 40s. a week, in addition to generous allowances in respect of his wife, and children, and out of this he only contributes 19s. per week towards his maintenance whilst in hospital. Having regard to the cost of his main-tenance in hospital of from 63s. to 76s. 5d. per week, we think an increase in this contribution can fairly be asked for.(e.) There are 1,883 orderlies employed in Ministry hospitals, which is equivalent to 1 orderly for 6 patients. This number appears to be very high, and we suggest that patients who are in a condition to do so should do more light work and thus reduce this heavy item of cost.Our suggestions, if adopted, should result in considerable savings, e.g. : If allowances were reduced by the amounts received for Health insurance benefits the saving would be roughly  1,000,000 per annum. If home treatment were reduced by 50 per cent, the;saving would probably be inthe neighbourhood of  500,000 per annum. If the allowance to the wife of a man undergoing treatment were made the sameas in the case of the wife of a totally disabled man the saving would be 10s.per week, equivalent to  416,000 per annum. If the contribution towards maintenance whilst in hospital were raised from19s. to 24s. the saving would be roughly  350,000 per annum.Having regard to the above suggestions and the further economies which would result from reducing the number of orderlies and making fuller use of Naval, Military and Civil Hospitals, we consider that the sum provided for treatment in 1922/23 might be reduced from  13,455,000 to  11,000,000.
Parents&apos; Pensions,  9,230,000.5. The Estimate for 1922/23 shows a reduction of  500,000 on 1921/22, the details for the latter year being : Number.	Description.	 211,940	Parents&apos;     &quot; Pre-War     Dependence &quot;		Pensions	5,994,21540,995	Parents&apos; Special Pensions	1,493,940105,665	Parents&apos; Flat Rate Pensions	1,377,67519,455	Other Dependants&apos; Pensions	458,6001,355	Gratuities	19,570379,410		9,344,0006,790	Officers&apos; Dependants	389,000386,200		 9,733,000&quot; Pre-War Dependence &quot; Pensions.The &apos;&apos;&apos; Pre-War Dependence &quot; of a parent is the amount regularly contributed by the man prior to enlistment in excess of any expenditure incurred on his account. The value of the support so given is loaded up by 20 per cent., and on the basis of this assessment the parent is given a pension of up to 20s. a week.The parent is not required to prove present need, and no account is taken of the probability that had the son lived the assistance given by him might have been withdrawn partially or wholly as he grew older and assumed fresh responsibilities on marriage, or when younger members of the family grew up and were able to assist the parents. Assuming, for the moment, that the conditions in the Warrant are right in principle and that proper effect has been given to them, it is easy to calculate the extent of the pre-war dependence of the parentsof men who enlisted. As the deaths numbered less than 700,000 and 211,940 pensions are in payment it appears that 30 per cent, of the men contributed to the support of their parents. The average pension in 1921/22 was 10s. llcZ. so that the pre-war support, allowing for the loading up by 20 per cent., must have exceeded 9s. a week. From the particulars as to wages prior to enlistment furnished by the Government Actuary to the Select Committee in 1919* it can be calculated that the average wage did not exceed 32s. a week.We cannot accept as probable the conclusion that 30 per cent, of the men supported their parents before enlistment, and still less the conclusion that out of an average wage of 32s. a week the man contributed more than 9s. a week to the support of his parents in addition to repaying any expenditure incurred on his account. We therefore think that too many of these pensions have been issued and that the sums granted to individuals have been excessive.The Select Committee of 1919 recommended that all classes of parents&apos; pensions should be assimilated on the basis of need and the reasonable expectation of what the son would have contributed had he lived. The Government did not accept this recommendation on the ground that it would have been a breach of faith with the pensioners. The question whether awards of pension based on pre-war dependence have been made on a correct estimate of the facts is another matter, and we suggest that a re-examination of these awards is called for, and a final date for application should be fixed.Other Pensions in this Group.The parents&apos; flat-rate pension is 5s. a week, granted to any parent who lost a son under 26 years of age, irrespective of whether the parent is in need or whether the son ever contributed support. It is a question of policy whether such pensions should be limited to cases of need, but, apart from this, we think it desirable that a final date for application should be fixed.* See H.O. 247 of 1919, page 513.
, Administration,  5,722,000.The estimated cost of administration in 1922/23, excluding  1,400,000 for the staffs of hospitals and institutions which has been included above as part of the cost of &quot; treatment,&quot; is made up as follows : Salaries and Wages. Travelling andIncidental Expenses.    Headquarters    and    regionalstaffs ... ... ... 2,690,000 81,000Medical staffs        ... ... 1,777,000 40,000Local committee staffs ... 934,000 200,000 5,401,000  321,000Numbers of Staff.Evidence was produced to us that, apart from the staff in institutions, there has been a steady reduction in numbers since May 1920, and that this reduction preceded the decline in the number of pensioners and has exceeded that decline in extent. Sweeping changes are being made in administration as a result of the War , Pensions Act, 1921, which converted the Local Pensions Committees from adminis-trative bodies to Advisory Committees, and also introduced the principle of fixing permanent pensions. Until these reforms, which should be pressed forward as rapidly as possible, are completed it will scarcely be possible to form a true judgment of the size of the staff required, but we think large reductions should eventually be possible, and we were satisfied that this possibility was very much in the minds of those responsible.We suggest that the pay of the temporary administrative medical staff of the Department, numbering 324, which averages  972 per annum, requires reconsider a-tion in view of the fall of the cost of living and the reduction recently effected in the emoluments of panel doctors under the Health Insurance Scheme.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.7. There is nothing we can suggest to reduce the provision of  67,170,000 for ordinary pensions until the time fixed for review in April 1923.We think that cost of treatment, parents&apos; pensions and administration can be reduced without inflicting any undue hardship, and we do not think it unreasonable in present financial conditions.We recommend in all the circumstances of the case that the Estimates for 1922/23 be reduced from  96,366,000t to  93,000,000, a reduction of 3  millions.f In view of the fact that the estimate has been prepared at an unusually early date, and that it is obviously a difficult matter to fix the figures correctly, we further recommend that the basis on which the estimate is compiled should again be thoroughly reviewed so as to reduce the possibility of overestimate. In 1920/21 and 1921/22 there have been overestimates exceeding  10,000,000 in each year.

General Rule.The general rule as regards treatment allowances is that a man under treatment and unable in consequence to support himself and his family has his pension raised to that of a totally disabled man.This rule applies without qualification to men receiving out-treatment or treat-ment at home. In the case of treatment in an institution the men are being main-tained free and the cash allowance paid to them is reduced by 19s. a week as corn-pared with that of a totally disabled man; if married, however, they receive 20s. a week in respect of their wife, whereas the allowance paid in respect of the wife of a totally disabled man is 10s. a week.2. Amount of Allowances.ii.) The minimum cash allowances (applicable to ex-privates) paid are: -	In an Institution in addition to Free Maintenance.

Rank Allowances are drawn in addition.   In the case of a man with a wife and three children the cash allowances would be increased as follows : 		Rank.

Value of Free Maintenance in an Institution. As the rate for a single man in an institution is 21s. a week as compared with 40s. for an out-patient, it appears that the value of maintenance has been put at 19s. a week. This is certainly a very low estimate; the cost to the Government is at least 63s. a week.(iv.) Other Sources of Income. In fixing the allowance which is to maintain the man and his family during his treatment, no account is taken of private income or of any health insurance benefit. The amount of insurance benefit drawn by mefi under treatment is, however, about  1,000,000 a year, i.e., it represents an addition of about 15 per cent, to the training allowances, which total  6,500,000 a year.  -3. Comparison of Family Income when Man is under Treatment with Family Income when he is in Work.Prom the preceding paragraph it appears that the minimum family income of a married man with three children in an institution is about  4 a week, viz., 60s. Qd. in cash, and free maintenance, valued at 19s.
When his treatment is over he reverts to ordinary pension, and out of 30,671 classified cases it appears that 19 per cent, draw no pension after.treatment. 36 per cent, draw less than 10s. a week. 63 per cent, draw less than 20s. a week. 83 per cent, draw less than 30s. a week.The average pension cannot well exceed 20s.To draw as much after treatment as during treatment it would be necessary for him to earn at least  3 a week, which is a high figure compared; with present rates in unskilled trades, ignoring the possibility of unemployment. Taking into account rank allowance and health insurance benefit, and the fact that maintenance is much undervalued at 19s., it seems clear that in very many cases the extra income during treatment is such as could not be earned in full employment.The position as regards a man receiving home treatment or treatment as an out-patient at an institution is not very different. The minimum treatment allowance for a man with three children would be just under  3 1.0s. a week, so that in the average case the man, in order to draw as much after treatment as during treatment, would have to earn 50s. a week, plus anything he would have been drawing in health insurance benefit or rank allowance during treatment.
CONCLUDING REMARKS.In bringing our Interim Report to a conclusion, we desire to emphasise once again the need for immediate action to which we have already referred in the case of the Fighting Services, and the essential importance of energetic. Departmental action in the matters with which we have dealt and which the Government may approve, if the savings are to be realised in the coming year.Over and above the  75,000,000 reductions which the Departments themselves have proposed for the year 1922/23, we have suggested in our Interim Report the following additional reductions :  Navy ... ........ ...        21,000,000Army AirEducation Health War Pensions20,000,000 5,500,000 18,000,000 2,500,000 3,300,00070,300,000We wish to point out, however, that this Report is both interim and preliminary s and that, as we have stated, no account has been taken of the possible re-casting of the Navy Estimates as the result of the Washington Conference, nor of any reduc-tions in the Army Estimates resulting from a review by the Government of our military requirements at home and abroad.In handing you this preliminary Report, we wish to state that we are proceeding with our examination of the ninety-six Votes remaining, which, with the Irish Departments, represent  138,000,000, and will report on them to you with as little delay as possible, as also on the various questions referred to, but not dealt with, in this Report.We are, Sir,Your obedient servants,(Signed)(Signed) G.
