[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maiesty&apos;s Government.]GERMANY.CONFIDENTIA][G. 2085^/508/18][November, 1.].Section 1.No. 1,Lord D&apos;Abernon: tq the Marquess Curzon, of Kedjestq-ji, (Received November 1.) (No. 1272.)My Lord, Berlin, October 25, 1921..I HAVE been endeavouring for some time to obtain an insight into the present position and the future prospects of the German budget. As was shown by&apos; Mr, Addisops despatch No. 1155 of the .14th September, it is extraordinarily difficult toform a clear opinion on the subject; statistical information is scarce and untrust-worthy, while even the most sincere estimates are falsified from month to month by the enormous fluctuations of the valuta and by the ups and downs of foreign trade.The enclosed memorandum is based upon the niost recent information available, and has been obtained from a confidential but reliable sotirce.A summary of the position is as follows : 192.1-22.Ordinary Budget Receipts ... Expenditure SurplusExtraordinary Budget-Receipts ... Expenditure Deficit..   GO milliard paper marks. 52      ,, ,,8 &apos;    ,,10*5 milliard paper marks. 41-0,    ,, 30-5    ,,* Forecast based on receipts for first five months of 19.21-22.There will therefore be a net deficit of 22 milliards on the combined ordinary and extraordinary budgets, without. making any provision for the contributions budget, which includes reparation. The total expenditure on the contributions budget can only be estimated very approximately owing to fluctuations of exchange. It will certainly not be less than 50 milliard paper marks, and may well attain 70 milliards.Turning to 1922-23, the ordinary and extraordinary- budgets &quot;taken&apos; together should show an approximate equilibrium between expenditure and receipts, provided that Wirth&apos;s fifteen new tax schemes come into force. It is not anticipated that there will be any surplus for the contributions budget. Payments due by Germany on &quot;this account dining 1922-23 are estimated to amount to 90 milliards of paper marks, or an amount approximately equal to the total receipts on the ordinary and extraordinary budgets. Against this expenditure no revenue is anticipated from existing or now contemplated sources of taxation., ...The prospect is, therefore, of a somewhat alarming character. It does not justify the hope that in 1922-23 any approach to equilibrium can be obtained if reparation at its present level is included in the German expenditure.Against a too pessimistic conclusion I would, however, say this : The real possi-bilities of the situation have not yet been fully explored. There has been no real determination to stop the printing press. There is little efficiency in the tax-collecting system, and there is very great timidity in putting a stop to doles and subventions.   &quot;&apos;In a word, the financial administration of the. country has been in weak and ineffectual hands. If a really able and powerful Minister of-Finance could be entrusted with the direction of Germany&apos;s finance I imagine he would soon put a different aspect on the position. Whether he would be able to provide, during the next three or four years, or even later, a revenue adequate to pay all charges oh the present basis must, however, remain very doubtful. INo one can form a correct estimate of the financial capacity of Germany until a serious attempt has been made to get to. the bottom of her tax-bearing capacity.[7264 a-1] d
The limiting factor in these matters, so far as my experience goes, is more usually found in the ingenuity and skill of the taxing authority than in the taxpaying capacity of the taxed.If ingenuity enough is applied an unconscionable amount of revenue can be produced. In Egypt forty years ago we attained a revenue infinitely beyond the expectation of all experts, native and foreign and English.In England during the war a revenue was collected which no serious authority would have considered d priori possible.But, in addition to ingenuity, time is required and determination. There are also two important, if not essential, desiderata : first, that the taxpayer should not realise too clearly the destination of his contributions, particularly if that destination is a foreign creditor; secondly, that the time the increased indirect taxation is imposed should not synchronise with the time that the taxpayer has to pay an enhanced price for what he purchases.   There should be non-synchronisation.Unfortunately both these conditions are difficult to fill in the present case.In conclusion, 1 desire to make all reserves as to the accuracy of the above estimates.   They are the best I can obtain, but that is all I can sayior them.On the other hand, I venture to think that the subdivision of the budget which I have adopted is an advance, as to form, on any previous presentment, and should enable the reader to form a fairly clear idea of the position.1 have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABER,NON.Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

The deficit on this part of the budget is somewhere in the neigh-bourhood of 7&apos;7 milliards, but this will most likely be covered by the extra yield of the present taxes, which ought to bring in about 60 milliards, provided the taxes continue to yield the same proportionate returns as those of the last five months.(B.) Extraordinary Budget.Receipts. 10&apos;5 milliardsObservations. The deficit is here 30*6 milliards. It is presumed, however, that there might possibly be an actual surplus on the ordinary budget of about 8 milliards (60-52), so that this would reduce the total deficit to 22-6, and without the reparation burden Germany would be able to float an internal loan to cover the deficits on the railways and posts.1 Original budget estimates.2 First supplementary estimates of July 11, 1921.5 Second supplementary estimates of September due to increase in salaries of officials. This total is made up as follows: 18&apos;9 milliards deficit on posts and railways. 14-2 milliards subsidies on food, &amp;c.5 milliards indemnities to German nationals of transferred territories.3 milliards increase in wages of officials of railways and posts.Expenditure. 41T milliards4
