SECRET.aP.-35I7.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE 01 IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 21st instant.General State of the Country.Uibs&amp;rv&amp;nee of. Truce.The actual machinery of the new liaison arrangements continues to work without friction. This is. rather implied than proved, since the new form of tabulated statistics has mot been long enough in force to have resulted in their arrival at Headquarters, but the decreased number of Headquarter cases may be justifiably attributed to local smooth working rather than to- any marked decrease: in the number of &quot; incidents.&quot; There is, however,, an aspect of the situation in Ireland which I view with growing concern. The amazing success of the truee during, the first period, the complete cessation of acts of violence of all kinds, was. I believe as surprising to the leaders of Sinn Fein as it. was to myself,, and it could hardly be- expected that, as weeks became months the early record would be maintained.. That it has not been maintained.must be admitted, and I am assured that this is as well known and as much deplored by the leaders of Sinn Fein as by myself. In reference to the acts of lawlessness themselves the main cause of alarm is-not the acts themselves, though they are often serious enough, but the impossibility in almost every case of discovering the identity of the perpetrators. In a number of recent eases which have been taken up with Sinn Fein Liaison Headquarters in Dublin lam satisfied that Sinn Fein Head-quarters have&apos; made most exhaustive enquiries and are themselves unable to establish the identity of the perpetrators or, while unable to say who committed1 any particular outrage, are themselves satisfied that members of the I.R.A. did not. The bond fides of&apos; Sinn Fein Headquarters I do not doubt, but none the less I am not prepared to admit that these outrages are not in some cases at least committed&apos; by members of their forces who-are out of hand. This may well be-so, and I have the best of reasons for knowing the almost insurmountable difficulty which a Headquarters encounters Avhen it wishes to bring home to individual members of its forces such acts of insubordination. At the same time it is certain that the truce itself, while handicapping the Police in exercising effective control, gives a golden opportunity to ruffians of all sorts to engage in unlawful activities with less chance of being caught than ever before, and such gentry find that to claim that they are I.R.A. not only aids them in their operations, but to- a certain extent helps to cover their tracks.I have urged this general view of the position in Ireland at some length before dealing with the actual facts- of the past week, as in my view it is most important that my colleagues-should know that against the opinion that our deliberations in London have a better chance of a successful issue if they be- im no^ way hurried must be weighed! the fact that the situation behind us in Ireland itself grows increasingly difficult, and- that while the forces of the Crown and the forces of Sinn Fein devote much of their energy to watching themselves and each&apos; other for1 fear of breaking the truce, between these two forces, each half paralysed owing to the presence of the other, a lawlessness dangerously akin to- anarchy is rearing its&apos; head.[7:498] B[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] -Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.
The most serious breaches reported during the week were the burning of Banmagull Coastguard Station, co. Kerry, on the night of its evacuation, the firing upon a patrol of two R.I.C. Constables near Corbeagh I.R.A. Camp, co. Longford, fortunately without result, and the disarming of a Constable in Cork City. In this latter case the Constable, while in a public house, wras set upon and disarmed by three men who said they were Republican Police. The Constable seized one of his assailants, but was struck over the eye and&quot; the men got away.Sixteen persons are reported to have been illegally arrested during the week, ten of whom are known to have been released. Of these, two men who had been arrested and tried by a Republican Court for stealing oilcloth were rescued by Police who visited the farmhouse in which they were detained and arrested six young men who were guarding them. Three revolvers, three shot guns and a Winchester rifle, all loaded, were found upon the premises. The prisoners were subsequently charged with assault and false imprisonment and with taking part in the proceedings of an unlawful and seditious pretended court. They were returned for trial at the Armagh Winter Assizes.Situation in Belfast.The situation in Belfast has gradually become more serious during the week. - A certain amount of sporadic firing took place on the 14th and 15th instant, but fortunately no casualties resulted. On the 16th and the two following days there was a certain amount of stone throwing at Roman Catholic workers, one young girl was struck and taken to Hospital, but was not detained. On the 18th a number of shots were fired at a spot where Roman Catholic and Protestant areas join, but fortunately there were no casualties. On the 19th instant a more serious situation arose from the assembling of rival crowds. Police and Military rushed to the scene. A number of shots were fired, but no injuries were reported to the Police. On the 20th four persons were admitted to Hospital suffering from gunshot wounds.On the 21st instant more serious rioting took place. There was firing in a Roman Catholic quarter in the centre of the city in the early morning and heavy firing in another Roman Catholic quarter during the evening. In the course of the day two Protestants were killed and one Protestant and one Roman Catholic were wounded. The Military were on this day called out in support of the Police. The situation in the city remains grave.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The results of 12 trials by Court-Martial were promulgated during the week, a conviction being secured in each case. Sentence of 30 days&apos; imprisonment was imposed in one case for the possession of ten rounds of rifle ammunition, and in another case the accused, who was charged with having a pistol and sixty-nine rounds of ammunition and pointing the pistol at Police Constables, was found to be insane and committed to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. The remaining trials comprised three cases of escape and seven of attempted escape from an internment camp, sentences of three months&apos; hard labour in two cases and one year&apos;s hard labour in the other case being imposed for the former offence. Confirmation of the sentences of nine months&apos; hard labour imposed by the Court in the seven cases of attempted escape was withheld by the Confirming Officer.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 19th instant: Total orders made     ... ... ... ... ...      4,388Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       243Releases ordered. ....        ... ... ...        737 I-        980&quot; Number of persons now interned ... ... ...      3,408The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 4.

Divisional Commissioner, Belfast, on a plan for the co-ordination into military units of unauthorised loyalist defence forces. The Divisional Commissioners explanation of the circular was that he had issued it under the orders of the Northern Government. The Irish Government had no knowledge of this circular until it was published in the press on the 19th instant. The circular has since been withdrawn by Sir James Craig.An interesting development is reported at Kilmallock, co. Limerick, where a strike has been declared owing to the refusal of the Farmers&apos; Union to pay a harvest bonus demanded, by a local branch of the Irish Transport Workers&apos; Union. Follow-ing a raid upon a farmers house and the arrest of the raiders by the I.R.A. authori-ties, the Union protested against the detention of these men without a warrant and[7398] &apos; . B 2
demanded their release. As this demand was not complied with, a general strike has.been declared in Kilmallock and the workers have been parading the streets carrying the red flag.An organised demonstration of considerable magnitude was made in&apos; Dublin and Cork on the occasion of the removal of the remains of Alderman Tadhg Barry, recently shot by a sentry in Ballykinlar Camp. No disturbances, however, atre reported in connection with the demonstration.Public opinion as to the outcome of the negotiations remains calm and confident, in spite of warnings against what is described, with some evidence of official inspira- -tion, as the undue optimism of the English press.On the 22nd instant the responsibility for the preservation of law and order was.transferred to the Northern Government. This transfer means that all opera-tions of all Police in Northern Ireland is now exclusively under the Government of Sir Janies Craig.H. G.Irish Office, London, S.W.1, November 28, 1921.
