(this Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET.CP. 1CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I see in the newspaper that as soon as M. Krassin&apos;s health permits, he is to have the privilege of a conference with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at Downing Street. I do not know the jjrovisions of this conference, but I do regard the present situation with the gravest possible anxiety. At my instance, and with the assent of the Cabinet, Lord Curzon despatched a Note to the Soviet Government protesting against their conduct and tireless activities against the British Empire. This Note was answered in an insolent document containing a tissue of lies, and we know that the Soviet Government knew that they were lying by the steps they have taken to correct the leakage which they realised had occurred.Lord Curzou answered the Note in a conclusive way, and I am not aware that any answer has since been received. Meanwhile the intrigues, organisation and propaganda still go on. Evidence comes in from clay to clay. Krassin is still in London. The Trade Agreement still goes on, and I regard the situation as very grave.I have been reading to-day an account given by Enver Pasha in Moscow at the end of: June, about the work that was being done under his auspices. I read of the relations of his organisation with the revolutionaries of Ireland, the Kopts in Egypt, the Christians in Syria and Albania, with great interest because it proves that although the association is pan-Islamic, it is allying itself with every kind of revolutionary movement. Enver gives an account of an organisation extending from Morocco to China, including such countries as Java, The Yemen, Somaliland, besides Afghanistan, Egypt and India. The account proves conclusively to my mind that this is done under the auspices of the Soviet Government and the Third International which they control.There is one small matter for congratulation in the account which I am sure the Cabinet would be glad to learn and upon which I dwell with satisfaction. Enver states that the organisers of revolution had not, till June, been able to get in touch with the revolutionary movement in India, thanks to the strict precautions taken by the English, and the careful watch kept in the interior itself. But I am bound to add that Enver goes on to describe the efforts that his organisation is making to get over these obstacles.I shall be glad to show the evidence to any of my colleagues.E. S. M.1st December 1921.4906     100 12.21
