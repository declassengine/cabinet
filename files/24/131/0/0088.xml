hi /KJ[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1921.SECRET. C.P. 35SG.-    CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues two telegrams 1 have received from the Governor of Bombay on the Turkish question.E.S. M.29th December 1921.Telegram from Governor of Bombay to Secretary of Slate, 23rd December 1921.Clear the line.Present situation iu India. The present situation is one of considerable gravity and one in which it is absolutely vital to peace in India that prompt settlement of Moslem grievances should be come to. No partial settlement will suffice, and I do not think that any solution less than that which I have previously suggested will be acceptable here. I am aware that in an international matter of this kind, it is impossible to anticipate the decision of Allied Conference, but if Cabinet could announce definitely what it. was going to stand for at forthcoming conference, it would have great effect. I still consider that the greatest dangers could be largely averted if Moslems were promptly pacified. There are signs that they increasingly dislike co-operation with Gandhi, but on the other hand the ill-effects of Khilafat propaganda are rapidly increasing.Please read in this connection last half of my telegram of 15th October&apos;8 on this question.I desire further to inform you that at a meeting of both halves of my Government this morning, all Ministers and Members of Council unanimously recommended that I should immediately address you in above sense by telegram.* From Governor of Bombay, loth October 1921.Moslem question. In view of present situation in India, I feel bound to urge once more upon you my opinion that it is imperative that action should be taken on the Turkish question, which should restore the lost faith of Islam in our attitude towards it. My point of view, and my anxiety to assist in this question, is well known to you from various private letters and telegrams that have reached you from me, but once again an opportunity, so it seems to me, presents itself in the exhaustion of both the combatants in Anatolia, and in other factors of the situation which should be taken immediate advantage of to put Englancfs position right. In regard to above, I have all along held view that, shorn of the Khilafat question, the non-co-operation movement is easily settled, but so long as all Moslems in India are either actively hostile or sore and distrustful, as they are at present, the situation will remain serious.We have now for very many months tried by patience and firmness to save situation from becoming worse out here, but I can only repeat what I have so often urged, that unless we get back to a policy of reconciliation with Islam the situation in India may at any moment become a grave one.I hope you will not think that I have misread either this situation or the home difficulties, but I have spent most of my life in studying Islam in Turkey and elsewhere, and I am absolutely confident that a continuation of our present policy towards Islam, or what appears to the public to be our policy towards Islam, will lead to results fatal to our rule in the East.4992      100   12.21
