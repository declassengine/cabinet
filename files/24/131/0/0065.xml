[This Document is the Property of.....His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]  - -Printed for the Cabinet.   December&apos; 1.921.SECRET.QCP.-3564.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 12th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.The general improvement in the observance of the truce by Sinn Fein to which I drew attention in my last report continues to progress satisfactorily. With the doubtful exception of one or two areas, notably West Cork and South Tipperary, there is everywhere manifest a growing disposition on the part of the Lit.A. to refrain from acts which constitute a direct challenge to the authority of the estab-lished Government, and in particular to avoid occasions of conflict with individual members of the Crown Forces.The only incidents of a serious character occurring during the week were. an attack on a police patrol near Thurles, Co. Tipperary, on the 9th instant, a bomb outrage on a railway train at Thurles on the evening of the same day, and the firing at and wounding of a Police Constable in Cashel, Co. Tipperary, on the 10th instant. All three incidents are still under joint investigation by the police and the local Sinn Fein liaison officials, and it is not yet possible to speak with certainty as to the facts. The attack on the police patrol is alleged to have been committed without provocation, and on the facts as reported by the District Inspector, who was in charge of the patrol, was undoubtedly a very flagrant act of treachery. According to this report, the patrol, while returning from the investigation of the burning of the house of an ex-soldier in the vicinity, passed a party of about eighteen men, evidently belonging to a local unit of the I.R.A., in three motor cars, which were drawn up in front of a public house. An exchange of greetings took place, con-ducted on both sides with civility and apparent good temper, but when the police had proceeded about 200 yards on they were surprised by a volley of shots, which rang over their heads, and, thinking that they were being attacked, at once returned the fire. Fortunately no member of the patrol was injured, and no casualties appear to have been sustained by the other side, who hastily made off in the opposite direc-tion to that in which the police were proceeding. A full investigation of the matter has been promised by the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, who advances the quaint suggestion, however, that the first volley fired by the I.R.A. party was probably intended as a complimentary salute- and not as an act of hostility!The train outrage at Thurles Station on the night of the 9th instant is one of the few serious breaches of the truce that have been charged against the Crown Forces, and although the facts as originally reported appeared to constitute a very strong primd facie case against the Police, the later investigations made on the spot by the Chief of Police, in conjunction with the local Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, have not resulted in the production of any evidence in substantiation of this case. It appears to be clear that only one bomb was thrown, but no witness to the act of throwing has yet come forward, and the only ground for the allegations brought against the police is the natural assumption that no members of the I.R.A. would be likely to throw bombs at a train containing to their knowledge a large number of released internees among its passengers. The Chief of Police very rightly points out, how-ever, that an equally credible explanation of the incident can be found in the supposition that the bomb was thrown from the train itself without malicious intent by some person who was unaware that the train had entered the station. In support of this view the Chief of Police mentions that another train with internees arriving at Thurles later on the same evening is reported by a military officer who was among its passengers to have been boarded during the journey by &quot;members of the[7502]
LEA. in a semi-intoxicated condition, who indulged in a certain amount of &quot;mafficking,&quot; breaking the woodwork of the carriages and firing revolver shots out of the window. As may be imagined,however,the Irish press and public were quick to seize upon the theory of the guilt of the police, but the public announcement issued by the Government promising an immediate enquiry and stern punishment of the perpe-administrators was well received, and was probably the means of preventing the incident from being turned to evil effect by the extremist section of Sinn Fein, who are opposed to peace. In view of the inconclusive nature of the joint preliminary investigation the Chief of Police proposed to the Sinn Fein Liaison Officer that the matter should be referred to a Military Court of Enquiry, and there is a possibility of this suggestion being adopted. The casualties caused by the bomb explosion were eight persons injured, two of whom were internees. The injuries in three cases are of a serious nature.The wounding of a Constable at Cashel on the 10th instant was a dastardly outrage, for which nor explanation has yet been forthcoming. The Constable was walking down the main street of the town with another Constable, when they were fired at from behind by two civilians, who then made good their escape. Both the Constables were unarmed. The matter has been taken up with the Chief Sinn Fein : Liaison Officer, who has promised to co-operate energetically in its investigation.Seven cases of illegal arrests were reported during the week. The motive in one case waslo prevent the person arrested from attending a Petty Sessions Court.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The results of three trials of civilians by Court-Martial were promulgated during the week, a conviction being secured in each case. Sentence of one years hard labour was imposed in one case for the possession of fifty revolver cartridges, and in another case sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour was imposed for the possession of an auto-pistol and six pistol cartridges. The remain-ing case was that of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment without hard labour for the offence of assaulting a Police Sergeant in the execution of his duty. To the above civilian cases should be added the trial on a charge of robbery of. four members of the Royal Air Force, two of whom were convicted and sentenced to three years&apos; penal servitude.Release of Internees.In accordance with a Cabinet decision of the 7th instant, all persons detained in Internment Camps in Ireland have now been released. This step has undoubtedly had a good effect in conciliating public opinion in Ireland and in strengthening the hands of the leaders of the peace party in Sinn Fein. The return of the internees provoked scenes of great enthusiasm in many places, but was marked by two very regrettable incidents in addition to that at Thuries, already mentioned, two of the special trains conveying internees from Ballykinlar to Dublin being attacked while passing through Co&apos;. Down by gangs of Orangemen, who assembled at various places along the line and fired revolvers, and threw stones at the passengers, three of whom received minor injuries.The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces:  State of the Police Fokces.Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.Strength on the 4th December, 1921 Retirements ResignationsDismissals or discharges ...4 18 1614,312Recruits (Ireland)Total wastage38 6Net decrease3232Strength on the llth December, 1921 Net decrease since the 10th July, 192114,280 164

An All-Ireland Conference of Railwaymen was held in the Trades Hall, \   Dublin, on the 11th instant to consider the situation, and appointed a National I   Emergency Committee to carry into effect the terms of two resolutions, one which I   declared  that in no circumstances would  the Carrigan Arbitration Award be I   accepted by the railwaymen, and the other of which called upon the Irish Govern-I   ment, or Governments, to institute an immediate enquiry into the whole administra-I   tion of the Irish railways, and demanded that, pending the result of this enquiry, there should be no interference with the standardised conditions of employment 1   which existed on the 15th August last, the date on which the Irish railways passed I   from Government control.Present Political Situation in Ireland&apos;.Mr. de Valera&apos;s declared opposition to the terms of the Peace Agreement, which he describes as being &quot; In violent conilict with the wishes of the majority of the IrishI nation as expressed in successive elections during the past three years,&quot; has metI with practically no support from the Irish press, and, so far as can be gathered,I with little support or encouragement from the general public.     The four great1 ^Nationalist dailies, the &quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal,&quot;   the &quot;Irish  independent,&quot;   the1 Cork Examiner,&quot; and the &quot;Irish News&quot; (Belfast), have taken  a strong andj uncompromising line in favour of the immediate ratification of the Treaty, and thei small provincial journals have, with an almost unanimous voice, adopted the samej view.   Of the twenty-eight members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, sixteen have i already publicly expressed their approval of the Peace terms, among the number being Cardinal Logue, the Archbishops of Tuam and Cashel and Dr. Fogarty,i Bishop of Killaloe, the last-named being a man of pronounced Sinn Fein views andI one of the Trustees of Dail Eireann.    An equally encouraging indication of theI strength of the popular support behind Mr. Griffith and his colleagues is the attitudej of the Southern Unionists, whose fears of hostile treatment by a Sinn Fein Govern-I ment have been allayed by the assurances given by Mr. Griffith that a scheme will bej &quot;devised for securing to them their full share of representation in the First ChamberI of the Irish Parliament and that they will be consulted as to the constitution of theI Upper Chamber.   Among the leading Unionists who have pledged their loyalty toj the Irish Free State are the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, the Protestant Bishop
of Qssory and the members of the Board of Trinity College. With one or two exceptions the members of Dail Eireann itself have been singularly reticent as to their intentions, but I find myself unable to believe that a majority will be prepared to vote against the ratification of the Treaty.H.
