This document, is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Gkwernmeht.&apos; O.P. 3519. * -   &apos;      &quot;&apos; &quot;0 a B; I k b        ai  &quot;S EC RET.   . ...SUMMER TIMS. -v.,,ho&quot;      &apos;&quot; Memorandum^ &quot;by the Home Secretary.The Summer Time &amp;ot of 1916 gave power t* make annual Orders in Council as t* Summer Time &quot;during the continuance of the present war&quot;. By the War Emergenoy Laws &quot;Continuance Act.of 1920 this pOwer was extended for a periad of one year after the, termination ef tho present war.   The date of the&apos; termination of th$&quot;war was the 31st August, 1921, and aooOrdingly the existing power will expire on the 31st AUguet, 1922.The question of the continuance of Summer Time was examined by a Departmental Committee, which reportedin Februaryr 1917, after the first experience of summer Time in 1916*   This representative Committee (of which Mr. iJ,wVWilson, M.P. was Chairman) said &quot;Taking the .evidenoe ... we have received as a whole we oan&apos;. unhesitatingly say that the. vast preponderance of opinion throughout Great Britain is. enthusiastically in favour of Summer Time and Its renewal - not only as.a war measure but as a permanent institution&apos;&apos;, ,Though a certain amount of opposition is still manifested mostly by agricultural interests, further experience has only confirmed.the conclusion of the Committee that to the vast majority *Jf the community. ^Summer Time is a much appreciated boon, and its abandonment would be. very unpopular.Some inconvenience te agriculture has no doubt been caused by-the operation of Summer Time.   This has been more particularly felt at harvest time, and has been due in part to the unwillingness of the agricultural labourers to alter their hours of work so as to accord, with the sun time.   But &quot;the&quot; Departments of Agriculture  for England     . and Scotland, with whom the Home Office has been in consultation all., through, have not regarded the&quot;inoonvenienoe as so serious as toim, justify them in reeommending&quot;the discontinuance of Summer.Time,.......The contention whioh has. been.urged by;some, that Summer: Time :;&apos; &quot; -&apos;; is injurious to.the.health of children is being investigated&apos;by the Board of Educations, butthe.Chief :Medioal Officer in&quot; his last&apos; Annual Report stated that &quot;so far there is absence of kny reliable evidehCe&apos; &quot; that the operation of the Aot is detrimental to the health of children .......... On the contrary they reap in an even greater- ,degree than adults the &quot;same substantial advantages as the rest. ,of the population&quot; (see Sir: George Newman^ Report for .192C, page 43j...
.*2wThe beneficial e feet of Summer Time on public health, its advantage as affording additional opportunities for outdoor recreations particularly to our town populations, and its&apos;usefulness as&quot;a minor though appreciable measure of national eoonomy, arc unquestioned, and I have no hesitation in reoommending that legislation should be introduced for making Summer Time a permanent institution,A question arises aa to the dates at which Summer Time should   &apos; begin and end: -   - ;The Committee of 1917.recommended that the ,Summer Time period Bhould be from the second Sunday in April to the third Sunday in September.   This period has in faot been somewhat lengthened in practicej owing to war or other emergency conditions, but the   * earliest date adopted has been the 24th March and the latest the 25th October.   The periods have been as follows1917 8th April - 17th September&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;    &apos; 1918 24th March - 30th September   ,1919 30th Maroh - 29th September1920 ,. -28th March - 25th&apos;October * ,1921.       -3rd April -   3rd October  &quot;-&apos;&apos; it is very desirable, and has been strongly urged, on. me by the. Air Ministry, the Postmaster GenerrJ., and the Railway Companies, that .. Summer Time in this country should coincide with Summer Time in ... France and in Belgium; and a Conference on the subject has been held .... i between representatives of the Home Office, and. other Government       ;-Departments interested and representatives of the French and Belgian Governments,  -In Pranoe, Summer. Time is governed by a permanent law. fixing the period from the 15th March to the 25th October, but in order to . seoure uniformity with the United Kingdom tho Frenoh Government are prepared to sacrifice part of this period, provided that it is not reduced to less than six months arid the whole of themonth of September, is included in the period. &apos;   -As a result of the Conference an agreement was reaphed that....:;,,, the representatives&apos;should recommend to their respective Governments: that the period&quot; should be from the night of. the last Saturday.,.. in-.,,,,..--Maroh (or if that Saturday is the Saturday before Easter. Sunday, . the last Saturday but one in Maroh) to the night of tho first,. vv, . Saturday in Obtober.   If, however, the British Parliament would not consent to the slight extension involved at the end of the period,, it&apos;was agreed to reoommend the;1st Gotober as the terminating date -&apos; though the Belgian representatives were &quot; strongly in,.favour of making the ohange take place On the Saturday night. ;: i &apos;   &apos; ;: ;v -If effeot is to be given to this proposal the Frenoh will have to taMe immediate steps to amend their.existing Act, and they., ask that they may have&apos;a deoiaioia within a fortnight.* extended from 27th September owing to Goal strike
E. S.29th November, 1921.S.P.4. 6-8.Seeing that the Frenoh and Belgian Gweriwienterhav-q. gone a long way to meet the British Government;) i reoommenl that the Cabinet ^-eheuld approve the propoaal to fix the first Saturday in October as the terminating date.   There 1b a great convenience in making the ohangd over take place at the week-ends and the representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture for England and Sootland who were present at the conference Beemed to think that the two or three extra days whioh thiB proposal would involve would matter very little.There is some objeotion by the religious communities 46 beginning Summer Time on Easter Sunday owing to the fact that the services begin very early en Easter morning, and tho introduction of Summer Time Oh     i that data would make a very.short night for these taking part; and I think it ia desirables on the infrequent occasions when Easter fallB within the period 26th March to 1st April, that Summer Time should begin on the previous Sunday.     It should begin before rather than after Easter so that it may be in operation through the Easter holidays.I accordingly ask for a decision of the Government that a Bill shall be brought in next Session, providing that the period of Summer Time shall begin from the night of the last Saturday in Maroh (or whan that Saturday is the Saturday preceding Easter Day&apos; the the last Saturday but one in Maroh) and endifctg on the night of the first Saturday in October.The practice of fixing by Order in Council different datee in different years has caused some inoonvenienoe partdoularly to Railway Companiesj who prepare their timo tables a long while beforehand, and legislation fixing the dates permanently will have many advantages^
