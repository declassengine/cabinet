DRAFT NOTE TO UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.1. In their Note of the 1st December, 1932, HisMajesty&apos;s Government gave a full statement of the reasons^^ which convinced them that the existing system of inter-governmental war debt obligations had broken down.      They pointed out the difference between these war debt obligations and normal credit operations for development purposes:    they showed the economic impossibility of making transfers on the scale required by these obligations and the disastrous effect which any further attempt to do so would have on trade and prices:    they emphasised the sacrifices which the British nation had made in this matter and the injustice of the difference between their funding settlement and those accorded to other deotors. They concluded that a revision of the existing settlements was essential in the interests of world revival and they urged that further payments should be postponed pending such a revision.      Nothing that has since occurred has led His Majesty&apos;s Government to change the views they then expressed.2. That the present settlement imposes upon the people  ^of this country a burden which is both unreasonable in itself and inequitable in relation to the treatment accorded to other countries may be clearly seen from the following figures.In respect of war advances totalling $4,277,000,000, payments totalling $2,025,000,000 have been made up to date by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the United States Government.      Yet, despite these payments, the nominal amount of the debt still outstanding as at the 15th June 1934 amounts to $4,713,785,000.Meanwhile, in respect of war advances totalling$5,572,300,000 made by the United States Government toother European Governments, the aggregate payments made up to date amount to only $678,500,000.      Thus though thewar advances to these other Governments exceed by-1-
one-quarter the advances made to the United Kingdom, the payments by the United Kingdom amount to more than three times what the united States Government has received from those other Powers.On the other hand. His Majesty&apos;s Government are both a Creditor and a Debtor in regard to these inter-governmental obligations.     They themselves made war advances to the Allied Governments totalling $7,800,000,000:    but they have paid over all receipts obtained in respect of these loans, as well as in respect of war reparations, to the United States Government and have paid nearly as much again out of their own resources.Convinced that any resumption of payments on the past scale could not but intensify the world crisis and might provoke financial and economic chaos, His Majesty&apos;s Government have sus-pended their claims on their debtors, in the hope that a general revision of these inter-governmental obligations might be effected in the interests of world recovery. But it would be impossible for them to contemplate a situation in which they would be called upon to honour in full their war obligations to others while continuing to suspend all demands for the payment of the war obligations due to them.3. The improvement which has taken place in the Budgetarysituation of the United Kingdom in no way invalidates this con-clusion.    This improvement is due entirely to the unprecedented sacrifices made by the people of this country.    Since the war they have been carrying a burden of indebtedness amounting to approxi-mately  8,000,000,000 or  170 per head of their population, about one-fifth of which represents the war loans made to the Allied Governments.    To balance their Budget, they have for the past fifteen years been paying taxation on a scale for which it would be hard to find a parallel elsewhere.    During the discussions which took place last October, the British representatives pointed out that in 1929 (the last year for which statistics were available) the total burden of taxation in the United Kingdom in relation to national   wealth   was   approximately   twice   as   heavy as   that    in   the   United   States,      and/
&quot;    22 3this statement was not contested by the representatives. of the United States Treasury- This taxation, amountingto close on one-quarter of the national income, has involved a prolonged period of industrial depression and the maintenance ever since the War of an army of unemployed. Yet in order to restore the national credit in 1931, the people of this country accepted further and heavy increases in taxation, accompanied by rigorous control of expenditure and cuts in salaries and allowances of all kinds:       and despite all these measures the Budget would have again shown a deficit last year had it not been possible to secure, by the conversion operation carried through in 1932, a reduction in the rate of interest paid on a large proportion of the public debt.      This reduction has enabled His Majesty&apos;s Government to remit a part of the emergency sacrifices imposed in 1931 and to restore a part of the cuts on salaries, and the whole of the cut in unemployment allowances, the continuance of which was imposing a severe strain on the national conscience. It would have been a gross act of social injustice to have denied this relief to the people of this country in order to pay war debts to the United States while suspending the war debt payments due to the United Kingdom. 4.      But, although it is desirable that the internal budgetary position of this country should not he mis-understood, it is really irrelevant to the question of inter-governmental debt, the payment of which has to be related to the balance of trade and not to the volume of internal revenue.      The revenues of this country are sterling revenues, whereas the debt payments to America have to be made in dollars or in gold.      In order to secure the means of payment,  therefore, any sums available in sterling would have to he transferred across the exchange.      The attempt to transfer amounts of this magnitude would, as their immediate effect, cause a sharp depreciation of sterling
-    228.against the dollar which, as His Majesty&apos;s Government under-stand, would not be consistent with the monetary policy, of the United States Government.       And in the long run such international transfers would be impossible without a radical alteration in the economic policies of the United States of America. Payment of debts implies the willing-ness of the creditor to  accept goods and services sufficient to cover the debts due to him, over and above the goods and services required to cover his exports:    and to make it possible for the United States to receive payment of their claims, it would be necessary to affect a complete reversal of the existing favourable balance of trade between their country and the rest of the world.      In the ease of the United Kingdom the balance of trade is heavily unfavourable and the balance of accounts is not such that His Majesty&apos;s Government could contemplate the transfer of any substantial sum across the exchange unless it was compensated by equivalent receipts from the foreign debtors of this country. If this were done, sterling would notbe affected by the payments to America but the burden would be thrown on the currencies of the European debtor countries, thereby aggravating the present crisis which it is the object both of the United States and of His Majesty&apos;s Government to alleviate.5.      Thus the question of the British War Debt is only part of the wider quewtion of the inter-governmental obligations resulting from the world War.     As has already been pointed out, the United Kingdom while it was a debtor to the United States of America was itself a creditor for larger amounts from Prance, Italy and other ex-Allied Powers in respect of war debts, and these in turn are co-creditors with the United Kingdom of Germany in respect of reparations.      These inter-governmental debts, as stated in the British Note of 1st December, 1932,    are   radically   different   from   the   Commercial
2^ n ^ iloans raised &quot;by foreign Governments on the markets for productive purposes.      War debts are neither productive nor self-liquidating and the unnatural transfers required for their payment would involve a general collapse of normal international exchange and credit operations.    The Administration of the United States under President Hoover recognised this fact and initiated the moratorium on inter-governmental payments in 1931 in order to avert an immediate collapse.      The moratorium of 1931 caused another change in the situation;    it made any resumption of the pre-existing reparation and War debt settlements impossible, and the revision of reparations embodied in the Lausanne Agreement was made subject to the inclusion of a subsequent Agreement for the revision of War Debts. 6. It was with these facts in mind that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment approached the United States Government in December 1932 and the United States Government in their Note of the 7th December welcomed their suggestion for a close examination between the two countries of the whole subject.      After this exchange of notes His Majesty&apos;s Government paid the instalment due on the 1st December, 1932, in gold, explaining that this payment was not to be regarded as a resumption of the annual payments contemplated by the existing Agreement and that it was made because there had not been time for the discussion with regard to that Agreement to take place and because the United States Government had stated that in their opinion such a payment would greatly increase the prospects of a satisfactory approach to the whole problem.      In accordance with the arrangement then made, discussions took place, first, in the spring, and later in the autumn, of last year between representatives of the two countries and His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the sympathetic manner in which their representatives were listened to;      But on both occasions it was found impossible to arrive at a settlement
acceptable to the tv/o Governments in the race ox&apos; ine fcrfprece-dented state of world economic and financial conditions. Accordingly the discussions were adjourned and on June 15th and December 15th, 1933, His Majesty&apos;s Government made token payments in acknowledgment of its debt, and the President expressed the personal view that he would not regard His Majesty&apos;s Government as in default.7. In their Note of the 6th November last His Majesty&apos;sGovernment expressed their readiness to resume negotiations on .the general question whenever after consultation with the President it might appear that this could usefully be done. Unfortunately recent events have shown that discussions on the whole question with a view to a final settlement cannot at present usefully be renewed.      In these circumstance. His Majesty&apos;s Government would have been quite prepared to make a further payment on the 15th June next in acknowledgment of the Debt and without prejudice to their right again to present the case for its readjustment, on the assumption that they would again have received the President&apos;s declaration that he would not consider them in default.      They understand, however, that in consequence of recent legislation no such declaration would now be possible, and if this be the case, the procedure adopted by common agreement in 1933 is no longer practicable.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in fact faced with a choice between only tv/o alternatives, viz:    to pay in full the sum of ^262,000,000 as set forth in the communication from the United States&apos; Treasury, dated id5th May, or to suspend all interim payments pending the final revision of the settlement which has been delayed by events beyond the control of the two Governments.    Deeply as they regret the circumstances which have forced them to take such a decision. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they could not assume the responsibility of adopting a course which would revive the whole system of inter-Governmental War Debt payments.
As already pointed out the resumption of full payments to the United States of America would necessitate a corresponding demand by His Majesty&apos;s Government from their own V/ar Debtors.    It would recreate the conditions which existed prior to the world crisis and were in large measure responsible for it.      Such a procedure would throw a bombshell into the European arena which would have financial and economic repercussions over all the five continents and would postpone indefinitely the chances of world recovery.9. Accordingly His Majesty&apos;s Government arereluctantly compelled to take the only other course open to them.    But they wish to reiterate that -while suspending further payments until it becomes possible to discuss the ultimate settlement of inter-Governmental War Debts with a reasonable prospect of agreement, they have no intention of repudiating their obligations and will be prepared to enter upon further discussion of the subject at any time when in the opinion of the President  such discussion would be likely to produce results of value.
