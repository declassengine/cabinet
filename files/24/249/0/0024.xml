THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1934.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 136 (34).1CABINET.PROPOSED  RESTRICTION   ON   THE   SALE   OF  AERONAUTICALMATERIAL  TO  GERMANY.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Secretary ofState for Air.UNDER the Cabinet decision of the 28th July, 1933 (Cabinet Conclusions No. 49 (33) of the 28th July, 1933, Conclusion 4), certain Governments were informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready, should those Governments be prepared to take corresponding action, to request British aircraft and engineering manufacturers not to conclude any agreement for the sale of aircraft or engines or of the manufacturing rights therein to the German Government direct, or to any German Ministry or public authority, and particularly the Police, unless they had received a categorical written assurance from the German Government that the material or rights in question \vould not be used for any purpose forbidden by the Paris Air Agreement of 1926.The majority of the Governments approached intimated their agreement with the procedure proposed; but the United States and Italian Governments declined to accept it.On the other hand, a French note of the 27th November suggested an extension of the scope of the procedure originally proposed by us, and an agreement on a closer definition of the characteristics of the engines, &amp;c, the export of which to Germany the Governments concerned would agree to prevent. It is plain that the United States and Italian Governments would not agree to this suggestion either; and the Air Ministry are also opposed to its adoption.The intention of the Italian and United States Governments, as explained to us, is, in fact, to distinguish between the export to Germany of civil and military aeronautical material; this is in effect consistent with their obligation under the Paris Air Agreement, and is the procedure actually followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government (see Cabinet Conclusion 7 (34) of the 28th February, 1934, No. 1, on the question of the sale of certain Armstrong-Siddeley aero engines to Germany).In the circumstances it seems useless to continue the attempt to negotiate any special agreement on the subject; and the only course still open seems to be to inform the Governments previously consulted that, as it has been impossible to secure general approval of the proposals put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government last year, His Majesty&apos;s Government, so far as the export of aircraft and aeronautical material to Germany is concerned, intend simply to continue to do all in their power to ensure that no breaches of the relevant international instruments occur; they feel sure that the other Governments concerned will act similarly.A decision on this matter is urgent; as the French Government are pressing for an official reply to their various communications on the subject, and, in default of its receipt, are misrepresenting the action and attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter.J. S. L.Foreign Office, May 14, 1934.7409   [10026]
