May 1934.Copy No......4...y..CABINET.Proposed Legislation to deal with Communism in India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.With reference to Cabinet decision No. 4 of the 11th April, I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a telegram from the Government of India, dated the 20th April, in which they communicate their decision not to proceed at present with their proposal to introduce an anti-Communist Bill iu the Assembly. It will be observed that this change of policy has been made in the light of the new political situation arising out of the decision of the Swaraj Party to contest elections.I have informed the Government of India that I approve their decision. I have also agreed in regard to the last, sentence of their telegram that there would be no objection in principle to the use of the Governor-General&apos;s special power of certification if it subseqiiently proves necessary to introduce the Bill as an emergency measure and if the Legislature then refuses to pass it.India Office, S. H,1st May 1934.Telegram from Government of India. Home Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated 20th April 1934.Communist legislation. We have decided not to introduce the Bill during the lifetime of the present Assembly uuless an emergency arises.   Our reasons are : (a) The decision of the Swaraj Party to contest elections has changed the positionin India. We feel that those members of the Legislative Assembly who have loyally supported us in all legislative proposals directed to stability of the country would be reluctant to support a Bill of this kind in view of the Swaraj Party programme repealing repressive legislation.(b) If they supported the Bill many might lose their seats and we would be facedwith a stronger Swaraj Party after the election.(c) If, as is not unlikely in these conditions, Bill were rejected or defeated bydetermined obstruction, which would be facilitated by the fact that time programme is short, it would not, be possible for us to recommend certification having regard to the views expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. To drop a Bill of this kind after introduction would be most harmful. It would be a striking triumph for the opposition and a great encouragement to the communists.(d) We cannot urge that the Bill is an imperative necessity, though develop-ments in Bombay might perhaps shortly strengthen the case for action. Administratively, we ought to have powers, but political disadvantages of introducing the Bill now outweigh the advantages.2. We shall suggest to Bombay to make the fullest use of existing law, including the Criminal Law Amendment Act and the special laws now in force in that Province. We intend to keep up persistent propaganda in the country against communism with the object both of checking recruitment and of keeping the subject continually before those whom communism threatens. If, in spite of this, situation deteriorates seriously we may have to ask your agreement to introduction of the Bill as an emergency measure and, in that case, we understand that you would not object to certification.SECRET.CP. 123 (34).275965   5.34
