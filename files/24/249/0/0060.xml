STATE OF TRADE - MAY. 1934.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in May, 1934.W.R.iBoard of Trade,30th June, 1934.
CONFIDENTIAL.A.C.298.BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.-STATE OF TRACE - MAY. 1954.Summary of Reports, submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council. (supplemented in some cases with&quot;&quot; statistical information from other sources.)EMPLOYMENT.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 14th May was 2,090,381, a decrease of 57,814 as compared with 23rd April.     The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by 68,929, but the number temporarily stopped increased by 11,115.The changes between 14th May and 23rd April in the different Divisions of Great Britain were as shown below;-The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 14th May was 10,187,000. This was 47,000 more than at 23rd April9 1934, and 570,000 more than at 22nd May, 1933.The improvement during the month was most marked in the building, public works contracting and certain allied trades, engineering and iron-founding, shipbuilding and shiprepairing, tinplate manufacture, the cotton industry, the clothing trades (except boot and shoe manufacture), the distributive trades, most of the transport services, and hotel and boarding house service.Employment showed a further decline, however, in the coal mining industry, and in the wool textile industry.     Ther was also some decline in the jute industry and in dock and harbour service,South Eastern South Western MidlandsWalesLondonNorth Eastern North Western Scotland- 11,1858,494 6,993 6,154 +    10,151- 16,9459,160 9,034
OVERSEAS TRADE.     Imports in May were  61.7 million, and total exports  37.^5 million, compared with  57.3 m. and  34.6 m. in May, 1933.     Of the increase of  4.4 m. in imports,  2.4 m. were in raw materials, including  1.2 m. for wood and timber,  0.4 m. for rubber  0.36 m. for cotton and  0.35 m. for paper making materials.     There was an increase of  2.3 m. in imports of articles wholly or mainly manufactured, including  0.4 ra. for machinery and  0.3 m. for iron and steel and manufactures thereof.     Exports of imported merchandise amounted to  4.8 m. as against  3.8 m. in May, 1933.     The excess of imports over exports was  24.2 m., against  22.7 m. in May, 1933.     The excess for the first five months of the year is  118.9 m. as compared with  100.2 m. in the corresponding months of 1933.ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIC - For the five weeks ended 3rd june the railway traffic receipts were  518,000 (a,91%) more thanin the s ame period of 1933.     For the 23 weeks ended 3rd june the increase was  3,095,000 (5.47$).     The percentage increases in the various classes of traffic were:-5 weeks 22 weeks ended 3rd June        ended 3rd June. Passenger Traffic...... 5.11 1.35Merchandise, Minerals &amp; Livestock........... 3.45 9.54Coal, Coke &amp; Patent Fuel. 1.92 6.86In March 1934 the number of passengers (other thanBeason ticket holders) conveyed over standard gauge railways(excluding those of the London Passenger Transport Board) was6.3j  more than insMarch 1933, but the comparison is affectedby the occurrence of Good Friday on March 30th this year.For the 4 weeks ended 24th March freight tonnage was11.4??. more than a year ago, minerals and merchandise increasingby 24.6$ and other merchandise by 10.5$;   live stockdecreased by 9.4$.
In the calendar month of March the following percentage increases over the tonnage conveyed in March 1933 were recorded:-There was however a decrease of 24.5$ in the amount of road making materials conveyed,.MOTORS - The number of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, newly registered in April was 25,691, which was 3,451 or 15.5!* more than a year ago.     Registrations of private cars increased by 2,071(11.9%) and of goods vehicles by 1,466 (38.2 );   but those of hackney vehicles decreased.     Registrations of motor cycles increased by 43 or 0. Q%.FINANCE AND BANKING - (l) London.     During the month of May there was &quot;a noticeable steadiness of rates in general. Money was generally fairly easy until towards the end of the month, and the average tender rate for Treasury Bills was very consistent, varying between 17s.2d. and 17s.3^d., except for a break to 16s.7d. in the third week of the month.     Quiet conditions were experienced on the Stoek Sxchange.     Capital issues during May amounted to  22.4 m. which is the highest monthly total for over three years, and compares with  14.6 m. in May 1933.     The Dominion of Canada issued its second loan in London since the war in the form of a 3   Stock for a total of  10 m. , and an interesting industrial issue was the offer of 4,500,000  1 ordinary shores of United Steel Companies at 21s.6d.     Both were over-subscribed.     Arrangements were also made for a conversion loan by the Argentine Government in the form of  2,3 m. 4   Sterling Bonds.In the foreign exchange market the principal exchanges appreciated against sterling in the latter part of the month. The dollar also appreciated against the franc, but not to the same extent.     The movement is variously ascribed to the large increase in America&apos;s export surplus, to the repatriation of foreign investments by American banks, and to theIron and Steel..............Iron Ore....................Pig iron....................Limestone for blast furnaces Bricks, blocks and tiles....

covering of bear positions contracted earlier in the year.(2) France.     Though the market in rentes did not maintain the high level reached during April, it is still firm, and the Government is believed to be contemplating an issue of F.10 to F.12 milliards for debt consolidation purposes.     With the return of gold to the Bank of France, the bank rate was lowered on the 31st May from 3;  to 2- $.     Both production and employment show a further improvement, but there is considerable criticism of the high cost of production which is attributed principally to heavy and unevenly distributed taxation.     To lighten this burden the Government have put forward a proposal for the reduction of income tax and of the tax on profits, the abolition of vserious petty taxes, and the simplification of other fiscal burdens.     It is apparently assumed that these reliefs will cause turnover to increase sufficiently to maintain the aggregate yield, and new taxation is not proposed.(3) Germany.     An agreement was reached at the end of May between the Reichsbank and the British, French and Swedish medium and long term creditors.     The arrangement covered the interest payable between 1st July, 1934, and 30th June, 1935, on   non-Reich external   Indebtedness, the Dawes and Young loans thus remaining unaffected.     The Dutch and Swiss creditors refused a similar agreement, while the Americans remained uncommitted.     The agreement Involved a further considerable restriction of transfers from Germany.     It has since broken down on the decision of the Reichsbank to suspend, for six months as from 1st July, all cash transfers on German medium and long term debts abroad, including the Dawes and Young loans.Internal trade and industry continue to show progress, largely owing to public works expenditure, but there is some concern that further recovery may be jeopardised by cuts in imports to protect the slender gold and foreign exchange resources of the Reichsbank.     The reserve has fallen to 3.7$ of the note issue.     The financial results of the State Railways
445  Ifor 1933 showed an operating loss of RM.136 m. against one of RM.67 m. in 1932, in spite of an increase in the receipts from goods traffic.     The volume of business on the Stock Exchange remained at a low level and prices altered but slightly(4) U.S.A.     Stock markets have been dull through a number of causes, including the drought and labour troubles.     There is also some fear of less favourable company results for, though the recession in business activity indices is no more than seasonal, there is a considerable rise in costs.     In the case of the cotton industry, for instance, it was recently stated that raw cotton costs, including the processing tax, had increased by 150$, and labour costs due to the Code and other influences by 70%,     Strikes and the menace of further strikes are a most serious factor in the industrial situation.     A threatened strike in the cotton industry and a general strike at Toledo have been avoided, but the Association of Iron, Steel and Tj.n Workers are threatening to call out their members and various other industries are involved.It is not yet possible to estimate the damage caused by the drought, but in the general opinion the serious crop failure and the heavy loss of life amongst cattle will act as a check to recovery;    though it may perhaps be argued that If the failure of the wheat orop led to a heavy fall on the carry-over, and to a substantial and permanent rise in the world price of wheat, tha distress need only be temporary.     The Federal Government is already setting aside 0 500 m. for drought relief.COAL.     For the 13 weeks ended May 19th, the output of coal shows an increase of 10^1 over the corresponding period of 1933.     The number employed was approximately the same (787,000).     Exports in May were 3,648,000 tons, being much the same as a year ago;    exports to the Scandinavian count rues, Germany, Spain and Argentina showed an increase, but there was a decline in the case of France, Belgium and Italy. Exports to the Irish Free State also showed a decline; imports into that country from Poland showed an increase in
March of over 70$ as compared with a year ago.     Increases in output over April, 1933, were recorded &quot;by Germany (2Z%), France (4 ), the Saar region (9%), Poland (2C?S) and Belgium (7$). Except in Belgium, stocks have &quot;been decreasing.IRON AND .3TESL.   During May there was a net increase of 3 furnaces in &quot;blast.     The total output of pig iron was 527,900 tons against 339,900 tons in May last year, and the daily rate of production was some 3% higher than in April. The output of steel ingots and castings totalled 780,000 tons, against 599,600 tons in May, 1933.     There was a slight seasonal decline in new &quot;business on home account, &quot;but the tonnage of orders in hand is substantial and stocks of pig iron have &quot;been reduced.     An expansion of forward buying is expected before long.     Export business is still depressed but there hare been signs of expansion recently.     The production of semi-finished material is on .a good scale, but Continental manufacturers continue to obtain an appreciable volume of business Finished steel products continue in active demand;    the improvement in orders for shipbuilding material is being maintained and orders from the engineering trades in general are good, but export business is unsatisfactory.On the North East Coast conditions show little change from last month.     There is a seasonal     decline in new business but makers are well situated as regards orders and heavier specifications for joists and sections are expected.     The sheet trade is feeling seriously the absence of export orders.In Scotland   the pig iron market is quiet but makers are receiving fairly good orders for sections, plates and rails. Overseas business remains poor with little prospect of improvement.In the Shgff j eld dj st-ri c* the output of steel has reached a record rate of some l  million tons per annum.     Basic and acid billets and stainless steel sheets and steel strip are in good demand and there has been some expansion in the market for wire rods.     Export trade is still, however, abnormally
depressed, despite a recent improvement in certain markets.In South Vales business is firm, orders in hand being sufficient to counterbalance the smaller volume of new business.     The improved output of sheet and tinplate bars is being maintained.      Sales of tlnplates are reported to have exceeded production but business in galvanised sheets is still disappointing.MACHINE TOOLS -   Home trade continued active, but the difficulty of transferring skilled labour from the North to the Midlands still remains.     iixports in kay amounted to  117,839 which is below the April level but is higher than in March.     There was s ome improvement in the French market which has been bad owing to quota and other restrictions, exports being 38,305 as against  4,878 in April.     On the other hand, exports to Russia, which had increased to  40,709 in April, fell to  27,196 in May.     Tho recent reduction in the premiums for Insurance of Russian bills is greatly appreciated by the trade.Imports of machine tools in May amounted to  146,946, which iB a considerable increase over March and April.COTTON - During the first half of May activity was rather higher than in April.     In the spinning mills which make regular returns to the Federation, production continued to increase during the early part of May.     For the spinning and weaving sections as a whole the percentage of unemployment was 30.2 in the first two weeks of the month, as against 20.6 in April.      During the latter half of the month, however, activity was abnormally low, owing to extended stoppages in a number of mills over the V-whitsun holidays.There was e fall in raw cotton prices early in the month, but there has since been a fairly steady recovery which is likely to continue.     The improvement in orders noticeable in April was still effective during May.
Spinners generally were able to maintain their margins except in the coarse American Section where the price agreement was definitely suspended, and prices for this class of yarn have dropped sharply.     This breakdown has caused anxiety, but so far there are no signs of other agreements being affected. The Bill to give statutory effect to wages agreements in the weaving section has led employers and operatives to re-examine the present agreements.Keen interest was aroused by the Government1s invitation to the Colonies to impose quotas on the import of Japanese cotton and rayon goods.     The volume of trade affected is not large in comparison with Lancashire&apos;s total exports.     In India there was some revival of interest in Lancashire cloths, possibly in consequence of clearances of stocks following the Bombay strike.     Japanese exports of cloth to India in 1933 were somewhat under her quota based on her takings of Indian raw cotton.     If Japan&apos;s takings of Indian cotton are higher than in 1933, an increase in her exports to India may be expected and is, in fact, noticeable in the Indian figures for March.Trade with other Far Eastern countries in Kay was poor. The demand from South America and the Continent was, however, maintained, and some firms reported oncouraging business in vVest and South Africa.WOOL - There was a further decline in the general activity of the industry during May affecting all Departments in the woollen and vrorsted sections.     Unemployment in May was 15.8  as against 14.1^: in the preceding month, and 15.0?* a year ago.     Exports of yarn and tissues in May showed slight increases compared with the previous month but, on the other hand, there was a decrease in the export of tops.     Raw wool prices showed a further deoline during May, and this fall in price is refleoted in the prices of tops and yarn&amp;i.
Present indications do not point to any expectation of a material improvement in the industry in the near future.MOTOR INDUSTRY.     Trade in the home market is satisfactory, and sales are still strong.     Some concern is, however,*&quot;felt at the increase in imports.      In the export market, the industry is disturbed &quot;by a provision in the South African Budget for a reduction of duty on chassis imported for &quot;bodies to &quot;be &quot;built ih the Union, and on &quot;body materials and fittings.      This reduction will &quot;benefit the assembly works established by two American Corporations in South Africa.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES - The demand for metal windows continued to increase.      Business in cutleryt though still active, was quieter although sales of better quality knives were maintained.     Silver and silver-plated ware, particularly the better qualities, was in better demand than in the corresponding periods of the past five or six years.     The scissors and the razor blade sections were ective, but prices were very low in the latter.     A new scale of wages fixed by the Cutlery Trade Board came into operation on 4th June and prices have consequently risen.      In the small tools trade business continued to be very active and all branches are well supplied with orders;   prices are tending to harden.     The needle and the fishing tackle industries were fully employed. Sales in the former could be increased but for the shortage of skilled male labour.Tr-de in enamelled hollow-ware was still brisk, but the increase in imported ware has caused price-cutting.     In the foundry industry the improved demand from engineering trades continued, but as the personnel was dispersed during the depression some time must elapse before full production is restored.      The Metallic Bedstead   Manufacturers&apos; Association haB already in its first eight weeks had good effect, output being maintained at improved prices.     Prices are low in the lock and allied trades   but will probably rise with the increased cost of materials.     The domand for architectural
from the motor trade, No^-ferrous metals show little change. I Rolled metal and tubes ere in demand and most mills are working I full time;    orders from the motor trade are good, require- jments of tubes for shipbuilding are increasing, and promising     iIinquiries have been received from the Admiralty, and from railway companies.     Copper remains steady;   tin haB been somewhat erratic in price, but a fair demand is maintained.CHEMICALS.   Deliveries of alkalies and heavy chemicals in the home market were better during May than in previous Imonths, but fell short of those in May, 1933, which were exceptionally high.     Exports were smaller, but good neverthelesi Domestic deliveries of chloride products increased and exports   i were maintained.     Deliveries of acids and business in wood distillation products were satisfactory.     The market for coal tar products, including pitch, improved in Kay, except for heavy solvent naptha, toluole and xylole.     The general, though slight improvement in pharmaceutical products was maintained.     Sales   &apos; of dyestuffs were slightly lower than in May. 1933, but, with the exception of alizarines and indigo, the cumulative sales for 1934 show a satisfactory increase over the same months of 1933.SOAP. OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES - The soap trade was slightly less active in May.     The demand for margarine was also dull, the volume of the turnover thi3 year up to the end of May shoeing a reduction of 12% on the figures for a year ago. Business in edible oils and fats ;Tas &quot;barely up to the average and continued to be affected by heavy imports of American pure lard at low prices.     Raw materiel production showed a normal seasonal decline, but was up to the level of May, 1933.ELECTRICITY.      During May, 1,125 million units of electricity were produced, against 1,006 million units a year ago;    the increase this year over the first 5 months of 1933,    1 is 17.3J6.     Orders received for heavy plant in the home market   I were lower than in May, 1933, but- export orders were considerablmetalwork is &quot;below normal and prices are uaremunerative. Press work   remains much the same, there being a good demand
higher;    the total-showing^-an&quot; increase over a year ago.     As regards lighter apparatus, there was a slight seasonal slackening in the home demand during April, &quot;but exports amounted to  568,544 against  458,598 a year ago.     Imports totalled  232,867 as compared with  142,912 in April, 1933.RETAIL TRADE.    The value of retail sales in April was 3.2  less than in April, 1933, the first decrease recorded for over six months.     Sections to show an increase were furniture and be&amp;ding (* 9,6 ), miscellaneous goods C+ 6.8$) and furnishing (-r-5.0/v).     The principal deoreases were in &quot;boots and shoes ( - 14.95 ), women&apos;s wear ( - 10.9$), sports and travel goods ( - 8.0;&apos;;) and sweets and tobacco (- 13.8 ). Stocks in April rose by 5.6,-. in food departments and 2.9$ in non-food departments.      The decline in sales was experienced in all areas;    in foodstuffs the biggest decline was recorded in London (West End), Scotland and the North faring the least badly;    the greatest declines in non-food departments were showif in Suburban London (9.9 ), &quot;the south of England (6.6yi) and Scotland (5,0*;)     Stocks showed an increase of 3*0&amp;Preliminary figures for May suggest that the recession in April is at an end and that recovery has recommenced.The international comparison of sales in department stores reveals an increase for April of 5.0$ in the U-S.A, and a decrease of 5.8$ in Great Britain as compared with April, 1933. The United States figure is small in comparison with previous months because April, 1933 was the first month to show recovery under the new Administration.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.    The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks ending 12th May were 6.8$ more than in the corresponding period of last year.     The weighted wholesale prices of seven principal commodities showed a decrease of 2c42? compared with 12 months ago.     The retail prices of Societies are estimated to have increased by 0.62f..
SHIPPING.     There is no material change in the shipping position.     The index number of shipping freights (1913 = 100) for May was 76.45 as compared with 75.60 In April, and 74.49 in May, 1933.^he tonnage laid up ot ports of Great Britain and Ireland on the 1st April, 1934, was 1,079,021 net tons. This is a decrease of 160,000 net tons since the 1st January last, hut the reduction is due to scrapping and sales to foreigners rather than to improved trade.EMPIRE.CANADIAN TRADE - Conditions generally were favourable in April.     The index of the physical volume of business declined slightly in April to 92.6 as against 93.1 in March but is otherwise still higher than in any month since July 1931.      Copper exports amounted to 27,000,000 lbs.  compared with 10,900,000 lbs. in April 1933.     Lead production in March was lower than in January and February, and shipments ( gold and silver declined.     Of food manufactures, the output of flour and rolled oats production showed a decrease, and exports of cheese and canned salmon also showed a decline. The slaughtering and meat packing trades showed practically no change.     Sugar production was 43,300,000 lbs. compared with 21,400,000 lbs.  in the previous four-week period.      The output of newsprint showed little change from March, but the general wood and paper index declined from the March level.The production of steel ingots showed little change, but the April output of pig iron was 27,355 tons against 12,101 in March.     The seasonally adjusted index of motor-car manufacture showed an increase of 15.3$ over March, and the railway freight movement a gain of 25.5^ over the first--four month of 1933,      Imports of merchandise were $34.8 million as against 020.5 million in April of last year-     Exports, after seasonal adjustment;, showed a moderate dealine.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     From lat July to tho end of April 2,568,-062 bales of v/ool were received into store, an increase of 84,777 bcles since March 31st.     Of these 2,407,091 bales, have been sold or exported.     Seasonal shipments of whoat and of flour now stand at 30,954,200 bushels, and 291,421 tons respectively; and seasonal butter exports amount to 99,923 tons as against 97,681 tons for the same period last year.     Total imports during April were  6,193,000 (Australian currency) or  954,000 more than in April, 1933. INDIAN TRAPS.Imports of merchandise in April amounted to 1,095 lakhs of rupees and in May to 998 lakhs, as compared with 969 and 975 lakhs respectively in 1933.     Exports in April and May amounted to 1,235 and 1,323 lakhs respectively as compared with 1,042 and 1,085 lakhs in April and May of 1933.     The wholesale price index number (1914 a 100) for May was 90, against 89 in April. The following All-India crop forecasts hove been issued (l) wheat (fourth forecast) 35,720,000 acres and 9,382,000 tons against 32,724,000 acres and 9,318,000 tons last year;    (2) linseed (final forecast) 3,257,000 acres and 377,000 tons against 3,299,000 acres and 406,000 tons lost year.     The forecast for this year includes the State of Bhopal for the first time; (3) rape and mustard seed   (final forecast) 6,033,uOO acres and 952,000 tons against   6,094,000 acres and 1,046,000 tons last year.
