Report by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Cabinet at its meeting on June 27th, after recordingits acceptance in principle of the two propositions(i) That the    defence of Belgian territory a gainstforeign aggression is a vital British interest which we must, in case of need, actively sustain, and &apos;(ii) That this fact should be placed on record at an early and suitable opportunity,went on to direct &quot;That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take up with the Ministers at the Head of theDefence Departments the e ssential matters v/hich must bedecided satisfactorily before our proposed Declaration inrespect of Belgian inuependence, and explore generally its ^strategic implications&quot;.2. A meeting was held at the Foreign Office on Friday, june 29th,  to which I invited the Defence Departments to send representatives;, and the following were present:-Admiral Sir A.Ernle M.Chatfield, The Rt. Hon. Anthony Eden5C-oCoBo, K.C.M.G.,  C.V.O., M. C. ,M. P. , Lord Privy Seal. First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff.Air Chief Marshal Sir Edward Mr* 0,G*  Sargent,  C.M.G., Ellington, K.O.B., C.M.G. ,C.B.E. ,       A^SlB^nt Hnaer Se^taryChief of the Air Staff. of State, Foreign Office.Major General J.GaDill, C.B., Mr. R.F. Wigram, C.M.G.,C.M.G., D.S.O., Director of Counsellor, ForeignMilitary Operations and Office.Intelligence.and colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, G. C. B. , G. CM. G., G. C. V. 0. The matters referred to us were discussed in considerable detail, and the following paragraphs represent conclusions and
-a-suggestions which should &quot;be reported to the Cabinet.3. There are two matters involved in the enquiry which we   were asked to undertake:- first,  &quot;the essential matters which must &quot;be decided satisfactorily before our proposed Declaration could be made&quot;, and secondly, a general exploration of the strategical implications of such a Declaration.    The second of these matters necessarily requires a report from the Chiefs of Staff, and with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval this was at once put in hand.    1t would be only prudent to know the conclusions reached by the Chiefs of Staff before any Declaration is made and we understand that an early report for this purpose may be expected.    The first question, viz.  that of the &quot;essential matters&apos;&apos;1, was suitable for treatment by the meeting I had called, and the following is the result.4, We emphasise that what is contemplated is a unilateral Declaration made by this country and not a treaty or bar-gain made between this country and Belgium.    Consequently, the case is not one in which we should negotiate with Belgium and settle a number of questions before the Declaration is maaec    It is rather one in which we should indicate to Belgium before or at the time that the Declaration is made what are the matters on which we should naturally require explanation, Information or assurances,  since we could not be expected to maintain and aot upon our Declaration unless Belgium continued to prepare to play her part.    What is wanted therefore is a list of the essential matters to be mentioned to Belgium before or at the time of the Declaration with the intention of securing the detailed information in due course afterwards. . This is, of course, all subject to the view which is taken
of the strategic implications of the Declaration, for we must he clear ahout these hefore we make the Declaration at all.5o So far as Belgium is concerned the essentialmatters as to which v/e should need to stipulate that Belgium must in due course after the Declaration give us adequate satisfaction are the following:-(a,),   Information to show that&apos; Belgium has made and will continue to make adequate provision for the defence of her own territory alike by land, sea and air.(b) Information as to any Franco-Belgian arrangementsaffecting the defence of Belgium and any other arrangements bearing on the matter.(c) Particulars,  if required, of Belgian plans and preparations and facilities for making our own plans and arrangements in conjunction with Belgium if this is thought necessary.The. above stipulations, though expressed in general terms, would cover,  so far as necessary,  a number of concrete matters, e..g. , v/e should be able to demand to be satisfied that the Belgian ports would be adequately defended against naval and air attack, we should ask for information as to Belgian arrange ments for anti-aircraft defence, etc.6. The next essential matter arises from theinsufficiency of the facilities at Belgian ports for the rapid landing and adequate maintenance of a British expeditionary force,, Antwerp-   would   not   be   availablewere   Holland   neutral,      and    the    only   Belgian
ports would be Ostend and Zeebrugge.     Past experience has shown, and military discussion has assumed,  that the French northern ports would also be available.      One important reason why Belgian ports alone would not suffice is that they are particularly exposed to the bombing menace.     Consequently, it would not appear prudent or practicable to make the Declaration without making sure that French ports would be available in case of need to facilitate British help to Belgium.      This involves some form of communication to France. V.      There is the further point that a Declaration specifically addressed to the case of the invasion of Belgium might conceivably fall to be implemented by Anglo-Belgian effort while France was hesitating or holding aloof.      It is pointed out that recent conceptions of French strategy seem to give support to the idea that France might rely on her fortress defences and prepare to meet any attack coming through the Belgian gap on French rather than on Belgian soil. But it is further pointed out that the reason for this is that at present French military opinion is extremely doubtful whether,  if France were to make her plans for the holding of a more advanced line, Belgium could hold up the attack long enough for French forces to join her.     Consequently,  if our Declaration were made it is calculated that the effect would probably be to encourage a change in the French attitude and make the plan of joint resistance of an invasion of Belgian territory one in which the French would co-operate.      All this is closely connected with the strategic problem which is being-considered by the Chiefs of Staff.     For the purposes of the present report it is enough to say that it would seem that the
best course is at the appropriate moment in advance of the Declaration to put to France the specific question whether such a Declaration would be welcome to France.8. The question now arises whether one of the essentialmatters about which we must.be satisfied before the proposed Declaration is made is that if we make it we shall not be left to give Belgium support by ourselves while Prance remains inactive.     No doubt it is true that it is in the interests of prance that Belgium should not be invaded.      But if Prance calculates that in spite of our Declaration the weakness of Belgium ana the delay or inadequacy of our own help are such as to make a German invasion of Belgium inevitable Prance may be disposed to stay in her own territory. Other reasons for this may arise hereafter,, e.g. the internal situation of Prance or some new orientation of.French policy. On the other hand., the Declaration which we are contemplating is nothing more than a method of fulfilling Locarno, and the French have already made a special arrangement with Belgium in the same connection.      Must we not therefore regard as one of the essential matters to clear up what would be the attitude of France in the event of the Declaration coming to be implemented?9. Another   essential   matter    is    to    be reasonably satisfied that we shall be able in case of need to fulfil the proposed Declaration.      This, of course, depends upon the adequacy of our own forces for the purpose.(intld.) J.S.OREIGN OFFICE,29th June, 1934.

BELGIUM:    SUGGESTED DECLARATION REGARDINGBS^IAN.... INDEPENDENCE. -The Meeting was called, in accordance with the decision recorded in conclusion (b) of Cabinet 26 (34) Item 4:&quot;that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take up withthe Ministers at the head of theDefence Departments the essentialmatters which must be decidedsatisfactorily before our proposed declaration in respect of Belgian in-- dependence, and explore generally itsstrategic implications.    The resultshould be reported to the Cabinet&quot;.SIR JOHN SIMON said that it was important to keep in mind that a unilateral declaration was proposed, which did not involve a contract with Belgium, which did not invalidate any existing agreements, but was a public statement of our attitude, our interests and, consequent-ly, our intentions.      The question was half political and half technical.    When a decision had been reached as to the matters which must be settled satisfactorily, the question arose as to whether they were to be defined in detail before making any public declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or whether the declaration should be made bluntly and, at the same time, a private communica-tion sent to the Belgian Government that there were certain matters which must be settled.    The first method would be to get matters defined to our satisfaction, and then to
say we were prepared to make a declaration.    The other method was to make a public declaration and  then privately to inform the Belgian Government what were the essential matters we required to be settled.    Personally he preferred the second method to  the first, because it corresponded more closely with what had happened before.    If we were to make a lot of fuss in regard to essential matters on which we required satisfaction before we made any declaration,  then we might be getting rather close to the idea of an alliance.    It was essential   it    should   be understood that the declaration was based on     British interests, and that Belgium should then be told that it was up to her to satisfy us on the various points concerned. It was necessary now to consider what these points were.THE MEETING then proceeded to discuss the points concerned with the Chiefs of staff.    It was -pointed out that the chief value to Belgium of this declaration would presumably be what lay behind it,  and the point was raised as to whether Belgium would ask us what means we had at our disposal to implement the declaration - in other words, could Belgium rely on the support of the British Empire if she were ^t.tasked?   in answer to this point it was suggested that the form of the declaration proposed in D.C.(M)(o2) 119, paragraph 17, made it quite plain what our intention was.The next question of importance was that of Franca. The Chiefs of Staff desired to know whether we would be committed to come in in support of Belgium with our full strength, with the risk that France might stand aside. In other words, might we be committed to a war single-handed with Germany in alliance only with Belgium?
SIR JOHN SIMON explained the relation of the proposed declaration to Locarno, and how in reality the declaration would extend and under-lineour commitments under this Treaty, which,  in certain circumstances, were not precisely laid down at present.From the Naval side it was explained  that the questions involved in this declaration were the safe transport of the Army to Belgian ports - i.e. Ostende and Zebrugge,  the protection of the lilies of communication if any Expeditionary Force landed in Belgium for an indefinite period,  and  the maintenance of the force in Belgium.    There were difficulties, because Ostende and Zebrugge were not large,  and if,   as was probable,  operations expanded into a great war, it would not be possible to maintain large forces using the Belgian ports alone,  particularly since Antwerp could not be used.    There was also the question as to how far these ports were safe from the point of view of air attack. It would be necessary to examine this point,  and to see particularly whether it might not be essential to use French ports.From the Air point of view it was pointed out  that it would be impossible to say what contribution would be required from us until it was known what air defences the Belgians proposed to put up.    It was true that  the Belgian ports were exposed to air attack, but the same applied to the French ports of Calais and Boulogne.    It was hardly possible to set out what our own commitments would be until we knew what Belgium would do,   and it seemed difficult to obtain this information without consultations with the Belgians.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the point regarding the use of French ports was of great importance.    It might be found that it was impossible to fulfil any obligations under our declara-tion if France stood out.    As a matter of fact,  it had never been contemplated that we should,  alone with Belgium, have to-3-
fight Germany:    it was always assumed that Prance would he on our side.Prom the Army point of view it was emphatically emphasised that we could not undertake a war with Germany with only Belgium as our ally.The discussion then turned on the possibility of our being involved single-handed in a war with Germany.      it was pointed out that the Foreign Office had suggested, in certain circumstances, that this wss a contingency v/hich could not altogether be left out of account, particularly if Germany pursued a policy of aggression in the East and then came back to settle with France or for some other reason France was persuaded to stand out.    it was then suggested that we ought to inform Belgium definitely    that in making this declaration we relied on France being allied with us, and that we were not prepared to give a single-handed guarantee.SIR JOHN SIMON fully appreciated the position, but remarked that if the sequence of events which had been suggested in certain Foreign office papers came to pass we might, in a series of very unfortunate circumstances, have to face the prospect of fighting Germany alone with Belgium.From the. naval point of view it was also pointed out that the German occupation of the Low Countries might have very far-reaching effects, because it might mean that Germany would be established as a Naval power very close to us.    There would also be the danger of air attack.     The Chiefs of Staff had been investigating this latter problem.      The two problems were really different standpoints - one being old and the other new.In regard to the possibility that Germany might attack Belgium without dragging in France, it was pointed out
that a case could arises if we considered that Germany had flagrantly violated Belgian neutrality, and France took another view or preferred to let the League of Nations machinery deal with the position.      Under our declaration we would he &quot;bound to take action at once, whereas France could either avoid action or might involve herself -in   cumbrous machinery which might take a long time to operate.      it was also suggested that if the Treaty of Locarno disappeared at any time it was assumed our declaration would still stand. There was some doubt, however, felt in regard to the French attitude.     Although the contingency of France not coming in was considered to be remote, it was not safe entirely to rule this possibility out of court.      The question of going to France and asking her how she would regard this declaration to Belgium was also discussed.      it was pointed out thatthere might be a risk that France would demand a guarantee of her frontiers as well, although on the whole the view was expressed that France might be reasonable in this matter.As regards the risk to this country from such a declaration, it was pointed out that in some v/ay-s we might be more exposed, but that if Belgium did her proper share in the defences, then, from an air point of view, our security wrould certainly be increased.SIR JOHN SIMON, summarising the difficulties brought out by the Chiefs of Staff, thought the position was that whatever we said in a declaration vis a vis   Belgium, the fulfilment of our obligations in case of need might, in some circumstances, be very hazardous and might actually be impossible unless France was allied with us.      He thought this was a proposition which the Committee could accept.     Two answers suggested themselves to him, though he was not sure that either of them
was right.     The first, which appealed to the lay mind,was in effect that prance would he hound to come in.      it was, however, possible to&apos; conceivo that Prance might find some reason for staying out, and it might be unwise definitely to assume &apos;that because she had signed Locarno she would inevitably come to our support in the conditions under consideration.      The second answer was that in making such a declaration it would be made definitely on the understanding that France would come in.      Either we could tell the Belgians just what we meant in our declaration, or we could address ourselves to the French and tell them we understood that they would come in.      The difficulty in regard to this procedure might be that France would say that up to the present under Locarno a front had been drawn up occupied collectively by Great Britain, France end Belgium, and that we were now proposing to alter this front.      if this was our intention, why should we not do it properly and extend It so as to cover the case of aggression against France? Our real answer would be because what we had in mind v/as our national interest in the integrity of every corner of Belgium which was infinitely greater than our interest in the integrity of every corner of France. For examplerlf Germany v/as to seize a corner of Alsace-Lorraine.it womld be a matter of comparative indifference to us.     Furthermore we had to consider and carry our own people because we were a democratic nation.     \ye might be able to carry them in the case of Belgium, but we should never   be able to do it in the case of France.It was suggested, however, that France would recognise our position, and would welcome our guarantee of Belgium without necessarily pressing any e xtension to herself.
- 467prom the strategic point of view it was urged that we must investigate whether we were capable of carrying out&apos; any undertakings under this declaration before such a declaration was made, and that it was very difficult to do this until we knew what the Belgian contribution would be. For instance, it would be necessary,  from the point of view of the Navy, for Belgium to put her seaward defences in order against submarine attack.      Prom the air point of view it would be necessary to have an aircraft zone in Belgium which must, be protected.      These problems had not been considered at all.SIR JOHN SIMON remarked that what haunted him was the observation that had so often been made in respect of Lord Grey and the Government of his time, to the effect that if Germany had known we would intervene, war would never have taken place. In order to prevent any criticism of this kind being levelled again, it would be possible to tell Germany of cur intentions, and leave it at that.      It might not be necessary to get up publicly and declare our intentions.    As to whether action of this kind would satisfy Belgium, was, of course, another matter.Various objections were raised to this idea, both from the point of view of international and domestic politics.      It was thought it would be extremely difficult to keep any such statement to Germany from becoming public at some time or ano ther.
There was some discussion as to the wording of the Declaration,  in view of the difficulty that we might be left single handed to fight Germany with Belgium.      It was pointed . out, however, that the Belgian Government held strongly the view that once Germany knew that Great Britain we&quot;re coming rc, they would respect their neutrality.       It would not be safe merely to assert that it was a vital British interact that Germany should not attack Belgium, but we must also affirm that we would take active  steps immediately to prevent any such aggression.      Unless we did this, there would not be sufficient deterrent to Germany.SIR JOHN SIMON suggested that the meeting must proceed on the basis that the Cabinet had accepted their recommendations (a) and (b)  in principle, and that it was now for the Chiefs of Staff to formulate the practical considerations.    In explanation of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions,  he said that what was, he thought,  in their minds was that if there was an unprovoked atoaek on Belgium,  we  mould declare ourselves determined tc use all our forces in support of Belgium. The first observation on that was, he understood,  that it would be necessary to examine .the strategic problems involved before a decision v/as reached as to whether the Declaration was desirable or possible.     He understood  from the Chief   of the Air Staff that he contemplated talks with Belgium before any Declaration was made.      He was doubtful if it was possible to do this.      His idea was that we should make a declaration and at the same time say privately to Belgium there were several things on which we required to be satisfied.      First of all,  we should wish to know what was the nature of any Franco-Belgian military agreement and secondly,    that we should only be able to implement the declaration if Belgium herself was ready tc play her proper part and, therefore^ . it would be necessary for us to know what they would do.       It was not proposed tc
have a close military compact with Belgium, but if we made a declaration,  it would be necessary for Belgium to play her part, and not to be content just to let us bear the whole burden.       He was very much afraid that if we had consultations leading to agreement on the lines which had been suggested, such conversations would   be of a constantly recurring nature and from a political and Parliamentary point of view they might3    in   the   end;, involve   rather   formidableproposals.In answer to various questions,  he said he did not regard the proposal as an Anglo-Belgian alliance.      The proceeding was to be undertaken in our own interests, and because our position would be prejudiced if Germany laid hands on Belgium, we proposed,  therefore, publicly to tell Germany that if this happened we should be there.        The whole object was primarily to keep Germany away, but we must at the same time say to Belgium that, although the declaration was made in our own interests,  it was equally to their benefit, and we must be satisfied that they were prepared to look after themselves.      If Belgium did not seem to be playing her part properly,  we should have to take up the question with her after thedeclaration was made,  and put pressure on her to see that she did. her part.It was suggested that perhaps the necessary ends    could be met by linking the declaration with Locarno, and keeping it under the shield of that Treaty.      We could say that Belgium was vital to our security, and if Belgium were attacked,  we were bound in our own interests to go to her rescue.    But that need not be dissociated from Locarno, in fact,  it would be a great advantage if it  could be clearly linked, thereto.      It was represented that perhaps  the same end oould be obtained merely by a declaration to Germany.    If
we made no public declaration to Belgium and Germany were to invade that country. Prance would be bound to come to her assistance.      If,  on the other hand, we had made a public declaration to Belgium,  it might happen that Prance would throw the consequences upon us and only assist when it suited her purposes.     If we were to warn Germany in advance, without giving any public guarantee   to Belgium, that difficulty might be avoided.It was represented that one possible advantage of the proposed declaration v/ould be that it would increase the likelihood of French co-operation in the defence of Belgian territory.      At the present time, her defensive plans were largely based on the defence of her own soil, perhaps because she thought that the Belgian defences were weak. If we were to declare our intention to support Belgium,  it might be that France would be more forthcoming.     At the moment,  it was thought that whilst France did not intend to desert Belgium, yet she was anxious to avoid too early a forward movement,  and it might be that Belgium was overrun before France could move to her rescue.The following points were suggested by the Chiefs ofStaff as pre requisites before a public announcement was na.de of our intention, to. come to Belgium&apos;s assistance:-(a) There must be adequate provision of military and air forces to implement the promise and intervene effectively in the event of war;(b) After the declaration, conversations with the Belgian General Staff would be necessary;(c) Belgium would have to agree to communicate to us    her   war plan and all relevant information for which we asked;(d) Belgium   should promise to afford us, after the declaration, full facilities for making any joint plans we thought necessary;(e) We should receive a guarantee from Belgium that they would do their utmost in their own defence, both against land and air attack;
(f) We mast be assured of the use of the * French ports without which the Expeditionary and Air Forces couldnot be landed and maintained.(g) We should receive a guarantee that Belgian ports would be adequately defended against naval and air attack.(h) We should be informed what Belgian forces of all kinds are to be maintained in the field.(i) We should be informed of the Belgian arrangements for anti-aircraft defence.It was suggested that a possible method of procedure would be to inform France in advance of our desire tomake a guarantee to Belgium.      It could be pointed outin doing so that such a guarantee would be valuable toFrance herself and that, therefore, we saw no reason to expect anything but support for the idea.      It would be necessary , however, to make it quite plain that ourguarantee to Belgium could not be extended to cover french territory.      It should be sufficient for France to know that in supporting Belgium we were indirectly supportingher also.SIR JOHN SIMON said that it seemed to he generally agreed that the strategical implications of the proposal should be considered by the Cabinet before a final decision was reached to make a declaration together with certain political aspects of the question.      He thought it would be necessary to submit to the Cabinet some paper which set out first &quot;essential matters which must be decided satis-factorily before implementing our proposed declaration&quot; and second,  the strategical implications of the proposal which, as agreed, should be considered by the Cabinet before a decision was made.      He would be prepared to draft a paper himself based on the discussion which had taken place hut on the  second question, the strategical implications, he would, ask the Chiefs of Staff to draft a report as soon as Poss ible.     He had in mind certain special points which he wished to include in his own paper.      These were:-
(a) In view of the impossibility of contemplating in practice a war ap:ainst Germany in v/hich Prance played no part, the necessity to consider the position vis-a-vis France and the desirability or otherwise of approaching Prance in the first instance.(b) Any approach to Prance might result, in Prane-e p.sk:lng for a corresponding declaration as to her frontier also5 a proposal which we must resist,(c) The importance of French co-operation was not merely because of her own military contribution, but also because the use of her ports and railways were essential.(d) The question whether we should act by means of a public declaration, as had been suggested, or whether it might .be preferable merely to give a plain intimation to Germany, whether public or not.(e) The French have already, entered into military conversations with Belgium under cover of the Locarno agreement.      It seemed for consideration the extent to which v/e might similarly act under cover of Locarno.(f) At the present moment France ispaying particular attention to fortifications of her own country and is apparently less inclined to come to the assistance of Belgium, fearing apparently a repetition of history at the beginning of the last war.      For us to make a declaration might be to increase the likelihood of France coming in because the possibility of Belgian resistance would thereby be appreciably increased.      This point is of particular importance in view of Belgian fears at the present time that they are,  in effect, being abandoned by France.CONCLUSIONS.It was agreed :-(a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should draft a report for submission to the Cabinet, based on the discussion which had taken place as to the &quot;essential matters which must be decided satisfactorily for implementing our proposed declaration&quot;.(b) To ask the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to report as early as possible for submission to the Cabinet on the strategic implications of the proposed declaration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 29th June, 1934.
