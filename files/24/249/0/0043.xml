Memorandum by the Minister of Health.In Cabinet Paper (155(34)) the Secretary of State for Scotland proposes to accept an amendment to the Scottish Poor Lav/- Bill now in Committee making it obligatory in poor law cases to neglect the first  1 of wounds and disability pensions. If this is approved and brought into force in Scotland, the same position must be established in England and Wales.      A special Bill is required for the purpose,  as there is no Bill in progress by which the required amendment of the lav/ can be made.
