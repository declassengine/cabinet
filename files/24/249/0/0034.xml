These notes embody proposed Instructions to the British Government Delegates as to the line they are to take as regards each of these subjects and have been drawn up by my Department where it is the one mainly concerned and by the Home Office and the Ministry of Health where the question is one for them.     The general line of these instructions has also been approved by the International Labour Committee upon v/hich all the Departments concerned are represented.Subject to any observations which my colleagues may wish to make, the Delegates will be instructed accordingly.If any serious difficulty arises in regard to the credentials of the delegates of any country, e.g. Austria, Bulgaria, Italy, arrangements will be made to consult the Foreign Office before any vote in connection with the matter is cast.(Intd.)

International Labour Conference.Eighteenth Session. - **/4 ----------....... ...............                                   boxLnstructions to bhe Government Delegates. 1.     Reduction of Jlours of Work.This question was on the Agenda of last year&apos;s Conference when it had a first reading.      Consequently, this year&apos;s Conference is in a position constitutionally to adopt a Convention on the subject.       The Government Delegates will act in accordance with the principles of the reply approved by the Cabinet which was sent to the questionnaire on the subject on 14th March.      (See CP.    ^3   (^i^       or Cmd.4584). 2.     Unemployment Insurance.A draft Convention is before the Conference.      It was hoped to confine it to insurance but there is little prospect of agreement on this basis and we must accept the principle embodied in the draft that insurajice is not the only form of  irovision to be covered and that an &quot;assistance&quot; scheme based on needs, may be used to supplement insurance or may even be the only provision that a country need make.      The draft falls short of the provision made for the unemployed in this country but this is inevitable.    The draft is generally satisfactory and it is suggested that the delegates should give their support to it subject to minor amendments and to our being able to ratify without further legislation.      They should endeavour to secure a Convention which remains in force for five years instead of ten as provided in the draft.3.     Methods of providing rest and alternation of shifts in automatic sheet glass works.This question was on the Agenda of last year&apos;s Conference and is accordingly now before the Conference for a second reading and the adoption of a Convention.      In the light of replies received to the Questionnaire issued after last year1a Conference, tho International Labour Office have circulated a draft Convention as a basis for discussion this year.     This draft Convention provides for an average working wuek of 42 hours, with spells not exceeding 8 hours, for persons employed in shifts upon certain necessarilj&apos;- continuous operations in this branch of the glass industry;    in effect this means a four-shift system.Working conditions in this industry make long hours particularly undesirable, and in their reply to the Questionnaire H.M. Government1.
2f) 9    -expressed the view that this subject might suitably be dealt with in a draft Convention, but that their final attitute towards such a Convention would depend on the lines on which the Convention was framed and on whether it was supported generally speaking by the countries in v/hich sheet glass is chiefly produced.The draft Convention circulated - though it will require amendment on some points more particularly to make its precise application and effect clearer - appeiirs to be generally satisfactory in form and indicates that the International Labour Office hive tried to meet substantially the points raised in the British reply to the Questionnaire. Messrs. Pilkington, who are the only manufacturers in this country directly concerned, are prepared to support it;    and it would be a step in the direction of securing that those of their foreign competitors who have not already done so should a.adopt four shift systems, such as are worked by Pilkingtons.     The attitude of the workers will presumably be favourable as the Convention aims at shorter hours.     When the Questionnaire was under consideration last year, the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations urged that a Convention on this subject should be opposed on the general ground that they objected to Conventions to regulate hours of work internationally;    but H.M.Government felt that they could not adopt this non posaumus attitude, particularly in view of Messrs. Pilkington&apos;s support for a Convention, and replied to the Questionnaire as above indicated.     Moreover, the policy of securing shorter hours in particular&quot;industries where this is practicable is in conformity with that adopted by II.M.Government in connection with the proposals for a 40 hour week generally.It is therefore suggested that the delegates should, subject to the drafting of the Convention being satisfactorily amended, give it their support, while making it clear that the decision of the Government as to ratification would depend on the extent to v/hich it is being ratified bythe countries in v/hich sheet glass is chiefly produced.4.     Maintenance of acquired rights and rights in course of acquisition under invalidity, old age and widows&apos; and orphans&apos; insurance on behalf of workers v/ho transfer their residence from one country to another.Six Conventions on the subject of invalidity, old age and widows1and orphans&apos; insurance were adopted at last year&apos;s Conference, and the2.
subject of the maintenance of migrants&apos; rights under such insurance was placed upon the Agenda of this year&apos;s Conference.     The discussion of this subject will be a first reading. *) 9 96 tiThe Delegates will take an opportunity of explaining that the subject is one in which this country is not greatly concerned, having regard to the small volume of migration of workers between Great Britain and other countries and to the fact that under the British Schemes of Insurance a migrant worker can qualify for full benefits after a very short period of employment in this country.     The Delegates will not, however, oppose the consultation of the Governments on the subject if that course is desired by a considerable majority of the countries represented at the Conference.5.      Partial revision of the Convention concerning Workmen&apos;s Compensation for Occupational Diseases.This is a question of revising, by the addition of further diseases to tho Schedule, a Convention which was adopted in 1925 and ratified by this country in 1926.     The Convention provides that compensation shall be payable for the occupational diseases named in the Schedule to the Convention, at rates not less than those prescribed by the law of the particular country for industrial accidents and in accordance with the general principles of such law.     The proposal now before the Conference is to add to the Schedule Silicosis and certain other diseases recommended by the Industrial Hygiene Committee of the International Labour Office.     A second proposal is to substitute in the Convention up-to-date formal articles as to ratification and denouncement and the legal effects of revising a Convention - for example as to whether the earlier Convention remains open for ratification.The law in this country as to compensation for industrial diseases is far in advance of that in most other countries; and the present Convention was adopted on our initiative.     Moreover in conjunction with South Africa theBritish Government have taken the leading part in getting compensation for silicosis put on the present Agenda.     As regards the other diseases proposed to be added to the Schedule, compensation is already payable in this country for all of them, except that in one or two cases the definitions proposed are wider that those adopted here.     Subject, however, to the definitions and other parts of the Schedule being rendered satisfactory it is suggested that the delegates should support the Convention.A further point is likely to be raised in connection with this item on theAgenda, namely, whether it should not be disposed of in a single discussioninstead of being carried over, in accordance with tho usual procedure, to asecond year.     The delegation will favour the disposal of the matter at a singlediscussion, unless circumstances show that a satisfactory Convention is more likely to be achieved by means of double discussion.3.
6&apos;    - ^SSiSyHS.1^P.f. &quot;women on underground work in mines of all kincls.This question is on the Agenda for a first discussion with a view to the adoption of a Convention on the subject next year.The form of employment in question has been prohibited in this country since 1842.   The Government Delegates,- accordingly, will vote in favour of the circulation of a questionnaire on the subject. 7.     ^yti^^^gyisi011 of Convention concerning, employment of Women duringthe night.This is a question of revising a Convention which was adopted in 1919 and ratified by this country in 1921.   The Convention prohibits night employment of women for 11 consecutive hours including the period between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.Three proposals for revision will be before the Conference:-(l) an exemption for women holding responsible positions of management and not ordinarily engaged in manual work;(2) an exemption allowing the competent authority in any country, in view of exceptional circumstances affecting the workers in a particular industry or area, and after consultation of the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, to fix for those workers 11 p.m. to 6 a.in. as the prohibited period, instead of 10 p.m.  to 5 a.m;(o) the substitution of up-to-date formal Articles as to ratification and denouncement and the legal effects of revising a Convention.The first proposal was put forward by the British Government, who took up the point in 1928, primarily with reference to the position ofwomen engineers in charge of electrical stations, and who have continuedto press the point ever since.    It came before the Conference in 1931,but just failed to secure the necessary two thirds majority at the finalvote, partly because some countries interpreted the present Convention as not applying to women in positions of management and partly because thefinal voting was on a revised convention embodying both the above proposals (l) and (2), and proposal (2) was objected to by a number of delegates.The Hague Court has since decided that women in positions of management are within the convention, and it appears from replies of Governments, that they now almost universally endorse proposal (1). The Women&apos;s Organisations generally support it, though some of them would like to go much further and remove restrictions cn the employment of4.
9   cother classes of -women.    It seems clear that the British Government -delegates should use every effort to get the proposal carried.As regards proposal (2),  the British Governments attitude so far has been rather unfavourable, on the ground that there was no proved necessity for the suggested latitude., and that the proposal goes beyond what is (or what was likely to be) permitted in factories in this country, where 10 p.m. is the latest hour up to which women may (in normal circumstances) legally be employed.   Moreover the replies of other Governments indicate rather half hearted support.   On the other hand the proposal is not unreasonable, more especially as the proposed latitude is conditional on exceptional circumstances and on consent of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations, and there have recently been indications that it might be convenient if the provisions in force in this country as to employment of women in shifts could be amended to permit such employment in special circumstances between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. instead of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.In these circumstances it is suggested that the delegates need not oppose proposal (2) and might even support it if by so doing they can further the carrying of proposal (l).8.     Organisation and co-ordination of national and international Fublie Works.This subject does not constitute a formal Item on the Agenda in the sense that the Conference can adopt a Convention or Recommendation. The Seventeenth Session of the Conference last year called for the preparation of a report on the subject for discussion at this year&apos;s Conference.    The Government delegates abstained from voting v/hen these decisions were taken.It is not possible to foretell the -procedure which will be adopted to deal with this report or the degree cf importance which will be attached to the discussion.    Therefore, precise instructions cannot be given to the Government Delegates.    In general, however, they will (i) take as little part as possible, (ii) avoid membership of any Committee which may be set up to deal with the subject, (iii) if it becomes necessary to speak, maintain the views expressed by Ministers at
the London Conference and at the Assembly of the League, and suggest that, as the League is collecting information on the subject, nothing should be done by the I.L.O, until that information is available and (iv) abstain from any vote unless some proposal of a clearly unacceptable nature is put to the Conference.
