During the campaign in East Africa large numbers of native porters were enrolled hy the East African Lahour Corps.      Nor was this a case of voluntary enlistment;    theas Kenya is concerned,  it cannot even he said that they were defending their own country:    they served and suffered and died in German territory.      The mortality among them was very heavy and cannot he accurately estimated.2.    Throughout the campaign until the very close, records were scanty and staff was deficient, and it was impossible to improvise an accurate system of registration and even to identify individuals.      It is a well-known fact that an East African native will frequently refuse to give his real name and to identify the hundreds of thousands who were recruited is impossible.      But we cannot lay our own faulty accounting at the door of the native porters or penalise the relatives of those who died on that account.3.    At the end of the War, when the accounts of the campaign were &quot;being wound up,  there were unclaimed &quot;balances due to dead or missing porters of the Native Lahour C&amp;rpsmen were conscripted for service in the campaign.So faramount ing
amounting to  155,000.      It was impossible to trace the persons to whom these sums were due.4.    Accordingly on the suggestion of the local Director of Military Lahour, with the full approval of the military and civil authorities in East Africa,  it was proposed that the balances should be paid over to the tribal organisations,  to which the men belonged.      It was well-known that native custom required the tribes to look after the dependents of those who had died or disappeared, and the suggested arrangements would accord with tribal organisation throughout East Africa.5.    So little doubt was felt as to the wisdom and justice of this course,  that in 1918 local Ordinances were passed,, with the approval of the British Commander-in-Chief, to whom the Ordinances were submitted in draft, to allocate these unclaimed balances to the tribes after a three years1 delay.6.    At the time Far Office approval was not obtained, but the arrangements had been accepted by everybody on the spot, and it was not until the end of 1920, by which time it was no longer possible to make alternative provisions, that the constitutional question was raised as to the authority of the local legislatures to direct the disposal of Imperial funds.     On this constitutional point the then Secretary of State had no alternative but to give way, but at the time it never entered the minds of the East African Governments or of the Colonial Office that acceptance of the technical legal point entailed the surrender of the equitable claim to the money due.7.    Throughout East Africa all sections of the community and all classes alike feel that a grave injusticehas
has been done in the matter of withholding these unclaimed balances.      This feeling is intensified by the knowledge that the German Government,  although forced to relinquish its territory,  took sleeps to pay arrears to their former native soldiers in Tanganyika.S.    Nor has East Africa failed to contrast the treatment accorded to tho natives who fought and died in our cause with that which we give to our own soldiers.      In the case of unclaimed balances of soldiers of the Imperial Forces who are killed in action, Parliament has provided that the money does not revert to the Exchequer, but is devoted to military charities.      Therefore,  it is said with reason in East Africa that it is only proper that similar action should be taken in regard to the unclaimed balances belonging to those native porters who were pressed into service in 1914-18.9.     I ought to make it plain that the Morris Carter Commission has recommended assistance from Imperial funds in two directions;    first, by the grant of the unclaimed balances, and secondly, by further assistance on the ground that it is owing to the action of the Imperial Government in allowing land to be alienated in the past,  that it is now necessary to compensate the tribes whose land was taken.    I have deliberately refused to accept the second claim, though it was strongly pressed by the Commission, because I felt that, while there was no doubt that the alienations which took place were made on the authority or on tho instructions of tho Government here, yet no one in this country derived any benefit^      The pay due to the dead porters stands on a totally different footing and I maintain that we have been withholding in favour of ourselves money which in justicebelongs
belongs to the natives.10.    As the Cabinet know,  I have never hesitated to resist claims made by Kenya which I thought to be unjustifiable or unsound,      I have on the contrary insisted on a hard financial course being followed to restore the finances of the country, and at my meeting with the elected members before I left Kenya I rejected firmly their claim that the Government should take over the settlers &apos; mortgages.      The fact that we have insisted on so strict a financial course in Kenya makes it the more incumbent upon us to be most scrupulous in the way we deal with this claim.11.      It would be difficult,  if not impossible, for Kenya to carry out on its own the expenditure involved by the Commission^ report.      In spite of the new taxation, the Colony can hardly balance its budget,  and drought or a further plague of locusts may again upset our calculations; there is grave fear that the long delayed rains which have just begun may be insufficient to restore the situation during the present year.12.     I was asked by the Cabinet as to the reception of the report in Kenya and I feel that I should be misleading my colleagues if I did not make it plain that refusal to accept this claim will rouse strong and bitter feeling in every section of the community.      The report of the Commission is intended to be a final settlement of many vexed questions and my colleagues, who know Kenya, will realise how important it is that it should go through with the greatest possible measure of goodwill and consent,13.    I do not wish to shirk the fact that if we admit the Kenya claim, we shall be morally bound to repay toTanganyika,
ONIAL OFFICE, Downing Street,4th May,  1934.Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar balances similarly due to dead or missing men recruited in similar circumstances. But if,  as I contend, we are morally bound to admit the Kenya claim, we cannot refuse to do so on the ground that two or three wrongs make a right.      ITor,  1 -   submit, should we be prejudiced in our review of the case by the fact that a previous Cabinet rejected it.      This Government has never been unduly bound by precedent.      Nor can I believe that the former Cabinet would have taken such a decision if they had been fully apprised of the facts,(Intlld.)  P. C.L.
