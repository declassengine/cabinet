At their Meeting on May 30th, 1934,  (Cabinet 22 (34) Conclusion 13) the Cabinet agreed, that the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for far and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should have full discretion to prepare the form of announcement of the Government&apos;s intentions in regard to the Tithe Bill and should discuss the Terms cf Reference to the proposed Royal Commission, which should subsequently he submitted to the Cabinet.The Ministers in question, other than the Chancellor of theExchequer, met i-mediately after the conclusion of the Meetingof the Cabinet and were reminded that on the 16th May, 1934,(Cabinet 21 (34) Conclusion 6) the Cabinet had agreed(a)    That there was nc objection to the proposal that the Tithe Bill should he referred to a Select Committee of the House of Lords.(h)    That at the same time an announcement should he made in the House of Lords that a Royal Commission was to be set up to enquire into the whole question of tithe with a wide terms of reference.(c) That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should discuss the terms of reference and the personnel of the Committee with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Departments concerned.(d) That the Royal Commission should he set up as soon as possible.In the course of discussion it.was pointed out that under (a) and (b) of this conclusion there would he two bodies engaged in considering this subject, namel3r the Select Committee of the House of Lords and the Royal Commission, and that it was possible that these tv/o bodies might produce conflicting recommendations.      The Government could not escape some odium by the proposed reference to the Select Committee.      In the circumstances the House of Lords might be expected to resent the proposed reference to the select Committee as it would be
realised that the proceedings in that Committee would have to he unduly expedited and that the interested parties v/ould he put to great expense to no real purpose as it would he generally appreciated that the appointment of the Royal Commission would involve the withdrawal of the Bill.It was also suggested that the best course for the Government to adopt would he to point out that at an earlier stage there had been good reason to believe that the proposals which were subsequently embodied in the Bill were generally acceptable;    after the introduction of the Bill, however, this proved not to be so and the Government had decided that it was desirable to refer the question to a Royal Commission.       It followed, therefore, that it would not be possible to proceed with the Bill pending the Royal Commission1s report.It was agreed-(1)    That an announcement of the Government&apos;s decision to set up a Royal Commission and not to proceed with the Tithe Bill pending the Royal Commission&apos;s report should be made in the House of Lords by the Secretary of State for far, if possible on Thursday, June 7th, and that the terms of this announcement should be settled by Lord Hailsham in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.(2)    That in the circumstances no useful purpose would be served by referring the Tithe Bill to a Select Committee of the House of Lords, and that accordingly Lord Hailsham&apos;s announcement should make no reference to this proposal.(3)    That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should proceed with the discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers concerned of the Terms of Reference and the Personnel of the Royal Commission with a view if possible to these matters being ready for consideration by the Cabinet at their next Meeting on Wednesday, June 6th, 1934.
