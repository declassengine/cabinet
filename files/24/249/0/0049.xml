(THIS document is THE PROPERTY OP HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).BRITANNICCOPY NO.SECRET CP. 162  (34) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,  dated 13th June,  1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in Indfa dated 13th june- 1.934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of&quot; State for &quot;India.By a resolution passed at a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee at Patna,  Congress have formally suspended, hut not withdrawn,  civil disobedience and have adopted the policy of Council entry.      There was considerable opposition on both points.     Many Congressmen were in favour of an unequivocal withdrawal of civil disobedience.      With regard to Parliamentary work,  those who had constituted the Swaraj Party did not relish finding it absorbed in Congress, while those opposed to Parliamentary work did not like its adoption as part  of Congress policy.The resolutions, however, were carried largely by the personal influence of Mr. Gandhi who has succeeded in keeping the right and left wings of Congress under one flag. In his speech he made it clear that he was still sceptical of the benefit of Parliamentary work,  but in view of the opinion of those who still had faith in Council entry he-agreed to the formation of a Parliamentary Board to control elections and guide the work inside Legislatures, but-subject,  in the matter of policy, to the general control of the All-India Congress Committee - &quot;the Congress will commit suicide if its attention is solely devoted to Legislatures. Swaraj can never come that way.      Swaraj can only come through an all-round consciousness of the ma.sses&quot;.      By restricting civil resistance to himself Mr. Gandhi still keeps the idea of civil disobedience alive;   his action is but the logical corollary of the Poona decision restricting civil disobedience to individuals and is dictated by force of circumstances.     But,  in plain English, Gandhi&apos;s statement of 7th April,  and his speech at Patna,  show that he recognises for the time being at least,  civil disobedience has failed, but that he has not lost faith in the weapon and claims the right to Use it again should opportunity offer.
Such being the attitude of Congress,  it was necessary for the Government to adopt a cautious policy. They have,  therefore, made it clear that though they are removing the ban placed upon Congress organisations by cancelling notifications under the Criminal Law Amendment Act thus enabling the Parliamentary wing to function and to prepare for the forthcoming elections to Legislative Assembly which will be held in the autumn,  the Special Law-passed by Central and Provincial Legislatures to control movements will remain in force,  and will be used should necessity arise;    and that,  if Congress or any of its branches pursue activities which are in prejudice of the Law or indicate an intention to revive civil disobedience in any form,  Government will not hesitate to re-impose the notifications which are now being withdrawn.      Government have also drawn a distinction between pure Congress organisations and organisations which,  though working in more or less close association with its objects,  are in fact revolutionary bodies.      In particular,  the ban on Red-Shirt associations in the Frontier Province which had been guilty of stirring up the trans-border tribes, and had made little concealment of their policy of driving out the British by force will not be removed.    The Red-Shirts,  though accepting the cloak of Congress, were a separate organisation and were pursuing different,  though parallel,   objects and by different methods.      Other action will be taken in the light of local conditions;    prisoners will continue to be released in accordance with the policy which has been followed for the last 15 months,  if in the opinion of Local Governments no ill effects are anticipated. The total number of such prisoners was under 1,200 at the end of April,  and is rapidly diminishing.
One of the most significant features of the Patna meeting was the omission of any pronouncement on the communal award, to which a timid reference had been made at the Ranchi Conference a few weeks before.      This presents one of the main difficulties with which Congress is faced;    on the other hand,  the Hindu Mahasabha press for the rejection of the award,   in particular,  in Bengal and the&apos;Punjab, and they are already threatening on account of the equivocal attitude of Congress on this point to set up candidates in opposition to Congress.      On the other hand, if Congress were to recommend the rejection or modification of the award,   it would lose practically all its Muslim adherents who,  though not numerically strong,  are of considerable political value to them.      The following quotation from a report received from the Government of the United Provinces shows clearly the importance which attaches to the communal question;    &quot;to moderate Hindu candidates it will not be the constitutional aspects of the White Paper which are of real concern;    it will be the fact that the communal award is embodied in the White Paper, What in England may appear to be a wide movement against the scheme of reform, will,  in part at least, be only a demonstration of Hindu dislike to the communal award.    To the greater part of the people in the Province as perhaps elsewhere in India the one vital test of constitutional changes is their effect on communal relations&quot;.This revival  of interest in the c cmrnunal award may lead to a further deterioration in the relations between the two communities for,  although there have been no very serious communal disorders,  there has been considerable increase in the total number of communal riots during recent months and feelings between the two communities
are reported to be strained;    in particular in the United Provinces, where the Muslim press continues to harp on the riots which have occurred and to give exaggerated accounts of them.     Other provinces also report incidents which show that the communal situation gives some cause for apprehension.The Bombay mill strike situation continues to improve and there is a steady increase in the number of workers in the mills.     Both here and in Nagpur the action taken against Nagpur leaders appears to have contributed to this result and it is satisfactory that there are no signs of the strike spreading to other industrial centres in the Central Provinces and that attempts to induce other workers in Bombay to join in a general strike have so far failed.
