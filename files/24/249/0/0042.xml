C.,A,6,I H IS g,,H8HL0RA11DUMbyTHIS SECRETARY Q2F STATS J?QR SCOTLAND.Clause 38(3)(b) of the Unemployment   Bill, as the Mil ns\w stands, requires that in determining the need &amp;f an applicant for an a&amp;lowanoe.under Part1.1 of the Bill, thefirst one pound of any wounds or disability pension shall be disregarded;    this provision was inserted in Committee by a Government amendment0A Bill to amend the Scottish Poor Law is at present under discussion in CoaaaitteSo    An amendment has been put down by a. number of the Government Supporters to make it obligatory upon poor law authorities in Scotland to disregard the first :sne pound of any wounds or disability pension when affording out-door relief to a poor person (whether able-bodied or not),,The provisions of Part   11 of the Unemployment Bill while transferring the care of the great mass of the able-bodied paor to the State will leave a certain proportion of them still within the charge of the Authorities,    St is difficult to maintain that in this matter of disability pensions the treatment given to the able-bodied should vary according merely as they are relieved by the Unemployment Assistance Board or by the Local Authorities,    St would be equally difficult to differentiate in this matter between the poor who are able-bodied and those Who are not in making the proposed provision.,Tho/
The option given to Local Authorities? by the Transition al Payments (Determination of Needs) Act.   1932,, to disregard certain items of income,- among which was one half of a wounds ifT disability pension, has been exercised very unequally -by various L&amp;oal Authorities in Scotland.-..Any amendment proposing that it should be made obligatory upon Local Authorities to disregard,, in addition to wounds or disability pension,, other items of income would,, of course, be resisted,,     Apart from other considerations which distinguish wounds and disability pensions from other sources of income,  a distinction can be made on the ground, that the disability pension is a diminishing charge while the other items are not;,  and that inclusion of these items would therefore Impose a permanent burden upon L&amp;cal Authorities,, This point also serves to illustrate the special nature of the charge proposed as regards wounds ar disability pensions.&quot;i shall accordingly be glad to have authority to accept in principle the proposal to put poor persons in Scotland in the same pa-si tion as the able-bodied coming within Part XX &amp;f ths   Unemployment Bill in the matter of the disregard &amp;f wous?*$s3   or disability pension when needs are being asse&amp;sedc.The proposal does not involve any charge upon Exchequer fundb0(Intlldc)     GcPoCScottish Office,,Sth June,  1934,(2)
