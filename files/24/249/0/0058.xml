THIS DOQPMEFE-IS, THSi PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEaKMEIsT. SECRET. COPY NO.    ?S ..CP .171(34) . G A B I N.E,..jE..Educational Endowments &quot;(Sogtland): Commission. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.The Endowments Commission was appointed in 1928 to review educational endowments in Scotland in accordance with the Aot passed in that year.The powers of the Commission, whioh were continued by an Aot of 1931 for a further three years, will expire on 31st December, 1934, unless oo-itinued by Parliament.About one third of the work of review has yet to be done, and I therefore propose that the powers of the Commission should be extended for a further two years.In order to meet the strong critioisms which many of the operations of the Commission have evoked I think it desirable in the continuing Bill to amend in certain respects the statutory directions given to the Commission and my powers in relation to schemes.     I propose to discuss such amendments with the Chairman of the Commission at an early data.The Treasury have intimated to me their concurrence in the proposal to extend the life of the Commission for two years    and the Scottish Universities Committee of the Privy Council (who are also ooncerned) have agreed.I accordingly ask for authority to introduce a Bill at the beginning of next Session,  and to announce this intention publicly at an early date.&quot;G.P.CM .29th June, 1934.
