MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT.(34). COPY HO._* J .     IECABINET.International Wheat Agreement. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.My colleagues will recall that on May 3rd, I brought before them the question of the attitude which we should adopt towards a proposal that had been elaborated by the International T7heat Advisory Committee for a general under-standing with regard to minimum prices at which wheat should be sold in the world market.  (See C.P.12S (34)).Further discussions on the details of this proposal took place at the sittings of the Committee in London on the 7th May, but a decision on the question of principle waa deferred from day to day owing to the discussions which wore going on behind the scenes between the chief exporting countries with regard to Argentina&apos;s demand for an increased quota. Eventually on the 11th May the various countries represented on the Committee wore asked to define their attitude, beginning with the large exporters.    The Argentine representative thereupon stated that his country was not prepared to assent to a system of minimum prices, and it was accordingly unnecessary for the official representative of the United. Kingdom to cay more than that the situation which had arisen waa not one which was contemplated in his Instructions, and that he was not therefore able to make any statement.The discussions about the Argentine quota which had begun in Rome have continued up to the present without any settlement and there is a possibility that a somewhat serious situation involving the practical breakdown of the London &apos;heat Agreement may arise.    Argentina&apos;s wheat crop is an unexpectedly large and good one and she has asked the
United States, Canada and Australia to agree to an increase of her 19-32-54 export quota from the agreed figure of 110 million to 150 million bushels.    After some discussion the three other countries offered to surrender temporarily 25 million bushels of their quotas on condition that Argentina took definite steps to reduce acreage in 1934 and otherwise to confirm her adhesion to the London Agreement.    I need not set -out the various stages of the negotiations and will only say that while the three countries made successive improvements on their original offer, Argentina showed no disposition to enter Into any substantial undertakings and was inclined to argue that the other exporting countries were not themselves carrying out their obligations under the Agreement.On the 16th May the United States Ambassador, the High Commissioner for Canada, and a representative of the High Commissioner for Australia, saw the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and myself and asked that the United Kingdom should intervene and represent to the Argentine Government the serious consequences that might follow from a breakdown of the London Agreement.    We were impressed by their representations, and I accordingly saw the Argentine Ambassador on che following day and expressed to him our feeling that it was of importance not only to the countries immediately concerned, but also to the -Torld in general that the dispute should be settled, and a breakdown of an International Agreement of this character should be avoided.    I handed him an Aide-memoire on these lines.    H.ii. Charge d&apos;Affaires at Buenos Aires -vas instructed by telegraph to communicate with the Argentine Government in the same sense.So far as can bo gathered the attitude of the Argentine Government has not changed.    On the 22nd May the three other countries offered to increase the Argentine export quota by 30 million bushels, of which 10 only should be &quot;repayable&quot; next year, the effect being to add 20 million bushels to the
total Argentine quota of 258 million bushels for the period 1933-1935 on condition that the Argentine Government . would take steps to reduce production and would generally continue to co-operate in the working of the London Agreement. thi3 offer was rejected and the Argentine Government were asked to make counter proposals in writing which has not yet been done.    The most that they have hitherto offered (unofficially) has been to take steps to encourage the sowing of maize and linseed instead of i the at, and they will    only agree to accept an addition of 30 million bushels to their quota for this year if their quota for next year ia increased by 3 or 7 million bushels.In the meantime sowing for the 1934-35 season is proceeding daily.    On the 30th May the united States Anbassador in London v?rote to the argentine Ambassador at Paris (who has been in oharge of the negotiations) summing up the present position and concluding with the following paragraph: : -&quot;Your Excellency will understand that if the Argentine Government should continue to find itsolf unablo to accept our proposals, and were not meanwhile to have come to some arrangement (which would of necessity include, a3 a matter of i-raediate urgency, the measures designed to reduce this year&apos;s wheat acreage as referred to in Point 4   of my note of May 17th) with the Governments of australla, Canada and the United States,  they would be constrained to regard the Argentine Government as having violated the Agreement if Argentine exports 3hould exceed 110 million buohels during this crop year.    In that event our Governments would take steps to inform the other Governments adhering to the International the at Agreement of the position which had arisen, and would reserve to themselves full liberty to take such action as might seem to them appropriate0.W.R.3oard of Trade.4fch June, 1934.
