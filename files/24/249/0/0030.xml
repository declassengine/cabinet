DOCUMENT IS THb PROPERTY Op HIS 3AITANHI0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. T. COPY HO.143(34).0 A 3 I N E T. UNITED KINGDOM COAL TRADE WITH ITALY. Memorandum by the President of the 3oard of Trade^1. My colleagues will remember that In my memorandum of 8th December, 1933,  (CP.290/33), I raised the question of the treatment of. United Kingdom coal in Italy and received authority to discuss the situation with the Italian Ambassador and to offer to undertake that the existing duties on Italian worked marble should not be increased, if it should appear that such an offer would seoureN the maintenance at its present dimensions of our coal exports to Italy.    I saw the Italian Ambassador on the 23rd January,1934. and again on March 28th, and in pursuance of a suggestion . that he made on the latter occasion,  the Italian Commercial Counsellor in London (Signer Ceccato) has since discussed the situation further with my Department.2.  In the course of these discussions the Commercial Counsellor outlined the following specific requests which his Government desired to put forward for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government(1) Reductions in the United Kingdom duties on:-(a) Corozo buttons.(b) Leather gloves.(c) Carnations:  (Italy, is said to have sufferedvery much from the high duty now imposed on carnations - 9d. a lb.).(d) Citric acid - a reduction to the level of theduty on tartaric acid.
9 ft 9W v? oBoric acid - an interpretation of our present duty designed to reduce the duty on this article to the level of the duty imposed on crude boron minerals.Jacquard textiles - an interpretation of the present United Kingdom duty on embroidery (30&apos;.r ad valorem) which would enable Jocquard textiles to be subject to the 20&apos;   ad valorem duty levied on other textiles,Hat hoods of fur felt - a reduction of duty.Silk manufactures - an idea as to the policyof the United Kingdom in this respect and in any case no increase of present duties.Raw silk - a reduction in the very heavy duty on this which would result in an increase -of purchases.    It was admitted that United Kingdom purchases from Italy had been stable but our requirements wore rapidly increasing and it was claimed that Italy should share in the increase.Gypsum - a reduction in duty.    It was, however, pointed out that imports from Italy are insignificant (between  4,000 and  5,0^0).Marble - no disturbance of the present rates of duty.Dairy Products:-(a) Gorgonzola cheese - in the event of a dairy products control being imposed, special consideration to be given to imports of Gorgonzola cheese on the ground that it is a luxury article and not competitive with e.g. the Dutch and Dominion products.(b) Preserved milk v/as mentioned, but it waspointed out that the imports from Italy amount to 4,000 cwts. a year only.(c) Possible marketing schemes - the ItalianGovernment desire to put in a general caveat in regard to these.    They are naturally ignorant of what our policy is as regards articles not yet controlled and are anxious.(e)it) (g)(h) (i)U)00 (2)
rV V CS3S In general Signor Ceecato explained that it i3 the policy of his Government to pay the closest attention to the halance of trade with each foreign country because of the importance of safeguarding their currency as well as for general trade reasons.     He put forward oertain figures, which had led his Government to regard Italy&apos;s trade balance with the United Kingdom as being unfavourable to her to the extent of at least  1 million. It was the desire of the Italian Government to rectify this position and it was essential for Italy not to allow the present tendency to continue.      In order to secure a satisfactory trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Italy, the Italian Government were ready in return for the concessions referred to above to increase their purchases of United Kingdom coal for the State Railways to 1 million tons a year (present purchases being practically nil).4. Whilst it seems clear on the one hand that a mere undertaking on our part to abstain from increasing the duty on Italian marble will not alone be sufficient to safeguard our exports of coal to Italy, it is equally beyond doubt that an increase of United Kingdom exports of coal for the Italian State Railways such as foreshadowed by the Italian offer would he of great benefit to the coal industry.      It would moreover particularly benefit the South Wales district which has received no advantage from the Trade Agreements concluded last year with the Scandinavian countries,      On the contrary Poland is trying to make good displacements in
Scandinavia by inroads into new markets, particularly Italy.      ^here would also be additional benefits from the increased employment for docks and shipping. The export of this quantity of coal would, it is estimated, provide full time employment for some 4,000 men in areas where unemployment is concentrated and no alternative employment is available.      I am advised that an arrangement of this character would be greatly welcomed by the coal industry which would be recovering a former export trade of the greatest importance apparently now definitely lost to the United Kingdom.     Moreover, I am assured that there will be no tendency on the part of the industry to criticise the quantity of coal guaranteed (as there was in the oase of the Agreement with Germany of 13th April 1933),      The annual consumption of the Italian State Railways is now from 2 to 2^ million tons and in 1930 we supplied 972,000 tons, in 1931 664,000 tons, in 1932 166,000 tons, and in 1933 only 47,000 tons, so that a purchase of a million tons of coal a year would more than reotore the industry to its former position.     A further consideration is that our exports of coal to Italy for domestic and industrial us.e and for public utility undertakings might at any time become subject to Italian Government control.     This trade is extremely valuable and amounted to 4.8 million tons in 1933 ( 3.8 million).      It is most desirable to avoid a diminution of it by means of Italian State control which the Italians might possibly be tempted to impose, as a further lever in obtaining v/hat they desire from the United Kingdom.
6. On the other hand, the Italian desiderata as outlined hy Signor Oeccato involve a negotiation covering a much wider field than was at first in contemplation.     The Cabinet decision of 20th December last (Cabinet 70(33) conclusion 5) authorised me to make an offer to undertake that the existing duty &quot;on Italian worked marble should not be increased if it appeared that such an offer would maintain at its present dimensions our coal exports to Italy.     The response elicited from the Italians does not indicate that this limited proposal is in any way satisfactory to them and they have imported into the discussions the general question of the balance of  trade and detailed desiderata affecting a number of manufactured articles as well as certain agricultural products.     As regards the latter I do not suppose we should have the same difficulty in meeting or approximating to the Italian requests as arose during the negotiations concluded last year with Argentina and Denmark, since these countries are primarily interested in the export of agricultural products.     As regards the Italian requests in respect of manufactured articles any movement towards meeting these would involve alterations in or consolidations of our protective import duties.      On our side we should also have to advance a number of requests for tariff concessions on our industrial exports to Italy (such as that in respect of sewing machines already mentioned).     Further discussions with the Italians therefore seem likely to involve us in a negotiation somewhat similar to that which was undertaken last year with Germany and provoked, as my colleagues will remember,  considerable criticism in parliament-. We do not as yet possess precise details as to the amount of reductions in our import duties which the Italian Government would desire hut the requests have been examined in my Department on the assumption that a promise not to increase a duty or to reduce a duty by a small amount, would be
sufficient to meet the Italian wishes in each case.      On thatassumption and assuming also that the Italians could not &quot;be induced to abandon some of their requests, a rough estimate ofthe resulting loss of employment through replacement of home produced goods by imported goods is that some 2,000 men mightbe thrown out of work in the trades directly affected.      Thisdisplacement would however be spread over a number of districts where unemployment is not nearly so serious as in the Southwales coalfield, and where other -work would be more easilyobtained.     This estimate is of course largely conjectural andit takes no account of the effect of an undertaking not toincrease materially the duties on silk goods.      That undertakingv/ould involve a reduction of duty on the raw materials and alarge consequent loss of revenue, and it could presumably begiven only if the resumed negotiations with France result in aproposal of that nature.      In that event the loss ox revenueneed not be regarded as part of the price paid for an agreementwith Italy;   but in order that we may obtain concessions inrespect of it from Italy, it would be desiiable that any negotiations with that country should be undertakensimultaneously with the discussions with France.7. I would therefore ask my colleagues to give a decisionon the following issue.-V/hether I should nov  proceed to enter into negotiations with the Italians on a limited basis, endeavouring to restrict our concessions to a narrow field and bearing in mind the desirability of obtaining additional ex-ports of South \.ales coal to Italy (if possible up to an amount of 1 million tons) and possibly also certain duty concessions;orwhether, in view of the criticism which might be raised in parliament of any further tariff concessions to foreign countries on industrial products, the discussions should be abandoned, no settlement being reached as to the treatment to be accorded by Italy to our coal trade, and endeavours by the Italians to re-adjust the balance in their favour being met so far as this is possible, by a threat ox retaliatory action by this country.
ily ovjn feeling is that we ought not to let slip this chance of helping South &quot;tales.The matter is somewhat urgent as I understand that the Italian Ambassador may be coming to see me again at an early date.V.R.Board of Trade, 18th Hay,  1934.
