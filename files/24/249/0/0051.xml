THIS DOCUMEr-g IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;o GOVERNMENT.COPY NO., n   7   IJCABIN ST. -IMTJSINATIONAL LABOUR COHERENCE, GENEVA. GOAL MINES.HOURS CONVENTION.. Proposccl instructions to British Government Delegates. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour, i.     The Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation finally decided on Monday, the 11th June, that a Tripartite Conference of the seven Countries principally concerned, including representatives of owners and men, should meet at Geneva on 26th June to discuss the possibilities of ratification of the draft Convention limiting hours of work in Coal Mines.2.       This draft Convention, which was adopted at the International Labour Conference of 1951, provides for a 7-4 hour day &quot;bank to bank&quot; with a proviso which means in the case of Great Britain 7^: hours plus one winding time.      This is a satisfactory equivalent and means a reduction of 4 hour (approximately) for all the chief European coal producing countries.3.       The attitude of Great Britain since the adoption of the draft Convention has been explained in the House of Commons by Mr. Isaac Poot and by Mr. Ernest Brown, viz., that v/e are prepared to ratify if the other six countries primarily concerned mil do so at the same time, and provided that certain technical difficulties in applying the Convention in its present form are met* It has recently been elicited - on inquiry by the International Labour Office -that at least one or two of the other countries concerned have the same technical difficulties.4.       It is suggested that the representative of the British Government should maintain the general line of policy of benevolence towards the Convention, subject to the two conditions of simultaneous ratification by the other principal European countries and of the adjustment of the technical difficulties of application referred to above, such adjustment presumably requiring a revision of the Convention.5.       Certain difficulties may arise in the course of the discussions, e.g. whether the Convention should necessarily be adopted also by some of the extra-European countx-ies before coming into force, and whether the relative wages in different countries should be considered before ratification.
(Data.)   H.   B.18th June, 1954.6.       Either or both of these points may well be affected by events in Geneva during the present Session of the International Labour Conference. It is submitted, therefore, that the British Government representative should be allowed to use his discretion to modify the policy hitherto laid down in matters of detail while adhering to it in principle. 7.       Subject to any observations which my colleagues may wish to make, the Delegates will be instructed accordingly.
