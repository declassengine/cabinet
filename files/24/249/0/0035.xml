THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1934.SECEET.Copy No. 38CP. 148 (34).CABINET.236MALTA.PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OF THE COURTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ANNEXED to this Memorandum is a despatch from the Governor of Malta and a report by Sir Alison Russell on the Maltese Courts and their procedure. My colleagues may remember that in December of last year I asked Sir Alison Russell (ex-Chief Justice of Tanganyika) to accept the post of Legal Adviser in Malta. I felt that it was necessary to have the advice and assistance of a lawyer of wide experience and proved judgment, qualities which I knew Sir Alison Russell possessed in full measure. It will be seen that he has made an exhaustive examination of the whole legal system; and his report discloses a state of.affairs so scandalous that it calls for immediate and drastic action.2.   The defect of the present judicial system is a double one : (i) The procedure of the Courts entails delays, which, in a large proportionof cases, amount to a denial of justice, (ii) The proceedings are, with negligible exceptions, conducted in the Italian language, a language which hardly any of the litigants are able to understand.The Delays.3. The main cause of the delays is the custom which prevails of dealing with cases in snippets and allowing adjournments on every occasion and on practically any excuse; and also the fact that, as the proceedings are conducted in the Italian language, continuous translations of evidence are required.The following figures serve to illustrate the delays which are occurring under the present system : (1) The number of cases pending in the Civil Court at the end of last year(2) The number of cases pending in the Commercial Court at the end of last year was as follows : was as follows : (i) Introduced before 192865 40 43 66 99 145(ii) Introduced in 1928(iii) Introduced in 1929(iv) Introduced in 1930 (v) Introduced in 1931(vi) Introduced in 1932(i) Introduced before 19289 6 3 13 24 47(ii) Introduced in 1928(iii) Introduced in 1929(iv) Introduced in 1930 (v) Introduced in 1931(vi) Introduced in 1932
(3) The number of cases pending in the Court of Appeal at the end of last year was 187.Considered in relation to the population of the Island, which is only a quarter of a million, these figures clearly point to a defective system which should be remedied without delay.In paragraph 5 of Sir Alison Russell&apos;s Report, there are cited the records of four cases held in the Superior Court in illustration of the abuses which arise in the trial of actions in the Maltese Courts. These are glaring examples of continual adjournments lasting for more than ten years before the most trivial actions were brought to an issue.Language.4. As stated above the language of the Courts is Italian. In certain cases provision is made in the law for the use of English or Maltese, but in actual practice these exceptions from the general use of Italian are negligible. It is reckoned, however, that only about 15 per cent, of the population can speak Italian. The general language of intercourse in the Island is Maltese, which all Maltese of whatever class habitually speak. Where the Maltese know a second language, it is generally English, which is far more widely used and understood in the Island than Italian.As an example of the absurdity of the present position, Sir Alison Russell, in his report, quotes the number of persons who are qualified to serve as jurors in the Island. These persons are supposed to have a sufficient knowledge of Italian to try for criminal offences their fellow-countrymen in that language. The total Maltese population is 233,035. The number of male persons between the ages of 21 and 70 is 57,959. The number of Maltese qualified by their knowledge of Italian to serve as jurors is 767. This meagre figure is very striking, even if allowance is made for the fact that a more efficient compilation of the list might give an increase in the number.5. There is only one way to reform this double abuse. We should insist upon reforms of procedure which will serve the interests of the unfortunate litigants and ensure that they get speedy and efficient justice. Sir Alison Russell deals fully with the reform of procedure, and I propose to adopt his recommen-dations. We should also lay down the principle that the proceedings must be conducted in a language which the parties themselves can understand. The case for making this Maltese is unanswerable. It is the national language of the Island and one which every Maltese speaks. The only possible difficulty is that in some cases involving technical legal argument the vocabulary of the language may not at present be adequate. The Governor, while proposing that Maltese should be the language of the Courts, suggests that this difficulty should be met by providing that in such cases the presiding judge should have the discretion to direct that English shall be used. This proposal involves a clean sweep of Italian from the Courts. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it is not essential to go so far as this in order to achieve the object which the Governor has in view and to carry through reforms which I think we are bound now to effect. The solution of the problem which I would propose is set out in the following paragraph and I hope that it will commend itself to the Cabinet.6. The use of Maltese should be insisted upon in the Courts wherever possible, except where the parties are English speaking or Italian speaking, in which case English or Italian should be used, the principle being that the proceedings should be conducted in the language which the parties understand. The difficulty presented by the alleged deficiency of Maltese in legal terminology a difficulty which I suspect is greatly exaggerated by the local lawyers should be met by the application of the same principle. If, in the opinion of the judge, it is impossible, by reason of the limitations of the language, to conduct a particular part of the proceedings in Maltese, then, and only then, should another language be used. In that event the language to be used must be that which the parties to the suit can understand. As the majority of Maltese, who know any second language, know English and not Italian, or know English better than Italian, the alternative language should be English, unless neither party knows English and both or one know Italian. In order to avoid this judicial discretion being abused by judges in the Italian interest, the non-Maltese
proceedings shall be conducted in English, unless the parties declare on oath that they do not understand English, and one or both declare on oath that they understand Italian. The declaration would be made in Court when the judge directed that a particular part of the proceedings could not be conducted in Maltese. The net result of this will in all probability be that nearly every case will be conducted in Maltese.It should, of course, be open to Counsel to cite books of reference or judgments in the language in which they are written.7. I trust that the Cabinet will authorise me to inform the Governor that, subject to the modification indicated above as regards the continued use of Italian, his proposals are in principle approved. It will be observed from the concluding paragraph of his despatch that, in that event, he will consider to what extent a change will be required in the method of legal instruction in the Malta University. It will be necessary to give legislative effect to the decision in due course, but this can be done by an amendment of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, and there is no question of legislation by the Imperial Parliament involved.(Initialled)      P.

ANNEX.Secret Despatch from General Sir David Campbell, Governor of Malta, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated April 24, 1934.The Palace, Valletta, Sir, April 24, 1934.AS&apos;you are aware, the complaints against the manner of the administration of the law in Malta have been one of the most constant features in the recent history of these Islands, and have on several occasions engaged the attention of Royal Commissions. Some of these complaints deal with the delays in disposing of cases; others (and of this category I have myself been compelled quite recently to bring two examples to your notice) deal with the partiality of certain members of the Bench. Complaints of the first category attribute the delays partly to the prevailing system of hearing cases &apos;&apos; in snippets &apos;&apos;; partly to the unwarranted adjournments; and partly to the fact that the official language of the Courts in Malta, namely, Italian, is a language not understood by more than a small fraction of the Maltese people, and therefore necessitates translation in Court, which would be unnecessary were the language of the Courts to be the language of the country.2. The fact that Italian has survived as the language of the Maltese Courts has a political aspect as well as a judicial and administrative one. I concluded my Secret despatch of the 12th June, 1933, with the following sentences : &apos;&apos; I am becoming more and more persuaded that it is the position still assigned to Italian in the legal system of Malta a position which has now become almost an anachronism which gives the propagandists in favour of Italian in Malta their raison d&apos;etre and keeps the language controversy alive. Should it ever become possible to reaffirm the principle communicated in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s despatch No. 39 of the 15th March, 1899, and subsequently departed from, I believe that the language question in Malta would very quickly find a permanent, satisfactory and logical solution.&quot;The position of Italian as the language of polite society in Malta has admittedly changed, and changed greatly, since the beginning of the British Occupation; and in this connexion I would quote the following words from my Secret despatch of the 25th October, 1932 :-&apos;&apos; At the present moment Malta, if it cannot be said to be culturally English, has become to a far lesser extent culturally Italian, except as regards the law, than it was forty or fifty years ago. For example, while the language of polite society in Malta was then Italian, it is now Maltese or English. Until the last election Malta stood some chance of becoming culturally Maltese, with English culture as the most favoured cultural &apos; second string.&apos; The present Ministry will do their best to destroy this chance, while they have lost no time already in doing their utmost to make Italian culture the first and only &apos; string.&apos; I believe that Malta has now reached the parting of the ways, and I think that it is not too much to say that the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the present moment will determine whether or not this country is to pass into the Italian cultural orbit, an eventuality which would facilitate, to say the least, its passing at some subsequent date, given a change of circumstances, into the Italian political orbit as well.&quot;The. late Ministry, during their year and a half of office, endeavoured to give an artificial fillip to the use of Italian in Malta, in defiance of the natural tendency of the present age for Maltese to improve its status as a written as well as a spoken language, and for English to be the principal second language of the educated classes. In the extracts which I enclose herewith (Enclosure I), mainly taken from the Malta and the Eco di Malta e Gozo, Dr. Mizzi&apos;s papers make an attempt to keep up the pretence that the Maltese are Italians, an attempt which is of course not taken seriously by the Maltese people, who know
the facts, and can only hope to obtain credence in Italy, for which country it is primarily intended.It may be premised that, in their daily intercourse, all Maltese judges, advocates, professional men, clergy and citizens of every description speak Maltese, and only Maltese. Nevertheless, the fact that Italian remains the language of the Law Courts, which means that all those in various ways connected with the law must therefore have a good knowledge of it, has an important bearing on the educational&quot; system of the Government of Malta. As long as it remains in this position, the Government is bound to make adequate provision for a high level of Italian teaching in the Secondary Schools and the University, with its attendant political consequences. But for this circumstance, the Maltese educational system could be readjusted to the real needs of the Maltese people of the present time; and I submit that the circumstance that Italian is still the official language of the Courts of Law has now become an anachronism and has no justification in right. I go farther, and say that it constitutes a definite impediment to the most efficient administration of justice in Malta, in addition to keeping alive a political agitation by and on behalf of Italy, which I believe would rapidly lose its raison d&apos;etre and die with the elimination of Italian from the Maltese Courts of Law. In my Secret despatch of the 17th instant I had occasion to transmit to you reports indicating a renaissance of Italian propaganda, and I take this opportunity to bring to your notice the following exceedingly interesting extract from the Debates of the Maltese Senate of the 28th February, 1923 :-&quot; (Col. Samut&apos;s motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor on the subject of certain statements which appeared in the Italian press.)Hon. Mgr. Paolo Galea (Clergy Representative, now Vicar-General to His Grace the Archbishop): It is their (the Italians&apos;) aspirations which I had an opportunity to ascertain when I resided in Italy, when I was given the right to vote at the elections, because I belonged to an unredeemed land!Hon. Rev. Prof. Michael Gonzi (Labour member, now Bishop of Gozo): It is an undoubted fact that very many in Italy think that all the Maltese desire the annexation of Malta to Italy. There is no doubt about this; I heard it myself hundreds of times. Very many in Italy, who know little of the sentiments of the Maltese in our Islands, think that we are a second Trieste or Trento. Therefore, although the expressions we are discussing to-night do not come from persons who hold public offices, yet it cannot be denied that they are an echo of the sentiments of thousands of Italians.&quot;3. The attachment of the legal profession in Malta, Bench and Bar alike, to the use of the Italian language in the Courts and in legal matters generally may be ascribed to two causes :. the first cause may be defined, for want of a &quot;better term, as a sentimental, one, and proceeds from the belief, held by many Mediterranean and Oriental peoples, that it is highly indecorous to use the language of every-day life for such important and quasi-mysterious matters as the processes of the law. In the countries which I have in mind those who are able to use speech not understood by the common people expect to derive, and frequently succeed in deriving, additional respect from those less erudite because they can make use of phraseology not understood by ordinary folk. The Chief Justice, Sir A. Mercieca, was doubtless influenced by this point of view when he said in evidence before the Royal Commission of 1931 that &quot; the extension of the use of Maltese in the oral proceedings would undoubtedly detract from the solemnity, the seriousness and decorum which characterize the Criminal Court.&quot;The other, and in my opinion the predominant, cause is, however, a severely practical one in that the members of the legal profession fear that were Italian to cease to be the official language of the Courts it would be flooded by, and the way to the Bench opened to, lawyers from the United Kingdom. If the language of the Courts were to be declared to be Maltese, with English as a secondary language, then this fear of the legal profession would necessarily to a considerable extent be allayed.4. Feeling that the time had come to make a fresh attempt to grapple with this difficult and constant problem; I requested the Legal Adviser, Sir Alison
Russell, shortly after his arrival, to undertake a confidential investigation into the function of the Courts on the broadest possible lines. Sir Alison Russell has brought to bear on the question a mind which has all the advantage of being new to Maltese problems, and produced a clear and able report making recommendations for the cure of the prevailing evils which, if bold, are, in my opinion, cogent and compelling. On the receipt of the Legal Adviser&apos;s report I submitted it for the observations of the Treasury Counsel, both as a leader of the local Bar, as a former occupant of the Bench, as one of my principal legal advisers and as being greatly experienced in the practice of the law in Malta. Sir Philip Pullicino m his turn submitted his observations on Sir Alison Russell&apos;s report. Thereupon these officers had consultations both between themselves and with me, in consequence of which they have submitted their revised recommendations so far as the languages of the Courts are concerned. I attach the following documents : (a) Sir Alison Russell&apos;s report, dated the 27th February, 1934 (Enclosure II);(b) Sir Philip Pullicino&apos;s comments on this report, dated the 2nd April, 1934(Enclosure III);(c) Sir Alison Russell&apos;s and Sir Philip Pullicino&apos;s  revised languagerecommendations, dated the 17th April, 1934 (Enclosure IV).5. Taking as my premise the belief that it is now right, on grounds of justice as well as of policy, for Italian to cease to be the language of the Courts, I had next to consider what language or languages should take its place. At first sight it seemed obvious that the language to take the place of Italian throughout should be Maltese, seeing that one of the principal objections to the use of Italian is that it is not understood by more than a very small proportion of the Maltese people. Moreover, it will be difficult to justify any possible criticism in Italy of a change if the change were to be in favour of the national language, which is habitually spoken by the entire Maltese people. Before coming to a decision on the subject I thought it best to consult confidentially, in addition to Sir Philip Pullicino, certain persons who are not only acknowledged experts in the matter, but would certainly be in favour of the contemplated changes, namely, Sir T. Zammit, Dr. Laferla and Sir Augustus Bartolo. All these gentlemen unhesitatingly informed me that, much as they sympathized with and desired the change I had in mind, it would not be possible, at present, for Maltese entirely to take the place of Italian in the Superior Courts so far as written judgments in civil cases involving complicated matters of law ai&apos;e concerned.I am bound to take into consideration this expert advice on the part of sympathizers with the contemplated reforms, and, accordingly, my recommenda-tions, so far as the languages in the Court are concerned, are, broadly, that Maltese should take the place of Italian to the extent to which I am advised that it can do so, and that, where it cannot do so, English should take the place of Italian.It will be observed that Sir Alison Russell and Sir Philip Pullicino agree that it is practicable that Maltese should be the language in criminal cases in all Courts, and that it is also practicable that Maltese should be the language in civil cases in the Magisterial Courts.  As regards civil cases in the Superior Courts  (a) Sir Alison Russell recommends that the language should be Maltese unless the presiding Judge considers that from the nature of the case the language should be English. (&amp;) Sir Philip Pullicino agrees that it would be practicable to have English as the language of the proceedings with the optional use of Maltese in the oral proceedings, a matter which might, as suggested, be left to the discretion of the Court.   He does not, however, recommend this course, as he considers that the language of the Superior Courts should be English, and not Maltese, if there is to be any change in the language of the Courts.6. Taking into consideration the reports of Sir Alison Russell and Sir Philip Pullicino and the conferences subsequently held thereon, I now submit the following specific recommendations for your favourable consideration: I. (a) That Maltese should be the language of all Courts, both Superior and Inferior, for all criminal cases : Provided that where an English-
speaking person is being tried the language of the Court shall be English.(b) That Maltese should be the language of civil cases in the Magisterial Courts: Provided that where all parties are English-speaking persons the language shall be English.(c) That in the Superior Courts the language should be Maltese or English as may be directed by the presiding Judge : Provided that where all parties are English-speaking persons the language of the Court shall be English.II. That laws be enacted and published in Maltese and English only. III. That the translation into Maltese of such laws as have not been translated into Maltese should forthwith be undertaken.7. As regards the other recommendations made by the Legal Adviser and the Treasury Counsel, I agree generally with their proposals. I consider that reforms decided on should be brought into operation forthwith, without further discussion with the judiciary, the advocates, the local politicians, or the local press.8. I have no doubt that now is the time when the question of the language of the Courts can and should be dealt with. It appears clear from the newspaper comments which have followed upon the attendance of the Legal Adviser at the Courts that sweeping reforms are anticipated, with satisfaction or apprehension as the case may be. No doubt any serious reform will be received with satisfaction by the great bulk of the people. It seems to me to be nothing short of an outrage that an ancient race of fellow-subjects, whose language is one of the oldest and most enduring languages in Europe, should have its justice administered in a foreign language because a narrow association desire for selfish reasons to retain their power of mystery. I believe that the present is a more favourable opportunity for carrying through these reforms than is likely to recur for a long period.Should you approve my proposals in principle, I will, of course, consider to what extent a change will be required in the method of legal instruction in the University.I have, &amp;c.DAVID J. M. CAMPBELL, Governor.Enclosure I.Translation of Extracts from the &quot; Malta,&quot; the i0Eco di Malta e Gozo &quot; andthe &quot; Poplu.&quot;&quot; Malta &quot; of the 6th November, 1933.The Imperial Government, with its fears regarding the integrity of the British Empire, is afraid lest the preservation of the Italian language in Malta might be prejudicial to Imperial interests, when those interests would be better assured if the Maltese were not, in any way, offended in their history and traditions, in their language and in their Religion. Dr. G. Mizzi.&quot; Malta &quot; of the 8th November, 1933.We are instead placed in the centre of the Mediterranean, under a beautiful sky, wholly Italian, and in the midst of waves which carry to us continually the warm salutations and ardent kisses of our mother country, Italy, to whose civilization we are extremely proud to belong. Dr. G. Mizzi.&quot; Malta &quot; of the Uth November, 1933.Malta is eternal, and attempts will be made in vain to push her towards the African coasts and to cancel its characteristics of a Catholic and Italian people, which cannot be confused. Enrico Mizzi.
Since the day of the submission of the Maltese population to British domination, the Italian language seemed an intolerable bugbear, put as a protection of the cultural and economic patrimony of the Maltese; and to-day, with the progress of the times, attempts are being made to gag and kill it. In fact, Italian, which was an obligatory subject for admission into the Civil Service, has been reduced to the level of a subject of secondary or lesser importance (as if the Government employees could be better qualified and cultured without a language so rich in history and literature), thus lessening, with a gesture of cynical Italophobia, this vital and millenary plant, wherefrom the Maltese have, so often and with palpable utility, drawn the fruits of their undoubted origin of race and of their pride of Italian nationality. Irgam.&quot; Eco di Malta e Gozo &quot; of the 28th December, 1933.The meditated suppression of Italian culture in Malta, or rather the many obstacles deliberately placed by the British Government in the way of the development and the existence itself of that more than secular culture in a land which is Italian in everything, except the flag, directly attack, diminish and offend the civilization of the Maltese, and, through them, the civilization of the Latin Mediterranean.4f. ^J. Jt M, Jf. JJ.TV &quot;7V ^Jt- &quot;fr TPRome has, for centuries, always destroyed Carthage. Is it possible that the British Government does not perceive that, to try to oppose again the Phoenician? to the Romans is, of itself, a most puerile game, but which might, however, become most dangerous, given present times ? If Malta were to be Anglicised by force-we do not know how and when the change would only affect the plaster and not the stone. Violence has never succeeded to restrain the spirit of a civilized people. Orders in Council cannot destroy the most Italian soul of the Maltese people whose land, even if it were to be wholly submerged in the sea that surrounds it would, from the last stone of its highest steeple, shout out &quot; Italy &apos;T before disappearing.JJ. -At. JJ. Jfc Jfc Jfe-JV &quot;TV *R&quot; *Js&quot; &quot;7VIs it possible that a little Italian, taught in the public schools of an Island which is proclaimed to be Italian, not by the Nationalists, but by mother nature, might endanger the lot of the small Mediterranean fortress and of the Empire ?&quot; Eco di Malta e Gozo &quot; of the 29th December, 1933.We, too, are very proud of our nationality, which is eminently Italian, and we cannot in any way tolerate others to do violence to what is dearest to us, after our Religion, that is to say, our language.&quot;JV* &quot;7V &apos;Jv *7v&quot; TVThe Empire could not have confidence in a bastard people, and consequently degenerate, as the Maltese people will be when violence will be done to its physionomy and its national character. We can never be transformed into an English people, as Downing Street would have us.If Almighty God wanted us to be English, He would have placed us in the North Sea; but once that Divine Providence has placed us in the midst of the Mediterranean, as the extremity of Italy (come ultimo sasso d&apos;Italia), we are, and will always remain, Italians. Aw. Gius. Mizzi.&quot; Eco di Malta e Gozo &quot; of the 30th December, 1933.We are showing by facts to the civilized world that we are determined to defend, at all costs, our characteristics of a people eminently Catholic and civilized, and that we do not, in any way, want to renounce our nationality and our language.--Aw. Gius. Mizzi.&quot; II Poplu &quot; of the 30th December, 1933.Once that the Proclamations were issued in Italian and the Authorities addressed themselves in Italian to the Maltese, does this mean that the Maltese were Phoenicians, as the Berka and those who read and write in it say, or that, for thousands of years, our language was the Italian language? Levantin.
Enclosure II. Report on the Malta Courts of Law.I AM directed to make a report on reforms which I may consider practicable and desirable in the administration of the Malta Courts.2.   I am informed that it is desirable that this report should be made as soon as possible; and though I should have preferred to have been a longer time in Malta before submitting the report, I do not see reason to suppose that I should be likely to vary the definite conclusions at which I have arrived.   The question, moreover, is not raised by any means for the first time, and there is a great amount of material available in convenient printed form, especially the following:  (a) Minutes of Evidence and Report of the Royal Commission, 1912.   (In this report referred to as the R.C. 1912, M. of E., and the R.C. 1912, Report.)(&amp;) The Remarks of the Chamber of Advocates of Malta on the Report of the Royal Commission, 1912. (In this report referred to as the C. of A., 1912.)(c) The Minutes of Evidence and Report of the Royal Commission, 1931. (In this report referred to as the R.C. 1931, M. of E., and the R.C. 1931, Report.)I have had access to a great deal of information contained in the files in the Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s Office dealing with this question.I have attended sittings of the courts, and obtained information from the judges, magistrates, and the registrar.Statements of fact and advice have been freely given to me by the newspapers of the different Parties.I have had the great advantage of discussing these matters with the Treasury Counsel, and although Sir Philip Pullicino has not found it possible to agree with all the views expressed in this report, I should like to express my thanks to him for the way in which he has placed his wide knowledge of the courts as an advocate, as a judge, and as Treasury Counsel, at my disposal.3. The state of business in the Superior Courts is very serious, and warrants any drastic steps that may be considered desirable. The delay in the trial of actions is such that it frequently amounts to a denial of justice. It will be observed that in the Superior Courts during the year 1933 the number of proceedings commenced was 1,921, and the number disposed of by judgment of the court was 1,354.The position as regards the magistrates court is satisfactory.4. The following table furnished by the registrar is a statement of the position of the work in the Superior Courts : Civil Court.(a) Number of cases pending on the 1st January, 1933 ... (6) Number of cases in which proceedings were introduced between the 1st January, 1933, and the 31st December, 1933877978c&quot; Malta &quot; of the 22nd March, 1934.It is most natural, therefore, that there must be Italian schools in Malta which, more than in any other country, must be open to all, because we are all Italians, belonging to the same family and consequently entitled to receive the same education. The only difference between us and the Italians is this ; that we are subject politically to England, while Italians are under the auspices of their National Government.   That is all.Tv* &quot;W&quot; &quot;7T ifLanguage is not the only bond that unites Malta to Italy: there are her history and traditions which bind her to Italy; and above all there is Divine Providence which has placed her as the extreme end of Italy just as it had placed Trento and Trieste as the inevitable frontier of Italy.

6.   A perusal of the records explains why it is that records sometimes close on a sad note &quot; Adjourned sine die.    No further interest being shown in suit by plaintiff&quot; (after four years).. &quot; Adjourned sine die.   Plaintiff and his counsel having failed to appear &quot; (after nine years).&quot; Adjourned sine die.   Plaintiff having left the Island &quot; (after eight years).7.   Opposition to reform may be expected on the part of the judges and the advocates.  A perusal of the Remarks of the Chamber of Advocates of Malta on the Report of the Royal Commission, 1912, shows inexpugnable reluctance to c. of A., reform.   Indeed, the Chamber states its firm conviction that the delays are not p-9, xvi-to be attributed to any defect inherent in the law, but to causes outside the law, which are purely transitory.  But the delays still continue.Again, such a reform as allowing plaintiff and defendant to give evidence in o. of a:, their own causes met with the strongest opposition.   The advocates debate at pp- an   &apos;   &apos; length the question, if. the conflict between witnesses other than the parties often makes it difficult to arrive at the truth, what would the position of the judge be if the evidence of the parties were added ?  By Law XV of 1913 it was enacted organization that the parties might give evidence in their own causes.   This reform has and Civil worked well. s.*6ra*wre&apos;In dealing with questions of delay, the advocates strongly disagree with the Q.   a^ opinion of the Royal Commissioners that speedy trial is in itself a justice, and pp&apos;   an entrench themselves behind the doctrine that &quot;the defence of a citizen&apos;s rights and therefore the search of juridical truth should be the aim of every juridical organization, and should prevail over every other consideration, including that of celerity.&quot;8.   The question of reforming the administration of the Malta Courts falls into two main questions : (a) The question of the language of the courts.(b) The question of procedure.9. As regards the Question of the Language of the Courts. It may be premised that all Maltese habitually speak Maltese : judges, advocates, registrars, commercial men, and citizens of every description, all, without exception, use Maltese, and only Maltese, as the language of daily intercourse.10. In 1931 the number of Maltese speaking also Italian amounted to 15-62 per cent, of the Maltese population; but it is clear that, as is stated in the Census Report for 1931, page XXXV, some of the persons who showed themselves as speaking Italian possessed probably only a superficial knowledge of the language they professed to speak. It may be said that practically every Maltese who knows Italian also knows English equally well or better.11. A more accurate estimate of the number of Maltese speaking also Italian is that supplied by the list of persons who are qualified to serve as jurors. These persons are supposed* to have a sufficient knowledge of Italian to try for criminal offences their fellow-countrymen in that language. The total number of Maltese in these Islands is 233,035, the number of male persons between the ages of 21 and 70 being 57,959. The number of Maltese qualified to serve as jurors is 767.12.   The following is a brief statement of the present position of the language of the courts : (i) The language of the courts is declared to be Italian, (ii) In civil cases, an exception is made for an English-speaking person. In such cases, any judge, advocate or referee may, if he tvishes to do so, speak English&apos;.(It may be noted that by Law XVI of 1929 provision was made that on the application of any party the court shall order the cause to be conducted in Maltese.  This provision remained a dead letter, since* The word supposed Is used by the Chief Justice, Sir A Mercieoa, E.C., 1931, p. 178, 1405. [10115] d
only an ill-advised litigant would ask that his case should be tried in Maltese. With a change of Government this law was immediately repealed, by Law XI of 1932.) (iii) In criminal cases the court must ask the accused whether he is an English-speaking person or a Maltese-speaking person. If the accused is an English-speaking person, the oral proceedings are conducted in English. If the accused in a Maltese-speaking person, the oral proceedings are in Maltese. If the accused makes no declaration on the subject, he is tried in the Italian language.(In trivial cases, the accused sometimes declares himself to be a Maltese-speaking person and then the oral proceedings are in Maltese; but in serious cases, the accused, well-advised by his advocate, usually makes no declaration on the subject and he is then tried in Italian.)13. As regards the question whether Maltese is or is not an adequate language for use in the courts there appears a divergence of opinion. The following are extracts from the minutes of evidence on this matter given before the Royal Commission of 1931 : p. 178, Maltese, being chiefly a conversational language, is manifestly inadequateQ. 1401 (d), f.Q ke ^e me^ium Qf expression in discussions which are necessarily elaborateand technical. The lack of appropriate terms to denote the legal phraseology and to express abstract conceptions must seriously hamper the efforts of counsel for defence to successfully convey&apos; their arguments to the jury. A consequent diminution of the persuasive efficacy of their pleadings will obviously ensue, and a corresponding detriment of the interests of their client. The same may be said of the statements of the Public Prosecutor and the address of the court in their connexion with the proper administration of justice. Sir Arturo Mercieca.p. 179, I would not say there is not sufficient terminology.   I would say thereQ&apos;    &apos; is no terminology. Sir Arturo Mercieca.p. 79, .... one must come to the conclusion that it is better to have English q. 837,839. only rather than, from a sentimental point of view, to stick to Maltese.....It is criminal to try to make it a sentimental question. Dr. C. MifsudBonnici.p. 275, .... impossibility in practice of drawing up contracts in Maltese. q-1762-    - Notary S. Borg Olivier.p. 198, I say that if Maltese can be used for the purpose of religion and theq. 1487,1489. pulpit and for scientific books, it can be used for the purposes of law..... Maltese is absolutely suitable for expressing conceptions.-Sir Augustus Bartolo.p. 27i, They say it is no use introducing Maltese into the law courts becauseQ-1749. people do not understand the legal terms.   That is absurd.   All Malteseunderstand Maltese, and few know anything else. Sir Augustus Bartolo.p. 22, No difficulty will be experienced in reality.   The difficulty is sentimental&apos; &quot; with the lawyers.....Most of the clients do not understand a word of whatis going on in court and cannot correct their lawyers or give them normal assistance. Lord Strickland.p. 285, The old innuendo that Maltese is a poor patois of a lot of bad Arabic isQ. 1868,1870. a gross libel.   It is an ancient and interesting language.....Every childfrom the lowest to the highest talks nothing but Maltese. In intercourse with everybody in the island Maltese alone is used. Sir Themistocles Zammit.p. 190, As a matter of fact I maintain it is necessary for the administration ofQ-1467, justice that the Maltese language should be introduced in the law courts.   Itis not enough that the judges and magistrates administer justice impartially.It is necessary that the people should feel that it is being administeredimpartially-Mr. R. Hamilton.P-179) As a hypothesis I may say that it is possible for all the cases in the courtQ. 1408, to-morrow, criminal and civil cases, to be conducted in Maltese, and the
mItalian language abolished on the strength of Act XVI of 1929 * if in any case only one of the parties asks for the proceedings to be conducted in Maltese. Whether that is in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution or not, I leave you to decide. Sir Arturo Mercieca.14. The above extracts may be sufficient to indicate the wide divergence of opinion. A perusal of the evidence before the Eoyal Commission, 1931, leaves me with the impression that the matter is determined by the professional or political conceptions of the witness.For example, I am not impressed with the evidence of Sir Arturo Mercieca, p. 178, where he would appear to think that there would be difficulty in the use of the Q-1401-word &quot; accusat&quot; as a Maltese substitute for the word &quot; accusato.&quot;   The Maltese are an unusually intelligent people, and I cannot think that the use of the word &quot; accusat &quot; would give rise to any difficulty.   Moreover, words to which he refers p. l&amp;o, as being words which would cause great difficulty in Maltese are, it is stated, words Q-1471-which have been used by the people as pure Maltese words.It cannot, it is thought, be a detached point of view which urges that in criminal trials, which are almost always mere questions of fact for the jury &quot;the lack of appropriate terms in Maltese to denote legal phraseology r.c. 1931, and to express abstract conceptions must seriously hamper the efforts of p &quot;7f8E&apos;&apos; counsel for defence to successfully convey their arguments to the jury.   A q.&apos;i4oi(d). consequent diminution of the persuasive efficacy of their pleadings will obviously ensue, and a corresponding detriment of the interests of their client. The same may be said of the statements of the Public Prosecutor and the address of the court in their connexion with the proper administration of justice.&quot; Sir A. Mercieca. IOr which urges that &quot;the extension of the use of Maltese in the oral proceedings would p. 179, undoubtedly detract from the solemnity, the seriousness and decorum, which    1408 ^ characterize the Criminal Court, and which are a not unimportant factor of the influence which the penal proceedings should exercise on the minds of the people for the prevention of crimes and the maintenance of peace and order.&quot; Sir A. Mercieca.Again, I am not impressed with the evidence of Dr. Giuseppe Micallef, who p- 36^ appears to be so concerned for the purity of the Maltese language that he regards ^&apos;21 &apos; any addition of foreign elements, whether they are necessary or not, as a &quot; source of corruption.&apos;&apos;   But it is clear that he is considering the whole matter, not so much from the point of view of the Maltese language as that he holds it to be &quot;a q] 2176. wicked manoeuvre to supplant Italian.&quot;15. The advocates would seem to imply that the basis of Maltese law is Italian law.   But this is far from being-the case. .As regards the criminal law, this is based on the English law.As regards the civil law and procedure, this is based on the Code Napoleon and upon English procedure.As regards the, law of evidence, this is based on the English law. When it happens that English authorities are referred to they are referred to in English.16. Moreover, the court is not bound by authority, and decides cases as in its opinion-they should be decided. Authorities are, therefore, not very frequently referred to. Only on one occasion was an authority referred to during my visits to the courts--a French commentary on the Code Napoleon, translated into Italian. There is, of course, no objection to referring to English, French or Italian authorities in court in English, Italian or French, as occasion arises.17. The attitude of the legal profession as regards this matter cannot be more aptly described than in the following passage from A Short History of English Latv, by Edward Jenks : &apos;&apos; Again, amid the thick darkness of the 18th century, we see a point r.c. vast, of light in the Statute of the year 1731, which enacted that the proceedings p $e^&apos; in aH courts in England should be conducted in English, and such of them that were written should be written in ordinary legible hand and not in the* Repealed by Act XI of 1932. [10115] d 2
mediaeval character known as Court hand. Needless to say, there were not wanting in those days great men who foresaw in the change the downfall of all things, including the legal profession, and who brought forward the quaintest arguments in opposition to the proposal, one of the best known being the contention that the absence from legal documents of the quaint barbarisms of the neo-Latin of the Year Books would injure the study of classic literature.&quot;18.   In a civil trial in which Maltese are concerned the procedure is as follows : The advocate opens his case in Italian. The witness is called, his evidence is taken in Maltese, the witness, the advocate and the judge frequently talking and discussing in Maltese. There then is a pause, while the judge dictates to the registrar a summary in Italian of what has been said by the witness. The registrar takes the summary down in Italian. The evidence of the witness having been completed in this way, the Italian summary is re-translated to the witness in Maltese by the registrar, a memorandum being made that this has been done. The evidence for the plaintiff having been completed in this way, the advocate for the defendant addresses the court in Italian. The witnesses for the defence are called, their evidence given in Maltese, as before, witnesses, advocate and judge freely joining in discussion in Maltese, the summary of the evidence is dictated by the judge in Italian, taken down by the registrar in Italian, re-translated into Maltese to the witness. The advocate for the defendant addresses the court in Italian. The advocate for the plaintiff addresses the court in reply in Italian.   Judgment is delivered and entered in Italian.It may be stated that, though the law expressly lays down that the summary shall be read over to the witness and that the reading of the evidence shall be recorded by a footnote before the registrar signs the evidence, this is, in fact, frequently not done; and it is by no means impossible that cases should occur in which the summary does not represent what the witness intended to say.The only thing that a litigant understands during the whole course of the trial is the evidence; and even this, if it should be given in Italian in the first instance, is not in practice interpreted to him.19. In a criminal trial, unless the accused is ill-advised enough to declare himself a Maltese-speaking person (see paragraph 12), the procedure is as follows : In a magisterial court the charge is drawn up in Italian, and explained to the accused in Maltese, who pleads in Maltese. Evidence is given in Maltese. A summary is dictated by the magistrate in Italian and taken down by the registrar. This summary is read over to the witness. All parties freely use Maltese.  Judgment is given in Italian.In a case coming before the superior courts, the preliminary enquiry is held before a magistrate. The witnesses give their evidence in Maltese. The evidence is interpreted by the magistrate and taken down by the registrar in Italian. The committal is made in Italian.When the case comes before the superior court, the charge, drawn up in Italian, is explained to the accused in Maltese, who pleads in Maltese.   The prosecutor opens his case to the Maltese jurors, who are supposed to know Italian, in Italian.   The witnesses are called and give evidence in Maltese.   The witnesses, advocate and judge, and occasionally the jury, freely use Maltese. The evidence is not recorded, but the judge may make notes.  Then the defending advocate opens his case to the jury in Italian.   Witnesses for the defence give evidence in Maltese.   The judge sums up to the jury in Italian.   The jury return their verdict in Italian, and judgment is given in Italian.   The accused has not the remotest idea what is being said, or how his case is being handled, and nobody explains anything to him.   All he understands is the charge and R.c. of 1931,    the evidence produced.   Everyone in court understands Maltese, and the only M- of e., p. 178, reason why it is stated that the use of Italian in the trial is essential is that the Q-       &apos;&apos;      advocate for the prosecution and the advocate for the defence would not be ableOrdinance IV of 1854, S. 605.
to put the case in Maltese to the jurors, who do know Maltese and are supposed to know Italian.The procedure appears to be indefensible.There have been a few cases when the accused has declared himself a Maltese-speaking person, and the trials have been held in Maltese without difficulty.20.   The delays caused by the unnecessary translation of evidence from Maltese into Italian is considerable.21.   The returns of the Malta Public Library and Branch Libraries for 1932-33 are worthy or note : English books issued .. ... 21,838Maltese books issued ... ... 14,394Italian books issued ... ... 8,56422.   The following newspapers and periodicals are published in Malta : Maltese.     English.    Italian.Daily ... ... 2 4 1Bi-weekly   ... ... 1Weekly      ... ... 5 3Fortnightly ... 2Monthly     ... ... ... 2Occasional ... ... 6 ...23.   The Police Laws were recently translated into and published in Maltese, without any difficulty being encountered.24. It must be considered strangely anomalous that, without ascertainable reason other than custom, the laws of Malta continue to be enacted only in English and Italian, languages that, so far as fully 90 per cent, of the population are concerned, might just as well be Chinese and Hindustani.25. The laws will in a few months be in a collected revised edition; two volumes out of three have been published. A translation should be made into Maltese. I am informed that no unusual difficulty may be expected in doing this. Provision should be made in any reform that, pending the translation into Maltese, it shall be sufficient to refer to or to quote any provision of law in English.26. The language of an ancient race, which has persisted for a thousand years and more before the Italiian language was created; in which books, newspapers, periodicals are published; in which ecclesiastical addresses are published; in which laws have been published; in which daily intercourse is exclusively carried on by the citizens is nevertheless declared, by what can only be described as a closed and narrow oligarchy, as incapable of dealing with their mystery.27. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that, with goodwill, there would not be the least difficulty in conducting the work of the courts in Maltese.28. I strongly recommend that the language of the civil and criminal courts be declared to be Maltese, with exception for English-speaking and Italian-speaking persons who do not know Maltese.I strongly recommend that the laws be enacted and published in Maltese and English.It seems to me that the time has come to make the change to Maltese as the national language, a change to which only the legal profession can object.29. Whatever is decided should be made clear, no avenue being left, as is described in paragraph 12, whereby judges and advocates now try in Italian criminal cases in which Maltese are concerned, which were really intended by the provisions of law to be tried in Maltese.II.-As regards the Question of Procedure.30. Proposals have been made for speeding up the courts by amending procedure.   But it appears to me that the procedure as it stands, which is based
Section 140.Section 143. Section 153.Section 158.Section 173.Section 175. Section 179.Section 191.Section 185.R.C. 1931, M. of E., p. 169, Q. 1321.on English procedure, does not really require amendment. The problem is, how to ensure that the judges shall exercise the powers which they already have for insisting on expedition on the part of the advocates, instead of readily accepting any reason, however inadequate, for postponing their cases.31. There are two methods prescribed by the law for preparing a case for trial. The sections cited in the margin refer to sections of the laws of Organization and Civil Procedure.The first method commences by way of libel. A libel corresponds to what is known as a statement of claim. It must contain a clear and concise statement of the facts in separate paragraphs, express reference to any document, and a demand clearly and correctly specifying the object in view. To this statement of claim, the defendant must file an answer, which corresponds to the statement of defence, in which the defendant must deny, admit or explain the circumstances of the facts set out in the libel or statement of claim. Thereupon there is a reply by the plaintiff, and the preliminary proceedings are then closed. The case is now ready for trial, and there is no reason why the proceedings should not go on continuously until they are concluded.The other method of proceeding is by way of citation. A citation summonses the defendant to appear before the court in order to show cause why the demand in the citation should not be admitted. The citation is to contain clear and correct statement of the object and the cause of the demand. In reply to the citation the defendant files a statement indicating his pleadings. In general, a statement by the defendant to the effect that he does not admit the claim is accepted by the court as sufficient. Thereupon, the defendant comes before the court and attempts to satisfy the court that he has a good defence to the action, disclosing such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend. If he satisfies the court that he is entitled to defend, then leave is given to him to defend. In such cases the action is then tried and determined in the ordinary course of oral proceedings.32. A proceeding instituted by way of libel means that plaintiff and defendant must clearly understand the case and allege and admit or deny definite facts and be ready for trial on the stated day; while a proceeding by way of citation is an easier and more informal method. It is clear that proceedings by way of libel require a great deal more concentration and energy on the part of the&apos;advocates than a proceeding by the rather casual method of citation.33.   Section 185 provides No nullity results if the cause which ought to have been commenced by way of libel is commenced by way of citation, unless an exception is taken in due time; and that, notwithstanding that exception is taken, the court shall not order the proceeding to be by way of libel,, unless it considers such proceedings to be necessary for the instruction of the cause.34. It was intended that serious cases should be commenced by libel (pleadings); and that cases in which the facts were not in dispute or which require prompt expedition, should be commenced by citation. But gradually all cases have come to be commenced by citation, and a case commenced by libel is now very rare. The method of citation is readily adopted by busy advocates, who, instead of getting down to their cases and commencing by a definite pleading, find it easier to commence with a general claim, to go before the court, and by a series of more or less informal conversations and many adjournments gradually to evolve their case.35. The remarkable thing is that this easy-going method is encouraged by the bench.   This is what is meant by the Chief Justice when he says : &quot; Our system is different from that of England in that, when a suit is instituted, it goes immediately before the court; the trial is elaborated: witnesses are heard; pleadings are heard, and interlocutory decrees are given by the court by stages until the final judgment is delivered. I understand that in England when a case is to be tried a date is fixed for its hearing, the details of the case having already been prepared, affidavits having been drawn, and the pleadings having been put in writing. The judge has everything ready for him on which to deliver a judgment after hearing the witnesses viva voce.&quot;
But the procedure stated by the Chief Justice was never intended by the procedure code, which, as has been said, substantially follows the English procedure.36. The fact of the matter is that in the conduct of proceedings, the advocates do not come before the court for a hearing with their cases prepared. P-7,Xiii. Cases are gradually worked up, as is described in the Remarks of the Chamber of Advocates, 1912. The plaintiff opens his case and calls a witness or two, and then from discussion that takes place, it appears that some more evidence is wanted, and an adjournment is made to enable such evidence as may from time to time appear to be desirable to be called as the case develops. Then the advocate for the defence, who has not complied with the-provisions of the procedure code, but who has merely put in a general denial of the; claim, gradually finds out what sort of evidence would assist his case, and adjournments are allowed from time to time in order that he may discover what evidence he can find. - So the case drifts on. It is considered much more important that no risk should be run of cases being won or lost through the lack of preparation on the part of the advocates than that speedy justice should be dispensed. It is difficult to remedy this matter, since the attitude of the judges themselves is not directed to speed, but is an attitude which readily accepts postponements.37. There are elaborate provisions dealing with the &quot; desertion of causes &quot; contained in the Laws of Civil Procedure, Title XIV. These provisions are defeated by the simple expedient of setting down the case for hearing just before the time when the provisions dealing with the desertion of causes would come into effect, and having it adjourned; and then the time commences to run again from that adjournment.38.   It appears clear that the main causes of the delays which occur in the Malta courts are (a) the custom of the courts in dealing with cases in what has been described by the Royal Commission, 1931, as snippets.(b) the custom of the courts to allow adjournments on every occasion and forany excuse.(c) the prolonged delays which take place when cases are confided to&quot;experts,&quot; unlimited adjournments being allowed without adequate reasons. It is hoped that a recent Ordinance, IV of 1934, which prohibits an expert from having more than two cases referred to him at the same time, will, through the self interest of the expert, secure greater expedition in making reports.(d) the unnecessary translation of evidence from Maltese into Italian.39. The trial of cases in snippets is not enjoined by the code of procedure, but appears gradually to have become the custom of the courts. The defence made by the Chief Justice of the custom of putting 50 or 60 cases daily in the list and R.c. 1931, dealing with them in snippets is characterized by the Royal Commission, 1931, R p- 10S-as remarkable. Indeed, it is so. The Chief Justice and other judges adhered to this defence in conversations which I had with them. They seem to think that, so long as something was being done in a case, it did not really matter how many times it was adjourned. If, they said, cases were taken in order and decided, why, it might be two or three years before other cases were begun. As matters at present stand, advocates who feel that they have a bad case make efforts to delay the proceedings as much as possible. By such delays their clients have little to lose and possibly much to gain. Change in the personnel of the court may at times bring about a change in the position of the lawsuit. Delays in the long run facilitate compromises, plaintiffs being inclined, after a number of delays, to renounce part of their claim in return for something in hand; and justice is, in fact, denied.40. An effort at reform was made by Ordinance XV of 1932, an Ordinance to amend the Laws of Organization and Civil Procedure. This Ordinance was to come into force on the 1st January, 1933.In the meantime, the Nationalist Government, which is influenced by the legal profession, had come into power. Thereupon, by Act VI of 1932, the coming into operation of Law XV of 1932 was postponed to a day to be fixed by way of resolution of both Houses of Pai*liament. No resolution has been passed; and, accordingly, the Ordinance XV of 1932 has never come into force.
A Bill to amend the law of Civil Procedure, based on Ordinance XV of 1932, was introduced by the Nationalist Government, but was not proceeded with before the Nationalist Government was dismissed.41.   There are three main suggestions for reform contained in Ordinance XV of 1932 :-(1) By section 4, judges&apos; delegates were to be appointed to take the sworn statements of contending parties and of their witnesses. Reference should be made to the Report of the Commission to revise the Laws of Civil Procedure, paragraphs 6-11.This reform was omitted in the Bill prepared by the Nationalist Government.I am reluctant to express an opinion contrary to the provisions put forward by the experienced Committee who drafted the Ordinance, which was approved by the Secretary of State; but I feel compelled to say that it appears to me to be undesirable for a judge in contentious cases not to see the demeanour of witnesses when giving evidence. Moreover, the appointment of delegates means an increase in staff, and it would seem better to appoint another judge rather than these delegates. But the Royal Commissioners, 1912, emphatically recorded their opinion that the judicial establishments were out of proportion to the income and needs of the Island and demanded drastic reduction. Further, cases are very readily transferred by the judges to &quot;experts&quot; for report. I consider that the present judicial establishments are more than sufficient for the amount and weight of judicial business.(2) By sections 22, 25, 26, it is provided that when proceedings are commenced by citation the parties shall file declarations to be confirmed on oath containing a clear and detailed statement of facts upon which they propose to rely and the names of witnesses.These provisions, in effect, bring trials commenced by citation into the same line of procedure as trials commenced by libel, and it might have been sufficient to declare that all cases should be commenced by libel. To do so, however, would be to imply to the present generation of advocates that the trial was to be still more formal and still further delays were to be expected. I agree, therefore, that it is better to leave the procedure by way of libel as it stands in unused obscurity, and to amend the procedure by way of citation as is directed in these sections.. I suggest further that upon these statements being filed it should be prescribed that at the first sitting the court and advocates go through the statements, and discuss and ascertain what is admitted and what is denied; and so settle what are the issues of fact, and so far as possible of law, which lie between the parties. These provisions should be based on the provisions of the Indian code of procedure. When the issues have been determined, it should be provided that the case be set down for trial and tried to a conclusion; no adjournment being admissible, save in exceptional cases for reasons to be recorded by a judge.(3) By sections 9 and 40, it is provided that the jurisdiction of the inferior courts should be raised to  10 and there should be no appeal in cases not exceeding  5. I agree with this proposal. It is a long time since the jurisdiction of magistrates courts was fixed at  5 and the value of money has changed since then. Moreover, I am satisfied that the inferior courts could readily cope with the increased work. I would recommend that the fees payable to advocates for appearance in the magisterial courts should be increased to 5s. in respect of any claim up to  2 10.9., 10s. for any claim up to  5, and  1 up to  10. At present the fees are 2s. up to  2, and Is. per  1 when the claim exceeds  2; these fees are inadequate and merely encourage trivial litigation.There are a number of minor provisions contained in Ordinance XV of 1932 with which I agree.  With the exception of the provision as to judges&apos; delegates
to which I have referred above and subject to some additions as mentioned in this memorandum I consider that Ordinance XV of 1932, should be brought into effect.42. But the Ordinance does not deal sufficiently with the main cause of the delays in the court and that is, the frequent adjournments. Section 39 of the Ordinance provides that the registrar shall keep a proces-verbal, to be inserted in the record, of the grounds of each adjournment of the case and anything that has been done in each sitting.It seems to me, however, that the hands of the judges require strengthening or even forcing by express provision of law. If the judges were resolute to avoid delay, they would find the law as it stands sufficient for this purpose. But adjournments are granted for the most insufficient reasons, particularly on the ground that one or both of the advocates are engaged in another court. There is no system by which advocates have partners who could attend to different matters in different courts at the same time, nor is there any system of devils. Accordingly, if an advocate concerned in a case is engaged elsewhere he simply does not appear. The case is then called. The advocate is summoned three times and he sends a message to the court to say that he is already engaged. The case is then adjourned. On the next occasion it may be that the advocate on the other side is engaged, and thereupon the case is again adjourned. In the mean-time, the witnesses who may have come, being summoned, return to their homes and nothing has been done. This may happen on many occasions, and then it may happen that the witness does not appear. The case is again adjourned. These adjournments consume a very great deal of time of the court. Forty or fifty cases are put in the list, because experience has shown that the far greater number will be adjourned for one reason or another. The calling of the cases and the waiting for the advocates may take as much as a minute or two minutes each, and if thirty out of forty cases are uselessly called in this way, an hour of the time of the court may be taken in merely calling the cases. This appears to be an abuse which must be dealt with firmly.43. I do not think that in present circumstances it can be expected that the judges themselves would be prepared to take a strong line to combat this long-standing custom; and I think it would be necessary to make definite provision by law to the effect that it shall be unlawful for an adjournment of a case to be made solely on the ground that the advocate concerned in the case is engaged elsewhere, and that trial of the case shall proceed when it is reached, unless it be shown that the advocate concerned is unable to attend owing to illness. This is a new conception for Malta, though the judges enforce it in England and elsewhere in the Empire. The great bulk of the work is held in the hands of a few advocates, who, in present circumstances, make the procedure of the court serve their personal convenience. If strong steps in this direction are not taken, I can see no hope of improving the present state of affairs in the courts. It is unfair that one of the parties should be subjected to endless delays because the other party has engaged an advocate who is so busy that he cannot attend to the case. The leading advocates must be compelled to take partners or devils. I believe that such a course would be accepted with relief, save by a few busy advocates.44. If it is determined to make Maltese the language of the courts, some amendment would be required in the Notarial Profession and Notarial Archives Act, 1927. This Act has passed through an experience similar to that of the Civil Procedure Act, 1932.By section 33, notarial acts are to be written in the Italian language, and an interpretation in Maltese, when required for the intelligence of the parties, is to be made by the notary. Provision is also made for the drawing up of a document in the English language. Under this Act it would appear that the use of Maltese was excluded.Section 33 was replaced by section 1 of Act XVII of 1929, by which notarial deeds were to be drawn up in the language chosen by the parties.By Act XIII of 1933, which was passed by the Nationalist Government, the position which existed under the Act of 1927 was reverted to and notarial acts were to be written in the Italian language. Where the Maltese language is used at the request of the parties and it is known by the witness and by the notary, the translation into Italian is drawn up by the notary and both documents are signed by the parties.
If it is determined to make Maltese the language of the courts, then it will be desirable to declare that notarial acts shall be written in Maltese, or in English if the contracting parties shall so desire.45.   Section 38 of the Law of Civil Procedure provides that His Majesty&apos;s Judges and the Magistrates have the power to make regu-lations for the respective courts over which they preside, for the routine to be followed in the trial of cases and in procedure, for the Registry.....It appears, therefore, that each judge has power to make regulations for his own court and that the regulations in different courts may vary according to the personal ideas of individual judges. It appears to me that this&apos; is undesirable and that all courts should be bound by and follow general rules, which should be made by a rule-making body. It is suggested that a rule-making body should be created, and that such a body might consist of The Chief Justice.A judge of the High Court.A legal officer to be appointed by the Governor.Rules made by the rule-making authority should be subject to the approval of the Governor.46. As regards the buildings of the court. The High Court court-premises are, as a whole, satisfactory, but the magistrates&apos; courts are inadequate. If, however, magistrates&apos; courts are transferred to the districts as suggested in paragraph 47, this would relieve pressure in the courts. I would recommend, however, that a new entrance be provided for the magistrates&apos; courts, next to the entrance to the superior courts. It is not suitable that so much traffic for inferior and superior courts should pass through one small entrance. If this new entrance is constructed, the opportunity should be taken of repairing the flag-stones of the entrance which badly need repair.47. In 1913 magisterial courts in country districts were abolished by Ordinance VII of 1913 and all magisterial courts were moved to Valletta. It appears that the Ordinance was enacted in pursuance of recommendations made by a local Commission of 1909, appointed to enquire into the working of Govern-ment Departments.In 1922 a magistrate was appointed to go on circuit to hold sittings in districts, but in 1926 the holding of sittings of magisterial courts in districts was again definitely abandoned.It is desirable that this question should again be considered. It seems to me that the establishment of a magistrates&apos; court in a large town or towns in the districts, with the increased jurisdiction proposed to be conferred, would have many advantages. It would prevent the great expense involved by the litigants or accused having to come to Valletta, and it would reduce the pressure on the courts in Valletta. The proposal I have in mind is that a permanent magistrates&quot; court should be built at Notabile, with a resident magistrate. No doubt, with the increased fees suggested, advocates would settle permanently at such town or towns, and justice would be more expeditiously administered there. This is a matter, however, upon which I do not feel at present in a position to make a recommendation, but I think that a small committee might be appointed to consider and report upon it.48. There has been criticism of the courts and advocates in this report, and I may be allowed to state that, when I was present, I found that the conduct of the courts was dignified, and that the advocates treated the judges with respect and each other with good manners.49. If it is decided to carry into effect the reforms recommended in this report, or any of them, the question may be raised whether the judges and advocates should be asked to express their views upon the reforms. Their negative views have been expressed at such great length that it seems as if they could say nothing more. If, however, it is thought necessary or desirable to do so, it might be sufficient to inquire whether they wish to add anything more in defence of the present system than is contained in the evidence before the Royal
Commission in 1931, and in the Remarks of the Advocates upon the Report of the Royal Commission in 1912. To state the reforms decided on before putting them into effect would be to open the floodgates of protest once more.Recommendations.50.   The following recommendations are therefore made :-(1) That Maltese be declared the language of the courts, with exception for English-speaking and Italian-speaking persons who do not know Maltese.(2) That the laws be enacted and published in Maltese and English only. (3) That the translation into Maltese of such laws as have not been translated into Maltese should forthwith be undertaken. (4) That Law XV of 1932 be brought into operation with certain amend-ments, save the provisions with reference to judges&apos; delegates, whichshould be deleted.(5) That provision should be made that, on the statements being filed as directed in Law XV of 1932, the issues should be determined by the court. That on the issues being determined, the case be set down for trial and tried to a conclusion, no adjournment being admissible, save in exceptional cases for reasons to be recorded by the judge.(6) That express provisions be made by law that no adjournments shall be granted solely on the ground that an advocate concerned in the case is engaged elsewhere, and that the trial of the case shall proceed when it is reached, unless it is shown that the advocate is unable to attend owing to illness.(7) That the jurisdiction of the magistrates&apos; court should be- increased as provided in Ordinance XV of 1932, and that the scale of fees should be increased.(8) That the Notarial Profession and Notarial Archives Act, 1927, be amended by declaring that Notarial Acts shall be written in the language agreed by the contracting parties, provided that such language is Known to the notary receiving the act. (9) That a rule-making body be established to make rules, in accordance with the law, governing the conduct of the courts.(10) That the question of the establishment of a magistrates&apos; court or courts in the districts, and the erection of the necessary buildings, be referred to a committee for consideration.(11) That a new entrance be provided to the courts at Valletta.(12) That the reforms decided on be forthwith brought into operation, without further discussion with the judiciary, the advocates, the local politicians, or the local press.ALISON RUSSELL, Legal Adviser.February 27, 1934.Enclosure III.H.H.,A REPORT by the Legal Adviser on the Maltese Courts of Law has been referred to me for my consideration and for my remarks.2. The report deals with the question of delays in the trial of actions, and, in connexion with these, suggests reforms : (a) In the language of the Courts; and (&amp;) In the procedure.3.   The delays in trials are unquestionably very serious, and it is generally acknowledged that an urgent remedy is essential.    I do not consider that these delays are to any appreciable extent affected by the language used in the trial. [10115] e 2
The evidence which is given in Maltese is dictated by the judge or magistrate in Italian, but the loss of time is negligible. It would, therefore, seem to be more appropriate to deal with the question of the language on its own merits, as a matter to itself.4. As regards the position of the language of the Courts, and the procedure now followed, the position is substantially as stated in paragraphs 12, 18, 19 of the Legal Adviser&apos;s report. With reference to paragraph 11, I am inclined to think that the list of jurors could be very considerably increased if more care were devoted to its compilation by the persons responsible. The list is revised annually, more as a matter of form, and I am in doubt as to whether any serious attempt at revision of the list is made.5. The lawyers as a class have always been averse to the use of Maltese in the Courts. They consider that the use of the Maltese language detracts from the solemnity of the procedure and lowers the standard of their profession. The standard of education in Malta has always been gauged by the ability of a person to speak fluently English or Italian, or both; Italian and English having been the language of culture for many generations, while the use of Maltese is restricted to ordinary daily intercourse. Maltese was only revived as a written language a few years ago, during which it has made considerable strides, but it is a fact that the educated classes find it difficult to read and are unable to write it correctly. Maltese has so far never formed part of the curriculum of the Secondary Schools, of the Lyceum or of the University. There are no books on law in the Maltese language, and the books to which reference is freely made by lawyers, are either in English, Italian or Erench (see report of Royal Commission 1931, page 136). There is no doubt, therefore, that the introduction of Maltese into the written proceedings without a period of preparation would in the transitory period cause confusion.6. On the other hand, it is very important not only that justice should be administered, but that the parties should know and feel that this is being done. For this reason it is unquestionable that it is in the interests of justice that the parties should, as far as it is practicable, understand and follow the proceedings, and this is still more important in criminal than in civil cases. A case before the Courts, is the case of the parties and not of the lawyers. A man who is being tried for his life or for his liberty, is entitled to know why he is being tried, and why he is condemned, and minor considerations should be set aside to attain this end.7. The Letters Patent of 1932 were a step in this direction, and they would have worked well and attained their object had they not been circumvented by the members of the legal profession. Experience has now shown that the existing provisions need strengthening; experience has also shown that it is possible to have criminal trials conducted in Maltese.8. The reason why the Letters Patent of 1932 did not have the desired effect is that, while the choice of the language was practically left to the defendants, the latter are generally discouraged to declare themselves Maltese-speaking persons, with the result that they make no declaration at all, and the proceedings are then held in the language of the courts, that is, in Italian.9. The Letters Patent do not refer to civil proceedings, but their provisions are restricted to criminal trials; distinction is also made between the written proceedings and the oral proceedings.10. As far as civil proceedings are concerned, I do not consider it a practical proposition to introduce Maltese either in the oral or in the written proceedings of the court. Civil cases invariably involve points of law, in many instances, of a very complicated character; the necessary legal phraseology is deficient in the Maltese language, or is not known by the professional classes; the civil laws have not been translated into Maltese; and the use of Maltese in civil trials would not appreciably help to attain the object of enabling the parties to follow the proceedings intelligibly, because the average litigant would still find it difficult to follow the intricate legal arguments on points of law. I am also in doubt as to whether any of the present or prospective members of the bench would be able to write a reasoned judgment involving a point of law in Maltese, particularly in the more elaborate cases.
11. The collection of judgments of the courts is invaluable for purposes of reference, particularly in cases where legal questions concerning matters of local character which find no parallel in other legislations are concerned, and if the judgments of the courts are to continue to serve as a guide for the interpretation of the law, it is desirable that nothing should be done to detract from their importance or to prevent their being drawn up as elaborately as possible.12. The same difficulties would not be encountered if English instead of Maltese were to be used as the language of the oral and written proceedings in civil cases, but then the obiect of enabling litigants to follow the proceedings would not be attained and the change would have a purely political significance.13. The use of Maltese in criminal cases, both in the oral and in the written proceedings, does not present the same difficulties. Criminal cases generally involve points of fact. The legal terms used to denote offences (often consisting in an adaptation of the Italian legal terms) are readily found in the language of daily intercourse, and the Criminal and Police laws have been translated into Maltese.Difficulties will no doubt be experienced, but not to the same extent as in Civil proceedings. In a trial by jury, before His Majesty&apos;s Criminal Court, the judge does not deliver a reasoned judgment. In the case of minor offences tried by a Magistrate, the sentence is generally a very matter-of-fact one.Some difficulties will be encountered in certain important cases, where a reasoned judgment is usually given, such as in cases of libel, and in cases which are brought before His Majesty&apos;s Criminal Court sitting as a Court of Criminal Appeal, but the percentage or these cases is small as compared with the total number of criminal cases coming before the Courts. Several criminal cases have already been tried in Maltese under the provisions of the Letters Patent. This shows that the reform is not impracticable. Magistrates and Court officials are, however, still unable to write Maltese correctly.14. The conclusion which may be drawn from the above consideration is that, while it is not practicable to use Maltese as the language of Civil proceedings, it is possible to do so in criminal trials. The result, however, would be that there would be two different official languages for different branches of the same Court of law.15. A less radical and, in my opinion, quite as efficient reform, which would fully attain the object in view as far as criminal trials are concerned, would be that whereby the oral proceedings are to be conducted in the language which is ascertained by the Court to be the language actually spoken and understood by the defendant, notwithstanding any contrary declaration made by the defendant, and notwithstanding the fact that the defendant makes no declaration at all; provided also that where the Court is satisfied that the defendant is an English-speaking person, the proceedings, both written and oral, are to be conducted in the English language.16. As regards the question of procedure, I am of opinion that the Maltese Code would serve its purpose without the necessity of any amendment if it is applied in the spirit in which it was framed, and if judges made better use of the discretion which must be necessarily left to them in any case. The slackness on the part of the lawyers, to which the Legal Adviser refers in his report, could, in my opinion, be very easily corrected by His Majesty&apos;s Judges.17. The law contemplates two methods of procedure, the one commenced by way of libel, and the other commenced by way of citation. In practice, fully 95 to 98 per cent, are now commenced by way of citation. The latter procedure is what is known as the &quot; summary &quot; procedure, but, as a matter of fact, it has been allowed to become as formal, if not more formal, than the other, the only informal part consisting in the way the case is introduced. After the introductory stage, no difference is now made between the two kinds of procedure, and written pleadings (&quot; note &quot;) are freely allowed by the Court to the lawyers, who often ask for leave to file them for no other reason than that of obtaining an adjournment within which to prepare their case, which they are supposed to have prepared before filing the citation.
18. The system of having 40 or 50 cases on the list for one-morning sittings is, to my mind, absurd, and is an obstacle to the termination of all.19. The attempt at reform contained in Ordinance XV of 1932 was more of an attempt to strengthen the hands of the judges and impress upon the lawyers the necessity of coming prepared with the case. I appreciate the objection of the Legal Adviser against the appointment of judge delegates to receive the evidence of the parties and of the other witnesses, and I am prepared to recommend the omission of the provisions from Ordinance XV of 1932. The Ordinance was fully discussed by a Parliamentary Committee appointed for the purpose, and I found that the concensus of opinion in that Committee was contrary to the appointment of delegates, and I feel bound to modify my opinion on the subject. The discussion in the Parliamentary Committee also bore out the necessity of certain minor adjustments which tend to accelerate the proceedings, into which, however, it is not necessary to enter into this memorandum.20. I do not think that any amendment is necessary to the Notarial Profession and Notarial Archives Act, 1927, because as the law now is, the choice of language is left to the parties, and there is nothing to prevent the parties from electing to have the contract executed in Maltese, English or Italian, as suggested by the Legal Adviser.21. In conclusion, I agree with the recommendations made by the Legal Adviser in his report in paragraph 50, Nos. 3 to 7, and Nos. 9 to 12. I also agree with recommendation No. 8, but do not consider any amendment of the law necessary.With regard to recommendations 1 and 2, I consider that it is practicable to introduce Maltese as the language of Criminal proceedings, but I would prefer the reform suggested in paragraph 14 of this memorandum, which, while being less radical, would attain the desired object of enabling the defendant to under-stand the proceedings.I regret being unable to agree that it is practicable, without a period of preparation in the schools and in the University, to use Maltese as the language of the civil proceedings.PH. PULLICINO,Treasury Counsel.April 2, 1934.Enclosure IV.Lieutenant-Governor,AS a result of the evidence which has been submitted and the discussions which have taken place on the subject of the language of the Courts, I have come to the following conclusions : I am of opinion 1. That Maltese should be the language of all Courts, both Superior and Inferior, for all criminal cases : Provided that where a person who is an English-speaking person is being tried the language of the Court should be English.The questions to be decided in a criminal case are nearly always questions of fact, and, accordingly, Maltese is the appropriate language in which to try the Maltese people.2. That Maltese should be the language of civil cases in the Magisterial Courts : Provided that where all parties are persons who are English-speaking persons the language should be English.I think that in civil cases before the Magisterial Courts, where the jurisdiction is now limited to  5 and. is proposed to be increased to  10. Maltese is an adequate language for the trial of such cases.3. That in the Superior Courts the language should be Maltese or English, as may be directed by the presiding Judge : Provided that where all parties are
persons who are English-speaking persons the language of the Court shall be English.There are many cases in the High Court, such, for example, as a case for the recovery of rent of  20, in which Maltese is an adequate language for the cases to be tried; but there are other cases involving technical questions of law, which it appears cannot at present be adequately discussed in Maltese. I therefore propose that it shall be left to the discretion of the presiding Judge to decide which is the appropriate language, Maltese or English, or both, in which the case should be tried and judgment delivered. No doubt in many cases the case will be tried partly in Maltese and partly in English.(Signed) ALISON RUSSELL,Legal A dviser.April 17, 1934.Subject to the remarks contained in my memorandum, a copy of which is attached, I agree that it is practicable that Maltese should be the language of all Courts of criminal jurisdiction, but would prefer the reform suggested in paragraph 15 of my memorandum.2. I also agree that Maltese could be used in civil cases in the Magisterial Courts, on the understanding that it will not be expected that Magistrates should write elaborate judgments.3. With regard to the Superior Courts of civil jurisdiction, it would be practicable to have English as the language of the proceedings, with the optional use of Maltese in the oral proceedings, a matter which might, as suggested, be left to the discretion of the Judge. I do not, however, recommend this course, as I consider that the language of the Superior Courts should be English and not Maltese if there is to be any change in the language of the Courts.(Signed) PH. PULLICINO,Treasury Counsel.April 17, 1934.
