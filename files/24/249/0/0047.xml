(THIS EOCUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )SECRET. CP.  160(34).Copy no.3 sG A 3 I  NET.PJRQP^SED LEGISIATION TO AMEND THE COLONIAL STOCK ACTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUERaI. In November, 1933,  the High Commissioner forthe Union of South Africa intimated that the Union Government proposed to repeal Section 65 of the South Africa Act,  1909, which provides for the exercise of the power of disallowance in respect of Union legislation. At the same time he put forward proposals for meeting a difficulty which, in the event of the repeal, would arise in connection with the maintenance of the trustee status of securities issued in this country hy the Union Government.2. This difficulty emerges from the terms of the thirdof the conditions prescribed hy the Treasury under the Col-onial Stock Act, 1900, which must be complied with in order to obtain trustee status.      This third condition is:-&quot;The Colonial Government shall place on record a formal expression of the opinion that any Colonial legislation which appears to the Imperial Government to alter any of the pro-visions affecting the stock to the injury of the Stockholder,  or to involve a departure from the original contract in regard to the Stock, would properly be disallowed.&quot;3. As indicated hy the Conference on the Operation ofDominion Legislation 1929 (Cmd.  3479), whose report was approved by the Imperial Conference, 1930, the present constitutional position is that in general the power of disallowance can no longer be exercised in relation to Dominion legislation and accordingly any Dominion possessing
the power to amend its Constitution in this respect can abolish the legal power of disallowance if it so desires. The Conference, however, recorded their opinion that where a Dominion Government had complied with the conditions prescribed by the Treasury under the Golonial Stock Act, 1900, and there was outstanding any stock which was a trustee security in consequence of such compliance, the right of disallowance in respect of such legislation ought to remain and could properly be    exercised. 4. It follows from this that the statutory repeal bythe Union Government of the power of disallowance, unless accompanied by other measures, would have deprived the Union Government of the power to issue new securities with the benefit of trustee status and would moreover have raised a question of grave difficulty as to the future position of existing South African securities which possess that status,  for a breach of contract with existing stockholders would have been committed.To meet these points the Union Government suggested that an agreement should be made between the two Govern-ments embodying undertakings to safeguard the position of stockholders in a form more consonant with the present constitutional position.      The formula which the Union Government proposed has been considerably amended in the course of discussions with the Treasury.      In the result it has been agreed that the interest of investors would be not less adequately guarded than under the existing arrangement by an undertaking in the following terms, to be ratified by the Union leg!slature;-The Union Government undertake that legislation   which appears to the&apos; United Kingdom Government either to amend Act No.  6 of 1913 to the injury of stock-holders or to involve a departure from
the original contract in regard      . *to the stock shall not oe sub-mitted for the Royal Assent ex-cept after agreement with theUnited Kingdom Government.Furthermore, if attention is drawn to such legislation alreadypassed by the Union Parliament,the Union Government will take thenecessary steps to ensure suchamendment as may be requested bythe United Kingdom Government,,5. This formula is satisfactory to me and the UnionGovernment have already proceeded on this basis.      Owing to the pressure of opinion they found it necessary to introduce in March a measure which (inter alia) repealed the power of disallowance as from a date to be proclaimed by the Governor General.      Recently they have introduced a- second measure to ratify the undertaking set out in paragraph 4.      This Bill will likewise take effect from a date to oe fixed by the Governor General.      The High Commissioner has assured me that it is the intention of the Union Government that both these Proclamations should be published simultaneously on a date to be agreed on after consultation with the United Kingdom Government. 6. The reason for this procedure (which has beenadopted at my request)  is that legislation will be necessary in this country to enable the undertaking of the Union Government to be accepted as an alternative form of compliance with the Colonial Stock Acts.      It is essential that continuity between the two forms of undertaking should be assured and the new procedure should, therefore, be brought into operation in the Union at the same time as legislation is passed in this country.7. The decision of the Union of South Africa to repeal the power of disallowance does not, of course,
impose on any other Dominion the obligation to depart from the existing position.      At the same time,  it seemed to me on the whole undesirable,  if it could he avoided,  that there should he alternative conditions applying concurrently to different Dominions in respect of stocks of the trustee class:    for one thing, stock-holders might possibly begin to examine their safeguards and discriminate between the different methods.      I thought it right,  therefore,  to approach the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand with a view to ascertaining whether they would think it desirable to adopt the new formula, a course which did not necessarily involve the formal repeal of the power of disallowance.      Each of these Governments, however, has replied that it prefers to adhere to the existing position under which legislation of this class remains formally subject to disallowance.      As to the other Dominions, the question is hardly pertinent to Newfoundland in the special circumstances of that Island at tne present time.      So far as the Irish Free State is concerned,  the position is that the Constitution does not contain any power of disallowance and the existing condition cannot therefore be complied with.      It is in the highest degree unlikely that they would seek to take advantage of the new arrangement;    nor, by doing so, could they secure the admission of their securities to the Trustee List as other Treasury conditions have to be complied with. 8. In the circumstances set out above it isnecessary to pass legislation in this country amend-ing the Colonial Stock Acts in such a way as to enable
an undertaking in the form agreed with the Union Government to be accepted as a compliance with the conditions pre-scrioed under the Colonial Stock Act.      I propose that this legislation should take the form of a short one clause Act providing that any Dominion may henceforth comply with the third Treasury condition either by the acceptance of the condition as it stands (see paragraph 2 of this Memorandum)  or by the passing of Dominion legislation ratifying an undertaking, in the form agreed with the Union of South Africa.      The two methods will have equal validity and each Dominion will choose which it prefers.9.     &quot;   As the Union Government has already introduced its legislation ratifying the undertaking,  it is most desirable,  in order that no disquiet may arise in the minds of Stockholders or of the public, that a Bill should be introduced in this country at the earliest possible date.      I am most anxious that it should be passed into law before the House rises, and I ask the authority of my colleagues to proceed accordingly. 10. I should add that in this matter the treasury have acted in consultation with the Dominions Office and the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, and that the Bill has been shown in draft to the High Gommissioners.(Intld. ) N.C.reasury Chambers, 11th June, 1934,
