3 DOCUMENT IS THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MaJESTY&apos;^ GOVERNMENT.SECRET.O.P. 129 (34).COPY NO.. O a B I N E T. Organisation of the Coal Industry,Memorandum hy the President of the Board of Trade.as a result of the report of the Coal Mines Re-organisation Commission (CMD.4468) which was presented to Parliament last December, an informal meeting was held with the prime Minister in the Chair, at which the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of Labour, the Secretary for Mines, and the Chairman of the Coal Mines Re-organisa-tlon Commission and I were present.After that meeting the Prime Minister directed that a Committee should be constituted to &quot;examine the possible courses open to the Government and all suggested methods of attempting to reorganise the industry, not excluding nationalisation of royalties or other forms of communal ownership of royalties.&quot;I have now received an Interim Report from this Committee, which I attach for the consideration of my colleagues.The report invites us to decide:(a) to adopt the policy of unification of royalties ae a useful progressive step which should increase efficiency in the industry and facilitate gradual concentration; and(b) to utilise the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission(whose duties are to &apos;further the reorganisation of the coal mining industry&apos;) as the body to which should be entrusted the administration of the royalties when acquired.This is the way favoured by the Committee to deal with the difficulties which have arisen in the working out of the policy laid down in Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, and to which reference is made in Sir Ernest Gower*s Report.    It can, I think,-1-
bo represented no progress on a moderate 3calo.I think it important that the royalties should &quot;be looked after by the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission, and not by a Department or by a separate body.     As regards a Department, Ministers must not be bombarded -with questions s.3 to the grant or the -withholding of particular leases, or os to the financial terms of such leases.      Tho objections to setting up another body to deal with one aspect of coal reorganisation when there is already one in existence dealing with another aspect of it are obvious.I hope that my colleagues will approve in principle, and authorise me to tell the Committee to proceed with the question of method, In consultation with the Departments concerned.      It should be possible to frame a scheme of purchase that would be self-supporting, involving no charge upon tho Exchequer.W.R.Board of Trade,5th May, 1934.

Myrddin Evans.Mr.  G.Hv Prycr.INTERIM REPORT.We were appointed in pursuance of a proposal by the Secretary for Mines that a Committee should be constituted to &quot;examine the possible courses open to the Government and all suggested methods of attempting to reorganise the industry not excluding nationalisation of royalties or other forms of communal ownership of royalties&quot;.We have interpreted the expression &quot;reorganisation&quot; as implying corporate planning of production, treatment and distribution with a view to the achievement of maximum economy by elimination of waste and concentration of effort.      tie understand that Ministers dealing with the coal mining industry felt that it would be impossible for the Government to accept responsibility for a policy which would result In a considerable increase within a short period of time in the numbers of unemployed miners.      We have considered the possible effect of reorganisation from this point of view and our conclusions .-1-
Vi fton this point are set out in Appendix I.     They may he summarised as follows.      It is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many men would in fact be thrown out of work by the adoption of a policy of concentration.     All that can be said is (a) that if the policy were acarried out to the fullest extent theoretically possible (a condition not realisable in practice) the number of men who might ultimately be displaced would not appear likely to exceed 100,000*, (bj that the total figure (whatever it may De) would only be reached gradually over a period of years, (c) that if the anticipated improvement in the industrial situation materialises the problem will be simplified, and (d) that if the process of displacement is gradual it can be dealt with to a considerable extent by arrangements for the transfer of labour, restrictions on recruitment and similar measures. Work sharing schemes might be helpful.These conclusions seem to indicate that while the effect of planned reorganisation on the unemployment problem cannot be foretold with accuracy, it is not likely, if the process is gradual, to be sufficiently serious to deter the Government from considering any measures which otherwise appear practicable and useful.It is at least doubtful whether planned reorganisation of the sort which is clearly desirable will proceed without some further stimulus.     At the same time it seems clear that any Government v/hich tried to force reorganisation upon the coal. *   As some men on the colliery books are also registered as temporarily stopped, any increase in. the number of unemployed, resulting directly from the displacement, would be less than the number &apos;displaced&apos;.
- cm-J&quot; ft8   3Industry &quot;by giving more drastic powers to the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission to compel the unwilling to amalgamate would meet with strenuous opposition in some important quarters on the ground that they were carrying bureaucratic interference with industry to excessive lengths, if not, indeed, attempting the impossible.      We recognise, moreover, the political difficulty which is inherent in the successful use of any direct powers to compel reorganisation:    it would be said that men were being thrown out of employment as a direct result of Government action.      On the other hand to do nothing - and still more to repeal Part II without putting anything in its place -would be represented in other important quarters as a weak and retrograde step.These considerations have led us, on the one hand, to refrain for the present from examining possible ways of taking more drastic action to compel concentration, and, on the other hand, to see whether some policy could not be found which would be a useful progressive step without being open to the same objections and dangers*The nationalisation of coal royalties, expressly mentioned in our Terms of Reference, clearly contains possibilities of this sort.     We have therefore examined them, a*id deal with the subject in Appendix II.      We consider that this policy would be helpful to the industry and financially sound.We think it important, in considering this matter, to keep two questions quite distinct.     One is whether the present system of royalty ownership is a real impediment to the industry&apos; so organising its production as to meet its present difficulties in the most effective way.     The second question is whether ownership of royalties by the State could be used to compel
recrganlsa tion.as regards the first question, while it is impossible to estimate the extent to which the present system impedes reorganisation, we think there can be no doubt that the unification of royalties must of necessity improve the position in this respect, leading as it would both to the removal of obstacles to reorganiSition and to the grant of facilities therefor.    Instances of the importance attached to this question by those in the industry, which have come to the notice of the Coal mines rceorganisution Commission, are mentioned in Appendix II. to this Report.As regards the second question, It could no doubt be argued that a uniquely effective weapon for Imposing compulsory amalgamations could be created by giving the authority that owned the royalties power to cancel pre-existing leases in order to compel amalgamations.    But we hesitate, for the reasons we have given, to recommend going as far as this* We do think, however, that it is worth considering some intermediate course, as for instances the recommendation of the Samuel Commission that a power of this sort might be given where a scheme favoured by the majority of the coal owners concerned was impeded by a minority, subject to the right of the minority to appeal to the Court,The unification of royalties would, in our opinion, be a useful progressive step which should encourage and facilitate gradual concentration and increased efficiency in the industry, and we recommend Its adoption.    The fact that its effect would be gradual means that it would be free from many of the disadvantages of other more drastic remedies, and It would not preclude the provision of other more direct power to
secure planned reorganisation if experience showed these to be necessary at a later date.When this subject has bean under consideration before, the experts have put iorward alternative proposals, one to acquire the rights in all coal simultaneously In one operation, the other to do it gradually over a long period.   We should like to go further into the question which of these is the better way, since both alternatives present formidable difficulties which need careful examination.Like those who have considered the subject before us, we think that the administration of the rights in coal, when acquired, should be entrusted to a statutory Board, and the existing Coal ralnes Reorganisation Commission,   whose duties are to  &quot;further the reorganisation of the coal mining industry seems a suitable body for the purpose.    But it is clear that three Government Departments - the Mines Department, the Treasury arid the Board of Inland Revenue - will be intimately concerned in the process of acquisition, and the question what should be the precise allocation of functions between them and the Royalties Board is also one that we should like to consider further in consultation with representatives of the two latter Departments *We have thought It well to present an Interim report containing the conclusions at which we have arrived and will now proceed to consider the two outstanding points referred to above.___n__(Signed) Ernest Brown,Chairman 25/4/54.x Sir Ernest Gowers wishes to make It clear that he must not be understood as expressing any opinion on this point.
In attempting to estimate the possible extent to which men now in employment in the coal mining industry might he displaced as a result of the concentration of production in the interests of efficiency, we started from the assumption that the output in the year 1933 could he taken as the minimum demand for coal.     This would appear to he justified by the fact that the second half of the year showed a definite improvement and that the effect of the Trade Agreements had not had time fully to show itself.If concentration had been carried out to the greatest possible theoretical extent and consequently the whole demand for coal satisfied by the smallest possible number of pits working full time, the number of men who would have been surplus in the winter quarters of 1933 would have been - on a purely arithmetical basis - about 130,000.This is nothing more, however, than an arithmetical figure. It would leave no margin for variation in the demand for different, classes of coal - no one can imagine anthracite pits being closed down because gas coal is available in Durham.Similarly, a margin must be allowed for the geographical factor.     A customer in Warwickshire will not be prepared to buy his coal from Scotland in the interests of conoentration of production.While we do not feel able to express in figures the effect of these factors on the number of men who may be said to be theoretically surplus to requirements, we are satisfied that the numbers must be substantial, and it appears to us,  thereforet that the maximum number of men who might ultimately be displaced if concentration were carried out to the fullest possible extent would not be likely to exceed 100,000.     In practice such a figure would probably never be reached and it certainly could not be reached for many years.     As indicated in a footnote to the Report, the increase in the unemployment figures would be less than the number di splaced.
APPENDIX IIThe character of the Royalties problem has entirely changed In recent years.      The broad question to which the Sankey Commission and the Acquisition ond Valuation of Land Committee (the &quot;Leslie Scott&apos; Committee) of 1919, addressed themselves was:      &quot;Does private ownership impede the fullest exploitation of our coal resources?&quot;     Thoy concerned themselves almost wholly with the question whether colliery companies were under difficulties in obtaining rights of working or ancillary rights, and only to a very small extent to the question whether the best technical &quot;lay out&quot; of the coal fields was affected.Both answered the main question in the affirmative, but, whilst the Sankey Commission prescribed nationalisation, the Leslie Scott Committee advised &quot;enabling&quot; legislation,The latter suggestion has been adopted, in a different form, by the Mines Working Facilities legislation, and many of the difficulties, and particularly those of acquisition of rights, have been met by those measures.The Samuel Commission, laying more emphasis on the general lay out, or plan of development, of the coal fields, came to the . conclusion that Working facilities legislation effecting &quot;partial alterations of the law and of individual rights, dealing with the difficulties in detail&quot;- did not and could not meet the case, and recommended nationalisation.More recently the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission have called attention to the question from a new angle.     The needs of the industry have fundamentally changed since the days of the Leslie Scott Committee.      The question is no longer whether private ownership impedes the fullest exploitation;    it is now whether it impedes rationalisation by selective workings And the Commission have little doubt that it does.     There is
evidence that the industry itself thinks so, and it is perhapsworth while to give one or two examples.The Mining Association were referring to this when, in thememorandum which they handed to the Commission on 15th March,1933, they expressed the opinion that &quot;the difficulties inconnection with mineral rights will prove an insuperableobstacle&quot;.     The South Yorkshire Coalowners who drew up a schemefor a holding company for the whole coalfield dealt at lengthwith the difficulty that private ownership of royaltiespresented, though they did not allow themselves to be &quot;baffledby it,.      &quot;Wo fully appreciate this handicap&quot; they said, &quot;butwe express the opinion that even if. it cannot be removed it isnot sufficient in itself to make concentration unprofitable&quot;.The eminent Mining Engineer, employed by the Commission toassist In the preparation of a provisional scheme of amalgamation for South West   Lancashire, stated in his report:-&quot;The benefits of merging from the point of view of working the collieries to the greatest economic advantage under any scheme or under any conditions, and particularly under a restrictive scheme&quot; (i,e,, Part I.) &quot;can only be realised if there Is the greatest amount of freedom to the Company working the coal in deciding whether and at what time any particular area or particular colliery shall be fully exploited or whether an   area or colliery shall be laid idle either on maintenance or abandoned for a considerable number of years.&quot;&quot;Under the existing- Leasehold conditions it is impossible to realise these advantages.      Certain rents are accumulating in areas which are not being broken when a colliery is laid idle, to mention only two of many Buch pointsP end it seems desirable that a merging of the iesBors&apos; interests should take place, with the merging of tho Colliery Companies.&quot;He then outlines the basis on which this might be done, and concludes&quot;Under this system the objections and restrictions which the numerous leases impose on the freedom of working would be removed.     Each lessor would get his proper proportion ...    I think it would be equitable end would be of advantage to the lessors as a whole,&quot;
The Chairman of the Amalgamated Anthracite Collieries Limited, has stated (privately) that in order to face competition with Russian Indo-Chinese and other anthracite cools Mb company must, inter alia, improve the quality of their cool;    that they have adequate quantities of first class coal available; hut that they cannot mine a sufficient quantity of it because under their leases they have to produce coal from collieries which produce only second and third rate ooals.      &quot;Obviously&quot;, he Bays, &quot;the right thing to do would be to shut down the collieries producing inferior qualities and concentrate on the best quality, but the expense of shutting collieries and paying dead rents and royalties is so heavy that we are forced to pursue a policy which we know to be uneconomic and detrimental to the export industry of the country&quot;.     The Working Facilities legislation cannot help.     The remedy is a consolidation of lessors&apos; interests, whereby the additional coal worked at the working collieries would make up and be set against the dead rents of the others.The difficulty can arise even within a single colliery. There is, for instance, a large South Yorkshire Colliery which holds its coal under numerous leases, each with a minimum rent for its own area.     The Company are now satisfied that in present conditions their most efficient and economical policy would be to concentrate their workings in a small number of areas.     From these they would raise a tonnage on which the royalty payments would greatly exceed the minimum rents attaching to them, but, as they would in addition have to pay about  11,000, by way of minimum rents on the other areas, it is a question whether they can afford to do otherwise than spread
their workings over as many minimum rent areas as possible and abandon the working policy which they are satisfied is, technically, the right one.    If the lessors1  interests were pooled, and a consolidated lease arranged, the Company could afford to undertake a consolidated minimum rent In excess of the present aggregate without handicap to the most -efiicient working of the property.The Mining association have recently had under consideration the incidence and effect of payments to royalty owners said have had a meeting with representatives of the royalty owners on the subject.    Nothing was said on that occasion about nationalisation but it is significant that both Lord Gainford and Sir Adam Hlmmo have since made public statements In favour of nationalisation.It might be sufiicient for the purpose if unification were achieved through the formation of statutory companies, whether of royalty owners or of colliery owners or of both, but the legislation that would be required would probably be no easier on that account and, indeed, would meet with opposition in quarters from which support for nationalisation could be relied upon.The measure ought to prove financially sound, Consolidation of leases and minimum rents, whilst facilitating rationalised production need not necessarily cause any loss of revenue (of. anthracite and South Yorkshire cases referred to above),    wioreover, with valuations on a basis of a net yield of about 8 per cent, and payment on a basis of Government credit, there must, so long as the latter remains anywhere near present level, be an ample margin even after allowing for loss of tax, and the provision of a sinking fund. The Sankey Commission   said, &quot;The transaction would probably leave the annual budget of the State but little affected.
There might be a profit of a comparatively small sum, or there might be a small loss, but the factor is not o.-ic of large importance.&quot;     But this was at a time when Government credit waE on a basis of little under 5 per cent.
