DOOUMENT  .IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.39COPY NO._(34)CABINET. UNITED KINGDOM-LITHUANIAN COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    The existing commercial relations between the United Kingdom and Lithuania are regulated by an Exchange of Notes of the 3th May, 1922, which provides for general most-favoured-nation treatment in matters of commerce and navigation.    The negotiations for a trade agreement were begun on the 2nd February, 1934, after a preliminary exchange of views had taken place in June lgSS.    Considerable delay occurred in reaching any substantial measure of agreement during the negotiations owing to the Lithuanian Delegations reluctance to make concessions to United Kingdom trade while the revised bacon quota allocation to Lithuania was under consideration. After this new allocation became known the Lithuanian Delegation still displayed reluctance to meet our requests. They were therefore informed of the minimum requests which we regarded as essential to enable an agreement to be concluded and were told that failing acceptance of these requests His Majesty1s Government would be compelled to denounce the modus vivsndi of 1922.     Some further discussions have since taken plaoe and the main lines of an agreement have now been provisionally settled.2. Lithuania, as the figures below indicate, is a small market but our herring trade to that country is important and our unfavourable balance of trade has afforded an opportunity of obtaining provisions for a substantial increase of United Kingdom exports to Lithuania.

Germany and the United Kingdom are the countries holding the most important shares in Lithuanian tra.de.    Of Lithuanian imports 10.8^ came in 1932 from the United Kingdom as compared with 40.3^ from Germany and in the same y;-ur 41.4-fo of Lithuanian exports went to the United Kingdom and 39?S to Germany.    In the year 1933 the position was modified in our favour in that 17;i of Lithuanian imports came from the United Kingdom whilst the German percentage fell to about 38fjj    the percentage of Lithuanian exports to the United Kingdom rose, however,  to 45^, while the percentage sent to Germany fell to 33^.    The increase in the United Kingdom&apos;s share of Lithuanian imports in 1933 is all the more noticeable because in 19T-1 it amounted to only 7.1$ as compared with 47/^ from Germany.     Lithuania has therefore in the last two years greatly increased her proportion of purchases from the United Kingdom.4. The principal exports from the United Kingdom to Lithuania in past years have been herrings, iron and steel manufactures, coal, cotton textiles and woollen goods. Facilities for increased trade or for the maintenance of existing trade have been obtained for these and other goods.   A more detailed summary of the principal concessions to be obtained in the agreement is given in the Annex to this memorandum.5. As regards the Colonies, tariff concessions or conventionalisations have been obtained for certain spices, raw
cocoa, tea, oranges and bananas, and lime juice.     The Colonies, will also benefit from the arrangement that Lithuanian import restrictions shall not operate in such a way as to prevent the full benefits of the tariff concessions from accruing to imports of these goods from the Colonies, and that, in general,  import restrictions will not be operated to the detriment of Colonial trade,,6. Part I of the Protocol contains a clause under which Lithuania undertakes to encourage the use of British shipping in United Kingdom-Lithuanian trade and to refrain from any action vrhich would prejudicially affect British shipping now engaged in that trade so long as existing freight rates and services are maintained.7. Lithuania secures that the Exchange of Notes of 1922 (which is subject to a three months&apos; denunciation period) cannot be denounced before October 1st, 1936, and must therefore continue at least until the end of 1956 (subject to a possible termination of the shipping provisions at short notice in the event of a general change of United Kingdom policy in regard to foreign shipping),     Lithuania also receives the usual assurance of most-favoured-nation treatment in the allocation of United Kingdom agricultural quotas in the same terms as have been given in the recent Scandinavian Agreements,  and in addition the Government of the United Kingdom undertake to endeavour for their part to secure that any regulation applies to imports into the United Kingdom of butter and other agricultural produce from Lithuania shall be effected by means of voluntary co-operation between the Government of the United Kingdom on the one hand and the Governments of supplying countries on the other hand. Stabilisation of certain United Kingdom import duties (mainly foodstuffs and timber) already conventionalised in the recent
Agreements with Scandinavian countries is also accorded. It is important to note that it has not been necessary to accord to Lithuania any reductions in the United Kingdom tariff,8. It is estimated that the effect of the undertakings in the Agreement which directly provide for increased imports of United Kingdom products into Lithuania should be an increase of about ,-3400,000 over the 1932 trade figures.      In addition, increased trade may be anticipated from the numerous tariff reductions which have been secured.      It may be said in this connexion that throughout 1933 and so far this year the Lithuania Government and business community have been making great efforts to increase imports from the United iangdom with the object of creating a favourable atmosphere for the commercial negotiations,9. I accordingly ask the authority of my colleagues to conclude a commercial agreement with Lithuania on the lines indicated in this memorandum and its Annex, the Agreement to run to the end of 1936, which is the date already-adopted for similar Agreements recently negotiated with other countries.Board of Trade,89 th June, 1934.
ANNEX.SUMMARY OP THE PRINCIPAL CONCESSIONS OBTAINED IN THE DRAFT ANGLO-LITHUANIAN COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT.(Rate of Exchange     31 Lits. g  1.).1; This note contains an estimate,  so far as possible, of the value of the concessions to be obtained from the proposed United Kingdom-Lithuanian Agreement, and also a summary of the provisions of the draft Agreement.2* Herrings.     In Lithuania there are no restrictions upon the import of herrings such as have damaged our trade with Estonia and Latvia, and we have secured an undertaking that the importation into Lithuania of United Kingdom herrings shall continue to remain free from all forms of restriction.      In addition we have obtained reductions in the duties from 12 lits. per barrel and 7.5 lits. per half barrel to 10 lits. per barrel and 5 lits. per half barrel. An undertaking has also been given that the sale in Lithuania of United Kingdom herrings shall take place under conditions of free and fair competition with other herrings.3, Coal and Coke.      The present duty of 7.5 lits. per ton on both coal and coke is to be reduced to 5 lits. per ton in the case of coal and to 4 lits. per ton in the case of coke.      In 1932 the United Kingdom supplied 77,000 tons of the total import of coal into Lithuania of 217,000 tons, i.e. , 36% and 4,000 tons of coke (or 18f,) of the total import into Lithuania of 22,000 tons.     In future, 80f. of the total Lithuanian imports of coal are to come from the United Kingdom with a guaranteed minimum quantity of 178,000 tons, while 50f;. of the total Lithuanian imports
of coke are to be supplied by the United Kingdom.     This concession provided for an increase in the trade over 1932 of about  70,000, representing employment for 400 men.4.    Ootton and Woollen G-oods.    The Lithuanian Delegation have pointed out that the Lithuanian customs duties on cotton and woollen textiles are of considerable importance to Lithuania for revenue purposes and that since the United Kingdom has previously supplied only a relatively small proportion of Lithuanian total imports of ootton and woollen textiles, any substantial duty reductions would involve a severe loss of revenue to Lithuania, while the resulting trade advantage would accrue, in the main, to supplying countries other than the United Kingdom.      The Lithuanian Delegation therefore suggested a series of purchase arrangements covering cotton and woollen goods from the United Kingdom, and we have secured satisfactory arrangements for the purchase of the following quantities of goods from the United Kingdom.(a) Cotton Yarn. Not less than 5Q/o of the total annual importation into Lithuania with a minimum of 800 tons.(b) Cotton Thread. Not less than 50fo of the total annual importation into Lithuania with a minimum of 60 tons.(c) Cotton Piece Goods. Not less than 40/o of thetotal annual importation into Lithuania with a minimum of 300 tons.(d) Woollen and Worsted Yarn.    Not less than 6Q&amp;of the &quot;total snnual&quot;&quot;importation into Lithuania with a minimum of 150 tons.(e) Woollen Cloth. Not less than 25fr of the total annual importation into Lithuania with a minimum of 40 tons.These concessions are embodied in a confidential letter.It is estimated that they represent an increase in tradeover 1932 of approximately  200,000.-6-\\A
In addition, certain duty reductions have heen secured on items of special interest to United Kingdom trade (e.g., on wide cotton prints and artificial silk mixtures) and in other cases provision is made for the conventionalisation of the existing duties.5*    Purchase Agreements for other goods. In addition to the purchase arrangements for cotton and woollen textiles, satisfactory purchase agreements have been made for iron and steel, supplies for the woodworking industries, cement, sugar, jute, salt and saltpetre.     The value of these concessions over 1932 trade may be estimated at  120,000. The Lithuanian Government also undertake to issue import licences for and freely to permit the sale of superphosphates from the United Kingdom to an amount not less than 20,000 tons per annum and, in addition, an assurance has been secured that should the system of import restrictions in Lithuania be abolished, a quantity of not less than 12,000 tons of superphosphates per annum shall be obtained from the United Kingdom.      In addition an assurance has been obtained that the various Lithuanian State Purchasing Departments shall be instructed, when making purchases from abroad, to endeavour to satisfy their requirements as far as possible from the United Kingdom.6*    Tariff Concessions. In addition to the reduced duties secured for coal and coke, herrings and textiles, provision is made for the duties on a large number of items either to be reduced or conventionalised.     Reductions of duty cover sauces and pickles, tyres and inner tubes, sheet iron, gramophones., motor cars and motor cycles.     iilxisting duties will be conventionalised on, inter alia, superphos-phates, cement, and cotton and wool yarns.     For Colonial
goods reductions have been   obtained in respect of oranges, bananas, lime juice, pepper and pimento, and conventionalisation of existing duties for cardamoms and nutmegs, cloves, cinnamon and ginger,  cocoa and tea.It is not possible to estimate the increased trade likely to result from these concessions as this will depend upon the use which trades will make of them.7. Import  ^Restrictions.   Our requests for undertakings designed to protect United Kingdom trade from the harmful effect of import restrictions have been adequately met. These include an undertaking to grant sufficient licences for purchase arrangement goods;   a provision that restrictions shall not be operated to prevent the full benefits of tariff concessions from accruing to United Kingdom or Colonial goods;   and an undertaking that, in the operation of any import restrictions,  the Lithuanian Government will have regard to the desirability of increasing the sale in Lithuania of United Kingdom goods.     It is also provided that, in general, the Lithuanian Government will not operate such restrictions to the detriment of Colonial trade.8. Trade Balance.   A. satisfactory clause has been agreed under which Lithuania recognises that the sales in Lithuania of United Kingdom goods should be increased.9. 3xchange.     Provision has been made (in a confidential letter) that,  in the event of the Lithuanian Government being compelled to introduce foreign exchange restrictions, sterling exchange will be granted at due date for Lithuanian purchases of United Kingdom goods and for petroleum and petroleum products invoiced in sterling and imported into Lithuania by United Kingdom traders, and for payments due to United Kingdom shipping interests.     This is a necessary safeguard to ensure the advantages of the other concessions.
10.   Commercial Travellers.     A provision has been secured under which commercial travellers who visit Lithuania on behalf of United Kingdom companies and firms will be accorded the same treatment as is enjoyed in Lithuania by Lithuanian travellers.I1&apos;      Shipping.    The Lithuanian Government agree to encourage the increased utilization of British shipping services in the United Kingdom-Lithuanian trade and to take no action which would affect prejudicially any British shipping company now engaged in the trade between the two countries so long as the company maintains existing freight rates and services.      In the event of any substantial changes being made in the freight rates charged or the services offered, the Lithuanian Government will, before taking action, consult with the Government of the United Kingdom.     Provision is aiade in the Agreement for the termination at short notice of the shipping clauses of the Exchange of Notes of 1922 in the event of a change in our policy in regard to the treatment of foreign shipping.
