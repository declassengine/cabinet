INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation hy the Government of India, dated 13th May, 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cahinet by the Secretary of State for India.
4 0 confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 13th May 1934,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.At a Conference held in Eanchi,  at the beginning of May,  the Swaraj Party was formally constituted.      Shortly before the meeting an announcement was made of the decision of the Governor-General not to prolong the life of the present Assembly after the Session in August next.       The new party, therefore, will have opportunity by the end of the year of testing its strength in the country.    The most significant points in the resolutions of the conference are the following:(a) The new party will be autonomous and will control its own administration and funds,  but will be subject to the control of Congress in all broad issues of national policy. Congress members alone are eligible for full membership, but others can be associate members.      This appears to be a middle course between two extremes, those who would have liked to unite in one party all the constitutional Nationalists and those who consider that the party should be only a branch of the Congress organisation and under strictest control.       The decision makes it clear that Liberals will not join the new party.(b) The programme adopted is not unlike the resolution passed at the Karachi Congress of 1931, but in some respects more moderate and less definite.       The repeal of repressive legislation and the release of all political prisoners and detenus,  including those connected with the Bengal terrorist movement, form the first item.    The policy in regard to constructive measures of social and economic reform is only expressed in vague general terms and is not satisfactory to the left wing of Congress which is advancing a so-called socialist programme based largely on ideas of
communism.( c)    The resolution on constitution recommends the rejection of the White Paper proposals as &quot;being considered, as a whole,  not only a negation of the national demands made hy Mr.Gandhi on behalf of Congress at the second Round Table Conference, but also calculated to perpetuate political subjection and economic exploitation of the Indian people.The Conference claims for India the right of self-determination and is of the opinion that the only method of applying that principle is to convene the Constituent Assembly of representatives of all sections of Indian people to frame an acceptable constitution.       The resolution concludes;&quot;The consideration of acceptance or rejection of the mode and proportion of representation as contained in the Communal Award is premature at this stage and the time for considering the same will arrive when the Constituent Assembly is convened&quot;.Tho attempt to shelve consideration of the Communal Award and thus avoid rousing antagonism of Nationalist Muslims has met with serious criticism from many Hindu quarters, and particularly from Hindu Mahasabha.       The resolution as a whole shows that the party has no constructive solution for the constitutional problem and will concentrate on the easier task of criticism.The meeting of the All-India Congress Committee will take place at Patna shortly when the main questions will be the ratification of Mr* Gandhi&apos;s statement regarding civil disobedience and the endorsement of the Swaraj Party&apos;s status and programme.       There is likely to be considerable discussion on both points.After a period of intensive propaganda, the General Strike Committee in Bombay launched what was intended to be a
general strike of textile workers on April 23rd.      In accordance with the general policy of allowing the utmost possible freedom of labour movements consistent with the requirements of public safety and peace, the Government of Bombay placed no obstacles in the way of the proposed strike. At first, the result was small and the fact that on the first day only four mills,  employing about 5,000 operatives, were closed showed there was, at the outset, no general inclination on the part of the workers to support the strike.It was not until two days later that the strike assumed large proportions; in the meantime processions had been active in the mill areas; there had been numerous breaches of the peace and some attacks on the police when engaged in protecting loyal workers;  a number of assaults were made on individual workers and secret intimidation was actively practised by picketing workers at- their quarters.     Action was taken to regulate routes of processions and places of meetings, but inflammatory speeches continued to be delivered and these speeches had their natural consequences in further acts of violence.      Leaflets were distributed and speeches wore delivered urging the strikers to concentrate on remaining working mills in order to make the strike complete by May 1st and it was suggested that other workers, such as railway and tramway employees in Bombay, should join in the demonstrations.It became clear that strike was being conducted not with a view to settlement but with apparent object of spreading and intensifying disturbed conditions.      The main organisers of tho strike were professed Communists and it became necessary for Government of Bombay to arrest them.       This action appears to have caused some improvement in the situation;  assaults are less frequent and very little intimidation is being practised, but there are still only
19 mills working and 33 are closed, and the Strike Committee have recently put forward a list of 20 demands some of which are not in any way connected with any legitimate textile dispute. The Government of Bombay have made itclear that they have   no intention of placing restriction on the functioning of bona-fide trade unions.      Before strike commenced they had instituted an expert fact-finding enquiry into the effect of cuts in wages and generally into conditions of textile industry in Presidency. Theexperience of the last few weeks however shows that, as in 1927-28,  it is not a difficult matter for communist agitators to stir up uneducated and illiterate workers, especially at a time when economic conditions are such as to create feeling of discontent in industry.       Strikes have also occurred in textile mills in Delhi and Nagpur under similar influences.In recent reports it had been possible to chronicle some improvement in the terrorist situation in Bengal. But two outrages within a very few days, the first,  the throwing of bomb into a police station near Calcutta, the second,  the attempt to assassinate the Governor of Bengal at Darjeeling, are a plain reminder to the public,  if reminder were necessary, that the movement is still active and is only kept in check by the ceaseless counter-measures of the authorities.     Nevertheless, there have been recently growing signs of some consolidation of Hindu public opinion in Bengal against terrorism.       An important statement was issued within the last month by some Hindu leaders in Bengal condemning terrorism strongly both on moral and political grounds.       It is possible that this movement may be assisted by the shock to public opinion given by the attempt on the life of the Governor.
