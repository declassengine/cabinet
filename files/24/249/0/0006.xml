C0NI&apos;&apos;IDEH TIA L. A.0.293.BOAfuj OF TR/iU&amp; aDVISORY COUNCIL.STaTE OF TRtDE    -*   MARCH, 1934.-4Summary of Reports, submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council ^Supplemented&apos;in Bome&quot;&quot;cases with, statistical informationEMPLOYMENT.    The total number of persons on the registers ofEmployment Exchanges in Great Britain at 19th March was2,201,577 a decrease of 116,332 as compared with 19th February.The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by88,057, and the number temporarily stopped by 28,275.The changes between 19th February and 19th March in thedifferent Divisions were:London.........* .23,201South Eastern....12,595 South Western....10,639Midlands.........19,281North Eastern....17,762 North. Western....18,917Scotland.........10,374Wales............3,563The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 19th March, was 10,058,000, being 117,000 more than a month before and 644,000 more than a year before.The improvement during the month was most marked in building and public works contracting, artificial stone and cement manufacture, the clothing trades, iron and steel, tinplate and metal goods manufacture, engineering and ironfounding, vehicle building, shipbuilding and ship-repairing, most of the textile industries, printing and bookbinding, furniture manufacture, the distributive trades, the hotel, boarding house and transport services, and laundries, dyeing and dry cleaning.Employment declined slightly in the wool textile and hosiery industries, textile &quot;bleaching and dyeing, leather tanning and wallpaper manufacture.
OVERSEAS TRAjDE.     Imports in March were  62.0 m, and exports  33.0 m,, compared with  56.3 m. and  32.5 m. respectively in March, 1933.    Of the increase of  5.7 m. in imports  4.1 m. were in raw materials, including  0.7 m. for cotton and 0.6 m. each for timber and rubber.    Exports of imported merchandise were  5.6 m. as against  4.0 m, in March, 1933.    The excess of imports over total exports of merchandise amounted to  23.3 m. as compared with  19.8 m.RAIL AMD ROAD TRAFFIC.   During the five weeks ended 1st April the railway traffic receipts were  1,145,000 (8,87%) more than in the corresponding period of 1933, and for the thirteen weeks ended April 1st the increase was  2,572,000 (7.91*5).    The percentage increases in the various classes of traffic were:-5 weeks ended     13 weeks ended 1st April 1st AprilPassenger Traffic ........ 10.80 5.38Me rchandi se, Mine ralsand Livestock......... 6.3 12.04Goal, Coke and Patent Fuel. 9.61 6,04The comparison is affected, however, by the fact that last year Good Friday fell on the 14th April, and this year on the 30th March.In January the number of passengers (excluding season ticket holders) conveyed on railways (other than those of the London Passenger Transport Board and the Whitechapel and Bow Joint Railway) was 12.7,i more than in January 1933. Journeys at standard fares were 12.4% less, but journeys at reduced fares, except workmen&apos;s, were 18.2/i more and journeys at workmen&apos;s fares were 15.3$ more.For the four weeks ended   January 27th freight tonnage was
2d12.6/t more than in the corresponding period of 1933;  the biggest increases were in minerals and merchandise (-t- 38%) and in other merchandise (15.2%)*    For the calendar month of January the following increases over 1933 quantities are recorded:  iron and steel 58.6$, iron ore 58.5%, bricks 55.4a, pig iron 52.1?b, limestone for blast furnaces 61.0;;?, timber- f19.1%.The number of motor vehicles other than motor cycles newly r^gistajred,. in February was 21,368 being an increase of 8,300 (63.5/. over February., --1933.    The increase comprised 5,846 private cars .and 2,454 goods and other vehicles.Registrations of rnctbr cycles increased by 685 (37.0V-)-1FINANCE AND BANKING,    (l) United Kingdom.      The principal exchanges werexousually steady during March,    bince the end of the month, however, sterling has appreciated as a result in part of the good revenue returns, while the dollar has weakened owing probably to the inflationary sentiment again evident in Congress,    The latest returns indicate that there nas been little slackening in the additions to the stocks of gold held in London though they mostly represent gold hoarded for account of foreigners.    The Stock Exchange was active until the middle of March,   when quieter conditions set in. tfith the deterioration of the transfer position German loans fell sharply.    Gilt-edged Securities rose.    On April 5th the Government made an issue of  150 m. of a new 3% Funding Loan, part of the proceeds of which will be used to repay  105 m. of 4$ bonds maturing in April.Provincial Bank cle-arings have been rising for some months&quot; past and the March figures are nearly 9% over March of last year.   London Clearing Banks&apos; Advances, after falling since early in 1931 increased by  7,3 m. in February, and a further  11 m. in March, and the discount market is handling a noticeably larger volume of trade and bank bills.     An
I&apos;.finteresting development is the registration of Credit for Industry Ltdc which will specialise in the provision of long term finance for small and medium sized businesses which have in the past experienced difficulty in raising fresh long-term capital.(2)   France.    The Government has published Decree Laws cutting expenditure on salaries and pensions of Government Servants and on subsidies and credits to various Departments by frs- 2,760 m.    As M. Doumergue had no power to increase taxation, and no other items of public expenditure could provide sufficient economies, this was the only solution, and, although there is some threat of a civil servants&apos; strike on May 1st,  there is   now a greater feeling of confidence.    The balance of the frs* 4,000 m-deficit is to be made up principally by a voluntary cut in pensions to ex-soldiers,    For immediate purposes the Government have borrowed G. 100 m. from Dutch bankers at 4% for one yvi ir.(3) Germany.      The adverse trade returns will probably lead to further restrictions in transfers in the near future.    The gold and devisen cover for the note issue has now fallen to the nominal figure of 6.7%.    Steps are being taken to restrict imports of raw materials as far as practicable and contracts for the importation of certain goods, such as wool, cotton, flax, jute and raw silk are to be prohibited until Hay 5th, when control of such imports will be in the hands of Commissions appointed by the Government.    Violent price fluctuations are not, however, anticipated.
A law of March 23rd provides that if, in respect of a financial year ending on any date before 1st January, 1935, a company distributes a higher dividend than for the previous year and the dividend thus distributed exceeds 6 per cent.,,, It must invest an amount corresponding to such excess over 6 per cent, in Government or Municipal Bonds,     The objects of this law are to curb dividend distributions by firms benefiting by special trade conditions (e,g. Government employment programmes), and to support the bond market with a view to debt conversion.     Meanwhile this measure and the control of imports have caused a sharp fall in the index of share prices,(4) United States of America.    Owing to lack of opportunities for spending and the time necessary to complete preliminary arrangements it seems improbable that the final budget deficit will exceed $4,000 m.      It is likely that much of the money which should be spent^ this fiscal year will stand over till next year and therefore the two year deficit may reach the Presidents estimate of $10,000 m.During February &quot;business recovery continued and the higher level was maintained in March,OPAL -   The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 24th March was 4,629,000 tons, compared with 4,346,000 tons a year ago and production appears to &quot;be gradually expanding.     The average number of persons employed -during this period was 786,400 as against 788,100 a year before, and the average weekly output per person was 5.89 tons, compared with 5,51 tons.     Exports in the first quarter of 1934 showed a slight reduction at 9,313,000- tons as compared with 9,438,000 tons in 1933,      Home consumption in February was 4$ higher than a year previously,IRON AND 3TEBL - The market was more active in March;      i domestic demand   is still mainly responsible for the
increased business as the export demand remains disappointing. The number of furnaces in blast further increased.     Foundry pig-iron is particularly in good demand as the light castings Industry is benefiting from the improvement in the building tradec.     Business in semi-finished material continues to be brisk though Continental oroducers are reported to be quoting appreciably lover prices in the United Kingdom market than elsewhere.      There has been some expansion in the domestic demand for finished steel products;    the export market is still depressed though some increase in foreign enquiries is reported.The output of pig iron for the month of March 1934 was 503,600 tons as compared with 332,200 tons in the corresponding month of 1933, and with an average of 427,500 tons for the first two months    of 19340     The output of steel ingots and castings amounted to 829,700 tons in Kerch 1934 as compared with 707,500 tons in February,  and 577,700 tons in March 1933.In Scotland the steel making plant is now estimated to be working at upwards of 60/i of capacity, an improvement largely attributable to the increased activity of the Clyde shipyards.     The smaller shipyards urgently need new orders, and it is hoped that some will result from the enquiries now on the market.      The export trade is dull.On the North Last Coast  the usual holiday stoppage had to &quot;be curtailed owing to pressure for deliveries,,     The demand for semi-finiched steel is tending to outrun current supply; bueinecs in small bars is brisk and more orders have been received from the structural trades.     The domestic trade in sections,  rails and 3heets has been more active, but orders from the shipbuilding yards and for the export trade are disappointingly fev0      There is some anticipation of orders being obtained from Russia.
in Sheffield production and employment arc still at a high level, due almost entirely to the expansion in home demand. The export trade, particularly in locomotives, railway wagons and carriages, remains depressed.     Tool makers are &quot;busy and the cutlery Industry is more active.     Business in forgings is good and there is a slight increase in marine work.     The demand for stainless steels is pressing upon the supply.In South Vales trade is steady on the whole.     The demand for sheet and tlnplate bars is more active and Continental competition is small.     In epite of keon competition more orders have &quot;been obtained in the tinplate industry, but no improvement is indicated in the depressed galvanised sheets industry.     Home demand for heavy finished steel products is fairly good, but the export trade is still depressed.ENGINEERING.     The general improvement shown since December was maintained in March.      Several large contracts have &quot;been placed, particularly for railway material and machine tools.    Since the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement important orders have been given to British firms and further orders are expected.     New private shipbuilding work has been commenced, particularly on the Clyde, and should, with the Admiralty contracts, cause steady improvement.     There is a better tendency in heavy oloctrical plant and in textile machinery particularly for export, where business with Holland, Egypt, Finland and Brazil has improved.     Employment in the engineering industry has &quot;beon maintained or has improved in all districts.MACHINE T00L3 - Demand continues active, although as regards the heavier industries business comes forward somewhat slowly. In the foreign trade the general position is still unsatisfactory owing to restrictions on imports and exchange difficulties. Exports to Russia aro now showing an increase every month as seme of the orders placed since the signing of the trade agreement arc &quot;beginning to be shipped.      It is anticipated that considerable orders may be placed by Russia in the near future.
COTTON -   The seasonal decline in trade which becomes apparent in March has this year been more than normal.     The American section (which agreed to a week&apos;s stoppage to avoid accumulation of stocks) 7/worked at        and the Egyptian section at 75., of capacity, as against 76?s and 82$ respectively in February.      The curtailment in the American section has helped to keep up margins, and prices are more remunerative than a year ago.     Cloth prices are little higher than a year ago in epite of the advance in cotton, and yarn prices and weaving margins are bad, due largely to the chaotic conditions regarding wage rates.Deliveries, however, of raw cotton to the mills for the first quarter of 1934 averaged 20.4 million lbs. per week, compared with 19.3 million lbs. a year ago.WOOL -   There is evi&amp;enoe of a further decline in the general activity of the industry during March, although at this period of the year there is normally   a seasonal advance,.     The worsted section appears to have been chiefly affected.     The present indications do not warrant any anticipation that the decline will be arrested in the near future, although general activity is of course considerably higher than it was a year ago;     the decline is due apparently to the higher prices of wool tending to restrict demand, and ; is more felt in the worsted section than in the woollen, owing to demand turning to the cheaper grades.Exports both in March and for the March quarter showed an increase an the corresponding periods of 1933.     Exports of tops and yarns in March increased over those of February, but on the other hand there was a decline in the exports of tissues,.     Raw wool prices showed a slight decline, but they are still 72$ higher than those current 12 months ago.
*5 OSILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Retained imports of real silk piece goods continue to increase, particularly from Japan.     Home production of rayon yam continues to advance very satisfactorily,, but increasing quantities of viscose crepe yarn are being imported.      Business in Macclesfield was rather better in February than in January, partly in consequence of the additional duties on French silks. Competition from Continental countries is severe in the tie silk section, especially in mixture cloths.kOTOR INDUSTRY.      Bales of passenger and commercial vehicles in the United Kingdom remain very satisfactory. Serious competition is expected to result from the United States of America campaign both overseas and in the British market.      The trade with Spain is rendered difficult by the continued delay of the Spanish government in extending the benefit of the rebate of Customs duty to United Kingdom cars. As the Turkish Government has not fixed a quota for motor cars for the period April to September, no importation is possible and orders have been cancelled.LIGHTER M7JTAL TRADES.      Metal windows should be in good&apos; demand with State development and general housing on the increase, although there is a dearth of orders for large city buildings.     The demand for cheap bazaar cutlery has decreased and the trade in medium qualities has improved;    production in Sheffield and February exports were both higher than last year.      The tool trade is busy and the present low prices should soon rise.     There is a shortage of skilled workers in the metal smallwares industry which may cause difficulties if trade improves;    at present it is only fair in spite of the absence of foreign competition.     Conditions in the needle industry   and the fishing tackle trade are very satisfactory and foreign business in the latter is improving.     Foreign
competition is again making itself felt in enamelled hollow-ware since the reduction in the import duty, and prices are low.     Recently increased demands from the engineering and hardware trades have made conditions in the foundyy industry &quot;better than they were a year ago.     The metallic bedstead trade continues to fall off, the annual turnover now being only  300,000 as against  1 million in 1926.     Competition is severe but efforts are being made to form an Association for the regulation of prices.     Prospects in the lock and allied trades are good, although Japanese competition is being encountered and Canada is a new competitor in this market.     The architectural metalwork industry is very depressed owing to the curtailment in the construction of large municipal and commercial buildings;     demand has fallen by over 40$ in the last two years and the intensified competition has reduced prices by 20$.     There are slight signs, however, of improvement and it is hoped to form an Association to eliminate undue competition.     The press and sheet-metalwork industry in the Midlands is extremely busy owing to the demands of the motor trade.     Of the non-ferrous metals tin has been dearer, probably owing to restriction of out-put, but copper has tended to be cheaper.     Lead and zinc have been featureless.CHEMICALS.      Both in the home and export markets trade in alkalis and heavy chemicals for tht; first quarter showed a satisfactory increase over the average rate for 1933.     The demand for coal tar products, except for creosote oil, has not been as active as hitherto;    refined coal tar is seasonally active but not to the extent expected.      Sales of dyestuffs (except alizarine and indigo) continue to exceed the figures for the corresponding -period of 1933.     The market for fertilizers remains active;   pharmaceutical products were in better demand;    and wood distillation products, except wood tar and wood creosote, found a ready sale.
SOAP * OIL AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      The demand for soap continues steady.     The slight rise in butter prices was not sufficient appreciably to improve the margarine market; deliveries for the first quarter of 1934 are l3;o less than in the same quarter last year.      The demand for edible oils and fats improved slightly.     The trade in raw materials for the first quarter of the year was 5$ better than a year ago, though most of the increase was registered in January.ELECTRICITY.      During March 1,390 million units were produced, as compared with 1,162 million in March, 1933, and the increase in output this year over the first three months of 1933 is 16.9$.     The percentage of productive capacity employed in the electrical industry was 55f3, being some       less than in February.     The index number of orders received for heavy plant was 58 (1920 ^ 100)  as compared with 64 in March, 1933, orders for the home market were lower, and for the export market higher than a year ago.     As regards light apparatus, exports in February showed some increase over the corresponding period of 1933 and the home market is also expanding.PAPER.      There was a definite increase in the demand for newsprint;   prices, however, are low in spite of the greater cost of raw materials and competition from overseas is severe. Business in wrapping papers has been poor especially in kraft compared with the first quarter ol 1933.     Deliveries of fine writing and speciality papers were better than a year ago. Printing papers were in better demand in March, but sales were below those of a year ago.    In the paper boards section the improvement noted earlier in the year has been maintained, but imports of strawboards from Holland have increased in recent months, probably in anticipation of a higher duty.
The Sulphite Pulp Convention, which oovers practically all European supplies, announced early in March an increase of 5/- per ton in the price of sulphite pulp.     The M.G. Sulphite paper makers will be severely affected, especially as the price of M.G. Sulphite paper ha3 recently fallen heavily.     In view of the drought in Scandinavia and Finland the shortage in mechanical pulp   is likely to continue for some time.RUBBER   -   In nearly all sections the home demand is satisfactory.     Export business, however, remains difficult. Japanese competition is felt overseas in rubber thread and footwear, and the domestic market for footwear is seriously disturbed by imports from Singapore and Hong Kong at prices substantially the same as those ruling before the imposition of the last additional duties.     There is keen competition from Canada In mechanicals and in soles and heels.BUILDING   -   Employment in the industry showed an improvement which is expected to continue.    Public works and contracting have not improved relatively as much as building but the Treasury decision to reduce rates of interest to Local Authorities should help matters.   All centres report    increased activity.     Prices of raw materials are firm and supplies are adequate.RETAIL TRADE    -   The value of sales in February was 3$ greater than in February, 1933.   This Is the fifth consecutive monthly increase.    The principal improvements were in furniture  (12.2$), hardware (7.1/6)   jnen&apos;a and boys1 wear  [6*5%), sports and travel goods  (5.2%), and in the food section (7.4$) and perishables  (6.9$).   There were decreases in boots and shoes, piece goods, and In sweets and tobacco.     Stocks in February 3howed an Increase of 1.3$. The Improvement was spread over the whole country, but the South of England and suburban London had the largest
percentage increases.     Every district showed an improvement in the food departments and all districts (exoept Scotland) in the non-food Department.     The preliminary figures for March suggest a more pronounced upward trend than in FebruarySHIPPING   -   The index number of shipping freights (1913 ss 100) for March was 78.03, as compared with 81.24 in February and 75.81 a year ago.The number of vessels under construction in Great Britain and Ireland at the end of March was 107, of 481,400 tons gross, compared with 90 vessels, of 331,500 tons, on December 31st and with 68, of 252,400 tons, at the end of March last year.   At the end of March the tonnage on whioh work was suspended amounted to 145,000 representing 139,000 tons of steam shipping and 6,000 tons of motor shipping.     These figures include the Ounard Liner of 73,000 tons, on which work has since been restarted.     The tonnage now being built largely represent vessels of special types, notably llner3 and oil tankers and does not include any naval construction.     The tonnage of motor shipping under construction at the end of Maroh was 175,600.During the last three months work was begun on 203,000 tons, an increase of 128,000 tons on the total for the December quarter.EMPIRE.OANADIAN TRADE   -   The index of wholesale prices advanced In February by 1.5$ and was the highest since April, 1931, the gain In the last twelve months being 13$. The maladjustment between the prices of farm products and of general commodities has to some extent been corrected by the rise in the prices of farm products by 35$ during the same period.     Stock prioes also gained 6% on the January index. The business activity index, after seasonal adjustment, was
KJ   i86.4 in February compared with 86,8 in January, and 67-0 in February 1933.     The index of manufacturing activity was 83.2 compared with 8007 In January.   Exports of zinc and silver increased considerably but exports of nickel and copper were not so heavy.     Wheat flour production and the meat packing and sugar manufacturing industries also showed improvement on January.     The iron and steel and paper and construction industries showed some deoline.     Railway oarIoading3 and receipts for the first 9 weeks of the year are some 20$ above those for the same period of 1933.Total imports in February were ^33,600,000, showing a small increase over January and a considerable improvement over February 1933.     Exports  (exclusive of gold bullion) were ^38,400,000 compared with ^47,100,000 in January.AUSTRALIAN TRADE    -   From July 1st,  19 33, to the end of February, 1934, 2,404,506 bales of wool were received Into store0     Of these, 2,164,591 have been disposed of. Up to the end of March wheat exports for the season were 24,435,158 bushels, and flour exports 194,285 tons o   Butter shipments this season were over 4*000 tons lower than last ye^r.     The export value of rabbits and rabbit skins for the seven months ended 31st Deoember last was S979,883 against  735,938 in 1932.    The value  (in Australian currency) of imports of merchandise in February was  6,029,759 or  569,360 more than in February,  1933.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE. -   The improvement recorded since the middle of 1933 continues to be maintained.   Gold mining continues to expand, the January output being 907*641 fine ounces valued at  5,854,284, which is the highest revenue yet recorded for any month.     The return of the U.G.A, to a modified form of gold bullion standard has further improved the outlook.   Diamond mining, however, remains at a low ebb. The building   trade is entering upon a boom period especially
along the Reef and the motor trade is flourishing, while most other manufacturing industriesy except engineering at the coastal tovmsj report steady progress.    Agricultural prospects are bright,  though locusts are causing considerable damage in certain limited areas, - Sowings of maize have been heavy.   The fruit export season in the Western Provinces has begun and heavy supplies are coming forward.    Export pricesa however, are reported to be on the low side.Exports  (other than gold) amounted to , 2,360r000 in January^ 1934, as compared with  2,060,000 a year earlier aSpIZ.1^ AMERICA-,ARGENTINA   -    The export surplus for January and February was some 123 million paper pesos as against some 56 million In .the same months of 1933.    The British share of imports for the same periods was 25.5$ and 19*4$ respectively, the U-S.A. coming second so far this year with 14-6$, probably as a result of the fall in the dollarc United States competition is specially notioeable in maohiner; and motor-cars4    Wheat prices have been easier and shipments lower than last year.     Maize has been firm;    the estimate for the orop is 5*8 million tons, compared with SB7 million In 1933*    With the indications that the rise in prices was restricting consumption the wool market was dull.   Butter, exports have declined, but exports of hides are the best f or s ome t irae .The Government have arranged to pay off the balances outstanding amounting to about  1 m. of the   Buenos Aires Water Supply and Drainage Works Five per cent, loan of 1892 and of the Five per cent. Port of Buenos Aires debentures.The position of the British public utility companies in regard to exchange ha3 improved.   Reports of the intention to make a &quot;de jure&quot; revaluation of the peso are denied.
BRAZIL. The Japanese Mission to Argentina has now arrived in Brazil and is reported to be prepared to consider buying all the cotton Brazil produces, in return for markets for Japanese cotton goods.     The total trade between Brazil and Japan rose from  116,000 for the whole of 1931 to  164,000 in the first 9 months of 1933,  the advance being mainly in imports into Brazil.     Brazil&apos;s export surplus in January was  1,548,000 (gold), against  1,443,000 in January, 1933.      Imports were down by 20?,,     The coffee market is dull but, in spite of the increase in stocks, the position is said to be good. Agreement has been reached with Prance on the French credits in arrear and the Franco-Brazilian tariff war Is thus ended.     As regards current credits, Brazil has further undertaken to give French exporters foreign exchange to the value of 3Cfi of French imports from Brazil.     Foreign Public Utility companies are concerned at the Governments arbitrary voidance of contracts to pay in gold or specie.CHILE. The economic position, though it still causes anxiety, shows indications of gradual improvement.     The export surplus in 1933 amounted to 186,500,000 pesos of 6d,  (gold), compared with 76,700,000 in 1932,      Practically all imports were down, except foodbtuffs, yarns and chemicals.     Copper exports increased by 20fj and nitrates by some 75%o     The production of gold is increasing and is considerably helping the foreign exchange position.     A commercial treaty has been signed with Peru providing for reciprocal tariff reductions, notably on Peruvian sugar and Chilean wheat.      Negotiations are proceeding with oolumbia,PERU, The export surplus in 1933 was 154 million tjoles, compared with 107 million in 1932.    The latest returns continue to reflect a marked improvement.     The exchange market is difficult, depending almost entirely on the amount cf cotton bills on offer.
