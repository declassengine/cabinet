THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1934.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 172 (34).CABINET.JAPANESE COMPETITION-IMPOSITION OF TEXTILE QUOTAS in ceylon.FOLLOWING on the discussion with my colleagues in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 27th June (Cabinet 26 (34), Item 11), I now circulate, in a convenient and collective form, the telegrams which have passed between the Governor of Ceylon and myself relative to the question of the introduction of the quota legislation.2. It is clear that Ministers, even if they are prepared to introduce it, will not support the necessary legislation, and that there is no prospect whatever of its acceptance by the State Council. In the circumstances, it will have to be carried by the exercise of our overriding powers. As at present advised, I think that the balance of advantage lies in our proceeding by an Order-in-Council here, empowering the Governor to impose the necessary restrictions.memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Initialled)P. C.-L.Colonial Office, Downinq Street, July 2, 1934.[10239]B
ANNEX.(1)Telegram from the Governor, Ceylon, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 26th June, 1934. (Received 10-37 a.m. 26th June, 1934.)No. 117.   Immediate.Ministers have fully considered terms of your telegram No. 92 and force Of Opposition in the Council which has developed since Quota proposals have been discussed publicly and in the press. . They are of opinion that there is no prospect whatever of acceptance by the Council of those proposals in present economic conditions, in view of inevitable additional burden on the poorer classes already suffering severely from extraordinary fall in price of cocoanut products. They accordingly suggest for your consideration, as an alternative to the Quota System, the removal of existing duties on Empire, textiles (thus affording a preference of 10 per cent., combined with a cash bounty of 10 per cent, from Ceylon revenue, to importers of United Kingdom textiles. Ministers sincerely anxious to do everything practicable to assist British trade, and deeply regret necessity for seeking alternative to your proposals, in view of certainty of rejection by Council involving destruction of Ministers&apos; authority and serious political crisis..    / (2)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Ceylon.(Sent 8-30 p.m. 27th June, 1934.)No. 97.   Secret.Your telegram No. 117,I recognise difficulties of Ministers and appreciate spirit in which alternative suggestion of preference is put forward. At the same time, I am advised that average import value of Japanese textiles was about 2d. per yard in 1933, and that this figure is so much below that at which United Kingdom can compete that preference of 20 per cent, would be practically useless for the purpose in view. Board of Trade consider that a specific preference of about 3d. per yard according to categories would be required to achieve same purpose as quota. It was for this reason that I felt that a quota system which would enable import of very considerable quantities of Japanese goods at low duty would be preferable and more acceptable to consumers than a duty. On the other hand, if your Ministers can see their way to impose preference of order I have suggested, I should naturally not object to this alternative. As I have already stated, we are proceeding with our inquiries into the possibility of a duty on soya beans.There is one further difficulty in your suggestion to which I should draw attention. Idea seems to be that half preference would be granted by bounty applying to United Kingdom goods only. As a result of Clare Lees-Mody agreement between British and Indian textile industries and negotiations which are now proceeding between Governments of United Kingdom and India, we are committed, to doing our best to secure for Indian cotton goods in the Colonies treatment as favourable as that accorded to United Kingdom cotton goods. I fear that; negotiations. with India would be imperilled if we agreed to any scheme placing Indian textiles in less favourable position than United Kingdom textiles.in the Ceylon market, i    Private an,cl Personal telegram follows.
Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 10-20 p.m. 27th June, 1934.)Private and personal.Your telegram of 26th June, No. 117, and private and personal telegram were considered by Cabinet this morning. Prom telegram No. 97 you will see that on scale proposed preference would be quite ineffective for its purpose, and it was considered by Cabinet that it would be quite impossible to abandon the position that, if necessary by exercise of paramount power, effective legislation must be carried in Ceylon. Possible consequences were appreciated by Cabinet when they took their original decision, but to acquiesce in refusal of Ceylon to pass effective legislation would mean that an impossible situation would be created both in this country and in all Colonies where the same legislation has been passed and where the same arguments that Ministers have advanced can be used from the consumers&apos; point of view. Moreover, quota legislation has been carried by exercise of official majority in some Colonies, e.g., Straits Settlements. As we have always felt that it would be a great advantage if the measure which we have to certify was proposed in first instance by Ministers, Cabinet agreed that, although in their opinion less satisfactory, they would be willing to proceed by effective tariff preference rather than quota, provided duties on an effective scale were proposed by Ministers. Manner in which you are handling this situation is appreciated by all, and I know that you will do your best to get Ministers to agree. I realise, however, that their agreement to effective proposals is very unlikely. Should Ministers refuse to introduce and support effective preference we should then be driven to introduction of quota legislation under provisions of Article 22 of Order in Council. So far as you can give it, I should like your personal fore-cast of effect on Ministers and Council of such certification. . Do you think that they will offer passive opposition as far as they can or that they will refuse to carry on and resign ? Do you anticipate that we shall have to take over whole administration under plan provided for in Orders in Council, of which drafts were enclosed in my secret despatch of 30th June, 1933? Would you anticipate any attempt at disorder in that event ?Resort to Order in Council is a possibility which we have always realised it may be necessary to face on this issue.(4)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 28th June. 1934.(Received 7-48 p.m. 28th June, 1934.)Immediate.  Private and Personal.I presume I may communicate substance of your secret telegram 97 and such part of your private and personal telegram as seems advisable to vice-Chairman. Board of Ministers, whom I am trying to arrange to see on Saturday. I shall then be better able to give a forecast. I am convinced there is no chance of Ministers agreeing to introduce quota legislation, and I fear there is no hope that theyNWill propose preference of such a size as you mention. Ministers are, I am certain, absolutely sincere in their wish to help, but there is no question that poorest classes will be badly hit, and they dare not face popular indignation.. I believe, from what they said to me last week, that Ministers would not greatly object to matter being settled over their heads by Order in Council. State Council will rage furiously, but I doubt whether they will go further than words.. Attempt at disorder is not likely in my opinion. What I should expect would be that in the future Council would obstruct every proposal thought to be [10239] b 2
favoured by His Majesty&apos;s Government and make itself generally. unpleasant, and that popular feeling would express itself in a boycott of British textiles and possibly other goods.In my opinion, quota system would result in some gain to India, but otherwise would really effect no appreciable good as the poorer classes simply cannot afford to buy British textiles.(5)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Ceylon.(Sent 12 noon, 30th June, 1934.)Immediate. Private and Personal. Your Private and Personal telegram of 28th June.Your appreciation of the prospects has been noted. I am attracted by the suggestion contained in your telegram that if, as anticipated, Ministers refuse to introduce quota legislation or satisfactory preferences, we should proceed by issue of Order-in-Council here rather than by certification under Article 22. By such procedure, prior discussion in State Council, with consequent delay and exacerbation of feeling, would be averted, and it would not appear to raise constitutional issue in so acute form as would be done by use of your reserve powers. I propose, therefore, to bring the matter again before the Cabinet on Wednesday, 4th July, and to seek their approval of an Order-in-Council being issued, empowering you to make Regulations limiting and controlling the import of textiles from foreign countries. Detailed provisions would not be enacted in Order-in-Council, and it is contemplated that you should lay them down in general form of draft Ordinance; but I would telegraph further about the form of the Order.   Please telegraph any comments on this plan by Tuesday.You may communicate to Ministers substance of my telegram No. 97, but you should not communicate details of private and personal correspondence, especially because that had reference to a procedure rather different from that we now propose to follow, and because there may be definite advantages in presenting Ministers and Council with a fait accompli without giving warning of our proposals. Substance of that part of my Private and Personal telegram of 27th June, dealing with reasons which make it impossible for me to acquiesce in refusal of Ceylon Government to pass effective legislation may, however, be communicated to Ministers.(6)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 30th June, 1934.Private and Personal.Vice-Chairman and I have had frank discussion. Substance of your telegram No. 97 will be laid before the Minister as a matter of form, but he agrees with me that any such scale of duties is impossible.I told him that quota system must be introduced. We discussed alternatives of introduction of legislation by Ministers or imposition of quota by Order in Council.He would prefer former course for constitutional reasons, and if the Ministry explain that it is done as an alternative to Order in Council, it may be possible to adopt it. It is a question of tactics, and he will secretly consult important Ministers and report to me, probably next Saturday.
(7)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 1st July, 1934.Private and Personal.Your telegram of the 30th June and my telegram of the same date have crossed. I like your suggestion personally, but advise that result of Vice-Chairman&apos;s sounding of Ministers should be awaited. It would in any case be disastrous to issue Order in Council before the Budget is passed.I did not quote your private and personal telegrams. Vice-Chairman is under the impression that the suggestion to proceed by Order in Council was my own brain-wave.(8)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the governor of Ceylon.(Sent 7 p.m. 2nd July, 1934.) Private and Personal.Your telegram of the 30th June and your telegram of the 1st July. There would, I think, be obvious advantages in proceeding by Order in Council. There is no question that power to pass Law imposing quota is possessed by His Majesty in Council, and that exception could not be taken to exercise of such power in a matter of Imperial concern. No delay would be involved. Procedure under Article 22 of the State Council Order in Council, on the other hand, appears to give opportunity for obstruction at every stage and to give opportunity for attack on constitutional grounds. It appears, therefore, that an Order in Council would be much the best method, both on practical and on constitutional grounds.To give me the necessary facts on which to take a final decision when and how we should proceed, I shall be glad of information on the following points : (a) What is the present rate of importation of Japanese textiles ?   How nearare they to exhausting the proposed quota ?(b) By what date will the Budget be passed ?(c) How long would it take to pass the Quota Bill if introduced by ministers and carried by means of the Governor&apos;s reserve powers? Would it not be possible for the Council at every stage to obstruct its passage 1 Might we not in the end be forced, after long delay, to resort to procedure by means of Order in Council, owing to the fact that the State Council refused to form a quorum or the Speaker declined to co-operate ?Colonial Office Vote will be taken on Friday, and in the Dehate I expect I shall be asked what the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government are, and I shall be compelled to reply that, unless necessary action is taken by Ministers, object will be secured by exceptional measures. Everything is to be gained in that event by using the powers which are most effective for our purpose.oHe is very emphatic that until Budget which will shortly be introduced is passed nothing should be done in the matter by either method. I am in complete agreement with him. As he correctly says, it does not matter what after that the Council does, but it is quite likely that they will throw out the Budget if action is taken now.
