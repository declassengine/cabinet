IT ft DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.3RET. [p. 130 (54)COPY NO.&quot;81-CABINET.JAPANESE TRADE CaiPETITION. Interview with the Japanese Ambassador. Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade,In accordance with tho decision reached at our meeting on the 25th April (Cabinet 17 (34), Conclusion 1.) I asked the Japanese Ambassador to come to see me yesterday (i:oy 3rd) and handed to him the note of which I attach a copy.The Ambassador enquired whether I could give him some further explanation regarding the &quot;action of a general character&quot; which we are to take in the Colonies.     I explained to him that we wore in communication with the Governors of the Colonies with a view to introducing a system of quotas applicable to-foreign cotton and rayon goods generally, and that these quotas would apply as from May 7th - the date on which I intended to make public the Government1s policy. His Excellency was given an assurance that except in the case of the West African Colonies the quotas would apply to foreign countries generally and would be based on the proportion of the import trade in the various Colonies during a basic period. As far as !J&apos;est Africa was concerned, I reminded him that nearly a year ago vre had found it necessary to give notice of withdrawal from tho Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of our four Vest African Colonies in view of certain other international obligations in respect of those Colonies.      In the case of West Africa, therefore, we should bsve to apply quotas only to Japanese textiles.The Ambasftodor then referred to his memorandum of the 31st March, and said that in that memorandum his Government-1-
had indicated their willingness to consider any proposal which His Majesty&apos;8 Government might feel able to put forward.     He gathered, however, that we had nothing to suggest.     I pointed out to him that when I saw him in the middle of March I had indicated that we expected a proposal from their side.     The Ambassador said that he appreciated the position;   he then asked whether he was right in assuming from the lest paragraph of the memorandum handed to him that the proposals for action in the Colonies were open to alteration if a counter-proposal was put forward by his Government. I said that his Government would appreciate that, in view of the great lapse of time since this subject hod first come up, the necessity of protecting our commercial interests would not allow us to delay longer in taking action, but that if his Government put forward any proposals the whole situation would most certainly be considered in the light of those proposals and in tho light of the, action which we had already been forced to take.The Ambassador asked whether the quotas were to be temporary or permanent, and I once again assured him that whilst it was necessary for us to take action at once, that action was being taken in no unfriendly spirit, and was not discriminatory (except in West Africa) against Japan.     We were certainly open to receive any counter-proposals from his Government.On the question of the silk duties I explained that theproposed action was not on ell fours with the action to be taken inthe Colonies.     Whilst it was true that we had suspended the revision of the silk duties in order to provide a favourableatmosphere for the industrial discussions, the new duties wouldcertainly not be aimed especially at Japan.     As he was alreadyaware, there were several anomalies in the silk duties and it was urgently necessary that these should be set right as soon aspossible.     Moreover, the suspension of the silk duties was causingua great embarrassment in our commercial relations, with France,and, to a certain extent, with Italy.The Ambassador said that he recognised the importance of the whole subject and said that he would report to hio Government immediately.V R.of Trade, h lay, 1034. d
MEMORANDUM HANDED TO THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR,Following the reception of the memorandum which was handed to Sir Horace V/ilson on the 31st March last, H.M. Government have most carefully reviewed the situation in the light of the exchanges of views which have taken place during the last 12 months between the Governments and the industrialists of the two countries.It is a matter of satisfaction to H.M. Government (who share to the full the desire of the Japanese Government that the traditional friendship between the two countries should not be prejudiced in any way)    that the long drawn-out discussions between the delegates of the textile industries have been conducted throughout in a completely friendly atmosphere.      It was with the greatest regret that HoM. Government learned that the   delegates had been unable to translate that mutual goodwill into an agreement.     They still hoped, however,  that the Japanese Government would in their turn be able to make proposals towards a co-operative solution of the problem.     The memorandum from the-Japanese Government of 31st March, however, does not appear to indicate that they are in a position to make any such proposals.ELM- Government have therefore reluctantly come to the conclusion that the continuation of negotiations in existing circumstances is not likely to lead to any fruitful result and that they would not be justified in refraining any longer from taking such steps as they may deem necessary to safeguard the position of British trade.     They wish to make it clear that these steps, which do not include the denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, will not be taken in any unfriendly spirit towards Japnn but solely in order to protect the vital commercial interests of this country.
The- actionTrtiich-Jrt jLs now proposed to take in the Colonial Empii-e will he of a general character, except in the case of West Africa where special measures will he required by reason of the existence of treaty obligations to other Powers.As regards the United Kingdom market, the Japanese Government will be aware that the question of a revision of the silk duties has been under consideration since May, 1932, and that this review was suspended in August of last year in order to ensure the most favourable possible atmosphere for the industrial discussions.     In suspending this review H.M. Government were subjected to very severe criticism in Great Britain and the Japanese Government will appreciate that in present circumstances it is not possible for H.M. Government to justify further delay in making this revision.Finally, H.M. Government desire to emphasise that, while they must now resume their liberty of action, they will at any time be ready to give the most careful consideration to any proposals which the Japanese Government may desire to put forward towards the solution by mutual agreement of this difficult problem.3rd May, 1934.
