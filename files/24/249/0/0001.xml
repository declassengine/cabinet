The negotiations for a trade agreement with Estonia   areInow sufficiently advanced to enable me to submit a summary of the results to my colleagues.    The negotiations were begun on the 11th December, 1933, and had as their object the replacement   j by a wider Commercial Agreement of the temporary Agreement of 15th July, 1933, which re-established our herring trade with Estonia and provided in return for guarantees as to the treatment j of Estonian exports of agricultural produce to the United Kingdom.j2,   Estonia, as the figures below indicate, is a small market but our herring trade to that country is important and our unfavourable balance of trade has afforded an opportunity of obtaining an increase of other United Kingdom exports to Estonia.
o3.    Germany and the United Kingdom are the countries holding the most important shares in Estonian trade.    Of Estonian imports 13.5 per cent came in 1932 from the United Kingdom as compared with 32 per cent, from Germany, and in the same year 37 per cent, of Estonian exports went to the United Kingdom and 26 per cent, to Germany.    In the year 1933 the position was    I modified in our favour in that 18 per cent, of Estonian imports came from the United Kingdom whilst the German percentage fell to 22.    The percentage of Estonian Exports to the United Kingdom was the same as in 1932 (i.e. 37 per cent.) and to Germany 21 per cent-    The increase in the United Kingdom^ share of Estonia&apos;s imports in 1933 is all the more noticeable because in 1931 it amounted only to 7.7 per cent, as compared with 30 per cent, from Germany.    Estonia has therefore in the last two years very greatly increased her purchases of United Kingdom goods4.    The principal exports to Estonia from the United Kingdom in past years have been herrings, iron and steel manufactures, coal, cotton textiles, woollen goods, and sugar,    Facilities for increased trade or for the maintenance of existing trade have been obtained for these and other items of trade.   A more detailed summary of the principal concessions obtained in the Agreement is given in the Annex to this memorandum,5. As regards the Colonies, tariff reductions or conventionalisations have been obtained for certain spices, raw cocoa, tea, and copra and palm kernels.    The Colonies will also benefit from the arrangements (l) that Estonian import restrictions shall not operate so as to prevent the full benefits of tariff concessions, (2) that imports will not be restricted below the 1933 level, and (3) that if Estonia decides to impose new import restrictions there shall be consultation between the tv/o Governments with a view to steps being taken to ensure that the restrictions do not render inoperative the undertakings as to imports in the year 1933.
6.    Part I of the Protocol contains an unusual clause under which Estonia undertakes to refrain from any action which would prejudicially affect existing British shipping in United Kingdom - Estonian trade and to encourage the use of British shipping in that trade.    A confidential assurance has &quot;been given that Estonia will encourage the use of British shipping in all Estonian trade.   Provision is also made in the Agreement itself for the termination of the shipping provisions of the Commercial Treaty of 1926 at short notice in the event of a general change of policy in regard to foreign shipping.7.   Estonia secures that the Commercial Treaty of 1926 (which is subject to a 15 month&apos;s denunciation period during the currency of the Herring Agreement, now in force, but to be superseded by the proposed Commercial Agreement) cannot be denounced before April 1st, 1936, and must therefore run at least until April 1st, 1937 (subject to the shipping provisions referred to in paragraph 6 above).    Estonia also received the usual assurances of most-favoured-nation treatment in the allocation of United Kingdom agricultural quotas in the same terms as have been given in the recent Scandinavian Agreements, and in addition the Government of the United Kingdom undertake to do their best to see, when allocations of butter imports are being decided (in the event, of course, of a restriction on butter imports being operated whether voluntarily or compulsorily) that due weight is given to the special importance of the butter trade to Estonia and the extent to which it may have been affected by restrictions in other markets.    Stabilisation cf certain United Kingdom import duties (mainly foodstuffs and timber) already conventionalised in the recent Agreements with Scandinavian countries is accorded and in addition there are new conventionalisations of the present United Kingdom import duties of 80 per cent, ad valorem on chair-backs and seats of plywood and of 10 per cent, ad valorem on a small range of
cassia products - articles which interest Estonia particularly. It is estimated that the monetary effect of the undertakings in the Agreement which directly provide for increased imports will be an increase over 1952 in United Kingdom exports to Estonia of about  240,000 and over 1933 of about half that amount.    In addition some increase of trade may be anticipated from the numerous tariff reductions which have been secured.    It may be said, in this connection, that throughout 1933 the Estonian Government and business community were making great efforts to increase imports from the United Kingdom with the object of creating a favourable atmosphere for commercial negotiations.8.    I accordingly ask for the authority of my colleagues to conclude a Commercial Agreement with Estonia on the lines indicated in this memorandum and its   Annex, the Agreement to run until the end of 1936, which is the date already adopted for similar Agreements recently negotiated with other countries.W.R,Board of Trade, 20th April, 1934.
ANNEX. 1 summary of the Principal Concessions obtained in the Draft Anglo-Estonian Commercial Agreement.(Rate of Exchange:    18 Ekr. ^   1).1.    This note contains an estimate so far as possible, of the value of the concessions to be obtained from the proposed Ahglo-Sstpnian Agreement, and also a summary of the provisions of the draft Agreement.      In the estimates of values comparison is made with the year 1932 os temporary concessions were obtained from Estonia during 1933 in anticipation of the Agreement now under consideration.2.    Herrings.     The duty reduction from 0.07 to 0.022 Skr. per kgs. gross and the unrestricted entry of United Kingdom herrings into Estonia under conditions of free and fair competition with Estonian herrings, which was obtained in the Temporary Herring Agreement of 1933, is confirmed.     A new provision has also been obtained precluding unfair tariff discrimination on the basis of size (such as has damaged our herring trade with Poland, in favour of Norwegian herrings). British herrings were almost totally excluded from the Estonain market in 1932.     In 1931 Estonia imported from the United Kingdom about 3,000 tons of herrings and in 1930 about 6,000 tons. If the average value of the herring imports for those years is taken the concession is worth about 1,250,000 Ekr.  ( 69,000), since in 1932 no British herrings wont to Estonia.Coal and Coke.     The present duties are 10 Ekr. a ton on both cotil and coke with 75 per cent, reduction on coal for shipping .-uid industry.     Tho duty on coal other than &quot;Smithy Peas&quot; is to be reduced to 2.50 Ekr. a ton, and &quot;Smithy Peas&quot; and coke for industrial use are to be duty free.      In 1932 the United Kingdom supplied 30,200 tons of tho total import of
4 o JL w48,000 tons of coal into Estonia, and no coke.     In future 85 per cent, of the total Estonian imports of coal are to come from the United Kingdom with a guaranteed minimum quantity of 35,000 tons (the amount imported from the United Kingdom in 1931) and no difficulties are to &quot;be placed in the way of the admission of 5,000 tons of &quot;Smithy Peas&quot;;   under a confidential arrangement 2,000 tons of coke are to he admitted.      The value of this concession may he put at about 119,000 Ekr. ( 6,600) additional to 1932 trade.3.    Cotton and Woollen Goods.    Cotton and woollen textiles have been the most difficult items in the negotiations as Estonia has old established cotton and wool industries which are important both politically and economically to that country.      The Estonian delegation have pointed out that Estonia has lost through the restrictions and high duties imposed by other countries its export trade in cotton and woollen goods, which, in the case of cotton, far exceeded its imports of cotton goods.     Any importation to which Estonia might agree would be at the expense of the Estonian industry. Any quota which Estonia gives to the United Kingdom will Involve giving quotas of several times the amount of the United Kingdom quota, to other countries which have most-favoured-nation rights in Estonia.     Despite these objections quotas of 50 tons of cotton piece goods and 20 tons of wool piece goods have been obtained with provision for upward revision in the event of an improvement in the trade in Estonian cottons or woollens;    these concessions are embodied in a confidential letter.      The figures compare with am import from the United Kingdom in 1932 of 10 tons of cotton piece goods and 2-g- tons of wool piece goods.      In addition an undertaking to purchase 60 per cent, of all imports of 30ol yarn from the United Kingdom has been obtained.     The estimated values (in addition to 1932 trade) of these
concessions are:-Cotton piece goods554,000 Ekr. 30,500Wool piece goods454,000 Ekr. 25,200Wool yarn1,280,000 Ekr, 71,2002,288,000 Ekr. 126,900.Substantial duty reductions have been obtained on the cotton items of special interest to the United Kingdom, andthe classification has been modified to favour imports of1United Kingdom specialities.     The duty on wool yarn has been conventionalised.      It was not possible to secure reductions of the duties on wool piece goods;    it was pointed out by the Estonian Delegation that these duties had not been increased during the past 11 years.      Conventionalisations of existing duties have, however, been secured.4.    Purchase Agreements.     Satisfactory purchase arrange-ments have been made with regard to iron and steel, jute wrappers and cloth, salt, saltpetre, motor vehicles, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical products, agricultural, dairy and road making machinery, wool, supplies for woodworking industries and cotton thread.     An assurance is being given that if any imports of wheat flour into Estonia are necessary in the future the United Kingdom will be regared as a source of supply.      The value of these concessions (over 1932 traded &apos; may be estimated at 692,000 Ekr.    ( 38,000) without taking   -account of the trade in motor vehicles and agricultural machinery the value of which cannot be assessed.5.    Tariff Concessions.      In addition to the reduced duties secured for coal and coke, cotton piece goods, and herrings mentioned above and the conventionalisation of duties on wool piece goods, provision has been made for the duties on a large number of items either to be reduced or conventionalised. Reductions of duty cover whisky and gin, salt, photographic plates, galvanised sheets, slide fasteners, motor cycles, side cars, motor cars, cycle chains, waxed cloth, linoleum,
artificial silk goods, mixed fabrics of cotton and wool or artificial silk, mustard, pickles, metal polishes, varnishes, boot blacking, files, gramophones and records,, and bicycles. Existing duties on the following i:Jems will be convention a-lised - sugar, inner tubes, cotton yarns, transmission belting, lubricants, outer covers, tin, iron and steel tubes, 3ewing machines, wool yarns, writing nibs, fountain pens and office requisites.      For Colonial goods reductions have been obtained in respect of cardamoms and copra, and conventionalisation of existing duties for nutmegs, mace, cloves, cocoa aad tea.    The duty provision for motor cars provides a preference of 25 per cent, for the lower powered cars, in which the United Kingdom is specially interested.It is not possible to put a value on these concessions as this will depend upon the use which traders will make of them.6.    Import Restrictions.    Requests for reducing the effect of import restrictions have been very fully met.    These include abolition of import restrictions on herrings;    sufficient licences for purchase arrangement goods;    restrictions not to be operated to prevent the full benefits of tariff concessions from accruing to United Kingdom goods;   no new restrictions to be imposed on tariff concession   items; as regards all other United Kingdom goods trade not to be restricted below that of 1933, and the Estonian Government to consult with H.M.. Government if new restrictions are imposed.    It is not possible to estimate the money value of these provisions.7*    Oil&apos;    The Estonians hove met our principal request that Russian oil should not receive any preferential treatment in any way in Estonia, but they are not prepared to withdraw preferences (already allowed by our Commercial Treaty with Estonia) to oil from other J3altic States (in effect Latvia). They have also agreed to give most-favoured-nation treatment in all respects to oil marketed in Estonia by United Kingdom firms, whether the oil is of United Kingdom origin or not.    This is a concession for which United Kingdom oil coinnrnies hove pressed,
8. Trade Balance.    A satisfactory trade balance clause has been agreed under which Estonia undertakes to encourage the importation of goods from the United Kingdom.-     In estimating the tradG balance, oil (of whatever origin) imported by United Kingdom firms is naturally to be taken into consideration,  in view of the concessions granted with regard to oil from any source marketed by United Kingdom firms in Estonia (see paragraph 7 above).      It is not possible to estimate thev value of this clause but it gives considerable scope for pressuro09. Exchange. provision has been made (in a confidential letter) fGr exchange to be granted at due date for United Kingdom goods consigned at the time of export to Estonia and entering Estonia by sea, and for petroleum and 530 tr oleum products from any source invoiced in sterling imported by sea by United Kingdom traders,  and for payments due to United Kingdom shipping interests.     This is a safeguard for securing the advantages of other concessions and therefore calls for no separate estimate.-10. Commercial Travellers&apos;  Licence Pees.     A clause similar to that in the Anglo-Pinnish Agreement has been obtainede This provides for a reduction in the licence fee from 50 Ekr,. per month to 20 Ekr. for two weeks and for the exemption from the tax of directors and principal officers of firms having agents in Estonia.H&quot; Russian Preferences.      Under the existing Treaty Estonia has the right to grant preferential treatment to Russian goods-A confidential undertaking has been obtained that such treatment will not be granted in respect of petroleum and petroleum products or in respect of any items mentioned in the Tariff Schedules.     As all items of importance to British trade are covered by the Tariff Schedules the effect is to exclude preferences to Russia on goods in which British traders are interested.
12.  Shipping.      Provision has been made in the agreement for Estonia to encourage the increased use of British shipping in the trade between the two countries.     The position of the existing British line (the United Baltic) in this trade has thus been secured from hindrances by Government action.      In confidential undertakings Estonia agrees to encourage the use of British shipping in all Estonian trade and to provide exchange for payments due to United Kingdom shipping interests.     Provision is made in the Agreement for the termination at short notice of the shipping clauses of the main treaty in the event of a change of policy in either country in regard to the treatment of foreign shipping.Commercial Relations and Treaties Department, Board of Trade,      S.W.I.
