HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIN,!C MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)EGRET. .P.  165 (54).COPY NO.   H QC A B I N E T.FOREIGN DEBTS CLEARING OFFICES AND IMPORT RESTRICTIONS (REPRISALS) BILL.Memorandum by the Chancellor&apos; of Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.Terence &quot;net 4)lusionIn accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at its last meeting,    the German Government -were informed on Thursday afternoon last that His Majestyrs Government intends shortly to propose legislation which would enable them to set up an Anglo-German Clearing Office, but that they would be prepared to refrain from the exercise of these powers if a satisfactory agreement ensuring fair treatment to British bondholders and British commerce can be negotiated before July 1st.We now circulate a draft Bill which has been prepared on the instructions of the President of the Board of Trade in consultation with the various Departments concerned.-The Bill gives to the Government power (l) to set up a Clearing Office in cases where payments due to this country are withheld as the result of debt defaults,  or transfer suspensions, or exchange restrictions, and (2) to impose quantitative import restrictions as a reprisal against foreign import restrictions which are discriminatory against this country.After full consideration we come to the conclusion that the power to set up Clearing Offices should be in general terms and should not be confined to the case of Germany alone. We do not, however, recommend that there should be any widespread use of these powers, and we think that for the present we should refuse to make use of this except in the special case of Germany.    The Anglo-German Clearing stands as a special case
because it would be a measure of defence in regard to a&quot;refusal to continue the service of the Dawes and   Young   Loans, which should have an absolute priority and were issued as the result of inter-Governmental negotiations.    As regards the other German loans which were issued in London and are held by British investors, it is too early to state at present whether we shall need to bring them within the scope of the clearing, but if we do so it will be as a measure of defence in regard to discrimination against us which no other defaulting country has attempted.      There are, of course, a large number of other foreign loans in default, but in some cases (e.g.  Chile) payment is genuinely impossible at present, while in other cases agreements have been reached with the creditors or sufficient reasonable settlements have been put into force by the debtor.Apart from defaults of foreign bonds,  the exchange restrictions generally practised abroad have given rise to much complaint from British traders, and there was at one time a considerable demand that we should set up Clearing Offices for the collection of trade debts.    But at present this demand is seldom made.      This may be partly due to the fact that many of the traders who were most severely hit by exchange restrictions have since confined their business to a cash basis.    The blocked trade debts, which we had outstanding in the small European countries, were never vary large in comparison with our total trade, and they have now to a considerable extent been paid off at some loss to the creditors, who have had to accept.a discount. In the Argentine, where the amounts involved were large, the matter has been dealt with by the Roca Agreement, and it is hoped to make a similar agreement with Uruguay.    Under present circumstances most British traders would probably
prefer to collect their frozen debts as best they can and to avoid the considerable Governmental interference with trade which the Clearing Office system inevitably involves.-The only other powers which will be -given to the Government by the Bill are powers to impose restrictions on the importation into the United Kingdom of goods from a foreign country where that foreign country imposes restrictions which are discriminatory or specially detrimental to the United Kingdom.      Tne practice of imposing import restrictions for bargaining purposes was first ovenly adopted by Prance, and Holland has now followed the French example.      Our existing means of defence against this procedure are -mite inadequate, and unless we obtain effective powers, such as other countries possess, to meet like with like,   there is grave danger of this procedure being adopted widely against us.We have always opposed the system of import restrictions on general principles, and it is not,  therefore, proposed that powers should be taken in the Bill to impose restrictions of a general character, but the provisions ere expressly designed to meet like with like and could only be applied to countries in respect of which no most favoured nation obligations exist in - the matter of import restrictions (e.g. Holland) or to countries which interpret their most favoured nation obligations towards us in a discriminatory fashion (as France has done).    Apart from France and Holland, we have most favoured nation obligations in the matter of import restrictions towards most foreign countries. In regard to some countries (e.g. Poland) it will be possible for us to denounce our Commercial Treaty at short notice,  though this is a method not likely to be adopted since Commercial Treaties contain safeguards in regard to many other matters, such as protection of persons,  companies, shipping and navigation, property, etc.
If the Cabinet approve the Bill,  it is proposed that it should be introduced this week and should receive a -Second Reading and pass through all stages in both Houses of Parliament in the week beginning June 25th.    7vre should then be in a position to set up an Anglo-German Clearing Office on July 1st or shortly afterwards,  if no satisfactory agreement has been reached with the German Government in the meantime.(Intld.)
