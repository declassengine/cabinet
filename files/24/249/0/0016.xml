IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC JMA JESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .2 0 RJJL-T,C A B. I N E T.THE KENYA LAND COMMISSION REPORT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer &quot;and, the Secretary of State for War.The Commissioners appointed to report on questions affecting land and the natives in Kenya have seen fit to propose that the Imperial Exchequer should meet the cost of their recommendations by allocating to this purpose &quot;the sum of nearly  50,000 owing by the Imperial Exchequer in respect of unclaimed balances of pay due to native carriers of the Military Labour Corps, who died or disappeared while employed in the campaign against German East Africa&quot;.The Colonial Secretary endorses this view.      For the reasons set out below we do not accept the validity of this argument and are strongly opposed to any payment being made on this account.      We further consider that if it had been intended to refer this matter to the Commissioners, we should have been consulted beforehand. We are of the opinion, however, that they had no mandate for referring to the question at all, and that they have in fact pronounced judgment on a problem outside their terms of reference after taking evidence from only one of the parties to the case at issue.2. In the first place the question cannot be confined to Kenya.      The latest total for these unclaimed balances is approximately  150,000, and it is spread over nativesp, 12S (54),
of a number of -East African Territories in approximately the following manner:-.0Tanganyika 90,500Kenya 49,000Uganda 3,200Zanzibar 7,300If the proposal in respect of Kenya were acceptedit would follow that similar claims in respect of theother Territories would also have to be met to a totalof  101,000c3, The proposal of the Colonial Office has hitherto been that the sum claimed should be distributed amongst the tribes to which the missing men belonged.    It is, however,  impossible to be sure of the extent to which the tribes concerned supported us in the War even if they were not actively hostile, and it would be out of the question to make any payment to tribes which were hostile to the British Government during the war.The present Colonial Office proposal is that the money should be handed to the Kenya    Government to meet the cost of measures to be taken by that Government on behalf of certain natives, necessitated, it would appear, by mistakes of administration in the past.    It will, therefore, become a matter of pure chance whether the natives who will benefit from these land measures will belong to the same tribes as those to whose members balances of pay were due.4. Every reasonable effort was made in the yearssucceeding the War to pay these balances over to the individuals to whom they were due.      It is true that in 1921 - objection was taken to a proposal to engage a special staff at an unknown but substantial cost to search for individual claimants, but the Governments Of
the Territories concerned were encouraged to take all practicable steps to bring to the notice of the general population that claims might still be submitted. Arrangements were) maae, afc the Imperial expense, to deal with such claims and payment has in fact been made to all authenticated cases up to 31st March, 1931. 5. The figure of  150,000 is not a true figure of theamount due,    Balances of deserters are included in this total, and it is on record that desertion was rampant. Further a considerable number of those reported as &quot;missing&quot; found their way to their homes, and in many cases served again under another name.      Finally, examination of the accounts of the Corps has disclosed large overpayments. A single amount of  3,000 had been written off on this account and other sums of a similar nature have no doubt been dealt with locally without the War Office being aware of the details.    These over-payments could not, of course, be held to invalidate authenticated individual claims, but they certainly cannot be overlooked in any proposal to make a genera.], settlement in which the interest of the individual is merged in that of the community. 6. This matter first came to notice in 1920 when theWar Office learnt that the Governments of Kenya and Uganda had passed Ordinances appropriating these unclaimed balances to the tribal organisations.    It is significant that when the matter was brought to the attention of Lord Milner -then Secretary of State for the Colonies - although sympathetic to the provisions of the Ordinances he considered that they could not be defended in view of the fact that Imperial Funds were concerned.    If he had felt that the terms of the Ordinances were right in principle though issued without proper authority,  it cannot be doubted that he would have pressed for their retention.
7, The matter was first brought to the attentionof the Cabinet in June, 1925 in a paper (CP. 302( 25)) circulated hy Mr, Amery when Secretary of State for the Colonies,      In this paper Mr. Amery traced the history of the question during and since the War, and asked the Cabinet to agree to the full amount of the unclaimed balances,  then estimated at about  165,000, being re-voted to be applied for the benefit of the tribes.      The Secretary of State for War, then Sir L.  Worthington Evans, circulated a paper (C. P., 353( 25) ) in which he set out the War Office views of the matter in opposition to Mr. Amery&apos;s proposal,  concluding that if any payment were made, a course to which he was strongly opposed, such payment should be borne on the Colonial Office vote and defended in Parliament by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Cabinet at that time (July, 1925) reserved the question for further consideration;    but later in the year Mr. Amery intimated that he did not then wish to pursue the matter.In Leoembsr, 1923, Mr. Amery again brought the question to the attention of the Cabinet (CP. 399(28) ) , reviving the proposals made by him in 1925 and suggesting reference to a Cabinet Committee.      This suggestion was not approved by the Cabinet,  the Prime Minister (Mr.  Baldwins-holding that in view of the lapse of time it was undesir-able to raise the question again (January, 1929).Since that time, although there has been cor-respondence between Ministers at the Colonial Office and at the War Office, the matter has not been brought up for consideration by the Cabinet.8. The German Government in 1925 sent out aCommission to East Africa to pay arrears of wages due to
natives who tools: part in the East African campaign. Their liabilities were estimated, at some  600,000 and they actually paid approximately  234,000.      Payments were only made in authenticated individual cases, and unclaimed balances were retained.      Their action in fact has been exactly the same as ours.&apos; 9. It has been suggested in support of theproposal to pay the sums over to the tribal organisations that in the Imperial Army similar   unclaimed balances are devoted to military charities, and do not revert to the Exchequer.      This needs qualification.      The procedure,  effected under the Regimental Debts Act, only applies to soldiers who die on service.      In the case of these native carriers those returned as deserters or missing accounted for 50 per cent of the sums due to Kenya,  and for 90 per cent in the case of Tanganyika. There Is ground for supposing that the missing consisted predominantly of deserters, and on this assumption the amount due to the natives of Kenya under the analogy of the Regimental Debts Act would be  23,750 instead of  49,000 and to the other Territories  12,800 instead of  101,000. .10. The sum at issue has not been p;aid Into anysuspense account.      If the claim were accepted in full some  150,000 of new money would have to be found and a Supplementary Estimate taken.      If&quot; the alleged analogy to the Regimental Debts Act were made the basis of a grant the amount would be  56,000.In considering how the House of Commons would regard such a proposal,  it should not be forgotten that there is an outstanding War debt due from Kenya and
i LUganda of over  2,000,000 on which,  save for a payment of  115,000 by Uganda in 1923, they have not as yet paid a penny.     We think that in these circumstances any proposal to   make a payment to Kenya on this account so long after the War would undoubtedly give rise to much criticism.      If the Cabinet consider that some ex gratia payment should be made,  we are of the opinion that the most that should be done is  to say that Kenya and the other Territories concerned must themselves find the amounts agreed upon, and that we should set them off against their War debts and regard them as instalments towards their payment.11. But for the reasons given above we hope thatthe Cabinet will decide that the claim is not one that should be met.        There is little or no evidence that, outside Kenya, the question is regarded as one of injustice to the natives, and is still open for decision.      There are always many people ready to champion the cause of native grievances, real or imaginary, and the fact that there has been relatively so little reference to this matter outside Kenya is not consistent with the view that the action taken is a dishonourable betrayal of native interests.      The publication of so distorted and incomplete an account of this matter as that incorporated - in our view most improperly - in this Report will of course so inflame public opinion that sober consideration of the question will become exceedingly difficult.(Intld.)   N.C.4th May, 1934.
