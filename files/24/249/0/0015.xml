3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT,RET. COPY NOo 3 9.187(54) .CAD I N E T. COAL MINES BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade,My colleagues may remember that on the 23rd March, 1933, I announced in the House that unless by the middle of the following month the coalowners had submitted proposals for the amendment of Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, providing for the inter-district co-ordination of minimum prices and for separate quotas for the inland and export trades, the Government would take the earliest opportunity of introducing legislation to confer on the Board of Trade the necessary powers itself to amend the Schemes in force under the Act.      This announcement was made after the coalowners had been discussing amendments for over 12 months without reaching agreement.      In the hope that further consideration of the problem would enable the industry to come to an agreement in the matter, we waited for nearly a year more before taking action, and then the Coal Mines Bill was introduced.When the Bill was introduced the industry was not even making a pretence of considering proposals for the amendment of the 1930 Act, and the Secretary for Mines had been informed by the Chairman of the Mining Association that hope of agreement had been abandoned.     The introduction of the Bill and its terms came as a shock to the coalowners.      It is doubtful whether they had appreciated that the Government was prepared to go to the length of imposing amendments of the Schemes by legislation.When the Second Reading of the Bill was taken in the House of Commons on 28th March, it was known that those districts,
particularly Northumberland and South Wales, which had previously been adamant in their opposition to any proposalinvolving separate allocations for the inland and export tradesjwere wavering in that opposition&apos;, although there was not atthat time any certainty that unanimity would be reached withinthe industry.     During the Second Reading Debate, therefore, theHouse was informed that -&quot;if the ihdustry can produce an agreed scheme adequately dealing with the matters contained in the Bill the Government will give effect to such an agreement under the Act Of 1930 by Order and withdraw the Bill&quot;,The knowledge that the Bill had received a Second Reading and that it was proceeding in the normal way to Standing Committee enabled those districts which were willing to submit proposals to bring persistent pressure upon the recalcitrant districts, and in the end it was agreed by all districts that the industry should submit proposals to the Government to provide for inter-district co-ordination of minimum prices, and separate allocations for the inland and export trade.In order to make these proposals effective, extensive amendments of all the Schemes are necessary.     The Central Council were therefore informed that before any steps could be taken to retard the progress of the Bill it would be necessary for the Council and for each District Executive Board to furnish a written assurance to the wines Department that the respective Schemes would be amended in a manner considered satisfactory by the Government.I am glad to say that all these assurances have been received and on the 24th April the Secretary for Mines announced in the House that further proceedings on the Coal Mines Bill would be suspended.The various bodies of coalowners are now actively considering the representations that they must make to the Board of Trade under the provisions of the 1930 Act that the
requisite amendments may be made, and when these are received the necessary draft Orders will be laid before Parliament for approval.      I hope it will be possible to do this within the next fortnight.     A resolution by each House approving the Order for amendment of the Central Scheme will be required,      I is deemed -prudent to keep the Bill technically alive until amendment&apos; of the Scheme   is actually effected.I think that it should be put on record that this satisfactory conclusion reflects great credit on the Secretary for Mines, who has borne the whole weight of the difficult negotiations involved in the settlement of this question.vV,R.rd of Trade, 4th hay,  1934
