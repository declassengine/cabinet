Ci P &quot;3jrailFIDEryTIAL. A.0.296.BOARD Off TRADE ADVISORY COUHOIL. 3TAT4 OF TRADE - ArRIL,  1934.Summary of   Reports, supmiutea py members of the Board of Trade advisory Council (supplemented in some case J&quot; v/ith statistical information from other sources.)Employment.The total number of persons on the registers ofjimployment exchanges in Great Britain at 23rd April was2,148,195, a decrease of 53,362 as compared with 19th Larch.The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by70,673, hut the number temporarily stopped increased by 17,291.The changes between 23rd April and 19th March in thedifferent Divisions were:London ...................... - 14,766South eastern............... - 10,568South Western............... - 5,917Midlands.................... - 2,218Worth Eastern............... - 7,035North Western............... t 2,422Scotland.................... - 14,433Wales ....................... - 867The estimated number of insured, persons in employment at23rd April was 10,140,000, being 82,000 more than a monthbefore and 638,000 more than a year before.The improvement during the month was most marked in thebuilding, public works contracting and allied trades,engineering, shipbuilding and shiprejjairing, vehicle building,the iron and steel industry, manufacture of electrical apparatusand appliances, tailoring and dressmaking, furniture manufacturecertain food manufacturing industries, the distributive trades,hotel and boarding house services and most of the transport services.iiimployment declined in coal mining and in most of the textile industries.
Overseas Trade - Imports in April were  56.3 million . and total exports  35.1 m. compared with  51.1 m. and  29.9 m. respectively in April, 1933.      Of the increase of  5.2 m. In imports,  4.1 m. was in raw materials, including  0.9 m. for cotton,  0.8 m. for wood and timber,  0.6 m. for wool and  0.4 m. for rubber.     Exports of imported merchandise isere  5.0 m. as against  3.5 m. in April, 1933.     The excess of imports over exports in April was approximately the same as in April last year, namely    21.2 m.     For the first four months of the year the excess was  95.2 m. as against  77.8 in. in the same period of 1933.Road and fiail Traffic - Railways:   During the 4 weeks ended 29th April, 1934, the railway traffic receipts were  5,000 (0.05^) more than in the corresponding period of 1933.     The incidence of the Easter holidays affects the comparison, Good Friday falling within this period in 1933 but not in 1934.     For the 17 weeks ended 29th April the increase was  2,577,000 (5.95,^).     The percentage changes in the various classes of traffic were:-4 weeks ended       17 weeks ended 29th April. 29th AprTHPassenger Train Traffic...,       - 13.0 + 0.10Merchandise, minerals and live stock ..............       +    9.58 +11.45Coal, coke and patent fuel,       * 16.41 * 8.07In February 1934 the number of passengers (excludingseason ticket holders) conveyed on railways (other than thoseof the London Passenger Transport Board and the fifhitechapeland Bow Joint Railway) was 7.1$ more than in February, 1933.For the 4 weeks ended 24th February freight tonnage was10.9% more than a yaar ago.     The largest increases were inminerals and merchandise (33.5;&apos;i) and in other merchandise(13.0$).
For the month of February 1934 the following percentage increases over 1933 quantities are recorded:-Iron and steel.............,. 47.iron ore..................... 57.2Bricks....................... 45.2Pig iron..................... 43.0Limestone for blast furnaces. 64.3Gravel and sand.............. 40.7Motors;    The number of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, newly registered in March was 37,127 or 8,368 (2.9.1$) more than in Aiarch, 1933.     The increase comprises 5,811 private cars and 2,557 goods and other vehicles. Registrations of motor cycles increased by 1,621 (32.5;%).Finance and Banking.      (1) London.     Stock Exchange prices advanced during the first half of April, culminating In a short-lived spurt on the day after the Budget announcements, but, save for rubber shares which received a sustained stimulus from.the restriction scheme,  they have since declined.     Gilt-edged shares at first advanced with the announcement of the issue of the 5% funding Loan but shortly afterwards declined when dealings in that stock opened at a discount;   they became firmer again after the Budget announcement of a reduction in Income Tax but subsequently weakened.     Money outside the clearing banks continued short and borrowers had to cay ff? to 1/8%, while also having recourse to the banks for fresh money at 1%,     Discount rates showed little change.The franc has gathered strength, particularly in the forward discount market, as a result of the improved financial outlook in France.     The dollar   also has recovered with the opposition of President Roosevelt to the inflationary proposals of Congress and with the announcement that the export of gold would be allowed, should the dollar fall below the gold export point.
(2) Francs.      Opposition to the economy cuts has been surprisingly mild and the revival of confidence in the public finances is shown by the sharp rise which has occurred in the price of Rentes.     The upward movement was uninterrupted except for the set-back on April 25th clue to a rumour, promptly denied by the Minister of Finance, that the Treasury was contemplating a new issue.     The sharpness of that set-back suggests that the time is not yet ripe for fresh Government borrowing.     Further evidence of the increased confidence in the country is the flow of gold back to France from Switzerland and Holland, and to some extent from London. Frs. 1,970 mn. of the Frs. 3,400 mn. lost since January have thus returned.The broad outlines of the Minister of Labour&apos;s public works programme are now known.      It is intended to concentrate on the building of bridges,  canals, motor roads, etc. for the use of which tolls can be levied, and the work is to be financed out of the social insurance funds held by such institutions as the Old Age Pension Fund.      Industry and commerce In France are still suffering from the high internal cost of production which is the result partly of the world depression and partly of the over valuation of the francj but the lowering of money rates which is already taking place will give some relief.(3) Germany.     Uncertainty as to the outcome of the negotiations between the Reichsbank and the foreign medium and long term creditors caused uneasiness as to the immediate future.     The   gold and devisen reserve of the Renohsbanlc fell to 5.8)3 of the note issue on 30th April.     The restrictions on the exportation of Reichsmark notes and on the sale and delivery of securities held abroad by German
nationals have also been made more stringent.     An export surplus was realized for   March but as it was largely due to the &quot;additional exports&quot; scheme it Is not a true guide to Germany&apos;s competitive position.     The Governments programme of expenditure is already pausing prices to rise slightly and this must affect her power to compete.     The Bourse has been disturbed by the very unsatisfactory operating results in 1933 of the Hamburg-America and North German Lloyd lines, and by the announcement cf dividend reductions by prominent companies.(4) United States of America.   The Presidents resistance to certain inflationary measures before Congress, and to the more radical aspects of the Silver Bills, strengthened the dollar but lad also to a break in security and commodity prices.     Grains were also affected by the statement of the Secretary for Agriculture that United States and world prices of farm produce must approximate if America&apos;s surpluses were to find markets abroad.     The price of gold in America is 69% above its former oarity;   domestic agricultural commodities have advanced half as much, with the exception of wool and cotton which have risen   to the full extent.     Since the gold buying policy began in October the rise in price of agricultural commodities has been negligible, but the prices of some finished goods, chiefly as the result of the     N.R.A. Codes, stand not far off 1929 levels.The Administration appears to be less reluctant to modify the Securities Act, which in Its oresent form is drying up the flow of new capital into industry, and therefore defeating the objects of the Government&apos;s easy money policy.Business activity is still fair, but in some sections there is an inclination to lower prices owing to resistance by consumers, and the textile industry, particularly wool and silk, is suffering from the disparity between demand price and the new supply nrice,
Coal - The average v/eekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 21st April, 1934, was 4,625,000 tons, compared with 4,283,000 tons a year ago, an increase of 8%.     The average number of persons employed during this period was 788,200 as against 790,200 a year before.     Exports in April were 6% greater than in the corresponding month of 1933. Exports to Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Egypt and Brazil in particular showed an increase.     As regards inland trade home consumption in March was 8f: higher than a year ago.Iron and Steel - The output in April of pig iron at 496,300 tons was about the same as in March, but after allowing for the shorter working month and the Easter holidays the average daily output showed an increase of 2 .     There was a net gain of three furnaces in blast.     The output of steel ingots and castings in April was 716,800 tons as against 834,50C tons in March, but the average daily rate of production was at approximately the same level as in the preceding month.     An active home demand is evident for practically all products, and, 8s many contracts are due to terminate, an expansion in forward buying is expected before long.     Export trade, despite some signs of expansion, is still far from satisfactory, intense competition being encountered from the Continent, particularly in pig iron.     As regards semi-finished material, though demand is quieter, the output is still being absorbed and imports from the Continent are tending to increase. Finished steel is in good demand, especially with the engineering industries;    enquiries from overseas have increased, but the quantities&apos; involved are usually small.In Scotland a slight falling off in activity is reported and new business in many branches is quiet.     Specifications from the shipyards are being received on a better scale than for some time past.     Some orders for the export market are expected, but there is little hope of any considerable expansion
On the North-^ast Coast the.consumption of pig iron is causing a reduction in stocks, hut the intexisity of foreign competition prevents any large expansion of foreign business. Steel works are working on a fairly favourable scale, but imports from the Continent, due to price cutting by the International Cartel, are causing apprehension,      The tonnage on order at the end of April was slightly more than at the end of March, several substantial orders have been placed for rails and plates;    and increased demand is expBcted from the shipyards.,      Business in sections and joists has been fairly substantial.In South wales there is activity in sheet and tinplate bars and a slight expansion of business in billets.     The demand for pig iron is poor owing to considerable forward buying previously.      The tinplate industry worked at some 57^ of capacity during April, but sales were below that level.     A number of export orders are expected.In the Sheffield district activity is being maintained at a comparatively high level.      The area is produc ing   steel at a rate exceeding one and a quarter million tons per annum, as compared with the largest pre-war output of 880,000 tons in 1913.      Special alloy steels are inactive demand and the output of stainless stec.1 is attaining record proportions.kachine Tools. - Vith the continued activity in the home trade it is difficult in many places, particularly the liidlands, to find suitable labour.      The export trade remains unsatisfactory, being hampered by quotas, high tariffs and exchange restrictions.    . The value of exports in April was  134,479, as against  105,077 in karch and  75,563 in February. The French market is still virtually closed, exports to France in April amounting to only  4,878,      Russia, however,
oontinueo to increase her imports of British maohine tools, talcing in March 32$ and in April, 30$ of our total exports. The amount of the premium charged by the Export Credits Department for the insurance of Russian bills, although it has been reduced, is still considered a hindrance to the development of trade.    The total imports of machine tools in April amounted to  77,967, as against  94,088 in March.Cotton.    Even after making allowance for the fewer working days there is normally some decline in production during April as compared with March.    This year, however, deliveries of raw cotton to spinners during April amounted to 219,000 bales, against 214,000 in March.    New business, which has been scarce since the beginning of the year, showed some signs of improvement at the end of April and there was some tendency for spinning margins to improve especially in the Egyptian section.   At the moment, however, there is some uncertainty as to whether the price agreements will continue to oommand general support especially in the coarser counts.   Raw cotton prices fell steadily during April, but the margin between American and Indian prices narrowed and this may check the tendency for Indian cotton to replace American.    In the spinning section there was a slight drop in unemployment figures from an average of 20.8$ in &quot;march to 20.6$ in April.    There was practically no change in the weaving section but next month should witness an improvement corresponding to that among the spinners. -Recently, however, increased outlets for yarn have been 3?ound in industries other than weaving, e.g. the market for hosiery yarns.Exports of cotton yarn in April were 10.74 million lbs.,, as against 11.91 million lbs. in March and 9.34 million lbs. in April 1933.    India and Denmark took smaller quantities, but exports to Sweden, Holland and Roumania showed comparatively large inoreases.    exports  of piece goods
in April showed a decline of IQfa oompared with April last year.    The fall was particularly heavy in the case of bleached cloth (from 60  to 49 million sq. yds.), owing to smaller takings by Morocco, Turkey, India and China.    China took only 884,000 sq. yds. of pieoe goods, against 3,092,000 sq. yds. in April, 1933, but exports to Canada, at 5.6 million sq. yds., increased by 150j .    Colombia, a most promising market during the last two years, took only 2.6 million as against 5.1 million sq. yds,, but trade with the other South American countries was well maintained.    The feeling in India is better, though actual trade in the first four months of this year has been less than a year ago.Mo tor Indus try -   The reduction in motor oar taxation-has already had a stimulating effect on the home market.    The larger scale production of higher powered cars may be expected ultimately to facilitate expansion in exports.In South Africa, where there is no preference,  the Budget provides for the reduction of duty on motor parts imported by foreign assembling works established in the Union. It is now learned that the Nyasaland Government is unlikely to substitute ad valorem duties for the present horse power duties on motor cars - a change opposed by the industry.Negotiations with Denmark for improved quotas of United Kingdom motor products have been successful, and an Inoreased volume of trade is confidently expected for the remainder of 1934.    The payment of rebates on United Kingdom oars imported into Spain is still delayed.     Business is, in consequence, being lost and Spanish distributors are growing dissatisfied with, their British Agencies.Lighter Metal Industries -   The demand for metal windows is increasing with the advance in speculative building, State development and flat building.    There has been a slight seasonal decline in trade in cutlery,  silver
27/Aand electroplate, but the position is better than a year ago.     The demand for wood workers&apos; tools has slackened slightly but engineer-ing tools show a definite improvement.     Demands for metal. smallwares previously imported from the U.S.A. and Germany continue to increase.     In the needle industry the usual seasonal decline has not so far occurred and trade is reported good in the fishing tackle, enamelled hollowara. and foundry industries.     The Association of producers in the metallic bedstead trado came into effective operation on 16th April, but the 15% increase in prices has not had time to take effect.     In the lock and allied trades. prospects are good although Japanese competition has been felt. The position in the architectural metal work industry cannot improve sufficiently until progress is made in municipal and public building.     Meanwhile negotiations are proceeding for the formation of an Architectural Metal Workers Association.     The press work and sheet metal work   industries continue to be very busy on account of the activity in the motor industry.     Non-ferrous metal mills are still well employed although in some instances new orders have not come forward quite so freely since Saster.     Prices of copper,tin, spelter and lead have fluctuated within narrow limits during the. month.Chemicals - Sales of alkalies, acids and industrial nitrogen products have been satisfactory, and exports have remained steady. Home deliveries of chlorine products have declined slightly chiefly owing to reduced demand among rayon manufacturers.     Business in coal tar products was normal;    cresote oil continued in good demand Sales of dyestuffs for April show a slight falling off as compared with March figures but were substantially higher than a year ago. The essential oil market improved slightly but is still erratic. Deliveries of fertilizers were well sustained but the demand - or sulphate of ammonia now seems to be slackening.     The market for 1 pharmaceutical chemicals improved somewhat, with activity in certain seasonal products like aspirin, bromides and phenacetin. Trade in wood distillation products, especially methyl acetate a\.d wood naphtha, was brisk.     Wood tar and wood creosote alone cended to be dull.
Soap.. Oils end Kindred Industries - There is little change in the soap trade, deliveries remaining normal.     The margarine trade has experienced the usual slight decline which occurs immediately after Easter.     The first four months of this year show a decline of nearly 12% as compared with the same period a year ago.     Prices of edible oils and fats are somewhat depressed owing to the large quantities of pure lard offered at low prices.Electricity - During April 1,187 million units were produced as compared with 953 million a year before.     The inorease this year over the first four months of 1933 is 18.5$.      60% of productive capacity was in use, against 55 - in March.     Orders received for heavy plant in the home market were lower than in April 1933, hut export orders were higher, the total showing a slight decrease compared with a year ago.     The demand for light apparatus shows considerable improvement and exports in March amounted to  616,913, against  568,533 in March, 1933.     The industry is experiencing difficulty in stating prices in foreign markets when submitting applications to the Import Duties Advisory Committeej    for instance German accessories described as &quot;English Standard Types&quot; or &quot;B.E.S.A.&quot; are specifically manufactured for export to this market and have no value in their country of origin, as they do not comply with German standards&quot;.Paper.     There was a distinct decline in the demand for fine papers and Canadian competition in newsprint was intensified, prices remaining unremunerative.     The increase in the import duty on paper boards has had a tonic effect on certain sections of the industry but the exemption from that increase of Kraft Liner boards and strawboards was a disappointment.     Water conditions in Scandinavia have improved and mechanical pulp is now available st somewhat lower prices.     British consumers have, however, been obliged to book substantial contracts at the previous higher prices in order to secure their requirements for the winter.
Retail Trade.    The value of retail sales in March was 5.7$ greater than in March, 1933.     This was the sixth consecutive monthly increase,,     The principal improvements were in sports and travel goods (15.3$), furnishing departments (10.3$), fancy departments (10.3$), hardware (7.75o), women&apos;s wear (6.9$), hoots and shoes (6.4$), sheets and tobacco (16.3$) and perishable goods (6.9$).      Salas of piece goods declined by 5.1$.     The improvement was felt by all districts,.     Suburban London showed the largest increase (7.9$) and Scotland the lowest (3.C^).     Except in Suburban London, stocks in March were somewhat greater than a year earlier.The international comparison of sales in department stores reveals increases for February of 16.0$ in the U.S.A. and 1.6$ in Great Britain, as compared with February, 1933. In Germany a decline, smaller than for some time, of 2*3$ was recorded.     In March there was an increase of 7.1$ in Great Britain and 44.Q$ in the U.S.A. as compared with a year earlier;   but March 1933 v/as the worst month of the depression in the U.S.A.Co-operative Trade.     The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the five weeks ending 14th April were 10.1$ more than in the corresponding period, of last year. The wholesale prices of seven principal commodities showed a decrease in price of 1.84$ compared with 12 months ago. The retail prices of Societies are estimated to have increased by 0.76$.Shipping.     The index number of shipping freights (1913 s 100) for April was 75.60, as compared with 78*03 in March,  and 73.76 a year ago.EMPIRE.Canadian Trade.     The index of the physical volume of business increased from 86.4 in February to 93.1 in March 1934.
i-274Exports of copper, nickel, and zinc shov/ed-marked^gains,^but.^ the increase in silver shipments was less than normal for the season.     Production of wheat flour and rolled oats was greater.     Exports of cheese and canned salmon increased sharply, hut sugar production was lower.      The index of the output of   food products at 78.5 in March compared with 75.9 in February showed a slight advance.     The output of news-print was greater than in any month since October 1930. There was an increase in the output of steel ingots (after seasonal adjustment) of about 7% as compared with February and pig iron production also increased slightly.     The production of motor cars and trucks was 7,548 more than in March last year.     The seasonally adjusted index of employment in manufacturing plants was 89.3 on April 1st, as compared with 88.1 on March 1st,     Groups reporting improvement in employment include textiles and iron and steel.The total exports of merchandise showed an increase of more than 14% even after seasonal adjustment, and the increase in imports was also slightly more than normal for the season.Australian Trade.     From July 1st, 1933, to the end of March 1934, 2,483,285 bales of wool were received into store. Of these 2,396,748 have been disposed of.     Up to the end of April exports of wheat amounted to 27,854,741 bushels, and of flour to 233,338 tons.     Butter shipments now stand at 92,217 tons as compared with 93,686 tons last year.      In the eight months ended March 31st meat exports were valued at  4 million (Australian currency), being  67,000 more than a year before.     Total imports of merchandise in March 1934 amounted to  5,780,000, or  102,000 more than in March 1933.
South African Trade-  Buaines-e--continue-s--to- improve. The hudget statements of the Union and of the Railways and Harbour Administration have had an encouraging effect.     Total exports, other than gold, for the first three months of 1934 amounted to  3.2 million, against  6.4 million in the same months of 1933.     Exports of gold amounted in March, 1934, to  4.0 million, as compared with  5.3 million a year before. Total imports for the first quarter at  14.4 million were  3.9 million greater than in the corresponding quarter of 1933.     Gold mining continues to expand, but the diamond market, though some improvement is apparent, is still very much depressed.      The agricultural outlook, with the improvement in the locust situation, is fairly favourable^ but prices have been somewhat irregular.     The second estimate of the maize crop is 18,547,000 bags of 200 lbs. Most manufacturing industries are enjoying favourable conditions.      The building trade on the Reef is experiencing a boom and the clothing, engineering and motor trades are very active.Indian trade - Imports of merchandise into India in April, 1934, amounted to 1,095 lakhs as compared with 969 lakhs in the same month of 1933.     The imports for April were the highest since November,  1932.     Exports of merchandise in April amounted to 1,B35 lakhs as compared with 1,042 lakhs in April, 1933.The third wneat forecast for 1933/34 shows 34,925,000 acres and 9,899,000 tons against 32,992,000 acres and 9,452,000 tons last year.      The supplementary cotton forecast returns 23,739,000 acres and 4,970,000 hales as compared with 22,483,000 acres and 4,356,000 bales last year.SOUTH AMERICA.Argentina - The export surplus for the first three months of 1934 was 150 million paper pesos as against 68 million for
the same period of 1955.     The most marked improvement has been in live stock products, particularly wool (* 135$)  and hides C+ 39^), but the demand for wool has recently slackened.     The minimum prices fixed by the Government have much improved conditions in agriculture.      Over 3,575,000 tons of maize are officially announced to be available for export.      The demand for wheat from Europe has improved slightly and it is calculated that 9/10 ths of the export quota under the London &quot;Wheat Agreement for the year ending 3lst July have been already shipped. After some wealoiess the peso recovered slightly in the Free Exchange market.     General trade conditions are quiet and orders for all classes of imports are small.      In textiles British goods have led the market, but the demand has been mainly for the cheaper descriptions.     Japanese competition has increased.Brazil - The export surplus in January, 1934, amounted to 15.1 million gold pesos compared with 12.5 million in January, 1933.     Coffee stocks have tended to increase, but the early destruction of 3 million bags is announced and higher local prices appear to be anticipated.     The Tariff Commission has announced that the revision is nearly complete.      It will include reduced duties on a wide range of goods, including the raw materials of Brazilian industry, but will increase duties on woollens and cottons and other goods similar to those manufactured in Brazil.     The Commission is reported to have approved the substitution of a flat import surtax of id for the several existing supplementary taxes.All import bills &amp;re now subject to protest if a deposit of the equivalent amount in milreis is not made on due date.      This arrangement will tend further to restrict imports.There is little change in the generally favourable conditions prevailing in the domestic manufacturing industries.
Chile.- The past year was favourable to agriculture and both production and exports have improved.     The Minister of Finance has made an offer for the settlement of sterling bills outstanding on the London market.Colombia - The export surplus in January amounted to 2.1 million pesos at an average exchange value of 7.56 to the pound.      For the whole year 1933 the surplus was 22,7 million at an average exchange value of 5.40, the principal exports being coffee (49.3 million pesos), petroleum (9,9 million) and bananas (4.9 million).     During April, 1934, tha exchange fell owing to continued expenditure by the Government on Defence.     Internally business has improved and prices have risen.Peru - A new loan of 15 million soles for National Defence has been authorised, but latest reports speak of a settlement of the dispute with Colombia.Uruguay - The delegation to Great Britain is particularly anxious to improve the market for meat.     Wool exports in the five months ended February 1934 increased over the same period of 1933 by 8,450 bales, of which Great Britain took the greater part.Bolivia.     There has been little exchange available for commercial imports during the past two months and the situation is described as serious.
