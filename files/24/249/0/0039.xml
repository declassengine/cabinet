JhIS DOCOBIERT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAffKIC MA majesty S GOVfiRHMEKT. )gCREP. Copy Bo.     X_C A B I NET.52(34).TEMPORARY ASS IS TAMOS TO HSRRIEG- FISHIffG INDUSTRY.! -  &quot;MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY Off STATE FOR SCOTLAND.The herring fishing industry, in which 1,160 boats, 10,000 fishermen and an even larger number of shore workers were engaged last summer, is passing through very difficult times owing mainly to restriction of foreign markets which has only been partially relieved &quot;by our Trade Agreements.    In view of the situation the Sea Fish Coasaission appointed under the Act of 1933, have been asked urgently to investigate and report on the reorganisation of the industry.    Their Report is expected in August, but this will be too late to help the industry during the sunmer season lasting from June to September this year.In these cireurnstances a representative deputation from Scotland and England submitted on 10th May a request for financial assistance as a temporary measure this season in the form of a subsidy of 10/-per cran of herrings landed between June and September.    This proposal was definitely rejected on the ground among others that the benefit would not accrue to the fishermen.Sew proposals were subsequently submitted and have been careful^ exsuained by the Fishery Departments. As a result I now lay before the Cabinet the following proposed scheme :.-(l)   For the sole purpose of assisting the boats to fit out, anundertaking to be given to meet any amount by which the boafs share (i.e., about one-third) of the net returns falls short of  50 ( 35 for motor drifters) or the actual fitting out expenditure if less.    IThis undertaking will enable the boats, especially(1) in /
in Scotland,,  to meet the minimum charges which are necessary to allow them to go to sea in reasonably good condition.       The actual liability will depend on the results of the season and is unlikely to exceed  25,000.2) The provision of loans for the purchase of 24 net3 per boat (or 12 for the small boats) at  3. 10s.       per net.These loans, which are similar to loans given in 1924 and 1929,. will help to meet a serious deficiency in the supply of nets..   The maximum commitment if all boats applied would he upwards of  80,000 hut as in practice many boats will not apply it is proposed to limit the amount provided for this purpose to  50,000,3) The scheme is put forward on the basis thatthere will he sn actual reduction of the fleet  (which may reasonably he taken as at least 1.0%) as compared with last summer.    The industry have frankly stated that their figures (which show a reduction of about 14$ on the fleet engaged last summer) are estimates, and that they cannot guarantee that the estimate will be exactly adhered to though in their opinion it will not be rraterially exceeded.       I do not consider that a guarantee on this point can be obtained but the boats which will he eligible for assistance will be restricted to a maximum of 90^ of the number engaged last summer and the opinion of the Fishery Departments., based on knowledge of the local circumstances,  is that it may reasonably be accepted that there will be an actual reduction of at least 10jj ,4o  1/(2)
4o I submit that this scheme*, which has been preparedafter examination of numerous alternatives,, provides a reasonable means of meeting the immediate situation and I ask the Cabinet, ton the understanding that the details will ba settled with the Treasury, to authorise (l) the adoption of the scheme (8) the provision of the necessary funds in Supplementary Estimates, and (3) an announcement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.5-, The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has been consulted and concurs in the scheme on the understanding that English vessels will be eligible for assistance on the same terms as Scottish vessels so far as may be required. The figures given throughout the memorandum include provision far England as well as Scotland.(Sd0) GcPoCo3esitAsh Office,Whitehall, S0W0lc2nd June. 1934,(3)
