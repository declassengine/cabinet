The arguments for and against the holding of an imperial Conference in 1935 are set out in CP.  105 (34) and CP.  108 (34) respectively, and are summarised to the following effect in the Cabinet conclusion mentioned abo ve.3. In favour of the holding of a Conference next year it has been represented that 1935 will be the twenty-fifthblS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAR1TIO MAJESTY VS GOVERNMENT * )
anniversary of the Accession of His Majesty the King to the Throne3 that in all probability the Prime Ministers of the Dominions will be invited to London to  take part in any public celebrations and that an early discussion of important political questions concerning imperial and foreign affairs is,  if practicable, desirable.For various reasons it would be very undesirable, if not impracticable, to. hold an Imperial Conference in 1936:    if therefore the Conference is not held in 1935 it must be postponed until 1937.    This would mean that instead of the normal interval of three or four years, seven years would have elapsed since the last imperial Conference of 1930,4.        on the other hand it has been pointed out that the political questions referred to above could not be dis-ciissed at an Imperial Conference without economic questions being raised and that for the reasons given in the president of the Board of Trade&apos;s Memorandum discussion with the Dominions and India next year of certain economic questions would be most undesirable and embarrassing,,    Moreover it would be difficult, in 1955, for the Secretary of State for India, the India Office and the Government of India to make proper preparation for a Conference, in view cf their preoccupation with the constitutional problems and legislation.
50 In these circumstances we have reached theconclusion that it would he very inadvisable that a regular Imperial Conference should be held in 1935.6. It has however been suggested to us that whenthe Prime Ministers of the Dominions are invited to participate in the Anniversary celebrations of His Majesty&apos;s accession to the Throne to be held in London next year, the opportunity should be taken to inform them that their presence in England would enable informal discussions to take place with United Kingdom Ministers on certain important matters.      One of these would naturally he the question of the date for the holding of the next Imperial Conference.7. We recommend the Cabinet to adopt  this suggestion.If effect is given to it,  it will be possible to explain to the Dominion Prime Ministers the special reasons why it would be very inconvenient to the United KingdomGovernment that an Imperial Conference should be held in1936 and that we therefore should favour postponement ofthe Conference until 1937.     We may add that we see noreason why this arrangement should interfere with theproposed ad hoc informal discussions between the UnitedKingdom and the Dominions concerned on meat and dairy products on which our hands &quot;become free in June 1934 and august 1935 respectively.We accordingly recommend the Cabinet :-(l)  that it would be inadvisable to contemplate a formal Imperial Conference in the year 1935.(S)  that when the Prime Ministers of the Dominions are invited to participate in the Anniversary celebrations of His Majesty&apos;s accession to the Throne to be held in London next year, the opportunity should be taken to inform them that their presence in England would enable informal discussions to take place with United Kingdom Ministers on certain important matters.    One of these would naturally be the question of the date for the holding of the next Imperial Conference.
(3)  that at these informal discussions it could be explained why it would be very inconvenient,  so far as the United Kingdom is concerned,  that an Imperial Conference should be held in 1936 and that we should therefore favour postponement of the Conference until 1937.(4)  that there is no reason why this arrangement should interfere with the proposed ad hoc informal discussions between the United Kingdom and the Dominions concerned on meat and dairy products oSigned on behalf of the CommitteJ.
