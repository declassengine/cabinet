;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.I.P.158 (34). COPY NO.C A 3 I NET.i G cjPROPOSED EUROPEAN CONVENTION AGAINST AIR BOMBARDMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air. (Circulated with reference to CP.   15? (34).)1. Failing a General Arms Convention,  i.e., in circumstances where National land,  sea, and air armaments remain unlimitedand where Germany is presumably free to rearm,it is proposed that(i) &quot;the States of Europe in respect of territories in Europe vrould enter a solemn undertaking not to drop bombs on another persons territory in Europe, either in peace or in war, and further, to agree that if this undertaking was violated they would use the whole of their air forces to insist on the due observance of this promise and to punish anyone who required it&quot;(ii) that there should be &quot;some special arrangement about the Mediterranean&quot; including a suggestion that Malta should be regarded as European territory.2. This proposal appears to be based on the assumption thatfear of punitive air bombardment is a reliable deterrent to air action.      The threat of overwhelming and presumably therefore unrestricted bombing, is to be relied upon to prevent any State from bombing upon the territory of another State in Europe. This deterrent is apparently not intended to apply in the case of aggression by land or- sea forces.    It is not therefore to be used as a deterrent to war, but only as a deterrent (either before or after a war has broken out) to one particular act of warfare.
1 0JLoflBombing for any purpose (and against any objective) situated &quot;beyond a frontier&quot; would become automatically a definition of &quot;air aggression&quot; and the signal for universal and unrestricted^ aerial bombardment;.3. It seems highly probable that one of the firstresults of the &quot; sanctions1&apos; envisaged upon a violation of this form of prohibition of bombing would be at once to extend the area of conflict and increase the number of belligerents.    Once a Nation, in execution of the &quot;sanction&quot;, has bombed an &quot;air- aggressor&quot;, it has committed an act of war,  and inevitably exposes itself to every form of retaliation by land,  sea and air of which an enemy is capable.     The operation of the proposed &quot;sanction&quot; would almost inevitably result in war (and bombing) becoming unlimited in character and scope throughout Europe.4. On the other hand it may well be asked whether,when the time came  to apply sanctions -- possibly upon the flimsiest of pretexts - all the signatory Powers would proceed to do so.    Is it not possible that at least some of the Powers would find reasons for refusing to act, either from a desire not to become embroiled in war, or from a fear of the enemy,  or because they took a different view of the act of &quot;air aggression&quot;?    It is not impossible that in an extreme case we might find ourselves the only Nation that was giving effect to the sanction.5. Is the proposed rule to be automatically imposedwithout regard (i) to the character of the objective which had been bombed, or (ii) as to whether a state of war already existed or not, or (iii) as to whether the State which had bombed beyond its own frontier was the victim of aggression and invasion by land or sea forces?    If
these questions ve:ce not taken into consideration it might well be that the literal application of the air sanction rule would result in the perpetration of the most monstrous injustice.    On the other hand, to specify exceptions would compromise the principle involved, and introduce fresh complicat ions.6. Moreover, it would be relatively easy for a belligerent-ent intent upon bombing in order to achieve its ends, to find means by stratagem to deceive the Powers.    An aggressor Nation might resort to devices to give the impression that the other country had first violated the rule.    It will be remembered that when the Germans first used poison-gas in the war of 1914-1918, they announced a few days previously that it had been used against them.    A Nation desirous of carrying out bombing might drop a few bombs on its own territory, and then allege that it has been bombed, and thus bring down the wrath of Europe on the head of its innocent victim.    It is only a few months ago that, for purposes of propaganda, the Germans announced that a mysterious aeroplane had dropped leaflets over Berlin, and used this as an excuse to justify the formation of a Police Air Force,      Furthermore, difficulties are certain to arise in defining precisely what is an act of bombing.    Is the prohibition to be confined to the use of bombs, designed as they are to-day, for use by aircraft, or is it intended it shall apply to all projectiles discharged from aircraft,  including not only bombs, but also shells fired from guns carried in aircraft and machine-gun bullets?    If not, where is the line to be drawn between the permissible and non-permissible projectile?    Further, the impossibility of distinguishing whether explosions are caused, by long-range artillery fire (50 miles is well within the range of modern artillery) or by bombs dropped from aircraft, will certainly lead
to one or other of the belligerents alleging that bombing has taken place.7. In the application of this rule of war, manyanomalies would arise,    A State would,  it seems, be permitted to bomb an invader who had entered its territory, yet no matter how great a hostile concentration had been assembled just beyond the frontier in support of the invaders vanguard, this concentration could not be bombed -until in due course,.it had actually crossed the frontier. If it should happen that the invading force was driven back over the frontier,  and if by some mischance some bombs were drooped on the retreating forces on the wrong side of the frontier, the State which in the first    instance had been invaded would be subjected to unrestricted air bombardment by all other European air forces.    If, for example, Germany should overrun the French system of frontier fortifications, and French aircraft were to endeavour to stem by bombing the advance of German columns when about to emerge from German territory, are -we to be pledged to use our air forces to bomb the Fr en ch.8. It is not clear what effect the proposed rule would have on naval warfare in Europe.      Would fleets be immune from air bombardment if within the three mile limit of their own coast, but exposed to air attack anywhere on the high seas beyond that limit4? Or is it intended that bombing carried out beyond the three mile limit or sea frontier should be an act of &quot;air aggression&quot;.      In either case the proposed prohibition is beset with anomalies and artificialities which take no account of realities.
i on10 sWhat is to he the situation of a country menaced with starvation as the result of blockade by warships and submarines? Is it intended that the warships and submarines should be immune from air attack in some waters and not in others?     They are presumably to be immune from attack if within three miles of their own coast.      Are they also to be immune from attack unless within three miles of some other country&apos;s coast?     Are countries to be debarred (but only in European waters) from employing their coast defence aircraft to bomb the warships and submarines of an investing fleet wherever they may be located?9.        The adoption of this proposed prohibition would place us and other European States in an extremely embarrassing position as regards our defensive arrangements in peace.      If we did not maintain bombing aircraft we should not be able to honour our obligations to intervene against an air aggressor, and should be at a grave disadvantage if, as would certainly happen,   Lhe prohibition was violated.10,      Is there not in addition a risk that this rule may be denounced as an attempt to make Europe a safe preserve for military aggression and adventure on land - an area in which the history of the last war may repeat itself?      Does not the observance of this rule attempt to set back the hands of the clock while disregarding the fact that every Nation will possess tne unrestricted means of aerial bombardment and yet refrain from using their aircraft except upon its own territory?     Are we to sanction the re-creation of a German air force pledged in advance to the execution of unrestricted aerial bombardment if bombing should occur anywhere in Europe &quot;beyond a frontier&quot;? Are the present frontiers of Europe a satisfactory touchstone for determining the release of unrestricted air bombing?
Finally,  is it desirable or in. the interests of Europe, that there should be any recognised and. valid excuse for subjecting civilian populations to the consequences of unrestricted aerial bombai^dment?effective reply can be made if there were a demand to have tiie plan extended to countries outside Europe?     On what principle can we justify retaining, the power to bomb across a frontier in Asia, Africa, or America,  if such bombing is &quot;prohibited&quot; in Europe?     The idea of having one regime for Europe and another for the rest of the world seems both im-practicable ana inaefeasible.      Yet the extension of the plan to extra-European countries would be fraught with danger. if for example, we had to intervene again in Egypt, China, Persia, Iraq or Arabia to save the lives and property of British and other European nationals, we should find ourselves debarred from bombing though the enemy would have a perfect right to bomb us,lid.        The problem of air disarmament presents difficulties which are met with in no other sphere of disarmament.      All aircraft are susceptible to use as &quot;bombers&quot;, and it is there-fore impossible to abolish the means of aerial bombardment. No good purpose is served by disregarding or endeavouring to circumvent these fundamental facts.      The air menace, like the menace of war itself,  cannot be disposed of by proclamation or prohibition.      In the proposal under review the massed menace of unlimited bombing potentialities is ranged against the in-fraction of an anomalous, regional, and artificial rule.      There can be no moral sanction behind a rule which, without regard to circumstances and on a &quot;regional&quot; basis, makes the bombing of a tank, a submarine - or any other military objective - an international crime.      Yet, the penalty for infraction is to be11.Turning now to the implications of the proposed rule as affecting extra-European countries and circumstances.What
1883the most deadly, devastating, and destructive which can be organised aggression by land or sea, of campaigns conducted with every circumstance of brutality and illegality,  including chemical and bacteriological warfare, blockade and starvation,would indeed receive the assistance of civilized nations in the obliteration of their victim if the latter&apos;s aircraft were to attack even the military forces of their aggressors &quot;beyond a frontier&quot;.      Apart from its disastrous consequences, and the anomalies of its application, no such rule could stand the test of war;    nor can it be supposed that,  in fact, the sanctions behind it would ever be put into operation.13.        If in the event of failure to get an agreed Disarmament Convention on the lines of the present British proposals, His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to go forward with an Air Convention the Air Ministry would again represent that no satisfactory measures of air disarmament can be reached - no &quot;race in armaments&quot; can be avoided - except on tie basis of the numerical limitation of the national air forces of all the leading, air Powers, and the restriction of their use to military objectives only.      The present proposal is not only impracticable and detrimental to our essential interests, but will do nothing to facilitate the limitation of air    armaments (or the restriction of German air rearmament), while it would not afford to the civil population any protection against aerial bombardment,, but on the contrary inevitably expose them to the full effects of unrestricted bombardment by air forces upon whose size and potentialities no limit is proposed.conceived.No such penalty is contemplated in the case ofterror and incendiarism.The pexpetrators of such outrages(Intld.)
