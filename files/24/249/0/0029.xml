SCHEME FOR THE CARRIAGE OF FIRST-GLASS MAILS BY AIR, Memorandum &quot;by the Board of Trade.At the Fourth Meeting of the Committee on Commercial air transport held on the 11th May, it was agreed -(c) to ask the President of the Board of Trade to arrange for a memorandum to he submitted by his Department dealing with the position of shipping under this scheme and the point that, on broad general grounds,  it is most undesirable that there should be any reduction in existing Empire shipping facilities and schedules; this memorandum to be circulated to the Cabinet concurrently with the joint memorandum of the Air Ministry and the General Post Office.20 The Board recognise that progress in the means of transport cannot be retarded hy considerations of the claims of those services which more modern methods tend to replace,,     Nevertheless the position of shipping,  in connection with the proposals submitted in the    joint memorandum of the Air Ministry and the General Post Office, appears to require special consideration,, (The shipping industry has not been consulted in connection with the preparation of this memorandum).50 The scheme involves the withdrawal from the shipping-companies of the first-class mails between points served by Imperial A.irways, leaving second-class mails and parcels still to he carried &quot;by the shipping companies and also first-class mails to destinations not served by the air mails.     The withdrawal would apparently not take place until 1937.4, The shipping companies affected hy the scheme are -&apos; Present mail subsidy.p0 &amp; 0.

5. The first-class-mails form a very small portion (weight or volume) of the total mails including the parcel mail carried &quot;by the shipping companies concerned so that their withdrawal would represent only a very slight increase to the commercial freight oarning space of the ships affected,,60  The present payments to the shipping companies are made subject to stipulations as to the frequency of service, ports of call and speed of the vessels to &quot;be employed,  and are not merely payments for the space occupied on board by the mails.7. The mail services maintained by the companies concerned are briefly as follows: -The P. &amp; O.  S0N. Company run weekly mail services from London and Marseilles to Port Said, Aden and Bombay and vice versa, and a fortnightly service which in conjunction with the Orient Company gives a weekly mail service to Australia and vice versa.The Orient S.N. Company maintain a fortnightly service from London to Australia and vice versa.The Union Castle Mail Steamship Company run .a weekly service of mail steamers from Southampton to the Cape.8. The Board of Trade is of the opinion that any reduction of these services would enable subsidised foreign shipping to make still further inroads into the trade held by British ships and might seriously affect the number of passengers carried and the British trade to the L-ast, Australia and South Africa in those kinds of high class goods which depend on frequent and regular sailings of liners.     It would also lower the prestige of British shipping in trades in which hitherto it has occupied a dominating position.This opinion is supported by the Dominions Office, which takes the view that &quot;the effect on British shipping companies, especially those operating to South Africa and Australia, would undoubtedly be serious j&quot;   by the India Office^ which takes the
view that &quot;longer voyages and a less regular service would cause &quot;a good deal of Inconvenience and might have the result of &quot;diverting a great part of the passenger traffic to the subsidised &quot;Italian Line;&quot;    and hy the Colonial Office, which takes the viewthat &quot;if these services were curtailed, there is little doubt &quot;that the shipping companies&apos; foreign competitors would obtain &quot;more of the existing trade, especially, perhaps, to the iilast &quot;African Colonies, that all Colonial trade is dependent upon the &quot;adequacy and regularity of steamship services, and that much of &quot;the trade,  especially perishables, such as fruit, depends upon &quot;the rapidity of those services.     Any step which would tend to &quot;diminish the volume, regularity or rapidity of existing steamship &quot;services would he open to objection as definitely harmful to &quot;Colonial trade.&quot;9. The financial position of the three companies is such that the withdrawal of payments for mail services could not fail to have serious results involving the restriction of services and the consequent loss of trade to foreign subsidioed competitors.     The P. &amp; 0. S.F. Company&apos;s last published balance sheet shows a   net receipt from voyages of 51,102,000, whereas the normal depreciation of the fleet amounts to 51,264,000.     The ships are not, therefore, paying their way and the loss of 5295,000 mail -subsidy, or of any considerable proportion of it, would very much worsen the position. The Orient li.N. Company&apos;s operating profit amounted to 5321,000 against depreciation of 5819,000.     Any considerable decrease of mail contract payments now amounting to 5150,000 per annum would obviously, therefore, he a serious blow to the Company.The Union Castle Steam Navigation Company showed a profit on voyages of 5336,000 after providing for depreciation, administration expenses, etc.       The mail contract payments of 5170,000 are an important item to the Company&apos;s receipts.
Board of Trade,S. V/. 1. 30th May, 1934,-4-10. It seems clear,  therefore, that, if the shipping companies are to maintain their present Empire shipping facilities and schedules, and preserve their position in the face of subsidised foreign competition they must receive payments for the carriage of second-class mails and parcels of amounts substantially on the same level as those they receive at present for all mail services. It may he necessary to make some readjustment of the present Incidence of cost of the subsidies as &quot;between the United Kingdom, India, the Dominions and the Colonies, in view of the fact that such payments would not he in respect of first-class mails and the financial interests of the different parts of the Empire in the payments might not be the same as they are at present.     The division of the total payments would he a matter of negotiation &quot;between the parts of the Empire concerned.
