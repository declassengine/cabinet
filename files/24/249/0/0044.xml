:0.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). p      C R S T,C A B I N E T,HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT IN GOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS,REQUEST FOR A REDUCTION TO 40 HOUES PER WEEK. Memorandum by the ChanceIlor of the Exchequer.1, The Trade Union Side of the Joint Co-ordinating Committeefor Government Industrial Establishments has asked for a meeting of the Committee to consider a claim for the reduction of the hours of Government Industrial Employees generally to 40 per week without reduction    in wages.2. The direct cost of the change ( 3^ million) represents a fraction only of the total burden that would fall upon the Exchequer;    apart from secondary effects, such as cost of increased accommodation and plant a concession of this order to industrial staff could not fail to re-act upon Post Office Manipulative Workers, and probably also on certain civil service office staffs.        The Postmaster General, after consultation with the Trade and Employment Committee, has already informed the Union of Post Office Workers that for his part he could not contemplate the heavy increased charge involved by the change; and in the absence of any indication that outside industry generally is prepared to contemplate such a change,  it would clearly be inequitable so to favour the relatively few persons in Government employment at the expense of the general body of taxpayers.3. Apart from this so lerge a discrepancy between GovernmentIndustrial Establishments and outside industry (which would be inconsistent with the Fair Wage policy as hitherto administered)
would give rise to many practical difficulties and would &quot;be very hard to justify.    To take the step of reducing hours in Government establishments closely allied to the Engineering Industry in the face of the course of recent discussions within that industry on this very problem could not fail to provoke serious industrial unrest.40 In these circumstances I propose to instruct the government representatives on the Joint Co-ordinating Committee to inform the Trade Unions that the Government cannot accept the claim put forward for the reduction of hours of Government Industrial employees to 40 per week, the main grounds of rejection being(i) The claim as put forward by the Trade Union Sideis in effect not so much a claim to share available work among more workers, as a claim for a substantial reduction of hours combined with the maintenance of present earnings.      it is in effect a wage claim involving increases in the time and piece rates of wages,(ii) Such increases would not be based on thecircumstances of the various establishments or on the position in comparable work in outside industry, but would be arbitrary in character,, For example, a workman whose present working week is 48 hours would have his hourly rate increased to 48/40    of the present figure:    in the cases of 47 hour and 44 hour men the new rate would be 47/40 and 44/40 respectively of the present rates.    This would mean differing percentage increases in the rates, regardless of merits, as the more the present hours were shortened the greater percentage addition v/ould accrue to the workman&apos;s rate.
(iii) There is no evidence that comparable outsideindustries are at present prepared to contemplate such a change and the adoption of the proposal would &apos; put the Government service very markedly out of step with outside practice in the matter of rates of wages paid to the various categories of workmen, (iv) It would not be equitable to place upon thecommunity in general the heavy additional burden of expenditure involved in order to benefit Government industrial workers in the manner suggested. A reply on these lines involves no conflict with the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government at Geneva, but simply recognises that in the long run employment depends on costs of production, and that, up to the present,  there has been no proof that costs in the industries represented in the industrial establishments of the Government would not &quot;be so inflated by the reduction in working hours proposed as hopelessly to cripple this country in the world&apos;s markets.(Intld.)      N.C.Treasury Chambers.20th June,  1934.
