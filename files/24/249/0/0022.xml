THIS DOCUIVIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERIMSNT.CABINET.RET.154(54).UNEIglOmENT   BILL: DATE OF OPERATION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE BOARD.Copy No.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.     It is anticipated that the Unemployment Bill will receive Royal Assent at the end of June, and the Unemployment Assistance Beard will be appointed early in July.    The Board does not take over the work until two Appointed Days, the first Appointed Day being the date from which the Board takes back from the Public Assistance Authorities the duty of administering transitional payments, and the second Appointed Day the date from which the unemployed persons now on poor relief will be transferred to the Board.    It is from this second day that the financial relief to Local Authorities contemplated by the Bill will come into operation, and the Local Authorities are, therefore, pressing for the Appointed Days to be made as early as possible.Owing to the volume of work, it is necessary, for administrative reasons, to leave an interval of 8 weeks between the first and second Appointed Days. 2.     Under the Bill the Board has to submit to the Minister of Labour the draft Regulations within four months from the date of their appointment.   These Regulations, which will determine the standard of assistance to be given &quot;by the Board, will obviously be of great political importance and will require very careful consideration by the Cabinet before they are submitted for the approval of Parliament.    The Regulations must, therefore, be completed by the Board and submitted to the Minister not later than the beginning of November. It has been suggested, however, that the work should be speeded up sc that the Regulations can be presented to the House when it meets in the second week of October in order that the first Appointed Day may be early in November, and the second Appointed Day, when the relief to the Local Authorities will take effect may be not later than early in January.3.     I recognise that there are obvious advantages in fixing the Appointed Days as early as possible, but there are certain important considerations on the other hand which I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues.1.
4 n !T 14 04.     The importance and independence of the Board has been emphasised repeatedly in the House.    The Regulations of the Board are likely to create some difficulties in the House of Commons, and I think those difficulties would be increased if a suggestion could be made that the Board had either produced their proposals without a full and proper examination of the problem in the various localities or that the Regulations had in fact been prepared in advance by the Departments for the endorsement of the Board.    Sufficient time should, therefore, be allowed to enable the Board to make a thorough survey of the whole problem before submitting their Regulations, and an extra month or six weeks will make a considerable difference to the opportunities that the Board will have of studying the situation especially having regard to the fact that a considerable part of the intervening period falls within the holiday season.5.      If the Board are required to complete their examination of the problem and to submit Regulations :fo tame for the first Appointed Day to be fixed early in November, the Regulations would have to be completed and submitted to the Minister of Labour before the end of September.    He will then have to submit them to the Cabinet %vho will wish to consider carefully.   This will probably entail several meetings of the Cabinet or of a Cabinet Committee appointed for the purpose and it may be difficult to secure that the Regulations will be ready for presentation to Parliament by the middle of October. 6.     Further, if the Regulations come into operation   in November, it is obvious that any part of the Regulations which is disliked by Labour opinion will be used in the municipal elections at the beginning of November, and on other political grounds I am not sure that there is net much to be said for bringing the Board into operation after rather than before Christmas. 7.     In addition to these general arguments there are strong administrative reasons for giving the Board a longer period for the creation of their local organisation.    Some 1,500 to 2,000 permanent staff have to be selected and appointed, a number of whom will be drawn from the experienced staffs, of the Local Authorities.    Premises have to be taken in some 250 places, Appeal Tribunals have to be constituted, a certain number of work centres must be organised for the cases of special difficulty, and care must be taken that the staff after having been appointed have received the necessary
I i 0instructions and understand the difficult problem with which they are faced.    None of these things can begin until the Board is appointed, because the staff is appointed by the Board.    I do not suggest that it would be absolutely impossible to create the necessary organisation between July and November, but I am certain that it will be very difficult, and that there is a real risk that the organisation may prove rather incomplete and weak during the first critical weeks in the administration, with possible breakdowns in the machinery of relief.    It must be remembered also that there are a number of important administrative details to be settled with the Local Authorities and that they are in vacation during the whole of August and part of September.    In making these observa-tions, I am of course aware that the preparatory work for the Board is already well in hand, but much of it cannot begin to be put into effect until after the Board&apos;s appointment.8.      So far as the Local Authorities&apos; financial position is concerned, I do not think they would have good cause for complaint if the Appointed Days are deferred.    The depressed areas have been promised that the special depressed area grant will in any case be continued until the second Appointed Day, and there is no case on merits for giving the other areas any financial assistance in anticipation of the relief that they will receive as from that day.9.     Having regard to all these considerations I believe that it would be preferable to make the first Appointed Day fall somewhere in the second week in January and the second Appointed Day 8 weeks later.      I should, however, like my colleagues to consider this and to come to an early decision.(Intld.) H.B.11th May, 1934.
