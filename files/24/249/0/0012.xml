THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted;for-theCabinef.,,,May, 1934.,u,;, f;)SECRET.Copy No.CP. 124 (34).CABINET.53TITHE RENTCHARGE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. IN accordance with Cabinet 19 (34), Conclusion 8, I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a statement of the position with regard to the Tithe Bill, now awaiting discussion in Committee in the House of Lords.2. The considerations which led to the drafting of the Bill in the form approved by the Cabinet on the 28th March (Cabinet 13 (34), Conclusion 8) are set out in my Memorandum CP. 75 (34). The Bill contains provisions (Clause 1) for enabling relief to be obtained in cases where tithe rentcharge is heavy in comparison with the annual value of the land in respect of which it is payable; and (Clause 2) for providing further facilities for the recovery of tithe rent-charge, the present procedure having proved so ineffective in many cases as to bring the law into contempt.3. The Bill has been put forward, not as a final solution of the tithe problem, but as a &quot; reasonable contribution towards meeting present-day difficulties &quot; (CP. 75 (34)). Neither this, nor any other Bill which the Government could be expected to introduce, would satisfy the extremists among the tithe agitators, whose frankly avowed objective is to cancel, in whole or in part, their tithe obligations whether by expropriation of the titheowner or by subsidy from the general taxpayer. It was hoped, however, that the Bill would attract the support of the large body of moderate opinion which exists in such bodies as the Central Landowners&apos; Association and the National Farmers&apos; Union, and enable them to dissociate themselves definitely from the extremists.4. This object has not been achieved. The Bill was given a Second Reading in the House of Lords by 45 to 17, but it has not been favourably received by moderate tithe-paying opinion. Strong objections in particular have been raised to Clause 2, under which tithe rentcharge would be recoverable as a personal debt (as well as from the land as at present), and the demand for a general enquiry has, at the same time, become very vigorous.5. In my Memorandum CP. 75 (34) I said (Paragraph 8) : &quot;In view of the comparatively short period which has elapsed since the passing of the Act of 1925, I am not satisfied that a case has been made out for an enquiry into the whole question.&quot; The reception of the Tithe Bill by the Central Landowners&apos; Association, the National Farmers&apos; Union, and the Conservative Parliamentary Agricultural Committee makes it evident that pressure for such an enquiry is so strong that it will be extremely difficult for the Government to resist it, with or without the Tithe Bill.6.   The following courses are open for review : (i) Proceed with the Bill, without enquiry, (ii) Withdraw Clause 2 of the Bill and announce an enquiry.(iii) Withdraw the whole Bill and announce an enquiry.(iv) Refer the Bill to a Select Committee pending a decision on the questionof holding a wider enquiry. &quot; &apos;:&apos; (v) Proceed with the Bill on the floor of the House and announce an enquiry.[10002]
27.   Course (i) does not now. appear, to be. practicable.Course (ii) would, in my view, be highly undesirable. It would destroy the balance of the Bill and the Government would be open to a charge of breach of faith with the tithe-owners.Course (iii) would be a great surrender to agitators. It would not only involve loss of prestige to the Government, but there is every reason to believe it would encourage intensification and -spread of resistance during the holding of the enquiry.Course (iv) was, I. note, considered at some length when the subject was discussed by the Cabinet on the 2nd May. It would, for the time being, avoid the difficulties of the situation. I would urge, however, that it should not be adopted. The step would indicate hesitation on the part of the Government. The grounds on which the Bill is being opposed are generally known, and an enquiry under Select Committee procedure into the two specific proposals in the Bill would necessarily be so restricted in scope that it would merely cause irritation, prejudice the prospects of the Bill, and intensify the demand for a general enquiry. The subsequent announcement of a Commission would look like continual yielding to pressure. If, as I trust my colleagues will agree, it is now expedient to grant a general enquiry, there are great advantages in making the announcement as soon as possible and using what would be a concession to the opponents of the Bill to facilitate its passage.Course (v) I strongly recommend should be adopted. The present situation offers an opportunity of linking up a measure of relief with a reform in the law of recovery which is clearly desirable, not only in the interests of tithe-owners who find themselves unable to recover just debts, but, as the Lord Chancellor said in his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill, in the interests of &quot; the maintenance of law and order in our country.&quot; It may be urged that the Bill prejudges to some extent the result of an enquiry. It must be remembered, however, that the main question in respect of which an enquiry is most strongly demanded is the 1925 &quot; settlement &quot; a matter which is not within the scope of the Bill now before Parliament. The enquiry will, in fact, if it is to be of any value at this stages; have to deal with far wider issues. I have consulted, confidentially, repre-sentatives of the principal tithe-owners Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Welsh Church Commissioners and the University Colleges-on the subject, and they advise me that, if the Government decides to institute an enquiry, they would much prefer the Bill to be proceeded with, notwithstanding the concessions which Clause 1 involves. They share the fears expressed above as to the serious consequences of proceeding with an enquiry without the Bill.As events have already shown, it is extremely difficult in dealing with a subject of such acute controversy as tithe to forecast opinion in Parliament or outside, but I am encouraged to hope that the adoption of Course (v) would be the best means of meeting the present difficult situation.8. The scope of the enquiry, the status of the Commission, and its personnel; will need most careful consideration. I will, if desired, put forward proposals on these points, but for the purpose of an announcement oh the Committee Stage of the Bill in the House of Lords it should be sufficient to give an assurance that the Government will endeavour to obtain the services of men of the highest standing, and that the terms of reference will be such as to enable them to consider the question in all its aspects.SUMMARY.9. The demand for a general enquiry intb tithe rentcharge has sb intensified since the introduction df the Tithe Bill that, ill my vieW, it Will prove tb be extremely difficult to resist, whether the&quot; Bill is proceeded with or riot.Opposition to the Tithe Bill in Parliament is likely tb be considerably reduced by the announcement of an enquiry.The withdrawal of the Bill, whether accompanied by an announcement of an enquiry or not, would lead to intensification and spread of the agitation.I strongly re^oirimehd that the Gdvernihent should, oil Gbttimittee Stage of the Bill in the House tif Lords, announce its decision to Set u  an enquiry -with wide terms bf reference, and proceed with the Bill.-y-uiJoit&apos;!
