THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1934.SECRET. Copy No. CP. 137 (34).CABINET. i Q_ &quot;      laPROPOSED EUROPEAN CONVENTION AGAINST air bombardment.1. I HAVE mentioned this proposal more than once, and in view of the urgent situation which will arise if, on and after the 29th May, it is manifest that general disarmament agreement is impossible, I have asked the Prime Minister to permit this Paper to be circulated at short notice.2. My proposal would be a convention to be signed by the States of Europe undertaking not to drop bombs from the air on one another&apos;s territory, whether in peace or in war. Other areas might hereafter be disposed to negotiate a similar convention, but I would limit our proposal to Europe because otherwise delay must arise, e.g., in bringing in the Far East. It leaves &quot;police bombing in outlying areas &quot; untouched. Moreover, a European convention will not involve Dominion agreement. Also, if the proposed convention is limited to Europe, it might be negotiated outside the machinery of Geneva. Only in this way can Germany be brought into conference, and it is essential that she should be a party.3. I would add to the convention a sanction in the form that if any party violates the agreement, the other signatories undertake to employ their air forces to vindicate the convention and to restrain the wrongdoer. In plain English, I would provide for a general bombing of the State which breaks the convention by dropping bombs. This is a drastic process, but, admittedly, the only way in which a State can be restrained from bombing its neighbour is by fear of the consequences, and the consequences must take the form of reprisals. Indeed, I do not know what our bombing force in England is for, unless it be, in certain eventualities, to bomb other people. It is, no doubt, true that air reprisals might involve a general state of war, but we have to face this unless we prefer the alternative of doing nothing to prevent bomb dropping.4. I annex a Memorandum by Lord Stanhope which works out some of these ideas in more detail. The main thing, however, is to get Cabinet attention for the general idea. While I circulate Lord Stanhope&apos;s suggestion for more detailed machinery, I am myself rather inclined to prefer a general covenant to concentrate air forces on the wrongdoer rather than clauses to provide for enquiry and report. The essential thing is speed in the reprisal, and I fear that enquiries make for delay.5. It may be said that such a convention, though applied to all Europe,, would, in the end, only result in reprisals being undertaken by France and our-selves. The smaller neighbours of Germany probably have no bombing machines,, and in any event would not risk the dangers of tackling a first-class State. It may be so, but even if France and ourselves were the principal States to take action against Germany, one might expect Poland to join in, and in any event the result would be that co-operation between France and ourselves which must occur if German aggression moves westward, but which cannot be provided for in advance by an Anglo-French alliance.J.

M emorandum.1. The chances of obtaining agreement to a general disarmament convention appear small. It seems, therefore, advisable to see if something can be saved from the wreckage. The danger from air attack is that most apprehended by the general public in most countries, and&apos; particularly in the United Kingdom. If, therefore, a scheme can be devised by which this danger can be minimized, not only will the Disarmament Conference be saved from complete failure, but the League will escape from a serious loss of prestige.2. Various schemes have been considered to minimize the danger of air attack, but no solution has been found which seems likely to be effective. Prolonged discussion has taken place at Geneva in regard to the qualitative limitation of aircraft, and also to the abolition of military aeroplanes. It has, however, come to be realised that any aeroplane can carry a bomb, and that the abolition of military aircraft is more of a danger than the reverse, unless civil aircraft can also be placed under complete control.3. Any scheme, to be effective, must be such that a nation which resorts to it is likely (1) to suffer more than it will gain; (2) to have little hope of delivering a knock-out blow before retaliatory action is instituted. Further, the scheme must not endeavour to undertake more than is practicable, nor must it impose such burdens on participating nations that they would be unlikely to shoulder these burdens when the occasion arose.4.   The following scheme is therefore suggested : (a) All European nations shall be invited to sign a pledge not to drop in Europe from any aircraft any bomb or any substance of a deleterious character, whether solid, liquid or gaseous. Such pledge shall cover a discharge, whether over land or sea. For this purpose Europe shall be defined on a map attached to the convention showing the seas which it is intended to include.(&amp;) Any nation which suffers injury at the hands of another nation consequent on a breach of the pledge in (a) shall report the fact immediately to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. It will also supply him with a report drawn up after investigation by a committee of military experts previously appointed in the capital city of each nation by the foreign missions there appointed.Note. The proposals for &apos;&apos; Committees of Verification &apos;&apos; made in connexion with the Disarmament Convention might form the basis of the necessary provisions.(c) If the enquiry establishes the fact that injury has been suffered as the result of action in breach of the pledge, the guilty nation shall be given twelve hours within which to apologise. In this event the case will be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice to assess damages.(d) If the nation accused denies the charge it shall, within the above-mentioned twelve hours, agree to submit its case for judgment to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and both the accused and the accuser nations shall pledge themselves to abide by the judgment. If the Court finds a breach established it will assess damages.(e) If a second air attack is made, or if the guilty nation refuses to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d), the Secretary-General shall proceed to institute the action laid down in the succeeding paragraph.(/) All nations who sign the agreement, if the nation that has suffered is one of the signatories, shall provide personnel and aeroplanes (with the necessary escort of fighter planes), who shall bomb the guilty nation until it appeals for an armistice.   Any targets, civil or military, shall be engaged.(g) Nations in the neighbourhood of the guilty nation shall provide the necessary aerodromes and accommodation for the air forces of participating nations.(A) Any nation which does not sign the agreement shall be liable to the sanctions imposed in paragraph (/) if it commits an infraction of paragraph (a). It shall not, however, receive assistance if bombed by another nation, since it has itself undertaken no obligations.(i) Each national air force shall act under its own commander, and shall bomb the targets most suitable from a strategical and geographical standpoint
loto the aerodromes to which it has been allotted. General direction of the operations shall be entrusted to a committee to be set up at once by the Powers participating in the action.(j) When a guilty nation sues for peace bombing shall stop. The terms of peace shall provide for the compensation to be made by the guilty State, the amount of such compensation, if necessary, being assessed by the Permanent Court of International Justice.(k) This agreement shall not be abrogated by any act of war either on land or sea. If a nation at war breaks the pledge in clause (a), it shall still be liable to the sanctions of clause (/).(Z) This agreement is confined to European nations. A European nation, however, shall be free to join a similar agreement in other continents should it so desire. The details of the present agreement shall be worked out amongst such European nations as express a willingness to consider favourably the signing of such a convention.   (The meetings shall be held at The Hague.)5. It will be recognised that the proposed agreement sketched out above deals only with one part of the armaments problem, but it deals with that part which appears to civil populations to be the most threatening to their own security. Any mitigation of this threat increases the sense of security which is the key of the disarmament problem.6. It is proposed that the scheme shall apply only to Europe, as it would -clearly be impossible for European nations to apply air sanctions in (e.g.) South America, or vice versa. Moreover, as the delegates to work out the details of the plan would be drawn from European nations only, the personnel of the Conference would be different from that of the present Disarmament Conference, which could thus close down. It is suggested that the new Conference should meet at some place other than Geneva to which the Germans would probably refuse to come, and perhaps The Hague or Brussels would be preferable to London. By confining the scheme to Europe we are able to continue bombing for police purposes on the North-West Frontier or in Iraq.7. The sanctions proposed are of a most drastic character. To prevent a nation, however, from undertaking air action against another nation sanctions must be such as more than to counterbalance the temptation to engage in this form of warfare. The gain to the United Kingdom of such a convention should prove adequate to satisfy those in this country who are opposed to any further commitment. It should at the same time satisfy those who are pressing for collective action. It does not prevent the air strength of this country from being increased, and it does not get us into difficulties either with the United States or with our own Dominions.8. The sanctions are confined to a specific act and they have been made as automatic as possible. The security of sanctions is nullified if the word &quot;if&quot; is introduced, as nations are then left in doubt as to whether the sanctions will, in fact, be put into operation and whether they can be relied on. The machinery to bring the sanctions into operation, although apparently somewhat complicated on paper, should work with great rapidity an essential condition if sanctions are to be effective, and more particularly where air action is involved.9. The scheme will no doubt meet with difficulties. Small nations might refuse to provide aerodromes, as in 4 (c/), through fear of punishment at the hands of a powerful neighbour. This difficulty might be met by participating nations agreeing under certain circumstances to free a small nation from such an obliga-tion. Germany may claim that if she signs she should at once be allowed to possess military aeroplanes a request to which France would object. It can, however, be pointed out to Germany that she forfeits the right to ask for sanctions if she does not sign and that she can fulfil her quota of bombing planes from her large civil aviation. It could further be pointed out that this convention is in no way connected with the limitation of arms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The arguments against such a scheme, however, appear somewhat insignificant corn-pared to the increased sense of security which would be engendered if the plan *could be put into execution.Foreign Office, May 11, 1934.
