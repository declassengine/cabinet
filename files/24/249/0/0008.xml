As I promised at the meeting of the Cabinet on 25th April (Cabinet 17 (34) Conclusion 15) I am circulating a short statement for the information of my colleagues showing the effect of the Unemployment Bill, as amended in Committee, upon the rates of unemployment insurance benefit and upon transitional payments which are assessed according to need.     The note has been agreed with the Chancellor.^*       Unemployment benefit tb.tes.As from the 1st July the unemployment benefit rates in operation before they were reduced by the economy measures in October, 1931, will come into force again.Principal Present Rates.

Of the unemployed persons on the register at the end of March 42 per cent, were claimants for insurance benefit. 3.     Extension of Benefit period.By the operation of the extension of the period of benefit for those with a good contribution record, which is proposed in the Bill, the number of persons at any time eligible for insurance benefit may be increased by about 140,000 on a register of 2,200,000.     This will be the increase on any one day, but the number of persons who will have the advantage of this extension will in the ooursej of a year be very much larger, about 650,000..   Both the increase of benefit rates and the extension of the period during, which persons may receive benefit are possible owing to the improved financial position of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.The cost to the Insurance Fund in a full year will be -Increase of Benefit.   Extension of period. Assumed Register of 2,200,000  4,800,000  7,000,000&quot; &quot; &quot;    2,300,000     -.  5,100,000  7,500,0001.
The amount of transitional payments is limited &quot;by statute to the amount of benefit which v/ould have been received if the applicant had been entitled to benefit.     If, therefore, the assessment of need by the public assistance authority comes within the benefit rate it is met entirely out of transitional payments, but if it exceeds the transitional payment then the applicant can apply to the public assistance authority to make up the difference.The effect of the Unemployment Bill is to increase benefits and consequently to increase the amount payable as transitional payments and chargeable to the Exchequer.     Consequently, if needs continue to be assessed as they are, the only difference would be a transfer of certain charges from rates to the Exchequer.     But in practice, there is no doubt that there will be very considerable increases in the amounts paid to the able-bodied unemployed in two ways.     Applicants whose needs justified, on the looal authorities standards, an assessment higher than the maximum benefit rate were compelled to apply to the public assistance authority if they wanted supplementation, but in many cases they have not done so.     They will now get the benefit of the extra transitional payment to which the new provision will entitle them without the necessity of applying to the Poor Law for supplementa-tion.     In other cases where the assessment ma.de by the publd o assistance authority v/ould have been higher but for the limit of the benefit rate, it can now be increased.It will be seen that while there is no automatic increase in transitional payments in each case, (and care should be taken not to make any statement which could be so interpreted),    there is no foundation for the suggestion of Labour Speakers that the concession is a sham.     What the extra charge on the Exchequer will be cannot be estimated with accuracy, but it may be worth noting that the sum of  3,600,000 which has been reserved for the purpose for nine months is equivalent to  4,800,000 a year in a full year, and that is not very different from 10$ of the present cost of transitional payments.(intd.)
