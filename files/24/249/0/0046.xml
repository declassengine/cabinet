MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT0 )CABINET.REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE.NOTE BY THE PRIME MINISTER.I circulate some notes, which have teen prepared hy the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, on the recommendations contained in the Report of the Select Committee on Procedure of the House of Commons (1932).I also submit,  for the consideration of the Cabinet, my recommendations in the form of aB RET.159(34).draft Answer to a Parliamentary Question.(Intld. ) J,H4M,10 Downing Street, S.W.18th June, 1934.
Notes by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury on Recommendations contained, in Report of Select Committee on Procedure.(House of Commons Paper No.  129 ________of 1932).__________Estimates Committee (page 12 of Report).The first recommendation concerns the Treasury in the first instance and relates to the Estimates Committee, which the Procedure Committee seek to strengthen and make more effective.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Governments decision on this recommendation on May 2nd 1933.The Reports of the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees are rarely discussed by the House mainly because no demand has been maoe for such a debate, or if a demand has been made the Government has refused it on grounds of pressure of public business.      The Procedure Committee recommend that at least three&apos; of the Allotted Supply Days should be set aside for a definite consideration by the House of those Reports. The work of the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees is germane to the Business of Supply and there would appear to be no objection to their Reports being taken on Supply days. Prom many points of view it would be a distinct advantage for the Reports to be discussed by the House and would tend to enhance the control of the House itself over details of expenditure.      The definite allocation of three of the twenty allotted days for tnis purpose is,, however, excessive.The setting asiae of one allotted supply day would be sufficient, with perhaps a provision to enable a further day to be devoted for this purpose if required.      The mort-gaging of one out of twenty Supply days would not entail any great hardship on the Opposition or limit to any great extent their right to choose subjects on these days;    and the pro-posal has the merit that the Reports could be debated within the normal time which must be allowed for Supply and. would not
require the allocation of a day out of ordinary Government time.Another method to secure time to debate the Reports of the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees would be to. give power to the Chairman of Ways and Means to bring on any particular report for discussion at 7.30 one evening on the analogy of the power which he now possesses to find time for the consideration of opposed Private Bills.      In this case the Chairman of Ways and Means would be the sole judge as to whether or not there was a general demand amongst Members for such a debate - a duty which he might feel too invidious in view of his position in the HouseeChairman of Standing Committees (page 13).Select Amendments (&quot;Kangaroo&quot;)  should, be conferred on all Chairmen of Standing Committees.      Tiie Procedure Committee consider that the modern practice of sending nearly all Bills upstairs demands the granting of this power and they are ap-apparently content that it should be given without any alteration in the present method of appointing members to act as Chairmen of Standing Committees.In evidence given before the Committee Mr.  Speaker, Sir Herbert Samuel, Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Mr.  Kennedy (then Government Chief Whip) advocated wider powers being given to Standing Committee Chairmen;    Sir Bolton Byres Monsell was against an extension;    Mr,  Baldwin considered the granting of such power undesirable;    Mr.  Lloyd George thought it a mistake that the power was not given in 1919 when the number of Standing Committees was increased.      Mr.  Speaker considered the grant of the power a natural corollary to trie modern practice of sending bills upstairs, and the Clerk of the House advocated it with certain conditions as to length of notice of amendments.Thesecond major recommendation is that pov/er to
The power of Selection of Amendments throws a heavy responsibility on the Chair and doubts have been -expressed as to whether such power should be conferred on a Chairman of a Standing Committee who has not trie training and experience possessed by the Chairman of Ways and Means or Deputy Chairman;    and v/ho has not the detached position in so far that, a 1though   the two Chairmen in the House are party appointments, after election they abstain from ordinary party conflict,,The suggestion has been made that in order to bring the position of a Chairman of a Standing Committee more into line with that of the Chairman of Ways and Means, five paid posts (one for each Standing Committee)  should be created and that the holders should abstain from party action after their election.      Quite apart from the question of the creation of new posts,  there would probably be  the objection that 7 constituencies instead of 2 (as at present) would to all in-tents and purposes be disenfranchised.Another suggestion is that the Speaker would be the best judge of Members possessing the required qualities and that he should appoint a panel of Members to act not only as Chairmen of Standing Committees but as Temporary Chairmen of Committees in the House when requested so to do by the Chairman of Ways and Means.      In this way training and ex-perience in the House could be obtained and the appointment by Mr. Speaker might commend itself to those who otherwise might feel a distrust of the judgment and impartiality of a particular Chairman of a Standing Committee,The granting of this power would be helpful to the Government ana consequently weaken the Opposition.      If a measure is hotly contested in a Standing Committee, the
This proposal was made by Sir William Graham-Harrison as a time-saving expedient. He thought that in the case of Bills whose main object was the expenditureGovernment has its remedy by bringing the bill back to the floor of the House.If the power of Selection is to be granted, it ought to be accompanied by a change in the method of appointing the. Chairmen of Standing Committees and there is much to commend the suggestion that the Chairmen should be appointed by the Speaker.      This does not involve any criticism of the Committee of Selection who appoint the Chairmen&apos;s panel.      The change in the method of&quot;appointment seems a necessary counterpart to the grant of additional powers to Standing Committee Chairmen and might tend in some way to create more confidence in their impartiality.      The scheme could be tried as an experiment , a Sessional Order being-passed for- the purpose.Other recommendations.Financial resolution (page 13) .That financial resolutions should be taken after the Second Reading of Bills involving expenditure of public money except in the case of Bills originating in Committee of Ways and Means  (i-e. , Finance Bill and Consolidated Fund Bill), provided the Government has the right to proceed by way of preliminary resolution if desired.
money resolutions, there was a tendency for two secondreading debates to take piece;, in so far that the debate on the Committee stage of the money resolution coversexactly the same ground as the second reading of thebill3 and that consequently there was an unnecessaryduplication of  debate-.     In the opinion of parliamentary counsel it was much more satisfactory for the House tosee the proposed bill and debate the money resolutionafter the second reading, and Sir William took the viewthat the real object behind the procedure of moneyresolutions of concentrating attention on the financial aspect would still be accomplished and the Chair would find it easier to confine the debate on the financial resolution to the expenditure side of the question.The adoption of this proposal is contrary toStanding Order No.  64:-&quot;That this House will not proceed upon anypetition, motion, or bill, for granting any money, or for releasing or compounding any sum of money owing to the Crown, but in a committee of the whole House.&quot;This Standing Order was passed in 1707 and has never been altered.      The present practice acts as a check on expenditure and secures first and foremost a debate on the financial aspect of a measure.-      The acceptance of this recommendation would have the semblance of weakening the control of the House of Commons over expenditure and for this reason its adoption would seem to be inexpedient.It is undoubtedly true that in the case of bills v/hich must be founded on money resolutions there is a duplication of debate.      The Chairman, not having the text of the bill before him, is at a disadvantage in
keeping the debate on the committee stage of the money resolution within its proper limits, and members find difficulty in appreciating the full extent of the particular proposal from the outline contained in the money resolution.These difficulties might be met and duplication of debate avoided to some extent if, without altering the present procedure, the customary white paper issued explanatory of the effect of a financial resolution could contain a draft of the clauses of the bill which would be introduced subsequently.      The Chairman would be in a better position to decide the scope of the debate on the money resolution and members would have before them a complete picture cf the Governments proposals.Que st ions :    (page 14) .Ho interference with the present arrangements with regard to Questions is proposed.Ministers are under no obligation to give replies to unstarred Questions on the day they appear on the Order Paper for answer.      There have been complaints by Members of unjustifiable delay in giving answers to written questions. The Committee thinh that this fact causes many Questions not of general interest to be put down for oral answer in order to secure an early reply, and to avoid this the Committee propose a new class of Question for written reply to be distinguished by a dagger.      This would indicate that an early reply was desired and Ministers would be under an obligation to reply to such Questions as expeditiously as if they were starred.In some cases delay in answering Questions whether they are unstarred or starred is unavoidable.
The Committee&apos;s suggestion might he given a trial unless it is considered advisable to endeavour to place Departments under the obligation to reply at due date to all unstarred Questions.      This might be brought about by a personal letter from the Leader of the house to all Ministers.guillotine (page 14).The Committee are agreed that &quot;although the use of the guillotine in modern conditions is inevitable the Kangaroo closure is preferable&quot;.      The &quot;Kangaroo&quot; closure or the power of the Chair to select amendments is in force all the time and guillotine resolutions are only proposed when the normal exercise by the Chair of this power 5 as well as ordinary closure moved from the Treasury bench, has failed, or when the Government has reason to suppose before the Committee stage of a bill is begun that such power will be inadequate to secure its passage by a certain date.      It is pointed out that in either case the ordinary closure can be used:    that it is simple to apply the closure when the kangaroo is in operation, but that &quot;a sense of grievance is always aroused when the closure is applied under the guillotine&quot;. Of course a guillotine is closure by compartments and a Government knowing that a certain clause or certain clauses v/ill be obtained at a stated hour never has any need to apply the closure within the compartment. The Committee recommend that if the Guillotine is to become the regular method with all Bills, and not the exception, a more scientific method must be devised for
giving   ample time for every point of substance to be discussed and they propose a small expert Committee to which the Bill should be referred by vote but without debate, after the motion referring the Bill to a Committee of the whole House has been passed.      They further recommend that the allocation of the time for the Report stage should not be made until after the Committee stage is finished and assume that the time-table would be drawn up after consultation with the Government, the Opposition, and other Members specially interested in the Bill.The Prime Minister in evidence favoured a guillo-tine for all Bills taken on the floor of the House as a normal procedure.      Mr.  Baldwin, Mr. Lloyd George and Sir Bolton Eyres Honsell were against the use of the guillotine becoming part of the normal procedure.The setting up of a Business Committee to decide on the allocation of time for a bill has been advocated before by Mr. Asquith, who was strongly of the opinion that the guillotine was a necessary instrument of Parliamentary procedure, and by Sir Austen Chamberlain. Mr.  A. J.Balf our in giving evidence before the Procedure Committee of 1913-14 did not think that such a Committee would serve any useful purpose.The Commi11 ee&apos;s recommend at ion is dependent, upon the guillotine becoming part of the normal procedure, and is not suggested as an expedient to be used the: next time a Government proposes a time-table motion.      In fact the Committee propose that official sanction should be given to a practice which is growing up when a
guillotine is found necessary of consulting the Opposi-tion parties through the usual channels as to the best distribution of the time available for the various stages. This course was successfully adopted in regard to the Ottawa Agreements Bill, 1932, but of course there nave been, and no doubt will be again, instances where the opposition to a measure is so strong that   a party is unable openly to negotiate with the Government on the question of time.      It is however true to state that in recent years, after a guillotine motion has been passed, the Opposition, however much opposed to the particular Bill, has settled down to operate the time-table to the best general advantage.(This note was written some time  ago and while true up to Session 1932-55, it must be qualified in so far as the Unemployment Bill of the present Session is concerned.      However, there is much to be said for the view that the experience of the working of the Time-table on the Unemployment Bill does not mean that the Time-table procedure has broken down.      The Opposition parties were taken into consultation and they even complied with the Governments invitation to submit their ideas as to the arrangement of a time-table within the number of days allocated.      These draft Time-tables were reconciled with the Government&apos;s draft.The bad working of the Time-table Motion on the Unemployment Bill was   really caused by the nature of the Bill.      It was a Bill which affected every constituency.      Members supporting the Government had their points to put and the Opposition lost the control of the debate and the prominence for their amendments, which they usually obtained when a Bill raising only an issue as between Parties had been guillotined).
Closure,  (page 14).No general alteration in closure procedure is pro-posed but the Committee express the opinion that the power to claim &quot;that the Clause down to word &quot;so and so&quot; stand part of the Bill&quot; might be abolished,     &quot;This power is rarely ex-ercised on the floor of the House, but- has been used oc-casionally in Standing Committee.      It was used in Standing Committees during 1927 and 1931 when the Cinematograph Films Bill 1927,  the Audit Bill, 1927, and the Consumers Council Bill 1931, were under consideration.      They were all contentious bills and the comprehensive closure is the only power to counter obstruction.      The Committee has not made any substantial case for its abolition.Standing Orders (page 14).A small technical committee is proposed to be nominated by Mr.  Speaker to revise Standing Orders some of which are obsolete or require amendment.Mr.  Speaker nominated such a Committee in March 1933 and the amendments recommended by the Committee were passed by the House in November 1933.Departmental Rules and Orders,   (pages 14-15)Recommendation that the attention of the house should be called to the laying of rules and orders on the Table by the Clerks reading out the titles immediately after Private Business on the next sitting day after they are laid.It seems doubtful whether any useful purpose would be served &quot;by adopting this proposal.     A large number of these orders are presented and the reading of their titles (a laborious task for the Clerk of the House) might well become an encroachment on the &quot;Question hour&quot; which Members would deplore.
The Donoughmore Committee on ministers Powers makes recommendations towards improving the machinery of the House of Commons regarding all statutory rules and orders, and the matter is letter left until the Government considers the Bonoughmore Report.Sitting of Standing Committee during the Sitting of the House. Ipage 15JTRecommendation to re-introduce the old rule that Standing Committees should not sit during the sitting of the House without special leave of the House.Difficulties in regard to Standing Committees sitting in the afternoon and evening when the House has been considering important business have arisen in recent sessions, but they have generally been overcome by amicable arrangement in the Committee and by Ministers in charge of Bills undertaking not to ask the Committee to sit in the afternoon and evening on days when the House was to con-sider any particular business of general interest.If it is the desire to make the Parliamentary machine more efficient, to accept the recommendation would be a retrograde step and impair the usefulness of the Standing Committee system.Private Members&apos; Rights,  (page 15). Recommendations:1. That Private Members should be allotted the first half of a day in each week until Whitsun,  the Government taking the second   half of the day.In the first place,  it is difficult to see how any Government could agree to its business being relegated to the second half of a sitting with all the risks attendant on securing an adeuqate attendance of its supporters.      If the....V     ... . ...,v::... &apos;.&apos; :   ...  ;.     &quot; ......     \., .
old idea of half-days for Private Members is to be reverted to, it should be a complete reversion with Government business occupying the time till 7.30 p.m. and.Private Members1 motions from 7,30 p.m, onwards.The change from two haIffdays a week to one whole sitting for Private Members&apos; Motions was made in 1927 as a result of a recommendation of a Select Committee.      This Committee was really set up to consider the hour at which Private Members&apos;  time should begin, because 8.15 p.m. was felt by many Members to be an inconvenient hour for the break, especially if one or two divisions resulted on the interruption of business.      In the last Parliament it was found that the Wednesday sitting was treated as an &quot;off&quot; day by Members, that the attendance was poor;    that the House was generally listless, and that occasionally the House was counted out.      Evidence was given before the Committee urging that the whole day for motions should be done away with, as not being in the best interests of Private Members of Parliament.In the last Parliament there was evidence to support this view, but in the present Parliament such evidence is lack-ing.This is largely a new House and perhaps an abnormal Parliament.      In the first session the Government took the whole of Private Members&apos;  time and Members felt little or no resentment at this in view of the emergency situation with which the Government was dealing.      The Session of 1932-33 is therefore the first time that the bulk of the House has had experience of the facilities accorded to Private Members. The debates on the Wednesday motions so far have been well attended and interesting and have dealt with topical subjects. A count has not been attempted.      The same is true so far as the present Session, has proceeded.
There is no immediate case for a change and it would he wiser to lay aside this recommendation.As a matter of fact the proposal of the Committee to allow half a day each week until Whit sun would give Private Members time about equal in amount to that which they now enjoy for Motions.2c No alteration In the arrangement of Fridays is suggested but it is proposed that the Committee of Selection should have power to review the progress made or likely to he made by Private Members&apos; Bills and to give precedence on Standing Committees to such bills as seem likely to command general assent.A Private Members&apos; Bill commanding &quot;general assent&quot; is presumably a non-contentious bill and bills of this nature can always get through.      If, however,  the Committee of Selection is to review the position and prospects of all private Members&apos; Bills, an invidious task is set them and its practicability is doubtful.Daily Adjournment.The Committee agree with Lord Winter-ton&apos;s suggestion that a full half-hour&apos;s discussion should be provided whenever a Member has the opportunity of raising a matter on the adjourn-ment of the House previous to half-past eleven.The Committee is not very explicit.      Lord Winterton really urged that f hour should be allotted to the motion &quot;That the House do now adjourn&quot; and that at the end of that time the adjournment should be automatic.      He appreciated that it might entail the rising of the House at a later hour.      The chief objection to this proposal is that the House would not favour a later hour for the automatic adjournment of the House. If the normal hour of Adjournment is still to be maintained at
11.30 p.m. Lord Winterton&apos;s proposal could only be put into effect by bringing forward, the hour on interruption. This would curtail the tir.e for Government Business. -Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act (page 15).The Committee, while recognising that Church measures vary greatly in the public interest they command,  suggest that a limited number of Government Fridays should be set apart for the consideration of those measures,  in respect of which the Committee of Selection may decide that there is a demand for discussion, and that then the particular measure should be taken as first order.Mr.  Denman was in the main responsible for this recommendation.      It seems safe to assume that Church measures raising important issues will be bound to receive special consideration by the Government in arranging time for their discussion (e.g. prayer Book measure).(INTLD.)

PROCEDURE    COMMITTEE. Draft Answer in reply to Question.The Select Committee on Procedure of this House which sat in Sessions 1930-31 and 1931-32 under the Chairmanship of my Hon. Friend, the Member for Leith (Mr. Ernest Brown), took a great deal of evidence and the Government is indebted to the Rt. Hon.  and Hon. Members in the previous and the present Parliament who devoted so much time and care to their enquiry.      The Committee presented to the House a most useful Report and after consideration of weighty evidence came to the unanimous opinion that &quot;the procedure of Parliament is sufficiently flexible to meet all the demands made upon it.&quot; The Government have given most careful consideration to the recommendations which the Committee made and I propose to circulate in the official Report the decisions to which the Government have come.The chief recommendations of the Committee refer to the Estimates Committee and the work of Standing Committees. The Government propose to accept the recommendation that greater pov/ers should be conferred upon the Chairmen of Standing Committees by giving them the power to Select Amendments, and will propose, as a necessary corollary to the acceptance of this recommendation, the appointment of a panel of Members to act both as Temporary Chairmen of Committees of the Whole House and Chairmen of Standing Committees.      Mr. Speaker has consented to appoint this Panel.The Government consider that the grant of greater powers to the Chairmen of Standing Committees and the change in the method of their appointment are important improvements in procedure which will make for the more efficient working of the Standing Committee system.
The following is the statement to be - circulated in the Official Report.RECOMMENDATIONS.Estimates Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on May 2nd, 1953,  in reply to a question put by the hon. and gallant gentleman the Member for Chelmsford, the action proposed by the Government on this recommendation, so far as it relates&quot; to the work of the Estimates Committee.The Government is in sympathy with the suggestion that opportunities should be provided for discussion by the House of the Reports of the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees, and propose that the Standing Orders should be amended in order to allow of the Reports of the Estimates and Public Accounts Committees being considered on one of the Allotted Supply Days,  if desired.Chairmen of Standing Committees.The Government are in favour of giving the power to Select Amendments to Chairmen of Standing Committees, but they consider that in view of the responsibility which the grant of this power entails, the method of appointing Chairmen of Standing Committees should be altered.      It is proposed that Mr.  Speaker should nominate at the beginning of every session a panel of not more than ten Members to act both as Temporary Chairmen of Committees and Chairmen of Standing Committees.     Mr. Speaker has consented to nominate the panel of Members.The change in the method of appointment of the Chairmen and their interchangability as between Committees of the Whole House and Standing Committees will,  it is hoped, enable the Members of the panel to gain more experience in the
conduct of proceedings in the House which will better fit them to discharge their duties in Committees upstairs.recommend at ions on Minor matters. P i n an c i a 1 E e s o 1 u t i on s.The procedure which involves proceeding by way of preliminary resolution is an old one and concentrates attention on the financial aspect of any legislative project.The Government, while appreciating the suggestion that, in the case of Bills founded on money resolutions, there is a tendency towards the duplication of debate on the Committee stage of the preliminary resolution and on the Second Reading of the Bill, is not in favour of any proposal v/hich might tend to weaken the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure.It is proposed, however, that in the case of Bills founded on money resolutions (except Bills originating in Committee of Ways and Means)  the proposed draft clauses of the Bill should be printed whenever practicable in the White Paper which is issued explaining the effect of the money resolution.The Government hope that this proposal, by providing Members with full information as to the scope of the money resolution and the proposed clauses of the Bill, will go some way towards avoiding duplication of debate.Questions.Mr.  Speaker has been consulted on this recommendation and is of the opinion that a new class of Question for written reply to be distinguished by a dagger when a Member desires rapid information might prove confusing to the House. The Government do not therefore propose to accept this r e c recommend t i on.
As a general rule Ministers endeavour to reply expeditiously to Questions for which a written answer is required, but it will be appreciated that where detailed information is sought a slight delay is sometimes unavoidable .Guillotine.The Government in fixing the terms of the Time-table motion for the Committee stage of the Unemployment Bill, 1954, took into consultation the Opposition Parties and Members specially interested in the Bill.      It is the intention of the Government to follow that course in the future when a Time-table motion is applied and to adopt, as an experiment, the suggestion that the different clauses and stages of a Bill should be allocated by a small Committee within the time available for the discussion of the particular measure.Closure.The Government do not propose to accept this recommendation.Standing Orders.Mr. Speaker nominated a small Committee to revise the Standing Orders and the Amendments proposed by the Committee were passed by the House on the 14th November, 1933Departmental Rules and Orders.The Government do not consider that the reading by the Clerk of the House after Private Business of the titles of Rules and Orders laid on the Table would serve any practical purpose.
Sitting of Standing- Committees during the Sitting of the House.The Government feel that the question whether a Standing Committee should sit while the House is sitting is one best left for the Standing Committee itself &quot;to decide.Private Members&apos; Rights.i. In the opinion of the Government there is no general demand for an alteration in the allocation of time for Private Members&apos; Motions.     During the present Parliament debates of great value have been initiated by Private Members on the Wednesdays set apart for Motions.     /jibe attendances of Members have been good, and on no occasion has the House been counted outjj7     In view of recent experience the Government consider that the present arrangements for Private Members&apos; Motions, which were made in 1927,  should be given a further trial.ii. While the Government are in favour of Private Members making full use of the opportunities available to them to promote legislation, they feel that an invidious duty would be placed on the Committee of Selection if they were given power to review the progress made,  or likely to be made, by Private Members&apos; Bills with a view to determining-precedence on the Standing Committees.iii. The Government do not consider that the proposal to allow a full half-hour&apos;s discussion whenever a Member has the opportunity of raising a question on the Adjournment previous to half-past eleven o&apos;clock is practicable.Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act.The Government cannot accept the recommendation toset aside a limited number of Fridays for the discussion ofChurch Assembly Measures. As the Committee point out, such
Measures vary in importance and in the opinion.of the Government sympathetic consideration would always be given to any substantial demand made for discussion at a reasonable hour of a Measure raising issues of great public interest.The proposed Amendments to the Standing Orders to give effect to the changes will be placed on the Order Paper.-SO-

NetREPORT
REPORTThe Select Committee appointed to consider the Procedure in this House in regard to the Conduct of Public Business and to suggest any changes that may seem desirable have agreed to the following Report : 1. Your Committee were appointed this session to complete the work of the Select Committee on Procedure on Public Business which sat during a greater part of last session, but was unable, through pressure of time, to make a report. The published evidence of the former Committee was referred to Your Committee ; and, although Your Committee are smaller in number and not identical in personnel with the former Committee, they propose, for the pur-poses of reference in this Report, to assume that the evidence given before the former Committee was given before them. The Coni-mittee of 1931 had 28 sittings, of which 25 were for the purpose of hearing evidence. The witnesses examined included Mr. Speaker, the Leaders and Chief Whips of the three Parties, 11 other Members of the House, the Chairman of the Estimates Coni-mittee, one other witness who had previously been a Member of the House (though he gave his evidence \as an expert in political institutions), and certain official witnesses including the Clerk of the House, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury. Your Committee have only felt it necessary to supplement this evidence by hearing the present Chairman of the Estimates Committee, and two official witnesses with regard to the working of the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act.2. Your Committee recognise that one of the chief reasons for their appointment was the existence of a large body of criticism of Parliament, both by Members and by representative citizens, and they have interpreted their terms of reference in a broad sense.The problems with which Your Committee have been confronted are not new, nor are they confined to the House of Commons. They present themselves in almost every elected assembly in all countries where modern views as to the powers and duties of the State are finding expression, and where the vastly complicated social, industrial, commercial and economic questions of our time are demanding parliamentary attention and. solution. These problems made themselves felt in the House of Commons soon after the passing of the Reform Act of 1832. During the last century numerous Committees, on which the most experienced parliamen-tarians of their day sat, have considered the practice and procedure cost of printing and publishing this Report is estimated by the Stationery Office at  9 2s. 6d.
of the House of Commons&apos;, and alterations have regularly been made in the forms and rules of Parliament, nearly all of which have reduced the opportunities of the private Member and increased the powers of the Executive, in order that the House of Commons might be enabled to grapple with the ever-increasing volume of official business with which it was called upon to deal.3. The criticisms which have been made fall mainly into two categories: First, those which refer to the need for relieving Parliament of part of the business which clogs its machinery; Second, those which are aimed at an actual amendment of the procedure of the House of Commons so that it may be able to do more legislative work in the time at its disposal, and to increase its efficiency as a critical and controlling assembly.Some of the witnesses held that the House of Commons seemed to occupy a slightly lower place in the esteem of the people than it did in other days. Attention was called to the fact that its proceedings are less fully reported, and that the frequency of obstruction and of the use of the closure to overcome obstruction have reduced the value of the debates and affected the quality of the legislation, while also lessening respect for a body which is alleged by these critics to waste time in unprofitable wrangling.4. Your Committee were limited by their terms of reference to the consideration of the procedure on public business ; and they have, therefore, only admitted evidence relating to changes in wide and ultimate constitutional principles in so far as these might affect the procedure of the House. Certain proposals were made by witnesses which involved the whole structure of Parliament and its relations to the Cabinet, to the party system, and to the complex industrial and economic organisation of our time.These proposals seemed to Your Committee to have been in-adequately considered, both in themselves and in their relations to the procedure of Parliament. They did, however, show that it is not simply the procedure of this House that affords what grounds there are for many current criticisms of Parliament, such as the allegations that Parliament is congested, that there is insufficient time for all the work legislative, administrative and financial, that the Standing Committees so pre-empt the attention of Members of Parliament that they vote on the resolutions of the Chamber in ignorance of the issues, and that the operation of central and local administration is not adequately checked because Members have neither the time nor the expert knowledge to examine it in detail. These criticisms arise rather from opinions concerning the functions of Parliament that are by no means universally accepted, such as the view that Parliament is primarily a machine for pour-ing out large annual masses of legislation.Suggestions were also made for devolving certain functions to national Parliaments other than this House, and for abolishing the power of dissolution so that the House of Commons might sit for17069 A 2
a fixed number of years, regardless of what might happen to any particular Government during that period. Such recommendations are among those which involve changes in the constitution rather than the procedure of the House of Commons, and though Your Committee admitted evidence on these points, in order to find out whether, in the view of the witnesses who made them, much of the congestion of the House of Commons would be relieved by such changes, it would have gone beyond their terms of reference to make recommendations on these constitutional questions.5. One major cleavage is apparent in the evidence given before Your Committee, namely, between the witnesses who desired the machinery of the House of Commons to be altered in favour of the majority, and those who expressed keen feelings as to the position of minorities in the House of Commons, and who held that the increasing power of the Government of the day over the time of the House of Commons was rendering the position of a private Member of Parliament less attractive than it used to be to many who would be useful Members of this House. Several witnesses criticised the present procedure as not sufficiently reflecting the need to restore to some extent the independence, authority and interest of the private Member. Your Committee realise that the principle of majority rule is a fundamental convention upon which all Parliamentary government is built, but that this must collapse in proportion as the principle of the protection of minorities begins to decay. They would urge, therefore, that any rules and Stand-ing Orders which may be adopted must depend for their success upon the prevalence of the feeling of good will amongst all Members who have to work under them. Your Committee, in this connec-tion, desire to call attention to the following passage from the report of the Select Committee on Public Business which sat in 1848 :-&quot; It is not so much on any new rules, especially restrictive rules, that Your Committee would desire to rely for a prompt and efficient dispatch of business by the House, but increasing business calls for increasing consideration on the part of Mem-bers in the exercise of their individual privileges. Your Com-mittee would desire to rely on the good feeling of the House, on the forbearance of its Members, and on a general acquiescence in the enforcement by the Speaker of the established rule of the House which requires that Members should strictly con-fine themselves to matters immediately pertinent to the subject of debate.&quot;Your Committee would urge that unless understanding and a common loyalty prevail there will be a danger of the collapse of the system of representative government. The procedure of the House of Commons is an expression of these ideas ; and congestion in the order of business is, as it were, a political pressure gauge indicating the tension in the Parliamentary machine.   If the principles of
equality among Members, publicity of the House&apos;s proceedings, freedom of speech, majority rule, or the right of the minority to nn adequate expression of opinion are consciously challenged, there is an indication of some serious defect in the life of the nation. These larger considerations cannot be regulated by rules and orders : they are the responsibility of each Member of the House.Your Committee, after consideration of all the evidence laid before them and in view of the experiences of the last 12 months, are unanimously of the opinion that the procedure of Parliament is- sufficiently flexible to meet all the demands made upon it. This opinion is confirmed by the weighty evidence given by Mr. Speaker last session and by the letter from him reported in the first question of this sesskm&apos;s evidence, in which he wrote : &quot; Dear Mr. Brown, I am quite ready to appear again before the Procedure Committee, if they wish me to do so, but I feel I could only confirm the evidence that I have already given which, in my opinion, has been substantiated by the course of the proceedings throughout the present Session.&quot;.6. Your Committee&apos;s recommendations, therefore, deal only with the rules and machinery needed for the carrying on of Parlia-mentary work. They have borne in mind that, wherever a repre-sentative assembly acts as a healthy and vigorous organ of govern-ment, its regulations and forms must be such as, while permitting adequate debate and giving adequate powers of initiative to its individual Members, will assist the Executive in providing with regularity and celerity for the vital wants of the State.Much of their time has been given to an examination of the problem of obstruction. The present formalities of legislative pro-cedure in the House of Commons manifestly afford much oppor-tunity of debate. It cannot be surprising if, in times of excitement, when measures are actively opposed, these opportunities are in danger of being abused. Such an abuse is recognised as obstruc-tion, and is denounced, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without reason, if the resistance to legislation is obstinate. Your Committee have found it difficult to obtain a definition of &quot; obstruc-tion &quot; from the witnesses, for it is recognised that, when a project of legislation is brought forward with little or no warning, embody-ing a novel policy, and containing provisions which have not under-gone public discussion, there may be adequate grounds for delay. The mind of the nation may be unenlightened, and its judgment unknown, as to the value of a particular measure. In such a case a repetition of hostile argument in debate may be a public duty, such as it is the particular function of an Opposition to discharge. Such debates, however, easily pass- beyond defensible limits, specially in Standing Committees, when the same Member may make a number of speeches on the same issue. When the conduct of an Opposition degenerates into a determination to use all the forms and privileges of procedure to prevent a Bill passing, not
because it is new and strange, or not understood, or not approved by the nation, but simply because it is disliked by those who are opposing it, the offence of obstruction is developed, and no machinery that has yet been devised can operate successfully, if good will in its working is absent. But Your Committee makr recommendations for increasing the powers of Chairmen of Stand-ing Committees, so that the opportunities for obstruction may be limited.7. The general nature of the evidence invited will be seen from the two questionnaires, Appendices I and V, to the Minutes or&quot; Evidence taken before the Committee of last Session (No. 161, 1931), which were submitted to witnesses. In deciding to limit the evidence to that which would be based on a personal experience of the procedure of this House, Your Committee were guided by their terms of reference, and by the consideration that any criticisms of the present practice, or suggestions for change, could not have much weight unless they were based on such experience. At the same time they are convinced that, in the course of the evidence given before them, every aspect of possible criticism was brought out by witnesses, some of whom criticised the present procedure very severely and proposed drastic changes.The answers to the questions submitted to witnesses may be summarised as follows : (a) Criticism of present procedure in general.Although nearly all the witnesses admitted that some criticism was justified, some went very much further than others. The crucial deviation on this head reduced itself to a divergence of opinion as to the function of Farliament. Those who considered its primary function to be that of a national forum where great issues were debated, or should be debated, were more concerned with the revival of this function than with the increase of Parlia-mentary legislative efficiency; while those who considered its fnnc-tion to be that of a legislative machine, or a body7 charged with the control of expenditure and of Departmental action, were anxious to make far-reaching changes in procedure in order to improve the performance of these functions by the House.No witness went so far as to recommend a radical reconstruction of the whole system, but, whereas Professor Muir wished to revert to what he called &quot; the system of parliamentary supremacy,&quot; Sir Oswald Mosley desired to reduce Parliament to the position of a jury to which the measures of a small junta should be submitted for a simple verdict of &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no.&quot;The reforms advocated by other witnesses in general reduced themselves to constitutional changes, such as a sub-Parliament for industrial and economic questions (a proposal elaborated in some detail by Mr. Winston Churchill), or some measure of devolution
to other bodies, or to a system by which numerous small Standing Committees of the House should strictly examine and control the expenditure and action, if not. the policy, of the Departments.(b) Criticism of the House of Commons&apos; control over expenditure.Grave criticisms of the working of Parliament were contained ii; the evidence of many witnesses who expressed dissatisfaction with the methods by which the House of Commons attempts to control expenditure, and Your Committee make recommendations in order to meet these criticisms.(c) Suggestions for reforms of detail.(i) General distribution of time spent on stages of Government Dills on the floor of the House. The evidence relevant to this subject resolved itself into suggestions for the improvement of the guillotine resolutions on .Government measures by such means as the setting up of a standing consultative committee. Certain witnesses thought that no committee stage should be taken on the floor of the House, but others held that the guillotine should not be applied invariably, or only after a period of unrestricted debate. Lord Eustace Percy put forward a scheme for the complete alloca-tion of time throughout the session. This was the only concrete proposal which met the contention made by many witnesses that shorter sessions were desirable in the interests both of the House as a whole and of individual Members.(ii) Standing Committees. The witnesses who advocated the w ider extension of the committee system on the foreign or municipal pattern naturally inclined to the abolition of the present Standing Committees of large numbers, and to the transference of their work to a number of small departmental committees, which would involve a&apos;new system. Other witnesses, who were not in favour of this change, favoured the conferring of greater powers on the Chairmen of Standing Committees, especially with regard to the power of selecting amendments.(iii) Private Members&apos; time and facilities. As to this problem there was a divergence of opinion, some witnesses taking the extreme view that all private Members&apos; time should be taken away and given to the Government, while others criticised the want of opportunity afforded to private Members under the present procedure. Mr. Lloyd George suggested that a Government draftsman might be put at the disposal of the promoters of the first 10 Bills successful in the ballot, while other witnesses pro-posed the abolition of the ballot, or the modification of its action. Lord Winterton was in favour of giving private Members three-quarters of an hour every night after the &quot;business of the day in order that they might be able to raise points in which they were interested.
(d) Questions of financial detail.Witnesses of the different parties concurred in the opinion that the present debates on Supply were ineffective, and suggested their abolition, or an alteration of the rule that only questions of administrative detail can be discussed on the Estimates. Several witnesses were in favour of an alteration in the powers of the Estimates Committee, in order that a larger measure of control over expenditure might be secured.(e) Supervision of Departmental rules and orders.Several witnesses raised this question in view of the growing number of rules and orders, and although Your Committee did not exhaustively consider this subject pending the publication of the Report of the Departmental Committee on Ministers&apos; Powers (Cmd. 4060), they make a recommendation for calling the House&apos;s attention to the laying of all such rules and orders on the Table of the House.(f) Questions.It was generally agreed in the evidence that the present hour for Questions was enough. Various witnesses put forward views regarding Supplementary Questions and the possibility of the in-creased use of unstarred Questions. It was pointed out that the difficulty existing at present was that there was often delay in answering unstarred Questions. Only one witness desired to abolish Questions : other witnesses wished to limit further the number of Questions and/or to limit Supplementary Questions that a Member might ask on one day.(g) Otlier opportunities of criticism.There was no marked agreement on the only subject discussed under this head, which was the efficacy or inefficacy of private Members&apos; Motions.(h) Rules of Debate, Guillotine.The view of the Prime Minister was that a guillotine resolution should become a normal procedure, but that the framing of it should only be settled after consultation with a panel or consulta-tive committee. This met with a good deal of approval, but Lord Eustace Percy expressed the opinion that a timetable resolution for Bills not introduced before the 1st March should not be allowed.8. Three major issues emerged from the evidence : (1) The advisability and possibility of shorter sessions; (2) The problem of the Standing Committees; (3) The practice of financial control.
With regard to the advisability and possibility of . shorter sessions, Your Committee conclude that this depends upon the willingness of Governments to adopt a settled and limited pro-(tramme of Parliamentary work. They are of the opinion that much obstruction, which arises from uncertainty as to the allocation of time during a session, and gives rise to attempts on the part of the Opposition to prevent undue legislation, would be avoided if the length of Parliamentary sessions were fixed and if a time-table allocating business were adopted. Evidence was given that unduly protracted sessions were detrimental in many ways.It was urged (a) that the debating power of Members becomes stale; (b) that if there were fewer debates there would be greater public interest; (c) that the long session tends to discourage many representative men and women who have other interests and duties from seeking membership of the House; (d) that the strain placed upon the technical staff tells heavily against good draftsmanship and intelligible legislation; and (e) finally that too great a. burden is placed upon Ministers and Members of Parliament and upon the Departments concerned in the legislation of a protracted session.With regard to the problem of the Standing Committees, the issues raised included the following : (a-) should any change be made in size or numbers?(b) should any new system of departmental committees be attempted? This was urged by more than one witness, and by those who spoke as representatives of the Independent Labour Party.(c) should Chairmen of Standing Committees be given power to select amendments with, or without, Parliamentary notice?(d) should any modification be introduced, such as the insti-tution of drafting Sub-Committees for the purpose of freeing the. subsequent report stage in the House of all merely mechanical proceeding ? and(e) it was also urged that Standing Committees of the House should not sit when the House was in session.Your Committee have carefully considered the evidence given in favour of setting up a large number of committees, which should work on the business of particular Departments, but they are not convinced that these committees would either be sufficiently repre-sentative of the House as a whole to achieve the end desired, or be a sufficient check upon Ministers and Departments to counter-balance the grave disadvantage which would, in their judgment, arise from the delays inherent in the system. They have come to the conclusion that there should be no change in the size or numbers of Standing Committees, but they make recommendations regarding the powers of Chairmen of Standing Committees.
9. Financial Contfol. The problem of financial control was by far the gravest issue raised before Your Committee. Then-was a good deal of evidence on this subject, and a marked divergence of view as to possible changes. There was no difference of opinion as to the failure of previous attempts to secure effective control by the House of Commons over public expenditure, or as to the reasons for this failure.In order to see the problem of our national expenditure in true perspective, it must be realised that there are two classes of expendi-ture, one governed by Statutes and the other by annual Votes, the two classes being respectively known in Treasury language as the Consolidated Fund Charges and the Annual Supply Charges. They are subject to different degrees of control, and this is one of the major difficulties in the way of effective action by the House of Commons. The language used to describe the different charges is confusing even to private Members of the House of Commons. Payments of a more permanent character are described as being made out of the Consolidated Fund, while other payments are described as being made out of &quot; monies provided by Parliament.&quot;The first step which the Government takes, in co-operation with Parliament, to obtain the necessary Supplies for the year is to receive the Estimates prepared by the spending Departments. These are prepared in the autumn, submitted to and scrutinized by the Treasury, and finally approved by the Cabinet, before being published and presented to Parliament. It is in this period of the year that the control of spending should operate. Once the Cabinet has decided to approve the Estimates, Members of the House of Commons are powerless, except verbally, to criticize, save at the risk of defeating the Government of the day.At the beginning of each session two Committees of the whole House are set up the Committee of Supply, and the Committee of Ways and Means. The duty of the first is to consider the Estimates and to vote such grants of money as appear to he required. The second Committee has a dual function : it both authorises taxes and the issue and appropriation of money out of the national till to meet the grants voted by the Committee of Supply.   The latter function is a purely formal one.Your Committee agree with the judgment of the Committee on National Expenditure, 1918, that &quot; The Committee of the whole House on Supply has the name but has none of the methods of a Committee. It was established in the days of recurring conflict between Parliament and the Crown as a device to secure freedom of discussion on matters of finance. The debates - in the House itself were recorded in the Journal, which was sometimes sent for and examined by the King; and they were conducted in the presence of the Speaker, who in.those days was often the nominee and regarded as the representative of the Sovereign.   By going
into Committee under the Chairmanship of a Member freely-selected, the House of Commons secured a greater degree of privacy and independence.&quot;The Committee of Supply is a Committee of 615 Members. They cannot, therefore, effectively consider the details of finance. The time at their disposal is strictly limited. They cannot examine witnesses : they have no information before them but the bulky volumes of the Estimates, the answers of a Minister to questions addressed to him in debate, and such casual facts as some in-defatigable private Member may be in a position to impart. A body so large, so limited in its time, and so ill-equipped for inquiry would be a- very imperfect instrument for the control of expenditure even if the discussions were devoted entirely to that end. But these discussions afford during 20 days practically the only oppor-tunity in the course of the year for the debate of grievances and of many questions of policy. In the competition for time such matters usually take precedence, and questions of finance, especially those affecting the whole field, are crowded out.In these circumstances it is not surprising that in the last 40 years there has scarcely been a single major instance when the House of Commons by its own direct action has reduced, on financial grounds, any Estimates produced to it.Your Committee agree with the Committee of 1918, also, that the presentation of the Estimates serves a useful purpose and,, in that it secures publicity for the sums which they include, fixes responsibility for the expenditure on Ministers and the Depart-ments, and provides an opportunity for a detailed challenge if one is desired.The fact remains that the bulk of expenditure is outside the-control of individual Members of Parliament, except in so far as they can influence policy. This is true of the Committee of Supply, the Public Accounts Committee, and the more recently formed Estimates Committee, of which the last are debarred by their terms of reference from considering questions of policy. It must be realised that the technical work.of control is well done. All Accounts are examined, and, if necessary, reported on, by an officer known as the Comptroller and Auditor General. He is independent of the Executive, responsible to Parliament, and remove-able only by a resolution of both Houses. He is assisted by an examining staff of 230 persons, of whom all but 40 are quartered in the premises of the Departments whose Accounts are audited,, and all of whom are engaged continuously throughout the year in examining the public Accounts. They have direct access to the books and other Departmental records.. The Comptroller and Auditor General is attached to the Public Accounts Committee which carries out a postmortem examination of the Accounts; and this Committee has encouraged successive Comptrollers to go beyond
mere audit and to scrutinise or criticise improper or wasteful expen-diture. It is also the duty of the Public Accounts Committee to report to Parliament, and the reports of this Committee are held .in wholesome regard by the Government Departments. Yet although their reports and the continual scrutiny applied to Depart-mental Accounts by the stall&apos; of the Comptroller and Auditor General do undoubtedly check extravagance, the Estimates for the current year are completely outside their purview.These considerations led to the recommendation that an Estimates Committee should be set up; and, although Your Corn-mittee have no desire to belittle the work being done at the moment by a particularly vigorous Committee, they are bound to record their judgment that, up to the present, the various attempts to make the Estimates Committee an effective instrument for the control of public expenditure have failed. The Estimates Com-mittee have done good work from time to time, but the difficulties in their way arise from the fact that they are powerless to deal with policy, that they do not receive the Estimates in time, that they have no staff adequate to survey the whole field of public expenditure, and that no definite days are allotted for a discussion of their reports in the House.Recommendations .10. Estimates Committee. Your Committee, therefore, make it their first recommendation that the Estimates Committee should be enlarged, and that a close working arrangement should be estab-lished between that Committee and the Public Accounts Coni-mittee. They are of opinion that, while Estimates and Accounts are separate matters, it would be advisable that closer touch should be established between the working of the two Committees. They think that it should be within the competence of the Estimates Committee to take into consideration matters of policy as well as of detail, and that it should be one of their duties regularly to survey the relation of the total public expenditure to the national income. It is obvious that the staff at the disposal of the present Estimates Committee is inadequate to the performance of their responsible duties, and Your Committee have considered how this difficulty could best be overcome. They are not of opinion that this duty should be allotted to members of the Treasury staff. Every Estimate, before it has been presented to Parliament, has already been submitted to the Treasury and passed. Once its sanction has been given, the function of the Treasury must rather be to meet and answer criticism than to stimulate and direct it. Your Committee are quite clear that the effective work done by the Public Accounts Committee is largely due to the fact that they have at their disposal the reports and investigations of the stall: of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. They consider that the Estimates Committee ought to be provided with an official adviser
of the same kind, with similar powers of investigation. They are aware that this is a major departure, but they do not think that any Members of Governments, or of the House, can look back over the last ten yeai-s without desiring to overcome the diffi-culties which have hitherto stood in the way of an effective control by the House of Commons of public expenditure. They need only recall that during this period outside Committees have been set up on two occasions in grave national emergencies to do work which ought to have been done, and could have been done, had the machinery been available, by Members of the House of Corn-mons. On consideration of the evidence placed before them, they are inclined to recommend that the adequate technical advisers for the service of the Estimates Committee should be taken from the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General. They under-stand, however, from the Comptroller and Auditor General that there would be difficulties in carrying out this recommendation, partly on statutory grounds and, more particularly, on the ground that it might complicate the relations between the Comptrollers, staff and the Departments. Your Committee accordingly urge that, if these difficulties prove insurmountable, the Estimates Com-niittee should be provided with an independent technical staff adequate for their functions.Your Committee have also considered the question of the lack of opportunity under present Standing Orders for an adequate dis-cussion of the Reports of the Public Accounts and Estimates Com-mittees; and they recommend that at least three of the allotted Supply days should be set aside for a definite consideration by the House of the Reports from the Committees, whether they cover the whole, or any part, of the annual Estimates and Accounts.11. Chairmen of Standing Committees. Your Committee recom-mend that power to select amendments should be given to all Chairmen of Standing Committees. They are of opinion that the practice of conferring this power on a Chairman of a Standing Committee by resolution in the case of a particular Bill is objec-tionable and, by causing resentment, leads to waste of time. Such resolutions give the impression that the Government of the day desires to push through a particular Bill without full discussion. It is also obvious that, if a Chairman is qualified to exercise this power in one case, he is qualified in all cases. Moreover, in Your Committee&apos;s judgment, the modern practice of sending nearly all Bills upstairs seems to demand the granting of the powers of &quot; kangaroo closure &quot; to Chairmen of Standing Committees.12. There are, also, a number of minor matters of procedure in regard to which Your Committee desire to make recommendations.(i) Financial Resolutions. They agree with Sir William Graham-Harrison that Financial Resolutions should be taken after the Second Reading of Bills involving expenditure of public money, except in the case of Bills originating in Committee of Ways and
wMeans, provided that the right of the Government to proceed by way of preliminary resolution is left unimpaired.(ii) Questions. They do not think there should be any inter-ferance with the present arrangement with regard to Questions -but, recognising that many Questions not of general interest to the House are put down for oral answer in order to save delay in reply, they recommend that a new class of Question for written reply should be allowed to be distinguished with a dagger. This would mark the Question not of general interest with regard lo which a particular Member desires rapid information. Tho Minister should be under an obligation to reply to such Questions as expeditiously as though they were starred.(iii) Guillotine. There were many suggestions as to the guillo-tine, and Your Committee agree that, although the use of the guillotine in modern conditions is inevitable, the kangaroo closure is preferable. It must be remembered that, in either case, the ordinary closure can be used. It is simple to apply the ordinary closure when the kangaroo is in operation, but a sense of grievance is always aroused when the closure is applied under the guillotine. They agree with Mr. Speaker that, if the guillotine is to become the regular method with all Bills, and not the exception, a more scientific method must be devised for giving ample time for even-point of substance to be discussed. If the guillotine is to become normal procedure, they recommend that the time available for discussion of the different Clauses and stages of a Bill should be -allocated by a small expert Committee, to whom the Bill should be referred by a vote taken without debate after the Motion &quot; That the Bill be committed to a Committee of the Whole House &quot; has been carried. Further, they recommend that the allocation of time for the Beport Stage should not be made until the Committee Stage has been^completed. It is understood that the time-table should be drawn up after consultation with the Government, the Opposi-tion and other Members specially interested in the Bill.(iv) Closure.-Your Committee do not recommend any general alteration in the Standing Orders relating to closure, but they are of opinion that the power to claim &apos;&apos; that the Clause down to word &apos; so and so &apos; stand part of the Bill &quot; might well be abolished. It is a power rarely exercised on the floor of the House, though recently it has been used in Standing Committees. It is their opinion that the use of this power always embitters feeling, and in the long run it is very doubtful whether it achieves any saving of time.(v) Standing Orders. Your Committee consider that certain of the Standing Orders are obsolete and should be repealed, and that -others require amendment to bring them into line with present practice. They think it would be advisable that a small technical Committee, nominated by Mr. Speaker, should be set up in a future session to revise the Standing Orders.(vi) Departmental Rules and Orders. Your Committee recom-mend that, attention should be called to the laying of all such rules ;and orders on the Table of the House by the Clerk&apos;s reading out the
titles of such rules and orders, immediately after Private Business, on the Parliamentary day following the day when they were laid upon the Table.(vii) Sitting of Standing Committees during the Sitting of the House. Your Committee recommend that the Standing Orders should be so amended as to reintroduce, so far as Standing Com-mittees are concerned, the old rule that Committees should not sit during the time that the House is sitting without obtaining the leave of the House to do so.(viii) Private Members&apos; Rights. Your Committee were impressed by the evidence that private Members&apos; time is not used under the present Standing Orders to the best advantage, and they suggest, instead of the present arrangement that private Members should be allotted the first half of a day in each week until Whitsuntide, the Government taking the second half of the day. They think this would ensure that, if a private Member is successful in the ballot, the House would be&apos; kept for the discussion of his motion, and they also think that normally one motion per day instead of two should be ample. With regard to private Members&apos; Bills, there was a conflict of opinion between those witnesses who set great store by private Members&apos; Bills, and those who did not; and after reviewing the various suggestions, Your Committee think that the present arrangement of Fridays should remain, but that, as the session proceeds, the Committee of Selection should have power to review the progress made, or likely to be made, by such Bills, and to give precedence on Standing Committees to such Bills as seem likely to command general assent.Your Committee agree with Lord Winterton that the Standing Order regulating the interruption of business should be so amended as to provide for a full half-hOur&apos;s discussion whenever a Member has the opportunity of raising a question on the adjournment previous to half-past eleven at night.(ix) Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act. There were certain complaints made by various witnesses as to the operation of the Enabling Act. It was pointed out that the House of Commons had no power to amend any Bill brought forward under this Act but only to accept or reject, and that, being exempted business, discussions on very important issues contained in past Bills had taken place always after 11 o&apos;clock. Witnesses considered that this did not do justice to the importance of the Measures, nor was it fair to Members of the House who desired to raise issues concerning such Measures.Your Committee recognise that such Measures vary greatly in the public interest they command, and they therefore recommend that a limited number of Fridays should be selected from those allocated to Government business on which Measures in respect of which the Committee of Selection may decide that there is a sub-stantial demand for discussion should be the first order of business.13. The Committee express their indebtedness to Mr. 0. C. Williams, Clerk to the Committee, for his invaluable services.(17069-50)  Wt.     -     1000 11/32  P. St. G. 835
