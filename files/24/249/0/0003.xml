[This document is the Property o  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.SECRET.CP. 114 (34).Copy NoCABINET.CIYII. DISOBEDIENCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR&apos; INDIA.My colleagues have no doubt seen in the Press references to the statement issued by Mr. Gandhi on the 7th April, and I think it may be. of interest if I circulate some further information regarding tbis statement and also as to the line of policy which it is proposed to adopt in the situation now existing.For some time past there had been evidences of a growing desire on the part of several important Congress leaders to free Congress from the incubus of civil disobedience, which they recognised had definitely failed as a political weapon, and to concentrate their energies on entering the Central Legislative and Provincial Councils with a view to opposing Government and in particular the White Paper in this more constitutional manner. To this policy Mr. Gandhi was resolutely opposed, and though various attempts had been made to summon a meeting of Congress leaders to discuss the matter, nothing had come of them, and we had begun to think that the idea was doomed to failure and that Mr. Gandhi&apos;s obstinacy would once more prevail. It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that we learnt that the meeting of Congress leaders which did eventually take place at Delhi just before Easter, and which passed a resolution in favour of Council entry, had been successful in forcing Mr. Gandhi&apos;s hand. When the resolution was first communicated to Mr. Gandhi, he expressed his approval in the following words: &quot; It is not only right, but it is the duty of every Congressman who for some reason or other does not want to or cannot take part in civil resistance, to seek entry and form a combination in order to prosecute a programme which he believes to be in the interest of his country.&quot;His next move, however, was wholly unexpected. On the 7th April he issued a long statement in which he advised all Congressmen to suspend civil disobedience for Swaraj as distinguished from specific grievances and desired that civil resistance should be left to him alone and not resumed by others in his lifetime except under his direction.The statement was interpreted by the Government of India as being, in. effect, a calling off of civil disobedience as definite as could be expected from Mr. Gandhi. They therefore immediately consulted Local Governments as to the policy to be adopted in the event of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s advice being accepted by Congress.The Government of India and Local Governments found themselves agreed that if Congress wished to ratify the change of policy nothing should be done to prevent such ratification, and that whichever of the central organisations of Congress they selected for the purpose should be allowed to meet. With my concurrence the Government of India have already announced in the Legislative Assembly that such a meeting either of the all-India Congress Committee or of Congress as a whole will be permitted.Subsequent action must to some extent depend on the resolution passed by the-central organisation and on future developments generally, but if the change of policy is ratified formally or is without such formal ratification clearly accepted and acted on, there is general agreement between the Government of India and Local O governments (a) that the notifications at present in force proscribing specifically Congress organisations shotild be withdrawn and sequestered property returned, but that the notices in respect of associations proscribed for reasons other than the civil disobedience movement, such as connection with terrorism or communism, should not be withdrawn. Special consideration will have to be given to the Red Shirts in the North-West Frontier Province, who, though for tactical purposes linked with Congress, are a purely revolutionary organisation ;2736      65   4.34
2(b) that there should be no general release of prisoners, bnt that the presentsystem of releasing before the expiration of their sentences persons unlikely to indulge in constitutional agitation should be speeded up. By the end of last month the number of prisoners had already been reduced to about 1,450, of whom over 600 were in Bombay. There is no question of releasing prisoners such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who have been convicted of sedition or of other serious offences ;(c) that in regard to the leaders, Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghafar Khan and dr. Khan Sahib, who are detained without having been brought to trial, developments must be awaited before a decision can be reached. The first is notorious for his connection with agrarian agitation in Gujerat and the latter two for the formation of the revolutionary Bed Shirts ; and(d) that the Government of India and Local Governments should retain thespecial powers obtained by legislation at the end of 1932.I consider that the conclusions of the Government of India and Local Governments on these matters are correct and that they are also right in holding that when the time comes to make an announcement of their attitude and of the action to be taken, the announcement must be framed in such a way as to avoid the possibility of any inference that Congress have done something effective or constructive and come to terms with Government.This is a point on which Local Governments lay special stress, and this con-sideration has weight added to it by certain later confidential information which has just been supplied to me by the Government of India. This information goes to show that the Delhi meeting was really representative only of those Congress leaders who are known to have hopes of election to the Legislatures, and it is doubtful whether they have the rank and file of Congress behind them. Further, even if the old Swarajist Party is revived and seats are contested at the elections, it by no means follows that the Swarajists elected to the Assembly or Provincial Councils will take their seats. As regards Mr. Gandhi himself, it is reported that he is indifferent whether the Swarajists contest the elections or not, and there is considerable doubt whether he intends his statement to be a genuine callirig-ofi of civil disobedience and is not mere window dressing with the object of inducing the Government to remove the measures they have taken against the Congress. The suspension of civil disobedience will be merely a recognition of facts and for tactical reasons. Congress will continue hostile to Government, and to enter into friendly relations with them would inevitably discourage those who have supported Government and lead to an access of strength to Congress.India Offtce,21st April 1934.S.
