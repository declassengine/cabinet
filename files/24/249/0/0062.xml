THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CCS. 343.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE STRATEGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A DECLARATION CONCERNING BELGIAN SECURITY.REPORT.1. THE Cabinet have accepted in principle &quot; that the defence of Belgian territory against foreign aggression is a vital British interest which we must in case of need actively sustain.&quot; They have consequently directed us to explore generally the strategical implications of the declaration that it is proposed to make concerning Belgium.2. The present appreciation can only be regarded as of a very preliminary character. We cannot present the Cabinet with a full appreciation of the strategical implications of the proposed Declaration without a much more elaborate study than is possible in the time at our disposal.3. We have always held the view which was stated in paragraph 26 of the Report* of the Defence Requirements Committee, that a military force, organised as proposed in that Report &apos;&apos; and supported by appropriate air forces, would, as a deterrent to an aggressor, exercise an influence for peace out of all proportion to its size.&quot; In previous Paperst prepared for the Ministerial Committee also we have explained in considerable detail the importance of Belgian integrity to the safety of this country. If a Declaration is made, however, we shall sooner or later be faced with the problem of working out the detailed plans and preparations for carrying it out in case of necessity, and until that has been done we cannot state the strategical implications in full. In fact, until there have been conversations with the Belgian and later possibly with the French General Staffs any appreciation must be tentative and based on arbitrary assumptions that would require subsequent checking. In the meantime the question of whether a Declaration should be made before the full implications are available is one for Cabinet decision, on which we offer no observations.4. The strategical implications of the proposed declaration concerning Belgian security are so intimately bound up with the future political groupings of the world in general, and of Europe in particular, that it is not possible to separate the two classes of factors which go to make up the problem.5. Without investigating the political possibilities of the future in any manner outside our province, we feel it most improbable that France could remain neutral unless she had been previously defeated by Germany in a war from which, as in 1870, we stood aside. In any event the idea that the United Kingdom and Belgium can alone sustain the onslaught of Germany&apos;s full strength on Belgium is a false one. We would emphasise that not only is it a commitment that this country ought never to accept, but also it would involve a task that would certainly be beyond our powers. From a military point of view, therefore, we would submit that the avoidance of this contingency should be one of the aims of our foreign policy.* Paper No. D.R.C. 14 (also CP. 64 (34)).       f Papers Nos.

6. There is, in our opinion, a tendency to exaggerate the immediate danger from Germany and to treat as imminent a threat which contains many elements of uncertainty. At the same time there appears to us to be an insufficient regard for the difficulties which face Germany, surrounded as she is by potential enemies, the fact that she definitely fears a preventive war on the part of the Allies in the last war, and the long period of preparation necessary before she can be in a. position to engage in a major war of aggression with good prospects of success.7. In examining the strategical implications of a declaration to Belgium, it cannot be too often stated that it is consideration of our own security only which is forcing us to contemplate providing assistance for the defence of that country. Our strategical objects in assisting the Belgian defence so as to avoid the temporary or permanent occupation of Belgium by Germany would be as follows : (a) To gain depth for our own defence measures for the air defence of this country;(&amp;) To prevent the Germans establishing air bases in Belgium, more particu-larly in the western portion of that country, in close proximity to our vulnerable ai^eas;(c) To obtain bases in Belgium from which an air counter-offensive can becarried out at effective range against vulnerable objectives in Germany;(d) To prevent Germany obtaining the use of Belgian ports for navalpurposes, particularly as bases for light forces and submarines.It is obvious that to attain any or all of these objects our military forces must be ready to co-operate at the earliest possible moment in preventing German occupa-tion of Belgian territory.8. We must.possess land as well as air forces with which to intervene rapidly, as, otherwise, it is highly improbable that the Belgians, even with French assistance, could resist for long a resuscitated Germany. Unless Belgian territory can be secured against German invasion, although we should still be able to operate our bombers from French territory, we shall be unable to maintain an advanced air defence organisation which would be of such value in reducing the scale of attack on Great Britain and the Channel ports would be at Germany&apos;s mercy with disastrous consequences. Whether we make a Declaration or not, therefore, the commitment may be said to exist.9. When the time comes to concert in detail the necessary plans for defending Belgium against German occupation, and the forces to be provided to carry out these plans, it will be most important to keep the object for which we are providing these forces clearly in view, e.g., we must not be required to provide for the air defence of Belgium except in so far as this is necessary to achieve our end. Separate air defences will have to be provided in Belgium, and how much Belgium will provide herself and to what extent we shall be required to supple-nient the Belgian preparations, can only be decided when the detailed plans are worked out. Similarly, the air defence measures of the British Expeditionary Force operating in Belgium would also contribute to the air defence of that country, but that is not the primary reason for the provision of those defences. If and when conversations are initiated, these points must be kept in mind.10. As we have already pointed out, it is essential that France should not remain neutral. It appears to us, however, to be probable that a declaration of our intervention on behalf of Belgium would convince France that early assistance by her in the defence of Belgian territory would be to her own greater advantage, as compared with standing on the defensive on her northern frontier. Apart from French direct assistance on land for the defence of Belgium, the advent of her armed forces into the war must have a most far-reaching influence on the situation on land and in the air. The French army must automatically reduce the weight of possible German attack against Belgium to a very large degree, while the assistance of French air forces would increase greatly the weight of air attack which could be delivered on Germany, and might reduce the cumulative effect of German air attacks on this country.
A411. With regard to the purely military implications of the declaration to Belgium, it is obvious that the declaration is of little permanent value unless forces are provided capable of implementing it. Our Expeditionary Force never has been,: and never can be, maintained in peace at a strength adequate in itself for decisive intervention in Europe. It must consist only of the forces available after meeting the normal commitments of Imperial Defence. Its function has been in the past and must be in the future to intervene immediately, in order to give our allies that moral and material support which we may hope will give rapid success, or at least will save them from defeat while the Empire prepares further forces to achieve victory.12. Assuming the active participation of the French army, we consider that it is essential that our military and air forces should arrive in the shortest space of time. The moral and material effect of the arrival of our forces upon the Belgian defence would be very great. It is impossible, however, at this stage to say definitely how and where our forces would be used. Our plans must be sufficiently elastic to enable our intervention to be made in accordance with the circumstances of the time.13. The problem of transportation to and disembarkation on the Continent of our forces is formidable, but by no means insuperable. The forces involved are small. The effect of serious air attack should not prevent embarkation in this country or disembarkation on the other side of the channel, although it might entail diversion in a westerly direction, involving delays in the arrival of the Expeditionary Force, and. conceivably, difficulties in maintenance.Arrangements of this kind, as also the air defence measures required, are all part of the detailed appreciation which it will be necessary to work out later oh, and also have a close bearing on the protective measures for this country.14. It is proposed to provide later contingents from the Territorial Army, either for the reinforcement of the first contingent or to deal with repercussions of the war in other parts of the world, as circumstances may dictate. Such expansion must in any case form an essential part in our plans for any type of war, whether on the Continent or elsewhere.15. Further, the moral and material support which the Dominions can supply, if they are willing to co-operate, and the struggle be prolonged, would be vitally important.16. We are of opinion that prior to a Declaration, we can only formulate the military conditions which we require from Belgium on broad general lines, and we recommend that if a declaration is to be made, the following considera-tions should receive due attention before we are publicly committed : (a) We cannot contemplate going to the assistance of Belgium unless we canbe assured that France will not remain neutral. (6) Provision of efficient and well-balanced fighting forces adequate to implement the declaration.(c) Military conversations with Belgium and later, possibly, with France will undoubtedly be necessary. Without such conversations a declaration could not be implemented in time to avoid disaster.(d) We must be kept fully informed of the Belgian war plans and defenceschemes, and of any important modification which may be made therein.(e) Belgium must afford us intimate facilities for  reconnaissance, thejDreparation of alternative plans and for ultimate action. (/) Belgium must guarantee to defend her territories against air and land attack, and to maintain her defences and defence arrangements in the most efficient condition which her.circumstances permit.(g) Belgium must not act in such a way as would tend to provoke war or to involve her in any war except in undoubted self-defence.(h) For the execution of our plans, it will, in all probability, be necessary forus to use French ports and we must be assured that we will be able to do so. We regard it as inconceivable that, in the circumstances envisaged, France should raise any difficulties in this matter.
17. In this report we have not mentioned the defence of Holland since our terms of reference are limited to the strategical implications involved in a declaration to Belgium. We feel bound to recall, however, that in an earlier Report* to the Ministerial Committee we have emphasised that the integrity of Holland is almost as important to our security as that of Belgium, though we pointed out certain factors which might lead the Germans to leave Holland neutral as in the late war.18. We would emphasize the fact that considerations of our own security may force us to intervene in the defence of Belgium. At the moment, we are not in a position to say definitely what air and anti-aircraft forces would be necessary for this purpose. It is, however, essential that we should avoid placing ourselves in the position of having to undertake this commitment without the assistance of France.19. We have never in the past engaged in a Continental war single-handed, nor do the modern developments in armies and their weapons render it any more possible for us to do so in the future. To attempt to oppose the army of a great continental Power, with the assistance of Belgium alone, would be to shoulder a burden that, in view of our world-wide commitments, would be altogether beyond our capacity.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.
