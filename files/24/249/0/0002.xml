This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1934SECRET.Copy No.   ^CP. 113 (34)THE CABINETIMPERIAL DEFENCE policy memorandum BY THE SECRETARIES  OF STATE  FOR   WAR  AND AIR, AND THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTYVarious   circumstances   have   arisen   since   the  Cabinet   last   discussed   the      79 recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee (Cabinet 11 (34)) which   General prompt us to ask our colleagues to resume their consideration of that Report as a     3211 matter of urgency.   We had only just read the searching analysis by Sir Robert Vansittart of German policy (OP. 104 (34)) when we received the news of the very substantial augmentation of the German Estimates for their three Services and the unsatisfactory explanations given by the German Government.We have now heard that the French reply to our enquiries as to their disarmament policy is such as to leave us with little hope of a satisfactory outcome of the long drawn out deliberations of the Disarmament Conference.The Conference will be l-esumed on 23rd May and it is imperative in our view that we should have made up our minds where we stand before that date.We hope that it is clear to our colleagues that the proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee do not involve any new policy of expansion of our armed forces ; they aim merely at bringing into a state of efficiency forces which are far below a proper standard of adequacy for the defence of the Empire. The operation of the rule of &quot; no major war for ten years &quot; led to the progressive deterioration of their fitness to discharge their functions, as money was not forthcoming in Service Estimates to do much more than maintain the forces from day to day, to make very limited progress with the replacement of our over-age ships, and to undertake a modest programme of mechanization in the Army. Coast Defence and the requirements of a prompt mobilization were left out of account and there are, therefore, formidable arrears to be overtaken.In so far as concerns the Royal Air Force we have, since the Armistice, sunk from first to fifth place numerically amongst the world&apos;s Air Powers. Our present air strength is admittedly wholly inadequate for the requirements of Imperial security and we are still short of what was as long ago as 1923 regarded as the minimum number of squadrons required for Home Defence and this despite the rapid process of air expansion which has been taking place continuously since that date abroad. War reserves are non-existent.We are convinced that the British public is unaware how much weaker we are than in 1914, although we have all said that we have disarmed to the edge of risk.The Government, we submit, would be able to make its influence in continental and world affairs more effectively felt if it were known that we had behind us defences and defence forces in a reasonable condition of adequacy not for any aggressive purpose, but as the safeguard of our own interests and possessions.The matter is one of such A7ital concern, we submit, that it is for consideration whether the Leaders of the Opposition Parties should not be called into our counsels so that a truly national policy can be evolved for what is a truly national concern. Whether such collaboration were forthcoming or not, it would seem to be the duty of the Cabinet to try to educate the people to a proper understanding of affairs. This would be done in no warlike spirit and with every disavowal of any aggressive tendency whatsoever on our part.
The country ought to know what are some of the risks of the future. We should not relax our energetic endeavours to press for any measure of disarmament that can be secured ; we need threaten no one; but we should tell the people, and let other countries know, that there are limits to our tolerance and that we must be prepared to defend ourselves and our interests if unhappily they should be threatened.For these reasons we would press that decisions be taken on the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee which will enable our respective departments to make progress forthwith with the programmes approved by the Government.H. L.-B. E. M.20th April, IP34.(b34/8)   100   4/34   w.o.p.   7799
