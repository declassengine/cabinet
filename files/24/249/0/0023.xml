P.  135  (34)cabinet copy No ... .LICENSING ACT 1921 - EXTENSION OP PERMITTEDHOURS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.     At the Cabinet Meeting on May 2nd I&apos;called the attention of my colleagues to a High Court decision (Rex v. Sussex Licensing Justices,  ex parte Bubb)  in the matter of licensing hours which was likely to give rise to serious difficulties and might need to be remedied by legislation.      That decision has now been upheld by the Court of Appeal,  and it is necessary to decide immediately as to the action which should be taken.2.     Briefly, the position is as follows.      Proviso (b)  to section l(l) of the Licensing Act,  1921, gives licensing justices in the provinces power by order (made at Brewster Sessions)  to extend the night closing hour on week days from 10 p.m.  to 10.30 p.m., where satisfied that the special requirements of the district render it desirable.     In some 120 or more districts,  including most of the principal holiday resorts,  licensing benches have made such orders applying to part of the year only,  that is for some or all of the summer months.      It is one of these orders, made by the licensing justices for the Steyning Division of Sussex (extending the late hour to 10.30 p.m.  during summer time) which, has now been declared to be invalid, the Court having ruled that any such order can only be made for the whole of the year.3.     I am advised that the High Court decision does not automatically render invalid and inoperative similar orders made in other districts, which would need to be challenged separately if they are to be upset;    but it is bound to be, and has already been,  the cause of much immediate confusion
and uncertainty.     Moreover, when the time conies at Brewster Sessions next February for fixing the hours for 1935, all the licensing benches concerned will be bound,  in view of the High Court decision,  to fix the later closing hour either for the whole year  (which may not be needed)  or not at all.4.     The practice, now declared illegal,  of granting the late night extension for the summer months only has a useful and appropriate application to places such as holiday resorts whichmay not require the later hour during the winter months;    andits abolition will give rise to widespread dissatisfaction.There is already a strong demand for the Government to remedy the position by legislation,  and I should propose, subject tothe approval of the Cabinet,  to introduce such a measureimmediately.5.     The operation of the proposed Bill would be limited to the restoration of a power which a large number of licensing benches have hitherto thought they possessed,  and have exercised for a number of years,  and which clearly meets a genuine public need.      Proposals on these lines would be widely welcomed by the general public and would not,  I think,  in the circumstances be open to serious attack from any quarter.6.      It might,  of course, be suggested that the introduction of such a Bill (a) would imply a rejection by the Government   -of the recommendations of the Royal Commission (who proposed a uniform 10 p.m.  closing hour,  involving the abolition of the power of the licensing justices to fix a later hour) and (b) would be inconsistent with the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to Mr. Lockv/ood&apos;s Standardisation of Hours Bill.     Any such criticism could, however, be met by limiting the operation of the measure to a fixed period (which could be extended if necessary under the expiring laws continuance procedure).      The&apos; Bill would thus be in the nature of a temporary provision,  to meet a particular emergency, which
11th May,  1934.would give time to the Government for consideration of the whole position and would not commit them to any final verdict on the general issue.7.     One further point needs to be mentioned.      Under thesame provision of the Act of 1921 (proviso  (b)  to section l(l)) the licensing justices have power also to fix amorning opening hour earlier than the normal early limit of11 a.m.      Orders have been made by licensing justicesapplying this variation also for part of the year only,  and as such orders would apparently be open to attack on thesame grounds as in the case of the Steyning order, I should propose to include these orders also within the scope ofthe Bill.8.     The exact terms of the Bill have not yet been settled in consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman, but the effect will be to amend the Licensing Act,  1921,  so as(i)    to provide for the validation of the Steyning order and of all similar orders at present in force which extend or vary the permitted hours for part of the year only:    and (ii)    to enable licensing justices to make such orders in the future. There will also be a provision, as indicated above, limiting the duration of the Act to the end of 1935.9.      In view of the urgency of the matter,  I should be glad to have authority to introduce the Bill at as early a date as ca,n be arranged with the Chief Whip, and to announce the Government&apos;s decision before the Recess.J.G.
