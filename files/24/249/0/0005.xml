S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNJC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).ICRET.t.  116 (54).COPY NO. i^&amp;cabinet.GERMAN RB-ARMAMENT.22Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to ray colleagues for information a short Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to supplement the information in his Memorandum circulated as CP.  104 (34).Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office.I have it from a source, for which I can completely vouch, that the Germans are already constructing bombing-planes on a considerable scale.    Some of the parts are being made at Limhamn, a small place just outside Malmo in South Sweden, while the vital parts are being made at Dessau in Germany, where the planes are put together.    Over 100 have already been made there, ostensibly for export to Russia. The plant at Dessau is now capable of constructing bombing-planes in series at any moment.    Bombing-planes have already been constructed disguised for use with the Posthansa, but they have already been fitted for the installation of machine guns and bombracks.My information is quite definite and above suspicion.I would again urge that this information points to the necessity of early consideration of the report of the Defence Requirements Committee.(Intld.) J.S.Foreign Office, S.W.1April 23rd,  1934.(Signed) ROBERT VANSITTART.Foreign Office, 23rd April,  1934.
