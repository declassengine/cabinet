Proposals for the establishment of minimum prices. ManiSrandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I wish to bring before my colleagues as a matter of urgency a question of considerable difficulty and importance which has arisen under the London Wheat Agreement of last August.Under that Agreement, it will be remembered,  the chief exporting countries agreed to limit their exports during the two crop years 1933-34 and 1934-35,  on certain assumptions as to the magnitude of the world demand.     The assumptions, from one cause and another, have been falsified by events.      So far as can be seen at present the surplus stocks in Canada and the U.S.A. which the Agreement was designed to liquidate will,  if nothing further is done, be actually larger at the end of the period, than they were at the beginning.A drastic reduction of acreage seems to be the only solution (short of an actual destruction of the stocks) :   but even the U.S.A,Government would have to take further powers for the purpose;    Canada is only just overcoming the political difficulties inherent in such a policy;   Australia has not yet seen her way to direct action, and Argentina is shewing signs of a disposition to break away from the Agreement altogether.The Price of wheat, which it was the object of the London Agreement to raise, has on the whole been sagging ever since the Agreement was signed.In these circumstances the International Wheat Advisory Committee, which was set up to watch the operation of the Agreement, have given a good deal of consideration to the question of an arrangement for stabilising, ana if possible
raising, prices, pending a more effective control of production. At their Rome meeting last month, they worked out a scheme which they have submitted to the signatory Governments, asking them to say definitely whether they are prepared to accept it or not at the adjourned meeting v/hich begins in London next Monday,The scheme appears to be supported by the majority at any rate of the sixteen countries represented on the Committee, though the support of Argentina is at the moment in doubtj    but it presents pe culiar difficulties for the United Kingdom.    It provides for the drawing up of a schedule of minimum prices at first for certain key grades of wheat, and later for other grades as need arises.   The prices to be fixed in the first instance are prices ci.f. the United kingdom (or other world market) and f.o.b. prices would be worked out on this basis. The prices so fixed and any alterations can only come into operation if no party to the London Agreement, importing or exporting country, objects *    All exporting countries would agree to maintain their internal prices at not less than the export level, if necessary by segregating stocks.-     Export subsidies would not be greater than the excess of the internal over the external price,There is nothing to prevent the exporting countries from putting such a scheme into force tomorrow if the;y thought fit, but the essence of the London Agreement is that importing countries are equally parties to it, and the exporters would think twice before proceeding without their consent.   Accordingly we in the United Kingdom as the largest importers have to make up our minds whether or not we are prepared to submit with a good grace to a scheme for the stabilisation (to put it no higher)  of wheat prices which is regarded by most of the countries concerned, Including two of the Dominions as the only means immediately available of saving the situation.I may say here that I have serious doubts of the practical workability of the scheme, and this Is a matter which vyill need
to be very fully explored by the Committee,,     In particular I feel that it is far from certain that che oroducing c -countries would be able and willing to take the necessary steps to control internal prices,,      I think further that the intentions of the exporting countries with regard to reduction of acreage must be much more clearly and definitely stated.     The case of Argentina is particularly dubious, and indeed it is possible that she may refuse to accept the scheme altogether,,In view of the importance of the proposal to our grain trade I asked two representatives of the trade to assist the official representative at the Rome meeting.      The trade ore accordingly fully c mversant with the subject, and yesterday I received a deputation from them, and from the millers and bakers, to protest against the Committee&apos;s proposal.The fears which they expressed were oossibly exaggeratedin some respects, but their objections are undoubtedly serious.It was represented -(l) that London might cease to be the centre of theinternational grain trade, with considerable loss of financial and other business,(2) that the Liverpool Futures Market would be put out of action, and traders lose valuable &quot;hedging&quot; facilities.(3) that the inducement to hold stocks would tend to disappear,(4) that the scheme owing to the complexity of theprice system, and the manifold possibilities of evasion, would break down.Y/hen I asked them whether they had any alternative suggestion for dealing with the situation they urged &quot;that production should forthwith be cut down in exporting countries to a point where the surplus stocks will tend to disappear&quot;.I will not atteraot to discuss these objections in detail. Undoubtedly a contr)l of prices would substantially alter the conditions under v.rhich the grain trade it at present carried on:   how far the trade could, accommodate itself to the altered conditions must be to some extent a matter of conjecture.The objections to the proposal are largely economic.     The
arguments in its favour on the other hand are largelypolitical.   It is strongly advocated by two of theDominions, one of which, Canada, with her huge surplussWoit, Is more concerned than any other single country.We are parties to the Wheat Agreement and played some part inthe negotiations which led up to it.    It is represented thata control of prices is necessary to counteract the psychological effect on the market of the huge stocks which overhang it and would give the exporting countries a breathing space inwhich to organise a drastic control of production. If the statistical position w^re fully understood it would bedifficult to prevent a serious collapse oi prices, which arealready dangerously low.    It may be that some arrangement between the exporting countries with regard to prices is theonly thing at the moment which will save the Agreement.The refusal of the United Kingdom to countenance such anarrangement would undoubtedly be regarded as a very serious matter.    The odium we should incur might be the greater inthe eyes of a country like the U.S.A. because while she iscutting down her acreage we under the Wheat Act have beenincrt?asing ours,    (a similar difficulty would however arise on a smaller scale if the scheme were in force and the UnitedKingdom alone objected to a proposed alt&amp;ration of price, )We are faced with a dilemma; and I cannot say that I regard either alternative with any satisiaction.    On the onehand, though I suspect that the picture presented by thetrade is a little overdrawn, there are undoubted elements of danger in the scheme.    On the oth-rr,    though I should like to feel more sure than I do that the exporting countries as a whole are really facing up to the problem oi regulatingproduction, I am bound to recognise their serious politicaldifii cultios.I hope my colleagues will give this question their
03      Iimmediate consideration, and I should be glad to hear as soon as possible of any views that they may form.      It is clearly important that the attitude of the United Kingdom should be stated at an early stage of the Advisory Committee1s meeting, not later in any case,  I think, than Tuesday morning, and if possible on Monday.The question at issue is whether we should:(a) inform the other countries parties to the Wheat agreement that we are prepared to accept a scheme for minimum export prices if all the ether countries regard it as the only remedy for the existing situation,or(b) state that having regard to our special interests asimporters and traders we cannot become parties to a scheme which is in our view unworkable and open to serious economic objection.W.R.ard of Trade, 3rd May, 1934.
