___S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPIKiBNT).S C R E ToP,  144  (34). COPY NO.        3&quot;*A B I N E Tt-WEARING- CP &quot;POLITICAL UNIFORMS&quot;. Memorandum by the Homo Secretary.1. I desire to obtain the views of the Cabinet onthe question whether any steps should be taken by legis-lation to restrict the wearing of what have come to be called &quot;political uniforms&quot;&quot;2. There are at present a number of political or-semi-political organisations which wear a distinguishing uniform - usually, following the example of continental organisations, a coloured shirt.      Most of these however are either unimportant  (such as the Kibbo-Kift, who wear green shirts)  or are not specially associated in the public mind with the wearing of uniform (e.g. , the I.L.P. Guild of Youth whose members sometimes wear red shirts) .      The only existing organisation whose active existence and further development are closely connected with the wearing of uniform is the British Union of Fascists, whose head is Sir Oswald Mosley.      It is only in relation to this organisation that any immediate practical problem exists and, though any legislation would have to be of general application, it would he taken to be, and would in fact he, primarily directed against the British Union of Fascists.3. I do not propose here to go into the largerpolitical aspects of the problem., but it is obvious that an organisation like the British Union of Fascists, though it may for the time profess an intention to
inachieve its objects by constitutional means, might, if it developed sufficiently in numbers and influence, feel itself strong enough at some future date to adept other methods.4. I have however looked at the problem more from the purely police point of view and recent developments make it clear that the Fascists are responsible for a sub-stantial amount of disorder.      Not only has there been a large increase in the number of cases in London where their activities have led to breaches of the peace, but large meetings have been held in various parts of the country and these have generally been accompanied by more or less  serious disorder.      For example, recent meetings at Bristol and Newcastle-on-Tyne led to a number of arrests and injuries and my colleagues will no doubt remember the proceedings which were necessary as a result of the Fascist intervention in the tithe dispute in East Suffolk.5. There can be no doubt that the wearing of uniformis an important factor in this problem.      It intensifies the aggressive behaviour of the Fascists and gives to what would otherwise be harmless evolutions a semi-military appearance which causes considerable resentment. It also gives to their assemblies a coherence and discipline which, in the event of a clash, greatly increases the difficulties of the Police.6. I am confident that, if some restriction were placed on the wearing of uniforms in public by considerable bodies of persons, it would be of great assistance to the Police.      It is not however easy to devise a means of regulation which would not interfere with legitimate activities and I am not in a position to propose any solution of the problem which is entirely free from
objections.      I have studied the legislation of other countries which have attempted to deal with this question, hut it affords no useful guidance because, apart from any differences in their political and legal institutions, it places more power in the hands of the central executive than, in the absence of a grave emergency, would be likely to be acceptable here.7. I have been asked a number of Questions in theRouse of Commons in the last few months as to the inten-tions of the Government.      I have not thought fit to submit any proposals to the Cabinet because, although the subject has been well ventilated in the Press (which on the whole has been in favour of some action)  it has appeared to me to be doubtful whether the House of Commons would in present circumstances support the imposition of any restrictions.      I am confirmed in this view by the attitude of the House on the 16th May when, without a division, it refused leave to Commander Locker-Lampson to introduce a Bill for this purpose, though no doubt it was partljr influenced by the consideration that any legislation on this subject ought to be introduced by the Government.8. It is obvious that in the circumstances any legislation would he controversial and there would there-fore by no opportunity of passing it in the present Session.      I do not however suggest that a definite decision not to legislate should now he taken hut that the question should stand over for the present and that in the meantime I should continue to keep a careful watch on developments with a view to bringing the matter before the Cabinet again if necessary.
..  Ill9. If my colleagues approve of this policy, I would propose to arrange a Question in the House of Commons, in reply to which I would make it clear that, while the Government do not propose to take any action at present, they do not intend to allow any political organisation, whether of the Right or the Left, to act in such a way as to he a menace to public order and that, if future developments should make it necessary, they will submit to Parliament such proposals as they think appropriate.(Intd.)    J.G0HOME OPFICS ,    S -    1 - , 25rd May, 1934.
