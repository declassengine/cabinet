P.165(34)CABINET. Trade Agreement with France. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.   The Heads of a short terra trade Agreement with France were Initialled ad referendum on the 16th June, and I now seek Cabinet authority for the signature of the Agreement.     Subject to its approval by the two Governments and to the neoessary formalities being completed in time,it is Intended to bring the Agreement into force on 1st July provisionally and pending rat^LfIcai-icn*.Negotiations for a general establishment treaty (which is being dealt with separately from the present Agreement) are being continued, and I need not trouble the Cabinet on this subject.2.    In the first place I should refer to the peouliar circumstances in which the negotiation has taken plaoe.   At the beginning of 1S34 the French Government, in pursuance of a misguided policy of quota bargaining, had withheld from us our fair share of the trade in oertain goods, notably cotton manufactures, demanding concessions before giving back to us that which we had forme&amp;ly enjoyed.   We had refused to treat on this basis    and had retaliated by imposing 3peoial discriminatory duties on French silks and wearing apparel.     Thus we have been involved for some months in a limited tariff war with France,3.   A second difficulty has been the imminence of a long delayed Increase in the protection of our own silk industry, a matter of particular concern  to France.   My colleagues will remember that it was owing to our inability to give^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVEHHMBHT. IRBT. POFY.NO.
the French any security for their important trade in silks that the discussions in March came to nothing.     Yet a third, difficulty was the very serious effect on French trade and on public opinion in France of our preventive measures against the Colorado &quot;beetle, and especially the complete embargo on. imports of French potatoes.4. In these exceptionally difficult circumstances, I think it is very much to the credit of both parties that it has been possible to come to terms on a basis which in no way cuts across our own industrial and agricultural policies, even in the very difficult matter of increased protection for our silk industry.     My thanks are particularly due to the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has been willing to agree that the increased protection of the silk and artificial silk industry should be effected mainly by a reduction in the Revenue duties on the raw materials rather than by an increase in the import duties on the manufactured products.     Jven with this palliative the main crisis in the negotiations came on the new silk duties and we were pressed hard to review the proposed duties on some of the lighter fabrics, where it was claimed that the new scale means a heavy increase in the burden on imported goods.     However, we stood absolutely firm on this point, refusing to modify in any way the scheme -prepared by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and eventually the French gave way.5. I do not propose to outline the course of the negotiations which were extremely arduous, and will content myself with summarising the salient points of the proposed Trade Agreement.
6,   On.the credit aide we have secured:^(a) the restoration of our full share of all quotas, including a guarantee of our full share of any new quotas which may he introduced, in future;(b) As regards coal, we have also secured that the valuable trade we enjoy outside the quota proper for coal shall not be interfered with.(c) As regards manufactured goods and fish, the Frenoh quotas affect imports from the United Kingdom worth about  3,750,000 per annum.     For nearly all the more important of these goods (i.e., to the value of about  3,000,000) we have secured, in addition to our full share of such imports as may be admitted, guarantees that the quantities of the British imports ehall not be restricted below a certain figure.     This figure represents in most cases our full share of the present quotas; but in aome classes of cotton goods (and one or two other categories of less importance) the quantities actually guaranteed are somewhat less than we should get if our former quotas were fully restored.     In th^se latter cases our trade will of course only be reduced if the trade of other countries is equally reduced.(d) We have also secured useful ameliorations in the working of the quota system (including in a few cases the transfer of the administration of quotas to trade organisations in this country) , which should go far to meet the frequent complaints made in the past and lead to increased trade within the quota limits.     In fact a number of complaints of this kind have already been cleared up during the negotiations.7*     On the other side the main concession is on the silk duties.     What is proposed is that, instead of the duties being increased they should be left at about their present level (though the basis of assessment is being completely revised), but that the import duty on raw silk and the excise duty on artificial silk should be reduced by 50^, at a cost to the revenue of about  2,000,000.     The rates proposed are, as I have indicated, those that the Import Duties Advisory Committee are prepared to recommend on the assumption that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be r^ady to forego revenue to the extent.     A reduction of the
revenue duty ia in fact regarded by the Committee as very desirable from the point of view of the home industry and consumer;   in addition to giving the same degree of protection as an increase in the import duties it should lead to increased consumption as a result of lower prices*     The reduction is also likely,in my opinion9 to prevent serious.difficulties with other countries - Italy, Switzerland and Japan.     From the French point of view the proposed change, though much better than the alternative of an increase in the import duties is regarded as somewhat to their disadvantege compared with the existing position, firstly because there will be   growing competition from the home Industry, and secondly because there will be a substantial increase in duty on a part^ albeit a small part, of their trade.8. The French made a number of requests for tariff reductions on other classes of goods, nearly all of which were refused.     We agreed, however, to reductions of duty (a) on a few kinds of vegetables and flowers (e.g,, asparagus during March and the first half of April, and snowdrops during December ana January) (b) on cigarette papers (a minor French specialty) and (c) a reciprocal arrangement on printed matter advertising travel or exhibitions abroad.     We have also undertaken not to increase the existing duties on sparkling wines, brandy, glace kid leather, certain fancy goods for which the duties are already consolidated under the German Agreement, and crystallised, etc., cherries.     In no case was there any present intention to increase these duties.     We have also agreed to a slight change in the definition of goods liable to duty as embroidery.     The effect is to exclude from this duty piece-goods looking like embroidery which are in fact composed solely of warp and weft running continuously throughout the fabric.     &apos;Iho existing Customs provisions in regard to embroidery have been proved by experience to be unsatisfactory in practice.
9. The Agreement contains a general provision for most-favoured-notion treatment in customs matters, and it also takes note of an undertaking given hy the south Wales coal . exporters to buy a certain amount of French pit-props.     This may he regarded in some measure as a quid pro quo for the guarantees given for the additional British coal falling outsid the normal quota for coal.10. There is also a so-called &quot;equilibrium&quot; clause under which, if either party takes measures which upset the balance established by the Agreement, the other party is entitled to take corresponding counter-measures.     This is necessarily vague, but we have impressed on the French that we should certainly regard any raising of tariffs on goods subject to quota, which had the effect of reducing our trade below the quantitative limits guaranteed to us, as bringing this clause into effect.11. The Agreement can be brought to an end on 1st April, 1935,  and runs on thereafter subject to three clear months1 notice.      In the event however of a &quot;grave variation&quot; in the rate of exchange between the currencies of the two countries it can be terminated at one month&apos;s notice.      In my view this is a useful provision in these uncertain times.12. At the same time the Minister of Agriculture has made an arrangement about the sanitary restrictions on French vegetables and plants.     He maintains the embargo on French potatoes, but has made minor modifications as to both season and area in the restrictions on certain vegetables and as to area in the case of living plants.      In return the French have removed their embargo on our seed potatoes, so long as they come from areas clear of the Colorado Beetle,,
13.    Some critics of ^he^Agx-agreement^will doubtless complain that it does not go far enough in opening the way for increased trade between the two countries.   This is true to the expert that neither country is prepared to modify materially its general economic policy at the behest of the other.    The value of the Agreement is that it restores trade to a   full most-favoured-nation basis and should at least tend to stabilise the existing volume of trade.    It should be remembered that the discriminatory exchange compensation surtax of 15% on our goods was suppressed on 1st January and the rates at which the Import Turnover Tax had been levied on our goods were reduced on 1st April to the lowest rate applicable to other countries.14.   Even more important, I feel that the French have had a sharp lesson, which will also be a useful warning to some other countries.   Apart from the obligations undertaken in the Agreement, I should doubt whether the French would contemplate for some time withholding from us the most-favoured-nation treatment which we claim to be the least that %7e are entitled to expect.Board of Trade,18th June, 1934.
