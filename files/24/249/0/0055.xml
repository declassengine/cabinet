THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 168 (34).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON  THE  TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THEKING&apos;S ACCESSION.REPORT.1. AT their Meeting on the 30th May, 1934 (Cabinet 22 (34), Conclusion 5), the Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum by the Home Secretary (Paper CP. 139 (34)) on the arrangements for the celebrations of the twenty-fifth anniversary of His Majesty the King&apos;s Accession, and agreed (a) That a Committee, composed as follows The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for India (or representative),The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Commissioner of Works,A Representative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,should formulate, for consideration by the Cabinet, a scheme for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession; the Lord Chamberlain and Ministers of other Departments to be invited to attend meetings as required;(b) That no announcement should be made of this Cabinet Committee.2. We have held two meetings, at both of which the Lord Chamberlain has been present. At our first meeting we considered certain tentative suggestions for a sketch programme of the Celebrations in London, which had been prepared by Lord Cromer. We referred these proposals for consideration in detail to an Inter-departmental Committee, composed of representatives of the Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Office and of the Government Departments concerned.3. We attach (Annex I) the Report of this Inter-departmental Committee: a summarised version of the suggested programme for the London Celebrations will be found on pages 11-13 of the Report. Subject to the following observations, we agree generally Avith the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Inter-departmental Report.General Scope of Celebrations.4. (a) As stated in paragraph 3,* The King desires that the Celebrations in 1935 should be as simple as possible, all extravagance and ostentation being-avoided.   Moreover, it has been thought desirable to shorten the programme so* Note. The references are to paragraphs in the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.[10224]   [10579]
that His Majesty may be spared undue strain and fatigue. At our request the Lord Chamberlain has invited Lord Dawson of Penn to advise whether the proposed programme is satisfactory from this point of view. The Home Secretary hopes to be in a position to inform the Cabinet of Lord Dawson&apos;s views at the Meeting on the 4th July.Press Notice.(b) We agree that it is very desirable, as suggested in paragraph 5,* that a Press Notice should be issued, if possible before the forthcoming summer holidays, on the lines proposed. We attach (Annex II) a preliminary draft of this Press Notice, and we suggest that the text of the notice, in the form adopted by the Cabinet, should be agreed with The King&apos;s Private Secretary before publication.Local Celebrations: Scotland.   (Paragraphs* 9, 46 and 56 (c)).(c) We understand that it is improbable that The King will go to Scotland next year for any lengthy period. In any case, the usual triennial State visit to Holyrood is not contemplated. While no arrangements in regard to Scotland can be made until The King&apos;s wishes have been definitely ascertained, it may be found that if His Majesty goes to Balmoral sometime in August, 1935, the most convenient arrangement for the reception of Addresses from the Privileged Bodies in Scotland might be for those Addresses to be presented at Edinburgh, if His Majesty would consent to break his journey to Balmoral at Edinburgh for the purpose of receiving them.It has been suggested to us that the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of His Majesty&apos;s Accession might be marked by the appointment of some Member of the Royal Family to fill the post of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1935. We recommend that The King&apos;s wishes in regard to this suggestion should be ascertained.Wales.(d) Public opinion in Wales would be very gratified if arrangements could be made for the Prince of Wales to take part in some ceremony, either at Cardiff or at Carnarvon Castle. We recommend in connection with the Celebrations in Wales that, if possible, one ceremony (either at Cardiff or Carnarvon), to be presided over by the Prince of Wales, should take place on some convenient date, preferably in May. It may be noted that Tuesday, the 14th May, to Friday, the 17th May, inclusive, are &quot; free &quot; days so far as the London Celebrations are concerned.Overseas Representation.  Representation of N&apos;etvfoundland.ie) It will be observed (paragraph* 11) that the Inter-departmental Committee agree with the Dominions Office that no special representation of Newfoundland at the Celebrations appears to be necessary. We feel considerable doubt as to this conclusion. We attach very great importance, particularly on this occasion, to the avoidance of any action which might be misunderstood or construed as a slight on the people of Newfoundland. We fully appreciate the difficulty in present circumstances of treating Newfoundland in the matter of representation in the same way as the other Dominions, and we recognise the special difficulty of determining, in the circumstances, which of the persons who for the time being compose the Government of Newfoundland should be selected to represent Newfoundland.In the circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a special Address from Newfoundland, which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should present at the reception at St. James&apos;s Palace on Wednesday, the 8th May, 1935. We feel, however, that this suggestion does not provide an adequate and satisfactory solution, and we have invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to re-examine the question of the representation of Newfoundland at the Celebrations with a view to further consideration being given to the matter in Cabinet on the 4th July.* Note. The references are to paragraphs in the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Eeport.
* Note. The references lire to paragraphs in the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report.Colonial Representation.(/) It is in our view important that the other proposals of the Inter-departmental Committee regarding Overseas representation should be maintained and should not be weakened by concessions. We are, for example, informed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that, if it was decided to allow the Australian States or the Canadian Provinces to be separately represented, he would experience very great difficulty in resisting claims for representation from various important Colonies.India.   (Paragraph^ 14.)(g) We have invited the Secretary of State for India to confer forthwith with Lord Willingdon on the question of representation from India, in order that, if possible, the Cabinet may be informed on the 4th July of Lord Willingdon&apos;s views on the matter.Special Issue of Coins.(h) We have communicated to the Treasury a suggestion that, following precedent, a special issue of silver coins should be arranged in connection with the occasion of the 1935 Celebrations.Thanksgiving Service.   (Paragraph* 25.)(i) While the normal seating capacity of St. Pauhs Cathedral will accom-accommodate about 5,000 persons, only about 3,000 of them would be able to watch the ceremony.In this connection we observe that nearly half the available seats would, under the Inter-departmental Committee&apos;s proposals, have to be allocated to Members of both Houses of Parliament and their wives, and we agree that instead of all Members of both Houses being invited to the Service, a number of places should be reserved for each House.We also agree that the congregation at St. Paul&apos;s should not include Lord Lieutenants and High Sheriffs of Counties as such, Lord Mayors (other than the Lord Mayor of London) and Mayors, Lord Provosts and Provosts, and Chairmen of County Councils. On the 6th May these personages should be taking part in the Celebrations in their respective localities. In this way we hope to keep the number of invitations to the Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul&apos;s within manage-able limits. The Lord Chamberlain proposes to arrange for an Inter-depart-mental Committee of the Departments concerned to advise his Department as to the allotment, &amp;c, of the invitations to the Service.Suggested Reception at Guildhall.   (Paragraph* 29.)(j) We agree, that if The King consents to attend a banquet or luncheon at Guildhall, it should be on some date other than the 6th May.Broadcast Message to the Empire.   (Paragraph* 31.)(k) The technical arrangements for the broadcasting will be made by the Lord Chamberlaius Office with the B.B.C.; the text of His Majesty&apos;s Message will be settled in consultation with The King&apos;s Private Secretary.Illuminations, &amp;c.   (Paragraphs* 32-35.)(I) We agree that an official firework display would be open to considerable objection, and that floodlighting is much to be preferred. In connection with paragraph^ 35, we understand that His Majesty&apos;s wishes will also be ascertained in regard to a suggestion that Buckingham Palace should be floodlit on the night (14th May) of the State Ball.Presentation of Addresses by both Houses of Parliament.   (Paragraphs 40.)(m) It is possible that The King may prefer to receive these Addresses, either in the Royal Gallery or at Buckingham Palace, rather than in Westminster Hall. It has been suggested that if the ceremony takes place in Westminster Hall, levee dress should be worn. The King&apos;s wishes in regard to these matters will be ascertained.
Proposal to Entertain the Unemployed.   (Paragraph/^ 50.)(n) We agree with the Inter-departmental Committee, and regret that we cannot recommend the Cabinet to adopt the suggestion that the Unemployed should either be entertained or that some small money gift (say 2s. Qd.) should be made to them individually or in some other way. It is possible that some time later in the year The King might be willing to pay a personal visit to some of the unemployed training centres.Reviews.   (Paragraph 56.)(o) We understand that it would be more convenient if the Naval Review at Spithead could take place, not as suggested by the Inter-departmental Committee between the 15th and the 20th July, but at the time (end of July-beginning of August) when The King will be at Cowes. The Admiralty have been invited to consider this suggestion.The question of a possible Review of Territorials in Scotland will be considered in consultation with the Military Authorities when The King&apos;s wishes have been ascertained.His Majesty&apos;s wishes will also be ascertained in regard to a suggestion that when He is in Scotland next year a Review of Scottish Boy Scouts and other similar organisations might be contemplated.5.   We submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet : (i) That, provided that Lord Dawson is satisfied from his point of view inregard to the suggested sketch programme for the Celebrations in London, the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee (Annex I) should be provisionally approved, subject to the modifications and observations contained in this Report.(ii) That, the text of the proposed Press Notice (Annex II) should also be provisionally approved.(iii) That His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure should be ascertained in regard to the suggested sketch programme for the London Celebrations, the Reviews and the other proposals as provisionally approved by the Cabinet.(iv) That if the proposals commend themselves to The King, the Press Noticeshould be published after its text has been agreed with His Majesty&apos;s Private Secretary.Signed on behalf of the Committee,JOHN GILMOTJR, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 30, 1934.* Note.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1934.SECRET. Copy No. --                               ANNEX I.K.A. (34) 2.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this  document.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THEKING&apos;S ACCESSION.Report of  Inter-Departmental Committee.AT the Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the 7th June, 1934 (K.A. (34) 1st Meeting), it was agreed inter alia that an Inter-Departmental Committee composed of representatives of the Departments concerned should be invited to examine the various points of detail raised at. the Meeting and any other points of detail that might be suggested, and should, report to the Cabinet Committee at their next Meeting on the 28th June, 1934.2. The Inter-Departmental Committee was accordingly constituted under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department; the other members were Colonel the Hon. Sir George Crichton, G.C.V.O., Controller, Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Department, representatives of the Treasury, Home Office, War Office, Foreign Office, India Office, Dominions Office, Colonial Office, Air Ministry, Scottish Office, Ministry of Health, Admiralty, Board of Education and Office of Works, the Commissioner of Police for the City of London and an Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Colonel Sir Arthur Erskine, K.C.V.O., D.S.O., Crown Equerry, attended a Meeting of a Sub-Committee on Reviews and Routes of Processional Drives. The Committee have carefully considered the various proposals contained in the Conclusions of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s first Meeting, and now submit the following report.Report.3. We observe that the Lord Chamberlain informed the Cabinet Committee that The King desired that the Celebrations in 1935 should be simplified as much as possible, and that all extravagance and ostentation should be avoided. We also understand that it is thought desirable to shorten and simplify the programme in order that His Majesty may be spared undue strain and fatigue. We have been careful to bear these considerations in mind throughout our review of the pro-posals before us.4. We understand that no detailed proposals have as yet been laid before The King, but we think that it may be convenient to the Cabinet Committee to have before them tentative suggestions for a sketch programme, which, if adopted by Ministers, might then be submitted for His Majesty&apos;s approval. We have assumed that until His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure is signified the arrangements in con-templation must be treated as highly confidential. It has not, therefore, been possible for us to examine in close detail certain aspects of the proposals, as this could only be done after consultation and discussion with Local Authorities and other outside bodies and persons.    When the need for secrecy has passed, the[10197] &apos;   b
Departments concerned will be in a position to formulate their recommendations in a more definite and comprehensive form than is possible at present.5. In this connection we venture to suggest that it is very desirable that a Press notice should be issued, if possible, before the summer holidays, indicating that it is The King&apos;s wish that the Celebrations should be of a simple and unostentatious character; that a programme (an outline of v/hich might be given) has been prepared on this basis and with due regard to His Majesty being spared undue strain and fatigue, and that this programme has now received The King&apos;s approval. If this suggestion is accepted we assume that the terms of the Press notice will be agreed in advance with The King&apos;s Private Secretary.6. Further publication of details of the programme appears to be undesirable, at all events for some time to come. Indeed, some of the proposals outlined in this report should, in the view of the Departments, be treated as confidential up to the eve of the Celebrations.7. Before summarising our suggestions for an actual sketch programme of the Celebrations, there are certain matters to which we wish to draw attention.Name for the Celebrations.8. It seems desirable, following the precedent of 1897 when the approval of Queen Victoria was given to the expression &quot;Diamond Jubilee,&quot; that some similar title should be recognised in regard to the 1935 Anniversary. We suggest that the title &quot; Silver Jubilee &quot; should be submitted for The King&apos;s approval. We may add that it may be anticipated that as in 1897 many applications will be received for permission to give the 1935 title to Hospitals, Convalescent Homes and other Institutions and Memorials.Local Celebrations.9. We understand that it is intended that the official Celebrations should be concentrated in London, though it is possible that His Majesty may wish to pay a ceremonial visit to Scotland next year, during which Addresses from the Privileged Bodies in Scotland could be received. The Celebrations outside London will be for each locality to arrange for itself.Overseas Representation. Foreign.10. We note that in the view of the Cabinet Committee no Rulers of foreign States should be invited to take part in the Celebrations. It may be anticipated, however, that foreign countries may wish to send Special Missions to London on this occasion. The presence of such Missions would, of course, mean a substantial addition to the burden on His Majesty, greater elaboration, and heavy expense. In these circumstances we recommend that the sending of Special Missions should be strongly discouraged, and that the representation of foreign countries at Ceremonies should be confined to the Diplomatic Representatives in London of those countries.Dominions.11. The Prime Ministers of the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, have welcomed the suggestion that they should be present in London during the Celebratioris, and we assume that they would be the guests of the United Kingdom Government. The President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State has indicated his inability in existing conditions to accept the invitation. We are advised by the Dominions Office that the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia should be invited to the Celebrations on the same terms as the Dominion Prime Ministers, and also that no special representation of Newfoundland and the South African Territories appeai*s necessary. We concur in these suggestions.12. It is possible that some, or all, of the Australian States may ask that they may be represented by their respective Premiers. We agree with the view of the Dominions Office that the States can be regarded as adequately represented by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.   If any of the State
Premiers happen to be in London at the time, they will, of course, be invited to participate in the Ceremonies, but would not be included in the category of official guests. The same procedure should be followed in the case of the Premiers of the Canadian Provinces, subject to any views which might be expressed by the Canadian Government.Colonies.13. In view of the fact that the proposed Celebrations in London are not to be of an elaborate and expensive character, we agree with the Colonial Office that the various Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories should be discouraged from sending representatives to London, and should be invited to concentrate on purely local Celebrations. In this event the Secretary of State for the Colonies would represent the Colonial Empire as a whole, and any Colonial Governors who happened to be in London at the time might be invited to participate in the Ceremonies, but would not be the official guests of the Government.India.14. We are informed that the Secretary of State for India proposes to confer with Lord Willingdon during the latter&apos;s stay in England in regard to Indian participation in the Celebrations, and the following suggestions are there-fore subject to alteration. It is not proposed to invite any Indian Princes to attend the Celebrations as the official guests of the United Kingdom Government. There would, in any case, be no presentation in London of Addresses by the Indian Princes.15. It is contemplated that representation from British India might be limited to the Presidents of the Council of State and of the Legislative Assembly respectively. These gentlemen would be official guests of the United Kingdom Government and, as such, would be invited to the various functions. It is possible that they might desire to present Addresses at St. James&apos;s Palace.Expenses of Official Guests.16. We contemplate that in the case of each person invited to attend the London Celebrations as an official guest of the Government, the invitation will include his wife and one Private Secretary or other Assistant.17. The period for which official guests should enjoy Government hospitality should be from Saturday, the 4th May, 1935, to the end of May inclusive.18. Only expenses incurred in London by official guests should be met by the Exchequer, which should not be liable for other expenses, e.g., travelling expenses to and from London.Overseas Contingents.19. Very heavy expense would be involved if Contingents from the Dominions, the Colonies and India were invited to participate in the Celebrations in London, and in view of the considerations mentioned in paragraph 3 above we recommend that no invitations to Overseas Contingents should be issued.Clemency to Prisoners.20. We concur with the view of the Home Office and the Scottish Office that proposals involving clemency to prisoners in connection with the Anniversary Celebrations are open to grave objection, and we cannot therefore recommend that such proposals should be entertained.New Stamp Issue and Medal.21. We understand that the Postmaster-General proposes to make a special issue of postage stamps (three or four) in connection with the Celebrations, and that the Prime Minister has under consideration a special commemorative medal.Sketch Programme for the London Celebrations.22. We attach (Appendix I) a draft sketch programme of the suggested Celebrations in London and the Naval, Military and Air Force Reviews.   This[10197] B 2
draft is based on the draft submitted by the Lord Chamberlain to the Cabinet Committee at their Meeting on the 7th June. The main differences between the two drafts are that in our draft the events have been spread out over a somewhat longer period and further curtailed.Monday, May 6 (Bank Holiday).23.   Noon. Thanksgiving Service at St. PauVs Cathedral.Processional Drive to and from St. PauVs.6 p.m. The King&apos;&apos;&apos;s Broadcast Message to the Empire.Evening. Family Dinner at Buckingham Palace. Illuminations.Bank Holiday. Notes.24. It will be necessary to declare by Proclamation Monday, the 6th May, 1935, to be a Bank Holiday. The arrangements in regard to the necessary Order in Council will be made by the Treasury. We attach (Appendix II) a draft of the required Proclamation.Thanksgiving Service.25. The Thanksgiving Service should be of a fully national and repre-sentative character. We assume that it will be attended by Their Majesties, the Royal Family and a representative congregation, including : (1) Privy Councillors, Members of both Houses of Parliament and their wives.(2) The Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished foreigners.(3) The Dominion Prime Ministers and other official guests.(4) Other representatives from the Dominions, Colonies and India.(5) Lord Lieutenants and High Sheriffs of Counties.(6) Representatives of the Church and Non-Conformist Bodies.(7) Representatives of Navy, Army, Royal Air Force, Royal Marines, Terri-torial and Reserve Forces, Civil Service and Mercantile Marine. (8) Representatives of the Learned Professions.(9) Lord Mayors and Mayors, Lord Provosts and Provosts, Chairmen of County Councils. (10) Representatives of Trade, Commerce and Agriculture. (11) Representatives of Organised Labour.All arrangements in regard to the invitations,. &amp;o, for the Service will be made by the Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Department.26. An Order of Council, for the draft of which see Appendix III, will be necessary, directing the Archbishop of Canterbury to prepare the Form of Service. The same Form will be used in the Thanksgiving Services to be held in all the Established Churches throughout England and Wales. A similar Order of Council (for draft see Appendix IV) will be required for Scotland.27. St. pauls Cathedral will seat about 5,000 persons if no special measures are taken to erect stands, &amp;c. The cost of erecting stands would be about  10,000. We suggest that the number of persons invited to the Thanksgiving Service should be adjusted to the normal seating capacity of the Cathedral, thus avoiding the expense of providing additional seating. The cost of arranging the Cathedral for the service will fall on the Exchequer.Processional Drive to and from St. PauVs.28. We submit the following recommendations regarding the Royal Processional Drive to and from St. pauls Cathedral on Monday, the 6th May : (a) The Drive to St. pauls should follow the route Constitutional Hill,Piccadilly, St. James&apos;s Street, Pall Mall, Trafalgar Square and the Strand.(b) The return route should be from the South side of St. Paul&apos;s viaCannon Street to Mansion House Station, and then via Queen Victoria Street, Embankment, Northumberland Avenue, Admiralty Arch and the Mall.
(c) The Drive would be at a trot, the 1902 State Landau with six trotting horses probably being employed. In any case the Gold Coach would not be employed.id) Personnel of all three Services, though not taking part in the Procession, would line the route, all three Services contributing detachments for this purpose (including probably contingents from the Territorial Army, the R.N.V.R. and the Auxiliary Air Force).(e) Guards of Honour would be provided at Buckingham Palace and St. paul&apos;s. Subject to The King&apos;s approval, the Guards would be composed of all three Services. They would be Full Guards, subject to reconsideration in the case of the Guard at St. Paul&apos;s from the point of view of the space available.(/) There would be the usual Sword Ceremony at the City Boundary.Suggested Reception at the Guildhall..29. We gather that it would give the greatest possible satisfaction to the Corporation of the City of London if The King would consent to attend a banquet or luncheon at Guildhall or to receive the City&apos;s Address there, either after the Thanksgiving Service on the 6th May or on some other date. We have made no provision for this suggestion in the draft programme, but we understand that His Majesty&apos;s wishes in regard to it will be ascertained.Stands on routes of Processional Drives.30. The Office of Works should be authorised to arrange for the provision and financing of stands to be erected along the lines of the routes of the Processional Drive on the 6th May and the other Processional Drives. In any case the stands should pay for themselves, no charge falling upon public funds. The questions of the form which the financing should take and whether the work should be done by the Office of Works direct or by semi-official organisations on behalf of official charities, will be settled by the Office of Works in consultation with the Treasury.Broadcast Message to the Empire.31. The arrangements for His Majesty&apos;s Broadcast Message to the Empire will be made by the Lord Chamberlain&apos;s Office with the B.B.C.Illuminations, &amp;c.32. A very rough estimate of the cost of flood-lighting the more important Government buildings in London is  8,000 plus  2,000 for decorations. In addition there will be a good deal of local authority and private expenditure on these services.   An official firework display would cost about  10,000.33. We recommend that a sum of not more than  10,000 in all should be included in the estimate of cost in respect of illuminations and decorations, and that there should be no official firework display.34. We also recommend that, in order to lessen the strain on the Police Forces, the period of flood-lighting should be limited to a week, i.e., from Monday, the 6th May, to Saturday, the 11th May, inclusive. It may be noted that, once the expenditure on the installation of flood-lighting apparatus has been incurred, the additional cost of the current for a few extra days is insignificant.35. His Majesty&apos;s wishes in regard to the flood-lighting of Buckingham Palace will be ascertained.Wednesday, May 8.36.   Morning. Reception at St. James&apos;s Palace. (1) Diplomatic Corps.(2) Representatives from the Dominions and India and on behalf of the Colonial Empire.(3) Northern Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Representatives.
Notes.Reception at St. James&apos;s Palace.37. We are informed that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, all the foreign Ambassadors, Ministers and Charges d&apos;Affaires should be received at the Palace, that credentials should be presented through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and that one Address only should be presented and read by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps on behalf of the whole Corps, to which Address The King might be pleased to reply.38. Addresses would, we assume, be presented by the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and of Southern Rhodesia, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on behalf of the Colonial Empire, by the Representatives of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and possibly also by the Presidents of the two Indian Chambers.Drive to St. James&apos;s Palace.39. We have considered the suggested Drive to St. James&apos;s Palace on Wednesday, the 8th May. This proposal is at present at a very preliminary stage, and before any recommendations on points of detail can be made, The King&apos;s wishes will have to be ascertained. In the event of the Drive taking place, it would probably be as in the case of a Levee, a Captain&apos;s escort being provided.Thursday, May 9.40.   Morning. Presentation of Addresses by both Houses of Parliament. Evening. State Banquet.It has been suggested that the two Houses should present their Addresses in Westminster Hall. His Majesty&apos;s wishes in regard to this suggestion will have to be ascertained. In the event of the suggestion being adopted, it can probably be assumed that the Processional Drive to Westminster Hall would follow the route used in the case of the Ceremony of the Opening of Parliament. This might be a suitable occasion for His Majesty to receive an Address from the City of Westminster. The Office of Works would be responsible for the preparation of Westminster Hall for the Ceremony, and would consult with the Lord Great Chamberlain and the Speaker as required.Friday, May 10. 11U1M&apos;41. In the original sketch programme it was suggested that a Processional Drive through the City and South London should take place on the afternoon of the 10th May. We understand that it is felt that the route proposed was much too long, and we submit for consideration an alternative proposal, namely, that the Drive through South London should be combined with the River Progress on the 18th May. If adopted, this suggestion will make Friday, the 10th May, a &quot;free &quot;day.Saturday, May 11.42.   Afternoon. Drive through North London to  Wembley Children&apos;sFete at Wembley Stadium.Notes.We are informed that the Drive could be undertaken if it took the form of a motor drive to a suitable point where The King could change into a carriage, and from there drive to the Wembley Stadium. At some point on the route His Majesty might receive a Collective Address from the Metropolitan Boroughs north of the Thames. The route to be followed would be arranged on the lines of that followed on a previous occasion when The King went to Wembley.43. It is proposed to make the principal feature of this event a Children&apos;s Fete at Wembley Stadium. We recommend that the children should be drawn from an area to be determined by the Board of Education, and that the general arrangements in regard to the marshalling, &amp;c, of the children and the organisation of the Fete should be entrusted to a Committee composed of
representatives of the appropriate Local Education Authorities in that area. This Committee to settle the quota of children to attend from the area of each Authority. We assume that it is the intention that the Fete should take the form of displays, e.g., athletic, choral, gymnastic and games, and that, for the most part, the spectators in the Stadium, like the performers, will be children.44. The cost of hiring and adapting the Stadium for the purpose will be borne by the Office of Works. The expenses of transporting the children to and from Wembley, supervision, &amp;o, will be borne by the Local Education Authorities concerned, and we are assured that this expenditure will rank for grant from the Board of Education.Sunday, May 12.45.   Thanksgiving Services in all Churches.Note.The Services in the Established Churches in England and Wales will be in the form prepared by the Archbishop of Canterbury as required by the Order of Council (Appendix III).The Services in the Church of Scotland and in the Scottish Episcopal Communion are provided for in the corresponding Order of Council applicable to Scotland (Appendix IV).Monday, May 13.46.   Morning. Presentation at St. James&apos;s Pcdace of Addresses from Privileged Bodies.(Church of England Universities Royal Society.) Addresses from other Privileged Bodies.(Non-Conformists City of London, London County Council.)Notes.We understand that public opinion in Scotland would be highly gratified if the Addresses from the Scottish Privileged Bodies could be presented in Scotland. These presentations might take place in Edinburgh if it is found possible to hold a Territorial Review near there. Alternatively, the Addresses might be presented at Balmoral. Subject to the above we suggest that all the Privileged Bodies should be received in the morning, their Addresses being handed, in which case no oral Reply by The King would be required.We have omitted from our list of Privileged Bodies the Corporation of Dublin and the University of Dublin in view of the fact that the Irish Free State now has full Dominion status. If, however, either of these bodies should ask leave to present an Address, as they are entitled to do, it would appear to be difficult not to allow them.All other Addresses, of which there were over 3,000 in 1897, should be sent through the Home Office, or the Scottish Office, and should receive official replies.Performance at the Opera.47. It was originally suggested that a Gala Performance at the Opera should take place on the evening of the 13th May. These performances involve heavy expense, and it may be thought desirable on this account to dispense with this item.  We have provisionally omitted it from our draft programme.Tuesday, May 14.. 48.   State Ball.Saturday, May 18.49.   River Progress Admiralty vessels Processional Drive through South London.   Naval Visit to Southend and London Docks.Notes.The proposal for a River Progress was originally made by the Lord Chamberlain at the Meeting of the Ministerial Committee on the 7th June, and. was put forward tentatively as the matter had not then been mentioned to
The King. Briefly, the proposal was that The King should proceed down the River in some suitable craft to be supplied by the Admiralty; that he should land at one or two places and that along the River each Borough should feast its unemployed as soon as he had passed either on the river bank or at the nearest convenient spot. In making this suggestion Lord Cromer informed the Committee of His Majesty&apos;s wish that the unemployed should be brought into the Celebrations at some stage.Proposal to Entertain Unemployed.50. We have given very careful consideration to these proposals, and we are satisfied that a River Progress can be organised in conjunction with a short Drive through London. The proposal to entertain the London unemployed raises, however, very serious difficulties. We are advised by the Ministry of Labour that there would be considerable objection to feasting the unemployed in London (where the percentage of unemployed is comparatively low) while leaving out the industrial areas, and in particular the depressed areas where most of the unemployed are to be found and where the percentage often rises to a very high figure. Secondly, even if the scheme was restricted to London, the numbers involved would be enormous. There are in the London area some 200,000 genuine unemployed, and if wives and families were taken into account, this number would be very substantially increased, but there would also be many others who would claim to be classed as unemployed on such an occasion. In the view of the Ministry, which we share, almost insuperable administrative and practical difficulties are involved in the proposal. These difficulties would, if possible, be even graver if, as has been suggested, an organised attempt is made to feast the unemployed throughout the country. If the cost is to be charged to the Exchequer, not only would the amount involved be a very substantial one, but the Government would have to assume full responsibility for the successful conduct of so novel an experiment as the simultaneous feasting of several million persons. Special machinery would have to be improvised, and the elaborate organisation that would be necessary to ensure even a moderate degree of success would be costly and difficult to provide. On the other hand, if the arrangements are left to local effort there will be the widest possible variation in the arrarige-ments made, the richer localities would probably entertain their (comparatively few) unemployed, the poorer and more depressed localities would, as a rule, be quite unable to assume the correspondingly greater financial burden. For these, among other reasons, we feel the gravest possible doubt as to the possibility of attempting to bring the unemployed as such into the Celebrations by entertaining them in the manner suggested.River Progress and Drive through South London.51. It is important that the River Progress should be made as striking and impressive as possible, and we are advised by the Admiralty that this can be done if The King proceeds down the River in a Naval Barge escorted by a Flotilla of Naval Picket Boats followed by three or four more Barges. This will provide an impressive procession having coherence and sufficient speed of movement.52. We suggest that the River Progress should start at Cadogan Pier (adjoining Albert Bridge), which is suitable for embarking, and that The King might land at the Tower Pier, where excellent facilities for disembarking are available.53. Unfortunately the tides, which are a very material factor, will not be very convenient on the 18th May, 1935. On that date the only favourable time would be about 1-30 p.m. if the Progress started from Cadogan Piei\ The passage down the River would occupy about 35 minutes. It is estimated that the number of persons for whom standing room to see the procession could be found along both banks of the River between Cadogan and the Tower Piers, is approximately 250,000, most of whom could view the spectacle from the North side of the River on Chelsea Embankment and between Albert and Blackfriars Bridges and in Battersea Park from the south side.54. On disembarking, at the ToAver Pier, The King might take a short processional Drive via Tower Hill, Tower Bridge Approach, over Tower Bridge.
New Kent Road, London Road to St. George&apos;s Circus, where collective Addresses might be presented by the South London Boroughs. The return might be via Westminster Bridge and Birdcage Walk. This drive (from Tower Pier to Buckingham Palace) would occupy about 45 minutes.Visit of Naval Vessels to Southend.55. We suggest that the Admiralty should be invited to arrange for a number of His Majesty&apos;s Ships to visit Southend, the visit to-synchronise, if possible, with the suggested River Progress. The ships might remain for about a week and give searchlight displays in the evenings. It- might also be possible, by arrangement with the Port of London Authority, for destroyers, and possibly cruisers, to proceed up the River to the Docks, where facilities might be given for the public to visit them.Reviews. -56. The London Celebrations would end with the suggested River Progress and Processional Drive on the 18th May, and it only remains to indicate the possible dates and places of the Naval, Military and Air Force Reviews.(a) The Naval Review should take place at Spithead on a convenient datebetween the 15th and 20th July.(b) The Army Review would, if The King approved, be at Aldershot.Mechanised units would be present; but the infantry might perhaps have to be limited. Army Co-operation Squadrons of the Royal Air Force would be present and co-operate. It seems desirable that the date of the Army Review should be between the 8th and 13th July in order not to clash with other Army and Air Force displays and to give sufficient time after the Tattoo for practice.(c) The suggestion has been made that there might be a Review ofTerritorials in Scotland. The Territorials would normally be in camp in the last week in July and the first week in August, but there would be some latitude as to these dates. We mention this suggestion in case an opportunity should offer of holding the Review if The King decided to stay in Scotland about that time. Any such visit by The King might afford a suitable opportunity for the presentation of Addresses by the Privileged Bodies in Scotland.(d) The Air Force Review would most conveniently take place on the 4th or5th July, i.e., approximately a week after the Hendon Air Display. If the Review takes place in the vicinity of London it would have to be considerably restricted and, subject to the King&apos;s approval, it would probably best be held on Salisbury Plain. It is suggested that the Review, for which there were no full precedents, might take the form of an inspection on the ground, exhibition flying, and squadrons flying past in formation.British Legion.57. We are informed that the Prime Minister has been approached by the British Legion with a suggestion that a Review of the Legion should take place next year in Hyde Park or the White City in connection with the Anniversary Celebrations. As the King&apos;s wishes in regard to this proposal have not been ascertained we have made no reference to it in our sketch programme. We also refrain from making any comment on the proposal beyond pointing out that any project for bringing members of the Legion from the Provinces to London would run counter to our general recommendations in paragraphs 3 and 7.Financial A rrangements.58. The most recent precedents for the financial arrangements are those of the Jubilee of 1887, the Diamond Jubilee of 1897 and the Coronation in 1911. In 1887,  17,000 was voted for the preparation of Westminster Abbey for the Thanksgiving Service, while other expenditure was charged to various Votes. In 1897,  80,000 was voted covering expenditure on the Civil List, and expenditure incurred by the Colonial Office, India Office and Office of Works, whilst the expenditure incurred by the Admiralty and War Office was borne on Navy and
Army Votes respectively. In 1911,  185,000 was voted, but here again the Votes of the Service Departments carried the naval and military charges.59. It may be noted that on the occasions in question a large part of the expenditure charged to Votes was in respect of the cost of hospitality extended to the large number of foreign and Empire official guests, overseas contingents and the like. On the present occasion it is not contemplated that contingents from overseas will be present, and it is assumed that the total number of official guests will be comparatively small.60.  Caving regard to the difficulty of identifying particular items of expenditure incurred by the Defence Departments as directly attributable to the celebrations, we think it is desirable to follow the course adopted in 1897 and 1911, and we accordingly suggest that (subject to the exception referred to below) the expenditure incurred by the Defence Departments in connection with the celebra-tions should be charged to Navy, Army and Air Votes. We recommend that all other expenditure directly incurred by the Exchequer should be charged to a single Civil Vote. As this expenditure will mainly be incurred by the Office of Works, we recommend that it should be charged to a special Vote accounted for by that Department. We also recommend that the cost of entertaining official guests at the Reviews (estimated to amount to about  4,000) should be charged to the special Vote.61. As regards allocation of expenditure between the Civil List and the Exchequer, it has been suggested to us that all expenditure within the Royal Palaces should be borne by the Civil List, and that all other expenditure should be charged to Votes. We agree with the Treasury that this would be a suitable basis of allocation.Estimate of Cost.62. There are so many uncertain factors that it is very difficult to estimate even approximately, the cost of a programme of Celebrations such as is outlined in this Report. Apart, however, from any extra cost to the Defence Votes for the Reviews, and some small increase of Exchequer grants which would be attracted by Local Authority expenditure, we think that the sums directly incurred by the Exchequer and chargeable to the Special Vote should not exceed  40,000 in all, and might be materially less if our recommendations are generally accepted.Signed on behalf of the Committee :R.
