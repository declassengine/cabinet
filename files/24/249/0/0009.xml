jjs nOHTMFiNT IS THE PROPERT^ OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;3 GOVERNIuUNT) .SECRET. CP. 120(34).CABINET.Indian Legislative Assembly&quot; Question of holding Elections in the Autumn or extending its life.Memorandum by the Secretary ef J3istel.for^ndia.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the Viceroy&apos;s reply to the telegram sent as a result of the Cabinet discussion last Wednesday.    I propose to bring up at the meeting of the Cabinet on Monday, 30th April, a draft reply to this telegram for the consideration of the Cabinet.S H28th April 1934.Telegram from Viceroy,26th April 19^4.Private and personal.   I have consulted my colleagues and our views remain unaltered. We feel that you exaggerate the differences which will be made by election as regards effect of public expression of opinion. Accurate appreciation is difficult in ignorance of final form of report but I suppose I may assume that it will be definitely less liberal than White Paper.    In that case if there is no election, there will certainly be organised meetings and demonstrations throughout the country, with moderates like Sapru quite possibly appearing on the same platform as Congress. Such demonstrations will be widely reported in the press, and must make considerable impression in England. To this it is hardly possible to expect any effective counter move from supporters in the Assembly. We must contemplate that several of the more important members will voluntarily seek re-election and, if we can avoid adverse vote in the Assembly, majority on our side will be entirely dependent on official votes and on small attendance of non-officials.   Y/e could not rely on obtaining nominated votes andquiteCopy No.
quite possibly not on all Europeans.    I cannot believe that your opponents will not be able to show up the complete insignificance of such a victory while if as is quite probable even the present Assembly condemns the plan the effect will be much more damaging. On the other hand, if v/e have the elections we force Congress to show their hand and possibly disclose internal differences while we shall probably get a fair number of the more sensible into the Assembly. With such a result it will be possible for me to get into personal contact, in a constitutional manner, with reasonable Congress opinion and, if I can make then realise that violent condemnation in the Assembly will wreck all chances of any Bill in Parliament, it is not at all improbable that they will regulate their action to avoid such a result. I therefore come back to my fundamental position which is that on broad grounds wiser and right course is to hold the elections now.
