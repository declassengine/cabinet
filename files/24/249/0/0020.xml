Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 132 (34). ^(Revise.) AJ 2 .CABINET._ ;  iio;.)REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OE ARMAMENTS.The Question of Security.Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.(As amended and approved by the Cabinet at their Meeting on May 9, 1934-Cabinet 20 (34), Conclusion 2.)IN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 22nd March, 1934 (Cabinet 12 (34), Conclusion 1), we have considered at a series of meetings the question of Security, as well as the attitude to be adopted by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the forthcoming meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference at Geneva.2. We remain convinced that the British Draft Convention, suitably amended in accordance with the recent conversations, provides the best basis for international disarmament. Nevertheless, we see but little prospect of any useful result following from a continuance of the Disarmament Conference on present lines at Geneva, as the French Government take the line that France cannot sign an agreement that will provide for German rearmament. On the other hand. Germany will accept no agreement that does not provide for German rearmament. Further, progress cannot be made so long as Germany remains unrepresented at the Conference and the German Government declines to return to Geneva. Yet. if the Disarmament Conference dissolves, there is a grave danger that Germany may take some overt action in the direction of rearmament which may render impossible further efforts to keep the peace in Europe.3. In these circumstances we have sought some method by which Germany might be brought back into some form of joint consultation or conference outside the Disarmament Conference, and various proposals have been submitted to us with this object. The most comprehensive proposal is one by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, designed to promote international investigation of some plan of partnership of European Powers in a system of mutual guarantees in which the liability of each partner would be limited. We have devoted several meetings to this subject, and have received Reports thereon from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the Secretary to the Cabinet. These authorities have brought to our notice the difficulties that have attended previous efforts in this direction, including some half-dozen schemes of mutual guarantee formulated since the War, and have expressed grave doubts as to whether an effective and reliable scheme could be produced. While we realise that the difficulties are very great and would require much time to surmount, Ave do not accept their view as final. We think, however, that it would be unwise for the Delegates of the United Kingdom to take the initiative in opening this question at Geneva until the Government had satisfied itself that a defensible and effective scheme could be produced. Otherwise there might be a repetition of what occurred at Geneva last year over the question&quot; of the abolition of naval and military air forces and the international control of civil aviation, when the United Kingdom Delegates, after proposing that the question should be examined by a Committee, found themselves in the embarrassing position of having to criticise and oppose other [10018] &apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Delegations&apos; schemes without being in a position to put forward constructive proposals of their own.4. The present attitude of public opinion in this country towards further military commitments on the Continent of Europe is also a factor that has.to be taken into consideration in this connection.5. An alternative proposal, submitted tentatively by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was that we should propose that European States should enter into an undertaking (i) not to drop bombs on each other&apos;s territory in Europe; and (ii) that, if anyone should violate the Convention by dropping bombs on foreign territory in Europe, the whole of the air forces of European States would be employed against them. This proposal also was found, on preliminary investigation, to require further examination.6. We cannot, at the moment, recommend any initiative to be taken by the United Kingdom Delegation on the lines of either of the above proposals. It is quite uncertain what lines the French may adopt at Geneva on the 29th May, but, in view of France&apos;s rejection of the suggestions put forward by the United Kingdom in the memorandum of the 29th January and subsequent communications, it would be natural to look to France, which has rejected our suggestions, to.make positive proposals of her own. If the French or any other Delegation proposes further discussion on security with a view to the establishment of more peaceful conditions in Europe, the British Delegation should indicate its willingness to join in such discussion, but it should emphasise the importance of providing for a method of discussion which would bring Germany into conference.7.   Our recommendations to the Cabinet are as follows : (1) That the United Kingdom Delegates at the forthcoming meeting of theGeneral Commission of the Disarmament Conference at Geneva should work on the following lines : (a) They should recall our own efforts in the cause of disarmament, emphasising the importance of the British Draft Convention and the British Memorandum of the 29th January.(We are not in a position at present to offer any further constructive proposals which the United Kingdom Delegation could put forward at Geneva.)(b) If the French Delegation take the line that, owing to the attitude of Germany, the British Draft Convention, with its proposed amendments, cannot form the basis of a Disarmament Agreement, and suggest instead a discussion on Security in general, this country should agree to take part, though the Delegates might call attention to the difficulties that have been met with in the past. They should also take such action as may be appropriate to encourage the French Delegation to take the lead.(c) They should also make clear, in whatever manner may be most convenient, that Germany must be drawn into such discussions if any fruitful results are to be obtained. Consequently, if a discussion on Security should be proposed, it should not take place at the Disarmament Conference, but outside the Conference.(2) If it is found that France attaches importance to our reaffirmation of our obligations under the Treaty of Locarno, a suitable opportunity might be sought, whether at Geneva or elsewhere, to make a statement to this effect, adding that we are unable to enter into any further commitments of that character. The possibility should be borne in mind of obtaining, in return for such a declaration, a quid pro quo from France in the form of the admission of German representatives to any discussions on Security.(Initialled)      J. S.(Acting Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, May 9, 1934.
