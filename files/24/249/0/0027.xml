Memorandum by the Home Secretary.On Monday, May 6th,  1935,  The King will have reigned for 25 years and,  as my Colleagues are aware,   there is an Empire-wide desire to celebrate the occasion in a becoming manner.      Inquiries have already been received from some of the Dominions as to the form which the celebrations here are likely to take and to these inquiries it is not possible to give any reply until at least the main features of the programme are decided upon.I would suggest therefore the setting up of a small Committee consisting of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,  the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India,  the Pirst Commissioner of Works and myself, while I would further suggest that the Lord Chamberlain should be invited to attend the Committee&apos;s meetings.      This Committee might meet forthwith and formulate a scheme for consideration by the Cabinet.      The King&apos;s Pleasure would then be taken and if the main proposals made were approved by His Majesty they might be communicated to the Dominions before the Recess.J.G .15th May,  1934 .
