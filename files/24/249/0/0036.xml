THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,   June 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 149 (34).CABINET.THE REGULATION OF WHALING.Legislation to Ratify Convention.Memorandum by the Secretary of,State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries.IT has long been apparent that there was need for the international regulation of whaling to prevent such a reduction of the stock of whales as would make whaling unremunerative. Experience in Arctic waters showed that the risk of over-exploitation was real, and although in the more extensive and open seas of the Antarctic the probability of the extermination of any species of whale, such as had occurred in the Arctic, was remote, the annual slaughter of whales was such as to arouse great apprehension lest the industry of whaling might be brought to an end in the course of a few years.2. Great Britain and the Falkland Islands and their Dependencies are most closely interested in the whaling industry, but several Dominions are also concerned. For a generation and more Norway has been predominant in the prosecution of whaling, but Great Britain and the Empire overseas have latterly taken an increasing part in the industry. The Committee on Polar Questions of the 1930 Imperial Conference unanimously agreed that the future of the industry was menaced by the existing scale of operations, and that protective measures were urgently required.3. The necessity for regulation was also recognised by the Norwegians, and some years ago they passed legislation, mainly inspired by the regulations of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, with which they were familiar, imposing regulations upon their own vessels to protect certain species of whales which had already become rare, to prohibit the destruction of immature whales, and to require that such whales as were killed should be utilised as completely as possible, instead of the wasteful practice which had hitherto been adopted of using only the richest and most easily convertible parts of the whale, and throwing away the rest.4. For many years it was impossible to produce whale oil satisfactorily except at shore factories or in factory ships anchored in sheltered coves. Since the Falkland Islands Dependencies afford the facilities required, it was possible to keep a certain control of whaling in the Antarctic through a system of leases for shore stations and licences for whaling vessels. Later, however, the practice arose of taking to the Antarctic large factory ships, equipped with means by which the whole carcases can be dragged on board and there treated. These ships are able to work in the shelter of the ice pack and thus to dispense with the facilities afforded by the Falkland Islands Dependencies and their territorial waters. This is what is known as the &quot; pelagic &quot; system of whaling. The old means of control has, therefore, been largely lost, since only a few shore stations remain in operation.[10102]
5. After long negotiations between experts under the auspices of the Economic Committee of the League of Nations, a Convention^ for the protection of whales, which follows very closely the lines of the Norwegian legislation, and is designed to ensure some control of whaling outside territorial waters, was signed by the representatives of a great number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India, on the 24th September, 1931. The Convention provides that it shall enter into force on the ninetieth day following the receipt by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations of ratifications or accessions on behalf of not less than eight Members of the League or non-member States, including the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (as the countries chiefly concerned with whaling).6. The United Kingdom and Norway played a prominent part in the negotiations leading to the signature of the Convention, and their representatives at Geneva exerted their efforts -to secure its widest possible adoption. Sixteen ratifications or accessions, besides that of Norway, have already been deposited, but, although it is now 2^ years since the Convention was signed, the United Kingdom has not yet ratified it and, until it is so ratified, it does not come into force. Its provisions are, however, in practice enforced on Norwegian ships, and for some time past the Norwegian Government have been making pressing-representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government to deposit their ratification, and so bring the Convention into force. Recent communications from them have been marked by increasing irritation at the delay, and a semi-official assurance has quite recently been given to the Norwegian Minister by the Foreign Office, that a Bill for the ratification of the Convention will be introduced into Parliament this summer, and that every effort will be made to expedite its passage.7. The Imperial Conference Committee welcomed the Convention, and there is general agreement that, so far as it goes, it is a useful measure, and a step in the right direction. War time experience proved the importance to the Empire of the whaling industry, which naturally depends for its continuance on the preservation of an adequate stock of whales. It is becoming increasingly difficult to explain the delay in ratifying a Convention the signature of which was so strongly advocated by this country. It seems, therefore, as much our duty as our interest to ratify. To enable us to do this, an Act of Parliament is required authorising the licensing of whaling ships by the competent Departments of the Government. Ships will then be licensed only on condition of complying with the requirements of the Convention.  The necessary Bill is now in draft.For the above reasons it appears essential that this legislation should be introduced immediately, and an endeavour made to secure its passage through Parliament during the present session.We have consulted the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, Dominion Affairs and the Colonies, and the President of the Board of Trade, and have ascertained that they concur in the terms of this memorandum.(Initialled) G. .C.W, E.
