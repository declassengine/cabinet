THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1934.SECRET.Copy No.  O (CP. 133 (34).CABINET.1LIBERIA.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a record of some conclusions reached, in the Foreign Office as to the line which should be taken on this subject at the approaching meeting of the Council, and hope that I may assume that the Cabinet will concur.May 9, 1934.At a conference to-day with Mr. Eden, Lord Stanhope and officials of the Foreign Office, we discussed the line to be taken at the approaching Council of the League on the subject of Liberia. At the January meeting of the Council, when Liberia was expected to give her answer as to the League plan for her assistance, her representative temporised, and he was told that, as a last chance, Liberia would have the opportunity of withdrawing her reservations to the plan (which, if persisted in, would make it quite inoperative) and of accepting it without reservation at the May meeting. There is no sign that Liberia will accept the plan, and we are clear that no further opportunity should be given to her to postpone the decision. Consequently, the Council ought to register the conclusion that the League plan is rejected by Liberia herself and that the League can hold out no hope of assistance on other terms. If necessary, our represen-tative will strongly support this attitude.Now comes the more difficult question as to what to do next. We think that the United Kingdom representative should take the opportunity of reviewing this miserable story and bringing out, for public information, how hopeless the conduct of Liberia has been and how scandalous is the administration for which the Liberian Government is responsible. It would be useful to recall that the United States, as long ago as June 1929, in a note to the Liberian Government, called attention to &quot; reliable evidence &quot; of the existence of &quot;a system hardly distinguishable from organised slave trade, in the enforcement of which the services of the Liberian frontier forces and of certain high Government officials are constantly and systematically used.&quot; The Christy Commission confirmed the worst allegations; the Brunot Commission made recommendations which were never attended to; Dr. Mackenzie, of the Health Section of the League, found that native tribes, comprising some 12,000 men, women and children, had been driven into the Bush and were in an advanced state of starvation; and Liberia is hopelessly bankrupt. She cannot help herself and she will not allow the League to help her.We think that the United Kingdom representative should then make two specific points. The first would be that Liberia, by her conduct, has so grossly failed to observe the obligations attaching to her as a member of the League, that the League would be quite entitled to consider her expulsion under Article 16, paragraph 4. It would not, of course, be possible to propose Liberia&apos;s expulsion forthwith, for this would require notice and Liberia would be entitled to be heard.  Neither, indeed, is it altogether likely that every member of the Council7402   [10020]J. S.
would favour expulsion. But the House of Lords Debate on the 25th April reflects the strength of feeling on this subject in quarters which are interested, and, if suitable language is chosen, the warning, we think, might be valuable  especially in view of the second point which we think the United Kingdom representative should make in his speech.The second point would be that the British Government is not prepared to leave the whole matter in abeyance without making an effort in another direction, and that we propose to address the United States on the subject. There is, in fact, a despatch already prepared in draft for this purpose, but it would be better not to send it until after the outcome of the League meeting is known. The United States have taken an interest in Liberia throughout, and the United States Embassy have just been enquiring as to our view for the future, after the recent Debate in the House of Lords. The State Department, therefore, would not resent our turning to them as long as we invite their views and indicate our willingness to co-operate in any way we can in what is primarily a humanitarian crusade. Lord Stanhope promised the House of Lords that a White Paper would be issued after the Geneva meeting, and the proposed despatch would find a suitable place in it. If we show that we think that the time has come for Liberia to be dealt with outside the League of Nations, we are more likely to get a sympathetic answer from Washington.J. S.Foreign Office, May 9, 1934.
