EjIS DOCUHENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSRNMEKT.) . SECRET.Copy Mo.  i -CP. 115(34). /CABINET.Indian Legislative Assembly:   Question of holding Election in the Autumn or extending Its life.Memorandum by, the Secretary of State for Indis.With a view to the discussion of this subject in the Cabinet on Wednesday, I circulate copies of the telegram which I sent to the Viceroy after the discussion in the Cabinet last Wednesday and of the Viceroy&apos;s reply *S.H.23rd Hav- 1934.Telegram to Viceroy. lSth April 1,93.4* 977&apos; Private and personal.   Your private and personal telegram of 12th April, 239-S.    I could not reply until I had had an opportunity of consulting my colleagues.    I put to them this morning your arguments for an election in the Autumn, as stated in your telegram. We sll admitted the strength of your case, but we all felt that the over-riding consideration at this stage is to secure the passage of the Bill next year, end that the considerations you have in mind, important as they are, should be subordinated to it.   The election would be held in an atmosphere highly critical of the report of the Joint Select Committee and would probably result in a Legislature openly protesting against the Government&apos;s policy. This would supply the die-hards here and other critics with just the ammunition that they need.   We all felt that this would almost certainly be fatal to the Bill,   The case in your telegram rests to some extent on theassumption
assumption that the White Paper will stand substantially as drafted.    It is practically certain that this assumption will not be fulfilled, as you will see when you get my letter of last week. This information and the details of my letter you will understand are for your own information only.   You will see the importance of this if only because of the privilege incident in the Commons on Monday.In what I have said above, I have not in any way exaggerated the strong feeling of the Cabinet in the matter, and I hope that, in spite of all the disadvantages at your end, which we fully admit, you will agree that, in view of the magnitude of the political difficulties here, the only course is to postpone the election.Telegram from Viceroy, 19th April 1934.Private and personal.    I have discussed your private and personal telegram 977? 18th April, with my colleagues and, whilst we fully appreciate the difficulties of the political situation at home, we feel that we cannot agree to the decision of the Cabinet without pointing out once more that we are of opinion that you are making a very serious mistake in forcing us to extend the life of the Assembly.    I must admit that I am gravely alarmed at what you say about changes in the White Paper, but when discussing your telegram with my colleagues I did not read the relevant paragraph but merely hinted, in course of the discussion, that we could, not assume that the White Paper would stand as drafted.    It is however impossible to gauge effect in India of the changes to which you refer until I know more about them, but from what you say it would seem probable that even members of present Assembly would be unable to support the scheme as
as it will emerge and surely condemnation of scheme by what is admitted to be a moderate Assembly would give far more powerful ammunition to clie-hards than condemnation by Swaraj Party, presuming they capture majority of seats, who have already declared themselves as definitely opoosed to the White Paper as it stands and would be much more strongly opposed to it if it were modified.   If Joint Select Committee report is felt to be unsatisfactory in the country, the pressure of public opinion on present Assembly members will be very strong]., particularly if it is argued - as it certainly will be - that they have been kept in existence merely to register decisions of the Government. Moreover, several of the opposition members have already in private conversation expressed their intention of resigning their seats in the event of there not being a general election and of seeking re-election on the issue of condemnation of the Joint Select Committee report if unsatisfactory which would produce in a large degree same effect as a general election. We have to consider the- Congress situation. At present our policy has triumphed. Congress appears to be in chastened mood and there are at least large number of them genuinely anxious to resume constitutional activities and enter the Legislature. This is a development which we should welcome.    It is unhealthy to have a large body of political opinion practically outlawed without prospect of normal means of constitutional expression. Sooner or later, if Constitution is to work?, ordinary constitutional contacts must be resumed and they are good for both sides.    If we now refuse this opportunity to Congress, slamming the door in their face just as they are tentatively knocking on it, it will embitter situation greatly and will make our future task much more difficult. From point of view of Indian political situation of next few years this is a very critical moment, and a mistake such as we are firmly convinced this would be, is likely to have far-reachingand
-r *and irretrievable results.In view of the gr&amp;sity with which I look upon the position, I have decided to cause an announcement to be made in the Assembly on Saturday to the effect that I have not yet been able to reach a decision on the matter, but that I will do so before the end of this month. This will give you time to consider with all care what I have said in this telegram.
