THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1934....SECRET.Copy No.CP. 122 (34).49CABINET.THE IRISH FREESTATE SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues may like to have for their information the following summary of the principal developments in the Irish Free State since the question of our relations with the Free State was last before the Cabinet in December.2. On the political side, the most important development recently has been the introduction in the Dail, immediately before it adjourned for Easter, of.a Bill for the Abolition of the Senate. A Bill restricting the powers of the Senate, by reducing from 18 to 3 months the period during which it could hold up legislation passed by the Dail, was passed by the Dail last year, but the Senate then adopted an amendment postponing further consideration of the Bill until a Committee of both Houses should have considered and reported on the changes, if any, necessary in the constitution and powers of the Senate.3. The present Bill definitely abolishes the Senate as an element in the Irish Free State Parliament. Mr. de Valera, in introducing the Bill, pointed out that part of the policy of Fianna Fail at the last General Election was the abolition of the Senate as at present constituted, and said that no satisfactory scheme had so far been suggested for alteration of the constitution of the Senate, and that &quot; the Second Chamber, as at present constituted, appears to me to be an absolute menace to this country.&quot; In particular, he referred to the Senate&apos;s rejection of the Bill prohibiting the wearing of political uniforms (see below). Accordingly, he said : &quot; We have come to the conclusion that, whatever may be the ultimate decision as to whether there should or should not be a Second Chamber here, the present Chamber, anyhow, as a preliminary has got to go.&quot;In further explanation of his position, Mr. de Valera said : &quot;If to-morrow we had here the union of this country and there was to be in the Six Counties a certain local Parliament, and we were constituted here an all-Ireland Parliament, a very good case could be made for a Senate on somewhat similar lines (i.e., to that of the United States). That is not the position here at the moment, and we are not finally making the Constitution of this country in this Act.&quot; He also referred to the fact that the Constitution would still contain the King as part of the Oireachtas, and said : &quot;If it were my will, pure and simple, I would eliminate that; but it&apos;cannot be done at the moment. I hope it will be done. I believe ultimately it will mean more for&apos;the peace of this country and good relations with the neighbouring country than are possible under present conditions. I can only hope to see the day when it will be done either by the present Executive, if it gets a mandate for the purpose from the people, or that it will be done by others.&apos;&apos;Political.Proposed Abolition of the Senate.[9981]b
24. As regards the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, it should be observed that the Treaty of 1921 contains no mention of the Senate. Article 1 of the Treaty provides that there is to be a &quot; Parliament having powers to make laws,&quot; but it is nowhere provided in the Treaty that Parliament is to have two Houses. Provision for the Senate, as part of the Irish Free State Parliament, is made in Article 12 of the Irish Free State Constitution, but Article 50 of the Constitution as amended provides for the amendment of the Constitution by way of ordinary legislation; within a period of sixteen years from the coming into operation of the Constitution.Position of the Governor-General. 5. A further step in Mr. de Valera&apos;s policy of minimizing the position of the Governor-General was the alteration in the procedure for presentation of Letters of Credence by foreign diplomatic representatives in the Irish Free State, which attracted some attention recently on the appointment of the late United States Minister at Dublin. Hitherto, such Letters of Credence (which are addressed by the Head of the foreign State to His Majesty the King) have, in the Irish Free State, as in other Dominions, been presented to the Governor-General as the King&apos;s Representative and forwarded by him to His Majesty. Last September, Mr. de Valera made a submission to the King that, in future, such Letters should be presented to the President of the Executive Council instead of the Governor-General. The Attorney-General, who was. consulted informally, thought that the question of the person to whom a Letter addressed to His Majesty should be delivered in Dublin did not raise any issue of constitutional importance (though the King&apos;s Representative would appear to be the natural person to receive such a Letter), and the King&apos;s approval was conveyed by His Majesty&apos;s Private Secretary to the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State, through whom the submission had been forwarded. The presentation by the late United States Minister of his Letter of Credence was the first occasion on which the new procedure was put into effect.6. The important points in this connection would appear to be that the Letter of Credence should be addressed to the King personally, and that the Letter, when presented, should be forwarded to His Majesty. In both these respects the normal procedure was followed in the case of the United States Minister.7. The incident was made the occasion for a speech by Mr. Sean 0&apos;Kelly, Vice-President of the Executive Council, in which he said: &apos;&apos; Every day something is being done to oust British control from the country. Fianna Fail, led by Mr. de Valera, had removed the Oath of Allegiance to a foreign King The American Minister is presenting his credentials to Mr. de Valera. Under Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s Government these letters were presented to the Governor-General as representative of King George. But we have changed that. One by one, great or small, we are cutting the ropes and chains that England wound around us.&quot;* It will, however, be seen from what is said above, that the change of procedure, while undoubtedly part of Mr. de Valera&apos;s policy of reducing the Governor-General to a nonentity, is, from the constitutional point of view, of relatively small importance. It may be remarked that, in an official statement issued by the Irish Free State Department of External Affairs, it was mentioned that J&apos; arrangements to bring about the change were made in the customary constitutional manner.&apos;&apos;8. On the sudden death of the United States Minister, Mr. de Valera notified His Majesty the King through the Irish Free State High Commissioner in London, and His Majesty sent a message of condolence to the President of the United States of America through the Irish Free State Legation at Washington. President roosevelt&apos;s acknowledgment of this message was communicated by the United States Legation at Dublin to the Irish Free State Government, and conveyed by Mr. de Valera to the King through the High Commissioner. On. this occasion, therefore, Mr. de Valera appears to have followed the normal constitutional procedure.* Note. It may be of interest to mention that the Letter of Credence from President Roosevelt to the King refers to &quot; Your Majesty&apos;s Irish Free State &quot; and indicates that the new Minister has been charged to convey to the King and the Government of the Irish Free State J&apos; the best, wishes of this Government for the prosperity of the British Empire.&quot;
The United Ireland Party.9. General 0&apos;Duffy was some time ago summoned to appear before the Military Tribunal set up under the Constitution Amendment Act, passed by Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s Government, on the following charges : (1) Being a member of the Young Ireland Association;(2) Being a member of the National Guard;(3) Sedition, in having urged all young Irishmen to.join the &quot;unlawfulassociation &apos;&apos; known as the Young Ireland Association; (4) Incitement to murder Mr. de Valera; (.5) Attempting to incite murder.10. The question of the competence of the Military Tribunal came before the Irish Free State High Court, which, by a majority, gave a decision last month that the Tribunal had jurisdiction with regard to the charges of being a member of unlawful associations, but that the other charges were not within the competence of the Tribunal. An appeal has been entered on behalf of General 0&apos;Duffy against that part of the High Court decision which held that the Military Tribunal had jurisdiction.11. Another measure directed against the United Ireland party was the Bill prohibiting the wearing of political uniforms. This Bill is of a drastic character, inter alia, giving power to the police to remove in public any prohibited uniform which they see worn. It passed the Dail, but was rejected by the Senate, and its rejection was made the signal for the introduction of the Bill for the abolition of the Senate.12. It may be observed that the Irish Free State Government have not taken any steps recently to interfere with the weekly organ of the new party, i.e.&apos;, the paper called United Ireland, though the Republican organ An Phoblacht was suppressed for several weeks.Economic and Financial.13. The declared policy of the present Irish Free State Government is to advance as rapidly as possible to the ideal of a self-sufficing community. A brief survey of the principal measures directed to this end may be useful. It should be pointed out that the position is complicated by what the Irish Free State Govern-ment call the &quot;economic war&quot; with this country. They maintain that the majority of the measures described below have been introduced primarily for the object described above; but they claim also that the &quot; economic war &quot; has assisted materially in the development of their schemes. Some of the steps are definitely discriminatory against the United Kingdom, while others, though non-discriminatory in form, are no doubt aimed at damaging United Kingdom trade.The Import Trade of the Irish Free State. (A) Tariffs.14. Before the present Government came into office their predecessors were proceeding slowly in the direction of a tariff system for the encouragement of Irish Free State industry. The number of commodities covered by the tariff was, however, comparatively small (75 per cent, of the import trade was free of duty), moreover, protective duties were only levied after full enquiry by a Tariff Commission. Under the present Government the imposition of tariffs was greatly increased, and special measures were taken in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, to widen the powers adopted by the Cosgrave Government for the imposition of tariffs by order. The first action taken under this Act was the imposition of specifically discriminatory duties against certain classes of United Kingdom goods, in particular coal, cement, electrical apparatus, iron and steel manufactures, and sugar. The most important item under this head is coal. The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom to the Irish Free State which, during 1931 and the early part of 1932, was between 45,000 and 50,000 tons a week, has since fallen to an average of between 20,000 and 25,000 tons a week, and is still diminishing.   Supplies of foreign coal which, before the imposition of[9981] b 2
the emergency duty, had been negligible, have since steadily increased until they are now equivalent to nearly 50 per cent, of the total coal imports of the Irish Free State.15. In addition to the special discriminatory duties referred to, the present Irish Free State Government have also widely expanded the range of duties on other goods to cover approximately 50 per cent, of the total range of imports; the general level of the duties is now considerably higher than under the previous Government, and certain preferences which had previously been granted to this country have been withdrawn; the preference on motor cars was withdrawn from all Empire countries.Recently special legislation has been passed to enable specific preferences on future and existing duties to be substituted for different parts of the Empire (or for foreign countries) in return for specific privileges, in lieu of general Empire preference.16. The orders imposing duties regularly contain a special provision allowing duty free importation under licence from the Government. It is believed to be the common practice of the Government to refuse the issue of such licences in favour of imports from the United Kingdom unless the importer is able to show that he cannot obtain the goods required from foreign sources. It is also understood to be the practice of the Irish Free State Ministry of Industry and Commerce to do all they can to influence private concerns to place contracts for machinery, &amp;c, with foreign rather than with British firms.(B) Control of Manufactures Act.17. In 1932 the Control of Manufactures Act was passed (though it was not brought into operation until March 1933). The object of this measure was to control the establishment of new industries in the Irish Free State with a view to ensuring so far as possible that they should be of an Irish Free State character (e.g., one of the requirements is that more than 50 per cent, of the capital should be held by Irish Free State nationals). The provisions of the Act, however, are not such as to prevent the establishment of branch factories by firms in this country, and one or two firms (e.g., Messrs. Cadbury and Fry, the confectionery manufacturers) have already under its provisions been able to set up a branch for manufacture in the Irish Free State. More recently it has been reported that Messrs. Rank, the millers, have joined with an Irish Free State concern to set up a new milling organisation in the Irish Free State, and it is understood that the Dunlop Rubber Company are negotiating with the Irish Free State Govern-ment for the establishment of a factory there. The Irish Manufacturers Convention are, however, pressing for further action with a view to restricting the introduction of businesses which, in effect, are under external control, though complying with the provisions of the Act.(C) Industrial Credit Corf oration.18. By the Industrial Credit Act, 1933, the Irish Free State took power to set up a special Industrial Credit Corporation for the provision of finance for new industries, and to contribute from Government funds a large part of the capital required. The total issue of capital authorised under the Act is  5,000,000, but so far as is known only one issue has so far been made, namely,  500,000 in connection with the arrangement for the development of the beet sugar industry (in connection with this it may be noted that the contract for the machinery required was given mainly to Germany, but partly to Czechoslovakia; in the case of Germany, some return was obtained in the form of an increase of the quota on Irish Free State agricultural produce admitted into Germany).(D) Control of Imports Act.19. The latest step is marked by the Control of Imports Act recently passed. This Act enabled the Government, by a quota order, to prohibit the importation of any particular kind of goods, and to fix quotas for the import of goods from any, or every, country.   The procedure is by the licensing of importers to import
:a certain quantity of goods; the licence may or may not specify the particular country or countries from which the goods may be imported. Irish Free State &apos;&apos; nationals &apos;&apos; will have a right to be &quot; registered &apos;&apos; as importers; but the inclusion of other importers will apparently be at the discretion of the Irish Free State Government. It seems possible that this measure is being brought forward by way of retaliation for the quotas recently imposed here on Irish Free State products e.g., cattle.(E) Effects on United Kingdom Trade.20. The value of the total imports from all sources into the Irish Free State has decreased year by year from  57-Om. in 1930 to  50-5m. in 1931,  42-6m. in 1932 and  36 0m. in 1933. The corresponding figures for imports from the United Kingdom were  45-0m. in 1930,  41-0m. in 1931,  32-6m. in 1932 and  25-0m. in 1933; these figures include the value of goods re-exported from the United Kingdom. It is difficult, on account of the re-export trade from the United Kingdom, to calculate precisely the proportion of the Irish Free State import trade which was accounted for by United Kingdom goods, but it did not exceed the following percentages : 60 per cent, in 1930, 1931 and 1932, and 53 per cent, in 1933. The value of the imports from other countries (British and foreign), which was just under  10m. in 1932, has increased to  10 -75m. in 1933. Of the increase here indicated,  0-5m. is represented by imports from Empire countries, mainly Australia and Canada.(F) Export Trade of the Irish Free State.(a) Restrictions Imposed in the United Kingdom on Irish Free State Goods.21. Special tariffs were imposed in July 1932 under the Irish Free State (Special Duties) Act, 1932, on cattle and the other chief Irish Free State exports to this country, in order to recover the losses sustained by the Irish Free State default on the land annuities, &amp;c.; these duties, though in some cases specific, are now fixed on a general 40 per cent, ad valorem basis. They produced in the year 1932-3 (about 37 weeks) nearly  2,500,000, and in the year 1933-4 nearly  4,400,000. These figures compare with an Irish Free State default of (approxi-mately)  4,800,000 in 1932-3 and  4,900,000 in 1933-4, resulting in an actual cost to the United Kingdom Exchequer of  3,434,000 in 1932-3 and  3,629,000 in 1933-4. Moreover, on the 15th November, 1932, Irish Free State goods became subject to the duties imposed under the Import Duties&apos; Act, 1932; the amount collected under this head up to the 31st March, 1934, is, approximately,  230,000. The maintenance of the level of receipts from duties on Irish Free State goods has largely been due to the bounties granted by the Irish Free State. Apart from bounties on dairy produce given under a special scheme, the Irish Free State have paid in export bounties over  1 million in the year 1932-3 and about  2,500,000 in the year 1933-4.22. It has recently, however, been found necessary in connection with the measures for the improvement of the agricultural situation in this country, and in consequence of schemes prepared under the Agricultural Marketing Act, to consider the question of the imposition of quotas on agricultural products coming from the Irish Free State. The arrangement made has been that in principle Irish Free State products should be treated on a basis intermediate between that accorded to foreign countries and that accorded to other Dominions. Quotas for the Irish Free State have been, or are being, arranged for the Irish Free State in connection with bacon (including live pigs and pork carcases for conversion into bacon), condensed milks and cream and potatoes. The most important item has, however, been the cattle quota, under which imports of fat cattle from the Irish Free State for the first six months of 1934 have been limited to one-half of those in the corresponding period of 1933, while imports of other classes of cattle are limited to the same figure as in 1933.-(b) A ction taken in the Irish Free State as regards Export Trade.23. As mentioned above, the Irish Free State Government, in order to meet the position caused by the United Kingdom special duties, introduced a system of bounties on exports.   These cover all the principal classes of goods subject to
special duty; the amount of bounty is in most cases equivalent to about 50 per cent, of the United Kingdom duty, though in some cases it is higher, even reaching the full amount of the United Kingdom duty. Recently a special step has been taken by. the grant of a bounty of 10s. each on calf-skins. According to press reports, this has led to a wholesale destruction of calves (accompanied by unpleasant scenes), simply for the value of the skins and the bounty, the meat being sold at a nominal price or destroyed; but the press reports are said by the Irish Free State Government to have been greatly exaggerated, and an official statement has been issued by the Free State Government saying that it has been impossible, as the result of an investigation by the Department of Justice, to obtain any evidence that would justify publication of the newspaper reports.24. The other principal steps which the Irish Free State have endeavoured to take in order to get over the difficulties caused by the restrictions imposed in this country have been (a) The attempt to negotiate with foreign countries for the exchange ofagricultural products against manufactured or other goods (see, for example, the arrangement with Germany regarding sugar machinery referred to above).(b) Active measures to promote the change over of agricultural land in theFree State from pasture to arable.(c) The sub-division of large agricultural estates and the establishment ofsmall holdings.No detailed information is, however, available as to the extent to which measures under these three heads have been successful.(G) Effect on Export Trade of the Irish Free State.25. The total export trade of the Irish Free State has decreased from  45,750,000 in 1930 to  37,000,000 in 1931,  27,000,000 in 1932, and just under  19,750,000 in 1933. Of this amount,  42,000,000 came to the United Kingdom in 1930,  35,750,000 in 1931,  26,000,000 in 1932, and  18,500,000 in 1933; the percentage United Kingdom share of the Irish Free State export trade being for the years in question, in 1930, 91-4 per cent., in 1931 and 1932, 96-3 per cent., and in 1933, 94 per cent. The trade figures for the earlier months of 1934 show no marked change except for a decline in exports of Irish Free State cattle to the United Kingdom resulting from the quota restrictions.Government Finance.26. According to the returns for the financial year ended the 31st March, 1934, revenue for the year under review amounted to  30,229,182 and showed an increase of  238,247 over the year 1932-33, while expenditure totalled  31,550,298, making an increase of  2,700,559 over the previous period. These figures reveal a deficit of  1,321,116 for the year as compared with a surplus of  1,141,196 for the previous year. The figures are not, however, drawn up on the same lines as the Budget statement (in which a distinction is drawn between capital expenditure met from loan funds and current expenditure), and, in order to appreciate the position fully, it will be necessary to await the introduction of the Budget. Press comment suggests that, although the actual cash position in the Irish Free State is not unsatisfactory as a result of the borrowing of  6,000,000 during last year, there will be considerable difficulty in balancing the Budget.J.
