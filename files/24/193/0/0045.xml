9^9CShis Document is the Property of His Britannic KajestytsGovernment 3oqrat. CoP&quot;/ Sfo* _.-,96(28). Cabinet.3ill to amend Empire   Settlement let, 1922. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture h Fisheries.I feel bound to call -attention to the objeotions to the proposal of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that he should be given powers to establish centres for the purpose of training men in this oountry for employment in home agriculture,  ( 0.?.95(28)).There is no need for such training, and expenditure on it \would be a waste of public moneye    Tnere is no shortage of labour In the country districtsa    There is already.dy a natural reservoir of country lads brought up in rural surroundings which is more than sufficient to maintain the supply of agricultural workers,,   Agriculture differs fundamentally from manufacturing industry in this respect: it is an extensive and static industry*   A manufacturer can employ more labour by extending his factory and increasing his plante    A farmer is 3.imited to the confines of his farm and he cannot profitably absorb an increasing number cf workersa    On the contrary, the tendency is in the opposite directionc    The greatest economic difficulty of the farmer at the present time is the high cost of labour.    The real solution of this difficulty is to reduce tho labour cost per unit   of production^    It is very likely that this will be achieved by a reduction in the number of men employed^   So long as the birth-rate and deauarate in rural areas remain at their prosent level, agriculture will be unable to find employment for all those born on the land and there will be a flow of population from tho countryside to the towns or overseas cThere
9 0 9fa O other   Is, therefore, no demand inagriculture for unemployed labour from the towns.    This is admitted in Jir. Amery^ memorandum; he states that it .1s unlikely that there frill be any appreciable number of openings for land t-ork in this country and that his proposal will involve the     chequer in little or no expenditure.-;hy, then, set up a scheme for training townsmen to work in agriculture where they are not wanted?   &apos;.&apos;e are told it &quot;is to facilitate recruiting&quot;.   &quot;Hen do not care to be trained for agriculture if their only chance of employment in agriculture after they aro trained is overseas and thousands of miles from hone.&quot;   &quot;Labour leaders find it difficult to support a policy of training for agriculture which holds out no hope of work on the land in this country.&quot;She prospect of work in this country Is therefore to be held out as a bait to the reluctant recruit,although we know beforehand that there is no room for him in home agriculture and that with his short period of training he cannot possibly compete for work Kith the skilled agricultural labo\irer brought up amidst rural surroundings and having a life-long experience of the counti*yside0ITor is there any prospect of such a trainee securing a small holding0   County Councils already havo a..: long list of approved applicants possessing&quot;the necessary- -skill and capital for success, and it would be unfair to these applicants if trainees were given preferential treatment.Why should we deceive the unfortunate unemployed in this way?   It is not going to placate the Labour apposition for longj it is not even going to encottrage recruiting for long.    It is merely piling up tx^ouble for the future.   v.&quot;hat answer are we to give when the LaoourI [embers
9 9, r*v O *jjMembers ask how many trainees have seoured employment in home agriculture and why we deluded trainees with the prospect of employment in this country?This is not the way to meet the Labour opposition. The Labour opposition springs from ignoranoe of agriculture.    She only way to meet it is to state quito frankly that the problems of settlement  .In agriculture in the Dominions and in this country are fundamentally different; to remind them that this island is over-populated; that agriculture cannot absorb the unemployed labour from the to&quot;;ns; and that the only way to solve the problem Is to provide for settlement overseas, Khloh is the object of the Empire Settlement Act.fho proposal to arrange training with private farmers in this country to meet the Canadian demand, presents oonsiderahle difficulties.    It would be attacked by workers1 organisations as an attempt to secure cheap labour and to evade the Agricultural v.&apos;ages (Regulation) Act,   Any safeguards which might be devised would prove unreliable. Training should, in my opinion, be given at oentres specially established for the purpose-,r?  1*1 .* -* urostry of Agrioulture and Fisheries, 26th Maroh, 1928.
