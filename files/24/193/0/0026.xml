Section 1.[A 1610/154/45] No. 1.Foreign Ojjicc to Dominions Office.Sir, Foreign Office, March 7, 1928.WITH reference to the letter from this Office of the 17th ultimo, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit to you herewith two memoranda by the Secretary of State on the subject of (a) the Franco-American draft Pact of Perpetual Friendship, and (b) the draft arbitration treaty submitted by the United States Government to replace tho Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty of 1908.2. The Franco-American negotiations appear for the time being to be at a stand-still, and, up to the present moment, the official view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain has not been invited on the draft instrument which has formed the subject of these negotiations.3. The American draft of an arbitration treaty to replace the Root-Brycc treaty, clue to expire by limitation on the 4th June next, has, however, been officially coin-municated by the United States Government, and the text was enclosed in the letter from this office of the 11th January. It has been engaging the earnest consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, but, as stated in the last paragraph of the memorandum respecting the arbitration treaty, it may be difficult to reach any final opinion on the new draft until the report of the Geneva Security Commission, dealing inter alia with the form and tenor of reservations appropriate to arbitration treaties, has been received. The observations contained in the memorandum should therefore be regarded only as tentative and preliminary suggestions put forward by the Secretary of State for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The memorandum replaces the earlier document which was originally prepared for the information of the Cabinet and has been revised and brought up to date in order that it may be transmitted to the Governments of the Dominions. It will be seen that the points which appear to merit special attention are: (1) whether there should not be reserved to the British Parliaments a power similar to that of the Senate of the United States of America to appove cr disapprove the &quot; special agreement,&quot; which is a necessary preliminary to recourse to arbitration under the treaty. Experience shows that the &quot; reference&quot; has often a capital importance in international arbitrations ; (2) whether the new reservations suggested by the Government of the United States can be accepted in lieu of tho existing reservation of questions involving the &quot; vital interests, the independence or the honour&quot; of the contracting parties ; if so, (3) in what form a reservation should be made of any question involving the exercise of belligerent rights at sea, as to which there is at present a wide divergence between the British and continental schools of thought; and (4) whether the United States Government should be invited to offer a definition of the Monroe doctrine in order to determine precisely what questions will be excluded from tho operation of the treaty under article 3 (c) of the American draft.4. It would be of great value at the present moment if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain could similarly be furnished with any preliminary observations which His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions may desire to offer in the light of the considerations set forth in the accompanying memorandum, and I am therefore to suggest that, if the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs concurs in this opinion, an expression of their views should be invited at an early date.I am, &amp;c.LI.

CONFIDENTIAL. 15MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS.The Franco-American Draft Pact of Perpetual Friendship.IN April 1927 M. Briand, in a public message to the United States, declared the readiness of the French Government to sign with that country a treaty &quot; outlawing war.&quot; This rather vague declaration was, we are informed by the French Foreign office, received in America by both political parties with a degree of enthusiasm which had surprised M. Briand himself, in order to meet the earnest wish expressed in the first instance by the American press and public men, and secondly, by the United States Ambassador at Paris, who is stated to have been acting unofficially but under instructions. M. Briand drafted a short treaty of two articles whereby both countries agreed, according to M. Briand&apos;s phrase, to &apos;.&apos; outlaw war.&quot; The draft treaty, the text of which will be found as Appendix 1, was communicated to the United States last summer by the United States Ambassador at Paris.Under the draft treaty it was proposed that France and the United States should agree to &quot; condemn recourse to war and renounce it respectively as an instru-ment of their national policy towards each other.&quot; The settlement of disputes of whatever nature was &apos;* never to be sought by either side except by pacific means.&quot;While it is true that Mr. Borah and other influential personages in the United States, together with a certain section of the United States press, gave a warm welcome to the idea underlying the draft treaty, the reception accorded to it by the Administration was from the first exceedingly cool. Embarrassed by the support given to the proposal by a number of their adherents, yet unwilling to conclude a treaty which, so far as the United States is concerned, might give France a free hand to pursue in Europe policies appearing aggressive in American eyes, the United States Government did nothing at all in the matter until the end of December last. On the 28th of that month Mr. Kellogg suddenly addressed to the French Ambassador at Washington a note in which he stated that his Govern-ment were prepared to accept M. Briand&apos;s draft, provided that it was turned from a bilateral into a multilateral treaty to be signed by &apos;&apos; the principal Powers of the world &quot; and to be &quot; open to signature by all nations.&quot; It was suggested that the United States and French Governments should jointly submit such a treaty to &quot; the other nations of the world.&quot; It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the abrupt launching of this proposal, after the long delay of nine months since the Briand plan was first mooted, was not timed entirely without an eye on the presidential election which takes place next November. The State Department gave the widest possible publicity to the note almost before there had been time for it to reach the hands of the French Government.To Mr. Kellogg&quot;s note M. Briand replied accepting the idea that the treaty should be multilateral, but suggesting (a) that it should first be signed by France and the United States before being submitted to the other nations of the world, and (b) that the renunciation of war should apply to a war of aggression &quot; only. On the 11th January Mr. Kellogg handed to the French Ambassador in Washington a note in which he expressed satisfaction that M. Briand had agreed to make the treaty a multilateral one, but disagreed with his view that it should first be signed by the United States and France alone. The note went on to express surprise that M. Briand should now desire to limit the scope of the agreement to &quot;wars of aggression,&quot; as this was not the case with the original French draft. Mr. Kellogg now proposed that the treaty and the subsequent correspondence should be communi-cated to the Governments of Great Britain. Germany, Italy and France for their consideration and comment.The French Governments reply to this American note was despatched on the 21st January last in the form of a note from the French Ambassador in Washington to Mr. Kellogg.   This communication began by accepting the United4280   ; 17095]   [17277] ii
States proposal in the matter of procedure, namely, that the treaty should be sub-mitted in draft form by the United States and France to some of the principal Powers. The attention of the United States Government is then drawn to the duties imposed upon certain Powers by the League Covenant and by agree-ments such as those concluded at Locarno. Moreover, in the League resolution of September 1927, the action to be condemned as an international crime is a war of aggression. In face of the United States proposal to convert the draft bilateral pact into a multilateral one, the French Government had to bike into consideration the relations of the various Powers which would be Invited to take part in such a pact and for this reason had put forward the formula proposed in the French Ambassadors communication of the 5th January (i.e., limitation of the pact to wars of aggression only). The note ends by inviting suggestions from the United States Government as to the r. )ssibility cf reconciling the absolute condemnation of \v. r with the engagements and obligations assumed by the various nations.On the 27th February Mr. Kellogg communicated to the French Ambassador in Washington his reply to the latter*s note of the 21st January. After suggesting that the only substantial obstacle in the way of the unqualified acceptance by France of the proposals previously submitted by the United States Government is the doubt whether, as a member of the League of Nations and a party to the treaties of Locarno and other treaties guaranteeing &quot;neutrality, France can agree with the United States and other Powers not to resort to war without vpsb facto violating her present international obligations under those treaties. Mr. Kellogg endeavours to show that if the said obligations could be interpreted to permit France to conclude a treaty such as that originally proposed by M. Briand. it would not be unreasonable to suppose that this interpretation could be stretched to cover an equivalent multi-lateral treaty with other Powers. Mr. Kellogg goes on to express the earnest hepe that the French Government will be able to satisfy themselves that such a treaty would be consistent with League membership, and in this connexion he draws attention to the adoption of a resolution by the Pan-American Conference recently concluded at Havana by which twenty-one American States, of which seventeen are League members, expressed unqualified condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations. The note concludes with the statement that all war is an assault upon the stability of human society, and with a warm invitation to France to join the United States in communicating to the British. Italian. German and Japanese Governments the text of M. Briand&apos;s original proposal, together with copies of the subsequent correspondence, as a basis for preliminary discussions looking to the conclusion of an appropriate multilateral treaty prescribing recourse to war.&quot;I may add that Mr. Kellogg, in the course of the conveisations on the subject which he has had with our Ambassador at Washington, admitted that the draft treaty did not really conctitute an act that would &quot;outlaw war,&quot; but believed that it went as far as public opinion in the United States would allow at present. Mr. Kellogg did not understand why some French papers seemed to think that the proposal for a multilateral treaty would be a blow to the League of Nations. This was not at all his intention. His suggestion was really in the nature of a declaration against war, which, though abstract, would have great moral value upon public opinion generally. Mr. Kellogg insisted that he must bar any mention of an &quot; aggressive war,&quot; as no satisfactory definition of an &quot; aggressive nation &quot; had yet been found.The above is a brief outline of the history of these negotiations. For convenience of reference the texts of the French and United States notes appear as Appendix II.Turning to the text of the draft treaty, it will be seen that articles 1 and 2 only are of importance.Article 1.&quot; The high contracting Powers solemnly declare, in the name of the French people and the people of the United States of America, that they condemn recourse to war and renounce it respectively as an instrument of their national policy towards each other.&quot;Everything seems to depend on the precise meaning to be read into the phrase &quot; renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.&quot; There ought in theory to be no difference between the sense in which the French Government use the term
&quot; war of aggression &quot; and the sense in which the United States Government use the term &quot; recourse to war .... as an instrument of national policy.&quot; Tn practice, however, there is in the American mind a difference of interpretation, since the United States Government have categorically refused to accept the definition &quot; war of aggression.&quot;In attempting to narrow the scope of the treaty to &quot; wars of aggression,&quot; the French Government no doubt have in mind war in general after the elimination of the three exceptional cases specified in article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno. By that article Germany and France mutually undertook not to resort to war except (a.) In exercise of the right to legitimate defence.(6.) Acting in pursuance of article 16 of the Covenant.(c.) Acting in pursuance of a decision of the Assembly or Council of the League, or in pursuance of article 15, paragraph 7. of the Covenant, provided that, in this last event, the action is directed against the State which was the first to attack.The above exceptions appear to cover the cases in which a State has to go to war for reasons other than in pursuit of a deliberate policy of its own, i.i., they cover the cases in which hostilities would not constitute rendering war an &quot; instrument of the national policy.&apos;&apos;If this is. indeed, the French view, there is really not much difierence between the two parties, but hitherto it has passed the wit of man to define &quot; aggression.&quot; It would not be easy, even if France and the United States agreed that the ideas underlying their respective proposals were the same, to find a formula reconciling Franee*s need to cover her commitments under the Covenant with the United States need to exclude any recognition of the League as the body with whom will rest the ultimate decision whether a war is or is not &apos;* aggressive.&quot; To judge from the United States press comment, the United States has not the slightest intention of binding herself in advance to accept a League decision on such a point.The question has been raised how France can reconcile her original proposal for a Franco-American Pact with articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant, which oblige France as a member of the League of Nations to take belligerent measures against a non-member State (e.g.. the United States) because that State resorted to war with a member of the League. The view of the French Government on this point is under-stood to be that in the phrase &quot; renounce it [war] respectively as an instrument of their national policy towards each other&quot; the words in italics have the effect of limiting the operation of the treaty to war arising out of relations or disputes between the two parties to the treaty; in the French view, therefore, aiticle 1 of the proposed bilateral treaty does not run counter to any measiues, even of a warlike kind, which France may be obliged to take by reason of her commitments in the Covenant of the League.Article 2.&quot;The settlement or the solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between France and the United States of America, shall never be sought by either side except by pacific means.&quot;The settlement of a dispute is never to be sought except by pacific means. The draft Arbitration Treaty, to which I refer below, cites a number of cases which are to be excluded from the compulsory reference to arbitration. The question therefore arises: if such questions are not susceptible of settlement by arbitration and may yet not be subjected to the arbitrament of war, what machinery is to be set up for their elimination ? The French view on this point is understood to be that, if the conciliation proceedings provided for in article 1 of the Arbitration Treaty had failed to end the dispute, and if the subject-matter of the dispute was one which was excluded from arbitration under article 3 of that treaty, the dispute would, under the Pact of Perpetual Friendship, drag on unsettled. The position would be the same as under the Treaty of Locarno, where France and Germany reciprocally undertake not to resort to war, even though the League Council, acting under article 15 of the Covenant, may not succeed in framing recommendations which both parties are willing to accept. Want of unanimity in the Council in that case does not entitle France and Germany to go to war with each other, because that war is absolutely prohibited by the wording of the Locarno Treaty.[17277] b 2
The French Government have now asked for an expression of our views on the text of this treaty and on the exchange of notes, while the United States Government have also communicated the documents to the Foreign Office &quot; for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;&apos; As the Franco-American negotiations show some signs of breaking down, it seems desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should avoid, if possible, committing themselves at the present stage to any definite expres-sion of opinion. Moreover, it is not very clear what practical purpose the new treaty would serve, since no machinery is to be set up for dealing with questions which at present are held to be unsuitable for settlement by arbitration. The only arguments in its favour which occur to me are (1) that it may, as Mr. Kellogg suggested in a conversation with Sir Esme Howard, promote the formation of &quot;world opinion for peace,&quot; and (2) that it may tend to draw the United States away from the policy of complete isolation, and may bring about a better understanding there of European problems, such as the reparations and debt questions. This I am bound to admit is at present a faint hope, but a consideration of the United States proposal suggests an enquiry as to what course the United States Government would propose to take if, after they had insisted on making the treaty multilateral, one of the signatory Powers broke its obligations in respect of a third party. A rebuff to the United States Government at this stage may drive the Administration still further into the isolationist camp. On the other hand, there are dangers inherent in the very vagueness and uncertainty of the phrase &quot;renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.&quot;It will be well, therefore, to refrain at this stage from any definite expression of opinion in regard to this instrument.APPENDICES.List of Appendices.I.

APPENDIX II.Correspondence between, the French and United States Governments relative to the negotiation of a Pact of Perpetual Friendship.Department of State, Washington, Excellency, December 2S, 1927.I HAVE the honour to refer to the form of treaty entitled &quot; Draft of Pact of Perpetual Friendship between France and the United States &quot; which his Excellency, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was good enough to transmit to me informally last June through the instrumentality of the American Ambassador at Paris.This draft treaty proposes that the two Powers should solemnly declare in the name of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war, renounce it as an instrument of their national policy towards each other, and agree that a settlement of disputes arising between them, of whatsoever nature or origin they may be, shall never be sought by either party except through pacific means. I have given the most careful consideration to this proposal and take this occasion warmly to reciprocate on behalf of the American people the lofty sentiments of friendship which inspired the French people through his Excellency, M. Briaud, to suggest the proposed treaty.The Government of the United States welcomes every opportunity for joining with the other Governments of the world in condemning war and pledging anew its faith in arbitration. It is firmly of the opinion that every international endorsement of arbitration and eyerjT treaty repudiating the idea of a resort to arms for the settlement of justiciable disputes materially advances the cause of world peace. My views on this subject find a concrete expression in the form of the arbitration treaty which I have proposed in my note to you of the 28th December, 1927, to take the place of the Arbitration Convention of 190S. The proposed treaty extends the scope of that convention and records the unmistakable determination of the two Governments to prevent any breach in the friendly relations which have subsisted between them for so long a period.In view of the traditional friendship between France and the United States a friendship which happily is not dependent upon the existence of any formal engagement and in view of the common desire of the two nations never to resort to arms in the settlement of such controversies as may possibly arise between them, which is recorded in the draft arbitration treaty just referred to it has occurred to me that the two Governments, instead of contenting themselves with a bilateral declaration of the nature suggested by M. Briand, might make a more signal contribution to world peace by joiniug in an effort to obtain the adherence of all the principal Powers of the world to a declaration renouncing war as an instrument of national policy. Such a declaration, if executed by the principal world Powers, could not but be an impressive example to all the other nations of the world and might conceivably lead such nations to subscribe in their turn to the same instrument, thus perfecting among all the Powers of the world an arrangement heretofore suggested only as between France and the United States.The Government of the United States is prepared therefore to concert with the Government of Frauce with a view to the conclusion of a treaty among the principal Powers of the world, open to signature by all nations, condemning war and renouncingArticle 2.The settlement or the solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between France and the United States of America, shall never be sought by either side except by pacific means.Article 3.The- present Act shall be ratified, the ratifications thereof shall be exchanged at as soon as possible, and from that time it shall have full forceand value.Tu witness whereof the above-named Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Act and have thereunto set their seal.Done at Paris in two copies (each drawn up both in French and English and having equal force) the , 1927.
it as an instrument of national policy in favour of the pacific settlement of international disputes. If the Government of France is willing to join with the Government of the United States in this endeavour, and to enter with the United States and the other principal Powers of the world into an appropriate multilateral treaty, I shall be happy to engage at once in conversations looking to the preparation of a draft treaty following the lines suggested by M. Briand for submission by France and the United States jointly to the other nations of the world.Accept, &amp;c.FRANK B. KELLOGG.Repojisc d la Leltre du Secretaire dSEtat des Etats-Unis du 2S Decembre 1.927.Par sa lettre du 28 deoembre dernier, votre Excellence a bien voulu me faire connaitre le sentiment du Gouverncmeut des Etats-Unis sur le projet d&apos;acte propose par le Gouvernement de la Republique an mois de juin P)27 en vue de condanmer la guerre et de renoucer a la guerre comme instrument de la politique nationale reciproque de la France et des Etats-Unis.Selon votre Excellence, les deux Gouvernements, au lieu de se borner a un acte bilateral, contribueraient davantage a la paix du monde en joignant leurs efforts pour obtenir Fadhesion de toutes les principales Puissances du monde a une declaration de renoneiatiou a la guerre comnic instrument de leur politique nationale. Une telle declaration, si elle etait souscrite par les principales Puissances, ne saurait qu&apos;etre un exemple solenncl pour toutes les nations du monde et pourrait sans doute amener celles-ci a souscrire a leur tour a ce meme acte, achevant ainsi entre toutes les Puissances du monde un arrangement jusqu&apos;ici suggere seulement entre la France et les Etats-Unis.En consequence, le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis serait dispose a se concerter avec le Gouvernement de la Republique en vue de conclure entre les principales Puissances du monde un traite qui, ouvert a la signature de toutes les nations, coudamnerait la guerre, contiendrait la declaration d&apos;y renoncer comme instrument de la politique nationale et y substituerait le reglemeut pacifique des contestations entre les nations.Votre Excellence ajoutait que si le Gouvernement de la Republique acceptait de se joindre a cet egard au Gouvernement des Etats-Unis et de participer avec les Etats-Unis et les autres principales Puissances du monde a im .acte nrmltilateral approprie, votre Excellence serait heureuse d&apos;engager immediatement les conversations en vue de la preparation d&apos;un projet inspire des suggestions de M. Briand et destine a etre propose conjoiutement par la France et les Etats-Unis aux autres nations du monde.Le Gouvernemeut de. la Republique a hautemeut apprecie 1&apos;accueil favorable que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis a bien voulu faire a la proposition de M. Briand. II estime que la procedure suggeree par votre Excellence et suivie dans des termes correspondant a 1&apos;opinion publique et au sentiment populaire des diverses nations apparait bien comme de nature a satisfaire aux vues du Gouvernemeat francais. II y aurait avantage a en consacrer des a present le caractere par la signature de la France et des Etats-Unis.Je suis autorise a vous faire connaitre que le Gouvernement de la Republique est dispose a se joindre au Gouvernement des Etats-Unis pour proposer a 1&apos;agrement de toutes les nations un acte ainsi des a present signe par la France et les Etats-Unis, et aux termes duquel les lumtes parties contractantes s&apos;interdiraient toute guerre cVagression et declareraieut que, pour le reglement des conflits de q\ielque nature qu&apos;ils soient qui viendraient a s&apos;elever entre elles, elles emploieront tous les moyens paciliques. Les hautes parties contractantes s&apos;engageraient a porter cet acte a la connaissauce de tous les Etats et a les inviter a y acceder.Le Gouvernement de la Republiqite est convaincu qxie ces maximes aiusi proclamees ne sauraient etre accueillies qu&apos;avee gratitude par le monde eutier, et il ne douta pas que les efforts des deux Gouvernements pour en assurer Padoption universelle ne soient couronnes d&apos;un plein sxicces.(Washington, 5 Janvier 1928.)
Reply of the United States Secretary of State to the French Ambassador&apos;s note of January 5.Excellency, Washington, January 11, 1928.IN the reply which your Government was good enough to make to my note of the 28th December, 1927, his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs, summarised briefly the proposal presented by the Government of the United States and stated that it appeared to be of such a nature as to satisfy the views of the French Government. In the circumstances he added that the Government of the Republic was disposed to join with the Government id&apos; the United States in proposing for acceptance by all nations a treaty to be signed at the present time by France and the United States under the terms of which the high contracting parties should renounce all wars of aggression and should declare that they would employ all peaceful means for the settlement of any differences that might arise between them. The Government of the United States is deeply gratified that the Government of Fiance has seen its way clear to accept, in principle, its proposal that, instead of the bilateral pact originally suggested by M. Briand, there be negotiated among the principal Powers of the world an equivalent multilateral treaty open to signature by all nations. There can be no doubt that such a multilateral treaty would be a far more effective instrument for the promotion of pacific relations than a mere agreement between France and the United States alone, and, if the present efforts of the two Governments achieve ultimate success, they will have made a memorable contribution to the cause of world peace.While the Government of France and the Government of the United States are new closely in accord so far as the multilateral treaty is concerned, the language of M. Briand&apos;s note of the 5th January, 1928, is in two respects open to an interpre-tation not in harmony with the idea which the Government of the United States had in mind when it submitted to you the proposition outlined in my note of the 2Sth December, 1927. In the first place, it appears to be the thought of your Government that the proposed multilateral treaty be signed in the first instance by France and the United States alone, and then submitted to the other Powers for their acceptance. In the opinion cf the Government cf the United States this pro-cedure is open to the objection that a treaty, even though acceptable to France and the United States, might for some reason be unacceptable to one of the othev great Powers. In such event the treaty could net come into force, and the present efforts of France and the United States would be rendered abortive. This unhappy result would not necessarily fellow a disagreement as to terminology arising prior to the definitive approval by any Government of a proposed form of treaty, since it is by no means unreasonable to suppose that the views of the Governments concerned could be accommodated through informal preliminary discussions and a text devised which would be acceptable to them all. Both France and the United States are too deeply interested in the success of their endeavours for the advancement of peace to be willing to jeopardize the ultimate accomplishment of their purpose by incurring unnecessary risk of disagreement with the other Powers concerned, and I have no doubt that your Government will be entire!)&apos; agreeable to joining with the Government of the United States and the Governments of the other Powers concerned for the purpose of reaching a preliminary ariangement as to the language tc be used in the proposed treaty, thus obviating all danger of confrenting the other Powers with a definitive treaty unacceptable to them. As indicated below, the Government of the United States would be pleased if the Government of France would agree that the draft treaty submitted by M. Biiand last June should be made the basis of such preliminary discussions.In the second place and this point is closely related to whrt goes before  M. Briand&apos;s reply of the 5th January, 1923, in expressing the willingness of the Government of France to join with the Government of the. United States in proposing a multilateral treaty for the renunc:a^ion of war, apparently contemplates that the scope of such treaty should be limited to wars of aggression. The. form of treaty which your Government submitted to me last June, which was the subject of my note of the 28th December, 1927, contained no such qualifications. On the contrary, it provided unequivocally for the renunciation by the high contracting Powers of all war as an instrument of national policy in the following terms : &quot; Article 1.&quot; The high contracting Powers solemnly declare, in the name of the French people and the people of the United States of America, that they condemn recourse to war and renounce it respectively as an instrument of their national policy towards each other.
s&quot;Article 2.&quot; The settlement or the solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between France and the United States of America, shall&quot;never be sought by either side except by pacific means.&quot;I am not informed of the reasons which have led your Government to suggest this modification of its original proposal, but I earnestly hope that it is of no&quot; particular significance and that it is not to be taken as an indication that the Govern-ment of France will find itself unable to join with the Government of the United States in proposing, as suggested above, that the original formula submitted by M. Briand, which envisaged the unqualified renunciation of all war as an instrument of national policy, be made the subject of preliminary discussions with the other Great Powers for the purpose of reaching a tentative agreement as to the language to be used in the proposed treaty.If your Government is agreeable to the plan outlined above and is willing that the further discussions of the terms of the proposed multilateral treaty be basedupon the original proposal submitted by M. Briand last June, I have the honour to suggest that the Government of France join with the Government of the United States in a communication to the British, German, Italian and Japanese Governments, transmitting the text of M. Briahd&apos;s original proposal and copies of the subsequent correspondence between the Governments of France and the United States for their consideration and comment, it being understood, of course, that these preliminary discussions would in no way commit any of the participating Governments pending the conclusion of a definitive treaty.Accept. &amp;c.FRANK B. KELLOGG.Translation of,a Communication dated January 21, 192S. from the French Avibassador to the United States Secretary of State.Mr. Secretary of State.Your Excellency was pleased to inform me, in your note of the 11th instant, of the consideration suggested to you by my letter of the 5th January in answer to your communication of the 2Sth December, 1927. My Government has asked me to express to you its satisfaction at the harmonizing, thanks to your Excellency, of the views of the two Governments concerning the best method of accomplishing a project upon the essential principles of which they apparently are in agreement.The original French proposal of June 1927, contemplating an act confined to France and the United States, appeared to the French Government to be both desirable and feasible by reason of the historical relations between the two republics.The American Government was only willing, however, to embody the declaration proposed by the French Government in the preamble of the Franco-American Arbitration Convention now in process of renewal, and considered, on the other hand, for reasons of its own which the French Government has not failed to take into account, that there it would be opportune to broaden this manifestation against war, and to make of it the subject of a separate act in which the other Powers would be invited to participate.The Government of the Republic was not opposed to this expansion of its original plan, but it would not but realise, and it felt bound to point out that the new negotiation as proposed would be more complex and likely to meet with various difficulties.The question as to whether there would be any advantage in having such an instrument, of a multipartite nature, signed, in the first place, by France and the United States, or else first elaborated by certain of the principal Powers of the world, and then presented to all for their signature, is essentially one of procedure.The Government of the Republic refrained from offering suggestions upon this point solely because of its desire more speedily and more surely to achieve the result which it seeks in common with the United States. This is tantamount to saying that it is ready to concur in any method which may appear to be the most practicable.There is, however, a situation of fact to which my Government has requested me to draw your particular attention.iiiiwiiiiinimiiiiiiiiiiimiiimmiiiiiiiiiimimimiiii
The American Government cannot be unaware of the fact that the great majority of the Powers of the world, and among them most of the principal Powers, are making the organisation and strengthening of peace the object of common efforts carried on within the framework of the League of Nations. They are already bound to one another by a covenant placing them under reciprocal obligations, as well as by agreements such as those signed at Locarno in October 1925, or by international conventions relative to guarantees of neutrality, all of which engagements impose upon them duties which they cannot contravene.In particular, your Excellency knows that all States members of the League of Nations represented at Geneva in the month of September last, adopted, in a joint resolution tending to the condemnation of war, certain principles based on the respect for the reciprocal rights and duties of each. In that resolution the Powers were led to specify that the action to be condemned as an international crime is aggressive war, and that all peaceful means must be employed for the settlement of differences, of any nature whatsoever, which might arise between the several States.This is a condition of affairs which the United States, while a stranger thereto, cannot decline to take into consideration, just as must any other State called upon to take part in the negotiation.Furthermore, the United States would not in any way be bound thereby to the provisions of the covenant of the League of Nations. The French proposal of June last looking to the conclusion of a bi-lateral compact, had been drawn up in the light of the century-old relations between France and the United States; the French Government still stands ready to negotiate with the American Government on the same conditions and on the same basis. It has never altered its attitude in that respect. But when confronted by the initiative of the United States in proposing a multipartite covenant, it had to take into consideration the relations existing among the various Powers which would be called upon to participate therein. This it has done, with the object of assuring the success of the treaty contemplated by the United States. Its suggestions of the 5th January as to the terms of the multipartite treaty are inspired by the formula which has already gained the unanimous adherence of all of the States members of the League of Nations, and which for that very reason might lie accepted by them with regard to the United States, just as it has already been accepted among themselves.This is the explanation of our proposal of the 5th January.The Government of the Republic has always, under all circumstances, very clearly and without mental reservation declared its readiness to join in any declara-tion tending to denounce war as a crime and to set up international sanctions susceptible of preventing or repressing it. There has been no change in its sentiments in that respect; its position remains the same. Your Excellency may, therefore, be assured of its sincere desire to respond to the idea of the American Government, and to second its efforts to the full extent compatible with the situation of fact created by its international obligations. It is this preoccupation which inspired the formula proposed on the 5th January, a formula which does, indeed, seem to be the most apt at this time to assure the accomplishment of the American project. The Govern-ment of the Republic accordingly cannot but hope that the American Government will share this view. Subject to these observations, the Government of the Republic would, moreover, very gladly welcome any suggestions offered by the American Government which would make it possible to reconcile an absolute condemnation of war with the engagements and obligations assumed by the several nations and the legitimate concern for their respective security.Pray accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the assurances, &amp;c,PAUL CLAUDEL.Reply of the United States Secretary of State to the French Ambassador&apos;s note of January 21.Excellency, Washington, February 27, 192S.OUR recent discussions of the question whether the&apos; United States and France could join in suggesting to the other principal Powers of the world the conclusion of a treaty prescribing- war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations have been brought by your note of the 21st January, 192S, to a point where it seems necessary, if success &quot;is to be achieved, to examine the problem from a practical point of view.[17277] c
It is evident from our previous correspondence that the Governments of France and the United States are of one mind in their earnest desire to initiate and promote a new international movement for effective world peace, and that they are in agree-ment as to the essential principles of the proccduic to be followed in the accomplish-ment of their common purpose. As I understand your note of the 21st January, 1928. the only substantial obstacle in the way of the unqualified acceptance by France of the proposals which I submitted in my notes of the 2Sth December, 1927, and the 11th -January, 192S, is your Governments doubt whether, as a member of the League of Nations and party to the treaties of Locarno and other treaties guaranteeing neutrality, France can agree with the United Stales and the other principal world Powers not to resort to war in their mutual relations, without ipso facto violating her present international obligations under those treaties. In your Excellences last note, this question was suggested for consideration.Without, of course, undertaking formally to construe the present treaty obligations of France, I desire to point out that, if those obligations can be inter-preted sc as to permit France to conclude a treaty with the United States such as that offered to me last June by M. Briand and offered again in your note of the 21st January, 192S, it is not unreasonable to suppose that they can be interpreted with equal justice so as to permit France tc join with the United States in offering to conclude an equivalent multilateral treaty with the other principal Powers of the world. The difference between the bilateral and multilateral form of treaty, having for its object the unqualified renunciation of war asan instrument of national policy, seems to me to be one of degree and not of substance. A Government free to conclude such a bilateral treaty should be no less able to become a party to an identical multilateral treaty, since it is hardly to be presumed that members of the League of Nations are in a position to do separately something they cannot do together. I earnestly hope, therefore, that your Government, which admittedly perceives no bar to the conclusion of an unqualified anti-war treaty with the United States alone, will be able to satisfy itself that an equivalent treaty among the principal world Powers woidd be equally consistent with membership in the League of Nations. If, however, members of the League of Nations cannot, without violating the terms of the Covenant of the League, agree among themselves, and with the United States, to renounce war as an instrument of their national policy, it seems idle to discuss either bilateral or multilateral treaties unreservedly renouncing war. I am reluctant to believe, however, that the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations really stand in the way of the co-operation of the United States and members of the League of Nations in a common effort to abolish the institution of war. Of no little interest in this connexion is the recent adoption of a resolution by the Sixth International Conference of American States expressing, in the name of the American republics, unqualified condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations. It is significant to note that, of the twenty-one States represented at the conference, seventeen are members of the League of Nations.I trust, therefore, that neither France nor any other member of the League of Nations will finally decide that an unequivocal and unqualified renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy either violates the specific obligations imposed by the Covenant or conflicts with the fundamental idea and purpose of the League of Nations. On the contrary, is it not entirely reasonable to conclude that a. formal engagement of this character, entered into by all of the principal Powers, and ultimately, I trust, by the entire family of nations, would be a most effective instrument for promoting the great ideal of peace which the League itself has so closely at heart? If, however, such a declaration were accompanied by definitions of the word &quot;aggressor,&quot; and by exceptions and qualifications stipulating when nations would be justified in going to war, its effect would be very greatly weakened, and its positive value as a guarantee of peace virtually destroyed. The ideal which inspires the effort so sincerely and so hopefully put forward by your Government and mine is arresting and appealing just because of its purity and simplicity, and I cannot avoid the feeling that, if Governments should publicly acknowledge that they can only deal with this ideal in a technical spirit and must insist upon the adoption of reservations impairing, if not utterly destroying, the true significance of their common endeavours, they would be in effect only recording their impotence, to the keen disappointment of mankind in general.From the broad standpoint of humanity and civilisation all war is an assault upon the stability of human society and should be suppressed in the common interest. The Government of the United States desires to see the institution of war abolished, and stands ready to conclude with the French, British, Italian, German and
Japanese Governments a single multilateral treaty, open to subsequent adherence by any and all other Governments, binding the parties thereto not to resort to war with one another. The precise language to lie employed in such a treaty is a matter of indifference to the United States, so long as it clearly and unmistakably sets forth the determination of the parties to abolish war among themselves. I therefore renew the suggestion contained in my note of the 11 th January. 1928, that the Government of France join with the Government of the United States in transmitting to the British. Italian, German and Japanese Governments, for their consideration and comment,&apos; the text of M. Briand&apos;s original proposal, together with copies of the subsequent correspondence between France and the United States, as a basis for preliminary discussions looking to the conclusion of an appropriate multilateral treaty proscribing recourse to war.Accept &amp;c (Signed) *   &quot;   FRANK B. KELLOGG.
CONFIDENTIAL.- 15MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS.United States Draft of an Arbitration Treaty to replace the Anglo-AmericanArbitration Treaty of 1908.Mr. HOUGHTON, in the course of an interview with me on the 5th July last, drew attention to the fact that the Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty would expire next June, and enquired informally what was likely to be the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter. Would they be prepared to renew this treaty? I replied that I could say confidently, even without consulting my colleagues, that we should be most willing to renew the treaty. In the ensuing conversation he made it clear that he merely wished to know, for the information of his Secretary of State, whether the treaty could be renewed in its present form. We have therefore been proceeding on the assumption that the United States Govern-ment desired to renew the Root-Bryce Treaty in its existing form, and His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain have been in touch with the various Dominion Governments with a view to its renewal.This was the position when, on the 29th December last. Mr. Kellogg addressed to Sir E. Howard a note, in which he transmitted, for our consideration and as a basis for negotiation, the draft of a new Treaty of Arbitration to take the place of the treaty which expires next June (Appendix I). Mr. Kellogg stated that the language of his draft was&apos;7/ti/taiis mutandis identical with that of the draft treaty which he had transmitted on the previous day to the French Ambassador for the consideration of his Government.In order to permit a convenient comparison between the new United States text and the text of the Root-Bryce. Treaty of 1908. the two texts have been placed side by side: Draft Treaty of Arbitration submitted by the United States Government.Preamble.The President of the United States of America and His Majesty the King of Great Britain. Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, determined to prevent so far as in their power lies any interruption in the peaceful relations that have happily existed between the two nations for more than a century, desirous of re-affirming their adherence to the policy of submit-ting to impartial decision all justiciable controversies that may arise between them, and eager by their example not only to demonstrate their condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations, but also to hasten the time when the perfection of inter-national arrangements for the specific settlement of international disputes shall have eliminated for ever the possibility of war among any of the Powers of the world, have decided to conclude a new treaty of arbitration enlarging the scope and obligations of the arbitration convention signed at Washington on the 4280a   [17095]   [17277a]Arbitration Convention of 1908 between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and the Presi-dent of the United States of America, desiring in pursuance of the principles set forth in articles 15-19 of the Conven-tion for the Pacific Settlement of Inter-national Disputes, signed at The Hague, the 29th July, 1899, to enter into negotia-tions for the conclusion of an arbitration convention, have named as their Plenipotentiaire-tentiaries, to wit :His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India: the Right Honourable James Bryce, O.M., andThe President of the United States of America : Elihu Root, Secretary of State of the United States;Who, after having communicated to one another their full powers, found ins
4th April, 1908, which expires by limita-   good and due form, have agreed upon the tion on the 4th June, 1928. and for that   following articles:-purpose they have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries :The President of the United States of America :His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas. Emperor of India :who, having communicated to one another their full powers found in good and clue form, have agreed upon the following articles :Preamble. There is nothing in the preamble to which serious objection need be taken. It may perhaps appear a rather sweeping declaration that Great Britain and the United States should state that they are desirous of reaffirming their adherence to the policy of submitting1 to impartial decision all justiciable controversies,&quot; but there can be no great objection to such a statement appearing in a preamble.The wording^would, however, ret]uire modification to provide for the event of signature, by the Dominions and India under separate full powers in the form reconi-mended by the Imperial Conference, of 1926. The words &quot; between the two nations &quot; in line 8 of the preamble should perhaps be altered so as to read &quot; between their respective countries.&apos;&quot; The words &quot; to one another &quot; at the end of the preamble are superfluous.Article 1.Any disputes arising between the high contracting parties, of whatever nature they may be, shall, when ordinary diplo-matic proceedings have failed and the high contracting parties do not have recourse to adjudication by a competent tribunal, be submitted for investigation and report, as prescribed in the treaty signed at Washington, the 15th Septem-ber, 1914, to the Permanent International Commission constituted pursuant thereto.Article 1. There was no corresponding article in the Root-Bryce Treaty. The article does not appear to have any effect other than that of linking up the new draft treaty with the treaty concluded in 1914 for the establishment of a Peace Commission, commonly known as the Bryan Peace Treaty (see Appendix III). This treaty provides that all disputes between the contracting parties of any nature whatsoever (other than those, the settlement of which is already provided for in existing agreements) shall, when diplomatic methods of adjustment have failed, be referred for investigation and report to a permanent international commission. Hostilities are not to be commenced during such investigation. The commission is composed of five members, one member to be chosen from each country by the Govera-inent of that country; one member to be chosen by each Government from some third country; the fifth member to be chosen by common agreement between the two Governments. Since its signature in 1914 no dispute has been referred to this Peace Commission.Under the new United States draft a reference to the Bryan&apos; Treaty is definitely to be regarded as the first step to be taken by the contracting parties whenever they have failed to reach agreement through the diplomatic channel or whenever there has been no prior agreement to refer the dispute to some other tribunal. This article, if it serves to bring the principle of conciliation into greater prominence, is all to the good.
Article 2.Article 1.All differences relating to international matters in which the high contracting parties are concerned by virtue of a claim of right made by one against the other, under treaty or otherwise, which it has not been possible to adjust by diplomacy, which have not been adjusted as a result of reference to the above-mentioned Per-manent International Commission, and which are justiciable in their nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of the principles of law or equity, shall be submitted to the Perma-nent Court of Arbitration established at The Hague by the convention of the 18th October. 1907. or to some other competent tribunal, as shall be decided in each case by special agreement, which special agree-ment shall provide for the organisation of such tribunal, if necessary, define its powers, state the question or questions at issue, and settle the terms of reference.Differences which may arise of a legal nature or relating to the interpretation of treaties existing between the two contract-ing parties and which it may not have been possible to settle by diplomacy, shall be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration established at The Hague by the convention of the 29th July, 1899, provided, nevertheless, that they do not affect the vital interests, the indepen-dence, or the honour of the two contract-ing States, and do not concern the interests of third parties.Article 2.In each individual case the high con-tracting parties, before appealing to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, shall conclude a special agreement defining clearly the matter in dispute, the scope of the powers of the arbitrators, and the periods to be fixed for the formation of the arbitral tribunal and the several stages of the procedure.A rticle 2. paragraph 1. of the new draft takes the place of article 1 and the first sentence of article 2 of the 1908 treaty.The drafting of this paragraph is defective by reason of the presence of a double attempt to define the word &quot;justiciable.&quot; If the dispute relates to a matter in which one party is concerned by virtue of a claim of right against the other, the dispute must necessarily be justiciable. Furthermore, if a justiciable case is in question, it is confusing to define it as &quot;susceptible of decision by the application of a rule of ... . equity.&quot; &quot;Equity&quot; is an elusive term, and, in international relations it means something more than strict law. The word &quot;equity&apos;&apos; should preferably be omitted.Continuation of Article 2.The special agreement in each case shall be made on the part of the United States of America by the President of the United Statesof America, byand with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the part of the British Empire in accord-ance with the constitutional laws of the British Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment reserving the right before conclud-ing a special agreement in any matter affecting the interests of a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire to obtain the concurrence therein of the Govern-ment of that Dominion.Continuation of Article 2.It is understood that such special agree-ments on the part of the United States will be made by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof; His Majesty&apos;s Government reserving the right before concluding a special agreement in any matter affecting the interests of a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire to obtain the concurrence therein of the Government of that Dominion.Such agreements shall be binding only when confirmed by the two Governments by an exchange of notes.Article 2. paragraph 2. This paragraph takes the place of the remainder of article 2 of the 1908 treaty. As in the case of the earlier treaty we are faced with the difficulty that the special agreement, the conclusion of which is a necessary preliminary to tlie reference of any dispute to arbitration, remains subject to ratification by the Senate. This body, therefore, has the power, by refusing to sanction the conclusion of the special agreement, to prevent arbitration upon a matter which admittedly falls within the terms of the draft treaty. In this respect the treaty (like its predecessors) is one-sided, because the Senate exercises constitutionally on the treaty-making powers of the Executive a restrictive influence, which, differing in degree from that exercised by the Legislature under British [17277a] b 2
parliamentary institutions, is in practice used remorselessly and with little regard for the wishes of the Administration of the day. This is a difficulty inherent in any treaty with the United States.At first sight, the following formula, in which the new wording is in italics, would seem preferable to the present Tinted States draft of article 2, paragraph 2 : &quot; The special agreement in each case shall be made on the part of the United States of America by the President of the United States of America, by aud with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the -part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions by His Majesty the King in accordance with constitutional practice.&apos;&apos;&apos;The expression &quot; His Majesty &quot;s dominions.&quot;&quot; used in this sense means the whole of the British Empire, and not the self-governing Dominions.The words &quot; in accordance with constitutional practice &quot; would, 1 am advised, cover the case where the Government of the day (either in Great Britain or the Dominions) considered the subject matter of any &quot; special agreement&quot;&apos; to be of such vital importance that they desired to submit the instrument, before ratification, to the British Parliament or Parliaments concerned. In such a case Parliament would have the same opportunity as the United States Senate to reject the agreement if it thought lit. The proposed wording should enable us to meet a possible objection raised by the United States Government that other important treaties have net been submitted to Parliament with the answer that His Majesty&apos;s govern-inent or Governments concerned must be the judges of what is or is not of sufficient importance to merit submission to Parliament, and that the advice they tender to the Crown is based upon such a consideration.In a draft treaty which had been prepared originally with a view to the renewal of the 1908 Arbitration treaty with the United States the last part of article 2. from the words &quot; His Majesty&quot;s Government reserving,&quot;&apos; were deleted and replaced by the words : ** All special agreements concluded in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be binding until they have been confirmed by an exchange of notes.&quot;Article 3.The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject matter of which (a.) Is within the domestic jurisdic-tion of either of the high contracting parties.(6.) Involves the interests of third parties.(c.) Depends upon or involves the maintenance of the traditional attitude of the United States con-corning American questions, commonly described as the Monroe doctrine.Article 1 of the draft treaty admits of no exception from the category of disputes to be submitted, after the failure of diplomatic methods of settlement, to the concilia-tion proceedings laid down in the Bryan-Spring-Rice Treaty of 1914. Article 3 of the draft treaty declares, on the other hand, that its provisions shall not be invoked in respect of certain classes of dispute. The two stipulations are clearly in conflict. The intention probably is that article 3 should apply to arbitration&apos; proceedings only, and this is confirmed by recent press messages from Washington respecting the recently concluded Franco-American Treaty. However, in order to remove any element of doubt, it is proposed that the first sentence of article 3 should be amended so as to read : &quot; The provisions of article 2 of this treaty shall not be invoked,&quot; &amp;c, thus removing any possible restriction on the operation of article 1 of the draft treaty.This article contains the revised formula for the reservations, to be substituted for the old phrase about vital interests, honour, &amp;c, in article 1 of the old treaty.The first heading relates to questions within the domestic jurisdiction of either party.
At the forthcoming meeting of the Security Commission at Geneva the general question of the reservations to be made in arbitration treaties will come up for discussion. If as a result of these discussions it is agreed that some reservation as to matters exclusively within the jurisdiction of one of the parties should be formulated, its text should be studied in detail by a competent committee of lawyers. &quot;Domestic jurisdiction &quot; is not altogether satisfactory as a phrase to express the underlying idea. By international law the principle is admitted that every sovereign State is supreme over certain questions; that is to say that, except in so far as it may voluntarily limit its freedom of action by treaty, it may act as it thinks best in these matters. Within this field no foreign State lias a right to complain of any action which may affect one of its nationals. But the extent of this field is vague and indefinite, and I should feel less uneasiness about using the phrase as a reservation in an arbitration treaty if agreement were a little more general as to what it covered.it may be mentioned as an example that the United States Government have always held that matters relating to immigration are exclusively of American concern, and there can be no doubt that, under this reservation, they expect to remove from the field of arbitration any dispute with Japan in regard to the immigration question a matter which has in the past led to much ill-feeling between the two countries.The second reservation excludes disputes which involve the interests of third parties. It is at this point that some form of words might be added so as to exclude from arbitration any question affecting our belligerent rights at sea. Quite possibly one of the objects of the United Stafes Government is to bring this question within the scope of the treaty ; they would claim that the question is justiciable because there is a body of international law which is supposed to govern the exercise of such rights, and they might further maintain that it cannot be held to be excluded under article 3, paragraph (b), because it is clearly not an &quot; interest&apos;&quot; of a third party to be blockaded. In the present political situation it would be advisable to find some better means than an explicit reservation of such rights, because the latter course would immediately raise a storm in the United States and be used by the Big Navy party as a useful weapon in their campaign for naval expansion. Perhaps the difficulty could be overcome by some elaboration of paragraph (b) which, while not specifically referring to the question of belligerent rights, would nevertheless be sufficiently comprehensive to prevent its compulsory reference to an arbitral tribunal. Whether, however, it is done implicitly or explicitly. I think there, can be no doubt that any dispute which might prevent the exercise of naval pressure by the British fleet in time of war must be. excluded from the operation of the new treaty.The third reservation is that of the Monroe doctrine. I confess I do not under-stand how this reservation is intended to work in practice. The Monroe doctrine is a policy of the United States relating to American countries other than the United States itself. It constitutes a notification to all the world that certain interferences on the part of European States with the republics of the Western Hemisphere, will be regarded by the United States as a casus belli. If, therefore, a dispute between this country and the United States involves the application of the Monroe doctrine, it will be because, some action taken by this country towards a Latin-American republic will be regarded by the United States as such an interference with that republic as to necessitate objection, and, in the last resort, belligerent action by the United States. The United States would not base such intervention on a claim of V right&quot; ; it is merely a policy; consequently the intervention would not constitute a justiciable dispute within the meaning of the treaty, Le., would not constitute a dispute in which the parties to the treaty would be in conflict as to their respective rights. The United States have no &quot; right&quot; in the technical sense of that term to intervene; such a right must be. based on law or treaty.If a claim by the United States to intervene is to be elevated into a right, the Monroe doctrine must itself be elevated into something of the nature of a law or a treaty. For that purpose it must be defined. Hitherto it has been of the essence of the Monroe doctrine, that, being an American policy, it was for the United States to interpret the doctrine and apply it as they pleased. In fact, the Monroe doctrine has grown with the growing strength of the United States and is to-day in the American popular mind a different thing from the doctrine originally proclaimed a century ago.It seems, on the whole, probable that the United States Government, were they asked to define what is the precise intention of paragraph (c) of article 3, would reply, if they were frank, that what they desire to avoid is to arbitrate any dispute which might ultimately call into question the validity of the Monroe doctrine, as
expounded by President Monroe, and as further interpreted since that time by various American statesmen. L attach in Appendix IV an extract from President Monroe&apos;s Message of December 1823, together with quotations from authoritative American pronouncements in regard to the doctrine-There are objections to inviting the United States Government to define more precisely the intention of this reservation, chief amongst which is the possibility that it might lead to a dispute between the 1 wo countries if some new and wider claim were now to be put forward in response to our invitation, if enquiry is held, to be necessary on this point, it could best be made by inviting confirmation by the United States Government, for the sake of clarity and to avoid future misunderstanding, that the doctrine is correctly defined by the various declarations quoted in Appendix IV.It may here be mentioned that all the Powers, including His Majesty, accepted in 1907 a reservation made in almost identical terms by the United Stales when they signed and ratified the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Inter-national Disputes of that year. A reservation of the Monroe doctrine appears also in article 21 of the League Covenant. Apart, therefore, from the undesirability of becoming involved in a discussion with the United States as to what the doctrine means, the hands of the Powers are tied by their own action in 1907.Article 4.The present treaty shall be ratified by the President of the United States of America by and with the advice and con-sent of the Senate thereof and by His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ire-land and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, in accord-ance with the constitutional laws of the British Empire: The ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington as soon as possible, and the treaty shall take effect on the date of the exchange of the ratifica-tions. It shall thereafter remain in force continuously unless and until terminated bv one year&apos;s written notice given by either high contracting party to the other.In faith whereof the respective pleni-potentiaries have signed this treaty in duplicate and hereunto affix their seals.Done at Washington the day of, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-Article 3.The present convention shall be ratified by His Britannic Majesty, and by the President of the United States of America by and with the advice and con-sent of the Senate thereof. The ratifica-tions shall be exchanged at Washington as soon as possible, and the convention shall take effect on the date of the exchange of its ratifications.Article 4.The present convention is concluded for a period of five years, dating from the day of the exchange of its ratifications.Done in duplicate at the City of Wash-ington, this fourth day of April, in the year 1908.(Signed)   James Bryce. (Signed)   Elihu Root.Article 4 of the new draft corresponds to articles 3 and 4 of the Root-Bryce Treaty. The new draft provides that the treaty shall remain in force continuously unless and until terminated by one years written notice, given by either high contracting party to the other. The old treaty was concluded for a period of five years only, but has hitherto been renewed without modification at the end of each five-yearly period. It would appear preferable to substitute !i in accordance with constitutional practice&quot; for &quot;in accordance with the constitutional laws of the British Empire.&quot;Franco-A merican Treaty.On the 6th February last a Franco-American Arbitration Treaty was signed at Washington to take the place of the Root Treaty with France which expired on the 27th February last. The terms of the new treaty (printed in Appendix II) are practically identical with those of the draft Arbitration Treaty submitted to us, the only change of consequence being the addition to article 3 of a fourth reservation which removes from the scope of arbitration under the treaty any dispute the subject-

Excellency, December 29, 1927.I HAVE the honour to refer to our conversation of this morning and to transmit herewith, for the consideration of your Government and as a basis for negotiation, a draft of a proposed Treaty of Arbitration. The provisions of this draft operate to extend the policy of arbitration enunciated in the convention signed at Washington, the 4th April, 1908 (which expires by limitation on the 4th June, 1928), and explicitly record the desire of the two Governments to condemn war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations. The language of the draft is mutatis mutandis identical with that of the draft treaty which I yesterday trans-matter of which &quot;depends upon or involves the observance of the obligations of France in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;At first sight France&apos;s engagements under the Covenant of the League of Nations would appear to be covered by the reservation in article 3, paragraph (b), which excludes from arbitration, questions involving the interests of third parties. But the French have wished to make assurance doubly sure on this point and it will probably.be wise that a similar reservation should be added to our Draft Treaty.General Obserrations.From the British point of view the worst feature of the Draft Arbitration Treaty is that we may find ourselves obliged to submit to arbitration, under its present terms, a question involving the future exercise of our belligerent rights at sea; subject to an amendment being introduced which would exclude this possibility, and subject to the other amendments discussed above, which are mainly designed to prevent possible divergencies of interpretation, the draft treaty does not appear to be open to serious objection. It is, however, impossible to say with certainty that, even if its terms are amended so as to exclude disputes affecting the exercise of belligerent rights, some, question of vital importance to this country may not arise which we should lie reluctantly compelled to arbitrate. If we are to have complete certainty on this point, it would be necessary once again to make some reservation designed to cover questions involving cur vital interests. An explicit reservation of vital interests would, however, defeat one of the main purposes of the new draft (which has even been emphasised by the French), that is. the elimination of the clause relating to the vital interests, the independence or the honour of the contracting parties. We should, moreover, by reverting simply to the old text, lay ourselves Open to the criticism that we had made no advance during the last twenty years.No final opinion can be expressed on the draft treaty until we are in possession of the report of the Geneva Security Commission, which is conducting an enquiry into the reservations appropriate to treaties of arbitration. This report may be expected in the course of March.At the time of signature of the Arbitration Convention of 1908 an exchange of notes took place with the United States Government, the terms of which are. set forth in Appendix V.It would seem desirable to renew these notes subject to such modifications as are rendered necessary by the altered form of the treaty and by developments which have occurred since 1908.A foreign Office, March 3, 1928.
mitted to the French Ambassador for the consideration of his Government, except for the reservation at the end of article 11 covering questions involving the interests of a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire. This clause was taken from article 1 of the Knox Treaty, concluded in 1911, but never coming into force.I feel that by adopting a treaty such as that suggested herein, we shall not only promote the friendly relations between the peoples of our two countries, but also advance materially the cause of arbitration and the pacific settlement of inter-national disputes. If your Government concurs in my views and is prepared to negotiate a treaty along the lines of that transmitted herewith, I shall be glad to enter at once upon such discussions as may be necessary.Accept, &amp;c.FRANK R.

APPENDIX III.Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America with regard to the Establishment of a Peace Commission. (Signed at Washington, September 15, 1914.)[Ratifications exchanged at Washington. November 10, 1914.]HIS Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas. Emperor of India, and the President of the United States of America, being desirous to strengthen the bonds of amity that bind them together and also to advance the cause of general peace, have resolved to enter into a treaty for that purpose, and to that end have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: His Britannic Majesty : The Right Honourable Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice, G.C.V.O.. K.C.M.G.. tvcllis Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Wash i ngton; a ndThe President of the United States : The Honourable William Jennings Bryan. Secretary of State of the United States;Who. after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, found to be in proper form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles : Article 1.The high contracting parties agree that all disputes between them, of every nature whatsoever, other than disputes the settlement of which is provided for and, in fact, achieved under existing agreements between the high contracting parties, shall, when diplomatic methods of adjustment have failed, be referred for investiga-tion and report to a Permanent International Commission, to be constituted in the manner prescribed in the next succeeding article; and they agree not to declare war or begin hostilities during such investigation and before the report is submitted.Article 2.The International Commission shall be composed of five members, to be appointed as follows : One member shall be chosen from each country by the Government thereof; one member shall be chosen by each Government from some third country; the fifth member shall be chosen by common agreement between the two Governments, it being understood that he shall not be a citizen of either country.The expenses of the commission shall be paid by the two Governments in equal proportions.The International Commission shall be appointed within six months after the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, and vacancies shall be filled according to the manner of the original appointment.Article 3.In case the high contracting parties shall have failed to adjust a dispute by diplomatic methods, they shall at once refer it to the International Commission for investigation and report. The International Commission may, however, spontaneously, by unanimous agreement, offer its services to that effect, and in such case it shall notify both Governments and request their co-operation in the investigation.In the event of its appearing to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the British interests affected by the dispute to be investigated are not mainly those of the United Kingdom, but are mainly those of some one or more of the self-governing Dominions, namely, the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Newfoundland, His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be at liberty to substitute as the member chosen by them to serve on the International Commission for such investigation and report another person selected from a list of persons to be named, one for each of the self-governing Dominions, but only one shall act namely, that one who represents the Dominion immediately interested.[17277a] n
appendix iv.Extract from Message of President Monroe, dated December 2, 1823.IT was stated at the commencement of the last Session that a great effort was then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries, and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation. It need scarcely be remarked that the result has been, so far, very different from what was then anticipated. Of events in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin we have always been anxious and interested spectators. The citizens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendly in favour of the liberty and happiness of their fellow-men on that side of the Atlantic. In the wars of the European Powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defence. With the movements in this hemisphere we are, of necessity, more immediately connected, and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political system of the Allied Powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective Governments. And to the defence of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore, to candour and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those Powers, to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.   With the existing colonies or dependencies ofThe high contracting parties agree to furnish the Permanent International Commission with all the means and facilities required for its investigation and report.The report of the International Commission shall be completed within one year after the date on which it shall declare its investigation to have begun, unless the high contracting parties shall limit or extend the time by mutual agreement. The report shall be &quot;prepared in triplicate; one copy shall be presented to each Govern-ment and the third retained by the commission for its files.The high contracting parties reserve the right to act independently on the subject-matter of the dispute after the report of the commission shall have been submitted.Article 4.This treaty shall not affect in any way the provisions of the treaty of the 11th January. 1909. relating to questions arising between the United States and the Dominion of Canada.article 5.The present treaty shall be ratified by His Britannic Majesty and by the President of the United States of America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington as soon as possible. It shall take effect immediately after the exchange of ratifications, and shall continue in force for a period of five years, and it shall thereafter remain in force until twelve months after one of the high contracting parties have given notice to the other of an intention to terminate it.In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the present treaty and have affixed thereunto their seals.Done in duplicate at Washington on the fifteenth day of September, in the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and fourteen.(L.S.)

Pronouncements! by American Statesmen with regard to the Monroe Doctrine.Mr. Hay in 1903 said in connection with the naval blockade of Venezuela by Great Britain, Germany and Italy, that &quot; the United States could not object to foreign Powers taking steps against American countries to obtain redress for injuries suffered by their subjects, provided that no acquisition of territory was contemplated.&quot;In 191-1 Mr. J. W. Foster (ex-Secretary of State) said : &quot;The primary object of the doctrine was, and is, to prevent the permanent occupation by European nations of any of the territory of the American States or the overthrow of their political institutions. Succeeding Administrations have repeatedly stated that European Governments are free to make war on the American States or to resort to force to support their complaints, provided that they observe the two conditions above stated as to territory and political institutions.&quot;Mr. Root said in 1914: &quot; As the Monroe doctrine neither asserts nor involves any right of control by the United States over any American nation, it imposes upon the United States no duty towards European Powers to exercise such a control.&quot;Mr. Hughes in 1923 declared that the Monroe doctrine was &quot;opposed (1) to any non-American action encroaching upon the political independence of American States under any guise, and (2) to the acquisition in any manner of the control of additional territory in this hemisphere by any non-American Power.&quot;any European Power we have not interfered, and shall not interfere. But with, the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it. and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European Power, in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the United States. In the war between those new Governments and Spain, we declared can- neutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this we have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur, which, in the judgment of the competent authorities of this Government, shall make a corresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to their security.The late events in Spain and Portugal show- that europe is still unsettled. Of this important fact, no stronger proof can be adduced than that the Allied Powers should have thought it proper, on any principles satisfactory to themselves, to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of Spain. To what extent such inter-position may be carried on the same principle is a question in which all independent Powers, whose Governments differ from theirs, are interested; even those most remote, and surely none more so than the United States. Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains the same, which is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its Powers; to consider the Government de facto as the legitimate Government for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations by a frank, firm and manly policy, meeting, in all instances, the just claims of every Power, submitting to injuries from none. But in regard to these continents, circumstances are eminentlv and conspicuously different. It is impossible that the Allied Powers should extend their political system to any portion of either Continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold such inter-position in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Governments and their distance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue them. . It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves, in the hope that other Powers will pursue the same course.
