POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT IN REGARD TO THE IMPERIAL WIRELESS CONFERENCE.

Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.

I understand that the Cabinet is to consider to-morrow the proposals of the Eastern Telegraph and Marconi Companies for a merger, as a condition of which they have asked for the transfer of the Post Office Beam service. The proposal has some very attractive features. It would create a single Empire-wide organisation capable of holding its own effectively against American competition. It would enable great savings in working costs to be made by handing over all the cable receiving offices to the Post Office; and the unification of all the channels of oversea communication by cable, wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony would make for rapidity of transmission. The future value of the beam is, of course, still unknown, and any scheme whether of transfer or lease, would have to be so framed as to ensure to the British Government its share in the profits arising from future developments. Obviously too, so powerful a monopoly would require a more effective measure of control by the Governments of the Empire than the mere Advisory Council suggested by the companies.

My object, however, is not to discuss the scheme, in detail on its merits, beyond expressing the view that it does appear to me to deserve most serious consideration, but to urge that, whatever decision we come to, it should not be announced in the
99 9the House of Commons v/ithovt regard to the fact that the whole question is boing considered by an Imperial Conforcnco.    It would be ontiroly inconsistent with tho whole spirit In which Imporial Conferences are conducted if individual Governments mad... before, or during, tho progress of a Conforonco public announcements which prejudged tho conclusions of the Conference.   Whatever decision we come to on the merits of the question to-morrow I submit that it is a decision which should bo coiumunicatod to the Conference, but not communicated to tho Houso of CojiDY-ons until tho Conforonco has considered It, and has, as a Conforonco, come to a conclusion which can bo made public.   Any question In the House of Commons should bo answered, (as I understand similar questions are being answered in the Canadian Houso of Commons,) by refusing to make a statement in advance of a ropox^t by the Imperial Conference.   Any other course is bound to give serious offence, and to create the impression that we treat an Imperial Conference as if it wero of no consequence.I know it is suggostod that a more definite announcement is required to put an end to speculation in cable and wireless shares.   But tho papers have already made it clear that the merger Is purely contingent upon an agreement with tho Govornmonts concerned, and, a &quot;bear&quot; announcement now Is not going to have a bettor effect than a similar announcement mado a little later on tho report of tho Conforenoo, and may, Indeed, only add to the fluctuations If, in tho meantime, some solution Is still found by tho Conference which will onablo the merger to tako place.L.S .A.Dominions Office, Downing Street.20th March, 1928.
