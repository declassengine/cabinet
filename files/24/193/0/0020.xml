SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 70 (28).AKHWAN RAIDS.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary ofState for Air.A LARGE number of telegrams regarding the recent Akhwan raids have been circulated, and it may therefore be convenient for the Cabinet to have a short account of the situation.In the first place, whatever pretext may be alleged on any specific occasion, the underlying cause of these inter-tribal raids, the history of which stretches back for centuries, is largely economic, the tribes being, in fact, like certain tribes on the North-West Frontier of India, unable to obtain a living within the confines of their country. The immediate course of events prior to the present trouble has been as follows :  During the latter part of last year Ibn Saud wrote to the High Commissioner for Iraq protesting against the establishment by the Iraq Government of a police post at a place called Busaiyah, some 50 miles within the Iraq frontier. He repre-sented that this action on the part of the Iraq Government was contrary to the provisions of one of the Protocols to the Muhammarah Treaty of 1921, in virtue of which the Iraq and Nejd Governments mutually agreed &apos;* not to use the watering places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity.&quot;There was, of course, no foundation for the charge, and this was pointed out to Ibn Saud. In November, while the correspondence was proceeding, a party of Mutair (one of the most turbulent and fanatical tribes of Nejd) raided the police post and slaughtered its small garrison. Following upon this raid there were a number of further raids by Mutair tribesmen upon Iraq tribes. Strongly worded protests were sent to Ibn Saud, but these produced equivocal replies admitting that in carrying out the raids the leader of the Mutair, Sheikh Faisal-al-Dawish, had acted in direct defiance of his instructions, but suggesting that the fault really lay with the Iraq Government in constructing the police post, and adding that if the police post were abandoned the raids would cease. Further raids ensued and, finally, a message was received from Ibn Saud to say that the Mutair had definitely thrown off his authority and were no longer under his control.In the meantime these constant Akhwan raids had had the effect of seriously unsettling the Iraq tribe of Anizeh, one of the most powerful tribal confederations in Iraq, upon whose loyalty largely depends the security of the trans-desert route. Towards the end of December the High Commissioner reported that, unless effective measures were taken to prevent further raids and to restore the confidence of this tribe, there was a danger that they would desert Iraq and join the Akhwan. He explained that, owing to the immense stretch of frontier and the great distances involved, it was almost impossible for our aircraft to catch the raiders red-handed and to inflict punishment upon them within Iraq territory, and he asked for authority to take air action beyond the Iraq frontier in order to deny an area of grazing grounds to the Akhwan. The desired permission was given and Ibn Saud was notified accordingly. Advance aircraft and armoured car bases were formed early in January (not in Nejd territory), and notices were dropped warning tribes to move out of the area which was to be denied to the Akhwan. This action, coupled with constant air reconnaissances, had the effect of restoring the confidence of the Iraqi tribes. For some three weeks the raiding activity on the part of the Mutair was suspended. At the end of January, however, a small party of Akhwan raided further south into the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit. They were attacked by the forces of the sheikh and were subsequently attacked by British aircraft. The raid was repeated on a much more serious scale on the 19th February, when some 2,000 Akhwan tribesmen attacked Iraq and Koweit tribes at a spot near the Iraq-Koweit[17316]
frontier, situated some 65 miles from the nearest point on the Nejd frontier. The raiders were attacked on three separate occasions by British aircraft and are understood to have suffered severe losses.Our&apos;decision to undertake defensive air operations in Nejd territory produced a protest from Ibn Saud, who represented that he had already set in motion measures to re-establish control over the Mutair when the public feeling aroused in Nejd by our air action forced him to abandon these measures. In reply to this protest a message was sent to Ibn Saud on the 25th February to the effect that if he would give us an assurance that he was taking effective measures to prevent further raids and to punish the Mutair, air action in Nejd territory (otherwise than in hot pursuit of raiding parties) would be suspended.In the meantime messengers sent by the Sheikh of Kowiet to Ibn Saud to protest against the raids on his territory returned with the information that all the Alvhwan were definitely joining with the Mutair in a regular Jihad (Holy War) against all non-Akhwan. and that Ibn Saud (who was powerless to prevent it) had been forced to associate himself with this movement. On learning of this the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf tentatively suggested that it might be as well if two Brigades, together with the necessary Artillery, were held in readiness in India to embark at short notice for the defence of Koweit. The Political Agent at Koweit, however, and also the Air Officer Commanding, consider that no such reinforcements for the defence of Koweit or Iraq are at present required.There is still hope that Ibn Saud may be able to prevent the situation from passing entirely out of his control. From the language used in a letter, which left Riyadh at the same time as the Sheikh of Koweifs messengers, it would appear that he does not despair of being able to do so. Precautionary steps are being taken to provide for the early reinforcement of the Iraq Garrison by additional Aircraft and armoured cars should this prove necessary.Reference has already been made to the nature of the country in which the raids have been carried out; this presents no natural obstacle of any kind to hostile invasion, and aircraft may have to operate over an open front of 600 miles, which might be extended to 1.000 miles if Transjordan also becomes involved. They are already working from desert bases far in advance of those which could be utilised by regular ground forces. Supplies to these bases are being maintained by air. Moreover, the targets which have offered have consisted until recently of small and scattered parties of raiders. In operations of this character early and dramatic results cannot, of course, be looked for. Should, however, the raiders attack in large organised bodies, it will be easier to engage them when located with maximum effect. In the meantime, whilst the situation will require careful watching, there is no ground for undue disquiet.L. S. A.S. H.
