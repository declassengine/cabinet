sI circulate for the information of my colleagues extracts from my recent private correspondence with the Viceroy regarding the political situation in India in relation to the Indian Statutory Commission.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.2nd March 1028.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 2iUh February 1928.87 8. Private and personal. I have been discussing with my Council situation arising from adverse vote of Assembly on Statutory Commission, and favourable vote of Council of State, and you may like to know how our minds are moving. We have no doubt that it is desirable to proceed with principle of having a central Committee. To abandon this would deprive Commission of assistauce of Tudian view-point, which it is desirable they should have, would greatly discourage those who have supported scheme with object of being able to bring their views to bear ou Commission, aud would lie a confession that Government had been obliged, by opposition, to abandon part of proposals to which they had attached importance. Such action would adversely affect all those elements who desire to see Government, if need be, asserting itself over what they consider to be a noisy minority of unrepresentative politicians, and who are always ready lo complain that Government pays more attention to clamour of its enemies than to less articulate needs and wishes of its friends. 11&quot;. therefore, Assembly persist in their refusal to participate, we incline to view that Council of State should elect two or three Members, aud that balance should be nominated. In that event,-it would seem desirable to obtain the best possible men by nomination, aud uot restrict choice to Members of the Assembly. I am writing to-day tentatively to Simon on these lines, for, of course, we recognise that it is for the Commission to take the initiative in proposing any modification of the scheme of election by Central Legislature, which it has suggested. 1 assume also that, before any action is taken, we should report modified proposals to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as such scheme as I have indicated would be a departure from ideas contemplated by Parliament when setting up the Commission.2. The vital question, however, which will have to lie answered before the Commission leave India at the (Mid of March is whether we should assume Assembly have said their last word, and proceed now to constitute a Committee on some such lines as indicated above, or wait till August and give Assembly an opportunity of reconsidering its position. Considerations are rather evenly balanced, but, on the whole, 1 am fairly definitely inclined at present to the latter course. If we were to proceed at once with the formation of the Committee, it would be an unmistakable declaration of war on Assembly politicians and a final break&quot; with them. There is always possibility that opinion may change in the next six months, ami it may be that even now some of them do not really intend the full consequences of their words, ami would feel bitterly aggrieved if at this stage they were taken literally, and the dour finally closed On the other hand, it may be thought that if we constituted a Committee now, this would encourage our supporters who are anxious to proceed, would by settling finally the procedure at this stage secure support of those who are at. present wavering, and would enable Committee to prepare itself for its task during the hot weather, aud thus &quot;play a more important part in the enquiry. The Committee might also, during the absence of the Commission, be a useful focus for those with constructive ideas&quot; who at present incline naturally toward the all-parties Conference. I am telegraphing to all Coverings, -putf-ing-these considerations before them, and asking them how the two possible courses of action would be likely to affect opinion in their provinces and which appears to. them the.

these considerations to him. We shall probably be discussing the matter again after two or three weeks, when the situation may be somewhat clearer. We recognise the possibility that, if it were decided to \vait and a motion for election of a Committee were brought forward in the Assembly in August, the President might, in view of the resolution passed this session, decliue to allow it to be discussed. We should then be driven back on nomination, but no one could then contend that any other course was open.&apos;(. Tactical position as regards provincial Committees is possibly rather different. From the general point of view 1 think it is important, and Simon agrees, that wherever this is feasible resolutions should be passed this session affirming the principle of co-operation, or even, where this could be clone safely, that Committees should be actually elected. But, if there is any difficulty about electing Committees now, I see no objection to this being postponed till August or September. 1 am impressing 011 all Governors the desirability of as many Provincial Councils as possible committing themselves to the principle of co-operation. Madras and Central Provinces have already voted against it, Burma have just passed a favourable resolution, and Punjab hope very shortly actually to elect a Committee. I am also asking Governors whether, in the event of failure to secure a Provincial Committee by election, they recommend nominating a Committee. Considerations are similar to those stated earlier about Central Committee.4. Political situation may, of course, at any moment show signs of change, and the suggestions in para. I are, as you will recognise, entirely provisional, both as regards their own merits and as regards procedure, but 1 thought that you should be in possession of our mind in regard to matters that may emerge for decision later.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 28th February 192S.577. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 26th February. I have no doubt whatever that you are right in preferring to wait and give the Assembly a locus poenitentice and more than that to see how the situation develops throughout India, and I would earnestly beg you and Simon to give no sign whatever of what Commission is going to do or what you are contem-plating. The reception which his original pronouncement met from those it was intended to conciliate shows advisability of letting events take their course, and I think your overt attitude should be that which you say in last sentence of para. 2 of your letter of 9th February you iuteud to adopt regarding Bank Bill.The possibility you mention at the end of para. 2, that even if the locus poeuhentue were taken in august the President might disallow a motion brought forward in the Assembly then, could be obviated by your proroguing the Legislature at the end of March instead of adjourning it. This was done in 1921 and 1922, and, though it may not be usual, is there any reason to prevent your taking this course ?I am not sure what you mean in para. 1 by words &quot;a confession that Government had been obliged by opposition to abandon part of proposals to which they had attached importance.&quot; In first place it is not Government but Commission that is concerned, and I am very anxious to dissociate the two as far as possible. It is most desirable that Commission should not be regarded as under thumb of Government, and, on the other hand, that Government should not be credited with any mistakes Commission may make. In second place His Majesty s Government is not excessively enamoured of Simou&apos;s particular scheme of co-operation by Legislature, which went beyond what was contemplated here either at time of or after debates in Parliament and which some here regard with misgiving. Moreover, even our own more limited scheme of co-operation, we regarded as important, not so much because of any positive contribution Select Committee would be likely to make as because we thottght it. would appeal to Indian amour-propre. If it does not it loses its interest for us and Government nomination of Assembly members would still further deprive it of political value. So far as we are concerned, we are not anxious that Simon&apos;s scheme should be pressed in invitos ; but we are naturally unwilling to fetter a discretion which, from the nature of the case, must be his.Extract from a private letter from Lord Birkenhead to Lon/ Irwin,dated 1st March 192S.Your letter of the 9th February reached me practically simultaneously with your private telegram of the 27th February, S7 S., in which you made suggestions for
dealing with the situation resulting from the divergent decisions of the Assembly and the Council of State as to the attitude to be adopted towards the Statutory Commission. To the latter I replied two days ago in a telegram to the effect that 1 hold strongly the view that we should give the situation time to develop between uow and August, and that both Government and Simon, whose business it is more than Governments, would be well advised to avoid any further action in the direction of pressing on the boycott party opportunities which they have till uow rejected.This view, I am glad to see, corresponds pretty closely with that expressed in your letter of the 0th, in which you say that, after the rejection by the party leaders of Srmon&apos;s offer, you and Simon agreed that there was nothing more that could or ought to be done. If the Assembly&apos;s subsequent rejection of co-operation by the Commission, in confirmation of the party leaders&apos; intemperate decision, had been followed by a similar decision oy the Council of State, there would clearly have been no other course open to the Commission save to proceed with its task unaided. The fact that the Council of State has expressed its readiness to elect a Committee of its members to co-operate with the Commission rather alters the position, and affords a temptation to take some action at once to reinforce the effect which this decision is bound, in my view, to have upon the Assembly politicians. 1 think we ought to resist this temptation. If the members of the Assembly are to be saved from the consequences of their folly, let them be saved by the greater wisdom of the Council; and for the present my inclination is to let them repose where they have put themselves, and leave it to the Council of State to win them to a better frame of mind. This, it seems to me, it will be more likely to do if it sees that only if it succeeds iu doing so will there be any Joint Free Conference at all. But, as I said at the eud of my telegram, I am most unwilling to do or say anything that would letter Simon&apos;s discretion in any way; and he may feel that the Joint Free Conference plan must be pursued at all costs, and that if it is to be restricted in respect of the Central Legislature to co-operation with a Committee of the Council of State only, anil in respect of the Provincial Legislatures is to be existent at all only in relation to such as vote for co-operation, such co-operation will be too lop-sided to be of any-real value. If that proves to be his view, something would have to be done, no doubt, to redress the balance; but for the present my advice would be to let the situation develop of itself until the Assembly meets again, and do nothing save, by proroguing the Legislature in March, if that is possible, make it difficult for the President to refuse the Assembly on a technicality the opportunity to recant, if that be its wish.Your remarks on the weakness and vacillation of the average Indian politician strengthen my belief that after five months away from the rather peculiar atmosphere of Delhi a sufficient number of the members will quite possibly come round to the view that the Assembly would do well to follow the example of the Council of State. But in any ease I feel that we have done enough in the way of overtures, and that it would be a mistake to do much, if any, more towards attempting to save the Assembly from the consequences of its own decision Surely it is time for them to learn that &quot; give and take &quot; does not mean &quot; heads I give, tails you take.&quot; Still, I realty would prefer to leave matters of this kind to Simon&apos;s judgment.f have a fear that the incapacity of the extremists in the Assembly and in some of the Provincial legislatures to display any sense of the reality of the situation may somehow affect our judgment and cause us to overlook the very real fact that all this while from November till now these politicians have been producing very valuable evidence, more valuable perhaps than any that they could produce as members of a co-operating Committee, as to the political sagacity of the Indian party leader and his li mess for further political responsibility. This, after all, is not the least important ol the factors which the Commission has to take iuto consideration.
