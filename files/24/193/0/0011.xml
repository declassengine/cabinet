CABINET.CP.61  (88)--- SHOPS  (HOURS OF C1.0SIIIG) BILL./Sir Park Goff.) ilomorandum by the Hone Secretary.This Bill is the First Order on Friday March 9th.      sir Park Goff has undertaken it at the request of the Whips, but he has taken his own line on at least one point of major importance.The purpose of the Bill is to settle the vexed question of the general early closing of shops.     As my colleagues will remember, a Home Office Committee was appointed last year to consider the present Regulations which came into force during the war and which have been continued since by an Act of renewed each year bythe Expiring Laws Continuance Act.      They submitted a series of recommendations last November which I brought to the notico of my colleagues at the time.     The Committee, while recommending the permanent adoption of the principle of general early closing.hours, made a number of recommendations to meet particular points on which the existing Regulations had been severely criticised.      On the whole, the report of the Committee was well received in tho Press, but it was vigorously attacked in certain quarters, and the Bill will no doubt give rise to a good deal of controversial discussion in Committee.The question which will be most discussed is whether,  as recommended by lira. Philipson, who was one of the members of the Committee,  in a reservation to the Report, the Bill should allow a shopkeeper to keep his shop open to any hour that he pleases, provided he employs no one to assist him after the hours pronosed as the general closing hours.      Sir Park Goff has included a provision to thia effect in his Bill, and I understand that Mrs. Philipson is backing the Bill.The fact that he proposes to insert this provision has become   I known and I have already received a letter from the Early Closing Association intimating the strongest possible opposition to the.    .............g ..    -r-^. , , . -,------------- ^^........ ni i      n ............ ,,   ,,, ,, , ..... .. &apos;X
proposal and asking me to receive a joint deputation fron the Association, the National Chamber of Trade, which is representative of many classes of shops and shopkeepers, representatives of the snail shopkeepers, and representa-tives of the assistants.    It may be taken as quite certain that the shopkeepers -&quot;ill offer the strongest opposition .to the proposal.     The question at issue in a very old one.    It came up in connection with the earliest proposals for the early closing of shops and has been debated many times sinco.     The proposal to allow a shopkeeper to keep open after the closing hours fixed for his trade provided he worked alone has, however, always been rejected by Parliament.     Ho   such exemption appears in the principal Shops Act which was passed in 1912.      The letter from the Early Closing Association enumerates a number of grounds on which they object to the proposal, e.g. that the majority of the small traders (employing no assistants) themselves are against the exemption;    that the one-rran shops will not be able to choose whether to keep open or not - if some keep open competition will gradually ^orce or cause most of them to keep open also;-    that not only one man shops but also the owners of shops employing one, two, three or even more assistants, which are to some degree in competition with the small shops, will be forced to do the same;    that many such shops which at present close earlier than S p.rn. will at least be forced to keep open until 8 p.m. and this is causing great apprehension among the assistants.In addition to what is said in the letter from the Association there are certain considerations which seem to me to be of importance -The London and Suburban Traders Federation representing mainly one-man businesses gave evidence before the Committee to this effect (p.34)j    similar evidence was given by other bodies representing the small shopkeepers.
(l) If the shopkeeper&quot; is to be allowed to keep open his shop by himself after the general closing hours, it will be equally necessary to allow the street trader to carry on his trade after the general closing hours.     At present he is prohibited, by paragraph (b) of Article I of the Closing Order appended to the Act of 1020, from doing so.      This provision is itself based on the corresponding provision in Section 9 of the Shops Act, 1912.    The shopkeepers attach   the greatest possible importance to these provisions as a protection to them against unfair competition;    any weakening, and still more any removal, of the restrictions would be bitterly resented by them.(2) It is the intention of the promoters, as I understand, that tlis condition that no one besides the shopkeeper himself is to be employed in the shop after the closing hour is to be rigidly enforced,  e.g. he is not to be allowed the assistance of any member of his family.      The family shop has always been one of the main difficulties in connection with this question. A shop in which two or three members of the family are engaged as well as the owner may be doing quite as large a business as, and competing with, other shops in the neighbourhood which are employing two or three assistants.      I am -afraid, however, that the provisions in the Bill will not get over the difficulty It is easy to see how the shopkeeper could evo.de the provision, e.g. by taking the members of his family into oome kind of partnership.(3) The exemption will greatly increase the difficulty of administration by the local authorities.      At present the enforcement of the early closing provisions is comparatively easy.    There is no difficulty in most cases in seeing whether a shop is open or closed after the closing hours.     Under the exemption, the local authorities will have to see that members of the family, living on the premises, are not employed after the closing hours.      This will be difficult in any case, but
28th February,  1928.in the cans of a nixed shop selling both exempted and non-exempted articles, it will be practically impossible.    Inspection by the local authorities, if it is to be efficient in the case of shops v/hich remain open under this exemption, will have to be much closer, will take more time and cost more and -ill be much more inquisitorial.    The local authorities vill certainly not regard the change with favour (see ^p. p? to 5f of evidence- given before Committee).In my opinion the Government should resist the proposal in Committee and should announce their intention of doing so on the Second Reading, though a free Vote might be considered.There is certainly a strong Tory feeling in its favour.V/.
