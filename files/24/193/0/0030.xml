He went cn to sa.y that we had been reconsidering what we thought essential from the naval point of view, and he told ilonsieur Briand of the modified proposals which appear in Section 11* of the Admiralty memorandum of February 7th (P .R5 A*27 )&quot; a      British public opinion realised that concessiovis were necessary from all parties for a general settlement to be reached,  and if ho could point to a concessionft Circulated to Cabinet Committee only.0 Pv E T.81 (28).0 A B I N ET.COPi&apos; NO.
by the French in naval matters it would probably acquiesoa in his giving in on the military side.     On the other hand, we oould net abandon the British standpoint on tho question of Army Reserves unless we could justify this concession by pointing to a similar concession made to us in the Naval sphere.     He did not want to be driven in the matter of tho limitation of military reserves to vote against France with Germany,  and still less with Russia.Monsieur Briand said that thi3 must on no account happen. Experience at Geneva showed that if Great Britain and France stood together,, what they agreed upon would be accepted by others.     He then turned to the Russian proposals for complete dicanciLiCjont and said that they ought to be subjected at tho outset to some searching questions.      There were two forms of war:    ordinary war between nations, and civil war within nations;    the latter was hithsrto the avowed object cf the Union of the Socialist Soviet    Republics, whoso present scheme aimed only at preventing the first form.      They should be asked point-blank whether they equally abjured the other form.As regards procedure, Monsieur Briand suggested that when the Preparatory Commission met the Russian scheme should be referred to a Committee for these and other technical criticisms,  and that this period of examination should be used by the French and British to reach an understanding on their military and naval attitudes.Turning to the Navy, Lionsieur Briand asked for a personal copy of the revised Admiralty proposals of which Sir Austen Chamberlain had informed him.      He said that he would put them to the French Naval authorities and use all his influence to obtain their acceptance.If, however, he was to be Bucoeosful he would need our oo-operation.      He had often told the French Admiralty that. S.
1 or:a naval war with the British wafl out of tho question, and he was quite prepared to meet the criticism he had encountered for agreeing at Washington to a very small battleship allotment:    the French v/ould,  in fact, never vote money for large numbers of battleships.     The real naval crux for Prance was Italy.      At the Three-Power Conference the British arid the Americans had disagreed ever the basis of estimating cruiser requirements:    France had vis-a-vi3 Italy much the same case that we had as regards the United States.      In each oase our oversea responsibilities were much greater and our soa communications much longer.     It would be to our mutual advantage, when the proper time case,  jointly to press that those factors should form the basis of assessment of tho cruiser strength which States could justifiably claim. Sir Austen Chamberlain undertook tc have this idea studied by the competent authorities on his return home.Sir Austen Chamberlain and Lord Cushendun di-cussed tho above exchange of viows the same evening; Admiral Kelly and Kr, Cadogan were present.It was agreed that as regards the Russian proposals, Monsieur 3riand&apos;s idea corresponded almost exactly with our own:    at the same time,  it was not for us,  in view of our special relations - or absence of relations - with Russia,  to bell the Russian oat.      Mr.  Cadogan was therefore instructed to repeat privately to Count Olauzol nonsiour Briand&apos;s remarks about the question to bo put to the Russians and the procedure to be adopted,  and was to suggest that if Count Clauzol would propose this line at the Preparatory Commission, he oould count unreservedly upon our prompt and loyal support.      If Count Clauzel was reluctant himself to take th9 lead,  it would be equally satisfactory if he persuaded the representative of one of France&apos;a allies to do so.
1 9t?Ae regards the naval and military questions, it was agreed that llonsieur 3riar;d&apos;3 proposal was a sufficiently satisfactory basis of negotiation to recommend for the consideration of the Admiralty in the first instance and later of the Cabinet.       As far as thG near future was concerned, it offered hope of an Anglo-French agreement by the time the two draft Diearmament texts cane to be read a second time -possibly in July;    in the rsmotsr future - viz. the Disarmament Conference and possible negotiations preliminary to it - it would at any rate ensure that we had French support in a matter vital to us, whereas at present we had none, having alienated at the Three-Power Conference the Americans, who had been our ally at the Preparatory Commission.Admiral Kelly undertook to put in the form of a private letter for Austen Chamberlain to hand to Monsieur Briand tho Admiralty compromise proposals:    the initiative a3 regards Monoieur Briand&apos;s own proposal for the basis of estimating cruiser strength would be left to the French0Finally,  as regards the immediate position. Mr.  Cadogan was instructed to make it absolutely clear to Count Glauzel, as from Sir Austen Chamberlain,  that we would not tolerate any insinuation free the French that the adjournment, upon which we were now mutually agreed, was due to our intransigeance in naval matters:    if we learnt that they were putting this about, we should give cut categorically that the real obstacle to a second reading was the French refusal to limit in any way their trained reserves - a question on which we could come to an agreement with tho Germans, if we so wished,  at any moment.FOREIGN OFFICE.10th Maroh3 1928.
