Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary or State for Foreign Affairs.I draw my colleagues&apos; particular attention to my telegram No. 21 to Sir 3. Barton for Sir Liles Lampson.I felt it necessary to reply at orce lest Sir Miles should becorv.e conaf&amp;tted to what I hold to be humiliating and inadmissible surrender.If any of my colleagues dissent, I beg that they will ask the Prime Linlster to call the Catinet together at once.Sir A. Chamberlain to Sir 3. Barton (Larch 14th, 1928. (No. 21.)immediate.&quot;Following for Sir L. Lannson.Your telegrams Nos. 19, 21 to 27 (of Larch 10th; Nank ing outrage).1.     The proponed settlement comprised in the series of documents to be exchanged appears to me to be open to most serious, objection.     It is impossible that you should give any countenance.to the terms of paragraph 4 of the note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs contained in your telegram No. 24 which charge us with bombarding the city.     The city was not bom-bard ed and the firinn which took place alone saved a massacre of our own and other nationals.     For cur action we can express no regret and accept no blame such as would be inferred from the proposed reply which appears to me to be a complete surrender to the Chinese involving a perversion of the truth and a humiliation which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept.
2.    Paragraph 5 Id open to a similar criticism. The views of Hie Majesty1s Government on treaty revision were clearly stated. In our December memorandum and treaty alteration proposals.     The question however has nothing whatever tc do with the Nanking Incident and is only dragged in for the purpose of insinuating that exasperation over the unequal treaties was the cause of, and offers an excuse for the outrages.     I am willing to facilitate in any way possible a reasonable settle-ment, but nothing would be gained by a surrender to these dishonest pretences.3.     The actual settlement itself appears to be hardly more satisfactory than the two clauses referred to above.     Though our origin.:! demands have already been greatly whittled down I am prepared to waive specific allusion to the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief in the letter of regrets though it would be reasonable that he should express his own regret that he had not been able to prevent the outrages since his troops were already in the town.     In the order relating to punishments, however, the lists of - names convey the impression of being pure camouflage.     Would it not be better to refuse to accept any such lists, unless you are satisfied that the individuals in question were in fact the real culprits and were tried and executed for complicity in the anti-foreign outrages of March 24th?
4.   A further test of the value of the settlement is the adequacy of the reparations, out all that we secure by the draft note in telegram No. 24 is the appointment of a joint commission without any guarantee that the sums assessed will be ade-quate or will ever be paid.   Moreover if the com-missioners disagree as to the principles upon which they are to work there is no authority provided who can oettle the dispute.   Since this telegram was drafted your telecrams Nos. 25, 23 and 27 have been received.   They confirm my previous impression as to the unsatisfactory nature of the settlement now offered.5*    These considerations suggest the con-clusion that the only object which the Chinese have in view in these negotiations is to secure from us a humiliating avowal in return fcr a wholly in-adequate settlement.   I am of opinion therefore that it would be more dignified to break off these dis-cussions altogether and inform the Nationalist government that we must now leave them to take such action in the matter as they think fit.   If they ere sincere in their desire for a settlement, they might for example establish conditions in Nanking which would make it safe for foreign habitation and for our Consul General to resume residence there; they might also announce the punishments inflicted in consequence of the events of March 24th and give proof that they have punished the real culprits and pay
pay over a lump sum of Bay one million dollars to be applied towards compensation of the chief in-dividual sufferers pending ascertainment of full damages incurred.   If they give this or similar proof of their sincere desire to wipe out the stain upon their good name we could resume negotiations and a satisfactory settlement honourable to both sides could easily be reached.   But if, as is probable, they prefer their present tortuous and equivocal methods the only dignified course would appear to be to refuse to be drawn into such dis-cussions and to allow the incident to sink slowly into oblivion.In the meanwhile the non-settlement of this incident need not imply non-resumption of direct conta.ct and establishment of relations with the Nanking government through His Majesty&apos;s Consul - General in that city.   But it is for that govern-ment to make this possible by taking the proper steps for maintaining order and enabling His Majesty&apos;s Consul General to return to reside in suitable quarters and in perfect security.   In short, seeing that we are the aggrieved party and that it is for the Nanking government to make the first ad-vances can we really defend the acceptance of such humiliating terms in order to safeguard material interests however great and can we be sure that it would produce this result?Please telegraph your observations.Repeat to Peking and Tokyo.&quot;
