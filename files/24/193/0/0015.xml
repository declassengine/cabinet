Printed Jor the Cabinet, February, 1928.SECRET.Copt No.   3 0CP. 65 (28)THE CABINET.THE DISBANDMENT  OF THE WEST AFRICAN REGIMENT.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The War Office is responsible for the Coast defence troops and the West African Regiment, and the Colonial Office for the battalion of the West African Frontier Force.In the case of the colonies in Africa other than Sierra Leone, no defence expenditure is now borne by Army funds.2. The sole contingency in which Sierra Leone would be subject to external attack in present circumstances is that of war with France. This contingency, however, is extremely remote, and the present strategic situation does not, therefore, in the opinion of tiie Army Council, justify the maintenance of the West African Regiment as a charge on Army funds.3. The Army Council consequently submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. 303-C) that unless the Colony required to keep the West African Regiment for purposes of internal security and was willing to pay for it (sharing the cost, if need be, with neighbouring colonies) there would be no alternative to its disbaudment.4. The matter came before the Committee of Imperial Defence on 1st November, 1927, when the following conclusion was reached : &quot; That the West African Regiment at Sierra Leone should cease to be a charge on War Office Estimates, and that the Secretary of State for War should discuss with the Secretary of State for the Colonies (in consultation, if desired, with the Cabinet Committee on military contributions by the Colonies) the future dispositions to be made as a result of this conclusion ; and that unless they are able to arrive at some arrangement for maintenance on Colonial Votes, the West African Regiment should be disbanded.&quot;5. I have been in communication with the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject, and he has decided that the West African Regiment cannot be maintained at the expense of Colonial funds. The disbandment of the Regiment is, therefore, inevitable, and I propose now to take the necessary steps to carry it into effect.1. The garrison of Sierra Leone at present consists of 074(i) Coast Defence troops.(ii) West African Regiment.(iii) One battalion of the West African Frontier Force.9141L.
