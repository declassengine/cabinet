January 27, 1028.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.I W 748/28/98] No. 1.Memorandum respecting the British Government and Arbitration.A n Historical Review.RECENT discussions on arbitration have generally been of a theoretical and abstract character. To a very small extent have they taken into consideration actual experience, and yet this experience has been very considerable. It may therefore be of interest, and perhaps even of practical value, to review the past history, with special reference to the record of the British Government; such a survey can scarcely fail to throw valuable light on the nature, uses and limitations of the arbitral pro-cedure and to show how far it can be used to supplement other methods of arriving at a peaceful settlement of international disputes.2. The enquiry naturally begins with the celebrated arbitration conducted with the United States under the Jay Treaty of 1794; an epoch is marked by the meeting of The Hague Peace Conference and the establishment of The Hague Court in 1899, and the historical investigation must cease with the outbreak of war in 1914. With the conclusion of peace and the establishment of the League of Nations in 1920 a new era begins. Lists of all cases in which arbitration was used during these hundred and twenty years have been compiled; the number is imposing; according to one authority, there have been 130 cases; according to another, over 200. (&apos;) That which at once emerges from any general survey is the very important part that has been taken by Great Britain and the United States. According to Politis. G^reat Britain was concerned in seventy-one cases, the United States in sixty-nine; noticeable also is the number of arbitrations in which the South American republics have, been con-cerned. This, of course, is due almost entirely to the influence of the United States. Arbitration between European States has been very rare and almost entirely confined to colonial and maritime affairs. In the years ending 1871, out of about 45 cases, Great Britain was concerned in 23. the United States in 24, the South American republics in 16; those in which none of these countries participated were only 6, of which 2 only were between European States. (&quot;)3. International arbitration is, indeed, the invention of Great Britain &quot;and the United States. It is one of the important contributions which these countries have made to our modern political machinery. This is not accidental. It is the applica-tion to international affairs of habits which the two kindred races have learned by long practice in self-government. In both. countries the Law Courts have often played a great part in the development and elucidation of political problems, and there was therefore nothing strange, that in a similar manner a legal decision might be invoked on international as well as internal questions. If we read the arguments in any of the great arbitration cases between these two States, as, for instance, the &quot; Alabama &quot; or the Newfoundland Fisheries, it is difficult to realise that we have to do not with a sitting of the Judicial Court of the Privy Council or the Supreme Federal Court, but with an international court in which the counsel belong to two opposed nations. If there is a difference, it is that the national courts have at times had to deal with matters graver even than those brought before the. international, as in the case of ship money, the trial of the seven bishops, the Dred Scot case, and perhaps we may add in more modern times the Taff Vale decision, each of which brought about a grave crisis, leading in some cases to the threat, in others to the reality, of rebellion and civil war.   No verdict in an international arbitration has(*) The most important work dealing with the subject is that by Politis anil Lapiadelle, &quot; Recueil des Arbitrages interuationaux&quot; ; this, however, has only been completed clown to the year 1871. Mr. Evans Darby has compiled a list, &quot; International Tribunals &quot; ; tho standard work by Mr. J. B. Moore, &quot; International Arbitrations,&quot; is confined to those in which the Government of tho United States has taken part. A valuable historical survey of the whole period is contained in Politis, &quot; La Justice internationalo.&quot; There does not. seem to bo any special work dealing: with this subject published in England; we have not even any satisfactory monograph on tho &quot;Alabama&quot; case.(-) Colitis and Lapradolle; they include, however, in their enumeration several cases which, though of real legal interest, cannot politically be regarded aa genuine instances of international arbitration botween two sovereign States, and it is this with which we aro here alone concerned.4296   [17155] b
had similar consequences. The reason for this we. shall see later ; but under a system in which arbitration were compulsory, when a State could be compelled against its own will to accept reference on a debated matter to a court of judicature, we can scarcely doubt that a verdict which might be unacceptable to one party, but which would be enforced by international sanctions, would be attended by consequences equally disastrous.4. Especially noteworthy, therefore, are the long series of arbitrations in which these countries have, been the two parties; they are as varied as they are numerous; they include the settlement of important territorial questions, and cognate to &quot;and arising out of these, such matters as the fishery rights on the Newfoundland coast and in the. Behring Sea. They include also questions of the highest political importance, such as rights and duties of neutrals during a war, and, in addition, the very numerous private claims which were dealt with in the great arbitrations of 1804 and 1853, in the first of which over 500, and in the second over 115. separate cases were adjudicated. The record is all the more remarkable when we recall the political history of the times; throughout the whole of the century after the peace of 1814 our differences with America were more persistent and just as serious as those with any other country. Again and again there was acute friction and animosity between the two countries; again and again, as a consequence of differences which seemed of vital moment, they were brought to the verge of war; often there were gravely provocative pronouncements, such as those of Mr. Sumner on the &quot; Alabama &quot; claims, of Mr. Olney in regard to Venezuela, or the remarkable resolu-tion of Congress impugning the right of Great Britain to federate the North American colonies into a Dominion; and on occasions no doubt some representatives of this country pressed their case beyond what could be maintained, as, for example, Lord Russell in his correspondence with Mr. Adams about the &quot;Alabama&quot; case-But there have always been on both sides men of weight and insight who interposed before any irrevocable step had been taken, and underlying was present in both countries a consciousness that it was the duty and interest of both to find some method of peaceful settlement; in this connexion it would be impossible not to refer to the wise reserve and discretion which was shown by the House of Commons in many of the most critical episodes. A settlement was always arrived at by methods of diplomacy and peaceful agreement, and, among the methods available, on many occasions that of arbitration was resorted to; from this experience the two countries have developed a clear sense of the occasions on which arbitration may be con-veniently used to supplement diplomacy and negotiation. In doing so. they have had before them a great purpose to which expression was given by Mr. Gladstone, when, speaking in 1872 on the &quot; Alabama &quot; question, he said in the House of Commons: But this importance is greatest of all with respect to its bearing on the subject of arbitration, and upon the future interests of the world, for England and America undertook a great responsibility in the face of all other nations when they attempted to apply, after some recent discouragements, this principle of amicable settlement to a great controversy between two high-spirited nations; and if these two nations succeed in giving effect to what undoubtedly is the desire sincerely entertained, and cordially entertained, alike on the one side and on the other, something, I think, will be achieved for the benefit of the cause of peace..&quot;5. This is the atmosphere in which arbitration has been born and flourished. How different is it if we turn elsewhere to the diplomatic history of Europe and the relation of Great Britain to European Powers. Throughout the whole of the 19th century it is difficult to find a single case in which two other Great Powers have resorted to arbitration on any question of real interest and importance, (3) and in matters arising out of disputes upon the continent of Europe the method was practically unknown. This country, which has so often arbitrated with the United States, has for continental affairs never done the same; we may search in vain for illustrations of arbitration arising out of the classical diplomatic discussions con-cerning affairs such as the Eastern question, the Danish Duchies or the establishment of the Kingdoms of Italy and of Greece, the diplomatic discussion of which extended over many years.6. It is, perhaps, just because, of the wide experience which they have acquired that Great Britain and the United States have shown themselves so reluctant to(3) Hut see below, paragraph -12.
assent to any universal agreement for compulsory arbitration. They know not only the value of arbitration but also its limitations. The historical difference has, indeed, caused what may be fairly described as a fundamental difference in the approach and attitude towards arbitration. In this country and in America it has from long experience become closely interwoven with the actual management of foreign affairs ; at any rate, since about 1860 there has been scarcely a single British Foreign Secretary who has not had personal experience of arbitration and found himself in the situation that he must decide whether or not it was. in some particular instance, suitable and desirable. In the same way the legal advisers of the Government have accumulated a great store of practical experience as to the technical working of the system. Elsewhere this element in the past was not largely represented, and in con-sequence interest in arbitration has been more widely spread among the academic and theoretical writers on international law than among men of affairs. Their approach is more systematic, more idealistic, and perhaps, therefore, more Utopian, and there may have been some disposition to assign to arbitration a position in diplo-niatic procedure greater than that to which it is entitled.7. We must now carry our investigation a stage further, and begin by clearly defining what is meant by arbitration and how it differs from other methods of peaceful settlement, such as diplomacy, conciliation, mediation. To this the answer can be clear and definite. Arbitration implies (1) the reference of a dispute either to a single individual or to a commission or court so constituted that, apart from unforeseen accidents, they cannot avoid issuing an award; (2) a previous agreement that the award, whatever it may be (unless, of course, there is clear evidence of bribery, unjust influence, or unless the award obviously goes outside the questions submitted), will be accepted as definitely closing the controversy. The essence of the whole thing is that it issues in an award which is authoritative and final.(&apos;) and it is in this element of finality that, politically, the special importance of arbitration lies. A State which has agreed to accept an arbitral award, thereby, so far as the award goes, definitely surrenders its own free will, and has irrevocably condemned itself to passive submission. It is in this that the essential difference between arbitration and other methods of peaceable settlement lies, and this obviously is the reason why on important questions States have been so reluctant to adopt the method. This is also the reason why those who desire to build up a complete and watertight system which will necessarily, without equivocation, provide a peaceful settlement of every kind of international dispute, concentrate attention on arbitra-tiou. It becomes a last resort when every other method of reaching an understanding has failed, and it thereby acquires in the theoretical discussions an importance to which, as will be seen, it has not yet historically established a claim.S. For this reason many cases which are often loosely referred to as having been settled by arbitration, do not really fall under this category. There is, for instance, a radical distinction between reference to a mixed commission in which the two parties are equally represented, and real arbitration, for when the former procedure is adopted, each of the Governments concerned knows that an adverse decision cannot be given against it, except with the consent of at least one of its own representatives. This gives very strong security that the decision will not be influenced by political prejudice, and that the commissioners will not be guided by rides of law which are not recognised by one or other of the contending parties. This procedure, therefore, avoids the danger to which the British Government have always been very sensitive,, that they may find themselves in the position of being compelled to surrender interests of real importance, by virtue of a judgment, the justice and impartiality of which is not convincing. This, for instance, is the procedure which was adopted in the Penjdeh dispute, which is often incorrectly spoken of as having been settled by arbitration. The very serious boundary question at issue was settled by a mixed commission of two, and no arbitration was used.(*) For this reason, also, it does not seem strictly correct to say that the Alaska boundary was settled by arbitration. The court on this occasion consisted of six members, three appointed by each of the parties, and an award was only secured owing to the fact that the British representative, Lord Alverstone, gave a verdict adverse to the British claims.   The fact that he did so might well appear incontrovertible evidence(.&apos;) This is clearly indicated both in the Covenant of the League of Nations and iu article 4 of the Geneva Protocol. The importance of securing finality was strongly pressed by Mr. Olney in his criticism of the proposal for a general Arbitration Treaty between Great Britain and the United States made by Lord Salisbury in 1896.(5) Seo below, paragraph 26.[17155] b 2
that these claims were legally not well founded, but there was clearly a fundamental difference from the point of view of the British Government between referring the case to a court so constituted and referring it to one in which the award would have been determined by the judgment of one or more neutral and foreign judges.9. With this definition in our minds we can now proceed to a more detailed analysis of past arbitrations. In doing so we shall have to concentrate on two points : first, the nature of the subjects submitted to arbitration; and secondly, the nature of the arbitral procedure itself. As we shall see, the two are very closely interwoven, for the machinery which has been developed under the existing system of voluntary arbitration gives to the interested -States the opportunity in each case of exercising very stringent supervision over the precise formulation of the subjects which are referred to the court: in other words, even after they have accepted the principle of arbitration, they have the power, which they have always freely used, of refusing to include in the reference points which they do not consider suitable.10. The great majority of past arbitrations deal with two clearly defined groups of subjects, namely, private claims and boundary disputes. In each of these there has been accumulated a mass of experience which is sufficient to justify important and useful general conclusions.Private Claims.11. These are very numerous: they arise when private individuals or companies represent to their Government that they have suffered injustice at the hands of a foreign Government. If there is sufficient primd facie evidence that the complaint is well founded, then the Government takes up the case, and it becomes the subject of direct negotiations between the two Governments. Claims of this kind are in the majority of cases of no particular moment; the issues at stake are often small and no political principles are involved. They fall in general under the following headings: (1) Pecuniary claims for failure to carry out a contract made by a Government or to pay a debt due for work clone or services rendered, of which the most important is the Anglo-American suit against the Portuguese Government about the Delagoa Railway of 1S90; (2) denial of justice by the courts in a suit instituted by an alien resident against a native: (3) claims for compensation due for injury to property or persons, or for illegal detention.(*)12. In this matter of private claims the British Government has had great experience, greater than that of any other country, not excluding the United States, and it is very largely due to British initiative and British co-operation that there has accumulated a mass of evidence and experience sufficient to establish the broad general principle, which is now nearly universally accepted, that unless there is some exceptional objection, all such claims should be referred to arbitration at an early stage. It was natural enough that Great Britain should take a leading part in this movement. These private claims most often arise in undeveloped States where there is chronic disorder, where revolutions are common, and where the authority of the Government is weak. They hardly ever arise from events which have taken place on the continent of Europe; claims against a European State nearly always have to do with colonial possessions or incidents at sea. There is, however, no part of the world, however disorderly, where British merchants, traders and industrialists are not to be found, and the general principle that they shall enjoy the protection of the British Government in their lawful enterprises is of paramount importance to British industry and trade. Just for this reason there is no country which has so strong an interest in bringing about a peaceful and regular method for dealing with such disputes.13. The historical record is conclusive. In the earlier years arbitration was rare, and if used was only called in at a comparatively late stage. Serious inconvenience resulted. A British subject had, for instance, a private law suit with a Portuguese subject of wealth and influence.  He brought it before the courts; year(6) Claims of bond-holders for non-payment of interest are not included, for the British Government has generally given it to be understood that they are under no obligation to help in the recovery of money which has been lost in consequence of a perhaps speculative investment in foreign (Government loans There has, of course, been intervention, as in the classical cases of the Turkish and Egyptian bond-holders, but the procedure adopted has been quite different from that usual in other private claims, and save for the exceptional case of Venezuela, there has been no recourse to arbitration. The whole matter is one of great, difficulty and importance because of the large sums of money sometimes at stake, and, as in the case of Egypt, intervention has led to very serious political consequences. Especially difficult are those cases in which the default of the Government is due not merely to lack of funds, but there has been an open repudiation of liability, as by the Soviet Government in Russia, but this cannot bo dealt with here.
alter year elapsed without his being able to get a final and decisive verdict; when one was given in his favour, it was then,as was suggested, owing to political influence, over-ridden. British ships were seized and subjects attacked, thrown into prison, and detained for some months by colonial authorities on what appeared to be an unjust charge.  A British subject resident in Peru during a time of revolution was imprisoned and his property confiscated on a charge of complicity in the revolu-tionary movement, which he denied.   Numerous similar charges were made against the Government of Venezuela for breach of contract, for non-payment of debts, and for interference with property and personal liberty.   In each case the British Government, assuming that there was a prima facie cause, to believe the claim well-founded, took it up and made official representations.   Often enough this was ineffectual; the other Government either denied liability, contended that the facts represented were untrue, or simply failed to do anything.   Exaggerated points of honour were raised; the Government would contend that it was derogatory to it that the actions of its officials or the decisions of its courts should be submitted to investigation and possible censure.  In this matter the British Government were not always free from blame, as, for instance, when they contended in a well-known case thai it was contrary to their honour to recognise that young naval officers, while returning from an evening party in civilian dress, might under the inlluence of drink have l)een guilty of disorderly conduct.(7)   Intolerable delays often ensued; twenty or thirty years went by and no decision was reached: it became necessary either to drop the case or to proceed to more forcible measures.  Sometimes the British Govern-nient itself did not think the claim worth pursuing, but were forced by popular agitation or discussion in Parliament to do so. as when Mr. Ileadlam. in 1867, moved an amendment to the address because the Poreign Office wished to drop the claim of the &quot; Mermaid.&apos;&apos; which had been shot at and sunk by a Spanish fort on the charge that it had failed to comply with certain port rules.   Re.-ort to forcible measures, such as the seizure of ships, the establishment of a blockade, the breaking off of diplomatic relations, as in the case of Brazil, Venezuela or Greece, was most unsatisfactory.   It might well be. and often was. from the mere monetary point of view, more costly than the claim which it was intended to enforce.   Moreover, what was originally a small private matter was expanded until it assumed serious and even dangerous political proportions.   It put us in an invidious position; it might easily appear to be an unjustifiable abuse of power.   Sometimes, indeed, there may have been justification for this charge.   More often it was the other way about,   it was the powerful State which required protection from the unjustified action of a weak and irresponsible Government.   The greatest disadvantage was that under this procedure we were compelled to demand satisfaction for claims which had not been thoroughly tested.  The British Government was not in a position itself to test them: it could not call evidence; it could not have a formal enquiry: it could not thoroughly investigate either the statements of the complainant or the case of the defendant. It was therefore natural enough that sometimes, when after long and acrimonious discussion extending over many years, the case was eventually brought to arbitration, it was decided that the claim was either ill-founded or very much exaggerated.   The classical instance is that of Don Pacifico.  He claimed damages on the ground of loss of property in a riot, and denial of justice.   The British Government pressed his claim; Avhen it was refused they resorted to seizure of ships and blockade; small in itself, the case, because of the attention it attracted, became of real political importance; it led to diplomatic intervention by Russia and France; in the end, owing to their insistence, it was referred to arbitration, and the court awarded to Don Pacifico. who had claimed over  20,000, the sum of  147.  Nobody can now doubt that it would have been wiser to submit it to arbitration at an early stage, and the experience gained on this occasion is certainly one of the reasons why later Governments, in order to avoid being entangled in so unfortunate a situation, showed themselves more and more ready to demand arbitration.(&quot;) In 1873 the United States refused u proposal of the Spanish Government that the ease of the Virginias&quot; should be submitted to arbitration on the ground that the subject was one of national honour, &apos; of which the nation must be judge and custodian.&quot; There hail no doubt in this case been a very  rave offence by the Spanish authorities in Cuba, who had seized an American ship on the high seas, aud under martial law tried, condemned and executed some fifty of those on board, of whom a considerable number were American citizens and British subjects; their justification for this action was that they were, in fact, guilty of piracy. It eventually emerged that the &quot; Virginius&quot; had no right to use the American flag; her papers had been obtained fraudulently, and she was not American owned. The United States insisted that their claims should be carried out, and an indemnity of 80,000 dollars was paid by the Spanish Government. Looking back, it appears as though the matter was one which might well have been dealt with by arbitration.
14. Among tJie most instinctive cases is that of the establishment of a mixed commission by the treaty of the 8th February, 1853, between the United States and Great Britain. To this there were to be referred a large number of claims made by both Governments on behalf of private individuals, who represented that they had incurred unlawful loss and damage. These claims were of various kinds. A considerable number were connected with the slave trade; ships sailing under the American flag had been seized and condemned by British cruisers on the ground that they were in reality occupied in this trade. Others arose out of fishing disputes off the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In all cases the claims were of a small amount; it does not appear that any vital questions of law were concerned: what was required was to ascertain the precise facts, to get an opinion based on this examination as to whether there was a liability, and, if so, to assess the damages:C est le moment qu&apos;avec une profonde sagesse, les deux grandes nations choisirent pour etouffer entre elles tous les inhniment petits de la discorde, germes obscurs dont la fermentation lente est dangereuse en cas de crise; affaires sans gravite. toutes pecuniaires, plus nuisibles aux particuliers que dommage-ables aux  tats, dont quelques-unes avaient ete fameuses, mais qui toutes. en ce moment, se trouvaient ega lenient attenuees par le temps.&quot;(&quot;)15. The accumulated experience has been well set out in a memorandum by the legal advisers : (&quot;)As an instance of the intolerable delay which under present practice usually accompanies the arbitration of such pecuniary claims, it is well to quote the .  following from a paper written a year ago on the work of the Pecuniary Claims Commission which is dealing with the outstanding claims between this country and the United States : &quot; This commission has up till now decided thirty-four claims. Of these only three were less than ten years old by the time the tribunal gave its decision, the age of the claim being reckoned for this purpose from the occurrence out of which it arose. Of these three, one was seven years old, another was eight, and the third was just under ten. Of the remaining thirty-one claims, the age of twelve claims was between eleven years and twenty: of eleven claims, between twenty years and thirty; of three, between thirty and forty: of four, between forty and fifty, and one was over a hundred, having arisen in 1812 and been decided in 1914.&quot; It is much the same with the claims which are still awaiting decision. One claim arose in 1812. another in 1845. A group of thirteen claims, for a refund of customs duties, arose in 1876; another group in 1895; another group in 1898. With the exception of a group of claims against the Newfoundland Government on behalf of American fishing vessels for violation of Newfoundland fishing statutes, it is difficult to find a single claim still awaiting adjudication which is not earlier in origin than the present century.&quot;Apart from the injustice of keeping individuals waiting so long for the settlement of claims where such claims are good, the interests of the respondent State are not served by a system under which it is open to it to refuse arbitration for so long as it pleases, but where, nevertheless, circumstances may sooner or later oblige it to agree. The only result is that when the claim does come up for arbitration, the collection of the necessary evidence to rebut it is rendered far more difficult, and the tribunal is frequently prejudiced by the continued efforts to avoid arbitration.16. The general conclusion to be drawn was first recognised by the British Government, and Lord Salisbury, in 1896, prepared and communicated to the American Government the draft&apos;of a General Arbitration Treaty which, among other things, provided that all pecuniary claims or groups of pecuniary claims &quot; which do not in the aggregate exceed  100,000 in amount and which do not involve the determination of territorial claims &quot; should be submitted to an arbitral tribunal, which would be so constituted that it could not fail to issue an award, and the award was to be final. This treaty was, for other reasons, of great historical importance; it appears to be the first proposal which had been officially made for a general arbitration agreement, and the only one which was previous to the meeting of The(y) Lnprndello and Politis, vol. I, p. 662. (&quot;j Confidential Print 13100, Juno 1020.
Hague Peace Conference. It is very remarkable that so novel a proposal should have been made by one of so cautious and conservative a disposition as Lord Salisbury. The proposal was accepted by President Cleveland, but it fell to the ground eventually because it-did not secure the approval of the American Senate. It was, however, undoubtedly the influence of Lord Pauncefote, who in 1896 was Ambassador at Washington, and to whom had been entrusted the negotiations in regard to Lord Salisbury&apos;s treaty, which led the First Hague Conference in 1899 to conclude the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes; this set up the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and thereby constituted a great land-mark in the progress of the machinery of arbitration. The question of pecuniary claims was brought up again at the Second Hague Conference, and in 1907 a special convention was agreed on to the effect that force should not be used until after arbitration had been offered and refused.17. These considerations do not apply when assaults on individuals or their property are systematic, deliberate, or show a political object, and they affect only disputes between fully civilised States. When there has been an assault on a person or destruction of property in a country in which a practical state of anarchy exists, or which does not recognise the principles of peaceful intercourse now generally accepted, it will often be necessary to demand and enforce immediate redress without waiting for any full judicial enquiry. This is why in the past arbitration has never been used in connexion with the offences against Europeans in China, even where definite rights have been secured to them by treaty; at any rate, some of these episodes, as for instance, the seizure of the &quot; Lorcha Arrow.&quot; which was one of the eases which brought about open warfare, would have been particularly suitable for judicial enquiry, inasmuch as it turned on obscure points of law and of fact. It was, however, impossible for any European Government to accept the position that its subjects should be dealt with under the Chinese Law, which, in the case of a murder, required indeed an equivalent sacrifice, but was not concerned that the person punished should be really guilty. None the less, looking back now there can be little doubt that it would have been to the advantage of both parties that whenever possible the facts should have been elucidated and the damages assessed by an impartial tribunal.18. Private claims are. however, not always so simple. It has often happened that the claim for redress by a private individual or individuals has been the particular manner in which differences of great importance between the two Governments have been brought to a definite issue, and the verdict on the justice of a private claim becomes, therefore, a legal decision on questions of the highest public importance. This applies particularly to the whole question of the rights and obligations of neutrals during war. It first arose in 1798, when American seamen claimed compensation for illegal seizure by British cruisers under Orders in Council: there were similarly adverse claims by British seamen for the seizure by privateers which had been illegally equipped for the service of France on American soil. In fact, also, the &quot; Alabama &quot; claims were of this nature. It is clear that it would be impossible for the British Government, without very careful consideration, to submit claims of this kind direct to an arbitral court, for by doing so they would in effect be submitting the validity of Government action, as expressed by Orders in Council and also decisions of the Court of Admiralty, to the judgment of a court which would not improbabl)- be influenced by rules of law not recognised by this country. The matter is of fundamental importance and is discussed later in connexion with the &quot; Alabama &quot; case.Boundary Disputes.19. The second great group of arbitrations contains those which have to do with questions of frontiers and boundaries. With regard to them it is to be noted first, that they are almost exclusively concerned with colonial territories, especially the fixing of boundaries in countries which have not been adequately explored and mapped; secondly, that the great territorial problems have not been settled by arbitration but by war or diplomacy, and that arbitration has been used only with regard to secondary and comparatively minor matters which have arisen in the interpretation or application of the governing treaties embodying the terms of the diplomatic settlement. Arbitration was, for instance, frequently used in deter-niining the frontier between Canada and the United States; the main outlines of the frontier were, however, set out in the Treaty of Peace of 1783, and with regard
to the western frontier, the Oregon question, in the treaty of 1S46. The situation had been extremely serious; by putting forward a claim for all territory up to the parallel 54-40, the United States had, in effect, threatened to cut off Canada from access to the Pacific. This, involving as it did questions vital to the whole future of the British Colonies in North America, was never submitted to arbitration. The matter was dealt with under the ordinary diplomatic procedure, by direct negotia-tions, and a compromise was arrived at by which the parallel of 49 was accepted as the frontier. It was by diplomacy and not by arbitration that war, which was imminent, was avoided. Only at a later stage was arbitration used, when the com-paratively minor question of San Juan was in 1871 submitted to the arbitration of the German Emperor. The celebrated Alaskan Boundary Commission of 1903 had also to deal not with the major but with the minor point. The major point had been settled when the Government of the United States acquired the territory of Alaska by purchase from Russia and when the British Government, who well might have challenged this act, not on the ground that it was illegal, but that it was a grave prejudice to Canada, acquiesced without protest. Many years subsequent to this, the details of the boundary, which were obscure, were settled by a Mixed Commission.(&quot;&apos;) During the negotiations by which the continent of Africa was divided between the European Powers, in every case the major territorial question was settled not by arbitration but by negotiation and treaty. Arbitrations, of which there have been several, have been subsequent and secondary, dealing only with quite minor points. For instance, the German acquisition of territories in South-West Africa was a political act of high importance; though the British Government long delayed their recognition, no suggestion was ever made that this question should be referred to arbitration. Only after recognition had been given was arbitration used with regard to a subordinate dispute as to the frontier in the neighbourhood of Walfisch Bay, between the German and the British possessions. In the same way, after the British advance to the North, the war with Lobengula and the annexation of Mashonaland. grave difficulties arose with Portugal regarding the extent of Portuguese sovereignty. These differences were settled by the treaty of 1891: they were not submitted to arbitration. In this treaty there were, however, inserted clauses to the effect that difficulties in regard to its interpretation and application should be reserved for arbitration, and in accordance with this, we have two arbitrations with Portugal concerning the Manica and Barotse territories, just as there had been two other arbitrations with Portugal, both of which dealt with questions of quite subordinate importance.(&quot;)20. Among the frontier arbitrations one of the most celebrated and most instructive is the well-known conflict between Great Britain and Venezuela over the frontiers of British Guiana, and it is worth while putting the facts on record. The claim advanced by the Venezuelan Government, based, as it was, on early documents fixing the frontiers between the Dutch and the Spanish Colonies, was of such a nature that it was quite conceivable that an arbitral award based purely on these documents would have deprived Great Britain of a considerable portion of the Colony over which she had in fact exercised sovereignty for many years, and which was in the occupation of British settlers. This, then, was in effect not merely a&quot; frontier, but a territorial problem of a large scope. Just for this reason the British Government, notwith-standing the insistence of the United States, always refused to allow the case to go(lu) But as already pointed out, this mixed commission was not really an arbitral court: there can be little doubt that the reason why the British Government preferred this rather than strict arbitral procedure was that the frontier question in this case was of great importance, too important to lie submitted to arbitration. The boundary questions between Great Biitain and the United Slates, which are generally included among those which have been dealt with by arbitration, are seven in number. Of these there are only two in which complete arbitral procedure was successfully adopted, namely, the St. Oroix River, which was referred to a mixed commission of three, which issued their award on the 25th October, 171)8, mid the San Juan Water Boundary which, si mixed commission of four having disagreed, was referred to the German Emperor as arbitrator; his award was issued on the 21st October, 1X72. Three, the Bassamaquoddy Bay, the River and Lake Boundary, and the Alaska Boundary, were referred to mixed commissions, in the first two cases of two, in the last of six, all of which issued an award. The North-Eastern Boundary question was, after a mixed commission had failed, referred to the King of the Netherlands as arbitrator ; his award was not accepted and the dispute was finally settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1812. In tho same way, the Lake and Land Line Boundary, a mixed commission of two having failed to agree, was settled in the same treaty.(u) Among boundary disputes which were not, but might well have been, submitted to arbitration, may be mentioned the frontier dispute in liiOfi between Great Britain acting for Egypt and the Ottoman Empire regarding the frontier of the Peninsula of Sinai, The points at issue were to a large extent the interpre-tatipu of decrees issued by the Ottoman Government determining the frontiers of the Khedivato of Mgypt, butt.be British Government in this case preferred tho method, first of remonstrance, then of an ultimatum, supported by the movements of ships.
to arbitration in such a form that the award might conceivably have deprived them of this territory. They proposed to get over the difficulty by making out the instruc-tions to the arbitrator that fifty years actual oceupation\should be considered as giving full title. At first Mr. Olney, the Secretary of State at Washington, strongly opposed this suggestion; eventually, however, after much correspondence, he withdrew his objection, and in consequence, in the treaty of February 1897. by which the reference to the arbitrators was formulated, a clause was included providing that Adverse holding or prescription during a period of fifty years shall make a good title. The arbitrators may deem exclusive political control of a district, as well as actual settlement thereof, sufficient to constitute adverse holding or to make title by prescription.In this way Lord Salisbury was successful in that which he had throughout consist-tently maintained, that he could not consent to the risk of alienating, in consequence of an arbitral award, districts which had long been regarded as British possessions. The reasons he gives for his action are instructive: The claim of Venezuela is so far-reaching that it brings into question interests and rights which cannot possibly be disposed of by an unrestrictedarbitration.....It covers two-thirds of the Colony of British Guiana; itimpeaches titles which have not been in question for many generations.....The view of Her Majestv&apos;s Government is that where the matter in issue is of great importance and involves rights which belong to a considerable population and are deeply cherished by them, special precautions against any miscarriage of justice are required.21. For our purpose the essential thing is to note that it was not by arbitration but by diplomacy that the difference between the British and the American Govern-ments (which was much more serious than that with Venezuela itself) was settled, for the difference had been, not as to whether or not there should be arbitration, but as to the limits and the scope of the arbitration. Of course, it would be possible to criticise Lord Salisbury&apos;s attitude and to maintain that if. as is the case, inter-national law recognises no time limitations to claims and no right of prescription to occupy territory, this is a grave omission which should be rectified. But surely at the present time it would be impossible to agree on and impose a general rule with regard to this question, and every legal decision by a court must have in it some element of a general rule. We may eventually come to a state of things where such a general rule may be agreed on; at present all that can be hoped is that in an individual case a definite period can be arrived at, but this period must be one which quite clearly in no way constitutes a binding precedent, and for this reason it is better that it should be reached by agreement between the parties concerned and not be included in the questions referred to the arbitrator. (&quot;)22. In regard to boundary questions as well as to private claims, we seem then to get to a positive conclusion. Arbitration has established itself as having a very definite and positive value, but its application is strictly limited. It has not been applied in the past to the great territorial problems by which States have been divided and which in some cases have led to war; these are settled either by war or by diplomacy; in both cases the decision is incorporated in a treaty. Arbitration is used only in minor matters when difficulties arise in the application or interpretation of the treaty in fixing the boundaries.23. We can now pass on to the consideration of a few selected arbitral cases which, for different reasons, are of special interest or importance.(1.) Behring Sea Seal Fishery.24. This is of great interest, for in it an attempt was made to use the arbitral method for purposes to which it is not well adapted. The first duty of the arbitrators was to decide certain important legal questions; they had to give a ruling on the law; this having been clone, pecuniary claims of the private persons (Canadian fishermen) who had suffered by what was decided to be the illegal action of the Americans were referred to a separate arbitral commission. In addition, however, the arbitrators were asked to propose new regulations for the conduct of the fisheries in the future,Tho point may be not without importance with regard to such matters as the Argentine claims tu the Falkland Islands and the Persian claim to Bahrein[17155] c
it)which the two parties bound themselves in advance to accept. In accordance with this they drafted new regulations; these proved in practice to be unsatisfactory; they did not prevent the destruction of the seals continuing, and eventually they were superseded by a new agreement voluntarily arrived at by all the parties&apos;concerned, not only Canada and the United States, but also Russia and Japan. The illustration is an important one, for it shows, what might have been expected, that a court which is very suitable for determining a point of law is not equally capable of devising a scheme for future administration, for such a scheme will probably require technical knowledge and administrative experience which a judicial authority does not possess. And yet agreement on some such scheme may be an essential corollary to an arbitral decision on the law; it is not sufficient for the permanent settlement of a political dispute that the existing law should he clearly laid down, for often, as in this case, the maintenance of the law is from the practical point of view undesirable; it is necessary to draft a new law. Arbitration can do the one. it cannot always do the other, and, tor this reason, especially on the real questions of large interest by which nations are divided, arbitration alone cannot be depended upon to provide a permanent and satisfactory settlement. Arbitration, in fact, is one step towards a settlement; it clears the ground by eliminating doubts as to the legal position and as to questions of fact. But this is only one part of the process, for the permanent settlement requires not only a determination as to the law. but a means of changing the law.(2.) The Dogger Bank.25. On no occasion has the real value of the arbitral method been better shown than in connexion with the Dogger Bank incident. On the other hand, it is most misleading to suggest, as is often done, that &quot;the difficulty was settled and war averted by arbitration.&quot;&apos; This is the exact reverse of the truth; it might mure justly be said that the insistence of the British Government on an international enquiry made a peaceful settlement appreciably more difficult and might well have brought about a rupture. Briefly stated the facts are as follows. The Russian Goveru-inent, as soon as they heard of the incident, hastened to offer their formal regret and full reparation for the injury done. For a moment it seemed as though they considered this would be sufficient. The British Government, however, insisted that in addition it was indispensable that a searching enquiry should be instituted in order to fix the responsibility and assign the blame: after this enquiry had taken place the Russians themselves must punish the officers who were found responsible and culpable. Lord Lansdowne also suggested that such an enquiry, which ought to be of an international character, could most conveniently, be entrusted to The Hague Court. The real difficulty was in getting the Russians to accept such an enquiry. There was some reluctance to allow the conduct of Russian officers to be adjudicated on in this manner. It was undoubtedly due to the influence of France, who, for political reasons, was most anxious to avoid a war between England and Russia, that the Tsar accepted the proposal. But for this, the Russians might well have stood out on the point of honour and a war might have broken out, the immediate occasion for which would have been the difference as to whether the Arbitral Court should be empowered not only to enquire into the facts but also to assign responsibility and blame.(&apos;3)26. The real interest of this case is that it affords an important precedent on the vexed conception of &quot; honour.&quot; The Russian Government eventually consented to submit to judgment and possible censure the action of their highest naval officers. Let us compare this with what happened in regard to a similar proposal made respecting the frontier conflict between a Russian detachment and Afghans at Penjdeh in 18S5. This incident, as will be remembered, threatened to bring about war; eventually accommodation was reached, it being agreed that the main subject of dispute, the delimitation of the frontiers, should be referred to a mixed commission of two. It seemed desirable, however, in view of the strong feelings which had been aroused, that the actual responsibility for the alleged offensive action of the Russians should be subjected to enquiry, and on the 24th April Lord Granville wrote to M. de Staal :-&quot; If the Russian Government believe that  the natural inclination which both Governments must feel to place confidence in the statements of their(1S) Tito award of the court contains points of particular interest, for they appear with great discretion to have subordinated the strict record as to the facts to political expediency. (See article by M. de Taube, L&apos;Incident dtt Dogger-Bank in I.e Monde Slave, June 1927.)
[17155](,&quot;) See bolow, paragraph -17.respective officers creates an unavoidable obstacle to coming to a just decision, they would be prepared, in their anxiety for the preservation of friendly relations, to meet the difficulty by referring to the judgment of the head of a friendly State the question, whether the agreement of the 16th March was or was not departed from either by the Russians or the Afghans, and to. decide how the incident can be closed in a manner consistent with the honour of Great Britain and Russia.&quot;The proposal was not welcomed by the Russian Government: the Emperor &quot; attached such importance to the point of military honour that he did not think any question would be admitted as to the conduct of the Russian military commanders; even supposing the principle of an enquiry were admissible, there seemed no one to whom the decision could he entrusted except the Emperor of Germany, who certainly would not consent to undertake the task.&quot; The British Government maintained their view, and intimated that they would be willing to accept the German Emperor as arbitrator, and they believed that it would be difficult for him to refuse if asked by the two Governments. The proposal.however, seems ultimately to have been dropped and no actual arbitration took place.27. 1904 shows, then, a great advance over 1885. A further stage is reached when in 1908 the French and German Governments referred to an arbitral enquiry the very serious collision which had taken place at Casablanca in Morocco between a German consular agent and the French military commander. It was an occasion on which both sides might, and probably under other circumstances would, have appealed to the point of honour. Fortunately, the incident occurred at a time when the relations between the two countries were for the moment comparatively friendly, and when. also, in consequence of the grave situation in Eastern Europe, both Governments wished to keep themselves free to exercise a moderating influence in the controversy which had arisen between Russia and Austria over the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The two Governments therefore agreed to submit all the facts to an impartial court of enquiry, which should have the right of apportioning blame and responsibility, and they mutually agreed, before the enquiry took place, each to express regret for any matter in which its officials had been to blame. It would be very difficult in the future for any Government, with these precedents before it, to refuse arbitration merely on the point of honour.(&quot;)(3.) The &quot; Alabama &quot; Claims.28. Among the earlier cases that of the&quot; Alabama &quot; claims is still of outstanding interest and importance, not only on account of the public interest it aroused at the time and the great stakes involved, but also because of the light which it throws on the nature, the value and the limitations of the arbitral procedure, as the following brief account will show.29. The grievances of the United States against the British Government were first, that they had hastily, prematurely and in a spirit of hostility, recognised the Southern States as belligerents at sea. It was this which beyond all else was the cause of the great animosity felt in America. Secondly, they charged the British Government with grave negiect in permitting the &quot; Alabama &apos;* and other cruisers to be fitted out and despatched from British ports, and, in consequence, claimed pecuniary compensation for the loss and damage caused by the action of these cruisers. The compensation was divided into two heads: (a) That due to the private owners of ships which had been seized or sunk illegally; (b) what were called the indirect claims, the damage done to the United States as a nation owing to the consequent prolongation of the war, the naval operations necessary for defence against these cruisers, and the loss caused by the injury clone in a general way to American commerce. From the beginning the American Government demanded that the whole case, including all these different points, should be submitted to arbitration.30. In the first stage Lord Russell peremptorily refused arbitration on any of these counts : &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government are the sole guardians of their own honour. They cannot admit that they may have acted with bad faith in maintaining the
neutrality which they profess.....   They must therefore decline either tomake reparation and compensation for the captures made by the *&apos; Alabama &quot; or to refer the question to any foreign State.&quot;(&quot;)In this he clearly went too far. and the position he took up could not be maintained. As Air. Adams pointed out in reply, what in effect he asserted was &quot; that a neutral Power is the sole judge of the degree to which it has done its duty under a code of its own making.&quot; that it was the only judge of its own actions, and that there &quot;was no international law protecting the rights of neutrals. If this principle were generally adopted, then, in any future war, neutral ports would become the centres from which the most effective and dangerous enterprises against the commerce of belligerents might be contrived, fitted out and executed, lie clearly intimated that if this was to be the law, then, on any future occasion in which Great Britain was at war, the whole enterprise of the most adventurous and least scrupulous portion of American citizens would be attracted by the great field of activity open to them, with results which would undoubtedly be disastrous to British commerce. Public opinion in America was openly looking forward to the time when a war would break out between Great Britain and Russia; they would then have an opportunity for reprisals.31. Public opinion in this country was in consequence seriously alarmed: it was seen that Lord Russell had allowed himself to put forward a doctrine which might be disastrous to this country if adopted elsewhere. Moreover, the position he assumed was quite inconsistent with our action during the French wars, when we had brought claims for unneutral action against America, which had been submitted to arbitration and allowed.32. In consequence, as soon as Lord Russell left ollice, the attitude of the British Government changed, and they intimated that they were willing to come to an agreement with regard to the private pecuniary claims against the &quot; Alabama &quot; (Jc, either by means of a commission, or even arbitration.   As Lord Stanley said : &quot; I have never concealed my opinion that the American claimants, or some of them at least, were very likely to make out their case and get their money. To us the money part of the affair is inappreciably small.&quot;On the other hand, he and his successors, Lord Clarendon and Lord Granville, continued their refusal to submit the whole case to arbitration, as the Americans required. In particular, they maintained their position that the recognition of the Southern States as belligerents at sea was a purely political act, the expediency and justice of which could not be submitted to any court, and they also refused to consider the indirect claims. We get then the stage at which the British Government came round to the position that they were willing to accept partial arbitration; the Americans still demanded unlimited arbitration.33. Another difficulty, however, arose. If there were to be arbitration on the limited claims, this would involve a decision of the court as to the law governing the rights of neutrals. The British Government still maintained that their obliga-tions were limited to carrying out loyally and completely the Foreign Enlistment Act, which was the law of the land at the time when these events took place. The Americans, in effect, maintained that this was not sufficient; in a matter of this kind international law superseded municipal law, and the court must decide what the international law was; that is, there would be entrusted to it what was in fact a very far-going legislative function.34. This difficulty was eventually got over in a very instructive manner. The British Government, recognising that the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1821 was defective, altered their own law and brought in a new Foreign Enlistment Act in 1870. By doing this, they recognised in principle the justice of the American contention that the earlier Act was insufficient; they then proceeded further, and, in agreement with the American Government, laid down the three celebrated &quot; Washington Rules,&quot; which the two nations agreed should henceforward, as between themselves, be the law, and the adoption of which they agreed also to recommend to all other States. More than this, the British Government agreed that these rules, though they had not been in force at the time, should be the rules which the proposed court of arbitration should adopt for the purposes of its decision. In this way the fundamental legal point was not left to the decision of the court, hut was agreed&quot;Official Correspondence on the Claims of the United States in respect, to the 1 Alabama,&apos;&quot; p. 117.
upon directly by diplomatic discussion. Further, the American Government tacitly dropped the point about the recognition of the Southern States, and though in presenting their case they used it as evidence of the hostile attitude of the British Government and nation, it was not referred to the arbitrator and no decision on it was asked for. Lastly (on this point there was a good deal of misunderstanding, which need not detain us here), the indirect claims were in effect withdrawn.35. These points having been all agreed, the case was eventually referred to arbitration, but the case as referred was very different from that which the Americans bad first put forward, and all that the arbitrators had to do was to decide whether the British Government had shown duej diligence in carrying out the Foreign Enlistment Act and the agreed rules, and, secondly, if there had been neglect, to determine the amount of compensation which should be paid. From this it emerges that the really important points, the differences which had at first been a real danger to peace, were settled, not by arbitration, but by agreement, and from the political point of view the principal document is not the decision of the arbitrators, but the com/iron/is or agreement in which the reference to the arbitrators was embodied.3(5. But this statement applies not.only to this particular arbitration, but is of general truth. The importance of it cannot be overestimated. After it has been agreed to refer some particular subject to arbitration, there then follow, the negotia-tions for drafting the reference. Until these negotiations, which are themselves of a diplomatic character, have been completed, arbitration cannot take place. This machinery provides a guarantee that when a country such as Great Britain consents to arbitration, it will not find itself in the unsatisfactory position of undertaking to carry out an award the scope and nature of which is ill-defined; there will lie a precise definition as to the points, whether of law or of fact, or of proposals for the future, on which the decision of the arbitrators is requested. Every outstanding case in the past shows the importance which the British Government have attached to this, and the real controversy which has arisen has generally been, not as to whether or not there shall be arbitration, but as to the limitations in the reference.37. But if there were compulsory arbitration, surely the situation would be completely changed, for it is the essence of compulsory, as distinguished from voluntary, arbitration that if a previous arrangement has not been arrived at, the duties of the arbitrators shall be extended to drafting what is called the compromis. if, for instance, in the &quot;Alabama&quot;&apos; case, compulsory arbitration had been in existence, then it would have been open to the United States to force Great Britain into arbitration at an early stage of the controversy, and if no agreement was reached between the two countries as to the terms of the com prom is, this would have had to be settled by the arbitrators themselves. The British Government would therefore have been forced, if the arbitrators had so decided, to submit to their judgment just those points which they insisted throughout could not be submitted to arbitration. In the same way, under a system of compulsory arbitration, the requirement of the British Government in the Venezuelan case, that fifty years&apos; adverse possession should be construed as giving a full title, would not have been agreed on beforehand by the parties, but would have been left to the determination of the court, and it is conceivable, though perhaps not probable, that the court might have disallowed the contention and have awarded to Venezuela districts which had for two generations been in the occupation of British settlers and under the de facto administration of the British Crown. This is not the place to discuss whether such a change would be desirable; all that is necessary is to point out that for these reasons compulsory arbitration would in reality be quite different in character from the present existing system of voluntary arbitration. It is doubtless a recognition of this which influenced the American Senate when in 1904 they determined that each recourse to arbitration, including, as it did, a treaty determining the points as to which a decision was required, must be separately and expressly approved by them.38. ft will be objected that the essential thing is that questions of this kind should be governed by a known and ascertained law, and should cease to be the field for the wayward will of individual Governments. The only way of ensuring peace is that, so far as possible, international relations should be subject to laws which all know and all are obliged to obey. This is true enough, and this is what all desire, but the recognition of it must not obscure the great importance of the question as to how the law is to be made. Tn broad outline there are two methods of legislation: the first is the building up of a system of law based on the writings of approved legalists applied and interpreted by a court; a judgment of the court becomes a precedent which will bind its successors, and has therefore legislative force.   But
under this system the States who are the parties concerned would themselves have no part in the work of legislation; they would be bound by laws which they had not themselves framed. The other system is that law is made by treaties between States, either special or general. Now, if we consider the great diversity of States, the differences of custom and tradition between Christianity, islam and the Eastern races, the difference of conditions between a long civilised and settled country in Europe inhabited by people of one race, language and religion, and partially inhabited colonial possessions, often with ill-defined boundaries, in which different races, civilised and uncivilised, white and black, yellow and brown, live side by side, it is easy to see that rules of law arising out of general principles made by learned jurisconsults and judges in their effort after uniformity may really produce a system which cannot properly be applied to territories of every kind. It is the consciousness of this which appears lo be the basis of the objection made to any form of compulsory arbitration by successive British Governments. They have had to deal not only with Great Britain, but with South Africa, the Malay States, the Colony of Hong Kong, with Australia and the Samoa Islands and New Guinea, and they may well shrink from pledging themselves to an unlimited undertaking to submit to arbitration each particular case, knowing that the decision on it may imply principles which will afterwards be applied to very different eases.39. It is for this reason that, although they have been parties to a larger number of arbitrations than any other country, excepting, perhaps, the United States, they none the less have shown such scrupulous care as to the points which should be submitted to arbitration and have in all doubtful cases preferred the diplomatic method, and even when arbitration has been agreed on, have used diplomacy to govern and control the arbitration. At the same time, the record shows clearly enough that the care and caution which they have exercised has not sprung from a reckless spirit of aggression and is not evidence of a preference for a decision by war.Part II. The Avoidance of War.40. If the preceding considerations are correct, arbitration has in the past often played a useful part in the settlement of disputes; it has become an indispensable instrument in international machinery and, in the future, it will certainly be more frequently used, while the procedure will be regulated and stereotyped. But, on the other hand, it would be easy to exaggerate its importance in the avoidance of war. It lias generally been used in matters of minor or secondary importance and, even where it has been most successful, investigation seems to show that first of all a definite decision has been made by the two States in controversy that it is for their common advantage that a peaceful settlement should be arrived at. This is essential. When this condition has been obtained, negotiations are pursued in a more favourable atmosphere; it is found possible by the ordinary methods of diplomacy, sometimes with the mediatory efforts of a third Power, to settle most of the points in dispute by agreement and negotiation. There will, however, from time to time emerge definite and clear issues, either of fact or of law, on which further assistance is required.  These, and these alone, are submitted to arbitration.41. Any investigation will, however, be misleading which is confined to those episodes in which arbitration has been used. Working on such narrow li&quot;.es we cannot form a just appreciation of the efforts made in the past by the British and other Governments to arrive at a pacific settlement of disputes. We must include in our survey international controversies which have been peaceably settled without arbitration and also those in which war has resulted. A complete survey of this larger question is, of course, impossible within the limits of this memorandum; it would involve nothing less than a consideration of the whole history of the last hundred years. It may be useful, however, to call attention to a few selected cases which present points of special interest.(1.) The Caroline Islands.42. Perhaps the most successful instance of the avoidance of war by a timely appeal to arbitration is to be found where we should least have exacted it. In 1885 Prince Bismarck proposed that the controversy between Germany and Spain with regard to the Caroline Islands, which threatened. *to involve the two countries in war, should be settled by the arbitration of the Pope.   His reason for doing so
(2.) Cuba and the United States.43. In the above ease the offer of arbitration afforded a method of dignified retreat: we have another occasion when it might with advantage have been used, but was not. with a similar object the long-standing controversy between Spain and the I niteil States regarding Cuba. In 189S the situation had arisen in which it became obvious that the United States, who were less conciliatory than the Germans because their vital interests were more closely affected, would insist on their demands for the autonomy, if not the independence, of Cuba, and what amounted practically to an ultimatum was presented at Madrid by General Wood ford. The Spanish Govern-ment itself then approached the Powers unofficially with a request that &quot; they might offer their advice to Spain and the United States to arrange the conflict by accepting an arbitrator.&quot; The Powers did not. however, act on this suggestion, and confined themselves to presenting collective notes at Washington and Madrid and expressing their hope that peace might be maintained and order restored in Cuba. At the instance of the European Powers, apparently Austria and Germany, the Pope then caused enquiries to be made at Madrid whether they would accept his arbitration; it seems to have been understood that the acceptance of the offer would have been on the basis that this would afford the Spanish Government an honourable method of acquiescing in recognition of Cuban independence: the answer of the Spanish Government was unfavourable: they now seem to have held that the loss of Cuba, even as the result of an arbitral award, would have been looked upon as a humiliation and would inevitably have led to revolution; to this they preferred war, which, in consequence of the strong popular feeling in America, increased by the sinking of the &quot;&apos; Maine,&quot; had. in fact, become almost inevitable. Of course, the facts connected with the sinking of the Maine &quot; could have been referred separately to an inter-national arbitral enquiry, and this would have been much preferable to the separate American and Spanish investigations which took place. Even had this been done, it would have left the fundamental issues untouched.(3.) The Balkan War.44. There is one outstanding case in which an unnecessary and disastrous war might and should have been avoided by the method of arbitration the second Balkan war of 1913. By the Treaty of &quot;Alliance between Bulgaria and Serbia, it iiad been definitely provided that the Tsar should be asked to act as supreme arbitrator in regard to the partition of territories which might be conquered from Tin key, and the future frontier between the two States. None the less, war broke out on&apos; this territorial question, the Bulgarians having resorted to violence without waiting for his decision. It is of interest to note that at an earlier period a suggestion had been made that the Bulgarian and Serbian spheres in Macedonia should be decided by a neutral and impartial commission.   In February 1907was that, though ho hold that Germany had a good case, and if her claim to the islands was refused there was ample justification for war, none the less he decided that the acquisition of the islands was not worth a war. Spain would not and could not give way, for surrender on her part would have involved the fall of the monarchy, and this would have been most unwelcome to Germany as to most other continental States. Bismarck, therefore, with great political skill, used the offer of arbitration as a dignified method of retreat, while at the same time, by suggesting the Pope as arbitrator, strengthening his position at home. He seems to have assumed that the Pope would decide for Spain, not necessarily on legal grounds. Spain agreed to accept the reference to the Pope, but on condition that he should act not as arbitrator but as mediator. The Spanish Government would not, in fact, put themselves into the position that they would be compelled to accept an adverse award. On these conditions the Pope, on the 22nd October, 1885, issued what he called proposals, not an award, and he speaks of himself not as an arbitrator but as a mediator. His decision was that the sovereignty of Spain over the Caroline Islands, which Germany disputed, should be affirmed, but he recommended that the Spanish Government should establish a regular administration in the islands and should grant to Germany full freedom of commerce, navigation, fishing and the right to establish a naval and coaling station and to make plantations in the islands. Thereby the dispute was amicably settled. The case is of great interest as showing both the value and the difficulties of arbitration.
M. Pashitch declared that &quot; the Serbian Government was so sure of the justice of their claim that they would be quite willing to abide by the decision of a scientific ethnographical commission which should draw the frontier line between Serbs and Bulgars according to language and traditions. The frontier would, of course, not be a very definite one, as the two nationalities, being closely akin, mixed on meeting as liquids do. but an impartial commission would be able to draw a line which would be practically equitable, and such a line Serbia would not hesitate to accept.&quot; Of course, at that time the proposal could not have been carried out. and no notice seems to have been taken of it. but how much blood and misery would have been spared if such an impartial delimitation could have been made either then or later! But nothing would be more misleading than to argue that, because arbitra-tion could well have been used to keep the peace between Serbia and Bulgaria, it could also have been applied to the first Balkan war between the allied States and Turkey, for. as will be pointed out later, this struggle turned on matters of vital and fundamental interest in regard to which no compromise acceptable to both parties could have been permanently successful, still less the award of a court which would almost certainly have checked the just national aspirations of the Christian States.(4.) Serb/a and Austria in 1914. &apos;45. It seems impossible to omit ali reference to the Tsar&apos;s suggestion in 1914 that the differences between Austria and Serbia should be submitted to The Hague Court, for these differences turned, as did those between the Balkan States and Turkey, on great national ambitions, which were inconsistent with the maintenance and, therefore, the vital interests of another State. It is possible that a court of enquiry might have put forward a judgment with regard to the responsibility of the Serbian nation and the complicity of the Serbian Government in the murder of the Archduke; it is even possible that they might have framed a judgment on the question whether Serbia had carried out the undertaking made to the Powers in 1909 not to do anything to prevent good relations with Austria, but no award on these points could have permanently removed the causes of friction, for they lay in the fact that the long-standing Serbian aspirations to union with Bosnia and Herzegovina, not to speak of Croatia, were irreconcilable with the interests, and we may say the very existence, of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.46. And this seems to lead to a recognition of the fact that from tune to time in international affairs there arise controversies so fundamental in their nature that submission to arbitration woidd at the best mean not the avoidance but the postpone-ment of war; quite possibly it might precipitate a war. These problems require special consideration, and to this we have a useful line of approach; it has become customary to insert in all general treaties of arbitration the proviso that the obligation to arbitrate does not apply to those cases where the honour and vital interests of the States are concerned, and in some cases there have been added to these exceptions &quot; domestic matters.&quot; The problem we have, then, to meet is, what sort of questions are included under these very vague words. In questions of this importance we must not be put off with a phrase; the suggestion has, indeed, often been made that the use of these expressions is merely a cynical device used by ambitious States to keep open their right of recourse to aggressive war for no reason except that they desire to do so.Honour.47. On the whole there seems, indeed, to be some justification for regarding the conception of &quot; honour &quot; with suspicion. We have already seen to what abuse it has lent itself in so small a matter as personal claims; the development we have traced from the Penjdeh to the Dogger Bank incident, and from that to the Casablanca arbitration, shows how, within the short space of twenty years, the interpretation of the conception has changed, and it seems not improbable that this development will continue. Honour in the past has been too frequently confused with prestige. It would perhaps be too much to hope that the conception of honour can be entirely eliminated from these discussions; there are and will probably always remain cases in which the honour of a nation in the real sense of the word is involved, as when a nation is bound to protect those who have incurred serious danger as allies and loyal supporters; Great Britain was. indeed, bound in honour not to surrender
the interests of the loyalists who had stood firm during the rebellion of the American colonies, and to secure for them the protection and compensation provided in the treaty of peace. Great Britain was bound in honour to the support of Belgium against the violation of her neutrality, because it was on this condition that the Belgians had reluctantly accepted the limitations of their full freedom of action proposed in the treaties of 1837. Apart from this, we may well keep in mind an observation attributed to Sir Stafford Northcote : (&quot;&apos;)National honour docs not consist in never admitting that one is in the wrong, but rather in seeking in all justice to recognise the rights of others as against one&apos;s own. and even to go further than strict justice, and in case of doubt to pronounce against oneself rather than for oneself.&quot;It might, indeed, be argued with much force that controversies in which &quot; honour,&quot; as apart from interest is concerned, are just for that reason specially suitable for submission to an impartial court.Domestic Affairs.48. The exception as to domestic affairs also need not detain us long, not, indeed, because of its unimportance, for there is no subject which in the future will probably create so much controversy and difficulty. If, as is to be expected, the Court of international Justice in carrying out its duties gradually builds up a system of international law, it is inevitable that some of the legal principles adopted and the decisions given will lead to a conflict between international and national law, and the claim will be made that international law shall take precedence of national legislation. The greatest clanger of this is in regard not only to questions of immigration, but also to the whole position of aliens. In regard to them it might easily involve scrutiny and censure of municipal law as applied to aliens, and quite probably in some countries lead to the condition that aliens would enjoy privileges and securities denied to natives. There have been occasions on which the British Government itself, as in its controversy with Brazil in 1861. put forward claims which, if allowed, would in fact have implied that the municipal law of another country should in its application to aliens be so modified as to be in accordance with English principles of jurisprudence and police administration. An arbitral award might equally well raise fundamental constitutional principles as to the freedom of the press, the right of association, points which in fact were among the issues raised by the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia in 1914. It is difficult to see how. if this controversy had been referred to arbitration, the court could have avoided giving an opinion as to the extent of the control which it was the duty of the Government to exercise over the press and associations. And then we have points such as criticism of the Foreign Enlistment Act, which we have seen would have been subjected to an arbitral decision had the original demands of the American Government been accepted. For the British Government such matters are of peculiar importance and difficulty, for the territories whose interests they represent are so varied, their internal conditions so different, that the acceptance of a general rule seems to be impossible. There may also be included under this heading the whole question of the relations of the Dominions to the British Government, which, by common consent, could not be submitted to an arbitral court. In this connexion we may refer to the difficulty which arose when in 1897 the point was raised whether the preference granted to British goods in Canada was inconsistent with the most-favoured-nation clause embodied in the Commercial Treaty with Germany. As was immediately recognised at the time, this was the sort of question which could not be submitted to arbitration.Vital Interests.49. The essential point, however, is that of vital interests. Is the conception valid and just ? What are the sort of points which in a reasonable interpretation would be included in it 1 Have such points, in fact, in the past been referred to arbitration, and, if not, have they been the cause of a war which otherwise could have been avoided ?(18) Quoted from Upradollo and Politis, vol. II, p. 905. I have not. been able to verify this quotation, and it is, therefore, retranslated from the French, but. the statement is too valuable to be omitted[17155] D
50. In this matter we are able to turn for guidance to the history of the United. States, for that country alone has laid dowu in unmistakable terms what it regards as the most essential of its vital interests. The Monroe doctrine is, as has of ten been pointed out, not a rule of law; it is the statement of a principle of policy which that great country has adopted in the past and proposes to maintain in the future. But we have to deal not only with the Monroe doctrine as originally expressed, but also with its later extensions and with similar but less clearly defined principles which had been adopted and carried out even before the Monroe doctrine was proclaimed. From the time when the Colonies first won their independence it rapidly became their determination, first, that the whole area lying between the Atlantic, the Mississipi and the Gulf of Mexico should be included within their political domain; later, this ambition was extended to the vast territory west of the Mississipi to the Pacific Ocean, and that it should be exclusively reserved to colonisation by American citizens. These ambitions were inconsistent with the established rights of other countries, especially of France, of Spain, and in the south-west of Mexico as the heir of Spain, and it was not improbable that they might be contested as regards at least the north-west, by the British Government. In consequence, during the first fifty years of the republic^ history, they were the cause of acute friction, which on one occasion passed on into war, and repeatedly led to the gravest diplomatic controversies. On no occasion throughout the whole of this story was arbitration exercised, though some of the matters at issue, e.g., the boundaries of Florida and of Louisiana, turning as they did on the interpretation of treaties, were apparently very suitable. On the whole the United States were very fortunate in the circum-stances; Spain was too weak. France too much occupied m Europe, at a later stage Mexico too ill-governed, to interpose any insuperable barrier, while the British Government always showed itself most accommodating and conciliatory. No one can doubt that had they met with more resolute opposition, no arbitral decision, no apprehension that technically they were acting as &quot; aggressors ** would have perturbed them from the pursuit of this great purpose. They had in mind a great constructive policy, and. if necessary, would at any time have been ready to devote to this the whole of their strength and resources. The real justification for their action is to be found not in the methods by which the territory was acquired, but in the use which, after success, they made of the territory. That which the historian of the future will record is that in these great territories they built up an orderly and effective system of government, and thereby added to the prosperity of the world.51. In this sphere they were very successful in their endeavours, and. starting from this success, they propounded principles of a wider extension covering the whole of the new world. Not only as under the Monroe doctrine was the soil of America not to be subject to colonisation by European States; they went further, and as President Grant said in 1870 : &apos;* No European Power can acquire by any means war, colonisation or annexation even when the annexed people demands it, any portion of American territory.&quot;In accordance with this principle, they committed themselves to the position that the Island of San Domingo might not, even by the express wish of the inhabitants, be reacquired by Spain, that the Island of Cuba should not be sold by Spain to France, that the Danish rights over St. Thomas should not by a friendly agreement be transferred to Germany, that British possessions in Central America and Guiana should not be extended,&quot; ami eventually, that the building of a canal across the isthmus should be exclusively reserved for&quot; American enterprise. Nowhere throughout all these controversies was there a place for arbitration. What good could arbitration have done? No arbitrator could have failed to find that according to all the principles of law, Denmark was fully qualified to cede, and Germany to acquire, the Island of St. Thomas. And how could any arbitrator have failed to recognise that Great Britain had full right to recognise the independence of the Republic of Texas and, having done so/to enter into an alliance with it? The question at issue was not one of law or of right or of justice; the contention of the United States was that such an alliance would be contrary to their vital interests and, therefore, must not take place. We may quote a distinguished American historian : &quot; A still further extension of the principle is the idea, now generally accepted, that no transfer of American territory from one European Power to
another ran henceforth he allowed a proposition that was set forth in the particular case of Cuba as earty as 1808. The United States permits the existence of foreign colonies in its neighbourhood, but will resist any changes in their alien ownership; for such changes would be in the nature of the colonisation which it forbids. We may feel sure that it would risk all the hazards of war rather than acquiesce in the sale of St. Thomas to Germany. This might seem to be pushing the doctrine pretty far: for it would limit tfie right of free transaction between two independent nations, one of them a world power. Nevertheless, it would not be unprecedented, and might be justified by the importance of the interests involved. The establishment of such a fortified coaling station within a short distance of the American coast would be some-thing which the United States would no more tolerate, so long as it was capable of effectual resistance, than England and France would agree to the transfer from Spain to Germany of the African fortress of Ceuta.&quot;(,r)What better illustration could wc have of what is meant by vital interests?52. In these matters they had a great advantage which has been denied to other countries The objects they wished to attain were of more importance to them than the denial of these objects to any other country; no other country, therefore, when placed before the real alternative, was willing to challenge this policy in war. The clear ami open enunciation of it was, under these circumstances, a great factor in the avoidance of war. There were, however, occasions on which an attempt-was made to extend the doctrine too far, as when President Grant declared that &quot; the time is not far distant when, in the natural course of events, the European political connexion with this continent will cease,&quot; or when Mr. Olney wrote that &quot; distance and 3,000 miles of intervening ocean make any permanent political union between a European and an American State unnatural and inexpedient.&quot; On this they found that they were opposed by interests as great and a will as inflexible as their own, the will of the people of Canada, supported by the British Government. It was a position which could not be maintained and from which they therefore withdrew; the attempt to include this doctrine among vital interests to which they might fairly claim the general assent of other countries failed.53. With this illustration before us we can now pass on to the consideration of other countries and their vital interests. In our own history we may find numerous illustrations of these permanent principles of policy which under no circumstances are we prepared to surrender as, for instance, the principle that the Low Countries shall not fall under the dominion of a great naval or military Power. Again, arising out of the obligation to maintain British rule in India, it has always been necessary to insist that the States on the northern frontier. Afghanistan. Tibet and Nepal, should not fall under the political influence or the military control of any other great Power in this case. Russia; similar is the principle that the naval and political control of the Persian Gulf should be preserved to the Government of India. These, like the Monroe doctrine, are long established, openly avowed, and just for this reason are, in practice, recognised by other countries. And other countries, too, have their vital interests, which they may justly ask that we should respect. For instance, France, that the north-west of Africa should be regarded as her sphere of interest, and that no other power, in addition to Spain, should be permitted to exercise political control, still less to establish settlements there. Or. again, the older policy of Prussia, as set out in the Treaty of Bjile, that Germany north of the Maine should be reserved for her, and that alien or hostile political interests should not be established there. Or, the Russian doctrine, that no other European State should be permitted to acquire political and military control over Constantinople, still less to annex that city and other territories adjacent to the Straits.54. Of course, things are not always so simple. There is often a real doubt as to what are vital interests; mistakes are made, the conception is pressed too far, and it. is necessary to withdraw, as we have seen the Americans had on one occasion to withdraw. Sometimes circumstances change so that what has appeared to be a vita&apos; interest ceases to be so. To this category belonged the doctrine of the closing of the Straits; in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris, this was pressed too far, and in 1871 we had to withdraw in consequence of Russian action. Later, when by the acquisition of Egypt wc had secured a firm position in the Levant, the question of the Straits no longer had the same predominant importance and -we became willing07) Coolidge: &quot;The United Slates as a World Power.&quot; p. 112. [17155] E
-JOto make it the subject ol negotiation and to surrender much which we had formerly declared to be essential. In the same way, the doctrine of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, which had so long guided our policy, was abandoned. Sometimes, on the other hand, it is only slowly, and after much tribulation, that the clearness of vision has been acquired which is necessary in order that a guiding principle of policy should be proclaimed and maintained.55. We may take two illustrations which from this point of view are of the highest importance, the history of the relations of Great Britain to Egypt and the history of South Africa. Looking back at the series of events which have taken place in either of these countries during the last two generations, we can now see&apos; that what in fact has been done has been to work out what we may call a great constructive policy. In the case of South Africa a satisfactory conclusion has been reached. In the case of Egypt we may fairly hope that a similar conclusion will soon be obtained. In the first case, the conclusion has been that the whole of South Africa up to the Zambesi (excluding the reserved native territories) has become a single political unit in which the two European races, English and Dutch, have full and complete legal equality, and, also, that while under the British flag and a member of the British Confederation of Nations, this political community enjoys the fullest rights of self-government and sovereignty. It would be difficult now to find anyone who would dispute the proposition that the conclusion arrived at is one singularly advantageous to the inhabitants of this new State, and also is one which does not militate against the general welfare of the world.56. In the case of Egypt, the conclusion which appears now to lie in sight is one which would secure to Egypt a full and complete independence, together with membership of the League of Nations, this independence being further assured by a permanent Treaty of Alliance with the British Empire, a treaty which would also secure to the British Empire certain special privileges and rights which, owing to the geographical position of Egypt and its proximity to the Suez Canal, are of vital interest not only to Great Britain, but to the Empire of India and to the Dominions of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. It can be foreseen that the final settlement, which all hope for, will provide for the Sudan that strong and secure Government which, in view of its very wide extent and the character of its inhabitants, would certainly be impossible except by the help of a powerful and wealthy European State. Such a settlement would certainly also include ample guarantees to Egypt for the use of the waters of the Nile.57. In both these cases, then, we can look at the end of the story; in both we find a remarkable illustration of constructive political work. If, however, we turn back and enquire how these desirable results have been brought about, we see a long-series of troubles, insurrections, civil war and formal war. We have complex diplomatic discussions with the Colonies and States whose interests were involved, and acute controversies with all other interested Powers, which have more than once brought us to the very verge of war. In not a single case throughout the whole of this history has the method of arbitration been resorted to; there was no arbitration of the differences which arose between the British Government, the Orange Free State and the South African Republic when they were independent States; there was no arbitration of our differences with the Ottoman Empire in consequence of the British occupation of Egypt; there was no arbitration with regard to the differences not only with France, but with other European Powers, on the financial settlement in Egypt; above all, there was no arbitration regarding the acute differences between Great Britain and Egypt on the one side, and France on the other, at the time of the Fashoda incident. In every case the British Government pursued its own course. It attempted, so far as was possible, to come to an amicable agreement on the matters which from time to time were under discussion, but it always preferred to risk a breakdown of the negotiations rather than to surrender those points which at the particular moment seemed vital for the continuance of the task it had taken upon itself.58. And may we not go further than this, and suggest that if there had been in those days a formal obligation to resort to arbitration when other means of coming to an amicable settlement had failed, the constructive work of the British Govern-raent would almost certainly have been frustrated. Flow greatly would the difficulties have been increased had Great Britain been under an obligation to submit to arbitration with the Ottoman Empire their action in landing troops in Egypt and maintaining an army of occupation there, or to submit the Anglo-Egyptian title to the Sudan to the judgment of a court.
59. As it was here, so elsewhere. If in past years the doctrine of compulsory arbitration in all international disputes had prevailed and been enforced, and if the aggressor had always been held in check, then the whole political development of the continent of Europe would have been held up, and the process by which now it has become divided between independent national States would have been frustrated. The great wars of the last century were not, as seems often to be suggested, fought oil points of legal right or mere conflict of honour, which could have been arranged by a mediator or an arbitrator. The wars by which the union of Germany and of Italy were established, and by which, after so long a delay, the Balkans were freed from Turkish Government, were in each case deliberately planned and carried out with a clearly defined object, which, looking back, we surely must acknowledge, was legitimate. What use is it now to enquire whether in 1855). in 1866, in 1912, France and the Kingdom of Piedmont, Prussia, the Balkan States, were technically the aggressors, and how could any arbitration have dealt with the issues which were decided by these conflicts? Gould we now wish that Russia should still rule in Warsaw and in 1 lelsingfors, that the Austrians should still be in Milan and in Venice, that Belgrade. Sofia and Bucharest should still be under the Government of the Sublime Porte, or that the unification of Germany and of Italy should not have taken place, and that the Yugoslav nation should still be divided between the sovereignty of three other States? In each of these cases the true question we have to ask, if we presume to weigh in the balance the actions of other States, is whether, when they have obtained their desires they have shown themselves capable of contributing more than did the system which has been displaced, to the general welfare of the world.00. Vital interests are then a real thing. They cannot with impunity be ignored, and a conflict in which they are involved cannot always be settled by methods suitable to other controversies: even as regards them it may. indeed, often be possible to do much by conciliation and mediation: for this ample provision is made in the Covenant of the League of Nations as it now stands. But if this fails, then arbitra-tion. compulsorily imposed, involving as it decs a final and definite decision from which there is no appeal, might well do more harm than good. Far better leave the problem unsettled, hoping that, as has often happened in the past, time and delay may help to bring a solution. Nor in these matters is it sufficient simply to condemn the aggressor, for it may well be that in the success of the aggressor lies the hope for the future. For over fifty years the British Government, generally in association with Austria, resolutely maintained the integrity of the Ottoman Empire a policy which was essentially non-aggressive and calculated to preserve peace. But there are few now who looking back would not recognise that it would have been better for the world at large had they been willing to co-operate, with other States in the gradual dissolution of the Empire, even though a policy of tnis kind might justly have been characterised as aggressive.61. Permanent peace cannot be secured merely by a paper outlawing of war, nor by the adoption of compulsory arbitration, nor by merely condemning the aggressor. The only way of stopping war is to remove the causes of it. Civil war is now everywhere regarded as illegal, but this does not and will not prevent civil war where there is misgovernment. And so in international affairs, war can only be per-manently avoided when a political system has been established under which the different nations, each feeling that its reasonable demands are secured, respects the reasonable demands of others. The real hope for the future lies in the fact that to a very large extent this necessary condition has been secured. We do not always recognise how great an advance has been made in this direction by the. events of recent years and, above all, by the Great War and its results. On the continent of Europe, even if the territorial settlement is not in every detail fully satisfactory, there are at least not left any of the great outstanding problems which have been the cause of war in the past. There may be, there are, in some places conditions which are not generally acceptable, but they may be regarded rather from the point of \icw of local adjustments of frontiers which, as we. have seen, can be dealt with by diplcuacy, by mediation, or even by arbitration, and do not involve fundamental territorial problems. And as it is in Europe, so to a large extent it is elsewhere. One of the greatest achievements of the 19th century is that the whole soil of Africa has been partitioned between the European States and that this has been done entirely by peaceful negotiation. In not a single case has this great work led to war between any two European Powers. The long and often acrimonious discussions which took place about the Niger, Zanzibar, Equatorial Africa were all part of the everyday
work of the diplomatists, and they showed themselves equal to the task ; the problems which remain for the future seem, if not entirely, at any rate to a very large extent, to be within the scope of diplomatic action, reinforced and strengthened as it now is by the establishment of the League of Nations and the new spirit which prevails. Before 1914, on the continent of Europe every important diplomatic discussion was conducted with the clear recognition that failure to achieve an agreement would be inevitably and at once followed by war. Though the nations tried to avoid it, war was regarded as a normal method of settling disputes which, even if it might be avoided on one occasion, would inevitably occur on some other. To a large extent, even on the continent of Europe, it looks as though there is arising an attitude more similar to that which, as we have seen, has long prevailed on the continent of America. Under these changed circumstances arbitration will doubtless be more frequently vised than in the past, but it does not follow that it would be wise to impose it universally.62. But. in dealing with such outstanding questions as there still may be here ami elsewhere, the history of the past should remind us that peace cannot be kept merely by an indolent acquiescence in the status quo. When injustice is found to exist, then it must be removed. If it is to do its work, the League of Nations must be not merely passive and repressive: it must show power of active remedy and con-struction. In this healing process wc may assume that the British Government will take an active part, just as it may fairly be maintained that it is largely due to their efforts that the new system and the new spirit are due..1.
