(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S fiOVSRWMECT?)SECRET. COPY HO. qOCP.  51 (20).-------------- CABINET.INDIAN   AFFAIRS. ^.9*&apos;?--VZ-l&apos;--1.0. ^ecrear7 ,9- SyQte for I?-.dia.My colleagues my care to read the enclosed extract, from a letter from a Member of my Council a3 throwing some light on the present temper of important elements in Indian opinion0BIRK3NHEAD,India Office, S,W*1* 16th February, 1928.Extract from a letter from S,N, Mallik, Esq,, CSI/EB, to Sir Arthur Hlrtzel, dated 25th January. 1023.,In one sense., we are so glad that w-3 left London just in ti-me to escape the dreadful weather but In another sen3S I am sincerely sorry for having come here at this time, with the Royal Commission following vast behind us.     The whole country has gone mad and no dispassionate talk or argument is possible.      I and Lord Sinha have been described to be the spies of Lord Birkenhead and it has been said that our expenses for coining home have been paid by the India Office! I The difficult:,1 is that one cannot put In all his people in the lunatic Asylum.The other day I was called upon to preside over the Founders&apos; Day Ceremony of my own (Presidency) College. A boycott was also arranged there and the &quot;Eengaj.ee&quot; wrote the accompanying comment upon it (Marked (A)).     Anonymous letters were sent to me to say that I was a &quot;traitor&quot; and-1-
I Kas not wanted there.      On the morning of the day, these red leaflets wore published all over the town (Marked (B)). All the same we had the ceremony, but the young man looked daggers at me.     Since then the TTincipai la being abused in the papers for having selected a &quot;traitor&quot; to be the Chief Guest of the day.It is amazing to find on what flimsy grounds m3n like Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Sir Sivaswamy Ayar are calling for the boycott.     All arrangements are being made for it for the 3rd February when the Coinmidsion will arrive at Bombay.      I think it will be a huge and a very nice joke if the Commission arrives at Bombay on the 2nd February by quickening the speed of tUsir steamer a bit II read in the papers hero that our colleague Dr. Faranjpye has resigned.     I don&apos;t know; If this is true. I hope, not.I intend to go to Delhi to see the Viceroy on the 10th February.     While there I shall take the opportunity of meeting Sir John Simon and Lord Burnham whom I personally know.     After I return from Delhi, my days here Kill be numbered.(A)WIT,   PEPPER AMI&apos;) SALT. The invitation to Mr. S.N, Mallik to preside at the Presidency College Founders&apos; Day to-day seems to be a closely calculated step.     The design is to honour an ex-student and an ex-member of the Governing Bod7 who has risen to be the most vocal of Birkenhoad1s counsellors. The wonder is, however,  what he can possibly have to say to young students at the Presidency College;   he has talked too much elsewhere already.     But great men have a weakness for repetition;   and Jflr.  Mollik, were he to indulge it,
would only be in excellent company.     Such hopefuls as are looking forward to Government service would no doubt like to hear Mr* Mallik discourse sweetly on the &quot;providential connection&quot; of India with England:   re--iteration would only enrich so happy a theme.     Formal politics being taboo, he might perhaps find it pleasing to hint -but only hint - at the &quot;wisdom&quot; of the Simon Seven, and the duty of students on the coming Hartal day.     He might demonstrate,  too, the correct physical and spiritual attitude towards royalty and Royal Commissions *     On such subjects,  certainly, he would &quot;talk far above singing&quot;. And were he to be invited to one of our useful missionary colleges, how eloquently could he not repeat his Caxton Hall speech on the indebtedness of Bengal to Christianity. A man so ingeniously speculative should not certainly be gravelled for want of matter.(3)You are going to receive &quot;A MES3SKGSR OF 3IRXSNHEAB&quot; United India is preparing for boycott,Vfould you lat: behind?
