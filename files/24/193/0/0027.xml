. this Document,, is..the property of His britannic Ha.1 eaty1 s Government,CABI1TET.Secret3RICA1T CAPITAL.Memorandum by^ the Minister of Transport.I was recently informed &quot;by the Chairman of the central electricity Board. Sir Andrew Duncan, that he has reason to know that American financiers were interesting themselves in the acquisition of electrical undertakings in this country, and various statements to this effect have appeared in the press.and Counties Trust,, Limited, is the medium through which purchases are &quot;being made, and has already acquired the control of the East Anglian Electricity Supply Company,   the \7essex Electricity Company, the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Electricity Company, ar.d Ednivndson&apos;s Electricity Corporation. LimitecL     Edmund sen&apos; 3 is the direct owner of certain statutory undertakings and through holding interests controls many others.      The Trust has also,  it is understood, acquired one or two small undertakings and is in process of acquiring others, mainly in the area covered by the South-East England Electricity Scheme, but has it in contemplation to extend its activities into other areas3      Tor example,  a proposal is afoot for the construction of a super-power station on Southampton Water.The Trust has further, according to Sir Andrew Duncan&apos;s information, purchased a considerable, but not a controlling interest,  in the Horth Metropolitan Electric power Supply Company,  and a working arrangement has been made with that Company for ten years under which it will manage the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire Company, which holds Parliamentary powers in respect of a large and important area.In addition to these activities it is reportedIt appears that a Trust known as the Greater London
190 1   that the General Electric Company of New York ha3 taken over the Vicker3 holding in the L&apos;etropolItan-(/icksr3 Electrical Company.This incursion of American capital into one of our prinsipal public utilities has already attracted tho attention of municipal interests nnd the Council of the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Associations has expressed concern at the prospect &quot;that in a few yearn time the stoto of affairs in electric supply will consist of one huge combine covering the country south of a line drawn from the wash to the Bristol Channel, embracing the existing large power companies in this area and all existing private companies.I forsee the possibility that It may be made a point of political criticism that electrical development over a large area of the country, so far as it is not in municipal hancl3, has passed to a financial trust which is under foreign control.Attention would no doubt bo drawn In this connection to the fact that the Treasury may guarantee the payment of the interest and principal of any loan raised by the Central Electricity Board up to an amount of  33-^ millions.Representations may also be made to the effect that our manufacturing interests may suffer by the diversion of orders abroad where the interests of the Trust would be so served, and there is likely to be apprehension and dislike felt In the engineering profession at the prospect of the introduction of American engineers into important positions. These fears will not bo readily allayed by disclaimers on the part of the Trust,
I recognise of course that any suggestion that heavy American investment in one of our great public utilities 3hould be discourarrod would raise at once &quot;both practical and political issues of a far-reaching kind, &quot;but I feel it my duty to apprise the Cabinet or the situation,I have already discussed the matter with the President of the Bo:.rd of Tr&apos;?de and concur in the suggestion which I understand he will make to the Cabinet that the matter should be referred for examination to the Committee of Civil Research,    If that suggestion commends itself, it would, I think, be well to add to the Committe for this purpose, Lord v/cir, who presided over the Committee on whose Report the Electricity Supnly Act of 192 3 was based, r^nd Sir Andrew Duncan himself.I may add that some of tho statutory companies to which reference Is m?de in this memorandum, rre seeking to extond their existing powers in the present Session ofParliament .Ministry of Transport,Whit shall Gardens, S .*/. 1. 9th March, 1920.(intdc) W.A.
