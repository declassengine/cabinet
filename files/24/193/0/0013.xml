Mot e py the^Chance11 or - of   he^Ekchcauer.Some statements hare appeared in the Baily Hail which inaccurately disclose a portion of certain Government plans.     It is a common practice with journalists to float a ballon d&apos;essai of this description and then by cross-questioning persons upon its accuracy to unravel the whole matter.      It is important that everyone who has become party to the proposals should realise that the strictest secrecy should still be maintained,  even though a good deal of guesswork may appear in the Press.I understand that the papers on this subject have been shewn to a certain number of the Parliamentary Private Secretaries, and it is evident that the number of persons who are informed is considerable,,      It is therefore asked that Ministers will bring this caution to the notice of those concerned.W.S.C.Treasury Chambers,  S.-V.I, 28th February, 1928.
