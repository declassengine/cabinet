v^RET. P.89(28)Copy No._^1_ICABINET. TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum by tho president of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a record of the meeting of my Advisory Council held in March.Taking industry as a rholo, both the Federation of 3ritish Industries and the Association of Chambers of Commerce report evidence of a slow but steady improvement.    This is confirmed by exhibitors at the British Industries Fair.    A record number of buyers attended the Fair, and exhibitors both in London and Birmingham expressed satisfaction at the orders placed.In connection with the Fair, my colleagues  /ill have noticed f that Canada, New Zealand and South Africa have all concurred in the proposal that the publicity grant should be made by the Empire marketing 3oard.      I cannot help expressing again my great regret that a unique opportunity has been lost of reconciling British manufacturers to the work and expenditure of the Board.Turning to individual industries, the coal situation remainsunsatisfactory.    Prices are vreak, and have shown a tendency to fall still further.      The Scottish cartel scheme is now inoperation, the first to be put in force.    The object of thescheme is to limit output in selected collieries, and to compensate these collieries by a   levy on all collieries vhichare parties to the scheme.The larger scheme covering the Federated Area and Lancashireis not yet in operation.     The promoters hope to start thescheme in April.   Here the proposal involves a levy to subsidise,and thereby increase, export, speoial care being taken not tosell at lover prices than are necessary to command a market.-1-
Northumberland and Durham are very nervous of the effect of this scheme on their export trade.      If the Federated area scheme workn, the obvious course for Northumberland and Durham is to form a cartel of their own and deal with the Federated Area.    The 7elsh scheme is still under discussion, and does not seem to be making rapid progress.After strong representations, the French C-overnment have abandoned their proposal to increase the Customs duty on coal.In Iron and steel, there is a rather more hopeful tone. Continental prices have risen, following increases of wages. British makers have consequently been able to get rather better prices, except -/here exclusive contracts have been made under the rebate scheme.    The rise in prices, makes the rebate scheme more attraciive to British buyers; and more buyers are availing themselves of it.Continental -forks are reported to be full of orders. There has been an interesting example of the Continental purpose to cut into our finished steel trade.     Continental makers of steel strip suddenly doubled their prices to British tube makers in order to assist Continental tube makers to cut out British.    This exactly bears out the forecast given to the Civil Research Committee by some of the more farsighted re-rollers.The forecast in the United States indicates that there -Till be a large volume of business for American steel firm:- f but at unsatisfactory prices.    In consequence, United States firms are showing some desire to make international arrangements for export markets.Trade in alloys is satisfactory.    Fairly satisfactory business is also reported in non-ferrous metals.In Shipbuilding, substantial orders have been placed; and the following table shows a   gratifying position, both
In the number of orders placed and in our proportion of world orders.Quarter endedBritish YardB.Foreign Yards.Total.31 Deo. 1926152,000271,000423,00031 Deo. 1927377,000250,000636,000In Cotton, tho demand for pieoe goods has improved; trade with tho Far East is ruch bottor*     Indian trade fair; South American good;    homo trede bottor than usual.    In spite of this the Lanoaehiro pcoition is very bad.    I have given every encouragement I can to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in the inquiry whioh they have started oovering the whole field of tho ootton trade, purchase of raw cotton, spinning, roanufaoture, finiohlng, merchanting.    I have suggested to them privately that It is very important they should bring Labour into the inquii*y, and I hope that they will be able to do thiB and hold the rest together.An attempt is also boing made by tho Yarn Association to bring about an amalgamation of American spinning mills, on the basis of a drastic writing down of capital and an arrange-ment with oreditors.In woollen and worsted there appears to be a distinct improvement; but there is still keen competition in dress goods at prioes below our costs of production.In artifioial silk, tho outlook is very good all round.The Chemical trade is quiet. Fine chemioals oontinue to progress undor tho stimulus of tho Koy Industry duties.In all the Rubber industries, manufacturers report good trade, In spite of the uncertainty as to the future of rubber. This uncertainty is, of course, greatly embarrassing manufaoturore in deciding how far to buy ahead.Trade in boots and shoos in good.
Tho Laoe trado reports bottor prospeots, and thanks to tho duty, firms have boon ablo to on,rry on through a diffioult timo and develop new lines;    and they are in a position to take advantage of a ohango of fashion in ladies&apos; underwear which is allsgod to be in sight.Business in food manufactures is satisfactory.Shipping freights remain low, hut orders placed for ships indicato a reasonable spirit of optimism.    The Chambers of Commoroo are trying to organise representative bodies of shippers in the different trades to discuss ratos with shipping oonferencos.    This is a sound ir.ove and on the lines recommended by the Imperial Shipping Committee.Overseas trade in February.    Compared with January, 192P, and allowing for tho difference in working days, imports are up by about 2-g- per cent.    The increase is in raw materials, manufactures being about steady.    Exports as a wholo are at about the samo level;    coal slightly up;    exports of manufactures 6 per cent, down, principally owing to ootton and machinory.    Iron and steel exports are about at the level of the previous month.    Imports of iron and steel are slightly up.Leaving aside february, 1P5?7, as an abnormal post-strike month, and comparing with February, 1926, and allowing for changed prices, and an extra working day, we got the following results:-Imports of food and manufactures are greater in February, 192P, by about 2% per cent;Imports of raw materials rather less;Exports in February, 192P, are donn by 5 per cent.The deorease is principally to be found in cotton (11 per oent. down); ooal (8 per cent, down); iron and steel (7 per cent. down).While exports  show this small diminution, the purchasing power in the home market steadils&apos; increases.    The Co-operative
Wholesale Sooiety, perhaps the best index of working-olaee purchasing power, records increased sales In every section; and Mr. Hayhurst, one of the Managing Direotors, says that it is surprising, in spite of the depression we hear of, that the savings of the people seem to increase.I put to my Advisory Council the view which we had formed in the Board of Trade, that It would be bad polioy for us at the present time to negotiate a commercial treaty with France, and that our best policy was to rely on the continuance of the most-favoured-nation treatment we have so long enjoyed under French law.   The Advisory Council were in general agreement with our polioy.I rsoeive constant oomplaints from various trades that Spanish trade polioy seeks to put every impediment In the way of foreign trade short of an actual breach of the letter of our oomrceroial treaty.I have at last succeeded in getting   what, I hope, Is a definite move forward In a oampaign of simplification and standardisation.   As the result of a number of meetings, a permanent Standing Committee has been appointed under the Chairmanship; of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade, and consisting of representatives of the Federation of British Industries, Associated Chambers of commerce, Iron and Steel Federation, British Electrioal Manufacturers, British Engineers Association, British Motor Manufacturers, London Chamber of commerce, together with the Office of Works , contracts Co-ordinating Committee, Crown Agents for the Colonies, and the British Engineering Standards Association.(Intld.)

COAL.L0HD GAINFORD stated that the demand for blast furnace coke during the first two weeks of February had been decidedly better than for January, and prioes both for blast furnace purposes and for shipment has strengthened.    In the last two weeks of February there had been a falling off, owing to the faot that two furnaces in Cleveland had been entirely stopped.    Un the west coast, it had been decided not to re-atart the furnaces at Ulverston, and porhaps one would go out at iiilllom for re-lining,     The quantity of surplus coke hod consequently been increased and the price of coke for shipment was thereby rendered weaker.     Foundry coke was fairly steady.The price for unscreened coal was very weak; although the collieries were trying to maintain the price at 13/6 to 14/- f .o.b- Tyne, not, more than 13/3 oould be obtained.    There was, therefore,  lost time at many of the Durham pits.    The position of manufacturing and housohold coal was about the same as a month ago.     Trie reduction in wages due to arbitrators&apos;  awards in Northumberland and Durham came into operation on March 1st.MR. RIDLEY WARHAM wrote:-&quot;The weekly output of coal in tiie United Kingdom for the three weeks ending February 18th was in each case just over the five million tonB per week mark and was about 96$ of the march 1925 weekly average basis.     The number of persons employed, in the indUBtry for the week ending February 18th was 85.2^0, oalculated on the same basis.    Unemployment for the month of January was 18.1^ as against 17.3^ in December 1927 and 9.3^o in March 1926.    The quantity of coal exported in January was 3,904,700 tons as compared with 3,886,405 tons in December.   The value, however, showed a further fall, being  3,074,096, or 15/9 average price per ton f.o.b., as against 16/1 in December.&quot;Since last month tho Scotch scheme for a regulation of their output seems to have been approved and is expeoted to come into force as and from today the 7th March, 1928.    This scheme is based upon the idea that the capacity of the Soottish coal fields is not too great for normal requirements, but is too great for the present state of demand.      It is proposed to roduoe the output at the moment while keeping all the Collieries in being.    It is hoped that this will have a steadying effect upon prices and that it may even affeot tho prices for export to a limited extent.     The scheme of the Midland coal owners, on the other hand, is to force their coal on to the export market at the expense of their home trade.    If really carried through, it is feared that it 1b likely to make the Scotch scheme of no effect, besides the risk of putting the North East Coast out of business.    The Northumberland Collierios have temporarily entered into a
OPAL (OONTD.) .mutual understanding to adhere to minimum prices for export coal, which will, however, be completely upset by the launching of the Midland scheme.     The South Wales scheme is still progressing.    It has not yet come into operation, although it is hoped that it will do so very shortly.&quot;IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND thought there was a somewhat more hopeful tone prevailing in tho iron and steel industry than for some time past.     Continental prices had recently shown a tendency to rise, due, in the first place, to the fact that, most Continental works were now full up for three or four months ahead, and in some cases, even as far ahead as August, and In the second place, to the rising costs of production on the Continent.    The rising costs on the Continent were due to increased wage costs (especially in Germany) and, in the oase of Franco, also to the Increased railway rates,&quot; Another factor tending to the more hopeful tone in British iron and steel circles was the increasing demand from constructional engineers and shipbuilding yards.    During the month prices of steel plates and joists were raised by 5/- per ton for home consumers, but thiB increase did not affect those participating   in the rebate scheme, - aB the amount of the rebate had now been inoreased from 5/- to 10/- per ton on plates,  and from 7/6 - 12/6 to 12/6 - 17/6 per ton on joists.      In the case of joists there was a differentiation according to tonnage.      The rebate was very substantial and. was likely to be more attractive to the consumer.      Mr. Bond understood that good contracts for shipbuilding materials had been placed on that basis.Cleveland pig iron makers, by making substantial saorifioeB, had now recovered complete command of the home market, and such pig iron as was now being imported was on account of old orders.    Cleveland was also getting a better share of the Scottish pig iron demand, and there were enquiries from the Continent.      On the other hand,  Iron ore prices had risen owing to tho strike of Swedish ore miners, which had caused Germany to compete with Great Britain for Spanish   ore.    So far, no new furnaces had been put into blast on the North East coast, and the numbor in operation still stood at 39 out of the 100 that existed in that area.   The Scottish pig iron producers were still complaining bitterly of foreign competition in their own mar tcet.The feeling of optimism had not yet been supported by the placing of substantial orders, but there did seam some reasonable prospect of a alight improvement in the industry, and it was hoped that this improvement would be revealed in the figures of production for February and March, when those were forthcoming.     This, however, was only the result of Improvement in world demand, and in the main, was due to the fact that Continental works could no longer offer early delivery and, therefore, the consumers were turning to
ISOIRON AND STEEL (CONTD.)British works for their supplies.    In the case of one well-knovm works former customers had returned, who for several years past had been purchasing from the Continent.   While this was gratifying for the moment, a position which permitted of improvement in the British iron and steel position only when the Continent was too busy to accept more orders, was eminently unsatisfactory.    It was essential, if the British Industry was to survive, that British iron and steel makers should be placed in a position where they could command a fair share of the business that was going, in open competition, whether the Ccntinent was full up with crders or not.As an example of the ultimate purpose of Continental competition in semi-finished material in this market and the growing competition in finished material, Mr. Bond mentioned that quite recently Continental rollers of steel strip which was being supplied to this country, through merchants or direct to tube makers, nearly doubled their prices without any warning, thereby involving both merchants and tube makers In a most embarrassing position.    The reason for this move on the part of the strip rollers was to enable Continental tube makers, who had meanwhile increased their production, to cap-ture what they could of the British tube trade, there being a greater profit on the finished tubes than on the strip.    This demonstrated clearly the position that would arise if the iron and steel Industry were still further weakened; it would then no longer be possible to buy foreign steel at very low prices, but British consumers would be compelled to pay whatever price might be demanded.Continental prices of sheet bars had risen about 7/6 per ton.   As a result of that rise the production of steel in South Wales was likely to be increased.    The sheet trade was very quiet.   The tinplate Industry was maintaining its position. The trade was only working 75 per cent, of capacity, but, to this limit of capacity the works were well booked.   Consider-able pressure was being brought to bear upon their respective Governments by tinplate producers in Germany, France and Spain te withdraw the rebate which was at present given on tlnplates imported into those countries and worked up for export in the form of canned goods.     Our export of tin plates to Spain was very important and the value of the rebate was very important.Mr. Bond had had the opportunity during the last t wo or three weeks of long conversations with prominent people in the United states steel Products Company who had oorae over here.   They evidently felt satisfied that the Iron and steel trade in the United States was going to be good this year; but they were intensely dissatisfied with the level of prices. It was a matter of interest to note that the feeling in the United states and in Germany towards international arrange-ments was continually growing stronger.    Mr. Bond believed both the United States and Germany were quite willing to make international arrangements in the export trade in iron and steel, if we were in a position to meet them.
IRON AND STEEL (OONTU.).LORD GAINFOAD said that the stoel works on the north east coast had been doing slightly bettor in February than in January.     It was thought that the buying which had boon taking place recuntly on the Continent was largely speculative and to replenish stocks against a possible otriko in Germany.During January, imports of iron and steel Into the United Kingdom amounted to 283,900 tons, compared with 280,500 tonB imported during Docembor.      Imports of pig iron only, during January, to the United kingdom showed a slight decrease compared with December, whilo imports of bars, angles and girders had increased from 41,500 tons to 45,200 tons.     Exports of iron and steel during January amounted to 332,000 tons compared with 352,000 tons in jjeoember.     The outlook for the British steel trade was slightly brighter but the time when British works would be employed to their full capacity seemed still to be far off.liR. PUGK wrote:-&quot;while the comparatively lower figures of iron and steel production for the opening month of the year do not, by themselves, indicate improved conditions, there are signs in other directions which appear to show that the hopeful feeling which undoubtedly prevails is not without some foundation.     Ihis has been helped by events abroad.   Tho re-establishment of the throe shift system in Germany and Poland removes to th&amp;t extent whatever competitive advantage may be said to accrue to those countries from the two shift arrangement.      Although tho German workers have only obtained a small advance on their wage rates as a set off to the shorter working day, prices have beon raised.    In France and Belgium, too, various internal factors have increased costs which are reflected in Continental quotations on the British market and which now range from 5/- to 10/-per ton higher than was recently the case,    British makers have taken the opportunity to increase their prices, to those buyers who have favoured the foreign product, but at the same time have proportionately increased the rebate to those who undertake to buy the home made commodity.      In many cases, however, pricos of the home and foreign products appear to have become Bufficiently close to make the superior quality of the British steel and the guarantee of delivery, decisive factors in its favour.&quot;Employment in the heavy iron and steel Industry was bad during January, the percentage of unemployment at the date of the last returns for January being 20.4?:,    Although thiB is still a very high percentage, it is satisfactory to note that it is an improvemont on that existing In the middle of Deoember by over 2i%,&quot;From the returns of Continental exports, It would appear that the cheap French semi-finiohod stoel has found a substantial market in Germany and Belgium as well as in this country.    Her export of steel blooms, billets and bars for 1927 was as follows:-

IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.K&quot;The rapid growth of steel production by the principal continental nations, especially in the cheaper and inferior grades of the product, would appear to raise a question as to whether British manufacturers by their polioy of practically oonflning themselves to developing tho production of the higher grades, are really oatei lug for the class of customer who buys the semi-finished products referred to.     It is a policy which they had to abandon in case of the basic process.   For  any years that process was largely neglected in favour of the older acid process and although the enquiry of 1916 resulted In the recommendation that the basic process should be more largely developed, it was not until 1919 that our output of basic steel exceeded that of tho acid.     The discovery of the basic process had bean the making of the Continental steel industry and had largely contributed to Germany becoming the seoond largest steal producing   nation In the world.   To-day Germany&apos;s output of acid steel is loss than one per oent. of her total production; our own proportion is 33 per oent. of our total output.&quot;The Bessemer prooess, although producing an inferior and less reliable grade of steel, is undoubtedly less costly to work than the open-hearth Furnace method.      In this oountry the development of the opon-hearth furnace corresponded with the elimination of the Bessemer process, and that - with the exception of one Works - has never since been developed.    On the Continent, on the other hand, It has been so favoured that, excepting Germany, the steel manufactured is mainly by the Bessemer method.   And it 1b that class of steel whioh appears to compete most successfully in our home market and elsewhere. It is somewhat significant that the countries which are our keenest competitors for semi-finished products - Belgium and France - have 87$ and 70^$ respectively of Bessemer steel, but an examination of the matter tends to the conelueion that our competitors have secured for themselves a large demand for a form of steel which we do not produce, and that to meet that competition we are offering a better article, but so cut in price that it ceases to be profitable to produce it.These figures reveal the position:-Production of Open Hearth and Bessemer Steel by oertain Countries in 1925.Op vanHearth.Bessemer.Total including Other Steels.Great Britain.

3TJ3&apos; L.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR reported that the Sheffield industries had, on the whole, been somewhat disappointing of late.    The home trade In the first two months of this year together, January and February, had reached just about the same level as in the same two months of the previous year; there had been no Improvement, and It was rather disappointing because January had promised something better than that.     As regards the Continental trade, It had been found that in Germany where we were beginning to get a foothold, a patriotic movement was spreading:    they were making a point of buying German goods, and we had been rather losing ground than gaining^ it. In Spain there had been a continuous decreasein business with Sheffield.     iuost of our difficulties there were with the Customs.     To give an instance of what occurred:    Sir A. Balfour&apos;s firm shipped steel to Spain on 24th August, 1926:    the Customs took a sample on 29th August 1926, and the firm were informed of the analyrsis in Llarch 1928, by which time the whole of the steel had been brought into use.     They were fined to an amount of over  400.     They had had to send the goods in or they would have lost their customers, and then 18 months later they were faced with a Customs fine.Sheffield trade with Belgium was rather better; but with France It was practically dead.    It was found that the United States were competing very largely in Canada, par-ticularly In finished tools, and no doubt this was due to the falling off in consumption in their own country.     In all parts of South America we seemed to be doing very well. In New Zealand business was good, and In South Africa it was improving.     As regards China a very considerable improvement had occurred in the last four or five weeks, both In orders and payments.     Sheffield trade in Japan was uniformly bad, and even today difficulties arising out of the earthquake had to be cleared up, and year by year new losses were coming to light;    in fact many of the Sheffield firms had had to withdraw from the country.In the matter of alloys, the outlook looked to be very hopeful for this country.     One of Sir A. Balfour&apos;s companies were selling more alloys in this country than they had done for many years; and, to sum up, it appeared that the British steel trade generally, and also the use of these alloys, was increasing.     During the last week or so the prospects had been favourable, and if they continued so during the month the result would be reoson-ably satisfactory.NON-FERROUS utSTALS.SIR CECIL BUDD reported that the metal markets had been flat and the prices falling, but that was due rather to a falling off of requirements in foreign countries than here.     In this country, with the exception perhaps of copper, the demand for metals had been not at all unsatis-factory.     It was all for prompt delivery, which indicated that the manufacturers had not been hit by the drop in prices of the raw material, and there was evidence that the state of the order books was fairly good.     He was still mildly optimistic.
BMGIKgKRIjtG.SIR ERNiiST PETI R wroto;-&quot;The Foroign Traae Returns of the United Kingdom for January revealed a welcome reduction in the adverse balance of trade, when compared with tno corresponding month in the two previous years, and with the immediately preceding month. The quantity of machinery oxported in January amounted to 50,200 tons, which was considerably in excess of the quantity in December 1927, or in January 1927 and January 1926.    It dees, in faot, represent an annual rate of fully 600,000 tons, which would be 60,000 to 90,.000 tons bettor than has been attained in    any postwar year.    Tho average value per ton exported fell again slightly to  95.7.   The items which contributed most to tho rcontn&apos;s increase in total exports were textile machinery, prime movers, and boilers and boiler-house plant.   These figures may bo   viewed with reasonable satis-faction, but it is too early to regard them as affording a sure foundation for the optimistic predictions which are being so freely made.    Prices and profits are more Important than mere quantities, and the engineering Industry has yet a long steep climb to make back to a state of genuine prosperity.&quot;The level of general unemployment rose perceptibly after Christmas, perhaps to a greater extent than was anticipated; and the engineering indices of unemployment, at the end of January, showed appreciable Increases over December, with the exception of marine engineering, where there was a further improvement in employment.    But the weekly returns of the numbers of registered unemployed, which have been published since the end of January to date, show clearly that the volume of unemployment is again steadily diminishing,  and this may be expectea to apply also to engineering.&quot;COTTON.SIR K. STEWART stated that,  on the distributing side of the cotton trade, there had been, generally, a feeling of modified optimism.    The Far Eastern markets were in a better condition than for a long time past.    The most marked improve-ment had been in China, where the demand for British goods had been more active than since before the Spring of 1925.    The Dutch East Indies and the surrounding markets had also been fairly active.    The biggest market of all, Calcutta, was quiescent, but there appeared to be an under-current of optimism in that direction.     The other large Indian markets had bought fairly freely.    The South American markets had done a fair trade and had kept at much the same position as during the past month or two - which was a very good level.     The Home trade market the rather better than usual, and in most other markets there was no change.     There was, as usual, some want of confidence in the price of the raw material, but generally speaking it was considered as being at a reasonable level.
COTTON (OOKTU.) ,With regard to the efforts of tho Manchester Chamber of Oommeroo to get the various sections of the industry-together in Oommittoos, there was bound to be a considerable lapse of time before the Committees could be got running in any effective manner.      But a very great number of committee meetings had already been held, especially between the finishing and merchant sections.     Those were probably the simplest to get together, and they had got on very well indeed.      Some quite good progress had also been made in the case of tho other sections, but no definite results had yet been obtained.WOOL.MR. ARTHUR SHAW was glad to be able to say that the worsted trade had continued to improve,     He had recently made inquiries and found that the number cf unemployed on the bookB of all the Unions in the districts concerned had readied about the lowest level that had been touched during the last twelve months.     The figures for the Bradford district fell, in the week ending February 29th, to 5.01 a3 against 7.47 last year at the same timt,, and there had been a steady improvement in each week right away through from January.    (The figures are given at the end of Mr. Shaw&apos;s remarks).At the beginning of the current week there were practically no weavers unemployed at all in worsted manufacture. Those who were signing tho un-employment books were mainly from the worsted spinning section.    It appeared that there had been a tendency, particularly during the last 22 months, to increase the number of spindles as compared with the operatives,  and therefore production might be increased in the spinning department with no reduction in the number of unemployed.The remainder of tho peoplo on the unemployed books were mainly from tho plush weavxng section.     There was, however, one happy feature there.      Recently an artificial silk firm had been established which seemed likely to be a large one; and they were quite prepared to take all the competent silk workers who might be unemployed., as they became available. The proprietor mentioned a few days ago, however, that it was absolutely necessary for him to have a few competent weavers from Germany, and he seemed to anticipate some diffioulty.     The machinery was understood to be different from the class that was used in the Bradford trade,  and Borne of tho Bradford people who had worked upon it found a difficulty in the ir.it.ial stages of working.    It therefore seemed to be a perfectly fair proposition to bring in a few workers from Germany, ae this would be of benefit to the trade in our own country.
WOOL (OONTD.).THE PRESIDENT remarked that the matter must be settled with the Ministry of Labour.      If the introduction of these Gorman workers would assist In training our own people, and improve the proepeots of employment hero, it .appeared that they ought to be allowed to come in.MR. SHAW, continuing, observed that the hoavy woollon trade was certainly still in a bad way but was steadily improving.    The figures showed a deoreasej at the beginning of the year it had been 24 per oent.    It had now got down to 17-jjs- per cent.    In Huddersf ield employment remained very stable, except that in tho last woek they had had a sudden decrease of fully 2%,   That was purely the result of one firm temporarily closing down, andof course It did not indicate the position of the trade as a whole.Table handed in by Mr. Arthur Shaw.PERCENTAGES SIGNING THE VACANT BOOKS.

AYKR01D oonsidered that the position in the West Riding and the textile trade was fairly satisfactory.    The wool sales in Australia  and New Zealand were ooming to a close at the highest prices of the season.   Germany and the United States and the United Kingdom had bought rather less than last year.   France, Belgium and Japan had taken considerably more.   These were countries where the oost of produotion was lowest.    It was very interesting to know how the position of Japan was changing.    In 1914 Japan bought from Australia 5,000 bales.   This year she would finish in the neighbourhood of 100,000 bales,    It showed that we had a very big competitor in Japan.The quantity of maohinery running   was slightly better than it was In the previous month.    In the oombing industry 73 per oent. of the full oapaoity of the combs wore running, as against 65 per oent. the previous month.    Spinning was a little better.    In January 85 to 86 per oent. of the maohinery was running and now It would be in the vioinity of 90 per oont. The manufacturing side hod varied.    In tho dross trade there was a
1 v Ot;ocl. (contd. )little improvement in the Keighley district, that being the first sign of an improvement for some time.     In the Huddersfield district trade was good, but In Bradford it was still bad.     llr. Shaw had mentioned that there was no unera-ployment among weavers; but the latest figures of machinery running showed only about 50 per cent, which demonstrated the enormous shortage there would be in weavers, if the trade were anything like normal.COLONEL 7/ILLEY wrote:-&quot;A steady advance in raw materiel prices has continued the increase In machinery operation reported last month. Prospects in all branches continue to improve.     In the worsted section more looms are employed, and there is a better tone.     In men&apos;s wear business is good; in dress goods, imported fabrics are still obtainable at prices below any possible cost of production here.     Continental costs are evidently still much lower, and under present conditions In lighter weight fabrics, it would appear without the assistance of a duty, impossible for British manufacturers to compete.     In the t/woollen section, machinery employment continues much below capacity.     Hosiery is better, but forward buying is still reported as below what it should be.&quot;Prospects generally seem good and sentiment better, but largely as the result of the rise In wool valuesc     If machinery operation in Europe generally continues on anywhere near current volume, it would seem that, before the end of the year, wool supplies will be very low.     This is having the effect of stimulating the buying of fabrics11.artificial silk.IJR. ADD IS ON reported that business for the last month had proceeded on quite normal lines, and the outlook was very good all round.     Lancashire, perhaps, was in rather a dis-appointing position, because trade had not gone there in the was anticipated, owing possibly to labour questions over-shadowing the position. !^r. addison handed in the following table of figures of estimated world production of artificial silk in the last twelve months.     There was no large Inter-national federation that could supply figures with great accuracy, but his firm load obtained them&quot;from their a.rents all over the world, and had had them checked as far as possible from the trade and technical journals.     The total of 131 million kilos was equivalent to&quot;about 550,000 bales of American cotton, and if the world consumption of all kinc^s of cotton was 22 or 23 million bales, then the arftf^c^al silk production might be said to amount to about 2* Der cent, of the cotton production.

HILL considered that the tone of the chemical industry as a whole was decidedly quieter than waa to have been expected from its promising condition at the beginning of the year.    But the markets had been steady, with bright spota here and there, the bright spots being more evident in the exports  than in the home business.      In fine ohemicals the industry waa certainly progressing.   There had been very few changes in price, and there existed a feeling of confidence that a better outlook would develop, though   it would be hard to tell precisely on what that feeling   was based.In regard to the Bill for the partial revision of the French tariff, the text cf which had recently appeared, the association waa considering its details; and, as appeared at the present time, the chemical industry would have considerably less opposition than it had had last year.GAS INDUSTRY,SIR D. MILNE WATSON reported that there had been a fall in prices in certain important residual products: for example, pitch, which ohiefly went to France and Italy, was very quietART If IGIAL SILK (OOIITD.).

Great competition was also being mot with from bitumen, which was imported by the petrol companies.    As regards sulphate of ammonia, the demand, fortunately, was very good, but no change in price had resulted, and thero was unlikely to be any upward change, owing to the very largw production of synthetic all over tho world.With regard to gas coke, the market was dull, ohiofly owing to the very mild weather which had prevailed hero, and also in Soandinavia where it chiefly went. In gaB itself, sales had been good, if one took into consideration the very mild weather we had been having.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON reported that-the rubber manufacturing industry had moved, on the whole, fairly satisfactorily during February.    The tyre section had been fairly active, although the motor car industry seemed to have had some difficulty in disposing of Its output.     Rubber footwear had had a very successful season owing to the severs winter and the summer footwear was opening out well.    The general rubber industry, incd.udi.ng goods for engineering and other industries, remained constant, but not quite so active as before the end of the year.    The export trade, particularly to the dominions and the East, was satisfactory and steadily improving.    Employment remained satisfactory, and a fair amount of overtime was being worked in all sections.Mr. Johnston referred to the uncertainty that had been caused by the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement of an enquiry into the question of the restriction of rubber. The feeling was that the industry would have oontinued to make still further progress, if that announcement -had not had the distinctly unfortunate effect of causing buyers to hold off in the expectation of a lower prioe.     It had also caused a good deal of embarrassment to rubber buyers owing to the rislc of accumulating stock and the strong element of speculation about buying ahead for future requirements.    It would certainly bo an advantage if some assurance were given that no change in the restriction scheme would be made before the&apos; end of the year, or any sudden action taken which might have a disastrous effect on all conoerned.     The feeling of manufacturers and producers was that, while the scheme would probably come to an end, thero should not be the uncertainty-that existed at the present moment which had oaused a drop ,J.n price from about 1/7 to about l/l .THE PRESIDENT agreed that it was very unfortunate that information about the enquiry had got out in America, through an entirely unauthorised channel. If, however, the Government had to review the actual effect of the rubber restriction scheme, the fact that it operated at present entirely to Che
RUBBER (CONTD)advantage of the Dutch had to be considered, and if e fixed date vrere announced in advance it might turn out afterwards that the date was a wrong ono for the British, interests concerned.     The fixing of a date in advance wouii In any case tend   to decrease the possibility of a favourable deal with the Dutch interests.BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR.m HACKING- stated that at the London Fair there were this year 1,S58 overseas buyers, or an increase of 400 over last year, and 102,078 home buyers, or an increase of 30,000 over last year.     The public were not encouraged to crane to the London Fair; the figures for them were 28,484, or an increase of 4,000 over last year.     The last time he went round all the exhibitors he suoke to appeared satisfied with the business that was being dome; and already over 100,000 square feet of space had been hooked for next year.     The general improvement in business^ was evident in leather, toys, china, glass, and the wireless and pottery sections.As far as Birmingham was concerned, there were no exact figures, but, approximately, the overseas buyers, the home buyers and the public who visited ihe Fair numbered 117,000 or an increase of 25,000 In the combined totals over last year.     He thought that general satisfaction was expressed by the exhibitors there too.     In the case of both exhlbi-tions all the 1928 figures were records.     133,000 more square feet were occupied by exhibitors this year than in 1S27.     The only difficulty next year would be to find sufficient space both at the rhlte City and at Birmingham. On the whole it could be safely said that the British Industries Fair had been a tremendous success, and it appeared to be increasingly so each year.GBNERAL TRADE.L5R. VYLE stated that, so far as could be seen from the reports of the Chambers of Commerce, trade in general in February was better than In January,     In the Midlands the boot and shoe industry continued to be busy, oompletlng contracts that had already been entered into.     But owing to the high price of leather and the difficulty of getting it, the future did not seem to be very propitious for new business.     There was a large trade with the United States, where the English last was preferred to the somewhat ugly American last with the large toes.     In regard to hosiery, it was reported that the makers of real silk stockings continued to be well employed.     Evidently some people were still able to buy the real article, as opposed to artificial silk hose. In the lace trade there was a more optimistic feeling, as Paris had decreed that lace should be worn on underclothing. This of course had given a fillip to trade In Nottingham. The report from Nottingham went on to discuss the question of safeguarding and to say how beneficial the duty had been to all the firms In the lace trade: that if they had not
GENERAL TRADE (CCNTD. )had the safeguarding duty they vfculd have been very, very much worse off.        Tbe President of the F.oard of Trade had declared that there were a thotisand more people employed in the Industry then there had been before the duty r/as put on.Other oarts of the country were also reporting that business was mending, and In many industries there was quite a healthy tone.LORD GAII; FORD, speaking for the Federation of British Industries, stated that the situation appeared steadily to Improve.     The movement, however, ros slow, partly as a result, no doubt, of the adverse effects of the had weather during January., and partly owing to the unfavourable turn given to the monetary situation by the raising of the United States Federal Reserve re-discount rates.     As anticipated by the Federation, the raising of the Chicago re-discount rate to 4 per cent load been followed shortly by similar action on the part of the New York Reserve bank, a movement which put an end to the hopes of an early re-duction in our own bank rate.     1 hile, however, the monetary position was difficult, the Bank of England had been able to strengthen Its position sufficiently to make it possible to look forward to a reduction, at least for a time, of the bank rate later in the year, provided there were no unfavour-able developments in other quarters.     Accordingly, despite the fact that industry had not received the much needed stimulus of a fail in the bank rate, and was probably in a position to absorb considerably more banking accommodation than was available, the outlook for a continuance of expanding trade was good.     A particularly encouraging feature was the improvement in the outlook of the depressed metal industries, due to the falling off in the pressure of competition, as a result of the better adjustment of prices with competing countries.As to non-ferrous metals, the future of tin was far from clear, but the worst of the adverse features which had controlled the situation for some time past seemed to be slowly disappearing,.     In the Spelter section prices load fallen owing to continued liquidation and -:bear;! selling. Consumers had again been in the mar!:et, but not on such a large scale as in previous months.Little change was reported during the month in the condition of the raw wool market, which remained good. In the yarns section the price factor continued to be the most important feature, as it was very difficult to book large orders on present day quotations.     The Immediate position was slightly easier owing to the fact that the majority of spinners were fully employed on old oontracts. In the export trade, very little business was being transacted at the moment with the Far Eastern markets. The West Riding had been only able to sell fine fabrics abroad.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)Some improvement had been witnessed in the position of the cotton trade during February, and the immediate outlook appeared to be a little brighter.   Raw cotton had been steady with a slight upward tendency.    The turnover in yarns had increased during tho past two weeks, especially in medium American counts, but prices were still unprofitable.   The majority of the new business in cloth was in the finer fabrics. The hosiery trade had shown rather more animation of late-The condition of the cutlery and plate trade of Sheffield was fairly quiet, whilst the hard-ware industries of Birmingham hoped lo receive considerable benefit from the 3ritish Industries Fair.     The trade in galvanised hollow-ware continued satisfactory, some buying coming from Germany.    The pottery trade had tended to expand in February.    The condition of the boot and shoe trade was rather uncertain, the chief concern of manufacturers at the present tine being the rise in price of the raw material which had been taking place for some months past.A steady flow of orders in engineering and shipbuilding had been reported during the past month, important shipbuilding orders having been placed by the Admiralty, whilst various railways had placed contracts for a supply of locomotives. The motor industry continued to be a valuable asset to Sheffield at the present time, as an Increased demand for parts and tools had developed.    Constructional engineers reported that they had sufficient contracts on hand to maintain the existing level of employment.    Motor car manu-facturers were rather busier in view of the approaching summer season.To sum up, there did not appear to be any prospect of an immediate boom, but it was felt that, on the whole, the trade of the country was steadily expanding.    Even in the coal trade, ^hile it vas not expected that there would be any great improvement this year or even next year, there was not unlikely to be a better demand.    Our ships might before long come to be automatically fed -with pulverised coal, and this might compete very favourably with oil.    A good deal was being done also, in research, in securing liquid spirit from coal.    There was, of course, a great complaint about low wages, but it was absolutely essential that we should cut our costs down, and on the Continent, from which the keenest competition had cone, the tendency was for wages to rise from their present lo.^ level.bIR S. MAOHIN agreed with Lord Gainford and others that there was no sign of any boom, but that, on the other hand, we were holding our own.    The happier conditions existing between the employer and the employed gave one confidence, and were improving the outlook generally.    It was also gratifying to 3ee that the Government realised the vital importance of relaxing the burden of local rates.    Scarcely   anything could be imagined which would benefit industries more than a reasonable curtailing of extravagant rates, which had risen in raany cases to alarming proportions; and it was to be hoped that such extravagance might be stopped and some kind of relief afforded in the near future.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).In the export trades, again, prospects were certainly very hopeful:    they had opened this year rather &quot;better than they had done last year5    and this fact was emphasised by the experience we had had in the last fortnight at the Industries Fail&quot; where the enquiries this year had been very greatly in excess of what we had last year.5^&quot;CPers-tIve &quot;/bolesale Society.MR. HAYHURST reported that the Society was experiencing a considerable increase in trades which lay between the luxury end and tbe necessity end, such, for instance, as the furniture and the boot and shoe trades.    In footwear, they were selling about three million pairs a year, but were going this year to be about 250,000 pairs short of the demand.     It was surprising that in spite of the-depression that we heard about, the savings of the people seemed to increase.    That was a factor we could not ignore:    and if we published the brighter side of our circumstances as freely as we published the darker side, perhaps we should give a better and truer impression to the world.    It was not, of course, for a moment to be doubted that many sections of our trade, such as the cotton trade, fere in a bad condition;    but although people were doing badly their thrift had held their heads up and their purchases were continuing and increasing.THE PRESIDENT agreed.. He had also frequently pointed to the    increases in the number of people taken into work, as a contrast to the number of people who were out of work. That point had been taken up in the press and had made a good impression.Summary of Report handed In by Mr. Hayhurst.During the present month sales in almost every section shew good substantial increases and the outlook all round is of a favourable character.    A scrutiny of the figures shews that the stocks held are on the usual lines, both as regards quantity and prices. The production of goods, both food and otherwise, shew a high percentage of increase in the aggregate -one or two plaoes, which usually shew a slight falling off at this particular time of the year, indicate slight decreases.    It is confidently expected, however, that within the next few weeks these small decreases will be wiped out.Butter. Reports indicate tha&apos;-- a fairly heavy demand for Danish has ruled during the past few weeks, which has &quot;bared&quot; somewhat the markets on this side, and buyers have been ready for next arrivals. This would indicate a further advance in price. New Zealand and Australian supplies have had a high tendenoy. Shipments have been cleared without difficulty.

Supplies of Canadian, September make, are now very limited.     Those offered have been of excellent value. Arrivals of New Zealand have been cleared very readily, which has had the effect of creating a somewhat firm position.      Lancashire and   Cheshire have been in short supply, and relief cannot be expected for a week or two yet.Sugar. A recent advance in price has been -veil maintained, and reports of heavy sales are to hand.    It is stated that although buyers generally are covered for the next few weeks, with a consequential anticipation of quietness so far as now business is concerned, there is a feeling of greater confidence in the market than has been evident for 3ome time past.    Again America is the dominating factor so far as price is concerned, and movements there are being watched with interest..heat.    The market has been irregular of late, a recent advance being based on a false report that a large foreign wheat-growing country was buying wheat and flour. However, price eased a little.      It is stated that the present visible supply of -wheat is the largest ever known, being approximately 53 millions qiiarters.    Good Sales have been effected during the month.Tea.    It is now generally admitted that there is not likely to be any fall in home prices, especially if the climate does not improve in Northern India, which will make certain a shortage in the world&apos;s crop for this season.Cocoa.    The decline in the price on the &quot;Vest African Coast xn December had not kept for long, and with the opening days of the new year prices were hardening.    To-day the average prices are shillings in advance of twelve months ago, and 30/- over two years ago.    The hone markets are following.Chocolate.      Chocolate factories are now working on the Easter trade and for export orders.    The home trade in chocolate is dull.GENERAL   TRADE AND BANKING.MR. HOLLAND MARTIN stated that, with the gathering in of the taxes , money had been very much in demand and the rates had stiffened somewhat.    There   had been a very large number of new issues, and the Stock Exchange had certainly   been active. Shilling shares had played rather a considerable part in that activity, and Mr. Holland Martin thought that the tendency in regard to those shares was a bad one.    It seemed to have
Iri f-CONFI DEITT IAL. GENERAL TRAPS AND BANKING (CONTD. ) .been very much overdone, and to be leading ieople to gamble. At the same time more money was being invested than in the past and one found a tendency for investments to be made further down the scale.    Poor people were putting their money into industrials, which was all to the good.In trade generally the tendency seemed to bo slightly upward     Of course there were very black spots in the cotton and coal branches,  but, speaking generally, there was a steady improvement.BANKING.MR. CURRIS reported little change in the condition of the London money market since the last meeting of the Council. Money had remained in good demand and the three months bill rate had not varied much, having remained in the neighbourhood of 4f per cent.    The dollar exenange had remained favourable and the Bank of England had continued to secure gold in satisfactory quantities.    A reduction in the bank rate did not, however,  seem probable in the immediate duture.    On the Stock Exchange the tone had been generally good, especially in the gilt-edged market.SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW observed that the optimism of shipowners was shown by the fact that in the quarter ended December 31st, 1927, there was commenced in British yards a gross tonnage of 377,492, as against a gross tonnage commenced abroad of 258,696. That completely reversed the position in the quarter ended December 3lst,  1926, when a gross tonnage of 152,000 was commenced in British yards and 271,000 in foreign yards.    In the earlier quarter not only was the total tonnage commenced in the world less, but the foreigner was building the great bulk of it, whereas now, a year later, the total tonnage had gone up,  roughly from 400,000 to over 600,000, and of that the lion&apos;s snare had gone to British yards.    Whether that feeling of confidence on the part of the shipowners was justified depended entirely on the general trade.    It was&apos; important to know, however, that in January of this year the index figure of freights (compared with 100 in 1920) was 25.3, while in January 1927 it was 30.36.    At the same time there was rather more tonnage laid up.    The figure for January of this year also showed a decline on that for December 1927, which was 27.11.    That was an unusual movement at this time of the year, and it was very difficult to find any specific cause for it.with regard to the Shipping Conferences which had been referred to in a recent debate in tho House of Commons, Mr.Shaw pointed out that the object of those Conferences was first of all to make it possible in the trades which were covered by the liners to run regular lines.    That was done by
1 r)DSHIilIHG (CONrD. )giving to those who supported the Conference lines a rebate -it was perfectly public and not nt all secret - on the amount of freight which they gave.    Without the security of that support by the merchants, these liners could not continue to t-rive a regular service.    A particular instance had occurred recently when a passenger liner for Australia, with a capacity of 10,000 tons, left London on a regular schedule .vith 8*000 tons empty space.    That voyage would result in a loss of many thousand pounds,  even should that ship sail back full.    She charged stabilised rates,  and were it not for the fact tnat there were these Conferences, she would probably not have sailed at all.    She sailed as an act of good faith to the merchants who supported the Conference.    Besides the regular service, there was another advantage in the stabilisation of freights, viz.  that they were uniform to all shippers large or small.    It was of course untrue to say that the Conferences fixed freight rates at a level which   .was always remunerative to the shipowners.    For seven years out of ten, liners were running at a loss,  they could not even cover depreciation, and it was impossible,  even if it were desirable,  that the Conference could fix rates at a level remuneration to the shipowner.    What they could do was to stabilise them so that there should not be from day to day or from week to week a movement which would disturb the predictions which the merchants had to make in their dealings with their customers abroad.    An attack had been made upon these Conferences - he thought from lack of information - upon the ground that the freight rates charged to the British manufacturer were in some cases considerably greater than those which were charged to, say, the German manufacturer.    That was not because the chipping Conferences wished to inflict any injustice upon the British merchant or manufacturer.    If a British ship did not take these German goods they would be carried in German bottoms, to the great advantage of the German mercantile marine.    This would not result in the exclusion of these foreign goods from neutral markets,  but would merely make the British liner trade so unremunerative that   very likely the liners would have to drop out of it.    They would be laid up; and the only effect of making it impossible for British shipowners to meet the foreign competition would in the long run be a disadvantage, not only to the British shipowner and the British manufacturer, but to the whole mercantile world.    The foreign liners had to meet a very different state cf affairs from that obtaining here.    To take an instance, they had only to pay the port dues of,  sayj Hamburg, which were very low, whereas British ships had to pay the extraord.ine.iily high port dues of London, Liverpool, Hull or Middlesbrough, whjoh were on an altogether higher level.    Stevedores1 wages here were high and so -were those of coal trimmers, and the whole cost in a British port made it often impossible to qxiote the same freights as were quoted in a foreign port.In conclusion, t!r.Shaw referred to the President1 s suggestion in the House of Commons that shippers and traders should form themselves into representative organisations able to deal with tho Conference lines on different subjects.    That suggestion was heartily welcomed by the shipowners, and it would be an enormous help to them if there were bodies of that kind with whom they could confer,  so that they might look into particular difficulties together in order to try to get over them.
SHIPPING (COKTD.)MR. VYLE mentioned that active steps were being taken to set up such bodies as were suggested.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR JOSIAH STAMP observed that passenger receipts on two of the railway groups had improved.    The L.M.S. were inclined to the view that a great part of this increase was due to an improvement so far as spending power was concerned, in those industrial centres which were so depressed a year ago.7/hen the traffic rates were increased last year as from February, It was generally understood that the increase would put them on the whole on about the same level as the new rates that came into force on the new classification from 1st January this year. 11 was still not knorai exactly however whether this was s*:    it was impossible to say whether the weighted average of the present rates would be more or less than the weighted average of last year.&apos;   On the whole It might be fractionally less, but the allowances that were made for the financial effect of the &quot;continuous mileage&quot; since 1st January would - It seemed clear - be more in favour of industry and against the railways than had been allowed for.    There was going to be a greater loss in receipts due to &quot;continuous mileage&quot; than we had thought there might have been; so that also made for uncertainty in the receipts week by week.    Then the colossal work involved in dealing with the rates in the 22 classes, as against the 3 which had become rooted in the minds of the railway staffs who had worked in connection with them, - that was gradually being overtaken;   and the uncertainty in the weekly figures, owing to a considerable proportion of the invoices being provisional, was also being overhauled.    That uncertainty had been allowed for as far as estimates could do it; and in so&quot;far as the estimates had been wrong, they were gradually being put right.Operating statistics were now, it was understood, the best since the war.    This was to be attributed very consider-ably to the changing attitude of the men;   because half a minute lost here and half a minute lest there made all the difference in the aggregate.;- There were also improvements in the organisation itself.    But there were two important factors to be considered in the relationship between industry generally and the railways.   Firstly, great advantage might be obtained at the terminals if something like a regular distribution of traffic could be secured;   but Industry on the whole was not showing much disposition to reduce the pressure at night, or to get the saving that might be looked for by arranging the work more evenly.    It might  &quot;come in time, but there was not much sign of it yet.     In the second place, the economic revolution which had taken place since the beginning of the war in the consigning of traffic still continued unabated.    Some time ago it was estimated that, in the case
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  (COIITD.)of traffic involving handling, the average number of con-signinents per ton was 2h to 5 times what it wa3 before the war, but every return showed the number to be more than the last.   As a reflection of the methods oi  the retailer In living from hand to mouth, or in refusing to take a risk, It was still going on;   and that was, of course, a most important matter.    The demands on the railway companies were far greater from the point of view of carriage und rapidity.MR. HURC0M3 said that the railways receipts for the eight weeks of this year had shown a decline of rather more than a million compared with 1927.    The decline hi receipts from&apos; coal was ::o doubt largely due to the exceptional activity in the early weeks of last year following upon the strike. The passenger traffic in the aggregate had continuously declined, although the Southern Railway and the London, Midland and Scottish showed small increases.    Comparing the passenger traffic for the month of December last with the month of December 1925, and excluding the London tubes, the standard gauge railways as a whole had carried about 4-g-milllon less people in December 1927 than they did in December 1925.    Their receipts had been less and they had run a substantially higher train mileage to carry that considerably decreased number of people.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figures for the first half of February, although they had fallen slowly, had been very disappointing, and he thought that that might have been largely due to the bad weather and its effect on the building traces and other outdoor employment.    In the last two weeks of February there had been a marked improve-ment, and on the 27th February the total was 1,103,700. This was definitely better than the figure for the same date last year and about the same ae in 1926.In view of the questions which had been asked about the numbers in employment as dis tinet from the numbers unemployed, Mr. Phillips ha extended in a table  (reproduced at the end of this note) which gave the estimated numbers of insured persons in employment at the end of June in each year from 1921 to 1927, and at the end of January and February of the present year. The estimate had been mace by deducting from the estimated number of insured persons the number recorded as unemployed, as shown by the lodged unemployment books (including the &quot;two months&quot;&quot; file), and making an allowance for sickness and other unrecorded non-employment, and also for trade disputes.
EMPLOYMENT (OONTi). ) .The allowance for sickness (included in the figure of 3^-per cent. In cols. 5 and 6) was at a flat rate of 2-  per cent, for the year, and so far the Ministry had not been able to allow for variations in that rate.    Under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; ana old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, persons aged 65 and over were excluded from Unemployment Insurance as from 2nd January, 1928.    The figures for January 1928, therefore, related only to persons aged 16 to 64,    In order to make the figures comparable throughout it had been necessary to exclude from the earlier figures the estimated number of persons aged 65 and over.   The Table, therefore, related throughout to insured persona aged 16 to 64 inolusive. sir. Phillips&apos; table is reproduced on the following page7.

ISOEMPLOYMENT (CGNTxj.)LORD GAINFORD remarked that it was, perhaps, necessary te point out that it was not quite safe at tho moment to place .very much reliance on the unemployment returns of the Ministry of Labour as an index of the state of trade, not only because the changes consequent upon the new old Age Pensions Act h^d affected the totals as  -well as the percentages of unemployment, but because the recent Industrial reorganisation in many sections of industry had involved some temporary dislocation of labour.CONDITIONS IN AUSTRALIA.iiiR. 3AL1DERS0N explained that he had not yet received his official cablegram, but mentioned that the present was the quiet time of year in Australia for all the producers of wool and wheat.     As regards the prospects for the coming season, the recent rains had done a great deal of good, except in portions of Queensland and in the south western portion of New South Kales.Mr. Sanderson afterwards sent in a cablegram from Australia of which the following is a summary:-Heavy rains fell during February resulting in improvement in outlook for pastoral, agricultural and dairy production, prospects for autumn and winter feed are now excellent.    Stock prices are hardening, and as the heavy demand for store stock will probably continue, the market should further improve. Preparations are being made for sowing largely increased areas of wheat, and it is estimated that 3,000,000 acres will be planted in Victoria alone.     Owing to the heavy crop of fruit special efforts are being made by the Canned Fruit Board to dispose of the surplus, and special attention is being given to these fruits in the publicity campaign in the United Kingdom.     A reduction of 3-g-   per cent, in the freight on butter and cheese from Australia to the United Kingdom will operate in the current season, provided the combined exports reach 40,000 tons.     A leading firm of 3ritish whiskey manufacturers proposes establishing a whiskey distillery at Geelong costing  200,000.     Representatives of the wine industry have submitted to the Minister for Markets a proposal for a scheme for the statutory organisation of overseas marketing of sweet wines.The 1928 cotton crop is estimated at 11,000,000 pounds, and there is very little prospect of disposing of the product on the local market.     As regards wool, the total quantity received In the main distributing centres for the 7 months ended January 1S2S was 2,189,500 bales.      1,572,900 bales were
19 1 1 olco 1 if x d. 2: ti al .CONDITIONS III AUSTRALIA (COiTTD.)sold, 21,300 bales rare shipped overseas for sale, and 595,300 bales wore retained in stores.     As regards sugar, the estimated production for 1928 will bo exceptionally-heavy.With regard to development generally, a conference of the New South Wales, Victoria and South Axistralian Governments was held in Canberra on 27th February, which recommended the creation of an Advisory Committee of Irrigation Development and Production, consisting of tno representatives each from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, one representa-tive from the Department of Markets, with a member of the Development and Migration Commission as chairman.   The functions of the Committee would be to collect information regarding production in all States and the suitability of land available for settlement, to investigate market prospects in Australia and abroad, end to advise on co-ordination of production and future development in existing and new areas.As regards finance, December quarterly averages of Australian banks show a rather better balanced banking position.     Bank Clearances in Australia, excluding Tasmania, in January last were  175-.874,500, v:hich is an increase of  1,719,000 over January 1927.INDIAN TrU-Dii.MR. GORDON, who attended on behalf of Mr. Lindsay, said that the nine months1 figures of trade ending in December showed a very favourable balance of some 50 lakhs in favour of India.     With regard to raw materials coming forward, the ootton forecast gave 5^ million bales against about 4.9 in the corresponding period last year, and unofficial figures would raise that Government estimate to about 6 million bales. The wheat forecast showed exactly the sane position as last year, just a moderately fair crop, but rith a slightly lower price.     The wholesale prices inde:-: figure fell in February by three points, from 148 to 145.     The Budget had shown quite a favourable position, no new taxes of any special kind were imposed and no taxes were taken off.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE;MR, HOSE wrote&quot;During the past month, the Argentine Ministry of Agriculture issued its first estimate of the area sown to maize for the season 1927-28, vhich Is placed at 10,584,000 acres, as compared with a final estimate  last season of 10,594,000 acres and a total harvested area of 9,055,000 acres. In the early part of the month, reports were received indicating that, although the
SOUTH AMERICAN TRA.Du ( COiTTD.) .growing plants were making good progress, further rainfall -vould be of considerable benefit.    Any fears of damage from drought, however, were finally dispelled by the heavy general rains which fell in the last days of February, so that even the latest sown maize is now regarded as safe in this respect. Slight iamage from locusts was reported, but It would appear that the crop has not suffered to any appreciable extent from this cause.    According to private advices, opinions as to the probable yield of the maize harvest vary between a total approximately equal to that of last year - 8,150,000 tons -and a million tons less, but it is yet too early to venture any definite forecast as to the outcome.&quot;The satisfactory nature of Argentina&apos;s trade.position is emphasised by the full official returns for the year 1927, which show that the total volume of produce exported was no less than 18,722,026 metric tons, against a total of only 12,277,627 metric tons in 1926,  shipments of cereals and kindred products having aggregated 16,324,851 metric tons, against 10,06-1,117 metric tons.    The general level of prices of imported goods was slightly lower than in 1S26, and were on a lower basis than in any of the post-war years.    Nevertheless, all the main groups of imports showed increases in total values last year, with the exception of agricultural merchandise. That the Argentine Government was fully justified in re-opening the Conversion Office in August last for the delivery of gold in exchange for paper is demonstrated by the fact that gold has been steadily flowing into the country, imports of the metal in 1927 having amounted to $06,550,000, against only $2,035,000 in 1226, while there have been no exports.    The official stock of gold held in the Republic at the end ox last ye&amp;r - ^560,006,276 - was the highest recorded in the history of the country.    I referred in my remarks last month to the broadening in the demand for textiles in Argentina, and it is satisfactory to note that later advices describe the outlook as favourable, particularly in the market for cotton piece goods, where surplus stocks have been absorbed and merchants are reported to be buying more freely.    Borrowing by the Argentine Government took place in New York early in February, when an issue of $20,000,000 in 5i). External Sinking Fund Gold Bonds was made at a price of 97) , and was rapidly over-subscribed.    It is understood that the proceeds of this loan, which is due for redemption in August, 1962, are to be utilised for funding the floating debt falling due this year.&quot;Sales of Chilean nitrate ox soda continue to be on a satisfactory scale,  the total amount disposed of since the introduction of free sales in April last year having now reached 2,893,140 metric tons, of which 153,702 tons are for delivery in the 1928-29 season.    Statistics for the period July, 1927, to January, 1923, show that, while production of the fertiliser totalled 1,287,325 metric tons,  exports amounted to 1,526,056 metric tons,  these figures comparing with 327,767 tons tuid 820,034 tons, respectively, for the corres-ponding period of the preceding nitrate year.    There has recently been published a message from the Chilean Minister of finance announcing that the Government will not take up before let July any resolution providing for a reduction in the nitrate export tax.    The measure for the revision of the Chilean Customs Tariff,  to which I referred in my last advices,
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.).has now received the sanction of the President and will become effective sixty days after promulgation in the &quot;Diario Oficial&quot;. A further example of the tendency towards &quot;Nationalisation&quot; is afforded by the recently promulgated lav/, which became effective as from 14th January last, establishing a Consejo de Pomento Carbonero, whose functions will be to advise as to the steps to be taken to improve the situation in the national coal industry, and to carry into effect the other provisions of the new measure.    For the purpose of providing funds for carrying out the projects specified in the Law, duties are to be placed upon imports of coal, coke and fuel oil, while authority is also given for the contracting of loans not exceeding an aggregate amount of $120,000,000 (Chilean) the proceeds of which may be utilised for furthering the produc-tion of foundry coke, etc., developing transport systems, and for the acquisition of coal-carrying vessels.    In addition, the Law contains provisions providing for the payment of subsidies to ships of Chilean nationality carrying coal, as v/ell as for the granting of advances to coal producers to the extent of $25 per ton of their output, the total of such advances not to exceed $5,000,000.    This Lav/ will, of course, directly affect exporters of coal to Chile, v/ho are chiefly in Australia and Great Britain.&quot;The revised Customs tariff in Peru, which came into operation on 2nd January last, v/as expected to result in some improvement in the import trade of the country, owing to certain modifications which were made in the import duties, but, since at the end of January the final tariff list had not been published,  the anticipated expansion has not yet fully materialised.    Reports as to the progress of the cotton crop are satisfactory, and, although some anxiety is expressed in the valleys on account of the limited flow of water in the rivers, prospects generally are excellent.    Planters of sugar appear optimistic in regard to the coming crop, and while it is as yet too early definitely to gauge prospects,  these may be regarded as above the normal.    The exchange position remains satisfactory, the value of the Peruvian pound having been steady throughout the month.    In this connection, it is reported frnm New York that the Peruvian Government has invited an expert in foreign exchange to head a Commission   of investigation for determining the level at which it is advisable to stabilise.&quot;In Uruguay,  importers of dry goods report that conditions in uhe local markets are fairly satisfactory, although prices of cotton goods showed a somewhat easier tendency during the early part of the month.    With regard to heavy goods,  the situation has improved, and, although stocks are considered sufficient for current requirements, importers take a favourable view of tho future.    The situation in the camps has continued satisfactory, pasturage having been abundant, while the condition of the livestock has improved.    Ample rain has fallen in the agricultural districts and crop prospects are generally favourable.&quot;The collection of the coffee crops in Nicaragua -which has been in progress since the New Y^ar has resulted in an improve -ment in general conditions and merchants   consequently report in-creased salas.

In the other uentral American countries, and in Mexico, there has beon no outstanding change in general commercial conditions during the past month&quot;.RUSSIAN TRADE CREDITS.Slit ARTHUR balfour observed that the Russians were beginning to come back and make trade enquiries in this country with slighlly less unreasonable Ideas in regard to credit.   They were talking about three, six and nine months, but were pressing for six to twelve months.   The President of the Board of Trade had pointed out in the House of Commons that this country had bought fourteen million pounds1 worth of goods from Russia in 1927, and had been able to soil to them only two million pounds1 worth.   Their reply was &quot;That is all very well, but we are paying in London for everything we buy from your Colonies, and for our insurance ana shipping; and while there Is a balance, it is nothing like the relation of 14 to 2.&quot;MR. HAYHURST said that the Russians, like most people, wanted to get all the credit they possibly oould; and, up to date, they had met their obligations, so far as their dealings with the Co-operative Wholesale Society were concerned.   The Society had declined one oredit for the time being, unless different arrangements could be made.    The terms they required from the Russians were 20 per cent, cash and 6 months-1  credit. But,  as Mr.    Hayhurst had previously said, it would be useful if those who were concerned in dealing with Russia had some sort of understanding amongst themselves, so as to help to develop the trade of the country because after all they could not afford to be played off one against another.THE PRESIDENT quite agreed that the British traders who were doing a large amount of business with Russia should^ confer as to the amount of credit that they ought to giveN. They could compete freely with one another, but at the same time could have some measure of agreement.SIR ARTHUR balfour also agreed.    He had said to the Russians: &quot;Your oredit is bad: you will have to ask for much more reasonable terms&quot;. Then they retorted that two large textile firms - he would not mention names - had given them up to two years oredit.MR. HAYHURST thought there was a great deal of doubt about it. He happened to know two textile firms that had done business with them.    One of these would not do any trade at allWMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM^
RUSSIAN TRADE CREDITS (CONTD.).v/ith them unless they had cash with the order.     But there certainly was another firm in another part of Lancashire which h&apos;&quot;d given them a great deal of credit, and had got very much tied up with it - as would he inevitable.MR. VYLE thought it was extraordinary that these long and large credits should he required by Russia, v/hen the credit was already in this country.   The figures were believed to run to something like eight million pounds, - that we had bought from Russia more than ,&apos;/e had sold to her.    The goods which had been bought from Russia had been paid for by our merchants in cash, so that there was this sum, - something like eight or nine million pounds - lying in London at the call of Russia.    If she liked to use that well and good, and if she used it in purchases in another country that&apos;al30 was her own business.    But so long as there wore eight or nine million pounds an the credit of Russia as the result of a year&apos;s trade, it was a little difficult to see why she should want these enormous credits, which were more than we should think of giving to the best customers we had on our books.SIR ARTHUR 3ALF0UR inquired whether Mr. Vyle would get the Association of Chambers of Commerce to bring about a meeting of traders in this country principally concerned in the matter. It should be done privately.MR. VYLE said he would consider the matter.SIR A. BALFOUR added that he had heard that the Russians were very anxious to have an interview here to make a proposition as to debts, without any extension of credits. The Russians seemed to be considering seriously no-r the question of their old debts, without bringing in any question of new credits.
THE PRESIDENT   said that he desired to inform the Council, entirely in confidence, that the Government had been consider-ing very carefully ?/hat was the best lino to take with reference to the now French Tariff proposals.   Ve had rot got very much in the way of direct concessions.   The Swiss had got something by mutual Tariff adjustments, and the Germans and Belgians also.   T.:e should obtain the benefit of these con-cessions under the Host-Favoured-Nation Decree.   The French reply to our protest was, in effect, to suggest that we might like to make a commercial treaty with thorn-Now, the Government had gone into this very carefully and there was not the least doubt that if we were to make a commercial treaty with France, they would not give us a really effective most-favourea-nation clause, which was what we wanted.    In return for our tying our hands very considerably In various ways they mjght put a most-favoured-nation clause into the treaty, and they might give a few reductions in their tariff rates.    But that v.ould not in the least bind them to consider our interests the next time they negotiated a bi-lateral tariff arrangement with some other country.    The very fact that they would like to make a treaty of that kind with us was a good indication that it would be to their interest, and not necessarily to our&apos;3.   ITe had for many years enjoyed most-favoured-nation treatment in France by virtue of a French lav/.    .Ve had received - not an absolute undertaking, but an intimation, - that the French had no intention of removing most-favoured-nation treatment from us.    Moreover, if they did attempt to remove most-favourod-nation treatment from us surely the card to play would not take the form of a treaty negotiation in which we would tie our hands and really gain very little.   The better thing to do would be to play the bigI 0 0
CONFIDENTIAL. TREATY RELATIONS T/ITH FMNCE (CONTD).political card on these lines; &quot;Look at the way we have treated you for 40 years; look at the history of our commercial relations with you; are you really going to do anything co unjust and unfriendly as to remove from us most-favoured-nation treatment, which has existed for so long, not as a mere treaty bargain, but as a part of your lav/?&quot;5/6 had come to the conclusion that that was the proper way in which to try to keep most-favoured-nation treatment, and that we should be extremely unwise to go and make a fresh treaty with France which was bound to be unsatisfactory, inasmuch as the French could stultify its value by subsequent treaties with other countries.   The Geneva principle of having the widest possible most-favoured-nation treatment, and having it universally applicable, was the best for us, and we should rest on these broad lines, and stand for general most-favoured-nation treatment, especially in the present condition of France.But someone might come to us and ask for detailed repre-sentations to be made to the French about this or that French tariff duty, in the interests of this or that British industry. The Government did not, however, propose to get themselves in-volved in detailed negotiations out of which they v/ould certainly not get any substantial advantage, and in which they would beIasked to give away substantial advantages. They would approach the French on General grounds by saying:    &quot;Not only are you not playing the Geneva part, but you have added some new or higher duties to  your schedules.&quot;   There was this difficulty to be encountered, however.    3ritish agents,  representatives and traders in France, who naturally sax? very clearly the disadvantages they might bo labouring under owing to adverse tariff treatment, would be very amenable to the suggestions of the French authorities, who would say:  &quot;Of course you have great difficulty in importing these goods, but all you have to do is to ask your Government to make a
CONFIDENTIAL. TREATY RELATIONS 7/ITH FRANCE (CONTD).commercial treaty with us.&quot;   Accordingly, when British manu-facturers and exporters over here got representations to this effect made to them by their agents in France, it would be necessary for them to refrain from backing up such requests by appeals to the British Government.The Council agreed that the policy outlined was right.
