PROGRAMME OF REDUCTIONS OF OFFICIAL STAFFS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I circulate an advance copy of the White Paper I propose to lay after the Budget Speech on the programme of reductions of official staffs in fulfilment of the announcement made by me in the Budget of 1927. An immense amount of labour has been devoted to this task during the whole of the present year, and I must acknow-ledge the assistance which has been offered to the Treasury by the Civil Departments. The publication of this paper will of course concentrate attention upon the staffs of the Fighting Services. The Admiralty in particular has been seriously reflected upon in the recent report of tho Estimates Committee of the House of Commons.W. S. C.&quot;Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 20,1928.&quot;7377Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1928.MOST SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 92 (28).CABINET.
STAFF REDUCTION PROGRAMME, 1927-1932.Detailed schemes for the reduction of the staffs of Civil Departments during the period of five years from 1st April. 1927, have been worked out by the Depart-ments concerned in collaboration with the Treasury. The reductions to be effected are shown in the annexed table. It will be seen that in the aggregate they amount to 11,127, or 18 per cent, of the total staff as at 1st April. 1927.The whole programme of reduction will only prove possible provided: (1) that the departmental estimates are not varied by new legislation, or important decisions of policy entailing considerable increases of staff;(2) that the Ministry of Labour in particular is entitled to assume, for the purpose of fixing the numbers of the Employment Department, that during the next five years trade will become good;(3) that so far as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the reduced establishments, departments will be at liberty to recruit candidates at the right age by open competition.A table is also attached showing the reductions effected year by year in the staff of Civil Departments during the period 1st April, 1925 1st January, 1928, i.e., during the lifetime of the present Government. Particulars are given in this table as to the Headquarters staffs of the Defence Departments, which have also been invited to work out schemes for the reduction of their staffs generally.
