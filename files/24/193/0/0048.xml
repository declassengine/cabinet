SECRET.Corr No. 2 I)CP.-99 (28).THE CABINET.THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE (ANNUAL) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.   The only provisions     110 to which I need draw the attention of my colleagues are those in Clause 4 relating to the  General death penalty.   It will be remembered that, following the report of the Committee of the    *217 three Services in 1925 (presented to Parliament Cmd. 237(5), the Army and Air Force I Annual) Bill of that year introduced amendments abolishing the death sentence for all military offences in peace except mutiny, but with one or two minor exceptions made no change in the list of offences for which the death penalty could be awarded on active -service.   Since then there have been signs that opinion is growing in favour of at any rate a reduction in that list, and it is of importance to ensure that the case for the retention of the death penalty, where, for military reasons, it is essential, shall not be weakened by its provision for offences for which it has been rarely fouud necessary of recent years to enforce it, or for which, under modern conditions, it can reasonably be held an unwarranted or disproportionate punishment.After careful consideration with my military advisers, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be held to be essential to the maintenance of discipline and morale that the death penalty should be retained for any military offences except mutiny in peace and war, and treachery, cowardice and desertion, including leaving a post or guard, on active service, and the amendments in Clause 4 of the Bill have the effect of abolishing the penalty for all other military offences. These proposals are concurred in by the other Service Departments. The Admiralty, I understand, intend to take the first opportunity of amending the Naval Discipline Act by abolishuig the death penalty for sleeping on duty in the presence of an enemy, which is the only offence under the Naval Code affected by the proposed changes, and, in the meantime, to give instructions that death shall not be inflicted as a punishment for this offence.L. W.-E.The War Office,26/A March, 1928.(BSS/17)   7o   3/27   W.O.F.   3608------2biPrinted for the Cabinet, March, 1928.
Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 4.The effect of this clause is to abolish the death penalty on active service for (1) leaving a commanding officer to go in search of plunder;(2) forcing a safeguard;(3) forcing or striking a sentinel;(4) breaking into any house or other place in search of plunder;(5) when acting as a sentinel sleeping or being drunk on a post;(6) striking or using or offering violence to a superior officer in the execution of his office;(7) disobeying in such manner as to show a wilful defiance of authority any lawful command given personally by a superior officer in the execution of Ins office;(S) altering or interfering with any air signal without authoritjr.The only military offences on active service which will remain punishable with death will he mutiny, treachery, cowardice, desertion, and leaving a guard, &amp;c. without orders, or hi the case of a sentinel leaving a post without being regularly relieved.Clause 5.Under the law as it stands, a requisition of emergency may prohibit all sales of horses or carriages other than sales to the War Department. These amend-ments would enable a less drastic prohibition to be issued where it was unnecessary that the prohibition should extend beyond specific classes or subdivisions of classes of horses or carriages.Tho clause also makes it clear that a requisition of emergency is subject to revocation and alteration.41-4 A
iiArmy and Air Force (Annual).   [18 Geo. 5.]Clause 6.S. 177 of the Army Act provides that where an Indian or colonial force is serving with part of the regular military forces, then, so far as the law of India or the colony has not provided for the government and discipline of the Indian or colonial force, the Army Act is, subject to such exceptions and modifications as may be specified in the general orders of the officer commanding His Majesty&apos;s military forces with which such force is serving, to apply to the Indian or colonial force.S. 177 of the Air Force Act makes similar provision where an Indian or colonial force is serving with part of the regular air force.In the case of a mixed military and air force, it is desirable that the power of issuing general orders should be vested in the officer commanding the mixed force, whether a military officer or an air force officer. This clause makes the necessary amendment.The clause will not affect the forces of the self-governing Dominions, as the Dominions have all made legislative provision for the government and discipline of their forces.Clause 7.This clause makes amendments in the Army Act and the Air Force Act which are consequential on the introduction of a new rank of brigadier in substitution lor the present ranks of colonel commandant and colonel on the staff.As the substituted rank will come into operation throughout the Army on the same day, it is necessary that the amendments effected by the clause should come into operation simultaneously in all parts of the world.Clause 8.The Army Act and the Air Force Act contain various references to warrant officers not holding honorary commissions.   There are not, and never have been,

Up to 1886, there were a few such officers in the Indian departments; but there have not been any since 1886.References therefore to such officers are obsolete and misleading, and it is proposed by this clause to repeal them.41
