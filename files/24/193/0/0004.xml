Printed for I lie Cabinet.    February 1028.SECRET.-CP. 5d (28).Relations with Afghanistan.(Reference CP. 3-1 (28).).. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Appended to the note on Relations with Afghanistan circulated with my memorandum of the Sth February (CP. 31 (28)) were two telegrams inviting the further observations of th* Government of India on certain points. I now circulate the Government of India&apos;s replies.As regards the question of a cash subsidy, I have formed a clear opinion that it should be decided that in no circumstances will we give one. Besides the practical objections that a subsidy might be devoted to objects highly detrimental to British interests, that no conditions restricting those objects could probably be enforced in practice (lor the subsidy could not be withheld without something like a breach in diplomatic relations), and that once embodied in a treaty the subsidy would be taken by the Afghans for granted and merely used as a junvping-off ground for further concessions, there are the most weighty objections in principle, which could be explained to the Afghans. Subsidies do not enter into the relations of fully sovereign independent States, and the payment of cash by one State to auother, except for some definite return, is financially unsound and altogether indefensible. In the past we received aquid pro quo from Afghanistan in the form of control of her foreign relations; but now we ask for nothing from Afghanistan except the ordinary facilities and courtesies that a civilised State accords to its neighbours for nothing.The general objections are powerfully reinforced by special considerations arising out of the receipt by the Afghans of a subsidy from Russia. The Government of India, after examining the alternatives available if in the last resort the principle of a cash subsidy is accepted, arrive at the conclusion that the only form of subsidy that could be considered is a subsidy fixed without consideration of, or relation to, the subsidy paid by Russia. But it would be a departure from the policy of the past to pay any British subsidy to Afghanistan while she receives one from a Russia avowedly hostile to us. Whether it is expedient to emphasise this to the Afghans is a question of tactics which it is difficult to answer in advance. But there is certainly a risk that if any hint were given to the Afghans that, the receipt of a subsidy from Russia is an obstacle (even though only one obstacle among niauy) to the grant of a British subsidy, the Afghans would read into it or profess to do so an implied promise to grant a subsidy if and when  the Russian subsidy was dropped, and it might be very difficult to avoid drifting into the position of having to grant a subsidy as large as, or larger than the Russian subsidy and conditional, in effect  if not in terms, on Afghan relations with Russia. The objections to such a conditional subsidy are forcibly stated by the Government of India, and described by them as fatal.Absolute refusal to consider the grant of a cash subsidy involves possible risks in two directions, firstly, of the diversion of Afghan policy into more pro-Russian and anti-British channels, and, secoudly, of reaction on the position of King Amanulla in Afghanistan itself in the event of his returning from his tour without having any sufficient concrete results to show. These risks we should have to face. So far as the second goes, it, is not thought likely that a new regime in Afghanistan would be less friendly to us than the present one.As regards the matters dealt with in the Government of India&apos;s telegram No. 355 S., I need refer only to the fourth. The other three are of relatively minor importance, and need not be further pursued at present. In regard to the question of Russian Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan, the Government of India adhere to their previous views ; but without in auy way questioning the views of the Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province as to the undesirability from the local administrative
point of view of having a Russian representative; at Jalalabad, 1 remain of opinion that greater weight must be attached to the broader considerations set out on pages 5 and 6 of the note circulated with my memorandum of the Sth February, and suggest that His Mnjesty&apos;s Government should adhere accordingly to the line of policy laid down in that note.India Offiok,20th February 192$. BIRKENHEAD.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of Stale forIndia, dated loth February 1928.333 S. Your telegram No. 309. We are very loth to contemplate possibility of reversion to old cash subsidy system, ami feel that, if we set our face against any suggestion of it from outset, and at same time evince our disposition to generosity otherwise, chances of Afghan Government making it a case of Great Britain or Russia or -tine qua non of friendly relations ought to be slight. If, however, matters are really forced to this pitch, we realise we may not in the last resort bo able to afford to adhere to attitude of blank negation. \Ve analyse the two forms a regular cash subsidy might take thus: 1. Subsidy conditional on Afghanistan receiving none from Russia. Apart from the financial objections on the score of size, there are. two fundamental objections to this, either of which seems fatal: (a) It would embody auction in its crudest, form and be a standing encouragement for Afghanistan to blackmail us into raising our iigure and to tempt Russia into buying us out; (6) evasion of the conditions would be easy, proof of some forms of evasion impossible and constant friction over the question of fulfilment inevitable. Even as it is, though Russian subsidy of million roubles has been in force for seven years, we only know for certain of one or two instances in which cash has actually passed hands, most of the subsidy having been devoted to supplying material and personnel. Thus, even under conditions in which neither side has any apparent reason for camouflage, but rather the reverse, we have found it extremely difficult to discover whether any particular Russian aid has been gratuitous or charged to the subsidy account. In the circumstances we are now postulating, ascertainment of the facts would be far more difficult, the presentation of proof, even in favourable cases, hardly feasible and in most eases quite impossible. Xo doubt, if our stipulation were that there should be no aid from Russians whatsoever, whether in the form of a cash subsidy or an occasional lump sum or in kind, then evasion would obviously be less easy, and our position in this regard more satisfactory. But we believe that such a stipulation, except during some period of acute tension between Afghanistan and Russia, or possibly as part of an Afghan manoeuvre to set auction going, or to make mischief between Russia and ourselves, is wholly outside the region of practical politics, and dangerous for us even to moot.2. Cash subsidy without reference or relation to the Russian subsidy. Even here the element of auction would not be wholly absent. For, however detached the attitude we sought to adopt in its fixation, comparison with the Russian figures would lie on the surface during the discussions leading up to it. Once fixed, however, the auction would be over for the term of the currency of the Treaty. Rut though such a subsidy would have some advantage as a steadying influence generally, and might prove a welcome lever in times of trouble (for we cannot always hope to have an Afghan consignment of arms to hold up as in the 1\)2&apos;6 crisis), it would, of course, suffer from all the grave disadvantages inherent in the grant of a subsidy, one of which we laid stress on in our previous telegram. It is only in the last resort that we could consider it.There are two other ways in which cash might be given.3. Periodical cash gifts of unspecified and varying size at unspecified and varying, intervals. This would have some of the advantages of a subsidy in kind. The element, of irregularity and uncertainty might help to invest the giver with some merit for each gift, and to inspire the recipient to earn another dole by another bout of good behaviour, it would indeed have one advantage over some forms of a subsidy in kind in that it would be free from that element of schoolmasterly interference in
his internal affairs which the Amir seems to fear would be inseparable either in fact or public opinion from our active participation in Kabul Road project. But, as an institution or form of subsidy, such irregular cash gifts would be demoralising. Their irregularity and uncertainty would debar them from any place in any attempt at a financial system ; they would lead to insistent beggiug if not blackmail, which would make our Ministers position unenviable, and lower the standard of our relations; and our money might, be frittered away or go to support objects against our interests.4. Cash gifts, not as an institution, but once in a way on some very special occasion. Given proper occasion (e.g. another tribal rising), when the Amir was obviously hard pressed and some signal sign of our support might help to stabilise him, a sum of money might conceivably prove the best form for our assistance to take.   But such occasions would necessarily be rare.Our conclusion is that, while recognising possible advantages of varying a subsidy in kind by a single cash present on some extraordinary occasion, we remain definitely opposed to principle of a cash subsidy. But if circumstances really force us to it, we are prepared, in the last resort, to consider a definite annual subsidy fixed without consideration or relation to subsidy from Russia.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 16th February 192$.35f) S. Your 317. As regards (1), we are still examining the possibility of granting &quot; Barcelona &quot; rights in respect of goods (other than munitions of war) in genuine transit. The absence of through rail communication, however, will make it necessary to have special conditions to preveut fraudulent abuse. I3ut on c onsideration, we agree that it would not be desirable to make the concessions conditional on friendly behaviour. As regards concessions beyond these, we still incline to advise that they be made so conditional. After all. it is only five years since we had to hold up the Afghan arms consignment (providentially in India) and were searching round for other possible levers to make Afghanistan realise the gravity of letting matters between us drift still further. Had it been then possible for us under the Treaty, while refraining from stopping the actual transit of trade aoods, to bring pressure to bear on the individual traders by insisting on the ordinary customs from them, we should probably have been well advised to do so. Wo hope that the J923 conditions will not recur, but we must not shirk lacing the possibility of it. Should they recur, we are unlikely to have any arms to withhold, and shall be glad of any pressure the Treaty enables us to apply.2. Our formula was meant, to cover unadministered as well as administered territory. For though we recognise the limitations on our powers we thiuk that we could and should bring sufficient pressure on our tribesmen in big cases to get the Afghan criminals removed from near the Afghan border, and it is chiefly in the big cases that Afghanistan would be likely to apply to us. We recognise that we may have serious difficulty sometimes. But the fact that tribesmen would know that they were up against Afghanistan as well as ourselves would facilitate our task, to say nothing of the Afghan outlaw&apos;s own fears of assassination while in tribal territory at oflicial Afghan instigation.3. Our reservation with regard to machine guns is based on plain military grounds, for our military advisers do not wish to facilitate the acquisition of such weapons by Afghanistan, and we cannot altogether ignore all possibility of Afghanistan being ranged against us, and we are reluctant to expose our troops to possible risk of coming under fire of automatic weapons similar to those with which they are themselves armed and supplied by us. Explanations appear hardly necessary, but if any have to be given we suggest that the Afghans be told that we have none to spare.-i. While we are not wedded to any particular form of making our meaning clear to Afghanistan, we remain strongly of opinion that we cannot afford to abandon our insistence on the exclusion of Russian Consulates from south-eastern zone. Wo have consulted our frontier administrations afresh, and our previous conclusions have received strongest possible confirmation from views (vide our immediately succeeding telegram) of Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province, who is chiefly concerned.
We realise, of course, that our position in the treaty discussions with Afghanistan would be much stronger if we could divest ourselves entirely of any indication of anxiety on the score of Russia or indeed on other scores. I3ut this tactical advantage would be clearly bought at the expense of gravely increased cause for anxiety owing to the presence of Russian representatives on our borders.Our suggestion that we should remove Consulate stipulation from treaty papers was based largely on a desire to consider Afghan susceptibilities, and should Afghans prefer its insertion we would, of course, not seek to (? omission). What we have in mind is a general interpretative letter illustrating in non-schoolmasterly style the meaning we attach to unfriendly behaviour, explaining that we are not thinking of minor incidents, but provocative and dangerous course of action such as interference with our tribesmen by grant of allowances or otherwise or admission of Russian Consulates and other personnel on our borders.With all desire to reshape our opinion in the light of considerations advanced, we are convinced that balance of opinion lies in the course we recommended.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, elated ](jth February P.J28.356 S. Reference to our immediately preceding telegram, No. ooo S. Following from North-West Frontier Province, .11th February:  &quot;Russian Consulates. Views expressed in my letter referred to by you are strongly held by me, and have been reinforced by subsequent experience. Evidence of Bolshevik intrigue with our tribes is steadily accumulating, but assumiug that King disapproves of this, there are obvious difficulties in carrying it on from Kabul. Presence of important AFridi and Mohmand tribesmen there can hardly pass unnoticed, and, if Afghan intermediaries are employed, only small proportion of money reaches tribes. These tiibos, however, constantly visit Jalalabad, and a Russian Consul there would have no difficulty in establishing direct relations with them. It can hardly be coincidence that payment of so-called arrears of allowance to Afridis coincided more or less with recent visit of Stark to Jalalabad, and he is known to have interviewed and paid Maulvi Bashahr. Establishment of Russian Consulate at Jalalabad would be regarded by tribes as definite set-back for us and victory for Russians, and would greatly encourage and strengthen element, hostile to us. From the point of view of administration, such an event would greatly increase difficulties of dealing with tribes,, and might well prove disastrous.&quot;
