Up to that time the only form of poor law relief which did not oarry disfranchisement was medical or surgical assistance, as defined in the Medieai Relief Disqualification Removal JLot, 1885, namely:-&quot;All medical and surgical attendance, end all matters end things supplied by or on the recommendation of the medioal officer having authority to give such attendance end recommendation at the expense of any poor rate.&quot;The following figures show that w^persons in receiptof poor law relief tit various dates,^figure for the lastpre-war year being added as a basis of comparison.Dec. 1913 632,242 June 1921     1,299,086Deo. 1918        455,747 Dec. 1921     1,375,982*Deo. 19 Zv 567,909 Dec 1924     1,071,945Dec 1925     1,324,314Dec 1927     1,236,245It is true that 1913 was a year of comparativeprosperity, but the level of pauperism as measured by the figuresof poor relief was not substantially lower then in the precedingComparableye pr s.

There has been su.bstant-i.elly no fall from the figure then reached, though unemployment in Jainary 1928. vras little more than half as great as in July 1921.    In London pauperism is now nearly as high as in 1921-1922 when employment was definitely bad.In the appendix to this paper will be found statistics showing the proportion of electors who voted In Guardians&apos; Elections in London in 1925o    It will be noted that the proportion is highest in these unions where it Is reasonable to suppose that disqualification on the ground of receipt of poor relief would be most prevalent.The policy of successive Governmentshas been directly to provide means other than those of the poor law for the assistance of particular forms of misfortune, and also to apply tho policy recommended by the Hoyai Commission on the Poor Laws of preventing the occurrence of destitution rather than of relieving it when it has cootrtxad.nevertheless tho proportion of paupers whose pauperism is not associated with real or pretended unemployment hay risen in England and wales from 215 to 234 per 10,000 acd in London from 291 to 336 per 10,000 and it 13 impossible to ascribe any very substantial part of these increases to tae extension of tho hospital work ox the Guardians. - A
the centralisation of relief charges in Londonthrough the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund ha3 no doubt a lareffect upon the amount of London Pauperism.     But this is a purely London arrangement ana it is difficult toattribute the increase in the country at large to any oftho factors so far specified.   The restriction ofunemployment benefit, of which oo much is made by theGuardians, in not material (except in so far as the paymentof benefit has created an appetite for public assistance),cince this benefit practically did not exist in 1913.Tho only other considerable factor which remains to explain the position is the enfranchisement of the pauper, and particularly the right given to him to vote for the Guardians by whom ms applications have been or will be considered.Enfranchisement affects the position in three ways.   The first, though probably not the most important, is the direct corruption of the electorate.   In an appreciable number of areas &quot;Vote for...... and more relief&quot;is now hardly a caricature of many election addresses.In the second place, enfranchisement is breaking down the oil dislike to application to the Guardians.   This is espeoially the oase since, without disfranchisoment, there iB little peroeptible difference in many areas between applying for unemployment benefit and applying for poor relief.   A oase was recently cited to me in which engine-drivers, the aristocrats of the artisan world, being temporarily unemployed, had no hesitation in making such applications, in lieu even of making use of credit resources which were available to them.   In this case a particularly strong Clex-k to the Guardians persuaded the men to withdraw their applications, but there are many other cases of the same kind.In
&apos;    109In the third place - and it is here that the effect of enfrachisement seems to &quot;be most marked -Guardians in considering any application for relief, or any general proposal for the improvement of administration, do so with one eye on the coming elections, in which their attitude is likely to he exploited by their opponents.   This regard of consequences is by no means confined to the Labour Party.    It at least equally characterises the more conservative side, whose representatives are generally less able, and less well organised, than their opponents.Tho extent to which elections may be influenced by the votes of paupers has been tested in a small numberof populous unions, with the following resultsUnion Pronortion of voters who hjyvs;.J^.eJ/vedvsllox&quot; oTh^r^t-han relAaf^on^acoou-rj of sVoxnerso &apos;x:\ six months.Birmingham 1 in 17Bolton 1 in 24Bristol 1 in 14Edmonton 1 in 24Manchester 1 in 12Nottingham 1 in 11Shoreditch 1 in   8Southwark 1 in   8Average 1 in 14In the really rural areas pauperism Is now less than it was before the war, and the proportion of voters who have received relief would be far Bmaller.The view of the importance of the pauper franchise to which this survey of the main factors at work has led ha3 been confirmed by many conversations with the Clerks to important Boards of C-uardians and with other leading poor law officers.    In no case has such an officer suggested that
the effect of this enfranchisement has been negligible. It is further confirmed by repeated resolutions passed at conferences of my General Inspectors, who are officers in actual contact with the Boards of Guardians and with the course of local administration.The facts so far stated seem to me to Indicate that there is a case for a measure of disfranchisement in respect of Guardians&apos; elections.It will be remembered that the Majority of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws reported that one of the leading defects of the Poor Law system was the tendency of candidates to make lavish promises of out relief and of Guardians to favour their constituents in its distribution. This criticism was made at a time when the receipt of poor law relief other than medical relief involved disqualifica-tion.     It has much greater force when applied to a system under which the person in receipt of assistance is empowered to vote at elections for those who will be responsible for its distribution.Much of the argument in this paper might be held to extend beyond its immediate purpose and to apply to general disf rat: chi seme nt and not merely to disf ranchisement at the elections of Guardians.     Indeed the view of my Inspectors and of the poor law authorities who have been coiisulted would extend to general disfranchlsenent,     I am, however, by no means convinced that there is any necessary connection between pauperism and disfranchisenent for general. * purposes, and it is clear that the case for disfranchisement at the Guardians&apos;  elections is much stronger, more obvious, and more direct.It
-2-passed l.y both councils would mean the re-opening of the whole question with no heps ox success.4.    Although I took him point by point through all our objections with every possiblo argument, (? gp. omt.) adhered to his position and it was   . evident that anxious though he undoubtedly was to settle he was not prepared to attempt the impossible as far as draft notes were concerned.     He finally offered to alter proposed instructions to repara-. ticn commissioner end a lengthy discussion led to his offering to pre vide for British cl earns only an initial sun of pounds 15,000 payable withi.i one month of exchange of notes and a further pounds 15,CCO payable within four months after the first payment, the understanding being that a provision for proportional distribution amongst interested Powers (which he thought would be unworkable in practice) would disappear and that these sums would be used at our discretion for payment in first instalment of assessed claims of two British widows,.     He also egreed that in cases of disagree^ ment between the two commissioners there should be reference to an arbitrator of a nationality not interested in the incident, to be chosen by the mutual consent of the two commissioners.5.     He (? gp. omt,) that he personally had done everything possible to make the manner of the return of Kis Majesty&apos;s Consul General and my visit to Nanking; testify to the sincerity of his govern-ment?s desire for a rapprochement,     Hs hadprocured/
It has to be borne in mind too that the poor lav? reform proposals contemplate the transference of poor law administration from the Guardians to the Municipal authorities.      If the disfranchisement of the pauper in the Guardians1 elections has already been carried out, dis-franchisement in liunicipal Elections would follow logically on the transference to Municipal Authorities of the Guardians&apos; functions.     Conversely, if no steps are taken now to disfranchise the pauper for Guardians&apos; elections, it would be a matter of very great difficulty to introduce that disf ranchisement for Municipal elections when the change takes place.     On the other hand, if it were found that the pauper franchise is not so substantial an element in the increase of relief as we have thought, there would be no difficulty in allowing the rr.atter to drop, when the poor law reform proposals are made public.In these circumstances I submit that a measure of disfranchisement of paupers so far as Guardians&apos; elections are concerned and with due provision for the protection of cases of such real misfortune as disability by mental or physical sickness is urgently required.II.
