(This document is the property of His Britannic !fajesty&apos;s Government).As was agreed should be done last week, I have had an alternative draft of the Franchise Bill prepared limited to the equalisation of the franchises of men and women and now circulate   it to ray colleagues.     Jfo point of serious controversy is likely to arise on the present draft except in respect of the provisions which give a second vote  in respect of a &quot;business premises&quot; qualification acquirer! through the voter&apos;s husband or wife  (clause 1  (1)   (c) and clause 4). This will no doubt be strongly opposed by the Labour party. The figures to be inserted in c]ause 6 of the Biin for the new scale of expenses at Parliamentary elections are left blank for the Cabinet&apos;s decision, but a calculation has been made in my Department that a rate of &amp;i-d. per elector in Cotmties and 4d. in Boroughs will, on the increased electorate, produce the same amount as the sevenpenny and fivepenny rates prodtice on the present electorate.      I suggest, therefore, that these rates, 5:&quot;rd. for Counties and 4d. for Boroughs,  should be included in the Bill.C A B I II 3 T.CP.59  (28)5--QK-.T.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.W.J.H.28th February,  1928.
