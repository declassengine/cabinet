DOCUMENT IS THIS PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT).1.     With reference to the Memorandum by the Minister of Health (C.P.64 (28)), I concur generally in the views strted therein aa to the case for a reduction in the Bub3idy.     I desire, however, to offer some observations on the housing situation in Scotland and to submit proposals as regards the reduction in subsidy applicable to Scotland.2.     The statutory provisions on the subject set forth in paragraph 1 of the ITemory-ndun by the Minister of Health apply also in Scotland.3.    In consequence of the unsatisfactory position of housing in Scotland and the slow progress that had been made with the provision of the necessary houses, the Cabinet decided that at the time when the reductions referred to in paragraph 2 of the Memorandum by the Minister of Health were made for England, no corresponding reductions should be -made in Scotland.     It will, however, be necessary when the statutory review is made after 1st October, 1928, to include Scotland in that review, and to determine whether, and if so to what extent, a reduotion in the subsidy now p&amp;yablc in Scotland is to be made.4.     The situation in Scotland has improved considerably sinoe this matter was under consideration in 1926 in respect that since then the annual output of houses has increased very materially.     But the state of matters is still very unsatisfactory.     The shortage of houses to-day is probably not any less than it was in 1919 when the local authorities estimated it at 131,000.     The output of houses sinoe that date has been insufficient to permit of any reduction in the shortage. Indeed for the period up to the end of 1925, the number of houses provided was not sufficient to meet the ordinary normal demands (except in the year 1922 when a small number over the estimated normal annual requirement of 10*000 houses was available towards a reduotion in shortage).     In 1926, however, matters had definitely begun to improve, and in that year nearly 15,000 houses were provided with and without assistance, 5,000 therefore being available towards reduction of shortage.     In 1927, 22,000 were similarly provided, giving 12,000 towards reduotion of shortage.     If the output of 1927 can be maintained for a few years, the housing situation will be considerably rolieved, and I am anxious that as far as reasonably practicable, with due regard to the needs of the Exchequer, nothing should be done which will have tho effect of diminishing this output.5.     I am, however, of opinion that a reduction in the present rates of subsidy payable in Scotland can be justified when the revision is due in October next.     Since october, 1926, there has been a steady fall in building costs, and the following table of prices may, for the purpose of comparing the fall in prices, be contrasted with the table given in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum by the MiniBter of Health.   In this connection I should explain that the description &quot;parlour&quot; and &quot;non-parlour&quot; does not obtain in Scotland^ the houses being graded according to the ruimber- o-f erpaxtments and type., i.e., flatted,P.68 (28).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Soqtland.Reconsideration of Housing Subsidy.CABINET.cottage/

It seems clear, therefore, that a roduction in subsidy in Sootland can be justifiod on the basis of a fall in building costs, provided always that no increase in pricee takes place between now and 1st October, 1928, when the costs for tho two years preceding that ate and the anticipated oosts for the following two years fall to be eviewed by the Minister of Health and the Soottieh Board of Health. Everything meantime points to a continuation of the downward trend of rices.7.     In view   of the fall in building oosts and in tho hope that hat will oontinue, I would propose, when the revision takes place fter 1st Ootober, 1928, that, so far as Sootland iB conoerned, eductions in subsidy equivalent to thoso already imposed in England hould take effect as from the date to be fixed in the Order to be ,hen isBuod,     These reductions are from  6 to  4 per house per annum for 20 years in the oase of the Act of 1923 and from  9 to  7:10/-*in rural areas from  12:10/- to  11) in the case of the Act of 1924,8.     These reduood subsidies would therefore bo payable until he next review comes to be made after 1st October, 1930, and, as ogards the reduotion for England and Wales now proposed by the $mater of Health of  50 in all subsidies, I should like to enter a aveat that, when the next revision period (after 1st October, 1930,) rives, my aoceptance at this time of reductions similar to those iposed upon England and Walss at the last revision period shall &apos;t be held to involve an automatic acceptance of reductions similar o those now proposed by the Minister of Health for England and Wales. In view of the statutory provieions as to revision of subsidy, it ia jerhaps unnecessary to enter such a caveat, but in view of the T-fficultieB and peculiarities of Soottish housing. I feel bound to j^-oate that it might bo impossible to impose in Scotland in 1930 pen reduotions, and I desiro to keep the position open.
9.     As regards the date from whloh any proposed reduction should take effeot, I am in agreement with the Minister of Health that there ehould not be much difficulty in getting the oonsent of looal authorities to 1st Ootober, 1929, as that date, but I am inclined to take the view that, in negotiating with the looal authorities on this question, it would be better to name 31st March, 1929, as a first offer instead of 31st December, 1928, as proposed by the Minister of Health.      I am of opinion, however, that whatever date is put forward or ultimately agreed to should be uniform for both-countries as regard a-tbe respective reductions in subsidy proposed to be imposed.tJOKN GILMOUR&apos;.cottish Offioe, Whitehall, S.W.1,5th March, 1928.
