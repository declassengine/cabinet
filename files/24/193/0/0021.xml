:.S D0CUM2NT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJgSTY^S QOVSRS-SIIT) . jj; R B..T. COPY NO. ____CABINET, THS PALEST IKS LOAN, Memorandurn by tbg Lord l^oftldent,pf, the Council.I understand that the question of assisting the Zionist policy in Palestine by a foan, negotiated through the League of Nations or otherwise, is certain to come before the Cabinet in the immediate future.   If this bo so,- I hope ny colleagues will forgive me if I trouble them with a short memorandum on the subjecteBy the Peace Treaty we are pledged, among other tilings, to place Palestine &quot;under such economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home&quot;, and In particular we are to / &quot;enccrur-age (in co-operation with the Jewish Agency) close settlement of Jews cn the land including state lands and waste lands not required for public purposes&quot;o     Article VI of the Mandate.I am not 30 sure as I should like to be that an impartial examination into all that has occurred since 1920 would shew that we have carried out these obligations in a very generous spirit.     But I quite recognise that the difficulties were great, and that, in addition to difficulties in Palestine, there were difficulties at home which necessarily hampered our mandatory administration in its early years *Circumstances, however, have greatly changed since 1920. In that year it might be alleged with some plausibility that,-1-
although Palestine is but the smallest of notches exit out of the vast territories restored to the Arabs by British arms, the establishment of a Jewish Hone in Palestine has nevertheless inflicted an injury on its Arab population.     That argument,  I take it, has lost its force, since the economic development of Palestine has manifestly conferred immense benefits on every section of the community and has deprived them of nothing.     Again it might have been urged in 1920 that the financial burden thrown upon the Mandatory Power by the Treaty mu3t prove excessive.     As a matter of fact,  the main financial burden involved in the transformation of Palestine has been borne by Jews, and largely by Jews who are not British citizens^     British services from an administrative and defensive point of view have indeed been inestimable. But in the shape of hard cash they have been small0Compare the cases of Palestine and Iraq.     Since 1920 Iraq has been relieved of tho debt for military administra-tion during the war.      Palestine - a country far smaller and poorer - has been required to re--imburse a part of such expenditure,     Since the war the vast areas which we and our allies relieved from Turkish rule have not beon required to bear any share of the Ottoman Debt.     To this general policy there is one exception, and that exception ia Palestine.     Far from being tho spoilt child of the mandatory system Palestine has been its CinderellanSo much for vhst the Mandatory Power has done for Palestine,,      Now considsr the other aide of the question, and ask what Palestine as a mandated territory is doings and may do,  for Britain and the British Empire *Consider this question,  in the first placo, from the most general point of view.      It will not, I think, be
sodenied that what our Colonial Empire, including its mandated territories, suffers from mo3t at the present time is lack of money and lack of settlers.     V7e are responsible for an enormous fraction of the earth&apos;a surfacec     V,&quot;e know how to protect it from external aggression and internal disorder;    our administration is pare and efficient j   we are applying with increasing success, the results of economic and medical research,, But in many districts we want money, and in others yre want the right kind of immigrants.     In the case of Palestine alone is there a supply of both;   but the supply has not been provided by Britain.     The supply of money is due to Jewish idealism.;    the supply of immigrants is due to Jewish idealism combined with Jewish misery.The facts are roughly these.      Since the mandate made Britian responsible for Palestine, at the very least, twelve million sterling has been poured into that small country-     This aggregate i3 being added to at the rate cf about  700,000 a year from official Zionist funds alone, apart from other public funds and private investments,,     This rate moreover tends apparently to increase rather than diminish,.     During the same period immigrants have been added to the population.Palestine is being transformed,     Who have transformed it, and who are going to profit by its transformation?     The immediate agents in the great work have been British soldiers,  British officials, Jewish organisers, Jewish subscx-ibers and Jewish setters All these factors have been and are necessary to produce the result;   but it is the last three which differentiate.-3-
the development of Palestine from every other Colonyor mandated territory, and givo it its peculiarcharacter.     3o much for the first question.Take now the second question - who are going toprofit by this development?   Not ^erel&apos;r the jewish immigrants;   but all tho population of Palestineirrespective of race or religion.     For example (leavingreduction out of account)  100,000 a year out of theJewish Fund is being spent on sanitary administration,though the whole community (and not the Jews only)benefit by it.     In other couxitries either no similar work is undertaken, or it is paid for entirely out ofrates and taxes.      In Palestine, and in Palestine alone,while the benefit is general, those whose mone-,r make it possible gain nothing f.&apos;ora it themselves, and are neithercitizens of the territory, nor, broadly speaking, of theEmpire to ^rhorn the territory is mandated.But it would surely be a great mistake tc narrowour views to these direct and obvious result3.      It mustbe a gain to the whole Empire that any one of its constituent part3 should succeed in reaching this greatdevelopment.      Its effects may be indirect.,     They may do nothing, for instance, to relieve the British taxpayer.But indirectly, both morally and materially, its effectsmust be beneficial0And let it be noted that these results would followv.herever Palestine wera situated.     They depend upon general causes, and ere not affected by the accidents oflatitude or longitude.      But Palestine has specialcharacteristics depending on its geographical position which greatly increase its imperial importance..      It liesat the very place where the Po-vor primarily responsiblefor the security of the Sues Canal would wish to place it.I am no pessimist about Egypt;   but who will say that ourposition there at the present moment is wholly satisfactory-4-
A mandated territory on the asiatic side of the groat waterway, prosperous, contented and quite impervious to Egyptian intrigue :nust add strength to the Empire at a point where additional strength may in the interests of the Empire and the world, be most desirable.     This was not n consideration which influenced most British Zionists in 1917.      It certainly did not  influence me;    but the trend of events since then has brought It into prominence, and the idealists - be they Jew or Gentile are serving the international interests of peace and commerce in a way which perhaps they nevar contemplated.If it be asked why an enterprise so generously supported by Jev;s all over the world is in any difficulty about money, the answer is that where capital expenditure is required annual subscriptions rarely meet all the necessities of the case,     Some borrowing Is required;    and although I cannot imagine a better security than the credit of the Zionist Organisation,  supported as it will be by the settlers whom It is intended to benefit, it is a security which may not at first sight commend itself in every respect to a banker or a chartered accountant * It must be considered from the statesman^ point of view; and It is from this point of view that I earnestly hope the Cabinet will deal with it.(Intld)    AJ.B.March 5th, 1928.
