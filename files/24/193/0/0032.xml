I find that the Opinion was given on the 8th April, 1925, in
response to ar. enquiry by yourself dated the 19th JJavoh,1925.      In that enquiry you yourself pointed out thatit was desirable that cession should be confirmed byAct of Parliamentt and you cited the instance ofHeligoland as one in which that procedure was followedjYou will see that in our report we did not state thatthe cession could not taJre plane without statutory authority.     Cur Opinion cn the point was in the.foHewing terms.:-&apos;In our opinion it is constitutionally within the Prerogative of the Crown to cede British territory not forming part of a self-governing Dominion -But we regard it as undesirable that such a Prerogative right should bo exercised without the concurrence of Parliament and we should advise that a&quot;-iy Treaty or Agreement containing such a provision should be submit;&quot;.ed to Parliament for ratification.*I hope this sufficiently answers your question.Yours evers(Signed J DOUCIAS MoGARSL ECGG/e Right _n.cn,L,So Amery, Ii..po2,
