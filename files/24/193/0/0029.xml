1 3&apos;iJL tJ JLFollowlrig for Lord Cushendun,Cabinet Com.-.ir,tec to-day con?.id. red position in regard to fox*thcomi.TG discussions of Preparatory Commission and is submitting following proposals to Cabinet, whose approval or otherwise &apos;.-;ill be notified to you.With regard to Russian propofala K. 13riand&apos;s suggestion is approved, viz: that proposals shotild bo subjected at outset to searching q\;estlons such as are they calculated to prevent not only war between nations but also civil v&amp;r the instigation of which has hitherto been avowed object cf Soviet Government.      In supporting French attitude, re  leave a groat deal to your discretion but in regard to these questions ycu rill of course be careful to avoid using any language which might be construed into implying that Els i-ia jesty &apos;s Government was obstructing reduction in armaments so as to be able to suppress legitimate, labour movement. Russian proposals should then be referred to special Committee for examination and report as suggested in your memorandum W/2173/28/93 of liarch 3rdB     Adjournment of Preparatory Commission is desirable, but British responsibility for seeking such adjournment should If possible tc avoided.      Interval between adjournment and next meeting of Preparatory Commission should be utilised to forward the compromise between France and ourselves In regard to land and sea armaments as outlined in conversation between Sir Austen Chamberlain and ):.

Once case has been pl?.c.:d before the public as a British proposal actual date cf consideration is net cf material importance, provided agr.&apos;jment is reached In such time as v;ill enable proposals ^o become effective before Washington Treaty expires.      In view therefore of American objection discussion as to this date should at the present moment be avoided.If either French or Italians suggest that the ratio allotted to them under the &quot;Washington Treaty Is too low, Admirsltv- entertain no objection to their ratio being raised from 1.7 to 2U     Any suggestion however of this kind must of course emanate from them and net be put forward by vou.The submission to the L..ague of a model statement of expenditure on armaments is agreed to generally in the form proposed by tho Committee of experts. But It should b :* preceded by a sentence as follows &quot;This form is to be used only for tho comparison of one year1s expenditure with Another of each particular Country.&quot;   It cannot be used fcr the purpose of comparing the military, navel and air strengths of different countries.     Besides this certain :r.inor technical amendments are being studied and it is possible we may send them to you if there is still tirr;e.
