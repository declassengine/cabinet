BORET.CABINET.(20) -RACECOURSE BETTIHG BILL.5Memorandum by the Home secretary the Cabinet at ito meeting on Wednesday, the 7th March, decided (Cabinet 15(29) Conclusion S) to leave the decision on Major Glyn&apos;s Betting Bill to a free vote of the House, but I rleniro to bring to the notice of my colleagues a feature of this bill which, as touching the principles and the administration of the criminal law, raises a wider and more important issue than that of legalising the totalisator and requires the most careful conaiderat ion.Under the existing lav; ordinary betting on horse racecourses with bookmakers, provided that the bookmakers do net &quot;localise&quot; themselves by taking up fixed pitches, is not prohibited, as the Street Betting Act of 1903 vmich prohibits betting j.n streets and public places expressly exempts from its scope any grounds &quot;used for the purpose of a racecourse for racing with horses&quot;.      If, however,  bookmakers   &quot;localise&quot; themselves, both they and the proprietors of the racecourse are liable to  ponaltie3   under the Betting Act,  1H5S, which makes it a criminal offence for persons to use or to allow to be used any house, office or place for betting with persons resorting thereto or for receiving ready money bets.     From legal decisions it appears that if bookmakers do not make use of a permanent stand or have no special place, they are not using a &quot;place&quot; within the meaning of the Act of 18*55 and neither they nor the proprietors of the racecourse are committing an offence under that Act.The existing provisions of the law accordingly make the use of a totalisator on racecourses illegal.The object of iiajor Glyn&apos; s Bill is twofold:-(l) To legalise the use of the totalisator on horse racecourses on racing days.
(2) To enable the proprietors of a horse racecourse to charge a special fee to bookmakers and to allocate a part of the ground to thorn.These objects can best be achieved by removing horse racecourses on racing day3 from the scone of the Betting Act:?, and provided that all horse racecourses are dealt with on oimiiar lines, there is much to be said in favour of this proposal.iiajor Glyn&apos;s Bill, however, j.3 limited to races held under the rules of the Jockey Club and the Jational Hunt Commitee or both of these bodies, one of the objects being to prevent the use of totalisa.tors at what are called &quot;flapping meetings&quot; which are attended by owners and others who have been warned off the turf for various reasons.     The objections to this limitation are so great as to outweigh any possible advantages to be derived from it.To differentiate between one type of horse race meeting and another would, be interpreted and criticised as a piece of class legislation and would be giving preferential treatment to certain racecourses.     At present the law does not discriminate between racecourses:    thus for example the Street Betting Act, 1903, exempts all horse racecourses alike from its operation.The main and conclusive objection to the limitation proposed in the Bill is that it would introduce a radical alteration in the private.ncj.ples and administration of the criminal law.     Under the Bj.ll as drafted a method of betting would be lawful at races held under the rules of the Jockey Club or the national Hunt Committee but would be a criminal offence elsewhere.     Moreover a method of betting which would be legal on a racecourse in April might be illegal on the same racecourse in June, for either of these bodies could,  by simply withdrawing its   sanction from the racecourse, convert a lawful act into a criminal offence.     To make the criminal law dependent on the unregulated decisions of such private bodies as the Jockey Club or the National Hunt Committee, which are in no way recognised by statute, would be a novel departure which,
1 o r10 th March, 1920.as Home Secretary, i could nob defend in the House of Commons. It would in my view be wholly wrong in private.nci.ple to allow corporations for private profit to grant an exemption fro&quot; the criminal law.     The offence would in effect become betting on racecourses without the consent of one or both of these unofficial bodies.     Every time the police had occasion to take proceedings for unlawful betting on a racecourse they would have formally to prove to the Court that the particular meeting did not enjoy the patronage of either or both of these boclios and it would be clear to everyone that that fact alone and not anything unlawful or mischievous per se constituted the gravamen of the charge.     Such a state of affairs could not fai 1 to bring tho criminal lav; into contemnt in the eyes of large numbers of perfectly respectable and sensible people.In view of these objections i strongly urge my colleagues that if the Bill obtains a Second Reading an amendment should be moved by the Government deleting the provision limiting the scope of the Bill to races under the auspices of these two bodies and i hope that some indication may be gi.ven during the Second Reading debate that such an amendment will be moved by the Government in Standing Committee if the House gives the Bill a Second Reading.W.J .11.
