Draft Telegram to Lord Lloyd circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for consideration at their meeting tomorrow.Your telegram No. 156 (of 9th March).I agree generally with your suggestions.Modification of the electoral lay/ may very probably prove inevitable.     Such a modification might conceivably be of advantage both to Egypt, as making more possible some improvement in the standard of administration, and to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as promoting the.chann^e of the treatyfs eventual acceptance.    You will recollect, however, that in the note conveying the declaration of February 1922 to the Sultan it was laid doY/n that &quot;the creation of a Parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible government is a matter for Your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine&quot;.     This formal dis-avowal on our part of responsibility may prove to have both advantages and disadvantages at the present juncture.     But the fact remains that we shall be attacked as responsible for whatever constitutional changes may take place, and I share your view that great circumspection on our part is called for. It is important, therefore, that as little open and direct responsibility shall be incurred as is possible in the circumstances.returned to the foreign office if not required for official use.]3 6
I further agree generally with your outline of policy towards any government which succeeds Sarwafs.    You are of course right in wishing that issue should be joined with them upon matters which not only fall within the scope of the declaration of 1922, but so affect foreign interests as to make us the champion and secure us the good will of foreign powers.     Of these the first is the maintenance of law and order, and the protection oi life and property and it is here that we could best    take our stand.With regard to more purely British interests great caution will be necessary.     The maintenance of the London Office, for instance, is comparatively a detail and we cannot have it said that we had acquiesced in the suppression of Egypt&apos;s Constitution merely for the sake of promoting British Commercial interests. Questions of this nature can I think be besfc   settled after major issues have been dealt v/ith.     T^e Egyptian State Railways, again, afford little justi-fication for drastic intervention at present.     The a.uestion of officers in the Frontier Districts Administration more nearly fulfills the necessary con-dition bUu is not as clear or overwhelming a case as I should wish.     Deterioration in the ports and lights adraini strati on, on the other hand, in so far as it causes a clear danger to international shipping, would afford solid greund for remonstrance.     I observe, more-over, that you make no reference to the 1855 loan. Here,   intervention on our port now seems warranted,seeing/
Hseeing that we jgave a good case in equity;   since the British taxpayer is now bearing the burden of Egypt&apos;s failure to meet the obligation.    Moreover Sarwat Pasha assured me more than once that this question should be settled shortly.     But perhaps the most favourable ground for intervention on behalf of our own inter-ests would be afforded by Egyptian recalcitrance in the matter of our air communications, if and v/hen it is displayed.     I do not think, however, that it is possible to do more than give you these general indications of my views at this moment, since so much must depend upon the circumstances of the moment.I agree with you that, taking the long view, it would be wiser not to oppose the assumption of office by a purely Wafd Ministry, although I appreciate the risks to which you dray/ attention.    A &quot;mixed&quot; or v/holly non-Wafd government v/ould be less convenient, but I see no reason why our attitude should be modified by the political complexion, or the lack of it, of the incoming Ministry.     In any event, I agree that it v/ould be undesirable to address to them any warning beyond that already given which was designed to accord you as free a hand as possible.     The foregoing para-graph would not of course apply were Sidky, for example, to come forward with an offer to form a government which would see the treaty through.     This would create a new situation requiring consideration on its merits.As/
As to your own attitude in the immediate future, I am inclined to think that one of reserve is the most suitable,,     The Egyptians have chosen to place themselves in their present situation, and it is for them to get cut af it as best they can,,     If the process Involves dissensions and delay, we sesm to stand to lose nothing, while the Wafd^ prestige would hardly be enhanced,,     In the absence of&apos; unexpired-pected developments, therefore, you would do well to stand aside, and avoid committing yourself to advis-ing King Fuad to adopt any particular course.     This, I gather, is your own view and I am in complete agreement with it.As regards the treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government made a most generous offer of settlementB     The Prime Minister of Egypt saw in it a great opportunity for his countryv    His government however refused it as he himself has explained at the bidding of the Wafd.     In all probability therefore it is dead be-cause those who without responsibility for the results of their action have imposed their will on the Cabinet which was nominally responsible for Egyptian policy have obliged that Cabinet to reject it on the ground it does not provide for the complete withdrawal cf the British forces from Egypt3     This is a condition which was refused by the late British Government and which no British Government will or can accept. The treaty stands as the high   water mark of British concession to Egyptian nationality and the contrastbetween/&apos;
between the generosity of its terms and the character of its reception by the Egyptian parliamentary major-rity is one which patriotic Egyptians may well be left to ponder.     It is not to be assumed in the light of this new experience and the lessons which it teaches that His :,:ajesty&apos;s Government will renew the offer or indefinitely hold it open but in our view it would be a mistake immediately to withdraw it.     Let Egypt have a little time for reflection before the Sibylline books are burnt.     Let us keep the Egyptians guessing.FOREIGN OFFICE.12th March 1928.
