Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1928.29SECRET. Copy No.    ^CP. 98 (28).CABINET.THE EMPIRE SETTLEMENT ACT AMENDMENT BILL.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a memorandum prepared in the Treasury in connection with the memorandum [CP. 95 (28) J by the Secretaiy of State for Dominion Affairs on the subject of the private member&apos;s Bill to amend the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, March 20, 1928.Empire Settlement Amendment Bill.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asks the Cabinet to rescind the decision of the 24th February &quot; that the Government could not assent to any Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill.&quot;The principal ai-gument is that certain schemes under the consideration of the Industrial Transference Board in connection with the Mining situation will require the changes proposed by the amendments to the Bill. It will be time to consider such schemes when they are produced; it should not be assumed in advance that they will require amendment of the Empire Settlement Bill.The three principal changes proposed in the Memorandum of the Secretary of State are (a) to allow men to train in this country for agriculture at home as well asoverseas.If there is a case for training men for employment in agriculture at home it should be proposed by the Minister of Agriculture and not by the Secretaiy of State for Dominion Affairs.It is proposed, however, to provide by Act of Parliament for training in agri-culture at home, not because there are any openings for men so trained, for it is admitted that there are few or none, but as a means of attracting more recruits for training, who, it is hoped, when they discover that there are no such openings at home, will consent to go abroad instead. It is much more probable that, sooner or later, the Government would be pressed to provide land settlement schemes, at great expense, in order to make good the expectations which they have held out of agriculture work at home (b) to enable the depondants of men who are being trained to draw allowancesduring the period of training.It is suggested that these amendments would remedy a dofeot in the Act and will enable married men to be trained.   But there is nothing in the present Act[17437]
to prevent the payment of dependants&apos; allowances, provided that a second party is prepared to pay at least 50 per cent, of the cost.(c) To enable the Secretary of State to pay the whole cost of training schemes administered by a Government Department, and three-quarters of the cost if administered by a public authority, or alternatively by any authority, public or private.Once the 50 per cent, stipulation laid down in Section 1 (3) (6) of the Act is abandoned, there is no point at which we shall be able to stop. No estimate is given of the additional cost which may be involved in the proposals. But the liability may be very large. In particular, the figure of  10 given as the additional cost of training a man with a family is regarded as a serious underestimate.This new liability is proposed at a time when the Government is being urged on all sides to refrain from promoting legislation which involves fresh expenditure. There is no guarantee that the training would induce any considerable additional numbers to go overseas. And, if it is argued that at least the trained man will prove a better settler than the untrained, the answer is that in that case the Dominion Government, which stands to gain chiefly, should be prepared to con-tribute towards the cost of such training under the present Act.It is submitted that the proper course is that the Government should not accept an ill-considered Private Bill and endeavour in great haste to adapt it to their plans, before the latter are matured, but should wait until the Industrial Transference Board&apos;s schemes are before them and then proceed, after due con-sideration, to frame their own proposals.Treasury, March &quot;26, 1928.
