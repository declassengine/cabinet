(THIS D0CUK5MT 13 SHE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAKKIC KAJBSgY&apos;3 GOVl^ItiiEKT).Copy Ho.CRET pABIKET.TM( 20).Reconsideration of Housing Subsidy. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1. Under Section 5 of tho Housing (Financial Provisions)Act, 1924, the Minister and the Scottish board of Health are reqxtired after 1st October 1926 and in each second succeeding year after 1st October in such year to consider the question of the revision of the various subsidies for housing purposes other than the subsidies in connection with slum clearance.The subsidies to which the section refers are -( i)    Those under the Act of 1924 - (which apply to houses which are subject to certain rent conditions) - which were fixed in the Act as(a) In agricultural parishes  12.lo. per house per annum for 40 years.(b) In other places  9 per house per annum for 40 yaexs. (ii)    Under the Aot of 1923 (houses not subject to anyrent condition) fixed in the Act as  6 per house per annum for  0 years.The Statute requires   that the Minister of Health and the Soottish Board of Health shall on the occasion of a revision take into consideration the expenses likely to be incurred in the 2 years following the date of revision, regard being had to the expenses incurred in the previous 2 years.     Following this consideration and after consultation with local authorities the Minister and tho Board may make an Order varying the rates of subsidy.     The Order has to be laid in draft before the House of Commons and cannot take effect until it has been affirmed by resolution.     If the subsidy is varied, the Order providing for the variation may specify a date, and houses completed by that date are to be eligible for subsidy at the rate in foroe before the variation.
2. In accordance with the Act the original rates of subsidy were reviewed in 1926 and in July of that year I submitted to my colleagues oertain proposals for the reduction of the subsidies CP.290(26).    I was authorised to make an announcement of the Government&apos;s general policy beforG the rising of the House in August and in reply to a question on tho 4th August I made the following statement;-&quot;It is tho general policy of the Government to bring to an end the subsidies under the Acts of 1923 end 1924 as soon as practicable, but it is recognised that this can only be done gradually and with sufficient notice to enable locel authorities and those engaged in the building industry to aooommodate themselves to the position, in order to avoid breaking the continuity of house production.      The statutory review under the Aot of 1924 falls to be made after the 1st October next and I cannot at the present time say what reduction of subsidies, if any, may be made by Order under that Act.   Any such Order, however, must be confirmed by resolution of this House before becoming operative.   In the meantime I have decided that houses completed by the 1st October, 1927, will be eligible for the present rate of subsidy&quot;.On the 2nd December, 1926, a Resolution of the House of Commons approved an Order which provided that the following subsidies should be payable in substitution for subsidies at the original rates in respect of houses completed after 1st Ootober, 1927 -(i)(a)  11 (instead of  12.10.0.) per house per annum for40 years.(b)  7.10.0. (instead of  9) per house per annum for 40 years, (ii)  4 (instead of  6) per house per annum for 20 years. The reduction in subsidy was in eaoh case equivalent to a capital sum of  25.
3. In accordance with tho terms of the Act a further review of these subsidies falls to bo made after 1st October of the present year.Apert from tho question of the amount ( if any) of tho reduction in subsidy to be made as tho result of this review it is obvious that local authorities in framing thoir building programmes for the coming season will want to know to what date they can rely on receiving the present rates of subsidy, and it will be necessary that some announoomant of tho Government1s proposals on this point should be made at an early date although the announcement of any proposed reductions in subsidy must be delayed till after the first of october.I have in fact received inquiries on tho subject from a few local authorities, and the Association of Municipal Corporations have passed a Resolution expressing the hope that the existing rates of subsidy will be retained for a further period of two years from next October.4. Tho policy of the Cabinet in authorising the previousrevision of subsidy had three main points -(a) It was felt that a reduction of subsidy would lead to a reduction in housing costs.(b) It was considered that the object to bo aimed at is theabolition of all Exchequer subsidy in aid of house building at the earliest possible moment,    It was felt, however, that, In order to avoid violent discontinuity in building progress, the subsidy should be redvtoed by stages and that complete freedom from subsidy should be obtained after two or three steps.(c) The view was taken that the field available for subsidy oughtto be reduced.     In tho oaso of building by private enterprise, subsidy should bo restricted to cheaper houses whilst tho energies of local authorities should be directed to the provision of the smallest class of dwelling suitable to the means of the least woll paid workers.
5. The announcement of the decision to reduce thesubsidy was followed almost at once by s fall in building costs.The course of prices of non-parlour houses in Locrl Authorities1 tenders has been as follows:-Average price ofnon--oerlour house. -3 months ended December 1926 (Announcement of reduction of subsidy - tfovenber 1926) 4483 months ended Llarch 1927 425&quot;     &quot; &quot;     June, 1927 412&quot;     &quot; &quot;     September, 1927 403&quot;     &quot; &quot;     December, 1927 407The reduction in costs exceeds the reduction in subsidy end this is true after making allowance for the faot that some reduction in the size of houses has been msde.Some success hss also been attained as a result of the efforts mede to concentrate on the provision of smaller houses.     The average size of non-parlour houses in the contracts of local authorities in the 2 quarters ended Soth September, 1927, was 770 square feet as compared with averages of from 709 to 007 square feet in 1926.An indirect effect of the announcement of reduction of subsidy was a tremendous effort on the part of local authorities and private builders to advance their programmes and to secure the completion of every possible subsidy house before the 1st October, 1927, so as to qualify for subsidy at the original rates.     In the result an unprecedented number of houses was completed in the year endod September 1927; Subsidised hoixses completed in that year numbered 212,916 as compared with 131,895 in 1926 and 92,291 in 1925.     The
total number of houses of all classes completed in 1927 reached the extraordinary figure of 273,229.6. As was only to be expected, the acceleration of thebuilding programme in order to take advantage of the old rate .of subsidy has been followed by a period of considerably reduced activity.     The head of construction of subsidy houses has fallen (there were 49,369 subsidy houses under construction at the end of December 1927 as compared with 101,643 at the corresponding date in 1926 end 75,567 in 1925) and local authorities have not as yet shown a disposition to expand their building programme to their former scale.Prom the point of view of the possibility of securing further reductions in building costs this is an excellent thing.     On the other hand it exposes us to the easy criticism that the decline in housing activity since the end of last September is a result of the recuotion of subsidy.     It will no doubt ba said that the reduction of subsidy has had the effect of mailing it Impossible for local authorities to build.     This is quite clearly not true. I have no doubt that local authorities generally do not regard the reduction of subsidy as preventing them from going on;    they recognise the fact that the fell in prices results in their being in no worse position than beforo.     It must be recognised that the rate of construction in 1927 was phenomenal and that the intensive concentration of the last few years on house building has at length resulted in a considerable amelioration of the position.     There is hope that the number of subsidy houses completed this year will reach 100,000, which is considerably in excess of pre-war averages.     We shall d.o well if we oan maintain production at that height.     I should myself oxpeot a gradual decline of ordinary house provision
by local authorities, with, I hope, a growth of greater activity in regard to dealing with 3lums.7. Reviewing the whole situation I find no reason fordeparting from the policy announced in the House last August, that subsidies should be got rid of altogether, but that with r. view to maintaining continuity as far as possible this should be done gradually.I cm therefore of opinion that as the result of the revision to be made after October next there should be a further rediiction, but not a complete withdrawal, of subsidy and the questions to be determined seem to me to be -(a) what should bo the next reduction in subsidy and(b) from what date should it take effeot.     On the last occasion subsidy was reduced by the equivalent of a capital sum of   5-    one could hardly make a smeller reduction and it is necessary to consider when a reduction has been made what will be left and whether it is worth retaining.If a reduction of  25 is made the subsidy remaining under the 1923 Act is equivalent to  25.     For the most part new houses built under the 1923 Act are now houses built by private enterprise and it is clear that the inducement of a  25 subsidy is of very little importance to the private builder and that the increase of building which can be secxired by a subsidy of  25 is negligible.The local authorities took the view e. year ego that the private enterprise subsidy might well be discontinued;    they would say this with greater force now.    and many of them would stress the difficulty now arising of administering the private enterprise scheme and combating abuses.I hardly think that it would be practicable to put a reduction of subsidy simply on the footing of a discontinuance of private enterprise subsidy.     I suggest that an all round reduction equivalent to  5o should be made in all subsidies. This would have the effeot of bringing the 192S subsidies to an
end and would reduce the 1924 Exchequer subsidy to the equivalent of  79.6. As regards the date from which the reduction shouldtake effect it will clearly be difficult to propose that the reduction should take effect from 1st October next or from a date shortly afterwards.In my negotiations with the local euthorities I should propose in the first instance to suggest to them 31st December, 1928, as the date for the reduction of the subsidy,     I have no doubt that this date would meet with strong opposition from the local authorities but I should not anticipate great difficulty in getting their consent to 1st obtober 1929 as the date.     The only formal expression of opinion which I have et present received is a resolution by the Municipal Corporations Association to the effect that the present rates of subsidy should be continued for a period of two years from 1st October next, but I should doubt whether they will maintain this position. 9. Pending negotiations with the local authorities on theamount and date of the reduction in subsidy, it will be necessary to make some announcement to prevent discontinuity in the present year&apos;s programme.       I propose to inform local authorities that they may rely on receiving subsidies at the present rates in respect of all houses completed by 51st December, 1928.Ultimately it will be necessary to discuss with them the question of amoiuit of reduction of subsidy and to make some concession as to the period for which the present rates shall subsist.     I should propose finally to make a subsidy reduction of  50 and I should be prepared tc agree that the existing rates should continue to some date not l&amp;tor then Soth September, 1929.At the same time I should propose by administrative action to conoentrate the efforts of the local authorities as far as possible on the provision of a class of house suitable for the least well paid workers.I shall be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for proceeding on these lines.ebruary, 1928.
