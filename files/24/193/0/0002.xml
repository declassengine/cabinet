o u(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY B   GOVERNMENT). SECRET. COPY NO iCP. 58 (23).0 A B I ij E T .SALAilpS OF COUNTY COURT JUDGES. Note by the Lord Chancellor.I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum which I had prepared proposing an increase in the salary of County Court Judges.Before laying it before the Cabinet, I took the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and learn from him that for reasons based on general financial policy, which I can well understand, he would be unable to accept the proposal.      In these circumstances, I do not propose to press it at the present time.     But I think it desirable that the memorandum should be circulated to inform my colleagues of the situation and for the purpose of record.flour.e of Lords,16th February, 192a,
SALARIES OF COUNTY COURT JUDGES.There arc at present 56 County Coiirt Judges.     Each draws, in addition to his salary, a bonu3 which at the present rate is  186.Gs per annum, making a total in rcspoct of each Judge of  1685.6s. or a gross cor:t in respect of the whole 56 of  94,432.16a.     The-gross cost, if effect be given to my proposal, v/ould be  112,000, or, assuming that bonus continues at Its present rate., a net additional cost of  17,567e4s0I have for some years, during both my first and present Chancellorship, been pressed by the County Court Judges to make a proposal of this nature.     The arguments which they have advanced in favour of It are that the salary was fixed many years ago when the value of money was very different from its present value;   that in the Interval fees at the Bar have increased in an even greater ratio;    that a far higher standard and much longer hours of work are now required of a County Court Judge than were contemplated in earlier years;   and that the legislature has on very many occasions, and particular-ly of recent years, laid upon the County Court Judges additional work and responsibility cf such a nature as almost wholly to change the nature cf the. office., In my opinion, these argument:? are well founded and I must add that, an a result, I find an increasing difficulty in selecting from the Bar, within a range of age appropriate to the holding of the . posit Ion.,
candidates suitable to discharge with efficiency the duties Parliament now required of a County Court judge.9 &amp; 10 Viet, c. 95,3o4o15 &amp; 16 Viet. c.54. s.14.19 &amp; 20 Viet. c,103, sees, SO &amp; 81.23 &amp; 29. Viet c.99, s.13.To deal with the matter more In detail j the salary of a County Court Judge In 1846, when the first County Court Act was passed, depended on fees with  1200 per annum as a maximum.     In 1852 the maximum was raised to  1500 with a minimum of  1200, In 1856 the salaries cf the County Court Judges were charged upon the Consolidated Fund and were fixed at  1200 a year with savings for certain named Judges who were already receiving salaries at the rate of either  1500 or  1550,      In 1865 certain additional fees were imposed upon suitors and the salaries fixed at the uniform rate of  1500, a rate which has continued ever since,The Court&quot;, established under the Act of 1346 had jurisdiet.ion to deal with common law actions where the debt or damage claimed did not exceed  20. except ejectment or actions where the title to any corporeal or incorporeal hereditament or any toll, fair, market or franchise came into question, or the validity of any devise, bequest, or limitation under a will or settlement, or .maiicious prosecution, libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction or breach of promise.      No penalty was imposed upon a plahtiff who chose to bring In a superior Court an action which he might have &apos;brought in the County
Court.     The Court baa a etriotly limited jurisdic-tion in partnership and as respects olaims for shares under an intestacy or legaoy under a will.      It had no Admiralty or equity jurisdiction.      The present bankruptcy system had not yet been invented, nor was there as yet any special legislation as regardB the olaims of workmen against their employers for personal injuries.Of these limitations and exceptions the action of ejectment has now in effect oome within the jurisdiction of the Court as have matters arising under wills or settlements:    the other limitations by referenoe to the olass of action remain, but the High Court may remit to the County Court for trial actions for malicious prosecution, libel, slander, seduotion, or breach of promise.    The pecuniary limits have been completely changed.      The Court may now try common lav; actions, whether of contract or of tort, up to a peouniary limit of  LOO, and by agreement of the parties above  100 without any pecuniary lirr.it. Furthermore,  a plaintiff who coomonoes in the iligh Court an action in which he recovers loss than  40 in contract or  10 in tort, recovers no costs, and if he reoovers less than .clCO in contract or  50 in tort, reoovors only County Court costs.    The enactments imposing these restrictions upon the recovery of costs (the last of whioh was passed in 1919) have transferred from the High Court to the County Court a vast mass of actions of a kind which 50 years ago formed the
staple work of the superior Courts at vifostminster. This conplotos the factory as regards the extension of the general oommon law Jurisdiction of the Courts.    But the accretions to that jiirisdiction due to special Aots of Parliament arc no less important, and it is perhaps most convenient to mention some of them in an order corresponding to tho relative amount of work which they havo imposed upon tho Courts.The Employers Liability act and the Workmen1sCompensation Acts taken together are the chiefof these onactments.      The series begins with the43 &amp; 44 Viot,    Employers Liability Act,  1660.      The present c.42.Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act extends practically toall classes of persons employed by way of manual labour, whose remuneration does no&quot;; exceed  350per annum, and the Judge of the County Court, who isthe sole Judge of fact, has power to award an amount15 &amp; 16 CJeo.Y   limited to  600 in the case of death or 30/- a week c.84.for life in the case of incapacity.     He has in addition the r:uty of seeing that an agreement entered into between the employer and workman for the settle-ment of a claim under the Aot provides adequate compensation for the workman,    It is hardly possible tc over-state the amount of worn which this legislation has Imposed uron the Court or the variety and difficulty of tho ones 11 one which arise under it. Scarcely less important iron, the point of view of
the County Court is the bankruptcy jurisdiction.32 &amp; 33 Viet,    In 1369 by the Bankruptcy Act of the.t year the c c 71 a t. !59 cCounty Court outside London became the Bankruptcy Court, and overy Judge of a local Court of Bankruptcy was given all the powers and jurisdiction of a Judge of the Court of Chsnoory without any limit, pecuniary or otherwise, as to the amount of jurisdiction.    The Act has frequently been amended but without affecting materially,  as far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, the position of the County Court. -The &quot;aent Restriction Acts have only very slightly extended the jurisdiction of the Court b-.it havo rendered the exercise of that jurisdiction, in oases of the recovery c:C tensaentis and of ejectment, exceedingly complicated, difficult, and exacting a    In deciding, as they of fc?.n havo to do, between two parties,  each suffering hardship, on which side the greater degree of hardship lies, the Judges have had to apply novel principles and by theii- administration have avoided some of the most dangerous consequences of the social unrest which proceeded necessarilj&apos; from the housing difficulty,.45 &amp; 47 &quot;Viet. By the Agiioultural Holdings Act, 1803, theco 61 s.23.County Court was constituted the court of appeal from the referee appointed under the Aos in any case where the sum claimed exceeded  7.00..     There was no upward limit and hit; decision was final except on a
point of law.     The Act has been frequently13 &amp; 14 Geo.V.     amended, and under the present law the arbitrator cn9, 8,15 and2nd Sched. may, and shall, If so directed by the Judge ofthe County Court,  submit a special case for the opinion of that Court on any question of law.More recently, new and important juris-dictions bsve been added under the Housing Act, 1925, the Legitimacy Act, 1926,  and the Adoption Act,  1920.Of less social importance arc the grant to the Courts in 1SS5 of an equity jurisdictionlimited, broadly speaking, by the value of theproperty brought into question, which was not to exceed  500:    and Admiralty jurisdiction conferred31 &amp; 32 Viet-      by Order in Council under an Act of 1368 up to c.71. secso2&amp; 3. a limit of  1000 in salvage for the property salved, 150 for towage, necessaries or wages, and  300 in damage to cargo or collison, but unlimited in amount with the parties&apos; consent,.There are in addition a number of lesser cases in which the jurisdiction has been increased, such as the Companies Act  (where the Court has jurisdiction in certain cases in respect of companies whose capital does not exceed  10,000), the Tithe Acts, the Rivers Pollution Act,  and the Highways Act,  1898.Finally, by the Landlord and Tenant Act
of last ss33ion the legislature has made the County Court the Ordinary tribunal to deal with claims under the Act-     It is at present impossible to foresee what amount of work may result in the Courts themselves from -chis provision, &quot;but it is bound to be considerable.In the result, the County Court, which was established in 184(3 os a Court for tho recovery, in a strictly limited class of action, of sums of money net exceeding  20, has become a Court with an origxnal jurisdiction iri almost every class of action up to  100, with an exclusive original jurisdiction in workmen1s compensation and (outside London) in bankruptcy;   a court entrusted with a peculiar jurisdiction of much social importance under tho Rent Acts,  and with a new and unlimited jurisdiction under the Landlord arid Tenant Act, besides considerable jurisdiction in admiralty and peculiar&quot; functions under other Acts.      For many years after the Court was established the main function of the Judge was to determine net the rights of the parties but the method whereby an admitted debt was to be discharged,     How his main function is to decide disputed questions of fact or- law up to a pecuniary limit and to deal with those which arise under the Woi-kmen/s Compensation Act and the Bankruptcy Act.It may be thought desirable in the course of consideration of the proposal to increase County Court
Judgan1 salaries tc boar in mind the general fiuanoilal position cf tho County Court a3 a whole.Until recent years tho convention was that the f.a-3z of the Cowrie Ghould &quot;be fixed at such a rate ao to produce a revenue equivalent to the expenditure upon tho Courts exclusive of salaries, pensions and travelling allowanoe of Judges and cost of housing the Court and its officials.     If that convention he adopted, the account for tho year ending March 31ot, 192G, shows a surplus of  93,COO, which, if tho factors conventionally excluded are brought into account, would become a deficit of  115.,000-In the year ending March 1927, the Court suffered a heavy loss in fees owing to the Strifce, and the surplus, excluding th* items mentioned above, fell to  37,000, while the deficit, if they are included, rose to  159,000.In the current year the amount already realised by way of incoiie id such as to on courage a confident hope that the laoome of the year will approach or exceed that f^r the year ended Harca Slat.  1980, and there are signs that la  ucoeotl&amp;rig years the business and therefore cho Income of the Court will revive still further,On the other hand,, it should be n*.*ted that
the Courts may have to face a hitherto unrealised liability in the shape of increments to the clerical staff and.an increasing pension burden. These enoviUts cannot be Quantified.Undor the convention already mentioned above, until tho V/ar the taxpayer bore the full burden of the salaries ox Judges and their pensions together with the coat of housing.      In addition in the year immediately proceuing the V/ar there was a deficit on tho running of the Courts, these items being excluded.     The taxpayer is, on the present arrangements, therefore-, bearing a srcaller actual burden in respect of tho County Court than he bore before the War.IsBut this/not the whole story.     Theresult of the series of enactments summarised abovehas been to devolve from the Supreme Court to theCounty Court tho work of trying a great number of substantial actions, which would otherwise have occupied the time of the Supreme Court and wouldhave necessitated sn addition to the numbors of the judges and officials greatly in excess of thatwhich Las in fact beon found necessary , while, owingto reasons which aro too technical hero to state,there 3^.s boon retained in the High Court the class offinanceaction most profitable from the point of view of tho /
of the Court, naiaely, those which never coae to trial but result merely in a use of the process of the Court for the collection of an admitted debt. In other words, as regards this class of action the more expensive and more difficult duties in connection with it are discharged by the County Court and the less difficult and more profitable by the High Court. The County Court may, therefore, fairly claim that the time has come when the two financial systems should be considered together and not separately.The convention with respect to High Court finance has been in the past similar to -chat already described with regard to the County Court, that is to say, the expenses of the salaries and pensions of the Judges have been borne by the taxpayer and an attempt has been made so as to adjust the fees that they produce anamount equal to the other expenditure of the Court, excluding the actual expenses of the Court of Criminal Appeal and of criminal justice on Circuit.      If this principle be applied, the Supreme Court in the year ended Liarch 1927 showed a Surplus fx^om fees somewhere about  200,000.    If for the purpose of the present calculation this convention is abandoned and an account is taken in which the civil litigant is charged with the whole cost of the administration of civil justice in the Supreme Court, and the fees are set against that cost, a surplus is still disclosed of  42,000.
In arriving at this conclusion, a deduction has been made from the salaries and other expenses ofthe Judges in respect of the amount of time occupiedby them in the discharge of criminal justice, andthe amount so set apart, namely,  75,000, left,as seems reasonable, for the taxpayer.    If, therefore,the two systems are considered together, a very substantial burden has sine 1913 been lifted fromthe shoulders of the taxpayer, and even if he beleft to bear the difference between the cost of civiljustice in the Supreme Court and County Court puttogether and the revenue from fees, he is payingvery much less than he did in 1913 and cannot reasonablycomplain if a part of the surplus produced is devotedto increasing the efficiency of the County Court*CoHouse of Lords,16th February, 1923.
