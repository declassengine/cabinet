Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1928.Copy No.    OUCONFIDENTIAL.CP. 60 (28;.MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Compensation of Civil Servants under Article 10 of Articles of Agreement with theIrish Free State.IN continuation of CP. 42 (28) and with reference to the Cabinet decisions of the 15th February (&quot;Cabinet 7 (28), Conclusion 6) and the 7th December (Cabinet 60 (27), Concl conclusion 4), I circulate an extract from the House of Commons Proceedings for the 23rd February containing my announcement of the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in the policy outlined by the Free State Government in their recent announcement in the Dail.It will be seen that in reply to the Supplementary Questions put to me by Sir W. Davidson, I based my answers on the clear intentions of those who framed the Article of Agreement. It is apparent, however, that it is not possible to answer adequately further questions on this subject unless the spokesman of the Government is in a position to answer how it is contemplated to give effect to this intention.The Irish Free State Government have already intimated their view (see despatch of the 9th February circulated in CP. 42 (28)) that a formal Agreement is necessary to be ratified by legislation.I assume, in view of the Cabinet decision of the loth February, that my colleagues are agreed in principle that the above course of action is necessary.It will not be possible to decide upon the details of the agreement, or of the United Kingdom legislation, until the draft of the Free State proposals is received; but I ask authority to make an announcement in the House of Commons, if and when the need arises, that both an agreement and legislation here are contemplated.I should, of course, agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the terms of any such announcement and also inform the Free State Government beforehand.Sir William Davison (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the announcement made in the Dail yesterday on the subject of the compensation to civil servants under Article 10 of the Irish Treaty of 1921, and whether His Majesty&apos;s Government have any statement to make ?Mr. Amery: His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain were informed in advance of the announcement which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish FreeL. S. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, February 27, 1928.APPENDIX.7mA Free State (Ex-British Civil Servants).February 23, 1928.[17275]
State proposed to make as to the policy to be adopted in the matter of the compensa-tion of civil servants under Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain indicated that they accepted the view that it would not be equitable that the transferred civil servants should receive more favourable treatment in the matters in question, which relate to the treatment of bonus, than if they had remained in the Civil Service of this country, and that they would be prepared, subject to agreement as to details of the legislation contemplated, to give their concurrence and co-operation in the proposed policy outlined by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State.
