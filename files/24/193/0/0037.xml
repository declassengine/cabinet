Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1928.1 t) confidential.- 30O.P. 88 (28).COMPENSATION OF CIVIL SERVANTS UNDER ARTICLE X OF THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN continuation of CP. 60 (28) and with reference to the Cabinet decision of the 7th March (Cabinet 13 (28), Conclusion 7). I circulate to my colleagues the subjoined report by the Law Officers, from which it will be seen that the Law Officers advise that legislation in this country is necessary in order to carry out the under-taking in paragraph 2 of the despatch to the Irish Free State of the 20th January (attached to my memorandum CP. 42 (2S)), and are of opinion that the best form of legislation would be by a statute declaratory of the meaning of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.I realise that our legislation will have to clear up the situation in Northern Ireland, but. so far as the situation in the Irish Free State is concerned, it seems to me that it would be setting a dangerous precedent to depart from the principle that the Treaty cannot he modified except by formal agreement between the two Governments followed by confirmatory legislation by the two Parliaments. This is the procedure which the Free State Government contemplate. They have definitely told us that they have been advised that an agreement between the two Governments is essential, and that it is proposed that the Free State Bill should contain provision for the ratification of such an agreement.We have asked the Free State Government to let us see their draft Bill as soon as they are able to do so; they have not yet sent over a copy, but it seems desirable that we should proceed at once to consult with them as to the details of legislation in both countries.Probably the most convenient plan would be to invite the Free State Government to send one of their legal officers to take counsel with our legal officers here.L. S. A.Dominions Office, March 19. 1928.APPENDIX.Law Officers to Colonial Office.Royal Courts of Justice, Sir, March 13, 192S.WE were honoured with your commands, signified to us in Sir II. F. Batterbee&apos;s letter of the 9th instant, requesting us to favour you with our opinion as to what action is necessary on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in order to carry out&quot; the undertaking in paragraph 2 of the despatch to the Irish Free State of the 20th January &quot; to give their concurrence and co-operation in the general policy&quot; outlined in the Irish Free State despatch of the 9th November, and, in particular, whether legislation in this country will be necessary as well as legislation in the Irish Free State, and, if so, what form such legislation should take.j 17407]
We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your commands, have the honour to Report That in our opinion legislation is certainly necessary. By the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922, Section 1 (I), the Imperial Parliament has enacted that the Articles of Agreement set forth in the Schedule shall have the force of law. The Irish Free State Parliament is now proposing to alter one of those Articles; and it seems to us that the Imperial Parliament, and not His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, are the only authority capable of assenting to an alteration in the Statute law.There is an additional argument in favour of this course arising from the fact that the Imperial Government has pledged itself to see that the Irish Civil Servants obtain the compensation stipulated by Article 10 of the Treaty; if. therefore, the Irish Free State refuses to pay this compensation there would seem to be no answer to the claim by the Irish Civil Servants against the Imperial Government to make up the difference.2. We think that the best form of legislation would be by a Statute declaratory of the meaning of the Act of 1920; this would have the advantage of involving no alteration in the Treaty with the Irish Free State, and of ensuring that the terms payable to Civil Servants in Northern Ireland will be the same as those payable in the Irish Free State; and it will effectually prevent the agitation which will otherwise undoubtedly commence for the payment to British Civil Servants of pensions on the terms decided by the Privy Council to be the right ones.We have &amp;cDOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG.T. W. H. INSKIP.The Rt. Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
