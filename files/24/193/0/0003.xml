Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1928.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    30CP. 53 (28).The Franco-American Draft Pact of Perpetual Friendship and the American Draft of an Arbitration Treaty to replace the Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty of 1908.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WITH reference to my memorandum of the 24th January last (CP. 22 (28)), I circulate to my colleagues the following extract from a despatch recently received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, reporting a conversation with the United States Secretary of State on the subject of the proposed Franco-American Pact of Perpetual Friendship.A. C.February 15. 1928.[A 903/1/45]Extract of Despatch from Sir E. Howard.In any event, I was glad to be able to give Mr. Kellogg a reply .... when he asked me to a dinner given by the Irish Free State Minister in honour of Mr. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, whether I had heard from you on the subject. I told him that all I knew so far was that the matter was, of course, receiving your close attention, but that even after proposals were officially submitted by the United States Government, it would take some time for His Majesty&apos;s Government to reply, as you would have to consult the Dominion Governments. The Secretary of State said he quite understood this, and added that he had not and would not speak to the Canadian and Irish Free State Ministers on the subject, as he quite realised that this was a matter of Imperial concern to be dealt with by the British Embassy. I thanked him, saying that this attitude was no doubt strictly in accord with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in different parts of the Empire.Mr. Kellogg then informed me that he had recently received a further note from M. Briand, which amounted to a refusal, couched in very polite language, to consider the Secretary of State&apos;s last suggestion for a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of all wars, on the grounds that this would not be compatible with the obligations of the French Government under the Covenant of the League of Nations. I asked him if he would, as before, let me have a copy of this French note, and this he said he would do if I came on his next reception day. I accordingly went to see him this morning and reminded him of his promise. He at once sent for copies of the note and then read it to me.   I enclose a copy herewith.Mr. Kellogg, in commenting on this, said that he could not understand why the arguments now used by M. Briand against a multilateral treaty of the kind proposed did not apply with equal force to a bilateral treaty. I said I presumed M. Briand considered that a bilateral treaty renouncing all wars as between the United States and France would not interfere with French previous treaty obliga-tions and alliances, because he no doubt thought there was no danger of a war of aggression on the part of the United States against any of the members of the League or of the nations specially bound to France by defensive alliance, such as Poland or Czechoslovakia. Mr. Kellogg replied that this might be so but that the principle remained the same, and to this argument I felt there was no reply.Mr. Kellogg went on to repeat with great vehemence that he would have none of a bilateral treaty which would be construed by other friendly Powers as in the nature of a defensive treaty with France, since it would leave it open to her to take 4314   [17227]
what action she liked in Europe and ensure the neutrality towards herself of the United States Government. If France rejected this proposal, he said, he thought he might submit it to the other European Great Powers. lie was convinced that if Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan agreed to it, the rest of Europe and of the vvorld would eventually come in. He again said that while, being without sanctions, the treaty could have nothing but moral force, he nevertheless believed that this moral force might be of the greatest value in educating public opinion in the direction of peace and it went as far as public opinion in the United States-would go at present. It had, at any rate, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate in its favour. He would never, he said, have made his proposal without previously consulting the Senate leaders, and one reason why his reply to M. Briand&apos;s first note of the 27th June had been so long delayed was because the President was by that time away in the west and the Senators were scattered all over the country, so that lie had to wait until the autumn to consult them.From being rather lukewarm over the matter it seems to me that the Secretary of State is now taking it very seriously, and is most anxious to get this treaty through by hook or crook.I could not but remark to him that it seemed to me that there was much to be said in support of M. Briand&apos;s objections, since it was impossible to avoid the con-clusion that a party to such a treaty might be called on some day to choose between its provisions and the commitments under the Covenant of the League and previous treaties, such as those of Locarno mentioned by M. Briand in his note.Mr. Kellogg said he was not going to hurry over his reply to M. Briand&apos;s last note and should not consider it until he returned from his visit to Ottawa after the first week in February.Translation of a Communication dated January 21, 1928. from the French Ambassador to the JJnited States Secretary of State.Mr. Secretary of State,Your Excellency was pleased to inform me, in your note of the 11th instant, of the consideration suggested to you by my letter of the 5th January in answer to your communication of the 28th December, 1927. My Government has asked me to express to you its satisfaction at the harmonizing, thanks to your Excellency, of the views of the two Governments concerning the best method of accomplishing a project upon the essential principles of which they apparently are in agreement.The original French proposal of June 1927, contemplating an act confined to France and the United States, appeared to the French Government to be both desirable and feasible by reason of the historical relations between the two republics.The American Government was only willing, however, to embodv the declaration-proposed by the French Government in the preamble of the Franco-American Arbitration Convention now in process of renewal, and considered, on the other hand, for reasons of its own which the French Government has not failed to take into account, that there it would be opportune to broaden this manifestation against war, and to make of it the subject of a separate act in which the other Powers would be invited to participate.The Government of the Republic was not opposed to this expansion of its original plan, but it would not but realise, and it felt bound to point out that the new negotiation as proposed would be more complex and likely to meet with various difficulties.The question as to whether there would be any advantage in having such an instrument, of a multipartite nature, signed, in the first place, by France and the United States, or else first elaborated by certain of the principal Powers of the world, and then presented to all for their signature, is essentially one of procedure.The Government of the Republic refrained from offering suggestions upon this point solely because of its desire more speedily and more surely to achieve the result which it seeks in common with the United States. This is tantamount to saying that it is ready to concur in any method which may appear to be the most practicable.There is, however, a situation of fact to which my Government has requested me to draw your particular attention.The American Government cannot be unaware of the fact that the great majority of the Powers of the world, and among them most of the principal Powers, are making the organisation and strengthening of peace the object of common efforts
carried on within the framework of the League of Nations. They are already bound to one another by a covenant placing them under reciprocal obligations, as well as by agreements such as those signed at Locarno in October .1925, or by international conventions relative to guarantees of neutrality, all of which engagements impose upon them duties which they cannot contravene.In particular, your Excellency knows that all States members of the League of Nations represented at Geneva in the month of September last, adopted, in a joint resolution tending to the condemnation of war. certain principles based on the respect for the reciprocal rights and duties of each. In that resolution the Powers were led to specify that the action to be condemned as an international crime is aggressive war. and that all peaceful means must be employed for the settlement of differences, of any nature whatsoever, which might arise between the several States.This is a condition of affairs which the United States, while a stranger thereto, cannot decline to take into consideration, just as must any other State called upon to take part in the negotiation.Furthermore, the United States would not in any way be bound thereby to the provisions of the covenant of the League of Nations. The French proposal of June last looking to the conclusion of a bi-lateral compact, had been drawn up in the light of the century-old relations between France and the United States; the French Government still stands ready to negotiate with the American Government on the same conditions and on the same basis. It has never altered its attitude in that respect. But when confronted by the initiative of the United States in proposing a multipartite covenant, it had to take into consideration the relations existing among the various Powers which would be called upon to participate therein. This it has clone, with the object of assuring the success of the treaty contemplated by the United States. Its suggestions of the 5th January as to the terms of the multipartite treaty are inspired by the formula which has already gained the unanimous adherence of all of the States members of the League of Nations, and which for that very reason might be accepted by them with regard to the United States, just as it has already been accepted among themselves.This is the explanation of our proposal of the 5th January.The Government of the Republic has always, under all circumstances, very clearly and without mental reservation declared its readiness to join in any declaration-tion tending to denounce war as a crime and to set up international sanctions susceptible of preventing or repressing it. There has been no change in its sentiments in that respect: its position remains the same. Your Excellency may, therefore, be assured of its sincere desire to respond to the idea of the American Government, and to second its efforts to the full extent compatible with the situation of fact created by its international obligations. It is this preoccupation which inspired the formula proposed on the 5th January, a formula which does, indeed, seem to be the most apt at this time to assure the accomplishment of the American project. The Govern-ment of the Republic accordingly cannot but hope that the American Government will share this view. Subject to these observations, the Government of the Republic would, moreover, very gladly welcome any suggestions offered by the American Government which would make it possible to reconcile an absolute condemnation of war with the engagements and obligations assumed by the several nations and the legitimate concern for their respective security.Pray accept. Mr. Secretary of State, the assurances. &amp;c.,PAUL CLAUDEL.
