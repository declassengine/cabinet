They state that (28).Imperial legislation for this purpose is &quot;certainly necessary&quot;.     They state further that the best form of legislation would be by a statute declaratory of the meaning of the Government of Ireland Act 1920.     This, they say, &quot;would have the advantage of involving no alteration in the Treaty with the Irish Free State and of ensuring that the terms payable to (transferred) Civil Servants in Northern Ireland will be the same as those payable in the Irish Free State, and it will effectually prevent the agitation which would otherwise undoubtedly commence for the payment to British Civil Servants of pensions on the terms decided by the Privy Council to be the right ones&quot;.A detailed statement of Lord Craigavon&apos;s views on the subject, so far as it relates to Northern Ireland, will be found in his letter of 13th March, 1928, of whioh a copy Is attached.     &quot;After the fullest consideration&quot; Lord Craigavon &quot;is strongly of opinion that Northern Ireland
&quot;should not be brought within the ambit of any legislation which the British Government s.;ay think It desirable to introduce&quot;.     He proposes that the Civil Service Committee established by the Act cf 1920 as the final authority for the assessment of the terms of compensation payable under Schedule VIII of the Act to Civil Servants transferred to the Northern Irish Government should make their awards on the basis of the Privy Council formula.The arguments in favour of this course advanced in Lord Craigavon!a letter are singularly unconvincing.     It is not the fact that Northern Irish Civil Servants for the work they do are morse paid than Civil Servants In this countryj   but even If it were the fact, the question of the adequacy or Inadequacy of Civil Service salaries in Northern Ireland has no bearing whatever on the question of the method of dealing with compensation payable under the Act of 1920 to transferred Civil Servants.     To suggest that the inclusion of Northern Ireland In the proposed legislation would involve increased salary scales for Northern Irish Civil Servants is merely absurd.     The further argument that Northern Ireland should be left outside the scope of the proposed legislation because, unlike the British Civil Service, the Civil Service In Northern Ireland has no tfhitley Council, is equally wide of the mark.     The proposed legislation has nothing whatever to do with the existence or non-existence of Whitlev Councils.&quot;    And Lord Craigavon&apos;s suggestion that he is in honour bound to resist the application to Northern Ireland of the proposed legislation because he guaranteed that Northern Irish Civil Servants should not suffer through having no Whitley Council is simply unintelligible.Two other arguments in Lord Craigavon&apos;s letter may be briefly&apos; referred to.
(a) The reference in paragraph 2 of the letter to the decision of the Civil Service Committee (which awards compensation and superannuation to Civil Servants transferred to the service of the Northern Irish Government) is somewhat misleading.Though the Committee did tell the Northern Irish Government in October that they had finally decided to follow the judgment as regards future awards of compensation, they have in fact only done so in five outstanding cases, and even in those cases they did not explain the basis of their award, which is probably not appreciated by the persons c once mod.In view of later events the Committee have reconsidered their attitude and have just informed the Northern Irish Government that their previous decision must be regarded a3 suspended.(b) Lord Craigavon argues that in the case of non-transferred Civil Servants - i.e. new entrants to the Northern Irish Service since the transfer - the Northern Iri3h Govern-ment will be bound to apply the judgment unless they legislate to the contrary.     They have, however,  (subjectto certain modifications which are not relevant to this question) taken over our Superannuation Acts with the substitution of the Ministry of Finance, Northern Ireland, for the Treasury as the filially deciding authority in superannuation cases.     In these circumstances they require no further legislative authority in order to continue thoir existing practice in these case3.The general inference to bo drawn from Lord Craigavon&apos;s letter is that the demand now made for the exclusion of Northern Ireland from the proposed legislation really arises from the fact that at a very early stage - certainly no later
9 9 9 /-(a) The reference in paragraph 2 of the letter to the decision of the Civil Service Corcmittoe (v;hich awards compensation and superannuation to Civil Servants transferred to the service of the Noi-thern Irish Government) is somewhat misleading.Though the Committee did tell the Northern Irish Government in October that they had finally decided to follow the judgment as regards future awards of compensation, they have in fact only done so in five outstanding cases, and even in those cases they did not explain the basis of their award, which is probably not appreciated by the persons concerned.In view of later events the Committee have reconsidered their attitude and have just informed the Northern Irish Government that their previous decision must be regarded as suspended.(b) Lord Craigavon argues that In the case of non-transferred Civil Servants - i.e. new entrants to the Northern Irish Service since the transfer - the Northern Irish Govern-ment will be bound to apply the judgment unless they legislate to the contrary.     They have, however,  (siibjectto certain modifications which are not relevant to this question) taken over our Superannuation Acts with the substitution of the Ministry of Finance, Northern Ireland, for the Treasury as the finally deciding authority in superannuation cases.     In these circumstances they require no further legislative authority in order to continue their existing practice in these cases.The general inference to bo drawn from Lord Craigavon&apos;s letter is that the demand now made for the exclusion of Northern Ireland from the proposed legislation really arises from the fact that at a very early stage - certainly no later
than the time when the Irish Free State revealed their disinclination to accept the judgment of the Privy Council -the Northern Irish Ciovernment formed the view (and possibly allowed it to become known) that they would be parties to no such wickedness, and would deem themselves in honour bound to implement the judgment in Northern Ireland, even though In terms the judgment relates only to the Irish Free Stat9.If, as the Law Officers propose, legislation is introduced declaratory of the meaning and intention of the Act of 1920, it must extend to Northern Ireland.-    Not only would it^ he utterly wrong a3 a matter of principle to lay down one&apos; law for the South and one for the North In this matter, but It mast also be remembered that if in Northern Ireland compensation were awarded on the basis of the Privy Council formula,  it ?;ould be the British taxpayer who would have in the long run to foot the bill.     On the assumption that the proposed legislation extends to Northern Ireland, the Civil Service Committee for Northern Ireland will be bound to assess compensation in Northern Irish cases in conformity with that legislation.     The Government of Northern Ireland will be able,  if they so desire, to say that the legislation, so far as it concerns Northern Ireland, runs counter to their expressed wishes.     And that, one hopes, might be the end of the matter.Treasury Chambers, 3.7.&apos;.l. March 20th, 1926.
!Stormont Cay tie, Strand town,Belfast,3RSONAL AND COSPIDT:i&amp; IAL. Ulster.15th March, 1928.My dear Churchill,I am no;? In a position to reply to your letter about the difficulty ?;hich has arisen in regard to Civil Servants&apos; Superannuation rights owing to the recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the &quot;Wigg and Cochrane case&quot;.After discussing the question very confidentially with my colleagues and with the Permanent Head of our Civil Service, I am of opinion that it would bo better not to include Northern Ireland in any change which you may find necessary to effect by legislation, but to allov; the decision of the Privy Council to continue to take effect as regards our Civil Service.I understand that the Civil Service Comr.ittee has already decided to rpply the v/igg Ccchrane decision in determining pension cases which havo come before them since the judgment of the Privy Council was given,  and some time ago we expressed our assent to their making this decision apply retrospectively. If we new ask them to reverse this decision or to make It inapplicable In the Future we shall undoubtedly arouse a lack of confidence among cur transferred officers which would not only be regrettable but which might seriously affect our whole Service since it : \    arjng the next few months that the trans-ferrod officers will have to determine whether to continue in cur service or to exercise their option to leave it under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act.
We have, as you are aware, set up a much lower scale of salaries for the higher positions in our Civil Service than obtains in yours, and we have also been able to effect great economies by not adopting the exact standard set by the Imperial Government in regard to allowances, and the grading of new entrants.     These substantial reductions were carried in face of considerable criticism that we were departing from the Imperial Govern-ment pra ct i ce .It is probably already known that this Government has accepted the Privy Council decision, and if we were now to agree to the introduction of legislation which would reverse this state of affairs in order to conform with the Imperial Government^ example I fear we should find it very difficult to uphold our already established reductions below the Imperial Government^ standard.     The increase in our expenditure which would be involved by an upgrading to your standards would be very marked and out of all proportion with the comparatively small amoxmts which are entailed on us by adopting the Wigg Cochrane formula.     The fact that you got agreement with your staff through your Whitley Council makes your position on this question different to ours, and this difference would cause other reactions in our Service upon which I need not enlarge.Moreover,  if I understand the position rightly, if you introduce legislation changing the wording of the Government of Ireland Act in respect to the rights of transferred officers, and if tho Civil Service Committee thereupon reverse their present practice it would not affect the method of calculating the pensions of non-transferred officers, and my Government might have to introduce legislation similar to your&quot;s in order to obviate the anomaly which would otherwise exist that later entrants into our
Service should receive higher gratuities than the transferred officers who had entered before then.Of course, it might be possible for us to help you by agreeing to legislation which would reverse the effect of the Wigg Cochrane decision and then give a special increment or other compensation to our Civil Servants to make good to them the loss, but this would not only be cumbrous In operation, but would I fear appear to be a direct reflection on your action.     Further I must explain that I am personally Involved inasmuch as when refusing to permit T^hitley Councils to be established within our Civil Service, I gave certain definite pledges to the effect that no one will suffer in consequence.     Whatever emerges therefore from the present difficulty i feel bound to honour these personal guarantees.After the fullest consideration, therefore, I am strongly of opinion that Northern Ireland should not be brought within the ambit of any legislation which you think it desirable to Introduce.     If you would be good enough to instruct your representative on the Civil Service Committee not to raise any question on the decision already given on this question, ??e would giv^ similar instructions to our representative and the matter would not then come before them, and the Committee would presumably continue to give gratuities based cn the Privy Council formula.Should there be any point in this letter In regard to the position of our Civil Service which is not quite clear,  i think it might bo found satisfactory If Colonel Spender crossed to London to explain them verbslly to you or to Sir Warren Fisher, whichever you prefer.hr o* irs s in cerely, (Sdc) CRAIGAVON.Right Hon. W.S,Churchill, K.P.., oncellor of the Exchequer, Treasury Chambers, Whitehall,S.W.1.
