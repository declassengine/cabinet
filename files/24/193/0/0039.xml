CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   30O.P. 90 (28).CABINET.THE TOT ALTS at or FROM ALL ANGLES.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I think my colleagues might be interested to read this extremely lucid analysis of the effects of the totalisator, which has been sent to me by a bookmaker.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, March 24. 1928.The Totalisator from all Angles.Now that the Jockey Club has definitely decided to recommend the adoption of the Pari-Mutuel, it will, perhaps, be interesting to study how it will affect the different interests concerned.   I take it they are: 1. The Government.2. The Public.3. The Professional Backers.4. The Racecourse Companies.5. The Owners.6. The Racecourse Bookmaker. 7. The Office Bookmaker. 8. The Thoroughbred. 9. The Jockey Club.I will endeavour to deal quite impartially with them in the above order, though it should be explained that this procedure has no relativity to the importance of each interest.     Incidentally, the ignorance of the [17432] bPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1928.
actual working of the totalisator is demonstrated by a sporting writer in a leading London evening paper.  He says : &quot;In calculating the place betting, the percentage is first deducted and the remainder divided between the three placed horses.&quot;This is totally wrong; the working is as follows: Presuming the receipts on a 10/- place pool were  2,000 and the placed horses arc A, B and C backed in the following proportions : the first deduction made is the 10 per cent, percentage, i.e.,  200, leaving a balance of  1,800. From this amount must be deducted the total stakes invested by A, B and C  485 leaving a balance of  1,315. The latter amount is then divided equally into three parts, approximately  43S to each placed horse. Thus, in addition to their stakes (already set aside) the 600 backers of A would divide  438, the 300 backers of B  438 and the 20 backers of C  438.The Chancellor has budgetted to derive a revenue of six millions under his Betting Tax scheme It seems highly improbable that he will obtain anything tike this amount, but if the Government sanctions the establish-ment of the Totalisator on the Uace-courses. it can only be presumed that it is calculating upon getting a large part of the estimated revenue from that source. It is my firm belief that, not only will he fail to get anything like six millions, but he will derive even less than is now being paid by bookmakers. In those countries where the Totalisator has been a large money-earner, racing is almost continually carried on in or near large cities, such as Paris. Berlin, Melbourne, Sydney, Johannesburg, Bombay. Buenos Ayres, Calcutta, &amp;c. Furthermore, racing usually takes place on Saturdays, Sundaj7s and public holidays.When a Race meeting is held in these places, everybody interested in racing personally attends the meeting, so that their betting is done on the spot and the revenue benefits accordingly. In this country, the geographical conditions are entirely different. Meetings are held all over the country and practically every dixy of the week. Only a small minority can attend; for instance, at a Newmarket meeting a few thousand people would be a good attendance, but there would &quot;probably be millions of backers making bets at home on the horses running at that meeting. What revenue, then, can the Chancellor expect to get from racecourse betting under such conditions? Very little. 1 fear. He will have to depend upon the office bookmaker for the bulk of his revenue. The present ad valorem tax of 3^ per cent, has admittedly been a failure. It is an impos-sible burden for a Bookmaker to bear, and up to now no method has beenA B CGOO Subscribers, 350 Subscribers, 20 Subscribers,The Government
evolved of passing it on to the hacker. Those who have tried to pass some of it on have found their businesses undermined by firms approaching their clients and&apos; -offering to bet with them tax free. There is no doubt evasion is carried on in a wholesale manner. tt is obvious, therefore, that the only manner in which a tax can be successfully imposed is by means of a graduated licence, or a considerably reduced ad valorem rate, and though neither of these methods will realise 6&apos; millions, either would realise a very substantial sum.The Public.The ordinary punter who is able to occasionally attend meetings held conveniently near, will take to the Totalisator like a duck to water. It holds out innumerable attractions for him. He is not concerned with &quot; beating the market.&apos;&quot; At present, he usually gets the leavings, and he will be tickled to death to know that on the Pari-Mutuel principle he is obtaining the same price about his fancy as the professional backer, the owner and the inspired people. Furthermore, he can bet for places only, and there is always the great fascination of very large odds being returned. 1 have known instances of backers being paid hundreds of pounds for a ten shilling investment. The possibility of being &quot;welshed is eliminated, also that of taking cramped odds. Whether the prices returned by the machine will in the long run compare favourably with bookmakers&quot; odds is problematical. Not only does the machine not gamble (but presuming it deducts 10 per cent.), immediately a pound goes on a horse, it is only worth 18/-. The bookmaker does gamble. If a first or second favourite wins, he invariably loses, and if through the success of unbacked horses he has a good day, he rolls up next day prepare &quot;ed to give his winnings a chance. Nowadays, the battle between backer and bookmaker is a very keen one. The money keeps passing to and fro between them, but it remains in the game. With the machine the reverse will be the case: 10 per cent, of the money which goes into it never comes back into the game, and with so much racing as there is in this country, I think betting will rapidly decrease simply through lack of funds.The Professional Backer.This is the man who will be seriously affected. The Totalisator holds no attractions for him. He is invariably inspired, and at present he turns his knowledge to good account by badly beating the market and incidentally the bookmaker. It is by beatiug the market that he is enabled to back two or three horses in a race, and inasmuch as he is invariably in a position to sift the wheat from the chaff, he makes his profession pay handsomely. He is, however, only enabled to do this when bookmakers are able to handle the[17432] * B 2
money of the ordinary public. It is a peculiar phenomenon that the races which are most attractive to the general public and on which they love to bet are open handicaps and that it is these particular races which the pro-fessional backer leaves severely alone. That this is the right theory is proved by the fact that winners of such races are not only hardest to find: but more outsiders win them than any other class of race. It is in these races that the bookmaker scoops the public money. The professional backer waits for weight-for-age races and two-year-old plates. Here he often finds a horse meeting the others at even weights which would, if handicapped, have to concede them many pounds and. in some cases, stones. Long training has taught him to be patient and to wait tor these races. Mis particular sources of information enable him to ascertain whether the particular horse is fit and fancied. If it is not, he may occasionally lay against it. If it is, he proceeds to pepper the bookmakers and to relieve them of the moneys lost to them by the genuine public. He may occasionally have to back a second or even a third horse to save himself: if he does, it is a very rare occurrence for them all to lose. Take away the public money referred to and you simply have the position of leaving the professional backer and the bookmaker to fight each other. Both have to make the game pay; they cannot live on each other, yet that is exactly what the situation would be if most of the public money was diverted to the Totalisator, as it presumably would be.The Racecourse Companies.A large number of people are under the impression that installing the Totalisator system on a racecourse is a very expensive undertaking. Pictures have been published in the daily Press of elaborate and costly machines. As a matter of fact, such machines are entirely unnecessary and may be termed a luxury. The Pari-Mutuel system is conducted with great efficiency on French and South African Racecourses without these machines. Blocks of inexpensive booths (usually about ten) are erected in convenient places, and I should say that such blocks would not, at the outside, cost more than  1.500 each to erect. The cost of running the Totalisator can be based on the fact that in South Africa that Department is carried out under contract by a private Syndicate at an inclusive cost (staff, printing, &amp;c.) of 1 per cent. Assuming that a percentage of 10 per cent, is deducted from the receipts and that the Chancellor required his 2 per cent., there would be a balance of 7 per cent. The Jockey Club has lately indicated that, in their opinion, betting should make some contribution to the general improve-ment of racing, increasing of stakes, a reduction of entrance fees to Owners and the prices of admission to the public. The 7 per cent, would handsomely cover all these requirements. In addition to these calculations, it must be remembered that in most races there are four dividends, i.e., the&apos;winner and the three placed horses.   These dividends are mostly made up to an even
amount, i.e., coppers are not taken into account, so that a further large revenue accrues to the Racecourse Company from such &quot; fractions.&quot;The Owner.Owners of horses come under two classifications. There is the wealthy owner who races for pure sport, often breeding his own horses, always anxious to see his colours first past the post, and, although perhaps lie occasionally indulges in a moderate wager, he pays little regard to that side of the game. To such an owner, the Pari-Mutuel will be a matter of indifference, though, no doubt, he will not be displeased at the prospect of larger stakes and reduced entrance fees. The other class of owner is a different proposition. He races purely from a commercial point of view. Horses are his machines and betting his means of exploiting them. To such owners, the Totalisator would be unwelcome, because the secret of his side /V getting the maximum of odds to the minimum stakes. Let us presume he lias a horse which he lays out to win a certain race on which he is going to invest  1,000, and that when his commission goes into the ring his horse&apos;s price is 8/1. He will probably obtain 8/1 about  250, 7/1 to  250 and 5/1 to the balance, in all, 6,250/1,000. By this time it is well known to professional backers that the horse is well expected and they proceed to follow the lead given. In all probability, the horse tightens up to about 3/1. The Owner may then, if he is of the careful kind, lay 1,750/500 against his own horse, a perfectly legitimate proceeding, leaving himself with a nice wager of 4,500/500, or he may even lay 3,500/1,000, leaving himself i&apos;,750 to nothing. It is by resorting to such methods as these that he is enabled to make the game pay, as even when he has backed one of his horses and it loses, his monetary loss is nothing serious.The Totalisator will not afford any of these facilities. He must accept the same price as the punter who invests his humble 10/-, and he cannot lice ut it. The only feature in his favour is the fact that in these countries where the Pari-Mutuel system is in vogue, selling races are few and far between. and inasmuch as that is the principal class of race selected by such owners to gamble on, they will be relieved from the necessity of providing for the contingency of &quot; buying in &apos;&quot; sometimes a most expensive item.To the small man. owning and training a few horses on his own account, the Tctalisator will be a boon. There will be increased stakes and reduced entrance fees two very important factors. This class of owner usually keeps his own council; his horses are not in the public eve, and his 1 letting is done in a very moderate scale. It is quite possible for the Totalisator to return such an Owner&apos;s horse at prices it would be i?npossible to obtain from bookmakers; moreover, if they run horses in races where they think they have no chance of winning, but are pretty confident of being placed, they can bet for places only and obtain substantial odds. I hare known horses to pay out as much as 200/ / for places.[17432] n 3
The Racecourse Bookmaker.The public in general are of the opinion that bookmaking is a &quot; money for nothing &quot; game. They picture the fraternity as a body of men living on the fat of the land, drinking nothing but vintage wines, smoking nothing but &quot; Corona Coronas,&quot; riding in luxurious cars, and covered with diamonds. Never was there a greater hallucination. The racecourse book-maker is a hardworking man and, if the real truth was known, there are not many of them who arc &quot;men of substance.&quot; It is owing to the prevailing impression that to be a racecourse bookmaker is &quot;Utopia,&quot; each year thousands of laymen start making a book on racecourses. They arc soon disillusioned. There is more money lost by these neophyte bookmakers each year than there is made by the successful men. They die out regularly like the &quot;snuff of a candle,&quot; but invariably the new season brings a fresh crop.How the Totalisator will affect them I hardly know. Earlier in this article I stated the inception of the machine would eliminate most of the public money and there would be a battle royal between the professional backers and the bookmaker. There is one redeeming feature on the side of the bookmaker. That is, the Totalisator only bets for ready money. I presume that at present three quarters of the betting taking place in Tattersalls King is done on credit. Whether these people who are now doing business with bookmakers in this manner would (so as to be able to bet on the machine) bring ready money with them I do not know. The Englishman is an easy-going individual. He does not like being put to a lot of trouble; besides, he may not like queuing up to draw his winnings, and it flatters him to know his icord is being taken. Then again, in betting with a bookmaker, the fact that he has a chance of getting better odds than those the machine will return will influence him. and he also has the advantage of knowing exactly what odds he is getting, which is not the case when he invests his money with the machine. These are psychological factors that time alone can decide. One thing, however, is certain. The bookmaker will continue to be the target of potential defaulters. The machine gives no credit. If I may venture an opinion as to the effect of the Totalisator on racecourse bookmakers. I would say that their business will be confined to laying well-backed horses and that they will be comnellad to offer lesser odds, but even such lesser odds will equal the &quot;tote&quot; returns for well-backed horses. Outsiders are only backed by the public and their money would go to the machines.The Office Bookmaker.What will he do? That is the question that interests the majority of backers.   If I were asked to estimate how the volume of betting was done. I would say Per cent.The street bookmaker The office bookmaker The racecourse bookmaker40 45 15
We are not concerned with the street bookmaker. He will, no doubt, find his own solution. Assuming that even if the Totalisator is introduced, nieecourse bookmakers will still carry oh their business, the oflice bookmaker will. I presume, conduct his business wholly according to the Totalisator returns, in which case he would require to protect himself by imposing limits, otherwise, he may find himself landed with large amounts for horses which may be returned at extraordinary prices both for win and places. The office bookmaker will be a special target for those Stables which make a practice of backing their horses away. Their horses would be neglected nn the course, thus ensuring a big return. Their usual method of working is to hand in large numbers of telegrams sufficiently late to prevent their being delivered until the race has been run. It will easily be seen that unless the bookmaker protects himself with limits, he will be in an extremely bad position. Competition will assure the backer that such limits will not be nil fail-.It is my firm opinion that if the Totalisator is installed on English-Racecourses and the office bookmakers decide to carry on their businesses in accordance with the prices returned by the machine, their business would lie equally as profitable as it is at present and they will not find any difficulty in paying a fair rate of taxation, say &quot;2 per cent, on turnover.The Thoroughbred.We may safely assume that the quality of our &apos;* thoroughbred *&apos; will not be affected by the inception of the &quot;tote.&apos;&quot;. Betting in France is conducted wholly through the machine, and many of their horses have been good enough to win our Classics, meeting our horses on even terms, and they have also succeeded in carrying oft a large number of our most important handicaps frequently under big weights.Buenos Ayres is another important racing centre, where betting is carried on without bookmakers, and it is acknowledged that their race horses are of &apos; very high class.&quot;In those countries where the bookmaker operates as well as the machine, the Racecourse Companies are able to offer large stakes with much smaller entry fees than those prevailing here. The Racing Calendar contained an announcement of the Johannesburg Christmas Handicap with  6,000 stakes, costing an owner  30 to win. The Stewards&apos; Handicap at Kempton Park this year was worth  1,000. and -it cost  15 to run. a very substantial difference. In Australia and India, betting is done by both bookmakers and the machine,, and the Racing is of a very high standard, and although, huge stakes are offered; the Racecourse Companies are invariably very prosperous. These large prizes create a demand for good class horses, and so long as this demand continues^&apos;high prices for British-bred Bloodstock is assured &quot;and the Breeding industry has nothing to fear. &apos; &apos;  1 &apos; &quot;
The Jockey Club.Lord Hamilton being the Chairman of the Jockey Club, it can, I presume, be safely assumed that the views on the Totalisator issued by him to the Press represent the view- of the Jockey Club, and are endorsed by them. According to those views, the three main benefits which are expected to be derived from the installation of the Totalisator on Race-courses are : (1.) A considerable reduction in prices at present paid for admission to the Racecourse by the public.(2.; A substantial increase in the stakes at present given by Race-course Executives.(3.) That the charge to Owners for entering their horses in different races will be much lower.Lord Hamiltoivs assumption that the Totalisator is going to confer all these benefits on the different parties interested can only be interpreted to mean that the present high rates of admission to the Racecourses, the small proportion of the stakes actually contributed by the Executives, and the exorbitant entrance fees paid by Owners, are all due to the fact that betting up to now has made no contribu-tion to these items, and that if the Totalisator is installed it will, through the percentage deducted, find sufficient money to bring about these Utopian conditions. Stripped of all camouflage, where does this percentage come from? Obviously from the -public&apos;s pocket. It is purely and simply a tax on winnings, because every penny deducted from the stakes invested on the machine means a shortening of the odds returned.The simplest demonstration of how the public will pay is in connection with the promise held out by Lord Hamilton that the installation of the Totalisator is going to substantially reduce the admission fees to Racecourses. Let us presume that instead of the present charge of  1 2.*. Gd. for the Grand Stand and Paddock, it is altered to 12/6,&quot; and that the person attending the meeting has a bet of  1 on each of 6 races. Immediately his  1 goes into the machine it automatically becomes 18/-, so that in addition to the 12/6 paid at the gate he is contributing 12/-through the medium of the machine, in all,  1 4s. Gd.Without disparaging the Totalisator in any way, it is hardly fair to state that all the disadvantages from which racing is at present suffering have in the past been due to the fact that racing has derived no revenue from betting. The real reason is well known to every racing man wyho has studied the question, and that is that there are far too many racing centres and too much racing. T submit there should never be more than one Race meeting a day, except on &quot;Rank Holidays. With regard to Racecourses, there are at present a very large number in existence: many of them are only used for the purpose of holding one or two meetings a year, and it is
out of those one or two meetings that they expect not only to pay a dividend to their shareholders and maintain their courses in good condition, but also to give suitable stakes for their races. To accomplish this successfully is unreasonable. Fancy a commercial man trying to make his business pay by opening his premises for two weeks in the year, and having to maintain his staff and keep his premises in order for the other fifty weeks. Something or somebody must suffer, and, in the case of a large number of Racecourses, they can only make both ends meet by charging exorbitant admission fees to the public, ridiculous entrance fees to Owners, and giving small stakes.Racing should be centralised at about nine centres, say, three in the South, and, of course, Newmarket, the other centres being one in Lancashire, one in Yorkshire, one in the Midlands, one in Scotland and one in Wales. If this were done, each course would every year be aide to hold 24 days&apos; racing under Jockey Club Rules and 10 days under National Hunt Rules. Their local taxation, maintenance and other overhead expenses would practically remain stationary, and, as they are forbidden by the Jockey Club to pay their shareholders more than 10* per cent dividend, the inevitable result would be larger stakes, lower entrance fees to Owners, and a considerable reduction in admission fees to the public, reforms which herd Hamilton oracularly maintains can only be arrived at by the installation of the Totalisator.
