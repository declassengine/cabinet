REVISED MILITARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN GREAT BRITAINAND IRAQ.(C.I.D. Paper No. 856-B.)(Previous Reference : OLD. Minutes of the 221st Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a letter from the Colonial Office covering a dra ft of the Revised Military Agreement (C.I.D. Paper No. 856-B), which had been prepared in accordance with the Conclusion to Item (1) at the 221st Meeting.Mr. AMERY said he understood that the Service Departments were satisfied with the Agreement. He had been carefully through it, and, in his opinion, it was a good Agreement from our point of view.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he thought the Agreement met the needs of our situation in Iraq admirably.SIR LAMING WORTHING TON-EVANS suggested that in line 3 of Article 2, the expression &quot; ground forces &quot; should read &quot; military forces.&quot; As this was the first Agreement of its kind, he thought it was as well to avoid using any expression to which exception might possibly be taken.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that &apos;&apos; ground forces &quot; had not been used in any disparaging sense, but was meant to indicate military units exclusive of air force. He did not particularly mind altering the expression, but it was just possible that the Iraquis, who were a very suspicious people, and had seen the present draft, might think that the alteration was more than a purely clerical one.SIR MAURICE HANKEY pointed out that in the discussions on reduction and limitation of armaments at Geneva, the term used was &apos;; land &quot; armaments.Mr. AMERY suggested that the Committee should agree to change the word &apos;: ground &quot; to &quot; military &quot; or &quot; land,&quot; provided that this would involve no difficulties with the Iraq Government.Conclusion.After a short further discussion, the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend (a.) That the expression &quot; ground forces &quot; in the third line of Article 2 should be amended to read land forces,&quot; provided this alteration would cause no difficulties with the Iraq Government.(b.) That the Revised Military Agreement should be approved subject to the above alteration.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, February 16, 1928.

Paper, A&apos;o. 778-B.)Revised Military Agreement between Great Britain and Iraq. Letter from the Colonial Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence. (No. 58108/1928.)Sir.      ^ Downing Street, February 2, 1928.WITH reference to Conclusion (c) recorded in minute 1 of the 221st meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 25th February, 1927, which was approved by the Cabinet at its meeting held on the 3rd March, 1927, I am directed to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Committee, the draft of the revised Military Agreement between Great Britain and Iraq which, subject to any observations that the Committee may have to make, the Secretary of State proposes to authorise the High Commissioner for Iraq to negotiate with the Iraq Government.2. Although the Cabinet decision referred to above was reached at a time when it was not anticipated that a new Treaty between Great Britain and Iraq would be concluded at such an early date, the Treaty which was signed in London on the 14th December last contains provision, in Articles 12 and 13, for the conclusion of revised Financial and Military Agreements, and the Secretary of State has accordingly directed me to submit the enclosed draft of the revised Military Agreement to the Committee for their consideration.3. Articles 1, 4 and 9 of the draft formed the subject of discussion with King Feisal during the course of the negotiations that preceded the signature of the new Treaty, and received his concurrence in the form in which they appear in the draft. The three Articles must be regarded as in the nature of agreed documents, any modification of which could be contemplated only on the most compelling-grounds. The complete draft of the Agreement has been discussed with, and has received the concurrence of, the other interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Secretary of State would be glad to be advised whether the Committee also concur in the terms of the draft.4. I am to add that, as it is desired that instructions on the subject should be forwarded to the High Commissioner for Iraq at as early a date as possible, the Secretary of State would be much obliged if the matter could receive the early consideration of the Committee.5. Copies of this letter, and of the draft enclosed herein, are being forwarded to the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Treasury and the Dominions Office.I am, &amp;c.J. E.

Enclosure. Draft of Revised Military A greement.Whereas a Treaty of Alliance and Amity between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq was signed in London on the 14th day of December, 1927, corresponding with the 18th day of Juraada-al-than  , 1346, Hiirah; andWhereas by Article XIII of the said Treaty it is provided that a separate &apos; agreement shall regulate the military relations between the High Contracting Parties.Now, therefore, it is agreed between His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and the Government of Iraq as follows : Article I.The two Governments hereby recognise the principle that the Government of Iraq shall at the earliest possible date accept full responsibility, both for the maintenance of internal order and for the defence of Iraq from external aggression. They also recognise, however, that the resources of Iraq are at present insufficient for this purpose, and therefore His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain will afford such support and assistance as they may consider necessary and decide upon, from time to time.   -Article II.The support and assistance to be provided by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain shall take the form of the presence in Iraq of a British Air Force, together with such ground forces as may from time to time be considered necessary. These forces shall normally be available to assist the Iraq Government in the maintenance of internal order and in the defence of Iraq against external aggression, but His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain reserve to themselves the right, if and when need arises, to employ these forces elsewhere. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain will, however, give as much notice as the case permits of any decision to employ these forces outside Iraq. The two Governments recognise the principle that the excess of the cost of any British forces stationed in Iraq over the cost of such forces if stationed in Great Britain (or in India, in the case of units of the Indian Army) shall be borne by the Iraq Govern-ment to the extent that the financial resources of that Government permit; and that if such excess cost cannot now be borne by the Iraq Government the proportion of such excess cost falling on the funds of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain shall be progressively reduced with all possible expedition.Article III.Subject to the proviso in Article IX of this Agreement, it is further agreed that His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain will undertake the responsi-bility of the naval defence of Iraq against aggression from the sea.Article IV.His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain agree to grant facilities in the following matters, the cost of which will be met by the Iraq Government: 1. Military and aeronautical instruction of Iraq officers in Great Britain so far as this may be possible;2. The provision in sufficient quantities of arms, ammunition, equipment and aeroplanes of the latest available pattern for the Iraq Army;3. The provision of British officers (in such numbers as may be mutually agreed upon between the two Governments) for the purpose of ensuring efficient co-operation between the British Forces in Iraq and the Iraq Army. Such officers shall be employed upon terms of service identical with those upon which British Military Officers are at present serving.Article V.So long as support and assistance is rendered to the Iraq Government by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in accordance with the provisions
of Article II of this Agreement, the following provisions shall regulate the military-relations to be maintained in Iraq between the two Governments.&quot;Article VI.The Iraq Government undertake, in so far as their financial capacity permits, to maintain the various arms of their military forces at such strength as may be agreed on from time to time between the two Governments. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain shall equip the units of these forces, as and when they are-completed, in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of this Agreement.Article VII.The Iraq Army, shall, subject to the provisions of the Iraq Constitutional Law, be commanded by His Majesty the King of Iraq.

His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.Article X.In the event of operations being undertaken in which forces maintained or controlled in Iraq by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain are to take part, the command of the combined forces shall, subject to any special arrange-ment which may be accepted by both parties, be vested in a British commander selected for the purpose.Article XI.The Iraq Government undertake to recognise and, if necessary, to secure by legislation or otherwise, the following powers and immunities for any armed forces maintained or controlled in Iraq by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, such armed forces to be regarded as including civilian officials and Indian public followers attached to and inhabitants of Iraq serving with the Air and Military Forces : (a.)
