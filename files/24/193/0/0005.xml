Gifts to Afghanistan from Russia of Cash and Munitions.The Russo-Afghau Treaty of 28th February 1921, as officially communicated by M. Krassin, contained : Article X. &quot;In order to strengthen friendly relations between the High Contracting Parties, the Government of the R.S.F.S.R. agrees to give to Afghanistan financial and other assistance &apos;&quot;; andA supplementary article, &quot; In amplification of Clause X of the present Treaty, the Government of the R.S.F.S.R. gives the following assistance to the sovereign state of Afghanistan :  (1) A yearly free subsidy to the extent of 1,000,000 gold or silver roubles in coin or bullion.(2) Construction of the Kushk-IIerat-Kandahar-Kabul telegraph line.(3) In addition to this the Government of the R.S.F.S.R. expresses its readiness to place at the disposal of the Afghan Government technical and other specialists.The Government of the R.S.F.S.R. shall afford this assistance to the Govern-ment of the sovereign state of Afghanistan within two months after the coming into force of the present Treaty. The present -supplementary clause shall have the same legal validity as the other clauses of the present Treaty.&quot;This treaty was ratified by the Soviet Government on 20th May 1921 and by the Amir on 4th August 1921.It had been suspected that there were secret clauses attached to the Treaty, and Sir II. Dobbs was instructed to press for the communication of them by the Afghan Government as a condition precedent to a Treaty of Friendship with I lis .Majesty&apos;s Government. Though this request was not officially complied with. Sir II. Dobbs was able to report on 13th September 1921 that he held a written but unsigned and undated memorandum in the handwriting of the Mustashir of the Afghan Foreign Office which had been delivered to him on 3rd June, and stated that Russia promised (a) A subsidy of 1,000,000 gold roubles per annum.(b) 7,500 magazine (5-shot) rifles with 2,000 rounds per rifle.(c) 12 field guns and eight anti-aircraft guns with ammunition and equipment.(d) 12 aeroplanes with accessories and personnel.(e) Complete factory plant for the manufacture of smokeless powder. (/) Telegraph material for a line Herat-Kandahar-Kabul.(It will be noticed that items (a) and (/) appear also in the non-secret supplementary article of the treaty.)As regards the fulfilment of the Russian undertakings, our information is briefly as follows: (a) Payment of outstanding arrears of the first year&apos;s instalment of the cash subsidy appears to have been completed about the middle of 1923. We have no definite information that any further instalment has been paid, and there are grounds, which will appear later in this note, for believing that payment of later instalments is in arrears(6) In June 1924 it was believed that 7,500 magazine rifles and 12,000,000 roundsof ammtmition had already been delivered to the Afghans. 2614      75   2.28rwiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiHii...........i iHMiiiiiiiiiiiinimiii......lyniimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii inn iminnniniTinTiTnnmiiiniiiiinniniiiiiiM iiiinniHiBiaiiiiiiiTmi^fiTrMiVfiinffirTr^hiHWii^w^ywiAiiiWMiPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1928.SECRET.CP. 55 (28).I circulate for information, in connection with other papers regarding the impending negotiations with Afghanistan, a note prepared in my Department summarising the available information derived from various sources as to the gifts made to Afghanistan by Russia since 1921.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.20th February 1928.
(c) Twelve field guns were in 1921 believed to have been handed over, and twoanti-aircraft gnus. It has recently come to our knowledge that Moscow proposes to supply two anti-aircraft guns in completion of their undertakings in 1921, from which it is to be inferred that six anti-aircraft guns have already been supplied.(d) Setting aside five aeroplanes purchased in 1921 by the Afghans, there arestill apparently four outstanding of the 12 to be supplied gratis under the treaty, and Moscow is understood to have proposed to supply them at an early date.(e) It is understood that the powder factory plant has not yet been supplied bythe Russians and that, the Afghans contemplate meeting their requirements themselves with technical assistance from Germany. (/) In answer to a question in the House of Commons by Sir Alfred Knox on 10th November last, it was stated that a telegraph line from Kandahar to Kabul, constructed with Russian assistance, had been opened, and another from Kushk to Kandahar was in course of construction and understood to have reached Farah. A request has been received from Afghanistan for the supply from India of telegnmh wire for the uncompleted portion of the line between Farah and Kandahar, and it has recently come to our knowledge that an agreement has been reached with the Afghans whereby Russia will supply technical and material assistance for completion of this portion under Afghan supervision at an early date.In addition to their undertakings under the treaty, the Russians have offered to construct a telegraph line from Mazar-i-Sharif via the Zemistau pass to Kabul. We have recently learnt of an agreement at Kabul that this shall be carried out by lst July 1928. In furtherance of their undertakings to supply technical assistance the Russians have also furnished (it is understood on payment; road and other engineers for employment under Afghan control.In May 1920 Sir F. Ilumphrys reported that, a party of Afghan officers was shortly proceeding to Russia to select artillery which Moscow offered to supply to the Afghan Government. (Sir F. Huniphrys believed that this would include the 12 field guns promised, though, as stated above, it had been reported from other sources that these had been supplied.) We have heard at intervals of negotiations proceeding at Moscow regarding the supply of these munitions. A report has recently been received to the effect that an agreement was signed at Moscow on 24th December for the supply to Afghanistan in instalments during the present year of munitions apparently to the value of about 4,000,000 roubles, half of which sum is to be paid in five annual instalments by the Afghans and half to be set against the Russian subsidy (from which it would appear that at least 2,000,000 roubles is considered to be available from the subsidy, though this need not all represent arrears).   The. arms which are now to be supplied appear to include  (a) 10 field guns and spare parts (possibly the balance of the 12 field guns promised under the treaty).(b) 10 small howitzers and 7 trench mortars (with 500 rounds for each piece).(c) 24 mountain guns.(d) 3 flights of aeroplanes (8 light bombing planes, 8 reconnaissauce planes, andS fighting planes.(e) Stores for an aeroplane repair shop.The cost of transport of the artillery and stores is to be paid for by Afghanistan, aud the aeroplanes are to be delivered by Russia at Tashkent. It is not clear which of these munitions are to be regarded as gifts from Russia and which as purchases by Afghanistan, but. it appears that the Afghans attach chief importance to delivery of the artillery, in particular the 24 mountain guns, and desire the aeroplanes to be treated as purchases rather than gifts. It seems possible that the agreement, which provides for commencement of delivery four months after its entry into force, may be ratified at an early date.From the above it will be seen that, apart from the subsidy, the Russians have now to a large extent carried out their undertakings under the treaty. As regards the subsidy, our information is insufficient to say what amount remains io be paid, but the King has been reported by Sir F. Ilumphrys to have complained on various occasions that the Russians do not keep their promises, and it is to be inferred that in this respect they are considerably in arrears of their undertakings, unless, as is possible, they have charged against the subsidy the pay of the Russians employed in the Afghan Air Force and the cost of training Afghan airmen in Russia.
