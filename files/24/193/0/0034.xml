This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1928.SECRET. Copy No.     30CP. 85 (28).CABINET.PROPOSED ZIONIST LOAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE a statement submitted to me by the Zionist Organisation in London regarding the project for securing a loan under the auspices of the League of Nations to promote Jewish settlement in Palestine.I have had the opportunity of discussing this matter personally with the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.A memorandum by the Lord President on the subject was recently circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 71).I am in general accord with Lord Balfour&apos;s view that the financial relations between Great Britain and Palestine have not been so one-sided as is often represented. The case is, perhaps, not quite so strong as Lord Balfour puts it in his memorandum. It is true that Palestine has been required to bear a portion of the Ottoman debt, but so have all the other areas which were detached from Turkey as a result of the war. Palestine stands alone in having made two contributions towards her share of the service of the debt; but these contributions will be set to her credit if and when a final settlement is made. Similarly, the comparison of Palestine and Iraq as regards relief from war debt needs some qualification. There were two military administrations in Palestine. One of them left a surplus, the other a deficit. Palestine was allowed to retain the surplus, which was the larger figure of the two. so that the demand that she should repay the deficit is not unreasonable.Nevertheless, I do feel that the time has come when the Mandatory Power might well make some more positive contribution towards the development of Palestine, and that such contribution might appropriately take the form of furthering a scheme for the promotion of Jewish settlement on well thought-out lines. My colleagues are probably aware that we are passing through a period of economic depression in Palestine, and that the Zionist Organisation itself is finding great difficulty in meeting its obligations. This in itself might conceivably be regarded as a reason for asking the British Treasury for some special assistance. But I do not take that ground. .1 do not ask for help in meeting an immediate emergency or tiding over temporary difficulties. I should be unwilling to approach the Cabinet unless I could put before them proposals of a. definitely constructive character. I believe that the proposals submitted by the Zionist Organisation fully merit such a description.Turning to the proposals themselves, I should like to make it clear in the first place that the contemplated loan would be to the Zionist Organisation. The money would be raised by the Organisation under the guarantee of the League of Nations. That must mean in practice a guarantee up to a fixed amount by individual members of the League. It will be agreed that, in the present case, the major portion of the guarantee must fall upon the British Government. Any other arrangement would reflect unfavourably upon our position as mandatory for Palestine. The figure suggested by the Zionist Organisation for the total loan is  2,000,000. If that figure is accepted &quot;the British share should not, in my opinion, be less than, say,  750,000 or  1,000,000. For the rest we should have to look elsewhere. France, Italy, Germany and perhaps some of the smaller States might all be willing to bear their[17387]
share. I understand that Dr. Weizmann, the President of the Zionist Organisation, has been in informal communication with some of the French Ministers and believes that they would be prepared to follow a British lead. I realise that, whatever might be the amount of the British share, no guarantee could be given without definite Parliamentary authority; but I am disposed to think (and 1 believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shares my view) that such authority could be obtained without insuperable difficulty, provided the project comes before Parliament as one bearing the imprimatur of the League of Nations and carrying its strong approval and support.I suggest that, if my colleagues concur generally in my view, the first step should be to ascertain, througli the Foreign Office, whether the French, Italian and other Governments would be prepared to participate and to support us in raising the question at Geneva.L. S. A.Colonial Offi.ce, Downing Street, March 15, 1928.&apos;Statement submitted by the Zionist Organisation for the consideration ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.1. THE Mandate for Palestine not only provides that the Mandatory Power shall be responsible (inter alia) for placing the country under such conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home, but particularly enjoins the Administration of Palestine to co-operate with the Jewish Agency in encouraging close settlement by Jews on the land. Thus the establishment of the Jewish national home is recognised as a matter of international concern, and among the means of achieving that object, the settlement of Jews on the land is singled out as deserving the special attention both of the Zionist Organisation and of the Mandatory Power.2. The Zionist Organisation has promoted the settlement of Jews on the land to the furthest limits of its resources. These resources are derived from voluntary contributions. It could not, in the nature of things, be otherwise. The Jewish national home must of necessity be built upon the free-will offerings of the Jewish people. But this, while an unalterable feature of the conditions under which the Zionist Organisation is required to carry out its constructive work in Palestine, places it, as a colonising agency, in a position o&quot;f peculiar and, indeed, unparalleled difficulty. A Government engaged in colonisation commands ample capital. The same is true of such a body as the Greek Refugees Settlement Commission. The Zionist Organisation does not enjoy this advantage. Its annual income during the past five years has averaged about  700,000. There is no reason to suppose that this income will diminish; there are good reasons for expecting it to increase. But a substantial and growing income is in itself no substitute for the capital without which the orderly execution of an extensive scale of a systematic plan of colonisation presents serious difficulties. The Zionist Organisation has boldly faced these difficulties. It has met with a considerable measure of success; but its task would be immeasurably simplified if it could be enabled, under suitable conditions, to anticipate a part of its revenue by means of a loan to be raised for the sole purpose of promoting and expediting close settlement by Jews on the land, as contemplated by the Mandate.3. It is hardly necessary to point out that a well-considered scheme of agricultural colonisation would be the most effective means of facilitating the absorption of the unemployed into permanent and productive employment. The Zionist Organisation is satisfied, as a result of careful enquiries, that, given the necessary initial credits, a considerable number of Jewish workers could be settled as allotment-holders in or around the existing agricultural colonies, with every prospect of becoming self-supporting at an early date. It is not suggested that the whole of the Jewish unemployed could thus be provided for, but there is good reason to believe that labour could be drained from the towns on to the land on such a scale as would at once reduce the problem of unemployment to manageable proportions. The employment thus provided would in turn react favourably on the labour market, by creating an effective demand for a variety of goods and services, and would gradually liberate for constructive purposes the Zionist resources now diverted to relief.   The Zionist Organisation is convinced that it is in this direction
681,991The loan would be further secured upon the assets to be created from the proceeds of the loan in the execution of the colonisation schemes referred to below, and upon the payments to be made by settlers in reimbursement of advances.(d.) The loan would be raised solely for the purpose of facilitating the settle-ment of Jews on the land. The proceeds would be used in accordance with detailed plans to be submitted in due course (i) For the consolidation of the existing agricultural settle-ments by completing their equipment and carrying out such amelioration works as may still be required with a view to their being placed, as soon as possible, on a self-supporting basis.(ii) For the execution of a further programme of agricultural colonisation, including in particular the settlement of groups of Jewish workers as allotment-holders in or in the neighbourhood of existing colonies, and more especially the plantation colonies. There is reason to believe that employment could be found for a considerable number of workers in these colonies, provided that they were enabled to supplement their earnings during the off-season by working on their own allotments.(iii.) A portion of the proceeds of the loan might also be used for making advances, under suitable conditions, to persons possessing some capital of their own who are desirous of settling on the land a class for whom only very limited credit facilities are at present available.(e) It goes without saying that the Zionist Organisation would be ready to co-operate in giving effect to any appropriate arrangements which may be regarded as necessary or desirable for the purpose of assuring the service of the loan, and the application of the proceeds of the loan to the purpose for which it is raised.5. In submitting these proposals to His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Zionist Organisation earnestly trusts that they may receive serious and sympathetic consideration. It is convinced that it is by these means that the Mandatory Power can most effectively demonstrate its practical interest in the successful settlement of Jews in Palestine, and in the establishment of the Jewish national home.(Signed) Ch. WEIZMANN.77, Great Rvssell Street, London, W.C. 1,January 31,1928.that a permanent solution of the problem of unemployment can most hopefully be sought.4. The proposal which the Zionist Organisation has the honour to submit for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government is, in outline, as follows : (a.) Great Britain should join with such other Powers as are willing to co-operate in guaranteeing a loan of the order of magnitude of  2,000,000, repayable in about forty years, to be raised under the auspices of the League of Nations. There is reason to believe that the co-operation of other Powers would be obtainable.(b.) The loan should be raised either by the Zionist Organisation, as the body recognised by the Mandate as the Jewish Agency for Palestine, or, if thought desirable, by some other suitable body to be selected or constituted for the purpose by agreement between the guarantors and the Zionist Organisation.(c.) The loan would be secured upon the income of the Zionist Organisation, consisting in the main of the receipts of the Palestine Foundation Fund and the Jewish National Fund. The average income of these two funds during the past five years has been as follows :  .Palestine Foundation Fund     ... ... 497,264Jewish National Fund ... ... 184,727
