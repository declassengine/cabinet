Briand^(Circulated in accordance v/ith Cabinet 14 (28),  Concluaion 5 (b)).In the course of Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;a general discussion with Monsieur ^riarid on disarmament recorded irculated     in a separate memorandum? Sir Austen Chamberlain raised I (28). also tiie question of Air forces.    He said that his majesty&apos;s Government did not seriously consider the eventuality of an air warfare between France and Great Britain;  there was, however, a degree of disparity between the Air forces of the two countries which, If reached, must disturb public opinion.    Ho was,  therefore, troubled by information that the French Chamber had recently voted something like a minimum of 15C Air squadrons, with the possibility of an unlimited increase.    He believed that our squadrons were at most one-third of this number.Sir Austen Chamberlain reminded Monsieur Briand that he had recently raised this question with Monsieur de Fleuriau and had suggested a parity agreement as between Great liritalvi, Srance and Italy; he now wished to make clear - what he &quot;Mad not at the time explained to tho Ambassador - that tho parity contemplated by His
ilajouty&apos;3 Government referred to metropolitan force only, i.o. forcou capable of bo lug uood immediately for homo defence.    In addition to theso and outuide the proposed arrangement would bo tho squadrons on which Great Britain rolled (in some cases almost oxoluoively) for the defence of territory in the East.Monsieur do Fleuriau had replied to his original proposal that the fact that France had no separate Air force would make any pai&apos;ity arrangement impossible on administrative grounds alone;    :Jir Austen Chamberlain could not really accept this   aa a sufficient obstacle, seeing that, however, organised, French and British Air forces Would, in fact, bo uuod for approximately the same purposes and duties.Foreign 10 thOffice, j&amp;arch,  If.) 23.
