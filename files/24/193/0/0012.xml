I C R B T. COPY NO;10K 62 (23).CABINET.FILM   CENSORS::!?.jfernorandtup. by the Home So oretarycThe controversy which has arisen ever the film &quot;liawn&quot; which deals with the execution of Nurse Cavell will probably lead to a demand f&quot;om sane quarters for the setting up of an official censorship of films.     Notice has been given of tJrree Questions addressed to me for Thursday asking in effect whether it is tne intention of the Govenunent to take over the responsibility for the censorship of films. In these circumstanccs I think it desirable that my colleagues should fciow what the present position is and should consider &quot;hether any change of policy is required^In this country the responsibility for controlling the character of films for public exhibition rests with the local licensing authorities who, in pursuance of the Cinematograph Act., 1909, license the premises where films are exhibited,     Vhen this Act was framed censorship was not contemplated, but soon after the passing of the Act local authorities began to Impose conditions in their licences as to the character of the films to be shown to the public, andtheir action was supported by a series of decisions in the HighthatCourt with the result/it is now recognised that the function of censorship is an Important part of the duties of the licensing authoritiesIn the early years many complaints were received as to the undesirable character of the films exhibited, and realising the need for protecting their own interests the trade decided in 1912 to set up a censorship of theirJIS&quot;D0CU!4tfBT IS TIES PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC r AJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).
own. The late Mr. Redford was appointed film censor and was assisted by four examiners appointed by him. There was at that time little or no co-operation between the film censors and the local authorities. In 1916 the then Secretary of State, Mr. Samuel, considered the substitution of an official Board of Censors and he consulted the local authorities and the representatives of the trade. After protracted negotiations the former agreed to fall in with the scheme but the trade finally disagreed. Instead they remodelled their own Board of Censors and appointed Mr. T.P. O&apos;Connor in place of Mr. Redford whose health had given way.

Mr. T.P. O&apos;Connor was given a free hand and it was left to him to select the assistant censors. His assistants actually undertake the work of examination subject to his personal decision in difficult cases. There are four such assistants - three men and one woman - who are all persons of education and experience and well suited for the work. The Secretary of the Board has a wide knowledge of the trade and has considerable influence with its members. The trade does not attempt to interfere in any way with the actual work of censorship and the present personnel of the Board would certainly decline to be influenced by trade considerations.

The local licensing authorities exercise their control by imposing a condition in the licences granted by them that no film which has not been certified for exhibition by the Board of Film Censors shall be shown without the express sanction of the licensing authority. This condition was recommended by the Home Office for adoption and is now in general use with the result that the decisions of the Board are now enforced - in all but exceptional cases - by the licensing bodies and thereby acquire a measure of official authority.
It Is of course open to the local authority to allow the exhibition of a fila which has &quot;boon refused a ccrtificato by the Board, ani there arc cases involving wide issues such as the film &quot;Dawr.&quot; rhero the Board of Film Censors are justified in refusing- a certificate in ordor that tho decision nay be made by the responsible local authorities.It will be seen that the present system of censor-ship is really a dual one, nanely,a central examination by the Borird of Film Censors and a local examination when necessary by the licensing authority.The present system has certain great advantages -(l) It places the ultimate responsibility on the local authority and consequently aoets the difficulty arising from varying standards.    In soae provincial to-&apos;ns public opinion is notoriously aore sensitive than In London, and they objact to films which are considered unobjectionable by the London County CouncilIf the central examination were In the hands of an ofiioic.1 body, either this variation of standard would have to be left out of consideration altogether or, if the licensing authorities were allowed to object to the decisions of the official censors, there would be greater risk of fraction.(B) It relieves the Government of a difficult responsibility.     Sane Uinistor - presumably the Hone Secretary - would have to answer in the House of Commons for the decisions of the offic 1:0. body of censors, and he would be liable to meet constant criticism either as to undue leniency or as to excessive interference with freedom of expression.
a r.-In natters of taste and morality the experience of the Lord Chamberlain in connection with play3 shows how thankless such a duty would be, and in the industrial political or international sphere the duty might be even more difficult.    The Secretary of State is of course able to prevent the exhibition of subversive films, but if every film of every kind had to be submitted to official oonsorship, the position of the Government of tlie day would be embarrassing.   A good example is the film &quot;King of Kings&quot; which was refused a certificate by the British Board of ^lord Censors but on a subsequent appeal to the London County Council and the Middlesex County Couiici was allowed to be exhibited.(S) The rejection or substantial alteration of a film often involves a serious financial loss and it is open to doubt whether the trade would accept the decisions of an official body as readily as they accept the decisions of the Board of Film Censors as at present constituted.It is true that the present position appears anomalous and would be opon to damaging attack if the trade were to appoint unsatisfactory persons as censors or were to attempt to interfere with their decisions.    My advisors consider that there Is no danger to be apprehended on this score sine the immediate result of such a change of policy would be to impel the larger local authorities to enforce in regard to all films the detailed censorship which they now exercise in the case of films that have not  i&amp;ssod the central Board, and the utility of the trade censorship would be destroyed.The question of the censorship of films was discussed in the House of Lords on the 18th --lay last on a motion by Lord Danesfort.    The main criticism of the existing system then made was that the censorship of films in this country
Is left entirely to the trade -with the result that of the totsl number of films submitted only an infinitesimal number Tcers rejected and that a large number of films possessing offensive characteristics &apos; ere modified and passed Instead of being rejected in toto.     Lord Danesfort urged that the present system of a Bo*rd appointed and paid by the trade v;as nrong in principle and that there should be an official censorship appointed by the State. As I have tried to shov: in this memorandum there Is&quot; an effective answer to this line of attack, and Lord Danesfort did net press his motion.A good many criticisms of the existing system are based on ignorance of the proper functions of censorship. It is no doubt true that a considerable proportion of the films prepared for exhibition in this country do not reach a high standard from an educational artistic or moral point of vie?.-, but censorship cannot make good films out of bad-material and can do little to encourage the production of films of a high standard.     All It can do is to prevent the exhibition cf films which fall below a certain standard.Any debate no.&quot; held on the question of censorship Is more likely to centre round the desirability or undesirabil of what is known as politic?1 censorship.     As the law stends His &quot;ajesty1? Government hsve no po&quot;&apos;er to prohibit the exhibition of a film on grounds of public policy -such for example as the effect which a particular film may have oa international relations - but as I pointed out  in answer to a Question In the House of Commons on
the 16th Instant, the Government are entitled - and indeed it is the duty of the Government - to direct tho attentionof the licensing authorities to films where such considerations are involved so that the licensing authorities may give due weij/nt to them in coming to their decisionsDCensorship of any form of art is never popular and is always controversial.     The -censorship of stage plays by the Lord Chamberlain gives rise to many difficulties and strong representations have been made to n-.e by the London County Council that the position is anomalous and that censorship of stage plays should be handed over to the Iocq.1 authorities.     The censorship of films presents even greater difficulties in view of the part that the cincmato-graph plays in modern life, and that film exhibitions are given in conditions which often mate - it impossible for the audience to know in advance the type of film to be exhibited^Any proposal to alter the present system would involve legislation and would be highly controversial and I am of opinion that, unless it can be shorn - as it Las not yet teen shown - that the pre seat system, is unsa t is fact or y, it is sound policy quieta non movere.      In view of the fact that our opponents may attempt to make capital out of thio question at the London County Council election     I suggest that an opportunity should be taken cf announcing the Government^ decision before the election,.W    T VHome Office,February 29th,  1920.
