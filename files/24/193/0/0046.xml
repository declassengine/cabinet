JUST ICS BILL o Me morn rylumjj y^ the At t or noy -G e ner a 1D-This Bill contains a number of mis col lane ous provisions relating to the administration of justice, which are grouped in four Parts.The object of this Part of the Bill is to enable full and final effect to be given to the recommendations made in 1923 by the District Probate Registries Committee, of which Hr, Justice Tomlin was chairman, with respect to the re--organisation of those registries.     In 1923 the organ-isation of the registries remained exactly what it was whenthey were originally established by the Court of Probate Act in 1857.     The Committee recommended -(1)    that the registries should be regrouped so as toreduce their number from 40 to 11; (2)    that certain alterations should be made in the status and conditions of service of registrars and slerks employed in the registries. Statutory power to carry out the recommendations with regard to regrouping was obtained In the Administration of Justice Act, 1925.     But it has net been possible hitherto to make full use of these  powers, because the reduction of the registries necessarily Involves a considerable redaction of existing staffs, and if this reduction is to be effected equitably and without unnecessary hardship to the existing staff further statutory powers must bo obtained.     A scheme fox1 the purpose has now been agreed between the existing staffPart I.COPY HO
and the Government Departments concerned., end the first Fart of thi3 Bill contains the necessary provisions for enabling it to he carried out.Clause 1 defines the status and tenure of district probate registrars in accordance with the recommendations of ths Tomlin Committee.Clause 2 contains temporary provisions intended to facilitate the redxictlon of the existing number of registrars by allowing Increased gratuities to those who retire at one3Clause 3 defines the status of the clerks in the district registries, as recommended by the Tomlin CommitteeuClause 4 contains the legislative provisions which are necessary to carry out the agreed scheme in respect of superannuation allowances and gratuities to clerks aIt is estimated that the scheme to which this Part of the Bill gives effect will ultimately result In a saving of  19.C0G0 per annum,     The temporary increase of ben:-.f.:.ts proposed will, It is estimated, involve a non-re current payment from the Superannuation Vote of approximately  12.,500 and an additional payment not exceeding  1,400 in the case of pensionable registrars who retire under the scheme.Part II,This Part of the Bill contains a number of adminis-trative provisions designed to improve the machinery of the Courts.     Par&apos; the most part these amendments are of minor Importance and it is not necessary to refer to them specif&apos;ically0Part II?:.This Part of the Bill is in exactly the same form as the Judicial Committee Bill which passed the House of
Lords last Session.     A very similar Bill passed the House of Lords in the previous Session and received a Second Reading in the Commons.Clouso 13.     The object of this clause is to strengthen the Judicial Committee v;ith regard to the hearing of Indian appeals, which constitute about half the work of the Committee.     The clause provides that two qualified persons shall immediately be appointed members^s of the Judicial Committee with a salary of  2,000 charged on the Consolid     d Fuvrd.     They mast retire at 72 and will receive a pension of  ls000 per annum.     The clause further provides that the salary may be increased,  if the Indian Government think fit, by a sum not exceeding  2,000.      (The Indian Legislature passed last year a resolution approving the payment from the revenues of India.)     The persons appointed under the existing lav; with a salary of  400 will continue to receive that salary until they vacate their office, ar.-d thereupon the existing arrangements will cease to have effeot.Clause 14.     At the present time the number of qualified dominion judges who may become members of the Judicial Committee is limited to seven.     This clause proposes to remove the limit altogether.PART IV.This Fart contains a number of provisions which have little connection with each other.Clause 15 removes certain anomalies in the status and tenure of the Vice Chancellor of the County Palatine
.arch 26th,   1923.cf Lancaster.Clause 19 puts a father of an infant in the same position as the mother with regard to the Courts to which he can meke an application for custody.     The existing position under which a father must resort to the High Court,  ana has not the option of going to a court cf surnmary jurisdiction or a count-- court has been the subject of comment in the Courts and in the Press.PART VoClause 22 end the First Schedule provide for a number of amendments of the Supremo Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, and cf tho County Courts Act, I860, and for one in the Legitimacy Act, 1926. All these are either consequentlal on other provisions of the Bill or for the most part little more than drafting amend-rents.(INTLD.)    D.M.H.
