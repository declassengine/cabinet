SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 72 (28). TQ  BE  REpT  UNDER  LOCK  AND   KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken (o ensure the secrecy of this document.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERS PLAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE &quot;Plan&quot; put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his secret Memorandum (CP. 8 (28) ) is a noteworthy document. It envisages a comprehensive attempt to deal in one bold stroke with the whole problem of local government, to give a direct measure of assistance to productive industry, and. last but not least, to provide an election policy which will supersede the safeguarding of industry and the extension of Imperial Preference as the main constructive items in the economic policy of the Unionist Party.With the first aspect of the scheme as a solution of the finance of loeal government I do not propose to deal. I confess to some doubts as to the wisdom of wholly exempting industry from local burdens, as against substituting a more equitable form of local taxation on industry and commerce for the present rating system. A scheme of loeal taxation based on profits would, it seems to me, have the advantage not only of including commercial enterprise, which is little less unfairly dealt with by the present system than industry, but also of creating a direct local interest in the prosperity of industry. But there is much that is interesting and attractive in the scheme, on this side, and I will leave any criticisms or suggestions for modification to those who are more competent to make them.The second aspect of the scheme is, however, much more important and urgent. It marks a great advance that a financial proposal should emanate from the Exchequer with the avowed object of assisting the producer. The old slogan of &quot; revenue for revenue&apos;s sake,&quot; appropriate in far-off days when industry flourished exceedingly and public expenditure was, by modern standards, infinitesimal, has gone by the board, and we are exhorted to do something for &quot; the producer on whoso continued vitality the heart-beat of the nation depends.&quot; There can be no doubt that relief from rates would be an appreciable and in some
industries a substantial help to production. I, therefore, warmly welcome the proposal for the remission of rates (as apart from t h alternative method of raising revenue contemplated in tho Chancellors memorandum) as in itself a useful contribution towards an industrial policy and of some assistance to the farmer. But when it is seriously suggested that such relief can be made an alternative to safeguarding and form the basis of an election policy it is necessary to be quite clear in our minds as to the extent and effectiveness of the relief afforded, and no less carefully to scrutinise the effects of the alternative by which it is proposed to make good the loss of local revenue.The Chancellor of the Exchequer quotes certain calculations of the Committee on Trade and Industry indicating that the direct burden of rates upon industry averages about one-half per cent, on the cost of production, and that the cumulative burden, including presumably the effect of rates upon other industries and upon the cost of living, is approximately 1\ per cent, on the value, at works, of the finished product. Allowing for the &quot;national rate&apos;&quot; still to be imposed, that means an actual average relief of about five-sixths of one per cent. Even one per cent, may be helpful, but it does not go very far to bridge the gap between the wage rates paid by British employers as compared with those paid by their no less efficiently organised rivals, or materially to reduce the total burden of taxation spread over British production and not borne by foreign production which competes with it in our home market. The difference between British and Continental wage rates may be estimated at approximately, for skilled labour: British 100 per cent., German (Hi percent., French 52 per cent., Italian 43 percent., Belgian 33 percent.: unskilled : British 100 per cent., German 70 per cent., French 44 per cent., Italian 39 per cent., Belgian 29 per cent.1-&apos;The total estimated rates for 1920-27 were .1:179.948,000 ; the actual total of taxes for the same vear i&apos;G78,977.241; or an approximate total of 1*859,000,000.1 The great&apos;bulk of this falls directly or indirectly on British production. A reduction of i&apos;25,000,000 in rates, even if not balanced by new taxation, consequently can only reduce by a very small fraction the unfair preference at present enjoyed by foreign manufacturers in the British market.It is true that the Chancellor of the Exchequer calculates that if the remission of rates on railways is devoted by them to the reduction of their charges on certain basic commodities only, such as coal for ship-ment and industrial use, iron ore, limestone, pig iron, &amp;c. (and to that extent not used to help other industries), the total cumulative relief might amount to as much as 9s. or 10s. a ton on such products as rails and ship-plates.   That obviously is a substantial contribution to the* These figures are based on statistics published in the &quot;International Labour Review&quot; relating to a few representative trades and are at current rate of exchange, t The above figures do not include Northern Ireland.
problem in the case of those industries. We may then fairly sum up the position by saying that the Chancellors plan, on its positive side, while it does not affect the competitive industrial position as a whole to any really appreciable extent, and consequently does not affect the general ease for safeguarding, does contain the possibility of assistance to the iron and steel industry of sufficient importance to be worth seriously considering as a partial though hardly adequate I fear as a total  substitute for a safeguarding duty on basic iron and steel products.Unfortunately the Chancel lor&apos;s plan has its negative as well as its positive side. It is a plan for increasing taxes as well as a plan for reducing rates. It includes the imposition of a Liquid Fuel Tax raising from 1-10,000,000 in the first full year by f1,000,000 annually, as well as the raising, by a side wind, of an additional  8,000,000 a year of Income Tax now remitted owing to the deduction of rates from the computation of profits under Schedule I). The Liquid Fuel Tax will be in part a tax upon pleasure riding, and as such at first sight preferable to rates. Hut the greater part of it will be a tax on a form of transport; and power which has become indispensable to modern industry, and as such it involves a burden, no less cumulative in its effects than the rate burden, on industry as a whole, though no doubt: less in its effect upon the heavy than upon the lighter and more highly developed industries. From that point of view alone it is calculated to olTset very seriously such slight advantage as the positive side of the plan may offer to industry or agriculture as a whole.But that is not the only objection to the Liquid Fuel Tax, used as an alternative to rates. The motor industry, whether concerned in the production of pleasure or industrial vehicles, of motor-driven trains or ships, or of airships and aeroplanes, is destined to be by far the most important skilled industry in the world in our generation, as well as the predominant factor in defence. Our industrial and commercial supremacy in the 19th century was due largely to our supremacy in the making of railways, locomotives and marine engines. We started ahead of others at home, and subsequently British brains, British money, and in a large measure British labour, built and equipped the railways and mercantile navies of the world. To-day oil locomotion is displacing steam loconio-tion all over the world, and there is a field of almost illimitable possibilities open to us in the British Empire, and to a large extent in the outside world as well. 1 notice that at the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council Sir J. Thornycroft stated that &quot; the statisticians of the industry had calculated that if we had last year manufactured all the ears which we imported, and half the cars imported into Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, it would have meant employment for 110,000 more men during the year.&quot; When we consider the requirements of the rest of the Empire, and of South America and Eastern countries, where we are not excluded by high tariffs, as well as the continuous expansion in demand in17326 I! 2
the Dominions already referred to, there is no reason why the motor vehicle industry alone should not find direct employment in the next few years for another &quot;200,000 men, as well as indirect employment for a vast additional body of workers in subsidiary industries if only the industry is given a fair chance. That chance is being denied to it to-day by a system of taxation which practically prohibits the sale at home of the only type of car that is of any use in the rest of the Empire or in those foreign markets where we can hope to get a footing. The only car that is any good at all on the kind of roads which 1 have been driven over for the last six months is a cheap light ear of at least 20 h.p. like the Dodge or Chevrolet, the demand for which is practically negligible in this country owing to our absurd system of taxation by horse power. In an important memorandum on this subject the British Manufacturers section of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders state &quot;emphatically that the influence of the heavy horse power tax has made the manufacture of these types impossible for British manufacturers on such a quantity basis as to bring prices within a competitive limit.&quot; The memorandum goes on to point out that to secure any measure of stability in the industry the British manufacturer must be able to market a greater proportion of bis cars abroad, but that he cannot compete abroad, if his export model has no-market at home.I venture to say that: there is no greater contribution to British industry, apart from a general reform of our economic policy, that could be made to-day than the abolition of the t&apos;10,000,000 of the horse power tax. The imposition of a Liquid Fuel Tax in substitution of most of the t&apos;22,250,000 now levied on motor vehicles would be a well-justified measure. But the addition of such a tax while leaving the horse power tax, or indeed any other form of special taxation on this industry, seems to me disastrous unwisdom.A last objection, political this time even more than economic, is that it is proposed that a tax so open to criticism on merits, and likely to be as unpopular as it deserves, should be imposed for eighteen months before even a beginning is made with the remission of rates. An eighteen months diet of powder to precede the jam, with a general election between, may well dispose the public to look for the jam from other hands than ours.If the scheme is to be proceeded with, as I hope will be the case, it is essential to provide for the remission of rates to coincide with the imposition of alternative taxation, and to find an alternative tax or taxes less open to political or economic objections than a Liquid Fuel Tax imposed on top of the present motor taxes. An additional income tax or additional consumption taxes are hardly likely to commend themselves. Thei-e remains the possibility of duties on foreign manufactures, whether imposed primarily as safeguarding or as revenue duties. The amount of extra revenue required to make the scheme work from the outset, allowing

An eighteen months diet of powder to precede the jam, with a general election between, may well dispose the public to look for the jam from other hands than ours.If the scheme is to be proceeded with, as 1 hope will be the case, it is essential to provide for the remission of rates to coincide with the imposition of alternative taxation, and to find an alternative tax or taxes less open to political or economic objections than a Liquid Fuel Tax imposed on top of the present motor taxes. An additional income tax or additional consumption taxes are hardly likely to commend themselves. There remains the possibility of duties on foreign manufactures, whether imposed primarily as safeguarding or as revenue duties. The amount of extra revenue required to make the scheme work from the outset, allowing
for  13,000,000 of &quot; national&quot; rate, and for the  3,000,000 extra under Schedule D. is 1:25,000,000. On over  300,000,000 of foreign manufactures imported that amount could obviously be raised either by a flat 10 per cent, or by higher duties specially selected for their safeguarding effect where most needed. These duties would directly help the safeguarded in-dustries far more than the proposed remission of rates. -Judging by the example of industries already safeguarded they are not likely to add indirectly to the burdens of other industries by increased cost, but rather by increased volume of production and increased contribution to local and national revenue to reduce their burdens. But if there were any legitimate fear of disadvantageous indirect effects, the use of the revenue secured from the duties on the safeguarded industries for the remission of rates would provide a direct countervailing benefit for the industries which had not been safeguarded or insufficiently safeguarded. It might thus be possible to dispense with all but a very low safeguarding duty on primary iron and steel products, while the farmer&apos;s objection to industrial safeguarding would be met by showing him that it provided the wherewithal for freeing him from all rates.Such a linking up of rating reform with safeguarding in the Budget of 1029, on which we could go to the country, offers very great, political advantages. It is idle to think that the issue of protection for our industries can be indefinitely evaded. On the other hand there are great objections, both internal to our party, and based on election experience to a general raging, tearing campaign on the abstract issue of Free Trade and Protection. The only way of escaping being committed willy-nilly, and probably with inadequate preparation, to such a policy of frontal attack is by deliberately taking up a carefully chosen offensive-defensive position, if we can present in a budget, but not to take effect till after the election, a complete coherent scheme, where each section of the community can see what benefit they are to get out of it, and if we can get that scheme thoroughly discussed in Parliament and explained in the country before the election, then the battle will be fought on the scheme and not on abstract issues, and will be fought successfully. It is on these lines, too, that lies the best, hope of making any progress with the most important of all our economic problems, namely, the extension of Imperial Preference. While it may be impossible to add to the existing total of consumption duties, or to face an election on the abstract issue of food taxes, 1 see no reason why some rearrangement of our existing food taxes so as to benefit our farmers and enlarge the scope of Imperial Preference should not be perfectly feasible. We levy at present (1926-7; a total taxation of over L&apos;10,000,000 a year on Empire tea, cocoa, coffee and sugar. The remission of the t&apos;5,400,000 levied on the first three items alone would cover a 5 per cent, duty on the l&apos;100,00L),000 of dairy produce imported from foreign countries, and still leave the consumer with something substantial in his pocket, as well as with the satisfaction
of having participated in the creation of an Empire Free Breakfast Table, and of having given a real stimulus to agriculture at home, and to trade and migration in the Empire. Any such rearrangement could, under the conditions which I have envisaged, be accompanied by the most definite pledges that no further additions or increases would be made in the scheme of consumption taxes during the lifetime of the next Parliament.To sum up, I would suggest that, while the Chancellor .qf the Exchequer and the Minister of Health elaborate and perfect their scheme of rating reform from the point of view of local government, the proposed Liquid Fuel Tax should be devoted this year to the remission of the burdensome and wholly indefensible taxation at present imposed on the motor industry, and that between this and the next Budget the Cabinet should carefully study the whole question of the taxation, whether on a revenue or a safeguarding basis, of our manufactured imports, as well as the possibility of a rearrangement of our consumption duties, with a view to embodying our final conclusions in a coherent, constructive scheme of economic regeneration. As the Chancellor very truly observes : &quot; We have to choose between a positive constructive policy or just carrying on &quot; and I would add &quot;carrying on to disaster.&quot;L. S.
