Memorandum by tho President of the Board of-Trade.It will be remembered that in 1926 a Committee was appointea under the safeguarding of industries procedure to enquire into an application for a duty on hosiery and. knitwear of cotton or wool.   The report of the Committee was circulated with my memorandum CP. 289 (26) of 27th July, 1926.The   Committee did not recommend the imposition of a duty at the time but suggested that the case might be further considered if the importation of cotton hose and underwear continued to increase and at the same time the volume of unemployment in the industry grew.At the end of last year I re-appoirtcd the Committee to consider, having regard to their previous report, whether the present position of the industry was such as to justify the imposition of a duty, and I now circulate the further report which they have submitted. Para. 14. The Committee re-affirm their previous finding that itis only in the case of cotton hose and cotton underwear that there are abnormal imports, and they find that only in the Para.18. very lowest grade of these articles are the prices of foreigngoods below; those at whioh British Manufacturers oan profitably compete.
vl*ft . IS .ra.27.V u AThe percentage of unemployment In the hosiery industry generally is low, and although unemployment may be somewhat greater In the cotton goods end of the industry the Committee report that they would not feel justified in recommending the Imposition of a duty on1cotton hose and cotton underwear even if they were entitled to regard them separately.     Moreover, it is difficult to regard the manufacture of cotton hose and underwear 99 separate and distinct sections of the hosiery industry since it appears that most British manufacturers make hose and underwear Indiscriminately of various fibres, and that machines and workers also change from one class of yarn to another as the demand fluctuates.Having regard to all the circumstances, therefore, the Committee do not recommend that at the present time any duty should be imposed.I circulate the Committee^ report for the information of my colleagues.     It is laid down in the &quot;Shite Paper that safeguarding duties will only be imposed if the Committee have reported that a duty ought to be imposed.     I therefore do not recommend the imposition of a duty, and propose to publish the report in accordance ?/ith our established practice just before the introduction of the Budget.P.

* See Appendix.BOARD OP TRAPS.,    SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. (---------SECOND REPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE OH HOSIERY.The Rt. Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lioter, K.B.S., M.G., M.P., &amp;c, President of the Board of Trade.1. We were re-constituted aa a Cocimittoe under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure on tho 7th November, 1S27, to consider whether, having regard to our Report dated the 10th July, 192G,  (Cd.2726), the present position of the Hosiery and Knitwear Industry is, or is not, such as would justify tho imposition ox trny (end if so, what) import duty on Hosiery and Knitwear cf cotton or wool.2. We havo held ton meetings, eight of which have been public sittings.    Evidence has been heard from 27 witnesses1&quot;, 14 being called by the Applicants (tho national Joint Industrial Council of tho Hosiery Trade) and 12 by the Hosiery Trade Group Committee which again opposed the application. The remaining witness was called at our special request and was not associated, with either side.    Several witnesses who appeared before us at the previous Enquiry gave evidence on the present occasion.3. Mr. H.R. Allard, tho Secretary of the National Joint Industrial Council appeared for tho Applicants and Mr. A.S. Comyns Carr, K-C. and Mr.CP. Entwictle, instructed by Messrs.Stikeman end Company, on behalf of the Opponents.4. Prom the Memorandum submitted by the Applicants it was apparent that as previously a duty was claimed on all classes of hosiery and knitted goods if of cotton or wool or containing such proportion of cotton or wool as would entitle them to be classified as &quot;chiof value cotton&quot; or &quot;ohief value
20 &apos; j 0 0wccl&quot;.   Articles of ;silk Bnd artificial silk were again specifically excluded from the scope of the Snquiry.   On this occasion the Scottish manufacturers of Hosiery were definitely parties to tho application.5. In our last Report we recommenced that if the imports of Hosiery and Knitwear continued to increase in the future and such increase was accompanied by an extension of the volume of unemployment in the industry, the Applicants should be afforded a further opportunity of putting forward their case.    As far as possible, therefore, the present Enquiry ha3 been confined to these two main points of imports and unemployment and to any new factors or developments which had arisen in the meantime.    Consequently wo do not consider it necessary to cover afresh the bulk of the ground already traversed in our previous Report or to restate at any length the main arguments put forward by both sides which were recapitulated in that Report.    It will be an advantage, however, tc refer briefly to the specific questions on which we are asked to report, as indicated in Section   of the White Paper Cd.23 7.7/hether the applicant industry is by reacon af the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates? or by reason of too nature of the goods produced, an industry of substantial importance.6. It was agreed at the previous ^inquiry that the Hosiery Industry both by reason of the numbers employed and also on account of the nature ox the goods produced was of substantial importance, and since the date of our Report thero has been an increase in the numbers employed.    In July 19S5 there were 97,550 persons registered under the Insurance Acts as being employed in the hosiery industry,  of whom 22,130
were males and 75,400 females.    3y July 19E7 the figure had increased to 101,190, made up of 22,190 males and 79,000 females.(2). ,&apos;iVhether foreign goodc of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported into, and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom, in abnormal Quantities.7. Plainly from a consideration of the relative import figure a we came to the conclusion in 1926 that cotton stockings and hose and cotton underwear were being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.   Since that date the preliminary figures of the Census of Production for 1924 in so far as they relate to the Hosiery industry have been published, and as regards these two particular items - cotton hose and cotton underwear -these figures help to confirm the Yiew we then expressed.8. The retained imports of cotton hose during the years 1913 and IS20 to 1927 are as follows:-I   Total Quantity.Total Value.Dozen Pairs.1913 1920 1921 1922 1925 1924 1925 1926 192?662, 243 1,487,598 562, 5601,059,102 1,683, 399 2,110,187 1,698,790 2,606, 273 3, 270, 566237,917 1,609,7071, 278.98 3394,190 435,058 560,115 695,471 616,953 941,0909. Detailed figures in respect of cotton underv/ear arenot available prior to 19 20 but the imports from that yearonwards are as follows:-
2P f&quot;&apos; 1)..)! (	I                                                     t i                          i Total Quantity.;		Total Value.		!

Brom the above two tables it will be seen that since our Report in 1926 the imports have increased in both olasses of goods.      According to the Census of Production, 1924, the total quantity of cotton hcse produced in this country was 4,400,000 dozen pairs so that even allowing for a corresponding increase in che British output sinoe 1924 the imports still represent nearly 50 per cent, of the British production,    oirailarly the production of cotton underv/ear in 1924 in Great Britain is givon as approximately 4,000,000 dozens so that in cotton underwear the imports represent about 40 per cent, of the British output/11,    Tho opponents contended that a substantial proportion of the increase in the imports of cotton hose during 1926 ana 1927 was due to a temporary demand for fine gauge lisle hose which v/ae only obtainable in Germany but that this demand had now almost ceased owing to the substitution of artificial silk: ho8e for lisle hose.   The figures relating to the imports from Germany of. cotton hose show that there has been an appreciable decline during the last half of the year 1927 but on the other hand the imports from other countries, particularly Italy and Czecho-Slovalcia are steadily increasing and it may bo that part of the
decline in the quantities supplied by Germany is due to Iosh of trade by Germany to other countries, which for economio reasons are now able to supply  at cheaper prices.12. The Ceneua of Production for 1924 demonstrated tiiat the estimates of output as put forward at the last Enquiry wore much too low.   The Applicants estimated the total production of all classes of Hosiery in 1925 at  22,875,000 of watch  9,575,000 was Fancy Hosiery (i.e. knitted outerwear).    We suggested that this figure should be inoreased to  25,000,000 but the actual figure as shown by the Census of Production was  42,470,000 of which approximately  10,000,000 was represented by Fancy Hosiery as distinct from Hose and Underwear,     The Census also 8 ho wed that tho output per head, without allowance for unemployment, was about  451 per annum instead of  350 per annum aa estimated in our previous Report.13. The imports of woollen hoee and underwear, fancy hosiery and knitted gloves are so insignificant when compared with the British production that notwithstanding their tendency to increase in certain oases we oannot regard them as abnormal within the meaning of the White paper.14. We therefore reaffirm our previous finding that only in the case of cotton hose and cotton underwear are goods of the olass or description to which the application relates being imported into or retained for consumption in this country in abnormal quantities. (3) Whether foreign p;oociB so imported are being; sold or offered for sale at prloos whion are_below the prices at whichsimilar goods can bo profitably manufactured or produced in the United kingdom
9 e n. fw  w   415. As et *the first Enquiry various samples oi foreign goods, particularly cotton hose and cotton and merinc (i.e. mixture of wool and cotton) underwear were produced by the Applicants, which, according to costings supplied by them, were being sold in this country at prices below those at which similar goods could profitably be manufactured in the United Kingdom.    As before, cheap cotton hose came principally from Germany, Italy, Czecho--Slovakia and the United States of America, and cotton underwear from Germany and Japan.   Reference has already been mads to the submission of the Opponents that the increase in the imports of cotton hoso from Germany since 1925 were mainly due to the temporary demand for lisle h03e and in. this connection it is interesting to note that the average value per iozen pairs of the imports ox cotton hose from Gijrm&amp;ny rose from Ss.6d. in 1925 to 10s.7d. in 1925 and 11s.lid. in 1927, which fact tends to show that the increase in imports from that country were in comparatively expensive goods.    The imports of cotton hose from Germany declined appreciably during the latter half of the year 1927 and during that period also there was a decline in the quantities supplied by America.    On the other hand there were during 1927 considerable increases in the imports from Italy and czecho-Slovakia.16. Conclusive evidence was placed before us, that since the previous enquiry the margin of difierence between the prices at which foreign goods were being offered in this country and those at which similar British goods were obtainable had been narrowed considerably.    Per example, it was proved to our satisfaction that one important British firm were now able to compete successfully against
the very cheap cotton hose imported from America which was referred to at acme length in cur first Report.17. Difficulty again arose in obtaining information aa to the cost of production in this country of strictly comparable articles, the British goods being invariably of better quality and finish then those imported.   In many cases different kinds of material are used, ss, for example, in Japan whera very cheap yarns spun from Indian cotton are used in making low grade underwear, whereas yarns of such a type are not used to any extent by hosiery manufacturers in this country.18. Having regard to all the circumstances end in particular to the development which has occurred, in tho British industry since our previous Report, we are inclined to the view that only in the very cheapest and lowest grade articles of hese and underwear are foreign good3 being sold or offered for sale in this country at prices below those at which British manufacturers can profitably compete. (4) Whether by reason of the severity and extent of suchcompetition employment in the sanufactura or production of such goods in the United Kingdom is being or is likely to be seriously affected.IS. As already indicated the total number of persons engaged in the Hosiery industry has increased since our last Report by over 3,500.    In 1SS5 the Ministry of Labour returns showed that the average percentage of unemployment during that year was 8.4.    In 1927 the figure had dropped to 5.75,* there having been a continuous decrease during each month.   As on the previous occasion the Applicants submitted that, o.s practically all workers are employed on pi ace rate3, there was a considerable amount of under-employ-ment which was not registered wi-ch the Employment Bxchaxges.. rthia
(aroec partly through the praotioe of sharing out work: and the running as a result of fewer machines per head than would be possible under more favourable conditions and consequently the Ministry of Labour returns did not fully represent the unemployment position.    The situation is further complicated by the fact that the machines are interchangeable and separate figures are not obtainable in respect of ootton and wool, it being generally admitted that the silk and artificial silk hosiery trade was comparatively busy.   The Applicants attempted to show that serious unemployment existed in the cotton hose and underwear sections of the industry by means of returns of idle machinery in the trade which was capable of making these goods.    From these returns the Applicants calculated that full-time employment could be found for 449 additional men and I,S31 additional women in the production of cotton hose and 427 additional men and 3,601 additional women in making cotton underwear.    We are satisfied that to some degree this is probaoly the case, although not to the extent claimed but the percentage cf unemployment in the whole industry is so lew that reference after making due allowance for the somewhat greater volume of unemployment which is shewn to exist so far as manufacture of cotton goods is concerned, we feel that wo should net bo justified in recommending the imposition of a duty on these particular goods,even if,under our terms of reference,we ware entitled to regard them separately.    Our conclusion in this respect is strengthened by the difficulty of considering the manufacture of cotton hose and underwear as separate and distinct sectiens of the Hosiery industry.    So far as wo were able to ascertain most firms in this country make hose and underwear indiscriminately of either cotton, wool, silk, artificial silk or mixtures of these fibres.    Further, the
(   &quot;same machines are capable of making articles in any of these fibres and the workers themselves change from the use of one class of 3-arn to another es the demand fluctuates.20. &quot;&quot;e, therefore, return a negative answer to this question  and affirm that, in our opinion, enploy:r\ent in the manufacture or production of the goods to which the application reletes is not et present being seriously effected, nor was sufficient evidence put before us to satisfy us that serious \uienployment Is likely to arise in the future. (5) T/hether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair.21. Iractically no new evidence as to wages conditions abroad was put before us on this occasion it &quot;being admitted that the wages paid in certain countries from  which competition cones are lower than in this country.     It v/as indicated, however, that during the last two years the wages paid In Germany had Increased considerably.       It was again 7iiaintained by the Opponents that the output per operative in certain countries, especially America, was considerably higher than in the United Kingdom, although the actual wages paid in the United States of America T.7ere as a rule higher than In this country.      In the case of one Important American firm situated in South Carolina and shipping large quantities of cotton hose to this country the wages were stated to be about the same as In the Leicester district but in addition certain social amenities such as free housing, etc. were provided by the Company.22.   We remain, therefore, of the opinion previously expressed that the actxial wages paid in certain of the competing countries abroad are lower than those obtaining
9*7 &apos; i x(In the United Kingdom and are of such a nature as to render competition from those countries unfair within the meaning of the &quot;Tilte Paper.(6) Whether the applicant Industry is being; carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.23. Cn the previous occasion we reported that in our opinion the hosiery industry in this country was being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy and this view is now conf irmed by the development which has talcen place in the industry during the last two years.     T7e are satisfied that the industry has progressed appreciably during that period, and that it is now in a better position to meet foreign competition than it was in 1925-6.       The questions of mass production and the cost of dyeing and finishing to 7/hich we drew attention in our previous Report have received the serious attention of the trade and we are Informed that considerable economies in production have resulted in consequence.     The evidence put forward by both sides showed conclusively that the British hosiery manufacturers are fully alive to the necessity of keeping their :-rorks up to date and of supplying the newest designs and colours demanded by the public.     This fact coupled with the skill of the workers no doubt accounts for the low percentage of unemployment throughout the Industry.(7) whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other industry; being an industry using goods of that class or description in production.24. The position in this respect remains exactly as before^e, there being no industry which depends on the products of the hosiery industry for Its raw material,
and consequently the imposition of a duty on importod hosiery and knitwear would not exert any adverse effeot on employment In any other industry. (6) Whether, having regard to the above conditions, theapplioant industry has, in the opinion of the Committee. established a claim to a duty, and if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition.25. The Applicants claimed a duty wtv the rate of 3373 per cent, ad valorem on all classes of hosiery and knitwear of cotton and wool or of mixtures containing these materials, if sufficient to bring the goods uncier the description &quot;chief value wool&quot; or &quot;chief value ootton&quot; as the oaee might be.    The Opponents, on the other hand, contended that the imposition of any duty on certain claeses of hosiery and knitwear would result either in an increase in price to the ultimate consumer or in the cessation of the demand for the goods altogether, and that in neither event would any benefit accrue to the British hosiery manufacturers.    As regards the main bulk of the goods covered by the application, however, we are satisfiea that British manufacturers are able and in fact do compete suocessfully, and that, only in a limited number of very cheap low-grade lines, are they unable to do so.    In the higher class goods and more especially in wool, the British industry occupies a predominant position and enjoys a very substantial export trade.20. V/e are of opinion therefore that only with regard to cheap aotton underwear and to a leaser degree cheap ootton hose (including half hose) have tho Applicants made out a case in accordance with the regulations laid down in the White Paper.   Me cannot, however, regard the manufacture of these particular goods as a separate seotion of the industry for the reasons already explained nor do we consider that the position with regard to these two classes is sufficiently-IS-
exceptional to warrant their being accorded special treatment. V*e would further point out that in the event of the imposition of a duty on cotton hose and underwear, serious administrative difficultiea would, arise in tho case of goods made of mixtures of cotton and other materials.27. Having regard to all tho circumstances we do not recommend that at the present time any duty should be imposed on the class of gooas to which the application relates.28. Before olosingwe should like to place on record our appreciation of tho way in which tho case was put before us by both sides.    The arguments and facts both for and against were put forward in every case with great fairness and without prejudice and a most helpful atmosphere prevailed.29. Finally, we desire to thank you for again placing at our disposal the services of iir. W. Graham, as Secretary, and to express our appreciation of the groat assistance he has given us in aealing with this difficult case.(Sgd.)  Jas. 0. Calder.(Chairman).(Sgd.) Arthur Hollins. (3gd.)
