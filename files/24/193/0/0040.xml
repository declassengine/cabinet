1 n o1 ^ memorandum on banking incident negotiations.The Manking negotiations now turn on two points:-(1) whether any reference to the &quot;bombardment&quot; of Nankins or to treaty revision should he allowed in the agreed exchange of notes forming a settlement of the case and(8) whether there is any guarantee of adequate or indeed any reparations.Prior to Sir 1:1. Lampson&apos;s arrival in Shanghai preliminary negotiations had taken place between Sir S. Earton and H*uang Fu on the lines of arranging for an exchange of notes and for the issue of Mandates regarding punishment of the culprits and protection of   the foreigners.    Sir M. Lampson was warned on March 8th against allowing any mention of the bombard-ment or treaty revision to he made in the agreed ex-change of notes.      He comminicated these objections to Huang Fu and pressed without success for some con-crete scheme for payment of reparations.   Finally fail-ing to move Huang Fu on either point Sir M. Lampson agreed to recommend His iviaiesty&apos;s Government, to   agree to the inclusion of a reference to bombardment and treaty revision provided Huang Fu would satisfy him in regard to reparations.   Huang Fu having thus secured his points proceeded to draw up with Sir M. Lampson the drafts of notes   to be exchanged and the proposed :.Ia.nclates, but in subsequent conversations on reparations he refused absolutely to communicate officially in writing any reparation scheme that might be agreed to. The most that he would agree to was an advance of  20,000 to be divided among the injured Powers, andvague..........
vague promises of more to follov/ - this sum however to be kept a strict secret from the other Powers, and this concession to be made not to us specifically, but in the form of draft instructions to the Chinese and British Assessment Comraissioners. In spite of the ob-viously unsatisfactory nature of such a settlement Sir hi. Lampson recommended setLling even on these lines as the lesser of two evils.   He was informed on March 14th most clearly that the proposed terms were objectionable and humiliating, more especially the references to the firing and treaty revision, while the proposed settle-ment gave little concrete satisfaction.   In his reply of I/iarch 16th Sir 1,1. Lampson in effect said that His Majesty&apos;s Government must either accept these terms or face the most alarming consequences.   The rapprochement with the South would be abruptly terminated, the Kationalists would   be throvm into the arms of the Com-munists and take up a hostile attitude towards us on all questions such as the salt gabelle, customs administra-tion, Hankow, etc., etc. where our material interests were affected.   Without waiting however to hear whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were convinced by these argu-nients or not he commu.communicated His Majesty &apos;s Government&apos;s objections to Huang Fu with a view to seeing whether a settlement could not yet be patched up.   The result is a characteristically Chinese manoeuvre on the part of Huang Fu.   He has published the mandates on punishment of culprits and protection of foreigners - obviously with a view to forcing our hands - but refuses to alter in any way the objectionable draft notes.   He hashowever........
however promised a more substantial sum, namely,  30,000 as a first payment on account of reparations and stated that a very cordial reception awaits Sir M. Lampson at Nanking and the best house available there is being prepared for the residence of Ills Majesty&apos;s Consul-General.   This, however, is a promise not cash.   In the meantime it lias transpired that the -Americans and Japanese --rere not disposed to accept terms which savour-ed of humiliation.   Nevertheless Sir M. Lampson again strongly recommend?: acceptance repeating his arguments as to the dire consequences to our material interests that would result from refusal.We are still however sceptical as to the conse-quences of which Sir M. Lampson warns us, and we remain of the opinion that whatever the consequences may be we cannot accept a settlement which would be a humiliation. The position is one of extreme embarrassment but we might perhaps find a way of escape by agreeing to aban-don the proposed exchange of notes altogether. We could then accept the spontaneous issue of the two mandates as evidence of the Nanking government&apos;s desire to accept and discharge their share of responsibility for the out-rage and to prevent such outrages in future; we could also recognise that the honours about to be paid to Sir M, Lampson at Nanking and the preparations for the return of our Consul-General are something in the nature of a public apology and gesture of good will.   Such an arrangement, however, would have to be subject to Sir M. Lampson&apos;s being satisfied that the offer of  30,000 is confirmed by the Nanking government.This.....
This suggestion which seems to he the best way out of this embarrassing position is embodied in the an-nexed draft telegram,PAR EASTERN DEPARTMENT, FOREIGN OFFICE.March 19th, 1928.
?(\91*  \J  hKtDraft telegram to Sir M. LampBon, (Shanghai).Your telegrams Nos. 35 and 36.I fully appreciate the very embarrassing nature of these latest developments reported by you, as well as the fact that a break now may produce a far more serious situation.At the same time nothing in these developments has occurred to alter our fundamental objection to the terms of the proposed exchange of notes in so far as they concern the humiliating reference to our firing at Nanking and to the wholly extraneous matter of treaty revision.   These terms I cannot possibly defend here, and I therefore regret that in spits of your urgent appeal I am unable to authorise you to sign them.There is however one other course which I am ready to take, not because I think it satisfactory but in response to your very strong insistence on the necessity for an immediate settlement of the incident on almost any terms,I am prepared to regard the spontaneous issue of the two mandates as an indication of the Nanking Government&apos;s desire to accept their share of respon-sibility for the incident and to prevent such incidents in the future, and I am also ready to recognise that the preparations now being made for your reception and Mr, Hewlett&apos;s return to Nanking are something in the nature of a public apology and gesture of good-will. If therefore the Nanking Government will confirm to your/
(2)your satisfaction their initial offer of  30,000 and agree to drop the whole question of any exchange of draft notes, I authorise you to proceed to Nanking and instal Mr. Hewlett there, leaving him to carry on any subsequent negotiations in regard to the question of reparation.You will of course realise that even in making this concession I shall be open to great criticism especially in regard to the financial aspect of such a solution of the incident.   I must therefore also insist that in the event of the Japanese and United States Governments securing more favourable terms in any respect His Majesty&apos;s Government will reserve their right to claim similar treatment.

Lamps on (Shanghai)19th March 1928.D.     10.35 a.m. 19th March 1928.R.      9.CO a.ra. 19th March 1928.No:-     (R).xxxxxxxxxxxxIMPORTANT.Following for Secretary of State;-Personal.. May I emphasise tc you personally how really -   important acceptance cf Nanking settlement is.     Terms may not he what we should wish, hut the time to get better passed in 1927.Huang pleaded again and again on March 17th that we should help him in his struggle to save China and his party from intrigues of the Third International who will make full use of any failure with us.All of us here agree that it would be the greatest mistake not to settle and that such an opportunity is most unlikely to recur.     I do earnestly hope that arguments I have submitted officially may convince His Majesty&apos;s Government.
From   CHIN;-..Decypher.Loi/ip s on (Shanghai)18th Ltarch 1928.7.30 p.in.18thMarch 1928.3.0C p.m.18th March 1928.No, 36,xxxxxxxxxx1.     I spent three hours with Huang Fu last night and explained fully and forcibly the attitude of Hie Majesty*s Government towards proposals as laid down in your telegram No. 21,2.     He replied by recounting his efforts at Nanking to secure acceptance of proposals by his own government,, There were still members of party councils who objected to any settlement with British Imperialism, while others were not convinced that a question which had remained in (? gp. omt,) for a year need be settled nov/ and it had required all the influence of Chiangs KaUshek, (?Tan)Yen.-kai and himself to persuade council that unless a settlement were reached it would be increasingly difficult to cope with the persistent efforts of the third international to keep China estranged from the Powers and especially Great Britain^ Even so he had been attacked for not insisting en compensation for dtsmage done to Chinese by firing at (? gp. omt.) and other places.3.     He had published the two orders without refer-ence to me because he felt it was a case of publication then or never and any attests now to secure an alteration of texts of draft notes which had now been passed,/
-3-procured the best house in Nanking for Mr. Hewlett and had it newly furnished and fitted in every respect and General Chiang Kai-shek was postponing his departure in order to take part in my public reception.6.     He made it clear that he honestly could do rs) more and he appealed to me to beg His Majesty1 s Government to accept proffered settlement on these terms on the ground that a breach now, after all that had passed, and publicity which had inevitably been given to the negotiations and to preparations for my expected visit to Nanking v/ould mean a serious setback to the movement towards better relations generally now gathering impetus and a corresponding gain to extremists and their Russian sympathisers.7.     After the fullest and most careful consider-consideration of all the arguments for and against, I feel bound to record my opinion that it would be a serious blunder to refuse the terms as now offered.8.     I feel very strongly that while acceptance can do harm and may do much good refusal will certainly do a great deal of damage to our present and future relations with Nationalist China while as regards the North (see Peking telegram to me No.103) we shall never get better or even as good terms as those now offered and I would therefore beg that I may receive instructions to accept them.9.     Huang is remaining in Shanghai until the night/

Texts are substantially as agreed upon but word &quot;killing&quot; is changed to &quot;dying&quot; in first paragraph and word &quot;said&quot; is omitted before &quot;troops&quot; in second paragraph of C.2. Native press cf last few days has been anticipating that I would visit Nanking and to-day&apos;s papers contain a report of arrangements proposed for my reception v/hich have been reproduced in foreign press while Reuter and Toho messages from London and Peking have further strengthened belief in imminence of settlement.3.     I have of course made it clear throughout the whole of discussions that everything was subject to your approval but at HuangJs request based on ground that complete absence oi facilities for entertainment at Nanking rendered maximum notice necessary for dis-cussion of form which my visit should take in the event oi a settlement being reached (? groups omittod).

(1) Proposed settlement is open to obvious strong objections.     I fully share dislike of references to firing (not &quot;bombardment&quot; as stated in your tele-gram) and to treaty revision (though our reply on these points seems to render them fairly innocuous) and reparation proposals are admittedly rraaatisf ac-&quot; tory.    But we must make allowance for difficulties of present Nanking government whoe as specifically stressed in their draft preliminary note, are not parties directly responsible for incident of last March,(2) Question resolves itself into one of balance of advantage.     Is it better to settle on terms now offered us or to break off and leave the matter in an indeterminate state?(3) Any terms we   get now are bound to be in the nature of a compromise.    His Majesty&apos;s Government could only get really satisfactory terms if they v/ere pre-pared to take a strong line and have no dealings whatever with Nanking government pending a settlement, even if they reached Peking and installed themselves as government of all China.    Both practicehilityand/
and wisdom of this attitude strike me as very doubt-ful.     We must also remember that others may settle ahead of us.(4) Your telegram suggests more dignified course might be to allow incident to sink into oblivion. But is that possible?    Quite apart from question of reparation, the choice is not. as may be thought in London, between settlement and mere oOing back to point at which discussions began.    The rapprochement which has led up to these negotiations has been so public that their failure is almost bound to have a definitely unfavourable reaction on cur relations generally.(5) Even in conditions postulated in paragraph 5 of your telegram, I am not convinced of desirability of allowing consul general to return to Nanking before a settlement is reached.(6) The question for consideration seems to me not so much precise nature of present proposals as whether we are prepared to risk the alternative. This risk is not one lightly to disregard.     I have already briefly indicated its naturo in paragraph 7 cf my telegram No. 25, but, it is sufficiently import-ant to warrant repetition.     It is true that positive advantages to be expected from a settlement are difficult to estimate;   but failure to settle may have far greater repercussion than His Majesty&apos;s Government perhaps realise.     Such questions as customs, Hankow, Shanghai municipal representation, salt, etc., willall/
all be effected;   end the position of our nationals and their interests in the South prejudiced.     There is also danger (to which I myself attach vital import-anc8) that nationalists, disappointed in us, may again turn elsewhere for support and guidance.(8) I am anxious not to exaggerate and it is all a matter of opinion - hut Communist party is still said to he the best organised party in China.     T.VW Soong has emphasised to me that they constitute a very real menace,,     The question therefore at issue is not merely settlement ox&apos; Nanking incident.    We may in a sense have reached turning point in our relations with all Nationalist China.     When Soviet agents were expelled from Nationalist China in December last there was a natural pressure towards other foreigners partly due to restricted Soviet friendship and partly to a desire for assistance from  omeone.     This pressure lead to improvement of relations with foreign-erB generally at Canton, Hankow, Shanghai and other centres with an accompanying revival of confidence and trade,(9) By failure of these negotiations this rapproche-ment will be checked if not, destroyed and just at the moment when sincerity and value of His Majesty&apos;s Government policy is beginning to be realised an atmosphere of suspicion and disappointment will re-place one of budding confidence,,    The reaction at such a critical turning point is bound to be far reaching and will be exploited by forces of intrigue and disorder to possible permanent detriment of whole position/
9 )position in this country (10) I have ventured to develop these aspects of the question at sane length rather than to deal in detail with specific points raised in your telegrem because it is right that His Majesty&apos;s Government should realise that results of a break are likely to be as serious if not more so for us as for Nationalists and generally moro far reaching than might prima facie appear to be the case.     But that is not to say that 1 like the terms before us any tetter that Bis Majesty&apos;s Government do a(11) Huang Pufs confidential agent is calling on me this afternoon and as soon as I know the latest position I will telegraph again and endeavour ts make final recommendations., It seems premature to put forward (? gpD omt0) until I know whether Nationalists have endorsed terms as they now stand.Addressed to Poreign Office, repeated to Peking No. 83 and Tokyo No. 16,
