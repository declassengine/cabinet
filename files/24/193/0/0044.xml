Printed for the Cabinet.   March 192S.SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 95 (28).CABINET.BILL TO AMEND EMPIRE SETTLEMENT ACT. 1922.Memorandum hy the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs HOPE the Cabinet will agree to support Mr. Somerville&apos;s Bill to amend the Empire Settlement Act. 1922, subject to certain necessary amendments, and will sanction the introduction in Parliament of a financial resolution covering the charges involved. Certain schemes for relieving the situation in the mining areas have recently been discussed with the Industrial Transference Board, and are, I understand, being favourably considered by the Board. By means of these schemes it is hoped to move between now and next spring 10,000 or 12,000 miners, partly single and partly men with families, from this country to the Dominions. But unless the Empire Settlement Act is amended as proposed, these schemes cannot be carried through.I circulate herewith a copy of the Act as it will appear if the amendments which I think necessary are approved by the Cabinet and carried in the House of Commons.Three changes of some importance are contemplated, viz. : (a.) To allow of agricultural training schemes for the purpose of training men in this country for agriculture at home as well as overseas.(b.) To enable the dependants of men who are being trained under such schemes to draw allowances during the period of training. . (c.) To enable the Secretary of State to contribute up to the whole cost of agricultural training schemes under his control or administered by a Government Department. Under the Act as it stands, the Secretary of State may not contribute more than half the cost of any scheme.With regard to training schemes not under Government control, two alternatives are submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet (see proviso (b) on page 3 of the attached copy of the Act). Under Alter-native I the Secretary of State will be able to pay up to three-quarters of the cost where the scheme is administered by a Public Authority, but only half the cost where the scheme is administered by any private organisa-tion ; under Alternative II the Secretary of State will be able to pay up to three-quarters of the cost of schemes administered either by Public Authorities or by private organisations.The object of (a) is to facilitate recruiting. Men do not care to be trained for agriculture, if their only chance of employment in agriculture after they are trained is overseas and thousands of miles from home. Moreover, Labour leaders find it difficult to support a policy of training for agriculture which holds out no hope of work on the land in this country. Their attitude is at present a very real obstacle to recruiting, especially in the&apos; mining areas. The amendment will also be of convenience in the case of training institutions which are assisted by the Oversea Settlement Ollice, where trainees normally go overseas, but where a boy might occasionally get work with a farmer, and where at present a refund would have to be made of the assistance given.

Doininions Office, Downing Street, March 21, 1928.It is unlikely that there will he any appreciable number of openings for land work in this country, and the amendment will involve the Exchequer in little if any additional expenditure.It should be noted that no power is taken to create land settlement schemes in this country.The object of (6) is to enable funds to be provided for the maintenance of the dependants of a man who is in training under an agricultural training scheme, thus bringing this training, which has in practice hitherto been available only to single men, within the reach of married men. If a man is employed before going to a training centre, he obviously loses his pay while at the centre; if unemployed he forfeits his unemployment benefit. Therefore, his dependants cannot live while he is away being trained.The amount fixed for allowances, viz., fifteen shillings for a dependant adult and two shillings for every dependant child, is based on the rates payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts to a woman who is the working head of a family and her children.(c) will enable the Secretary of State to contribute up to the whole cost of an agricultural training scheme in this country where the scheme is under Government control. The whole cost of training is at present being defrayed by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the two experimental centres which have been established by the Ministry of Labour at Brandon and Claydon. The amendment would enable the Secretary of State, to pay for any centre started in this country by a Government Department, and also to contribute more generously if the first alternative is adopted to centres started by a Public Authority, or if the second alternative is adopted the centre started either by the Public Authority or by private enterprise.One object of this amendment is to make it more easy to train during the short &quot;rush&quot; period from March to May, when Canada&apos; is prepared to take agricultural workers in large numbers.No training hostel can be run economically unless it is open all the year round and is able to place its trainees overseas as and when trained. The turnover of agricultural trainees is strictly limited by the absorptive powers of Australia during the autumn and winter months, when the Canadian ports are closed to British migrants.By this amendment a cheap but effective form of training might be arranged with private farmers, &amp;c, in late winter and early spring, to meet the Canadian demand.It will be seen from the above that the cost to the Treasury under (a) is likely to be negligible, and that under (6) and (c) payment will be by results. The extra cost of training a man with a family, as compared to a single man, will be about  10 per family, while training of Canadian spring migrants with farmers should not cost more than  8- 10 a head.L.
