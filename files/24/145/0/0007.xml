APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT, No.  LXVII                                      RUSSIA.    CAPTAIN HICKS&apos;  report on  tiie prisoners of  war in Siberia is perhaps not soreassuring as it might  appear.  The reasons siibmitted are as follows :  If the Bolsheviksare as impotent as accounts show them to be it seems unlikely tnat they will be able to restrain the  prisoners if they make a determined  move.  The fact  that  in  spite of allopportunities of tampering with the prisoners the Bolsheviks have only been able to winover 1,500.does not augur well for Bolshevik propaganda in Germany or Austria.                                    BULGARIA.    The friction between Bulgaria and Turkey continues and is to be noted.   It shouldhe remembered that all Turkey&apos;s assets, Panturanianism, Panis.lam.ism, and the Caliphate,all really depend on  Turkey&apos;s unfettered hold over the straits, and Bulgaria is the onlyreal permanent menace now or in the future to that hold.                                   PALESTINE.    The political  news  from Palestine is good.and has cleared the situation.Dr. Weizmann&apos;s  speech  is useful                        &quot; MORNING  POST &quot;  AND  PALESTINE.    The &quot; Morning Post &quot;  has thought fit to publish  a tract which emanates from thePickthall group of Pro-Turks.  The only  effect  of this  tract  can  be  to  hamper  our administration and cause unrest among Moslems.   The tract  is calculated to this end,and the &quot; Morning Post&quot; is only pursuing its usual policy in publishing it.                                  MESOPOTAMIA.    Though not mentioned in the  report,  the  occupation of Kirkuk is of political importance, as it puts us in touch with large masses of Arabs and Kurds  whose hostility to the  Entente depends  on fear of Russia  rather  than on affection  to Turkey.Opportunities may now  offer.

Mr.  Lockhart  telegraphed [No. 129] on the 27th april the following radio sent by the People&apos;s Commissariat for  Foreign Affairs to the GermanMinistry for Foreign  Affairs  on  the 26th  April.   Relations which exist between  theRussian Soviet Republic  and the  German Empire established by Brest Peace:-TheRussian Government has  taken every measure possible  to fulfil the  treaty strictly, soto secure  for  its  people the  chief aim  of the  treaty, a  state of peace.   But  in reality no such state  exists.   In  the south of the Russian Republic there is a further advance northwards of German troops, with detachments of Ukrainians, advancing uponKursk and Voronezh, territory undoubtedly Great Russian.   They  have crossed intothe Crimean peninsula.   That frontier line which was: one-sidedly,  established by  theUkrainian Rada itself and officially made known to us by the  German Government hasbeen infringed by German  and  Ukrainian troops.  Simultaneously, in  the north of&quot;Finland Russian military property is being seized  by the White Guards, detachmentsoperating in agreement with German lauding  detachments and under instructions fromthe German general staff.  In order to fulfil the provisions of the Brest treaty, the legalbasis, that is, of the relations between Germany and Russia, the Soviet Government hasofficially declared its readiness to open  immediate negotiations  with  the UkrainianCentral Rada.   No answer,  however, has come from that German-directed Government.The German Government itself having likewise  proposed the question  of a treaty ofpeace has not replied to our offer  to  open negotiations.   Instead,  as  has  already been pointed out, there  has  been  a continuous advance of  German and Ukrainian troopsagainst  Russia.   In these  circumstances,  the  Soviet  Government considers itselfcompelled  to  mobilise   all   necessary  forces in  order  to  secure   the   freedom  and independence of the  Russian  Republic,  now  menaced  within the frontier establishedby the treaty of Brest.   It is evident that such  a state  of  things  cannot continue forlong.  The Soviet Government considers  that it  is indispensable to throw more light
Op this matter ;  and, with  a view to securing peace,  affirms its complete readiness to fulfil the conditions of  the  Brest  treaty.   To-clay  when  the German  Ambassador waspresenting Isis credentials to the Russian Government, the Soviet Government, expressedits assurance that he would undertake, by all possible measures, to make his Governmentdeclare definitely whether  it considered the conditions of the Brest treaty still in force ;and, if so, what measures it  meant  to  take to  stop  the above-mentioned militaryoperations which  openly  threatened  peace  between  Russia and  Germany.  If  theGerman  Government  considers it impossible  to  maintain the conditions  ratified by both  Governments, it is  absolutely  necessary  to establish  with  precision  the- newdemands  in  virtue of which  the  German  Government  is  directing   Ukrainian,Finnish,   and German troops  against the Russian  Soviet&apos; Government.   A preciseand clear answer to these questions is absolutely necessary, and the Russian Governmentexpresses its hope that that  answer will  be such  as  to create a possible basis for thepeace so  fervently  desired by the  working  classes  of Russia whose  most cherishedaspiration [? is peace] among all nations. (Signed)  CHICHERIN.    The German Ambassador. In the same  telegram Mr. Lockhart  said  that CountMirbach  had presented his credentials to the Russian  Government on the 26th April.He had not been received by M. Lenin but by M.  Sverdloff as President of the  CentralExecutive Committee.SIBERIA.    The Prisoners of War.-  On  the 26th April Mr. Lockhart transmitted  [No. 127]a message from Captain Hicks giving a summary of the  conclusions resulting from hisinvestigations in Siberia.   He got as far  as the  Manchurian frontier, visiting en routeOmsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Chita, and a number of smaller places.  He found that thenumber of armed prisoners had been absurdly exaggerated ; after a diligent  search heonly found 1,200 in all Siberia.    The Soviets were convinced that there were not morethan 1,500 reliable prisoners  of Bolshevik views in the country, and had, therefore (?),guaranteed that the number [? of arnied prisoners]  should not exceed  that number.Each  individual had  been  carefully  selected  after  thorough investigation ;  for  theBolsheviks were quite  alive  to the  danger of indiscriminate  arming.   There  was no evidence of any plot having  for  its object  the  organisation of the prisoners by their officers as a menace to  the Allies or to  Siberia.   In  fact the worst  relations  existedbetween  the officers and  their  men  in  the prisons.   Practically  no  Germans  werearmed, and very few of them had joined  the socialist  organisations.    In  explanation of the difference between the results arrived at by  himself and the reports furnished bythe allied consuls  and others in  Siberia, he could  only say that their reports containedat the best information having a basis of  truth  but  highly exaggerated, at the worstmelodramatic rumours; and  this was to be attributed to  the  consular  representativeshaving allowed their anti-Bolshevik feeling  to cloud their judgment, and, from lack oftime and inclination, having made  but little, if any, attempt to properly examine  theinformation that came  to their notice.                                   ROUMANIA.    Signing  of the Treaty of  Peace. -Renter, telegraphing  from Amsterdam on  the7th May, said that  according to an  official telegram from Bukarest, the treaty of  peacehad been signed that  morning.  It would be known as the Peace of Bukarest.   the text would be puldished shortly.                                   BULGARIA.    Relations with Turkey. -Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne  on the 1st  May[No. 683] that the military  attached  department had learnt that the Turkish minister in Berne had announced that Helfferich was soon going to  Constantinople and Sofia inorder to  adjust  Turco-Bulgarian  differenes.   He  said that the trouble had  been caused in the first instance by Germany having promised that she would pay all  Bulgariansexpenses for  military purposes when she entered the war.    When the Dobrudja was taken from  Roumania, it was handed over to  the CentralPowers jointly ;  and Bulgaria was told that, if she wished to have the  whole of it afterthe war,  she  must  pay  a part of her military expenses  during the war.
     Bulgaria had agreed, to hand over the Gumuldjina district to Turkey, on condition that she received Drama, Seres, and Cavalla, as well  as  the Dobrudja ;  but now that turkey had  grown  so  much  more,  powerful through her occupation of the Caucasus,Bulgaria did  not  wish to hand over the Gumuldjina district to her, unless  she  receivedSalonika and other territory in return.     Bulgaria had agreed to the free navigation of the Danube by Austria.                                   PALESTINE.     The Greek Easter Eve. General Clayton telegraphed on the 5th May [P.  65] that whereas in the past disorders had almost invariably occurred  between the Greeks  andthe Armenians on Easter Eve during the ceremonies in  the church  of the Holy Sepulchre,on which occasion it was customary to provide a guard of no  less than  600 soldiers forthe maintenance  of the peace, tins year, on  the  4th  May, when the ceremonies tookplace, thanks to the tactful management of the heads  of  the Greek and  Armenian com-muuities by the military governor,  Colonal llonald Stores, C.M.G., the ceremony  passedoff without any  sign  of  disturbance, though  no guards were  employed beyond theordinary police.     Moslem Pilgrimage to the Tomb of Moses. On the 2nd May General Clayton tele-graphed [LB. 1313] that the  annual pilgrimage to the  tomb of  Moses  had taken placeOn the 26th April without disturbance. -  The military authorities had given every help,and an  excellent  impression had been produced in  Moslem circles.     Armenian  Refugees [E.R. LXV[, p. 6].-General  Clayton telegraphed on the6th May [P.  86]  that every effort was being made to  rescue Armenians, and so far over600 had been so rescued in the country east of Jordan.   In addition to these  betweenforty and  fifty had come to Jerusalem as a result of the  occupation of Tafilaby theSherif Feisal : there were still a considerable number in  the Kerak area-, which had notyet  come under  his control.   It was hoped that arrangements would shortly be madefor moving those  rescued to the Armenian  refugee camp  at Port Said.     A Moslem View of the Future  of ZJaZesZme.-According to the &quot; Morning Post &quot; ofthe 6th May, members of the Moslem community  resident in England  have submittedto Mr.  Balfour, as Secretary of State, a representation of the  feelings of the Mussulmansubjects of Bis  Majesty in regard to the future of Palestine.   They point out thatthrough a period  of  1,800 years the followers of Judaism have had no vestige of claimto  the  land  &quot; of which they  had possessed  themselves some centuries  before  theirdispersion by the slaughter and despoilment of its original inhabitants.&quot;   They submit that during 1,300 years, excepting the short Interruption when the Crusaders held thecountry, the  Moslems  have acted with justice and toleration towards other creeds and peoples  ; indeed,  that  the Jews have always enjoyed greater toleration, good-will, andrespect  in Moslem lands than  in most Christian  countries.   But as regards Palestine,they protest  against any proposal  to place Jews in  a privileged position in respect  tothe other  comrounities,  &quot;the  spirit  of  exploitation, for which the  Jewish  race  issingularly distinguished,&quot; being likely to  bring them into collision with their neighbours.For these and other reasons  given, the petitioners submit that, &quot; should it be considered necessary,  under the  right of  self-determination, to create  an   autonomous  state  inPalestine, with Jerusalem as its capital, it should be a Moslem state, with a council  con-sisting of members representing the Jewish, Christian,  and Moslem communities in propor-tion to the number of their followers,  with equal rights and status for all its citizens, andequal opportunities  for free development  without artificial political backing  for any onecommunity.&quot;     Dr. Weizman on the Future of Palestine. General  Clayton telegraphed  on the1st May jNo. LB. 1301] that  an official dinner at which Dr. Weizman, leader  of the zionist  Commission, was invited to meet  some of the principal  notables of Jerusalemwas given on the  27th  April.   Among the  quests were representatives of the Latin,Greek  Orthodox, and Armenian  communities,  and the grand mufti  of  Jerusalem.After the  lving&apos;s health  had  been drunk the governor explained that, in view of themisconception and misapprehensions which were rife,  advantage had been taken of their presence in Jerusalem to enable Dr.  Weizman to  enlighten the various communities  ofPalestine as to the aims and intentions of the commission.
     Dr. Weizman  said he  spoke with a grave sense of responsibility.  Id e wished to-speak of peace,, harmony,  and co-operation between the communities there  represented.On the spot where he was now standing  his ancestors had stood twenty centuries ago.Thence they  sent  forth  their great  message,  almost, like bread cast  upon the waters,and now the waters were  bringing this bread  back to their  descendants.   They wereunited to-night  under the wing of the mightiest of the  world&apos;s Powers, one which&apos;  wasfighting for the great ideals rooted in the love of the old prophets of Palestine ;  hereJewish seers  and poets had  proclaimed  the universal ideals of justice and peace;  herethey were the guest of  the  greatest of the Bible-loving  nations, a  great nation whichhad told them  in its  declaration that the work accomplished in Palestine  centuriesago had not been forgotten.   Truly it  was  not all accident :  it was destiny.  Though  born in the remote  North,  be was not a stranger to Palestine, nor was any one of his scatteredbrethren.  Their forefathers  had heroically  defended their right to the sacred country,and it &quot;was only  after being  overwhelmed  by a fate more  cruel  and sanguinary even thanthe  present fate of  Belgium and Armenia that they had  lost a physical hold  on palestine ; but their ancestors  did  not relinquish their claim to it, and  instead  of apolitical Palestine they set up a moral aud intellectual Palestine -which had triumphantlyresisted  the   onslaughts  of  every conceivable  foe.   They did not therefore come to palestine,  they  returned  to it;  returned to link up  the glorious traditions of the pastwith the  future in order to  create once more a great moral  and  intellectual centrewhence perhaps a new world would come forth to a sorely-tried world.     A centre  such  as that must have real props, must have roots in and derive strengthfrom the soil of Palestine.   Zionists desired therefore to create conditions  under whichthe moral  and national development of  those  of the Jewish  people  who had freelychosen to come to Palestine would be rendered possible ;  a development which wouldnot be to the  detriment of  any  of the great  communities already  established  in  thecountry, but, on the contrary, to  their advantage.  There was  land enough and roomenough in Palestine to sustain a population  many times larger than the present  one.All fears expressed, openly or secretly, by the Arabs that they were  to  be  ousted fromtheir present position were due either to a fundamental  misconception  of Zionist aims and  intentions or to the  malicious activities of their common enemies.  Morally andmaterially it was to &quot;the mutual  interest  of  Jew  and Arab to live in friendship  and peace; only then would the development of the  country be possible.   Jewish colonistsbad shown that  even  under the deadening Turkish regime they were capable  of trans-forming  desert places into  flourishing villages :  how much more then would be cloneunder civilised conditions  and under a, just and strong Government,     This was a sincere  expression  of  Zionist  aims.   He warned them  against  allmisinterpretations and false allegations.   They were not to believe those who insinuatedthat the Jews intended  to  take  the  supreme  political  power  of Palestine into their hands  at  the end of war.   He knew  too well the burdens and responsibilities  ofgovernment, and Jews aud  Arabs alike had carefully watched  the fate of Albania andof Russia.  Self-government in modern times was a  complicated  science which no  one could learn in  a day : it would need a long and hard  apprenticeship under  well-trained and  trustworthy teachers.  Zionists  declared that they desired  the supreme political authority in Palestine to be vested in a civilised democratic Power to be selected by theleague of nations,   lie desired that this Power should hold Palestine in trust until  thepopulation became capable of self-government.   He wished to say that  Zionists did  notbelieve that the  internationalisation of Palestine, or any partition thereof,  or  any formof dual or multiple political control could  benefit  or  be tolerated in the  country.Palestine  in its  integrity  must  have one  just  and fair responsible guardian,  and only one.     Zionists, he went on to  say, watched  with the deepest sympathy and  profoundinterest the struggle for freedom  which the ancient Arab race was waging.  They saw the scattered Arab  forces  being cemented with  the sympathies of the freedom-lovingPowers ; once more they saw rising a strong and regenerated Arab political organismwhich they hoped would revive the glorious traditions of Arab science and literature somuch akin to their own.   This  kinship found  its  most glorious expression in  theSpanish period of Judseo-Arab development, when the best Jewish  thinkers wrote andtaught in Arabic as freely as in Hebrew.     To the north the Armenian  nation,  which  at the present moment was  paying abloody toll to  a cruel  enemy, would rise triumphant  to claim  justice and the right to live  in peace on  the soil which was being  drenched with  the blood of its best sons.    Tothis nation, too,  bis heart went out, and  he  felt that the three  nations, Arabs, Jews,and  Armenians,  had perhaps of all nations the highest claim to  a life  of their  own, a
life of feeedom and peaceful development.  Destiny had chosen these three nations toguard the classical  gate into the ancient  world against the Turanian  hordes  which,armed with the deadliest of modern destructive weapons, were being organised by theirtaskmasters.   Jews were already feeling the effects of the new menace;  the Armenianmassacres in the Caucasus and fresh Jewish massacres  in Turkestan should serve as a warning to them all.  They should teach Arab, Jew, and Armenian to  stand together to resist by all means in their power the forces  of darkness and oppression which nowthreatened to  overwhelm the civilised world.     If this guard of freedom stood united, Palestine might look  forward  to a  future as great as its past.   It would become the link between East and West, interpretincj one tothe other  and  harmonising their different but not opposing conceptions of life.  Zionists-asked, therefore, for  an opportunity for free national development  in Palestine,  and injustice  their, demand should- not be  refused.   They  wanted  to  cultivate that long-neglected  land with modern methods and under a just  economic system, avoiding thesocial evils from which even the advanced countries of Europe were only  now beginning to free themselves.   He wanted also to make Palestine once more a  fountain  of know-ledge and idealism through the  creation of a Hebrew  university, a  great  intellectualcentre open to all mankind, in which the ancient truths of the  prophets would againobtain expression in a modern form.   In  all this work, intellectual and  agricultural,Zionists would not be injuring their neighbours  in Palestine; on  the  contrary, theywould be  helping them to  a richer  and&apos; a  fuller life.   He asked  his hearers  not to )underrate the  measure of Jewish help.  The  eyes of his scattered people were fixed on palestine  and  on what Jews were doing  there, and the Jewish communities of  the Westwere not without influence in the counsels of the  nations.   The  city of Jerusalem  was for the Jews a holy place,  and for that reason they were able to  respect the sentimentsof others for whom, too, Jerusalem was  sacred.   They  wished to  interfere  in no way .with  the  Holy Places, to which the hearts of Christians  and Moslems turned withreverence.  Zionists  wished  to live in  Palestine at peace with all on a basis of  mutualregard and mutual respect.     Dr. Weizmans  speech was received  with  applause.   It was translated  by thegovernor  into  Arabic for the grand mufti, who made a sympathetic reply, in which he stated that he was convinced of the sincerity of the Zionist declaration, and  hoped towork hand in  hand with the commission for the good of Palestine.                                    ARABIA.Asia.     Financial help  for  Idrisi. In  reply  to  Sir R. Wingate&apos;s  telegram  of  the19th April. [E.R. LXV, p. 3], Mr. Balfour  telegraphed on the 4th May [No. 607] thatthe grant  of a sum of 10,0001.  in payment of arrears had been authorised, but that forthe monthly allowance 10,000L must be adhered to.     On the previous day Sir R. Wino-ate had  telegraphed [No.  772] that he  hadreceived Major Reilly:s report.   He had found Idrisi anxious to furnish information and accounts.   Customs dues,  grazing fees, and land  taxes  furnished his revenue  in  mormal times, but now all was seriously affected;  rain and the troubled state of the countryreduced the receipts from  land taxes  and  grazing  fees, whilst  our naval  blockadeseriously diminished the customs dues.  He owed 140,000 rupees to Aden merchants for supplies, and  another 120,000 to Meidi merchants, irom whom he  had  borrowed that amount to meet  urgent liabilities.  All tribesmen had to  be paid when serving outof the home  district : on  the Abys front he had  some  3,000 levies, and  in the Loheiyadistrict he was  paying about 4,200  tribesmen.   Idrisi was much depressed  by  hisfinancial difficulties ;.  there was no doubt either as to his needing more money, or as tohis spending it, if granted, in fomenting tribal activity against the Turks.  In thecourse of  the past six months he had  only received 35,000L from us in cash.   .  The  Bent Yam, In  the  same  telegram  Sir R.  Wingate said  that  the  Hashidtribesmen had been replaced by the Beni Yam.  The former had left after the reverse atEl Mur and the capture of Loheiya.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     Nejef [E.R. LXVI,  p.  5].-On the  5th  May, the Political  Officer  at  Baghdadtelegraphed that Hati Atiyah and, with insignificant exceptions, all other ringleadersand malcontents,  about 100  in  number, were now under arrest.   Something under a       [898-94]                                                          C
third  of the  rifles  demanded  had  been  surrendered;  in due course,  the fine of50,000 rupees together with  the rest of the rifles, or a  monetary payment instead,!would be collected.&apos;  Food had  been sent into  the town, and the blockade had been raised.   An excellent impression had been produced by the successful  outcome  of themeasures which had been taken.                                   TURKESTAN.      Report  of  an  American   Representative.  Lord  Reading  telegraphed  from  Washington on the 2nd May [No. 1958] that the text of a telegram from an American  representative  had been  communicated  to  him  by the  Secretary  of  State.  The  telegram was  dated the  24th  April.  [From a  telegram sent  on 23rd  April  from  Moscow by Mr. Wardrop it appears that the American representative was Mr. Harris,  representative  in  Russia of the  National  City Bank, and formerly  for  many years  consul-general  in the American consular service.]      Mr.  Harris  said that he  had spent  eight  weeks  on the investigations of the  conditions of Turkestan, and he considered the  situation in that  region very serious for  the allies.  In February 3,000 natives had been massacred at Khokand, and in the  following month many  had been, killed  in. and  near Bokhara.   There were  30,000,  Austrian  aud  8,000 German prisoners of war  in  Turkestan ;  and many of them had  been armed  and had  taken part  in  the movement  against  Bokhara.   The present  misrule was very oppressive to the Moslem population,  which numbered some 12,000,000.  The natives of  Persian Turkestan and  Afghanistan were  being systematically taught,  by  German  agents and prisoners, and they  should make [?  the German Emperor]  their friend aud  [?  the protector]  of Islam.  The  same Teuton  methods  as had  undermined Russia  were being used,  and in the  opinion  of Mr. Harris  British India  was menaced.                                    PERSIA.     New Cabinet. Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on  the  3rd May  [No. 374]  thatSamsam-es-Sultaneh had formed a Cabinet as follows :  Satnsam-es-Sultaneh, Interior ;Mushav-er-ut-Mamalek,   Foreign  Affairs ;  Mushar-ul-Mulk,  Finance;   Mushav-us-Sultaneh,  Posts  and  Telegraphs ;  Muin-ul-Vezareh,  Commerce ;  Hakim-ul-Mulk,Education;   Na,ssir-ul-Muik, Justice;  Amir  Mufakh  Khan,  War;  Must-es-HaredDowleh, without portfolio.     In another telegram [No. 375] sent  on the same  day  Sir C.  Marling said that astrong belief that Vosuk-ed-Dowa would  shortly take the place of  samsam--es-Sultanehhad prevented better men from joining the Cabinet, which consequently was somewhat less satisfactory in its composition&apos;than he had  hoped.     Farman Farma. On  the  27th February Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No.  158]saying that, on more than one occasion, he had been approached  by Farman Farma  inregard to bis fate should the situation  collapse.   Nizam-us-Suitaneh  had  received alarge sum of  money and a guarantee of indemnity should his estates be confiscated, andFarman Farma looked for like treatment.     On  the  27th April Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No.  224]  to Sir C. Marling sayingthat he  agreed  that it was desirable  to give  the necessary support to anyone who had worked  with  us as Farman Farm a had done; he  presumed  that  his  Highness had  inmind his possible  recall by the Persian Government, -should  it  throw in its lot with theenemy, and the seizure of his estates. Mr. Balfour said that he should be  glad to knowSir C. Marling&apos;s views on the subject.     The latter telegraphed on the 3rd May [No. 377] suggesting  that in  the  event ofFarman  Farma being obliged to  leave  Persia, he  should  during his  exile have an allowance of  20,000?. a year, together with a promise that our influence should  be  usedto obtain restitution of his estates in the case [? of forfeiture].     He  would  also  suggest an allowance  of  10,000Z. a year with a similar undertaking in the case of Farman Farma&apos;s son Firuz, to whom we were  under  obligations.   He wasvery  much  embarrassed  on account of. not having,&apos; received the  revenue from hisproperties  in Azerbaijan, which the democrats were threatening &quot;to confiscate.  Sir  C.Marling  therefore recommended that Firuz should have an immediate gift of 25,000tomans.  Salar Lashkar  could  defend the interests of the  other  members of FarmanJFarma&apos;s  family.
    Smuggling of Arms. Captain H. T. Jones, intelligence officer on the Persian Gulf,has made the  following report on  the smuggling  of arms and ammunition  on theTangistan coast: Attention has been drawn during the past few months to the repeatedcases  of smuggling of arms  and ammunition into Tangistan from the sea.  In eachreported case the place of landing was Dilwar, some 22 miles south of Bushire.  Dilwaris not situated immediately on the coast, but  there is a creek of shallow water runningup between the villages of Gainak and Dilwar.   Dhows are brought up this creek andunloaded there.  It is of course more than probable that other ports further down thecoast are also engaged  iii this arms traffic.  For instance, on a recent  occasion a dhowbound for Shiru was wrecked at Kaugun, and among other cargo salvaged were  2,000cartridges, &apos;303.  As, however, all my  information refers only to smuggling at Dilwar,I propose for the present to deal with  that place alone.  [Captain Jones then gavedetails  of the  smuggling for each of the last six months of 1917-18.  In  all,  he hadknowledge of the smuggling of 91 rifles  and 124,000 rounds of ammunition.]    One of the men told me  that the arms and ammunition and other contraband wereloaded  secretly in Koweit, and the boat then lay up and waited for a favourable wind.Given the latter, the voyage from Koweit to Dilwar took between twenty-four and thirtyhours.-  The  arms had generally been concealed in cargoes  of dates, but on  someoccasions ammunition bad been hidden in tea.    According to one of the  boatmen, rifles and ammunition  are brought into  Koweitfrom the interior, and are said to have been stolen from or  sold by the King Husseinsforces, and not as was at first thought,  brought down from Mesopotamia.    In regard  to preventive measures, Captain Jones says : Information of the landing of arms has so far been forthcoming from Dilwar after the consignment has been actuallylanded  and removed further inland.  In  any case,  even  if  we were able to obtain information of projected  landings  before  the  dhows actually  arrived,  it would beimpossible to take any action from the land side.   Preventive action is at present onlyfeasible either on the sea, or on the  port of origin :  and all evidence to hand see ms topoint to the latter being Koweit.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                  PALESTINE.    The Zionists. General Clayton telegraphed on  the 7th May that less talk  againstthe Zionists was reported, a fact probably due to the better understanding promoted byDr. Weizmanns speech [see p.  3] and to the  facilities which had been  given  for thepilgrimage to the tomb  of Moses.  Bishop  Porphyrios had conveyed a very friendlymessage to Dr. Weizmann  and the Zionist commission,  from the Greek orthodoxcommunity, through the military governor  of Jerusalem.    German Schools. In the same  telegram General Clayton said that the Zionistcommission had agreed to take over the Hilfsverein  schools.  Entente catholic  institu-tions would provide  for  children from catholic schools ;  and  arrangements were  beingmade for the taking over of the protestant schools.    Native Feeling. General  Clayton  also said that according to information receivedthere was a growth of feeling favourable to King Hussein and the British among theArabs east of  the Jordan extending so far north as Damascus.  The progress of SherifFaisal was eagerly watched.
