APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No. LXXIII.                                     RUSSIA.    THE only satisfactory point in the Russian news is that the Russian prisonersreturning may act as anti-German propagandists.                                    TURKEY.    It is difficult to estimate the value of the news regarding the reported insurrec-lionary movement iu Turkey.   There are large numbers of deserters in the mountainsli various parts, and such bodies are apt to coalesce, but not much effective  action can11 e expected from them.                                   PALESTINE.    The interview  between S her if Feysal and Dr.  Weizmann  is of importance and hould prove a satisfactory landmark.                                    PERSIA.    The  situation  does  not improve.  The  definite  invasion of Persia by the Turkspay  possibly  influence  the sentiments  of  the Persians in  our direction,  but thelisorganisation aud problems of the people forbid our gaining much by this.

On the  6th  June  Mr.  Lockhart  telegraphed  [No. 255,received the 17th June]  that Bolshevism as a force was  rapidly losing ground, thatfamine was sowing discontent among the peasantry and the workmen, and that  on  all sides counter-revolution was  raising  its head.     A week later M. Trotsky sent the following wireless  message  (countersigned  byM. Aralov) to all Councils of Deputies, and to all detachments of the Red army :      Soldiers of  the Red army ! the enemies  of the  workmen  and the  peasants have risen in revolt.  The  Ex-General  Krasnov is re-establishing on the  Don the Tsaristorder of things, and is opening the door for a foreign invasion.  The criminal mutineer,Dutov,  is acting as a leader against  the  workmen and peasants of the Urals.  Darkbands, agents of foreign  capitalists, by bribery  have raised the Czecho-Slovaks, whowere our war prisoners, in mutiny against the Russian workmen and peasants on the don, on the Volga, in the Urals, and in Siberia.   Landlords, plutocrats, and reactionarygenerals have raised their heads again.   The  Revolutionary Socialists of  the Right andthe Mensheviks  are with them.     To you, soldiers of the Red army, the Council of the people&apos;s Commissioners gives the order to crush these  counter-revolutionary mobs, and to annihilate these enemies ofthe people.  In  all  your detachments there must  be order  and discipline.  All ordersgiven by the commanders must be  obeyed unreservedly.   I order  all commanders  toreport to me all cases of treachery and  of cowardice, and,  at the  same  time, all casesof revolutionary heroism and cases which  merit military distinction.  I will publish the names of such traitors and of all such men of merit for the general knowledge ofthe  whole  country.  Let every  town, every village, every section of workmen andpeasants in Russia know who is a traitor  and who is  an honest and  faithful son of thepeople.   Cowards and traitors must be thrown down and annihilated.  To  help theworkmen and peasants will be an honour  to all honest men  of All-Russia.     Long live the Red army of workmen and peasants !      &apos; [898-100]                                                          B
2     The Blach Sea Fleet. On the 12th June the Commissioner for  the Navy sent the following wireless message  to the Chief Commissioner of the Fleet, Novorossiisk :      The People&apos;s Commissariat for the Navy has received the following ^communication from the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, dated  the 10th June :      In the note  of the 23rd May sent to our representative loffe, Baron kuhlmann laid down the  following  conditions -:  the German Government categorically demands the return of all  our ships from Novorossiisk to Sebastopol.   German troops on the whole Ukrainan front will not advance over the boundary  line, as indicated in the note, if our ships  return  to  Sebastopol within  a  period of  either six or ten days, as we  prefer. Germany recognises the right of property of the  Russian Republic in  these  ships, and she declares that after the conclusion of a general  peace they  will  be  returned to Russia.     In his message  of  the  6th June  to Count Mirbach, Baron Kiihlmann  delivered au ultimatum to us  demanding that our reply should be at Berlin before 7 P.M. on the 14th June.   Having regard to the constant  difficulties in our communications  with Berlin, we have given Count Mirbach an early reply.  In his message Baron kuhlmann agreed to guarantee that before a general peace was concluded Germany  would not use the ships, which should return from Novorossiisk  to ^ebastopol.  As the return of our ships from Novorossiisk  to  Sebastopol is  a fundamental  condition  of all  further  agreements between Germany and  ourselves  for the cessation of hostile action and  for negotiations, the People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs begs  the Supreme Naval Collegium to order our ships at Novorossiisk to return to Sebastopol.     With the  above  communication  was  enclosed the  following statement by the president of  the Council of the People&apos;s   Commissioners addressed  to the People&apos;s Commissioner for the Navy : In accordance with  the  circumstances explained in this letter  by the  People&apos;s Commissariat  for  Foreign  Affairs and the  decision of  the Government,  I order the  People&apos;s Commissioner for the Navy to direct without delay the naval  command  of the Black Sea fleet to  return the  warships  of the Prussian Councils Republic, which are at  the present time  in  the waters of Novorossiisk,  to Sebastopol.     In accordance with these requirements, the Collegium  for Naval  Affairs of the People&apos;s Commissariat for the Navy orders you to take without delay all necessary steps for the transference of the  warships from Novorossiisk to  Sebastopol, so that this work may be completed before the 10th June.     On  the  15th June,  M.  Trotsky sent another  wireless  message ordering  the immediate return of the fleet to Sebastopol: We  will explain and confirm for the last time  the order  given  for   the  immediate  return  of the fleet from  Novorossiisk  to Sebastopol, where they must remain until the end of the war as inviolable property of the Russian Republic.   Only fools or criminals  will act againsc a direct order  of the Soviet Power issued by many millions of workers and peasants.  The  15th June is the latest day allowed for the  execution of this order.  We direct  the commander and the General Delegates Meeting  to take measures for  the immediate  execution of the order. ....        - O&apos; -          O     Danger of a Pro-German Counter-Revolution. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 11th June [No. 272] that the danger of a pro-German counter-revolution was imminent; and that he had received information regarding  Germany&apos;s plans for  carrying out in Moscow a coup d&apos;etat similar to that in Ukraina.   It was naturally difficult to rightly estimate this disquieting information;  but  he had obtained  it from  various reliable sources, and had  eceivecl information of other  German activities  which  gave colour to it.     Exchange of Prisoners. Mr.  Wardrop telegraphed  on  the 5th  June  [No.  390, received the 15th June] that he had received a report on the exchange of  prisoners of war from Mr.  Dukes of the  Y.M.C.A., who had been at Orsha.   He said  that 50 per cent, of the returning Germans were thoroughly fit for service, and some 1,500 of them passed through Orsha daily ; they were well dressed and looked well fed.  The Russians who were exchanged were nearly all cripples or invalids, and  their ntimbers were  only from a half to two-thirds of those of the Germans; they had no money, were in  rags and badly shod, their only clothing was on their  backs, often they were without under- clothing, and the  Germans at the frontier stole their cloaks.  They took a great interestin the war and insisted on its prolongation ;  their hatred of Germany wais  intense and
their spirit admirable.   For the most part they particularly detested the  Red Guards,but their detestation extended to the Bolsheviks in general.SIBERIA.     Administration in Irkutsk. On the 14th June Sir G.  Greene forwarded [No. 627]a telegram  in  which the military attache in Tokyo  said  that the administration inIrkutsk was entirely in the hands of ex-convicts, who on the  7th June had  sent  a hundred ex-officers to forced labour in the mines.   The military attache had been asked by.General Dobrajanski to telegraph this with other items of intelligence.-     Anti-Bolshevik Movement. On  the 17th  June  Mr.  Hodgson telegraphed  fromVladivostock [No. 63]  that  the American consul at that place had been informed by hisconsul-general at Irkutsk that  he had found, on a recent journey of investigation, tha,ta counter-Bolshevik movement was in progress throughout  Central Siberia.                                    TURKEY.     Insurrectionary Movement in Anatolia. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed from  Athenson the 16th June that the following semi-official statement  had been issued there:      It is learnt from trustworthy sources that  Essad Pasha has now joined the insurrec-tionary movement  which has broken out from Tyria and Baindir (31  miles south-east of Smyrna) to the Bay of Adramit, the garrison  of which place  has  also joined themovement.  The rebels, who at  first remained on the mountains, are now  appearingfreely in the towns.                                   PALESTINE.     King  George&apos;s Birthday. General Clayton  telegraphed on the 15th June that onthe King&apos;s  birthday the various military governors had held receptions, at which therewas a considerable display of loyalty and enthusiasm.   Among those invited were somevillage headmen ; this, which had been highly  appreciated,  had increased the headmen&apos;authority.     Recruiting for King Hussein&apos;s Army. In the same telegram General Clayton saidthat the  attempt made at Beersheba to recruit Arabs for King HussehTs army had notbeen successful.THE ZIONISTS.     Meeting of Dr. Weizmann  and Sherif Feisal. On the 12th June General Claytonsent a long telegram  [No. P.  174] giving, the result of the  interview between Dr.Weizmann and Sherif Feisal.     Dr. Weizmann began by saying that the  most important of the duties with whichhe had been charged by the British Government was to get into  touch  with the arabs and to endeavour to bring about co-operation  with them.   Feisal  agreed  that  at thepresent time there was a necessity for this,  but said that as he  was only his fathersagent he was not in a position to express definite opinions on political questions.     Dr. Weizmann then said that it was not proposed to set up a Jewish Government;the Zionists wished to  colonise  and develop the country,  without  encroaching  on therights of others, working, if possible, under British guidance.   He pointed out that an arab kingdom would be supported by the Jews, and its development would be furtheredby the existence of a Jewish Palestine.     Feisal, in reply to this,  again emphasised  the  need of close  co-operation  bet-weenhis own people and the Jews, and personally accepted the possibility of Jewish claims toterritory in Palestine.   As, however, he did not represent  the Hejaz Government, hecould not publicly discuss these claims, which were already  the subject  of  much  enemy propaganda, of which he was not a little afraid;  any  open discussion  would now be misinterpreted  by  the  Bedouins, though it might profitably take place when Arabaffairs were more consolidated.     Feisal expressed his great satisfaction when Dr. Weizmann  told him that Zionistinfluence in America and elsewhere  would be used in favour of the Arab movement;and the interview ended with cordial expressions of mutual sympathy and  an invitation from Feisal for another meeting after Dr. Weizmann &apos;s return from America, whither hehad said be was shortly proceeding.
     Dr. Weizmann was much pleased with Feisafs attitude, and was very favourablyimpressed by his personality.  Colonel  Joyce, who was  present throughout the inter-view, thought  that  Feisal  really  considered  Jewish  co-operation essential  to  the fulfilment of Arab ambitions and personally welcomed it.  He thought, too, that Feisalwould probably  accept a Jewish Palestine (the possibility of which he appeared to fullyrealise)  if it furthered Arab expansion further north.     On the 14th June Mr. Balfour telegraphed  [No.  133] to General Clayton, instruct-ing him to convey to Dr. Weizmann his (Mr. Balfour&apos;s)  appreciation of his skill  andtact.                                    ARABIA.     Answer to  a Syrian  Memorial.   Mr. Balfour telegraphed  on  the  11th June[No. 75S] to  Sir  R.  Wingate the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to  a  memorialreceived from certain Syrians residing in Egypt :      His Majesty&apos;s Government has  considered the  memorial of the  seven  with thegreatest care.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government fully appreciates the  reasons  why  thememorialists desire  to  retain  their  anonymity,  and the  fact that  the memorial  isanonymous has not in any way detracted  from the  importance which His  jyiajesty&apos;sGovernment attributes to the document.     The areas mentioned in the memorandum fall into four  categories :      1.  Areas in Arabia which were free and independent before the outbreak of war.     2.  Areas  emancipated from Turkish control by the action of the Arabs themselves           during the present war.     3.  Areas  formerly under Ottoman  dominion,  occupied by the allied forces during           the present  war.     4,  Areas  still under Turkish control.     In  regard to the  first two categories, His Majesty&apos;s  Government recognises thecomplete and sovereign  independence of the Arabs inhabiting those areas and&apos; supportsthem in their  struggle for freedom.     In  regard to the areas  occupied - by the adlied forces,  His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Governmentdraws  the  attention of  the memorialists to  the texts of the proclamations  issuedrespectively by the general officers commanding  in  chief on  the taking  of Baghdad andJerusalem.   These  proclamations  embody the policy  of His  Majesty&apos;s  government towards the inhabitants of those regions.   It is the  wish and  desire of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the future government  of these  regions should be based, upon theprinciple of the consent of the governed, and this policy has and will continue to havethe support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     In  regard to the areas mentioned in the fourth category, it  is the wish and desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the oppressed  peoples of these  areas should obtain their freedom and independence,  and towards the achievement  of  this  object  HisMajesty&apos;s Government continues to labour.     His Majesty&apos;s Government  is fully  aware of, and  takes  into  consideration, thedifficulties  and  dangers which  beset  those  who work for the  regeneration  of the populations of the areas specified.     His Majesty&apos;s Government trusts  and believes that these obstacles can  and will be overcome, and wishes to give all support to those who desire to  overcome them.   It isprepared  to consider any scheme of  co-operation which is compatible with existingmilitary operations   and   consistent with the political principles  of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the allies.Asm.     Idrisi&apos;s Allowance. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to  Sir R.  Wingate on the 13th June[No. 761] informing  him that the terms of his telegram of the 4th  May [E.R. LX.VII,p. 5] must be adhered to ; the increased allowance would be paid as from the 1st May.                                     PERSIA.     The Cabinet-On  the  12th June, Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 532] that the shah had invited samsam--es-Sultaneh to form a new Cabinet, which showed that  the shah had  been influenced by those who were  in  favour of a  policy of inaction and of waiting to see how the  German offensive on the western front would end.  On the same
day, Sir C. Marling telegraphed again [No. 539] saying that  he had had an audience-with the Shah, who said that he had been anxious to appoint Vossugh-ed-Dowleh tothe premiership ;  he alleged reasons for not having acted in accordance with his wishes,but, in spite  of  them,  Sir C. Marling  was convinced that in reality he was awaiting the issue of events in France.     Telegraphing again on the  14th  June [No. 544] Sir C. Marling said that there wasa strong  feeling against samsam--es-Sultaneh in Teheran, but in spite  of that he had expressed confidence as to his ability to form a ministry.     It seemed certain that the  Shah must be coerced into accepting Vossugh-ed-Dowleh,whose  supporters were actually making  preparations for the exercise of the  necessarypressure.  But if he should win the day, there was no  doubt that the  Shah  would, inunderhand ways,  soon begin to  hamper him, and,  so long as he thought the germans were winning on the western front, would continue to do so.     Plot against the Shah. Sir 0. Marling telegraphed on the  12th  June  [No.  537]that he had been  informed (on good authority, but confidentially) that there  was a ploton foot for the deposition of the Shah, and that Shea-es-Sultaneh was one of  its leaders.Sir C. Marling did not know whether those concerned in the plot had adopted Shea-es-Sultaneh  as the   successor  to  the  throne ;  he  quite  thought   the  deposition  apossibility.     Telegraphing again on the 16th  [No. 551],  he transmitted a message from the consul  at Shiraz, who  said that the mullahs were preaching against [? the Kajar]dynasty.    Fars. On the 12th June,  Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 539] that the Shah had promised that  instructions should be given  for the sending of categorical   orders toSoulet to disperse his followers.    On the 11th June, according to a telegram sent by Sir C.  Marling on  the  15th[No. 548], the enemy, who were about  5 miles from  Shiraz,  had stopped the  watersupply and all trade.    Soulet Sultaneh, brother of SouIet-ed-Dowleh,  was then helping to keep mattersquiet at Abadeh, near which place  a former deputy-governor  had  appeared  with an armed force.    On the 12th June, Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 534] that Kawam had decided not to take pare in the  struggle unless Shiraz  should be  attacked  ; in  that casehe  would defend  it.    All  of  his  followers  had, at his  request,  sworn to supporthim.   The  consul  attributed  the  course adopted  by Kawam  to  the influence ofthe governor-general, and he hoped that from it an early betterment of the situation would result.    On the 16th July, Sir G Marling transmitted  [No. 551] a  communication from the consul at Shiraz, who &quot;said that so far Soulet and the Kashgais had not come  close, onlythe Kazerunis were fighting ; the latter  had that morning occupied the  gardens  roundabout the town, and would probably when night came  enter the town itself.    Tabriz. On  the 13th June/Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 541]  that  the alliedconsuls and subjects had left Tabriz on the 10th June.  He added that Mr.  Franssens,a Netherlands subject and  member of French Catholic mission, had  been   appointedSpanish consular agent by the Spanish Minister, and remained  to protect the interestsof the  allies.     The  Jangalis. Telegraphing on the 13th June [No. 543]  Sir C. Marling said thathe had been informed by General Dunsterville that General Bicharakoff was fighting the Jangalis, by whom the first shots had been fired.  The fighting was at  (?) Manjil.Telegraphing again on  the  1.7th  [No. 552] he said  that  many of the Jangalis hadthrown down  their arms, and, led by their German officers,  had taken  to flight ;  someof those who did not run away were  killed, and the rest surrendered.  Resht had been occupied  by General Bicharakoff on the  14th June, when the Jangalis  had  been againcompletely routed, many more prisoners  having been taken.     Meshed. Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on  the  16th June [No. 550] that  accordingto information received  on the  14th  from [? the consul-general  at] Meshed the politicalsituation at that place was quite satisfactory.  The governor-general had again asked that he should be informed of any opposition to us, and he had promised the dismissal of the  chief of the police,  who was unfriendly.       [898-100]                        &apos;                                 C
                                AFGHANISTAN.     Letter from the Amir. The Viceroy of India telegraphed on the 11th  June thathe had received a letter, most friendly in tone, from the Amir, in reply  to  his  own ofthe  IOth January.   The Amir said that he was  quite alive to the danger  of confusionspreading  to his country,  as  he was fully  aware  of the condition of Russia.  the moslem world  had  been profoundly moved by the  entry of Tux-key  into the war ;. theantidote was to be found in the conciliation of the Indian j people and  the strengthening of Afghanistan.  As to the latter, if the  British Government would supply him  withthe money and munitions he required, no foreign  enemy would ever reach India, throughAfghanistan ; his country must of course be protected  by his own people, the entry ofBritish troops could  never be tolerated.   He had been  asked for a frank expression ofhis views, and he had written in a light of&quot; seventeen years&apos; experience as a ruler, buthe recognised that he had  no right either to  recommend  the Indian people  to  theViceroy,  or to ask for arms and money  for  himself  The answer to  this  letter, theViceroy said, need not be hurried ;  it would require  careful  consideration.LA TEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                     RUSSIA.     Purging  the Soviet. The Russian  Government  issued  the  following  wireless message  on the 17th  June giving a decision of the  All-Russian Central Executive Committee taken  at its  session  on that  day: Considering,  (1.) that  the  Councifs authority is passing through an extremely difficult period, being attacked simultaneously by international imperialism on all fronts and  by its  coadjutors within the Russian Republic, who, in their conflict  with  the Government  of  the workmen  and  peasants, employ the most contemptible means,  including shameful  calumny,  conspiracy,  and revolt; (2) that the presence in the Councils organisations of representatives of parties which are  openly trying to discredit and  overthrow  the Councils  authority  is not tolerable;  and (3)  that from  documents  already  published and read at  the present session  it has  been clearly established  that  representatives  of the  Revolutionary Socialist party of the right and of the centre, and of the Mensheviks, including their most responsible members, have been found guilty  of  having organised armed  revolt against the workmen and peasants, in alliance with the  counter-revolutionaries on the Don  (in conjunction with Kaledin and Kornilov), in the Urals  (in  conjunction with Dutotf), in Siberia (in conjunction with Segov, Khorvat, and Kolrchak), and now,  within the  last  few  days,  with Czecho-Slovaks and  their   supporters, the  Black  Band; Considering all these facts, the  All-Russian Central Executive  Committee has decided to expel from its midst the representatives of the Revolutionary Socialist party  of the right and  of the centre, and of the Mensheviks, and proposes to  all the councils  of the workmen, soldiers, peasants, and Cossacks deputies to expel from their midst all  repre- sentatives of these factions.     German Propaganda. Mr.  Lockhart  telegraphed  on the  7th  June [No. 264,received 19th June]  that an agreement adopting a pro-German policy had been arrivedat a few days previously at a secret meeting of a group  of bankers, manufacturers, andnobles none of whom belonged to the Cadet party, the Cadets having refused to take part in  the meeting ; and  further, that  Prince  Gregory  Trubetskoi, M. Forshteter ofthe International Bank, Baron Nolde, and M. Tretiakoff had been appointed a committee with instructions to  approach Count Mirbach.  Mr. Lockhart also said that he had been informed  that  Dutoff was  receiving  financial  support from the Germans, who were trying  to  link  up  a combined movement of  Skoropadski,  the Don  Cossacks  under Krasnoff,  and the Ural Cossacks under Dutoff  himself.    The Germans, in  short, were financing  the counter-revolution almost openly.                                    PERSIA.     Tabriz.-Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 558] on the 17th  June that the Turks at Tabriz,  disregarding the Spanish flag  and the protests  made by the  Spanish  consular agent on behalf of the allied interests under his protection, had taken  possession  of the American hospital and the British consulate.  He had  been  informed of this by the Spanish Minister.
     Fars. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 17th June [No. 559A] that the Kashgaisand  Kazerunis had been driven out of Chinar Rahda (? r) by a column of Indian troopswith a flank guard of South Persian Rifles.  Our casualties were 29,  four  being  killed :those of the. enemy were estimated  at 400, of whom 150 were killed.APPENDIX.          Report on Shatrah, by Major Dickson, Political Officer at Nasiriyah.     1. I received sanction from G.H.Q. to proceed to Shatrah on the evening  of the 7th March.  On the  morning  of  the 8th  at  10 A.M.  I  left  Nasiriyah  for Suwaij, accompanied by an escort of sixty Muntifik Guards (the local Political Levy Corps) and two Arab officers, together  with ten shaykhs and an Arab assistant.     After five hours&apos; march we reached Suwaij, being caught in a thunderstorm 3 miles short of that place.&apos;     The  distance  from Nasiriyah to Suwaij I made  to be 30 miles calculating my pace at 6 miles per hour, trotting and walking.     At Suwaij we spent the night as guests of Haji Saqban, the principal man  of the town,  a  merchant  of  Kurd origin.  His son Hassun is  a frequent visitor  to Nasiriyah. Haji Saqban is the obvious man to appoint Mudir of the place.     Haji Saqban gave  us  a royal welcome,  and insisted  on providing dinner, bed. and breakfast for  myself, the shaykhs, and the  mounted  escort.  We left Suwaij  on the morning of the 9th and at  walking pace reached Shatrah at 11  A.M. distance 10 miles. From Suwaij to Shatrah I was accompanied  by all the shaykhs of the khabajah some fifteen of them : each of whom came with a large mounted, escort.  On reaching Abudah territory  I was similarly met  by the  &apos;Abudah shaykhs,  including Khaiyun-al-&apos;Ubaid. I  was much struck by the number and  importance of  these  shaykhs, and the large number of towers possessed by these tribes.  I counted  close on 300 towers in ivhafajah territory  alone.     At  Shatrah I proceeded  to  the  Rais-al-Balidiyah&apos;s house, where Khaiyun  enter- tained me to  a banquet.   Afterwards I proceeded to the Sarai, where I received the surrounding shaykh and notables of the town.  I lived  in Mizhir Pasha&apos;s  old  house a fine building  equal to anything existing  in Nasiriyah.  The floors of this house are curiously enough tiled with large bricks brought from Tali Lo, the ruined site about 10 miles north-east of Shatrah.  These  bricks all bear clear inscriptions of the usual type, and are in excellent preservation.  As this house was obviously the best bouse in the place, I ordered Khaiyun to retain it for myself or any other British officer.   It will be the future assistant political officers residence.     I  spent the 10th  in Shatrah, receiving  people, discussing  the Bad&apos;ah problem, and generally making  myself familiar with  the town and its wants.  On  the 11th  I proceeded to  the Bad&apos;ah, where it  takes  off from the Gharraf, and proceeded a short distance north  to Tall  Lo.  This ruin is about ^ mile in extent and square.   On the 12th I  held  a  final  Durbar of &apos;Abudah,  khabajah,  Bani Zaid, Albu Sa&apos;ad, Qaraghol, Bani Richab, Bani Sa&apos;id and Humaid shaykhs, and left  Shatrah for a trip down the Bad&apos;ah.     Before leaving I  had  a private talk with Khaiyun.  I informed him he was to consider himself the Government representative in Shatrah till  such time as an assistant political officer should be appointed.  I  told him his salary  would be  500 rupees  commencing from 1st  March, 1918, and that he was to enrol  thirty horsemen at once with an  Arab  officer  of his choosing.  These  horsemen are to work in Shatrah and Nasiriyah alternatively, being  relieved every fifteen days.   They will be incorporated in  the Muntifik Arab Guards.  Until the thirty  horsemen were ready I decided to leave thirty men of &quot; B &quot; squadron Muntifik  Guards  under Yasir Yuzbashi in Shatrah.     These men are now comfortably installed in  the Shatrah Sarai barracks, which are in very fair condition.   My orders to Yasir are to support Khaiyun in keeping law and order in the town, and generally to so act as to be a credit to the corps.     Khaiyun   expressed great pleasure  at seeing me,  and   my giving  him a  definitejob of  work in Shatrah  has pleased him very much.   I told  Khaiyun   I  would visit Shatrah every fortnight to see how things were running.     On my second visit I hope to institute a Balacliyab, and draw up a simple scheme of municipal sanitation which Shatrah badly wants.  Khaiyun is very keen to get the city clean, and  a body  of sweepers instituted. This  can only be done if  we raise the
 necessary funds.  This I hope in a small way to do by a house-tax.   It is, of course, necessary to go very slow at first,  so too  much in  the way of municipal government need hot be expected for some time.      At Shatrah I was joined&apos;by Haji Hasan Hamdani, Shaykh Naji. of the Mutairat, and Haji Salih-al-Karadi, three prominent Suq  notables ; these,  by previous arraoge- ment with the assistant political officer at Snq, with twenty Suq horsemen were to work up the Bad&apos;ah river from the direction of  the  Hammar, and so show themselves in Albu Salih country, and  make the process  of peaceful penetration appear more real. Their trip was entirely successful.      I left Shatrah for the Bani  Zaid and Albu  Sa.&apos;ad country, being accompanied through each  tribe by the shaykh of those  places.   The  Bani Zaid  appear very pros- prosperous, having a plentiful water supply.   The Albu Sa&apos;ad, on the contrary,, are in a bad way, and their country, which is marked on some maps as marsh, is now^quire dry and desert, like that of the Azairij.  I scaled several towers in Albu Sa&apos;ad country, and got a very good idea of the Bad&apos;ah generally.      As  regards the prosperity  of the  tribes  round Shatrah, the &apos;Abudah  may be considered  as particularly rich ;  their wheat and  barley areas  are  splendid, and the. areas not under cultivation consist of wonderful meadow lands teeming with sheep and cattle.   The Bani  Zaid are just as prosperous as the &apos;Abudah,  so are the  Bani to add. section, which live on the Bad&apos;ah.   Those chiefly hard hit by the diminution of water in the Bad&apos;ah are  the Albu Sa&apos;ad,  the khabajah,  and, nearer home, the Hassunah district and Ibrahim Azairij.      At midday I halted for coffee at the village of the shaykh of the  Albu Sa&apos;ad, and continuing my journey in  the afternoon reached  the eastern end of  the  Hassunah. territory, where Abdullah-ibn-Falih-al-Sa&apos;dun  was camped.   I spent the  night..with  &apos;Abdul!ah, and the reception he gave was  all that one  could want.   His camp  was charmingly situated in the  middle of miles of grassland close to the  overflow of the. Bad&apos;ah,   J  calculated I had ridden 40 miles south-east of Shatrah.  Next  morning  I rode into Nasiriyah, taking seven hours over the trip.  The  distance I made to be about 35 . miles.  Salih-al-Daghir,  our  nominee of the  Al  Ibrahim tribe which lies west of Hassunah, has been  making himself unpleasant,  according to local report.  He, I found, had without permission adopted the title of Mudir-al-Azairij and Hassunah, causing much offence all round and natural indignation amongst the Azairij.      The  Hassunah district is remarkable for the countless  old disused water-channels that cross it in a west to east direction.   There appear to be myriads of them, showing the extraordinary  amount of wasted labour that  has been put  into  this area.  I calculate the Hassunah to be  about  ] 5 miles square.   It is  now quite deserted, though its former prosperity  must  have been great indeed.  Local Arabs say that it has died only in last fifteen years and for the  same reason as the Azairij and khabajah have died, it being watered by.the old Gharraf or Shatrah river which  has dried up.  As it is, the Hassunah is a fairly thickly wooded (camel thorn)  district with  plenty of tall grass at this season.   Hence  it has many Arab encampments all over it.  These appeared to be mostly khabajah (migratory sections), and all were  very hospitable.  On every occasion as we rode past a camp the women would come out and offer us bowls of robah,. libin, and camefs. milk, a  custom, I was told, common among all Muntifik Arabs during the spring.   Any  suggestion of payment is at onCe rejected as ah insult.      2. Political Situation of Abudah khabajah and Bani Zaid and  their Connections. with Shatrah. Shatrah  you may liken  to  a.  bone  in. the centre of a lot of crows represented by  the  various sections of the  &apos;Abudah.   The crows all want to seize the* bone, but dare not, each fearing his  neighbours, who certainly would combine against the one  who  attempted  such . an operation.   Khaiyun, the  boldest  crow,  has his stronghold  close  to  the  town, and though  he dare not  exactly seize the bone, be cunningly contrives to act as the tOwn&apos;s protector from the other crows.  The result is . that he. is looked upon wiih favour by the townsfolk, who vie  with.each other in making him presents  of money, grain, and merchandise.   Khaiyun  is thus  their  insurance policy.   This attitude of Khaiyun has  made him hated  by  all the :Abudah ; they dare. not attack him,  however, as Khaiyun  has two strong  allies in the khabajah and the Bani Zaid, both lying to the south and east of the  Al Jahland Al Awwad respectively, whose shaykhs are very hostile to Khaiyun, and form  the strongest likely combination , against him.                                          :      It  is  a&apos; question of keeping the balance of power, and for ail. the evil things that may be  said  of Khaiyun, he  certainly manages his affairs with, masterly  skill  and ability.   A curious point in the situation is that should the &apos;Abudah go to war or be
threatened by war Khaiyun automatically assumes the leadership,  no one disputing his right.    Khaiyun&apos;s alliance with the khabajah and  hankey Zaid makes the question of closingthe Bad&apos;ah a most delicate one for him,   The khabajah  are dying lor the  Bad&apos;ah&apos; to  be closed, the, Bani Zaid on the contrary are as  vehemently opposed to  any such  idea.Khaiyun cannot afford to lose either of these strong supporters of his.   It is intresting to study  the middle course he takes  in consequence.   He supports or goes against thescheme in accordance with the nature of his audience.    3. Question of Closing the Bad&apos;ah. This  cannot  be  done  this year  for thefollowing reasons :     (1.)  The  Bad&apos;ah where it takes off from  the Gharraf is now a swift deep  river a           hundred yards broad and thirty feet deep.    (2.)  The  Gharraf may be expected to rise steadily from now onwards, and to close           it in face of the  coming flood would be too big an undertaking.    (3.)  If great  efforts were made  and. it were closed now,  at least  thirty-five days           would  be required for the operation.  This would  make it much too late  for           the crops to benefit.    (4.)  The tribal situation round Shatrah is too delicate to allow of the  bund being           made straight away.  One must   go slow &quot; for the present.    I admit that surveying the matter from  Nasiriyah  I  did  not see much difficulty inthe operation, but I have changed my opinion.  The  political situation is the onewhich will give us most trouble.   The Bad&apos;ah tribes are hot  against the  scheme; they,consist of the Bani Zaid, the Bani  Said, the &apos;Abudah-al-&apos;Arab, the &apos;Awwad section ofthe Abudah, the Albu Salih, and all have so strong an interest in the matter that theycannot be ignored.   It is obvious on the other  hand that something must be done  forShatrah  town, the khabajah, the Azairij, the  Albu Sa&apos;ad, and lower down the Al Ibrahim,and the  Bani  Zaid of Bachah.  The territory occupied  by these tribes is wonderfullyfertile, and covers some 700 to 1,000 square miles of likely wheat and barley land.  Thenagain the prosperity of  Shatrah town depends most certainly on its having.a river.  Atthe rate  of silting up that is  going on I calculate that in four  years, unless somethingis done,  Shatrah will have no flow of water at all past it.   It  will  become like  Zubair.It is far too big and important a  town to deserve such a fate.   As it is, after seeing the bad&apos;ah I should say that 90 per cent, of the Gharraf water goes down the Bad&apos;ah and10 per cent, of the water towards Shatrah.  This 10 per cent,  is all taken  off by sidechannels before it  reaches Suwaij,  10 miles south of  Shatrah.  Not only is it all  takenoff in this way, but being very heavily laden with silt, it is depositing sediment at therate of 2 feet annually  in  the bed of the Shatrah river.   This process  forms a mostinteresting study, and I can now see what it  was that killed  the great ancient canalsystems  of the Jesira which took their water from the Tigris.   They have simply siltedup, and  the great  cities on  them have died  away, just Avhat the  Arab  tells you willhappen  to Shatrah if something  is  not   done.  My opinion after  having seen  theproblem with my  own eyes  is that three things  must go hand in hand if Shatrah is tohave  its  river again as formerly, these are :      (1.)  The entrance  to  the Gharraf opposite  Kut must be systematically deepened            by dredging on a large scale.     (2.)  The Shatrah river must  be dredged  out from its mouth as far as Hamza,  a            point  6 miles south of Suwaij.     (3.) The Badaa must be then  closed,  leaving, a bye-pass for the tribes drinking            water from it.     4. Town of Shatrah. A very handsome town with broad streets, built much  in.thesame  style as Nasiriyah.   It has a splendid  river frontage, the  houses  built  being jwell back off the river (a distance of 50 yards), which makes  one think that the originalbuilders of the town intended it to have a broad promenade  along the river frontage,both for the use of the townspeople and  for landing stages.   The houses are large and well built, especially those  facing the river,  and more especially still those occupied byMizhir Pasha and the family of Ahmad Beg, formerly a turkish official, which are betterthan anything seen in Nasiriyah.  It has a population of about 10,000.     The population is mostly Shi&apos;ah, though there are about  500  Sunnis in the place ; these have a  fine mosque and a  school, attended by 120 children.   A few Jews eke out a precarious livelihood, as  do also a few Sabians.   There would  appear to  be  many
1Vfamilies closely  connected with  Suq-al-Shuyukh, the  Hamdani  and  Dabus families;having strong connections in the town.     The bazaars form  the chief features of  the town.  There are  seven  large  ones,covered in, well  built, and better than anything  I  have yet  seen  south of Baghdad.Two of them are the property of and were built by Khawajah Nahnm Sarkis.     There are also about  420 shops, about 100 of which are closed down owing to bad:trade, caused by our blockade arrangements in. Nasiriyah and Suq.     A fine sarai of the usual type faces the river, in which were the  Turkish municipaloffices, telegraph and civil offices ; also headquarters of the Shatrah  Qadha.  Upstairsthe sarai is in good condition, except for the central reception room.   Downstairs  itconsists of stables in fair repair.     A barracks for regular troops existed in Turkish times, capable of holding a battalion of infantry ;  this was situated on the north  side of the  town.  These barracks  havebeen completely gutted by the Arabs, who have stolen everything,  including most ofthe bricks.   Curiously enough, this is the only damage done by the populace to govern-ment buildings.     Close to the barracks is Salman-al-Jasinfs house and date  garden.   This evidentlywas a very fine building, but  it is in ruins, having been burnt down by Khaiyun lastyear,  when he drove out the Albu Shamki  section from Shatrah.  To the north ofShatrah lies the large settlement of the Albu Shamki, also deserted and in ruins for thesame  reason.  Curiously enough, the heads of the  Albu Shamki were the only people who failed to come and  see me, whether from fear of Khaiyun  or not I do not know.  I did not think it  politic to  ask too much on my first visit.    There is a large grain go-down, some 100  yards square  ; it appeared  to be  wellstocked with most forms of grain, the prices of which were, generally speaking, lower than those of Nasiriyah, though wheat was. very scarce.    Trade appeared to be at a standstill.   One of the first things I  was asked for bythe merchants was that more goods should be allowed out from  Nasiriyah.   This, ifsanctioned, would be a wise measure, and I shall ask the deputy civil commissioner, atthe earliest opportunity, to allow me to increase the Shatrah allowance in the form of a permit to  Suq merchants to export certain goods there.  The Suq merchants have long been complaining that they do not get a fair chance in this respect.   The present  is  agood opportunity to help them.    Six large balams were unloading grain at  Shatrah, and I saw a considerable numbersailing down the Bad&apos;ah.  Balams wanting to  avoid being caught  by I.W.T. obviouslymake their headquarters at Shatrah  and ply their trade up and down the Gharraf andBad&apos;ah.  There  is plenty  of scope for them to  do a good business.    My visit caused a great  stir, of course.  Most of the  people had never seen anEnglishman,  and turned out by the  hundreds  to follow7 me through  the streets.   Thegeneral feeling appeared to be friendly.   All appeared anxious to have  a British officerliving in the place.   The people, however, seemed to be vaguely uneasy and frightened,which I put down to Khaiyun&apos;s ride.    Khaiyun is  a curious  study.  His past character we know bad is not the word for it.  He does not talk much, and when he does he is brutally frank.   No.one, tribesmanor townsman, has a good word to say for him.   Cruel to a degree, he manages to  hidethis trait by  a bluff and hearty manner.   He is an enigma, but at the same time he  is our one hope.  He is the  strong man of to-day, and can be expected to keep the Abudahand Shatrah Qadha generally in order.     Conclusion. I am  greatly in favour of a light railway being run from Nasiriyah toShatrah.   With this completed, the  question of governing Shatrah Qadha would be the simplest  of matters, instead  of, as  now, an awkward problem.  An assistant political officer could easily reside in the place with only an  Arab  guard, but   the want of amilitary guard to support him would soon make itself felt, especially  if the  assistantpolitical officer wanted to  do anything against Khaiyun&apos;s interest.
