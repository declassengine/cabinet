APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN REPORT  No.  XCIX.                                        EGYPT.       ALTHOUGH there are no further telegrams regarding the situation in Egypt in  this  weeks Report, it is considered desirable that the telegrams inserted in last week&apos;s  should receive comment.       Egypt has been governed since the proclamation of the British protectorate in 1917  by martial law.   During the past four years it speaks well for the British administration  of martial law that the progress and prosperity of Egypt has steadily advanced, and that  the immense majority of the population has been, at least outwardly, loyal and content..  With  the  cessation of hostilities  a  new chapter  opens  in the  history of Egypt..  Egyptians are beginning to wonder  what form of government  is to follow martial law,  and  in  what directions political progress  will  follow the  educational and  economic  progress that have been the remarkable features of the last few years.   The Sultan and  ministers like Rushdi  Pasha and Adly Pasha are, like the bulk of the population, loyal&apos;  to the  British  protectorate, and  desire  our  guidance and assistance in the  further  development of Egypt in political and social as well as economic spheres.       A man like Saad Zaglul  is a hidebound reactionary of the worst type.   He and  his kind regret the Turkish clays when the rich pashas (he is one himself) could exploit  the  peasantry, and by indulging  in  every  form  of intrigue and corruption  acquire  decorations and political power.  Saad Zaglul is an old opponent of the British, more  particularly of  the late Lord Kitchener.   He  belongs to the type of Egyptian who  thinks it is a  fine and brave thing to show zeal for his country a concept which with  him  and his class is a means to an end and not an  end by making rude remarks  in  Arabic  or  Levantine  French  about British  officers who  are his  fellow guests  in  or  members of the Mohammed Ali Club in Cairo. .  Hitherto  Saad Zaglul  and his  class  have had one  genuine  political principle, i.e., sympathy with the Turk and Turkish  methods of government.  They have always been ready to exploit religious fanaticism  or economic  discontent (of  the  latter  being often the  main cause) to bolster  up&apos;  pro-Turkish aims.       Now that the Turk has been handsomely beaten, and  there seems a  good chance  that the peace terms will be such as  will make  it  clear to all Turks that they  were  handsomely beaten, Saad Zaglul and his friends will  have  to revise their speeches and  their methods; but their end will remain the same, viz., more power and more money  for the pasha class.       It  would  be   a  grave  mistake  to identify   Saad   Zaglul.  and  the  so-called  &quot;Nationalists&quot; with  the  Sultan or with ministers  like   Rushdi.   The latter is  an  able  man of wide experience,  and it is hoped  that his resignation  will be  withdrawn,  and that he and his colleagues may  soon be heard on the many difficult problems wdiich  will shortly face the Egyptian Government.   The British Foreign Office  is responsible  through Parliament to  the people of this  country for the good government of the  British protectorate of Egypt, and the same sympathy which has been shown towards  political reforms in India is not likely to be withheld from  Egypt.  Egypt has  already         [898-126]
a native ministry which forms with the Sultan and one British official the  financial adviser the  Egyptian  cabinet.  Egypt has  already  a popularly  elected  legislativeassembly, and the provincial  governments (mudirias) are native in character undernative mudirs.  However, there is certainly a legitimate  demand for greater freedomof political  discussion after  four years of press  censorship, and a desire for  greateropportunity for public and responsible criticism of all departments of the administration,both European and native.   Further, now that the capitulations are abolished, a largenumber of Levantive persons who formerly enjoyed foreign protection will be anxiousto take their share as  Egyptians in moulding the destiny of their adopted country.There is a yearly increase in the number of educated natives and a consequent increasein the  number of &quot;politicians&quot; or aspirants  for  government  employment.   On such questions responsible Egyptian opinion has a right to be heard, and will be  heard, butit must be  borne in mind  that there is  nothing like the same sense of collective responsibility, or the same  standard of ideals in public life, or the same proportion ofeducated persons in  Egypt  that  there is in  European  countries.   The bulk of thepeople of Egypt are still  illiterate and  still live in the same physical  and social conditions in mud villages as their forefathers lived sixty centuries ago.   In no countryis the task of the really genuine reformer harder, or are the schemes of the reactionarydisguised as a reformer more  skilfully laid and more difficult to  counter.

On the 12th December Mr. Lindiey reported[No. 513] that as recent events in Siberia had produced a certain effervescence in Arch-angel,  General Ironside had agreed to publish the following notice : The allied military command, after consultation with the allied embassies and in view of rumours circulatingin the  town, considers it desirable  to announce that, while carefully adhering to theprinciple of  non-interference in Russian internal politics, it will insist on the mainten-ance of public order within the area protected  by the allied  troops and the limitation  ofpolitical activity in this region to strictly legal  proceedings.  No  coup d^etat or otherviolent or  illegal political change favouring either Right or Left will be permitted  totake place.     Troubles with  the Troops. Mr.  Lindiey reported  on the 11th December [No. 508]that there had been trouble with the troops. That morning the 1st Archangel regimenthad  refused  to parade,  one company having already refused to  proceed to the front.Later, in accordance with the orders of General Marushevski, 500 out of the 1,800 menin the regiment came out:  the rest refused  to do so, and some shots were fired from thewindows.   Fire was returned from machine-guns and, this proving  ineffectual,  a coupleof bombs were  thrown  in the barracks, which  induced  all  to  surrender.   GeneralMarushevski then ordered the leaders to be  given up, threatening, in case of refusal,  todecimate the regiment: twenty-five men were denounced.UKRAINA.     Coup d&apos;Etat. Reuters Amsterdam  agent reported on the 16th December that aKieff telegram via Berlin stated that the  town had been occupied on the 14th Decemberby the troops of the &quot; directory,&quot; which was  composed of Messrs. Vinitchenko, Petlyura,Schwetz, and Reivsky.   The hetman had  abdicated, and  the cabinet had  resigned.Complete calm prevailed  in the town, in which order was being maintained by german troops and those of the directory.
SIBERIA.     Japanese Policy. Sir Conynghame Greene telegraphing from Tokio  on the 10thDecember [No. 1216] reported that on the provious day the director of intelligence had spoken to the military attache as follows :      The main object of Japan&apos;s policy in Siberia, as I understand it, is the  establish-ment of peace and order as soon as possible, and for this purpose I do not think thatthe organisation of a central Government is as yet either desirable or possible.  ProvisionalGovernments should first be established in different districts by the Russians themselves and  should be sustained by (? Russian troops).  The far eastern district would comprisethe  Ussuri, Saghalin,  Okhotsk, and  Amur provinces, and might be administered byHorvat,  with Semenoff commanding all the present Cossack bodies, which  would beunified under him.  It is for this purpose that they are  being kept in being by Japan.     All  this  must be done in co-operation with the Omsk  Government, without theconcurrence of which it would hardly be possible.    Eventually, when peace and orderhave been restored locally, the different sub-divisions would be brought under a singleGovernment.     Japan has recently been criticised under the following headings :      1. That the size of her expeditionary force is excessive.     2. That she has sent no troops further west than Lake Baikal.     3. That she has made no effort to send  to  the  Ural front the Cossack bands that          she is supporting.     Taking which in  order :                           1     1. It is no larger than  is  necessary for the maintenance of order and the safety of the railway.   If reduced,  there  would  be  an immediate recurrence of  Bolshevikactivities.     2. For this there has  hitherto been no invitation from any of the  allies, and it  is in accord with the agreement made with the United States.     3. Not one of  Cossack bands is sufficiently trained to be worth sending, and themajority  of them would probably decline to go.     On the 15th  December Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 341] a message from the highcommissioner to the effect that the first part of the above statement represented thepolicy followed in Siberia by Japanese officers, and was in accordance with what GeneralNakajima had said to him.     On the same day Mr. Alston also transmitted  [No. 342] a message from GeneralKnox, who said that the chief  reason for the refusal of the Cossacks  to go  to the frontwas the fact that they were subsidized by Japan for remaining in the  East.     Semenoff and the Japanese. On the 17th December Mr. Alston  telegraphed[No.  347] a translation of a copy of  the telegram which was sent to  Semenoff fromTokio on the 22nd November,  instructing  him to protest against Admiral Kolchak.This telegram was signed &quot;Kato.&quot;  In another telegram  [No. 349] sent on the same day  Mr.  Alston reported that  he had  been  informed by  the  Japanese agent thata  message  warning  him, in forcible terms,  to  behave  himself had been sent toSemenoff.     Semenoff and the Bolsheviks. On the 17th  December Mr. Alston  transmitted[No.  346] a message dated the 15th December from the consul  at Irkutsk reporting that  Semenoff had appeared  at  a  trial  of  125  Bolsheviks  and granted them an amnesty.   The authority for this was a telegram from Chita received by the Russianstaff.THE CAUCASUS.     Alleged Armenian Attack onMoslems. Sir Percy Cox reported on the 18th December[No. 1054] that news had been received of a serious attack  made  by Armenians onthe  Moslems of Nakchiwan.   Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  said  that the Persians of Khoi,Maku, &amp;c, when they heard the news, would certainly go to the assistance of theircompatriots at  Nakchiwan,  a  large  community.  Serious bloodshed would thereforeensue unless immediate action were taken;  he had  been  asked by the neighbouringPersian  authorities  for  permission to send a  small body of troops to  Nakchiwan.;Sir Percy Cox pointed out the importance of doing  nothing which would  suggest the
idea that Persia was desirous of rectifying her frontier, and  asked the prime minister-to take no steps till he, Sir  Percy, had ascertained whether it were possible for theBritish military authorities at  Batum [? Baku] to take action.                                    RUMANIA.     New Cabinet. On the 17th  December Lord Derby transmitted [No.  1797] a message from the  allied ministers in Bucharest, who reported that  M. Bratiano had formed a new Government in which he would be president of the council  and foreign minister.     The Jews. In  a telegram dated the 12th  December [No. 531 A]  Sir George Barclay, after recalling that in a recent joint message the allied ministers had mentioned the strong animosity prevailing against the Jews, reported that they were profuse in their manifestations in favour of the Entente now that the  Germans had been defeated, though throughout the war they had been pro-German.     Sir George Barclay added that he and  the  French minister had  repeatedly called the attention of the  Rumanian Government to the necessity for taking  precautions against pogroms.                                   BULGARIA.     Serbian Claims. Sir Horace Rumbold reported on the 13th December [No. 2468] that the new Serbian minister had stated in conversation that, so far  as Bulgaria itself went, Serbia would only claim a strip of territory to secure the railway along the Timok river.   In regard, however, to Macedonia, she would claim  the part formerly occupied by the  Bulgarians; the Slav districts of Macedonia  were, he  said,  more  Serb than Bulgarian.   Such  a solution might, the Serbian minister thought, ultimately induce Bulgaria to  enter the  Jugo-Slav state.                                    TURKEY.     French Activities. -Admiral Webb reported on the 11th December [No. 148] that he had  received a  visit from an  officer  on  the  staff of the French admiral, who had made a proposal in  regard to the  police and gendarmerie.  Admiral  Webb gathered from him that, with the concurrence apparently of the grand vizier,  the  French had placed themselves  in  touch with  the gendarmerie department, for  the  purpose, he understood,  of exercising an indirect influence now, with a view to its  becoming direct later on, over the gendarmerie, and  possibly not  over the gendarmerie only, but also over other departments.     The proposal was  that we should co-Operate with the French in  ascertaining the general state of the police and gendarmerie, with a view to the  present maintenance of public security, and the ascertaining of the probable  nature  and composition of the gendarmerie after peace.  To this he had replied that his instructions precluded  him&apos; from interfering in any matters other than those concerning the  armistice, adding that interference in  other  matters might  bring  about a state of affairs  which  would  be contrary to the intentions of the Entente.   He asked for further instructions as to the extent with  which he  was to associate himself with French activities.     The Capitulations. -Admiral Webb telegraphed on the 11th December [No. 158] asking for  instructions in viewr of the  fact that the French  Government  had  sent orders  to its  high commissioner to  obtain  forthwith   the  re-establishment of the capitulations.    Ex-Ministers  and Officials in Germany. Sir Horace  Rumbold  reported on the 13th December  [No.   2473]  that he had received information  to the  effect that the Turkish Government had demanded of the  German that former ministers  and officials should not be allowed  a refuge  in Germany, and that  the  latter  Government  had promised  to put  all  of them, except  Enver  and Talaat, under provisional arrest.Nothing, however, had been done.   The German  Government had maintained that thelarge sum of money which Talaat had  brought with him  had not been stolen : it  was intended for political purposes.   It  also denied that  Enver  and Talaat had  instigatedthe massacres.,,,., .   Conditions  in Constantinople.- Admiral Webb telegraphed  on the  13th  June[No. 173] that before long some action must  be taken to avoid a famine : if something       [898-126]                                                       B 2
were not done the situation would probably cause us serious trouble.  According to  allreports the stocks in the town were nearing depletion.      .      .    Telegraphing again  on  the  following day  [No.  183] he said that the  internal  /condition of Constantinople  was  continually growing worse ; robberies and  murderswere daily becoming more frequent.  If, he said, as seemed to be the case, the  turkish authorities were unable to maintain order, the only remedy would  be  for the  allies to police  the town ; it was practically impossible for them to  allow  a continuance of thepresent state of things, which would be very harmful to their prestige.                                NORTH AFRICA.    Italian   Claims. Mr.   Balfour   informed   Sir  Reginald  Wingate   on  the13th December [No.  1518] that a memorandum setting  out its claims in  Africa andArabia had been presented  by the Italian  Government.   That Government  claimedBritish and French Somaliland,  Jubaland, a  readjustment of the Cyrenaica-Egyptianfrontier, the whole of Abyssinia as a sphere of influence, and certain  concessions from france on the western frontier of Tripoli; it further  claims that  the Farsan  Islandsshould be occupied by Italy, and that  no  Power should  occupy Arabia, in  whichcommerce and  commercial penetration  should be free.  The claims were, Mr. Balfoursaid, made with the object of giving effect to  the  promise  of territorial readjustmentswhich  Italy received when she entered the war.                                     SYRIA.    Prince  FeisaVs Mission. On the 12th December Sir Mark Sykes telegraphed[No. 37] that great hopes were pinned  upon  Prince Feisafs  mission, and should thesebe disappointed he foresaw the conversion of the existing real patriotic enthusiasm intothe most extreme fanatical anarchy, of which  he was convinced the Turks would take full advantage.    Visit of General  Allenby to llama and Aleppo. On the 12th December Sir MarkSykes  reported  that  General   Allenby had  visited  Hama  and  Aleppo  on  the10th December, and had been enthusiastically received in  both places.                                    ARABIA.    Ibn Saud  and  the  Ikhwan [E.R.  XCVIII,  p. 6]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed toSir Reginald Wingate  on the 15th December [No. 1524 1 instructing  him to discuss with Mr. Philby, who  was expected to reach Egypt  within the  next few days, thequestion of the desirability of informing  Ibn Saud plainly  that if he did  not at onceabandon all aggressive action against Hejaz not only would his subsidy be stopped, butalso His Majesty&apos;s Government  would  consider  itself  at liberty to take such measures as  might be proper for the maintenance of peace.  Should Sir Reginald Wingatedecide to send this  message lie should  arrange for Colonel Wilson to  deliver itpersonally, as  the India Office  thought  that, were  this done,  a greater  impressionwould  be made on Ibn Saud.   Colonel Wilson, too, would  be able  to form a first-handopinion on the  matter.    In reply,  Sir Reginald  Wingate  telegraphed on  the 17th  December  [No. 1894]saying that he  was very strongly of  opinion that the warning  to Ibn  Saud should  besent in a letter from the chief  political officer at Baghdad,  through whom Tip to thepresent communications from the British Government  had  been conveyed  to him.He, Sir Reginald Wingate, also said that, having regard to the religious  excitementamong the Wahabites, and the animosity  between the King of Hejaz and  ibn  Saud,he should deprecate any British  officer being sent to Nejd at present.    Medina. On the 14th December Mr. Balfour instructed [No.  136] Admiral Webbto inform the Turkish  Government  that  the Dardanelles forts would be destroyed ifMedina had not surrendered  by  the  following day.  This was repeated [No. 1526] toSir Reginald Wingate, who was instructed to have  Fakhri informed that he would beheld personally responsible for failure to carry out his obligations under the  armistice.     On the 16th December Admiral Webb reported [No.  189] that he had informed the Turkish Government that the Dardanelles forts would be  destroyed  if Medina  wasnot surrendered immediately on the  receipt of the  special  instructions which had been.sent to Fakhri.                                                             *   ; JI
     On the 16th December Sir Reginald Wingate reported [No. 1892] that the Turkishenvoy had not been able to leave Yembo till 9 P.M. on  the  previous  day.   The  com-manders of the Arab forces had been advised not to resume hostilities till Fakhri had had sufficient time to receive his instructions, even after the technical expiration of thearmistice.   Hostilities would be resumed should  he fail to comply absolutely with these instructions.ADEN.     Lahej. On  the 11th December  Sir Reginald Wingate reported that Said Pashahad surrendered on the previons day, and had arrived  in Aden, with  his staff.   Lahejhad, Sir Reginald added, been occupied without  incident.                                     PERSIA.     Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  and the Shah [E.R. XCVTII, p. 6j. Sir Percy Cox reported on the 12th. December [No.  1042] that, on  the  8th, the prime minister  had had the promised audience with the Shah, the result of which had been a temporary reconciliation :the  Shah, however, had insisted on the  withdrawal  of Yossugh&apos;s brother  from thegovernorship of Meshed.   Amicable relations with his Majesty could only be maintained by ignoring his ignorance or neglect of the constitutional principles on which the cabinet must work, and by accepting the nomination of undesirable persons to important  posts and so bringing the cabinet into conflict with public opinion.   Sir Percy added that, inhis opinion, should the cabinet have an acute rupture with the Shah and in consequenceresign, it  would  have the sympathy  of the  greater  part of the public, and, as  very general contempt was felt for his  Majesty, things might go  hard with him.    Fire  in the Ministry of Finance. In a telegram of the  8th  December [No.  1034]Sir Percy  Cox reported that, on the 6th, the offices of the ministry of finance had  beenburnt out and the greater part of the records destroyed.   The  prime minister had, bymeans of an inspired article, attributed the occurrence  to opposition  intrigue.   He wasthe first in the field, but doubtless there would be a counter-attack.
