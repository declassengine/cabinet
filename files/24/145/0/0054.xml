Bolshevik Repudiation of Charge of  ill-treating Prisoners of  War. -In a wire-less  message  sent  out by M. Chicherin, the following passage  occurs :  We repudiateindignantly the allegation of  the British  prisoners in  Russia  being ill-treated.  MajorGoldsmith and his companions are  kept in confinement only so long as M. Ruskolnikoffand  the other arrested Russians are in  the same condition.  The mass of the Britk-hprisoners of war live in Moscow in  very good conditions and are treated like friends.     A Bolshevik Message. -The following message was sent  out through the wireless stations of the Russian Government  on the 27th March :      The negative task of crushing  the  bourgeoisie is almost solved.   We  have now before us the positive task of creating a new  communist society out of the fragments ofthe old society.     We  now stand before  a decisive  issue.  The animated discussions which thissubject brought about in the party meetings  showed the solidarity of all the members in regard to questions of  principle, and the aspiration of all  to proceed with  the workof practical construction ;  but the debates also showed that some comrades still favouredmethods which, though good  in the  past, do not correspond with present requirements.According to  the old saying, out of dispute comes truth, and the congress succeeded iiisecuring complete accord  even in regard to the burning question of army organisation.     The  tasks of the party formulated  in the programme are all  imbued with  apractical spirit; the aim  being the construction of a communist  society.   This aim canonly  be  achieved if we  know how  to  carry out such construction.   Those who arestarting the work of practical reconstruction must be inspired  with the same enthusiasmas accompanied the proletarian workers  at the barricades.  A^far-reaching programme which could never have been  set forth by the revolutionary proletariat in former timeshas now become the principal aim.    The  new programme, as  accepted by the congress,not only embodies what has been achieved already,  but  also contains an outline of thefuture in  regard to  the actual  construction  of the socialist  order.   Therefore our programme is being studied  not  only by our  party  comrades,  but also  by our WestEuropean and American comrades.     The principal political matter  was that of the attitude to be  taken by the party inregard to the  middle-class peasantry, a matter which has  become  a  burning  question.The  former position was that  a struggle existed between  the two fundamental  forces       [75.6]-451
, of the capitalist society, i.e., between  the proletariat and  the  bourgeoisie; but now that the upper bourgeoisie has been destroyed by the organised proletarian dictatorship a question arises as to the attitude of the proletariat towards the middle classes, and in this regard the congress  declared officially  that we are not the enemies but the friends of the middle-class peasantry.     The party admits that much mischief and injustice has been done in its name, but an end has been  put  to that  state of  things.   The party programme as well  as the resolutions passed by the party clearly expressed  that no repression or  violent measures should be applied in regard to the middle-class peasantry.     The  question of  organisation  in  regard to the  struggle  with  the bureaucracy was also discussed.   The  discussion was animated and a number of comrades  gave some valuable practical hints.   Finally,  Zinovieff &apos;s  association  was accepted, so  that the party has now a practical  programme  in regard to this  important question  : the party has again  solemnly confiimed the resolution of the old central  committee  that it constitutes a part of the third communist internationale.   Whilst the social traitors and the social revolutionaries of the left, who are playing revolution, are against us, we see the fraternal hands of the European  proletariat  stretched out towards us.  Tnus it was with great joy tJnat the congress received the news of the victory of tbe Hungarian proletariat.  Our friends and comrades who  have  helped to defend  the republic on almost all fronts are now at the head of the first soviet republic after Russia.     The world revolution goes forward  and so do we, as was  proved by  our congress. However difficult our position may be, we may look  forward with confidence so long as we have such  valuable workers  in  the congress.  Our party,  which  was formerly a solitary storming unit of workers tested in the revolutionary struggle, is now marching not alone,  but in union with fraternal parties and with the third  internationale. UKRAINA.     Letter  from  General  Franchet d&apos;Esperey  to  the Mayor  of Odessa. On  the 25th March Mr.  Cooke reported [Xo. 245  1 that General  Franchet d&apos;Esperey had, in consequence of  rumours circulating in the town,  written  a letter to the  mayor of Odessa which  had been  public shed  that day.   In this  letter the general had declared that the E.ntente&apos;s only  desire was  so  to  support the  local governments as to enable them to restore order and to  summon a freely  elected  constituent assembly based on universal suffrage : it had no desire to divide Russia or  to impose any  particular  form of government on her. SIBERIA.     Enemy Prisoners  of M7ar. On the 28th March Sir George Grahame telegraphed as follows [No. 581]:      The French government agrees that it is expedient both  from  a political and  from a humanitarian point of view that the Entente should assist  enemy prisoners of war in Siberia in  order to preserve them MS  far as possible from Bolshevik infection, and to present their becoming a  hindrance or even a danger to  Admiral Kolchak&apos;s government.     It was with this end in view that the  French government gave its approval to the different schemes submitted to it by the Scandinavian  Red  Gross  societies and by the American Y.M.C.A., contemplating in particular the distribution of material or pecuniary assistance to prisoners of war in Siberia, the organisation of their postal correspondence with their  respective countries,  and the  communication to the governments  of the central powers of the lists furnished by the Scandinavian delegates.     These  measures were  also  brought to the &apos;knowledge of the Swiss government, which no doubt communicated them to the governments concerned.     The French  government,  on the other hand, refused the request of the Austro- German  delegation to be5allowed to participate in this work, in view of the difficulties which the presence of such missions  might cause, and of certain  facts  with regard to Bolshevik  or German propaganda  recorded  by the  Siberian  and  Czech  military authorities.     The French government  is, therefore, quite prepared to adopt the plan suggested by the British government, namely  :      (a.)  The proposal  in principle  to be made to the central powers through a neutraL           power.     (h.)  Co-operation of  the Scandinavian,  Canadian, and American Red Crosses.     (c.)  Repayment of expenses by the central powers.
     With regard to the proposal in principle to he made to the central powers, the Swiss government seems to the French government to be the best qualified to transmit it, as they have already on various occasions acted as intermediaries between the Entente and the central powers.                                                               .\&apos;     Co-operation of the Red Cross societies could be secured by the adhesion in principle of the governments  concerned ;  and the distribution of work in Siberia could be arranged by agreement between the delegations already in the country.     In  this connection the ministry for foreign affairs thinks it necessary to point out the advantage of securing the participation of the international Red Cross committee in the common task.  The Litter, in fact, recently despatched a mission to Siberia, with the object of assisting Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war.     The Kolchak Government. On the  26th  March Sir Charles Eliot transmitted [No. 305] a message from  General Blain, who reported that  of  late  the Kolchak government had risen in general esteem; but in spite of that the future was not  free from danger, as in that province, in the  Yeniseisk  province, and perhaps in  others, Bolshevik  leaders were working among the peasantry, who were seriously discontented. Should  there be a  collapse of the Omsk  government, he had not much  doubt that MM. Semenoff,  (?) Hortat, Ivanoff,  and  Rinoff, combining  with some other leaders, would establish a powerful government in  the East, and that the influence  of Japan would  be  very  strong  therein.  In  the  hope  of  establishing better relations  with Admiral Kolchak, Admiral Tanaka had been sent to Omsk ;  but  at  the same time no effort had  been  spared to make the above-mentioned leaders more friendly  to Japan. and to  each other.                                     POLAND.     The Polish Representative in Switzerland. Sir Horace Rumbold  reported that on the 22nd March [No.  499] M. Zaleski had informed Mr.  Savery that  M. Dmowski  had now agreed to M. Modzelewski succeeding  him as representative in Switzerland of the Warsaw government.     Another difficulty had, however, arisen.  Two or three days earlier  M.  Zaleski had received his letters of recall, and at the same  time M.  Modzelewski  received his letters  of appointment, in which he was described as charge d&apos;affaires ;  but he  refuses to accept the post of Polish representative here unless he is given the rank  of minister, so the matter had of necessity to be referred back to Warsaw.     If the government there did not see its way  to meet M.  Modzelewski&apos;s  wishes in this matter, M.  Zaleski thought that it would very  likely choose M.  Zoltowski, who had long resided at Kribourg, to be  their representative in  Switzerland.   M.  Zaleski spoke of  .  Zoltowski as &quot;amiable, but colourless.&quot;     M.  Zaleski thought it was  practically certain that he himself would be appointed to Copenhagen.     The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. On the 27th  March Sir  Horace  Rumbold reported [No. 539] that M. Zaleski had stated that M. de Skrzynski intended to proceed to Warsaw in the near future,  certainly before Easter, to  take  up his post  as under secretary of state for f..reign affairs.     Telegraphing again on the  30th March [No.  560 I he reported that M. de Skrzynski had stated that it was the intention of his government to establish  embassies  in the chief allied countries.                                     TURKEY.     Commercial Activities of the C.U.P. The War Otfice &quot; Summary of Information,&quot; No. 819 ^27th March;, says  that&apos; the commercial activities of the C.U.P. date from September 1916.  Their origin  may perhaps have been due to  a desire to provide a new source of income in place of that previously derived from the  Armenian deportations, a source which was at that time, running dry.     Whatever the motive,-the practical effect of the movement was to create something like a  Moslem  trade  monopoly which resulted  in  huge profits,  most of  which were divided  between corrupt officials and  the CUP.  party funds.     The committee  was greatly assisted in  its  task by the hold it had on the  various trade guilds  of Constantinople.     Its most important foundation was the Milli Idhilat Kantarieh (National Weighers&apos; Association), with a capital oi    T. 2uO,(&apos;0O, which in the first year made a profit of about   T. 260,000, mostly out of the provisioning of Constantinople.   Other smaller and
, ^subsidiary companies, subsequently formed, were devoted to various activities, such as- buying up cereals.      The committee also took a big hand in finance, and founded the Milli Banca (Credit National Ottoman), with a  capital of  T. 4,000,000, the manager of which was an Austrian named Weil.  Other smaller banks were also founded.      At about the time of the armistice an attack on the commercial supremacy of the committee was begun by Tzzet Bey, with the support of the ministry of the interior.      It  is doubtful whether he  would have  succeeded if it  had  not  been for  the armistice, but after the  latter event both the  Entente and  the Turkish authorities made it plain that the attack was to be pressed home, and the main concerns are now under the control of the Entente.&apos;:                            SYRIA AND  PALESTINE.      Inter-allied Commission.- On the 28th March  Lord Curzon informed [No. Ill] General Clayton that, with the object of a report  being made to the peace conference on the question of mandates  after ascertaining  the  wishes of the population,  it had been decided to send an inter-allied commission to Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia.      Feeling against  the  Zionists. On the  26th  March  General Clayton reported No.  83  that of late  there had been  a very considerable  increase in Palestine of propaganda against the  Zio-lists.   Moslems and Christians alike feared that  in  the peace settlement political and economic advantages might be given to the Jews, and, in consequence, feeling  was running very high.    The  pronouncement made by leading Zionists in the press, and the rash actions  and words of other Jews, had increased this feeling.   There was a belief that outbreaks against the Jews  were being  prepared in, various places, timongst others Jaffa and Jerusalem, and there were considerable grounds ,for so believing.                                     ARABIA.      King  hussiens  Subsidy. On  the  26th  March  General  Allenby  telegraphed [No. 441] pointing  out  that as a considerable time must needs elapse before Ibn  Saud could receive and give effect to the message which was being sent  to him, King Hussein would, for  the  present, be  obliged to retain a defensive force  east of  Mecca.   He recommended that the subsidy for April should be  at least IOO,0O0L; if the situation developed favourably it  might be reduced by .  20 per cent, in May.  General Allenby remarked  that King  Hussein would hardly regard  the reduction  by one-half of Ibn Saud&apos;s subsidy as an indication of our disapproval of the Wahabi aggression, if at the same time we reduced his own by one-third.      Replying  to this on the 29th  March [No. 394] Lord Curzon informed General Allenby that on the understanding that every  effort  would be  made (1) to induce King Hussein to furnish a satisfactory statement of his  liabilities, and  (2)  to reduce the amount of the May subsidy  to 80,O00L, sanction had been given for the payment of 100,OOOL for April.      The Message to  Ibn Saud. On  the .31st March  General  Allenby  transmitted [No. 463] the following message from Baghdad :  Before  the message had left  Bahrein a representative from [?] Ibn Saud arrived  with a letter asking for the appointment of a boundary commission, and professing complete  devotion to the governments  interests. The  message has  therefore been held up.      General Allenby himself telegraphed [No.  464] saying that he considered, as the delivery of the message  had  been delayed, that the opportunity should  be taken to urge its being strengthened on the  lines  suggested  by  himself and General Clayton. The approach of the pilgrimage, he said, rendered the removal of any Wahabite threat against Hejaz  a matter of urgency.                                 AFGHANISTAN.      Proclamation of Policy. On the 21st March the viceroy of India reported that the Amir had issued a proclamation containing a pronouncement of policy, to  the effect that Afghanistan should possess in their entirety all rights of government possessed by other independent states; in other words, that it should be independent both  internally and externally.
