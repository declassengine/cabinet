On the 26th May the following notewas sent to Admiral Kolchak by the chiefs of the peace conference :      The allied and associated powers feel that the time has come when it is necessaryfor them once more to make clear the policy they propose to pursue in regard to Russia.It  has always  been a cardinal axiom of the allied  and associated  powers to avoidinterference in the internal affairs of Russia.   Their original intervention  was made  forthe sole purpose of assisting  those elements in Russia  which wanted to continue thestruggle against German autocracy and to free their country  from German rule, and inorder to rescue  the Czecho-Slovaks from the danger of annihilation at  the hands  of theBolshevik forces.   Since  the signature of the armistice  on  the 11th November, 1918,they have kept forces in  various parts of Russia.  Munitions and supplies have beensent to assist  those associated with  them at  a  very considerable cost.   No  sooner,however, did the peace conference assemble than they endeavoured to bring peace andorder to Russia by inviting representatives of all the warring governments within russia to meet them in the hope that they might be able to arrange a permanent solution ofRussian problems.   This proposal and a later offer to relieve the distress among thesuffering millions of Russia broke down through the refusal of the soviet government to-accept the fundamental  condition of suspending hostilities  while negotiations or thework of relief were proceeding.  Some of the allied and associated governments are nowbeing pressed to withdraw their troops and to incur no further expense in  Russia on theground that continued intervention shows no prospect of producing an early settlement.They are prepared, however, to continue their assistance on  the lines  laid down belowprovided they are satisfied that it will really help the Russian people to liberty, self-government, and peace.     The allied and associated governments now wish to declare formally that the objectof their policy is to restore peace within Russia by enabling the Russian people to resumecontrol of their own affairs through the  instrumentality of a freely-elected constituent
 assembly and  to  restore  peace  along its  frontiers  by arranging for the  settlement of disputes  in  regard to  the  boundaries of the Russian state and its relations with its neighbours  through  the  peaceful arbitration  of the  league  of nations.   They  are convinced by their experiences of the last twelve months that it is not possible to attain these ends by dealings with  the soviet government of Moscow.  They are, therefore, disposed  to assist  the  government  of  Admiral  Kolchak  and  his  associates with munitions, supplies, and food  to establish themselves as the government of All-Russia, provided  they  receive from them  definite  guarantees that their policy has  the same objects in view as that of the allied  and associated  powers.   With  this object they would ask Admiral Kolchak and his associates whether they will ayree to  the following as  the conditions upon which  they accept  continued assistance from the allied  and associated powers :       1.  As soon as they reach  Moscow they will  summon a constituent assembly, elected by a free, secret,  and democratic  franchise,  as  the  supreme  legislature for Russia, to which the government of  Russia must  be  responsible, or  if at  that time order is  not sufficiently restored they will summon the  constituent assembly elected in 1917 to sit until such time as new elections are possible.      2.  Throughout the areas which they at present control  they will permit free elections in the normal course for all local and legally-constituted assemblies, such as municipalities, zemstvos, &amp;c.      3.  They will  countenance no attempt to  revive the special privileges of any class or order in Russia.   The allied and associated  powers  have  noted with  satisfaction  the solemn declarations made  by Admiral Kolchak  and his associates  that they have no intention  of restoring  the former land system.  They feel that the  principles to be followed in the solution of this and other internal questions  must  be  left to  the   free decision of the Russian constituent assembly, but  they wish to  be  assured that those whom they are prepared to assist stand for the  civil and religious liberty of all Russian citizens, and will  make no attempt to reintroduce the regime which the revolution has destroyed.     4.  That the independence of Finland and Poland be recognized, and in the event of the frontiers and other relations between Russia and these countries not  being settled by agreement,  they will be referred to the arbitration of the league of nations.     5.  That if a solution of the relations between Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and  the Caucasian and Transcaspian territories and Russia is not speedily reached by agreement the settlement will be made in consultation and  co-operation with the league of nations, and that until  such settlement  is made the  government of Russia  agrees to recognize these territories as autonomous and to  confirm the relations which may exist between their de facto governments and the allied and associated governments.     6.  That  the  right of  the peace  conference  to determine  the future  of   the Rumanian part of Bessarabia be recognized.     7.  That as soon as  a government  for Russia has been constituted on a democratic basis Russia  should join the league of nations and co-operate with the other members in the limitation of armaments and of military organization throughout the world.     8.  That they abide by the declaration made by Admiral  Kolchak  on the 27th November, 1918, in regard to Russia&apos;s national debts.     To this Admiral Kolchak  sent the following reply :      The government over which I preside has been happy to  learn  that the policy of the  allied and  associated  powers in  regard to Russia is in perfect accord with  the task  which  the  Russian government itself has undertaken, that government being anxious above  all things  to re-establish  peace  in  the country and  to  assure to  the Russian people  the  right  to  decide their own destiny in freedom by means of  a constituent- assembly.   I  appreciate  highly the  interest shown  by the powers as regards  the national  movement,  and  consider  their  wish  to make certain  of  the political conviction with which  we are inspired as  legitimate.   I am therefore readyto  confirm  once  more my  previous declarations,  which I have always regarded as irrevocable.     1.  On the 18th  November, 1918, I  assumed  power, and  I shall not retain that power one day  longer than is required by the  interest of the country.  My first thought at the  moment when the Bolsheviks  are definitely crushed will be to fix the date for the  elections of the  constituent assembly.   A  commission is now at work  on direct preparation  for  them  on  the basis  of  universal  suffrage.   Considering myself as responsible before that  constituent assembly, I shall hand over to it  all  my powers in
order that it may freely determine the system of government.   I  have, moreover, taken the oath to do this  before the supreme Russian tribunal, the guardian of legality.  all my efforts are aimed at  concluding the  civil  war  as soon  as  possible  by crushing-Bolshevism in order to put the Russian people effectively in a position  to express itsfree will.  Any prolongation of this struggle would only postpone that moment.   Thegovernment, however, does  not  consider  itself authorized  to  substitute  for  theinalienable right of free and legal elections the mere re-establishment of the assembly of1917, which was elected under a regime of  Bolshevik violence, and the majority of whose members are now in the sovietist ranks.  It is to the legally elected constituentassembly alone, which my government  will do its utmost to convoke promptly, thatthere will bel mg  the sovereign rights of deciding the problems of the Russian state,both in  the internal and external affairs of the country.     2.  We gladly consent to  discuss at once with the powers all international questions,and in doing so shall aim at the free and peaceful development  of peoples, the limitationof armaments, and the measures calculated to prevent new wars, of which the league  ofnations  is the highest expression.  The  Russian government thinks, however, that itshould recall the fact that the final sanction of the decisions which may be taken in thename of  Russia  will  belong to the constituent assembly.   Russia  cannot now,  and cannot in future, ever be anything but a democratic state where all questions involvingmodifications of the  territorial frontiers and of external relations must be ratified by arepresentative body which is the natural expression of the people&apos;s sovereignty.     3.  Considering the creation of a unified Polish  state to be one of the chief of thenormal  and just consequences of the world war, the  government  thinks  itself justifiedin  confirming  the  independence  of Poland proclaimed by  the provisional  Russiangovernment of 1917, all the pledges and decrees of which we have accepted.  The final solution of the question of delimiting the frontiers between Russia and Poland must,however, in  conformity with the principles set forth above, be postponed till the meetingof the  constituent  assembly.   We are disposed at  once   to  recognize  the de  factogovernment of Finland, but the  final solution of the Finnish question must belong  tothe constituent assembly.     4.  We  are fully disposed at once to  prepare  for the solution of the questions concerning the fate of the  national groups in Esthonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania, and  ofthe Caucasian and  Transcaspian  countries, and  we have every reason to believe that aprompt  settlement  will be made, seeing that the government is  assuring, as from thepresent  time, the  autonomy  of the various nationalities.   It is needless to say thatthe limits and conditions of these autonomous  institutions will be settled separately asregards each of the nationalities concerned.   And even in  case difficulties  should arise in regard to the solution  of these various questions, the government is  ready to have recourse to the collaboration  and good offices  of  the league of nations with a view toarriving at a satisfactory settlement.     5.  The  above  principle,  implying the ratification  of  the agreements  by theconstituent assembly, should obviously be applied to  the question  of Bessarabia.     6.  The Russian  government once more repeats its declaration of the 27th Novem-ber, 1918, by which it accepted the.burden of the national debt of Russia.     7.  As regards the question of internal politics,  which can only interest the powers in so far as  they reflect  the political tendencies of the Russian  government, I make apoint of repeating  that there cannot be a return to the regime which existed in Russiabefore February, 1917.  The provisional solution which my government has adopted inregard to the agrarian question aims at satisfying the interests of the great mass of thepopulation, and is  inspired by the conviction that Russia can only  be flourishing and strong when the millions of Russian peasants receive all guarantees for the possession ofthe  land.  Similarly as regards the  regime to be applied  to the liberated territories the  government, far from  placing obstacles in  the way of  the free election of localassemblies, municipalities,  and  zemstvos, regards the activities of these bodies and thedevelopment of the  principle of  self-government as the  necessary  conditions for thereconstruction&apos; of the  country, and is already actually giving them its support and helpby all the means at its disposal.     8.  Having set  ourselves the task of re-establishing  order and justice and of ensuringindividual security to the persecuted population which is tired  of trials and exactions[? executions], the  government affirms the equality before the law of all classes and allcitizens  without any special privilege.   All shall [? enjoy]  without distinction of originor of religion the protection of the state and of the  law.   The government whose headI am is concentrating all  the forces  and all  the resources  at  its disposal in order to accomplish the task  which  it has set itself at this decisive hour.  I  speak in the name
of all  national  Russia.   I am confident that Bolshevism  once crushed,  satisfactory&quot;solutions  will be  found for all questions which equally concern all  the  populationswhose existence is bound up with that of Russia.     The  receipt  of  Admiral  Kolchaks  note  was  acknowledged  in  the  following terms .:      The allied and associated powers wish to acknowledge receipt of Admiral Kolchak&apos;reply to their note of the 26th May.   They welcome the tone of that reply, which seemsto  them   to be  in  substantial  agreement with the  propositions  which  they  had made,  and to contain satisfactory assurances for the freedom,  self-government,  and peace of the Russian people and their neighbours.  They are, therefore, willing to extend-to Admiral Kolchak and his associates the support set forth in  their original letter.     Repression of  Bolsheviks  in the  Yenisei  District  [E.R.  CXX,  p. 3]. ColonelRobertson transmitted  on  the  10th  June [No. 531] a telegram  sent  from Omsk byMr.  Hodgson reporting that the  action of the military authorities in regard to therepression of the Bolshevik outrages in Yenisei district was under consideration.  He hadbeen so informed by the minister for foreign affairs who had added that his governmentwas entirely opposed to such unjust and arbitrary measures as those to which attentionhad been called by the vice-consul at Krasnoyarsk.     Resignation  of  the Minister of  War. On the 11th June  Colonel  Robertsontransmitted [No. 534] another message from Mr. Hodgson who reported that one resultof the failure of the western  army  had  been  the resignation of the  minister of Avar,-General Stepanoff.  He would  not be replaced, as it had been decided that GeneralLebedeff, chief of the general staff, should be directly responsible to Admiral Kolchak.     Reasons for  the increase  of  Bolshevism in Siberia. On the 10th June ColonelRobertson transmitted  [No. 528]  a message from Sir Charles  Eliot who, in  reply to an inquiry, gave the reasons for  the increase of Bolshevism in Siberia as they appearedto him :      The Omsk government could point  to no great  military success, and at the sametime it was  often, in its attempts to  repress revolutionary movements, both arbitraryand unjust;  further it did but little to improve the conditions of life though it promised.much; and the continuance of unsatisfactory conditions made itself more and more felt as time went on.  The Bolshevik  leaders on  their part kept up  a continual agitation;.and active manifestations were easier in summer than in winter.     Among  the particular causes for the spread of Bolshevism three might be mentioned.First of all the influence of prisoners who returning from Germany through european russia had become tainted therewith :  and in this connexion it might be noted that a con-siclerable percentage of  German and Magyar prisoners in Siberia [especially the latter],who Avere reported to be under but slight supervision, had Bolshevik sympathies.  then there  was the enormous increase in prices, which had followed  on the depreciation ofthe rouble; and this increase was attributed to the government,  the people contrasting-present prices with those which prevailed a year  ago  under  the Bolshevik regime.And, thirdly, the  active propaganda kept up by the  soviet government which made inparticular every effort to having over the soldiers.     In a telegram, sent on the 7th  June [No. 521], dealing with the same subject,Colonel Robertson set out a number of causes which were favourable to this Bolshevik propaganda.   In  the first place he set  the fact of the Bolshevik regime  in Siberiahaving been  overthrown before the population had fully  experienced its evils ; it  onlyremembered  that high wages  with little work had prevailed during that regime, andthat there was comparative freedom  from  compulsory military service and taxation  :the present  compulsory mobilization  was resented :  and the taxes were unpopular  as-the  peasantry believed that, the government being &quot; temporary,&quot; they would be  againcollected  when  the new one  came into  power.   At the same time the  people  wereirritated by the repressive acts  of  some government  officials and  by the  many  illegalacts of some government troops :  the peasants, too, were driven  to the Bolsheviks byattempts to disarm them, the uncertainty of the situation making them indisposed  togive up their arms.  And, finally,  on account of  its interference with  the Siberian.duma,  the zemstovs,  and similar representative institutions, the  government was  in.many  quarters regarded as reactionary.
TURKESTAN.     Desire  for Diplomatic  Relations  with  Afghanistan. On the  11th June  thefollowing reply to the Afghan minister for foreign  affairs was  sent by Mr. Karakhan,&quot; deputy people&apos;s commissary &quot;  :      Having received by wireless the text of  the letter from  his highness AmanullaKhan and your accompanying letter, we are hereby sending our reply;  the originaldocument will be entrusted for  delivery to a special mission.  In the name of the work-men&apos;s and peasants&apos; government we express our sincere  desire to  enter into  directdiplomatic relations with the Afghans, who have thrown off their foreign yoke.....     We propose  that the  Afghanistan government should  appoint  a diplomaticrepresentative to Moscow, and that we on our  side should send one to  Kabul.....        [See p. *8 for the appointment of an Afghan consul-general at Tashkend.]     The Bolsheviks and the Turcomans. The  army department of the government ofIndia reported on the 14th June  [No.  8051] that,  on the ground of a  common pro-gramme for  the freedom of Asia,  the Bolsheviks had  entered  into close relations withKhiva.  They would probably win over a great majority of the Yamut by the offer of autonomy to the-Turcomans,  and possibly a large number of the Tekeke.                                    GREECE.     Treaty  with the  Jugo-Slavs. On  the  11th  June Sir  Rennell Rodd reported[No. 407] the existence of an agreement between  Greece  and  the Jugo-Slavs :  it wassecret, but he had  obtained a cojay.   Sir  Rennell said that the most interesting articles in the agreement were those which asserted the necessity of the two peoples, Greek andJugo-Slav, (1) having a similar  and energetic policy in regard to maritime affairs, and (2)making every  effort  to  prevent any  power from obtaining the hegemony  of the adriatic.  Greece would help in the development of the new Jugo-Slav merchant navy,and both powers would work for  ensuring not only the right  of all  peoples to have access to the open seas, but also for  the freedom of the seas.   The agreement waspreliminary  to  an  economic alliance, and it contained conventions protecting marketsagainst foreign  competition, and clauses relating to  a  common base for a customsregime.                                    TURKEY.     The Delegates to  the Conference. In  telegrams  dated the 10th and 16th June[Nos. 1239 and 1264], Admiral Calthorpe reported the departure of Ferid Pasha andTewfik Pasha for Paris, the  former travelling on a French  battleship and the latter onH.M.S. Ceres.  Ferid and Tewfik have as colleagues  Tewfik Bey, minister of finance,Reshid Khaliss, minister designate to Switzerland, and Riza Tewfik,  president  of thecouncil of state.     The  Crown Prince  and  the National Party. Telegraphing on the 17th June[No.  1276 and 1284] Admiral Calthorpe reported that  the   sultan  was very muchalarmed at the intrigues of the  national party which, he believed, threatened his  throneand perhaps his life.  The situation was in fact growing both complicated and serious.The national party, which included all relics of the C.U.P., had practically capturedthe ministry of war and had  made  great progress in that of [?] foreign affairs : and now  it had succeeded  in inducing&apos; the crown prince, Abdul Mejid, to  become  itsfigurehead.  The  crown prince,  who  during  Ramazan, had courted popular favour  byfrequenting  different  mosques each night,  had  on  the  16th addressed  what was practically an ultimatum to the sultan :  in this he had asked for the   dismissal  of thegrand vizier and  the appointment of Tewfik Pasha  as  chief of the  delegation to thepeace conference  on  the  ground  that the  safety of the empire and  the Ottomansultanate demanded that they should be represented at the conference by  a statesmanof all-round knowledge and experience of the kind  that Tewfik Pasha  alone possessed.Admiral Calthorpe  added that  there was  reason for thinking that  the French were interested in the movement which was being beaded by Abdul Mejid.       [756]-725                                  &apos;                      C
                                   ARMENIA.    Immigration  of Kurds.-On the  13th  June  Lord  Curzon  informed admiral calthorpe [Nos. 1007 and 1008J  that, relying on information received  from a  well-informed source, the Armenian delegation in Paris had, alleged that Kurdish activity was being stimulated to establish a Kurdish majority in certain districts of Armenia,especially in the Van province, partly by preventing the return of refugees from persia and the Caucasus.   The movement was said to  have been organized by  the ex-vali ofVan, Haidar Bey,  and to  be  carried on  under  the  guidance of the C.U.P. with thecompliance of the  Turkish government.  The Djelali tribes were said to  be  already inpossession of the valley of Haiotz Tzor, and the Arroussanli in that of the villages ofthe Ardjak and Kharakonis region.  The  civil  commissioner of Baghdad was of opinionthat the  report was probably based on  facts, and  feared  that further  measures todecrease the number of Armenians were certainly  threatened: he believed that inevery  district of  Armenia a  Kurdish  majority already existed.   In  the  event of admiral Calthorpe agreeing with these views  he was instructed to take any steps toprevent  the  movement he might consider practicable.   Lord Curzon mentioned someof the chief agents of the  movement, among whom was Semko.                                    ARABIA.    Ibn Saud&apos;s reply to British Ultimatum [E.R. cxx iii,  p.  5]. On  14th  JuneGeneral  Allenby  transmitted [Nos.  969  and&apos;970]  telegrams he  had received form colonel C. E. Wilson (Jeddah) who sent a translation of Ibn Saud&apos;s reply to the Britishultimatum with his own comments thereon.   With these General Allenby at the  sametime sent a third telegram [No. 971]  containing his observations on Colonel Wilson&apos;scomments.    Ibn Saud in his letter, dated  9th  June, stated  in the first place  that it wasuntrue that he had  disregarded  the  advice  of the  British government and that theAkhwan had advanced into Hejaz.    He had sent  several letters to the British govern-ment through the  consul at Bahrein  and  the political  officers in Iraq,  whom  he had asked to judge between him and  King Hussein.   He had not taken one span  of landnot included in the agreement between him and the  British government : Tarabah andKhurma formed part of Nejd, morally and  materially, and  Great Britain had promisedhim assistance against aggression.  He had both considered the  articles of the treatymade with the British government and acted in accordance with them.    He had notified the British officials  of the advance of King Hussein&apos;s troops andhad to  this day received no reply to  his letter: he had awaited one for a month, andnothing was done by his people till they had been  attacked by the sherifan forces.  Hehad written to King Hussein asking him to retire  to his own country that the  troublesmight be settled by Great Britain : King Hussein did  not reply to this, but said thathis forces were intended rather for Riadh  and El Hasa  than for Tarabah and Khurmato destroy the heretics, meaning  the people of Nejd.     He, Ibn Saud, had no object beyond defending his  country and securing its rights.He was submissive to the British representations, and if the British government wishedhim to retire, he asked for a guarantee till it had adjudicated upon the case.   He couldnot now retire on account of the unrest in Nejd  caused by King hussiens attack onthat country and its religion : but if Great Britain would give  a  satisfactory guarantee that the aggressive action of Hejaz should be stopped pending  judgment, he wouldretire with his entire force.     Commenting  on this letter Colonel Wilson noted  that it was evident that  therewould be no unconditional compliance on  the part of Ibn  Saud,   He  said that he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that the most advisable course was to make a virtueof the difficulties mentioned in Ibn Saud&apos;s letter  as springing from the unrest amongthe tribes, and to arrange a  meeting with him.  Were this settled it would  of course be  insisted upon  that  Ibn Saud should  withdraw his forces east of  Qunsaliya andguarantee  the safety of. the mission, a guarantee  being given that the Hejaz force should not move east of the Taif-Asheira line till after  the meeting.     If  his  majesty&apos;s government should approve  the   proposed meeting, he suggestedthat King Hussein should be asked to depute the Emir Abdulla as his  representative.The king himself  was in an  hysterical condition and  his strongest  opposition to theproposed meeting  was anticipated:  but Abdulla might  help them to overcome it.     General Allenby  agreed  with  Colonel  C. E. Wilson that the preferable course\
would be to arrange for a meeting between Abdulla, Ibn  Saud, Colonel C. E. Wilson,and Colonel Wilson of Baghdad ;  the meeting to be held somewhere east of Taif.     On the 18th June  Lord Cufzon telegraphed [No. 745] his approval of the proposed meeting  at which  he presumed that something  in the nature of British arbitration was contemplated.   As the  suspension of hostilities was a necessary preliminary to discussionof any kind, the first thing to he  done was to send an agent  to Ibn Saud to induce himto stop,  pending arbitration ;  for this  Mr.  Philby  had. been selected and would proceedto Cairo by air with the least possible delay.   Ibn Saud should certainly withdraw his forces from Tarabah at  any  rate,  but at  the  same time Mr.  Philby  should be in aposition  to guarantee  that  in the  event of his  doing so the  British government wouldarbitrate between him and King Hussein at the  earliest possible  date.                                  MESOPOTAMIA.     Feeling at Kerbela.-The political agent at Baghdad reported [No.  6564] on the 11th June that he had been to Nejef and Kerbela and had in both places interviewed some of the leading  inhabitants.  At Kerbela he found that the leading mujtahid* was in his dotage  and, was. anti-British,  partly  through the influence of a  gang of unscrupulous money-makers by whom  he is surrounded.  The second of the mujtahids resented the check which had been placed on his money-making  by the judicial system now being organized  : he was notoriously  venal.  The other two of the four leading mujtahids whom he had spoken  to were not persons of great influence, but otherwise they were satisfactory from every point of view.    &apos; He found that  the mujtahids were by no means favourable to an Arab government, and still less to a Turkish one : some apparently would have liked a Persian regime, on religious  grounds, but the experiences of their colleagues in  Persia in recent years  had not encouraged this sentimental wish.  The dislike of Turkish officials, even when they were Arabs, was as strong as ever.  The  political officer had announced that it  was intended  to appoint a shiah officer as assistant political officer at Kerbela in the near future : this undoubtedly had given  satisfaction, though one  mujtahid  reminded  him grimly that the only  shiah official in  the executive charge of  a  district  (Saiyid  Sadik of  be led) had recently been punished for extortion by torture.                                      PEBSIA.     The Urumia trouble. On the 12th June.  Sir  Percy Cox  reported [No. 423] that the whole trouble at Urumia had arisen from  the anonymous despatch to Simko of a bomb which had exploded and injured  30  persons, 25 being  wounded and 5  killed  among the latter was Shuko&apos;s  brother.  In  consequence of this, Simko had  ordered the Kurds  to  disarm every Persian  in  Khoi,  Salmas, and Urumia.   At  the  last mentioned, however, the Persians had driven the Kurds out of the town ; and  then, it would  seem, they  attacked the American  mission  compound  because  Kurds  had collected there.   The  consul  at  Tabriz, had, Sir Percy said, received a very  friendly- message from  Simko, who was  reported to  have  refused to  join the Van movement-against the return of the Armenians, and to be entirely friendly to Christians.     [In Lord  Curzon&apos;s telegram to  Admiral  Calthorpe  on  the movement  for  the          immigration  of Kurds into Armenia [above p. 6], Semko is mentioned as  one          of its  chief agents.]           ,                                  AFGHANISTAN.     Mission to  the Peace  Conference.
