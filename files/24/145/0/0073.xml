Mr. Lenin&apos;s Interview with the  Unipress. In a wireless message from Moscow toTashkent it is stated that Mr. Lenin  received an invitation from an American journalistto answer the following five questions :      1. Has the Russian soviet republic made any alterations in its initial programme ?     2. What are the activities of the Russian soviet republic regarding Afghanistan andother Moslem countries outside Russia ?     3. What are the political and economic aims of soviet Russia as  regards Americaand Japan  ?     4. What are the  conditions under  which Russia agrees to conclude  peace with admiral Kolchak and with Generals  Denikin and Mannerheim ?     5. What does  Mr.  Lenin  specially  wish to  communicate  for  American  publicopinion ?     The answer to the first question is that the soviet government has  one aim, viz.,the overthrow of the landowners&apos; and capitalists&apos; yoke.     The answer to the second question is that the attitude of the soviet government to afghanistan,  India, and  other  Moslem countries  outside Russia is  the  same  as theattitude adopted by the soviet government towards the Moslem and other  non-Russianpeople  within Russia.  Every  assistance  is  given to  the  independent and  freedevelopment of  every  nationality.     The answer to the third question is that the first aim of the soviet  republic  is torepel the  shameless  invasion  of Russia by America and Japan.   Soviet Russia hasmany times offered peace to these two states, but has received no answer.     The answer to the fourth question is that the conditions under which  the  russian soviet republic agrees to conclude peace have been clearly set forth.     It is not our fault that the governments in the  United  States and other countriesdo not make these documents public and conceal the truth from their  peoples.  We areprepared to make peace, and even to pay our debts to France and other countries, butit must be a peace formally signed.
     The answer to the fifth question is :      Capitalism has outlived itself, and has become a reactionary hindrance  to  humandevelopment.   No power  whatever  will  be.able to stop tbe revolution  now  that ithas  spread all  over the world.   The success  of the  soviet republic of all  peoples isassured.     Soviet Order Regarding  Mobilisation.-The following  decree was sent out from moscow by wireless on the 8th August :      In order to fill posts in the commissariat of the army and  in  organizations doingwork connected with  the army  at the front,  the workmen s and peasants&apos; soviet ofdefence has decided to call up the following persons for service in the army at the front :All officials who in the  old army occupied the  posts  of treasurers, secretaries  of  thearmy commissariat in the army  at the front  and at all headquarters of divisions  andcorps, and also clerks of all military  administrative boards  and  institutions, with  theexception of clerks formerly employed at the regional  headquarters and in the depart-ments of the former ministry for war.   The above  officials are subject to mobilization if their contemporaries have already been mobilized.  Not less than 25 per cent,  of  theabove military officials of the old army, must be selected from all institutions  both civil and military, not later  than  the 15th August.  Results of the  mobilization must be reported as soon as possible to the All-Russian  general headquarters.     A Moslem Bolshevik. The Moslem poet Narimanoff, who is of Tartar descent, is nowat the head of the Moslem Orient section of the  people&apos;s commissariat for foreign affairs.He is an old communist, revolutionary, who for many years has taken part  in the move-ment in tlie Caucasus and Persia, where he  played an important  part during the firstrevolution.  He also  took up a prominent position in Baku in  1905, and was banishedfor  five years to Astrakhan, where he entered  into  relations  with Shaum Jan,  thefamous Armenian communist.  His  works,  which  number  some 14 volumes, have a wide circulation in the whole Moslem Orient.  His historical drama, &quot; Naclir-i-Shah,&quot;had a powerful influence on the political life of Persia.     General Denikin&apos;s Army. The following communiques were issued by the WarOffice on the 11th and 12th August:      1. Along the Caspian coast the right wing of the volunteers under  General  Erdelihave regained the ground lost a few  weeks  ago.    They have  occupied  Alabujinskaya,85  miles  from Astrakhan, and have landed parties oh the Coast at Olonicheva, 65 milesfrom the  port.   Over 1,000  enemy  deserters have  come  over  to the volunteers  ohthis front.     To the east of the Volga a partisan corps attached to  General Denikin&apos;s  army  hasraided the Urbakh-Astrakhan  railway at Djanibok, half-way between  the two  places,has  torn up the  line, destroyed the railway defences, and  taken a  large number ofprisoners.     To the west  of the Volga Bolshevik cavalry attacks north of Kamyshin  have been repulsed and  the  volunteers are now completing the  occupation  of the Kamyshin-Balashoff railway, three-quarters of which is in their hands.    Bolshevik counter-attacks against this railway  have, however, gained some ground near Yelan, 50 miles south-east of Balashoff.     The Bolsheviks have gained ground south of Lysky junction, but a  counter-attack of the volunteers  against their left flank has stopped their progress and has been pushed forward to a point 65 miles south-east of Voronozh.     Heavy fighting is taking place 60 miles south-west and west of Kharkoff, wherethe  volunteers have gained ground.     Partly, no doubt, as  a  result of the naval action fought  at the  mouth of  the dnieper, and of the bombardment  of Ochakoff, that town, distant less  than 40  miles east of Odessa on the  coast, has been occupied by the volunteers.  Thus only about50 miles of Black Sea coast remain in possession of the Bolsheviks.     2. Further details  as to General Denikin&apos;s successes  show that  his advance is continuing on fhe greater part of the South  Russian front against considerable enemy resistance.                                                           &apos;           &apos; :     The latest reports  give the  results of the capture of Kamyshin on the 28th Julyas  being  even  greater than  was  at  first  estimated.  The  total  of the capturesincludes 11,000 prisoners,  60  guns, 150 machine guns, and an immense amount ofmaterial.  The fighting around this city was extremely severe, and two crack  Bolshevik
divisions, the 37th and. 39th, were completely shattered by the  repeated  and gallantattacks of the volunteer troops.     Meanwhile,  General  Denikin&apos;s  advanced  cavalry,  pushing  out towards  theUfbakh-Astrakhan railway, have effected  a junction with the left wing  of the  UralCossacks near Lake Eltonskoe, 85 miles south-east of Kamyshin.     The effect of this junction  with the Cossacks, who form the left wing of AdmiralKolchaks Siberian army, is bound to be great, as now a united anti-Bolshevik  frontexists along the whole of East and South Bussia from the northern Urals to the north-west corner of the Black Sea, and in this latter area, as has been already  stated, only50 miles seperate General Denikin&apos;s left wing from  the right  wing of the  Rumanianarmy along the Dniester.     The booty  taken at the  capture  of Poltava  on  July 30 included  136  railwayengines, over  1,200 wagons, two armoured trains,  20 guns,  with their  ammunition,and other  material  of war.   The  population of Poltava, like that of Kharkoff and theother cities liberated by the volunteers,  displayed intense  enthusiasm on the arrival oftheir deliverers.     Further south,  along the  middle  Dnieper, a  Bolshevik  force  has  been  routedeast  of Kremontchug, with a loss of over  1,000 prisoners and six guns, while in theKherson area Bolshevik attempts to cross the Dniester which they claimed had met with some success have been defeated  and  the  Bolshevik troops thrown back to theirstarting-point.OMSK: GOVERNMENT.     Bolshevik Successes. Telegraphing from  Omsk on  the  6th  August. Sir CharlesEliot reported [No. 15] that Admiral Kolchak had issued proclamations announcing thatall land was to be given up to the Labouring classes,  and that, as soon as the Bolshevikshad  been defeated, elections for the constituent assembly  would  be held.   Meanwhile,Sir Charles Eliot further reported that the  Bolsheviks  had not  only  cut  the  railwaycommunication with the southern army but had also taken the towns of Shadrinsk andCheliabrisk.     Admiral Kolchak himself had said that  the Bolsheviks  were successful becausethey were better disciplined.     The reports  from the  front indicated  no  improvement in the morale  of men orofficers, whiist letters from  Tomsk reported that batches of men were continually joining the Bolsheviks after deserting from the reinforcements  which  were being sent to thefront.   The Tomsk  letters also reported  that there  was  a  considerable  party  who,though  not  Bolsheviks  themselves,  preferred  the  Bolsheviks  to  the Kolchakgovernment.NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Reconstruction  of  the  Government. On  the 10th August  Mr. Hoare reported[No.  520] that  a reconstruction  of the government had that  day been  announced.Three unpopular ministers  had  resigned.    There, was to  be  a representative of thetown councils in the government and  another  of the zemstvos.   The  mayor [? ofArchangel], who  had a  good  reputation, was  minister of the interior; a director oflabour had been appointed;  and the acting minister  for  foreign affairs had  dropped the title  and the functions of governor-general.     The Provisional Government on the  Allied  Occupation. On the  7th  AugustMr. Hoare telegraphed [No. 512] from Archangel as  follows :      The provisional government  has addressed  to  me and my colleagues a long notereviewing the favourable results of the allied occupation and the effect which would beproduced throughout Russia by the withdrawal of the allied forces.     The main  points are that order and security have been assured, but that in viewof the  great extent  of territory, the scarcity of population,  and the  poverty of the region, Northern Russia cannot  possibly stand alone either  from a  military, a financial,or a  food point of view.     The presence of the allied  forces has  given the population an assurance that the liberation of Russia will be definitely accomplished.   The withdrawal of the allied forces would be represented in Bolshevik propaganda as a victory over the allies.   Apart fromits moral effect, the  reduction of the military forces at  the  front would  necessitate theshortening of the line and  the abandonment of the population  to Bolshevik vengeance.       [5 94]                                                             B 2
 If the. Bolsheviks succeeded in capturing Archangel as the result of the withdrawal a disastrous effect on the feeling towards the allies would result.      In view of these considerations the  provisional  government considers  it absolutely necessary that  the British volunteer  brigades, the  French contingents, and  a  certain number of war vessels should remain  here, and it trusts that the question may be re-examined.   It does not  ask  that  troops  should  be employed  in the firing line, but to safeguard the line of communication, &amp;c.      I am replying  that though I am forwarding  this communication to you I have every reason to believe the decision  to  evacuate all the allied forces  before the port closes is final.                                     POLAND.      British Help for  the  reorganizing of  the Police Force. On the  6th August Sir Percy Wyndham reported [No. 163] that Mr. Paderewski had spoken to him that day  of the police force  and had said  that  he would be grateful for  British help in reorganizing it.   Sir Percy said that  he had  suggested  that,  should Lord Curzon&apos; approve,  Colonel Macready might be  asked whether he would  allow himself  to be attached  to the ministry of the interior.    Mr.  Paderewski had  then  asked that the rest  of the mission  should  consist of one or two instructors who should  organize the service, and one or two others who  should travel  and report.      Poles and  Bolsheviks :  capture of Minsk and Stuck. The  following  communique was issued by the War Office on 12th August :       For the past fortnight the Poles  have been  advancing slowly but steadily towards Minsk, against  strong Bolshevik resistance.  The Bolsheviks, faced with a converging hostile movement  from the direction of Lida, to the west of the city,  and Vileika, on the north of it, in the course of the last  fortnight  delivered  heavy counter-attacks in both directions with the object of checking or breaking  the jaws of the pincers closing in on them.  That against the northern claw, delivered oh July 30, made some progress on the extreme  Polish left and captured  Byeloruch,  12 miles north of the city, but was eventually held up, subjected to  violent  blows, and driven headlong  from all its gains with serious losses.   On the same day the second counter-attack of  the Bolsheviks to the west, delivered on a broad front of 20 miles  from the  Swislocz  river at Zaslaw&apos; by Rakow to Wolma, was  everywhere  beaten off except  at  Bakow ;  this village  fell temporarily into Bed hands, but was retaken later by the Poles.     The counter-offensive on both flanks having  proved  a costly failure, the Bolsheviks resigned themselves to the evacuation of the city, which was entered by the victorious Poles on Friday last, August 8.     Minsk is the capital of a government, and had  in the last  census  a population of 91,000 ; it contains several large tobacco and match factories and  ironworks, tanneries, and breweries.   The  railway from  Kharkoff to Libau and the Baltic here crosses  the great international trunk line from Warsaw to Moscow.  The city  was first founded in the  thirteenth  century, and has belonged at various  times to Lithuania,  Poland, and Russia, but was finally annexed, by the last at  the second partition of Poland in  1793.     The Polish  offensive north of the Pinsk marsh belt is likewise going, forward well. The retirement from Minsk and the, Polish advance  along the  Luninetz-Mozye railway has left a large pocket of Bolsheviks,  50  miles  wide, in the-Mir-Koidan area;  the Polish efforts are apparently now being directed to pinching out this pocket by sustained blows from the south.  According to latest reports,  Siniawka,  10  miles  north, and Nesyij, 18 miles south-east of Mir, the extreme western extremity of the pocket, were taken on the 8th, while Sluck, 38 miles to the east at the opposite end,  fell into Polishhands on the 9th.  The situation of the Bolsheviks in  this sector is therefore becoming difficult, and there is no doubt that their whole position  on the Western Bussian front must at present give  them cause  for considerable anxiety.     The Jews.- On the 9th August Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 200]to Sir Percy Wyndham :      As the Polish government is doubtless  aware,  complaints continue to be receivedfrom  Jewish societies throughout  the world as  to the  condition of their co-religionistsin Poland.     His majesby&apos;s government feels  that  it as  much in the interest of  the Polishgovernment as  in that of the other governments concerned for  the welfare of Poland
that some steps should be taken to allay the apprehensions of the Jewish  communities and to meet the charges which are being made.     In these circumstances they  have  thought that the wisest course would be to despatch an independent mission to Poland, entrusted with the task of seeing for itself the relations existing between the Polish and Jewish populations.     I presume the Polish government will not raise any objection, and will be preparedto afford  the members of  the  mission  the same facilities which they are affording toMr. Morgenthau&apos;s mission.                                    TURKEY.ASIA MINOR.     Turkish feeling. On  the 9th August Admiral Webb reported  [No.  1637] from constantinople as follows :      The conspicuous feature of the  numerous appeals which are  reaching me from various Turkish quarters is apprehension,  realized  or pretended, of the forward actionon the part of Armenians now,.and of Moslem majorities being placed under Armenianrule later.     The decision in regard to the  delimitation of the  zones  of  occupation  in the smyrna district  must to some extent, take the wind out of agitators in the interior.You  doubtless,  however, appreciate  the fact that  the agitators have  long got pastconcern for Smyrna alone.   They may therefore be expected now  to work the Armenianbogey for all it is worth.   Troubles reported from  across the frontier of the Armenianrepublic and suspicions  engendered by  the  enraged Armenian  mission now here willmake this all the easier.     Briefly, agitators will  make propaganda on the following lines :-     The Entente powers are merciless and  anti-Moslem,  Their one  idea is to benefitArmenians who are guilty of worse atrocities  than the Turks ever  committed.   TheirPresident Wilsoifs proposals are moonshine where Moslems are  concerned.  You haveproof of this in Smyrna  where Turkey was caught  napping ;  do not be caught nappingin the eastern vilayets.                                AFGHANISTAN.     The Peace  Treaty. The following is the text (as telegraphed by Reuter) of thetreaty of peace signed on the 8th August :      Article 1.  From  the date of signing  this treaty peace  is declared between  theBritish  and Afghanistan governments.     Article 2.  In view of the circumstances which have brought on the present war, theBritish  government as a mark of  displeasure withdraws the privilege enjoyed  by theformer amirs of importing arms and ammunition or warlike munitions through India.     Article 3.  The arrears of the late amir&apos;s  subsidy are furthermore confiscated andalso no  subsidy is to be granted to the present amir.    Article 4.  At the same time the British government is desirous  of the re-establish-ment of the  old friendship thac  has so long  existed  between  Great  Britain  and afghanistan, provided  that they  have guarantees  that the Afghan  government  issincerely  anxious to regain our  friendship.   The  British  government is  prepared,provided the Afghans prove their  sincerity by acts and  conduct, to receive anotherAfghan mission after six months for the discussion and settlement of matters of common interest to the  two governments and  the re-establishment of the old friendship on asatisfactory basis.    The Afghan  government  accepts the Indo-Afghan frontier accepted by the lateamir.   They  further agree to the early demarcation  by a British  commission  of theundemarcated portion of the West Khyber  where the Afghan  aggression happened, andwill accept such boundary as the British commission lays down.  The British troops onthis side of the border will  remain in  their present positions until the new demarcationhas been effected.    The Boundary Commission. On the 9th August Reuters  Simla  agent reportedthat Mr. Maffey&apos;, private  secretary to the viceroy, had  been appointed  head  of theAfghan boundary commission, which would fix the frontier  from Sisobi to Palosi, onthe Kabul river.   The commission would start out shortly with a strong escort to  erectpillars marking the boundary.   An Afghan  officer would be  permitted  to watch theproceedings.
     Tribal  Feuds. -Telegraphing  from Simla  on the  8th August  Reuter&apos;s  agernT.reported as follows: Bitter feeling against the Afghans is evinced by Hazara prisonersof war, and deserters in our hands  on account of riots which  broke out between thefollowers of the shiah and sunni sects in Kandahar, which resulted in the deaths of a&quot;large number of shiahs of both sexes.                                    PERSIA;     Visit of the Shah to Europe. On the  11th August Sir  Percy Cox reported[No. 536] that, as then arranged, the Shah would leave Teheran  for Europe  on thefollowing day.o
