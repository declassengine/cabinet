On  the  24th December Mr.  Clive reported[No. 3759] that he had received the  following letter from M.  Litvinoff and that theFrench, American, and Italian ministers had received similar ones :     The sixth All-Russian congress of Soviets  of  November last, reflecting the sinceredesire of the Russian toiling masses to live in undisturbed peace and friendship with allthe peoples of the world, addressed to the Governments of the allied countries a formaloffer of peace.   This offer  was  repeated by  the Soviet  Government  by wireless a fewdays  ago.   I have now to  inform  you that I have  been authorised  to enter onpreliminary peace negotiations with  representatives of the allied countries, should their governments reciprocate the desire of the  Russian republic for a peaceful settlement ofall  outstanding  questions which may  give  rise  to  hostilities between  the countries concerned.   I shall be glad if you will kindly bring the  above declaration to the notice ofyour Government at your very earliest convenience.     On the 29th December Mr. Clive reported [No. 3780] that M. Litvinoff had given an interview to a Swedish paper, in&apos; which he had published the text of his note to  theallied representatives.   When asked if he expected an answer,  he replied; &quot; There isno good having too great  hopes about this, but  now  that we have shown to the world.our willingness for peace, the  responsibility for continued  war  and bloodshed rests onthe Entente.&quot;SIBERIA.     General Situation in  Vladivostock, On the 27th December Mr. Alston reported[No. 370] on the situation as follows : General Horvat  is installed  at Vladivostock,.where       [756]                                                          &apos;       B
he arrived on the day the British  troops disembarked, and is surrounded  by a gang ofsatellites, some of whom were notorious even in the old days.  The wealthy class, higherofficials, and merchants, who believed that his arrival meant the salvation of Russia, andwould in any case assure their positions, are already disappointed and disillusioned-they see that his regime in the Far East was still-born.                                 - .     Admiral Koltchak is but little known, and  is distrusted  by the  masses, m spite ofhis real qualities, and is believed to have assumed his  position by the advice of, and tobe maintaining  his  position with the  support of,  ourselves and  the  French:   bisassumption of control of the army does not appeal to the military element on account ofthe rivalry which has always existed between the navy  and the army.   The  assumedsupport by ourselves of Admiral  Koltchak and  the consequent reaction is getting usdisliked by  the  workmen and by the  socialist elements  who believe that the BritishGovernment in thus acting is in opposition to the wishes of British labour.     The working classes saw the bright side of  Bolshevism and that alone enormouswages, a  minimum of work, a timorous  and cowed bourgeoise, and complete freedom from  the  tyranny of officialdom.  The  Czechs robbed them of their  ideal,  and theallies seem to be  taking them back to the detested bureaucratic regime.     Those belonging to the  petite bourgeoisie (tradesmen, small  employees, &amp;c.) have maintained their  socialistic leanings.  Only by much persuasion were they brought tosupport the allied demand for help against the Bolsheviks, and they consider that  theyhave  been trapped.   They  sympathise  with the  Czechs,   recognising  them to  bedemocrats and opponents of reaction ; whilst the allies  are permitting the establishmentof reaction and have no counterbalancing good to their  credit.  They find that  everyavailable  building  is filled to overflowing;  that rents are from ten to twenty timesgreater than their normal amount;  that the price of living is rising by leaps and bounds ;and that the railway is almost at a standstill.     Latterly more  and more space had  been devoted  in the press to  the subject of intervention.  The  socialist press took every opportunity of emphasising differences ofopinion between  the allies,  particularly differences  between England,  France, and america on points to be dealt with  by the peace  conference.   On  the other hand the papers, which were  frankly pro-ally, are beginning to assume a questioning attitude.     The general  trend of the press  may be summed up as follows :  We do not know the intentions of the allies in regard to  Russia :  if they know themselves let them make a clear statement on the subject, we are tired of their indefinite policy.  If a statement isnot made, and  we  come to the conclusion that the allies are acting solely in their own interests (the cessation of war having abolished the need  of an anti-German front) theymust not blame us.    The  press also says that during  the  war  the  allies declared  that they  fullysubscribed Mr.  Wilson&apos;s fourteen points : but now that the war is over, their point ofview has been modified, and they show imperialistic tendencies, whence it is clear thatthey are not  to be fully trusted.    The  Japanese. On the  28th December  Sir  Conyngham  Greene  transmitted[No. 1249] a  telegram from the military attache reporting that at an interview with the acting chief of the intelligence buieau, the  latter had said that they were doing their utmost to promote good relations between Semenov, Horvat,  and  Koltchak, and therewas  a good  prospect of success.  They  had, he  said, long since  ordered  the officer in command  of the  Japanese troops to keep Semenov in  check, and it was  in consequenceof their action that  he  had  not made a declaration  of independence;  but they were reluctant to discard him as, from  the beginning,  he had supported  the interests of theallies by fighting  the Bolsheviks.   Koltchak, he added, had been rendered  powerless todo harm.     The acting-chief further said  that they had decided  to withdraw 31,000 of their troopsduring  January; their primary  object, that of saving  the  Czechs, had  been accom-plished.   This,  he urged, showed that Japan had no ulterior designs upon the integrity of Siberia.     Esthonians in Siberia.- On  the 30th December Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 382]a  message from  the  consul  at Irkutsk, who reported that he had  been informed thatthere were 200,000  Esthonians in Siberia  anxious to help against the Bolsheviks.  they wanted to enrol  a  regiment of their own, but Admiral Koltchak refused to allow this,giving as  his reason the fact that Esthonian  independence  had not been recognised  by russia.
 GEORGIA.     Representatives for the Peace  Conference-Mr,  Balfour informed Admiral Webb on the 28th  December [No. 222] that he might grant facilitiesrto the Georgian repre- sentatives to proceed to France, but he should make it clear that their reception in that country was a matter for the French Government.  The  British Government viewed the erection  of  the  new republic with  sympathy,  and was  prepared  to urge  its recognition at the conference, and it was willing to ask that  its representatives should be  given  a hearing ;   but the conference alone could decide who should take part and what degree of recognition should be accorded to representatives of new states.                                     POLAND.     The Galician Jews. Lord Kilmarnock reported on the  28th December [No. 3946]. that  the Zionist  Bureau in Copenhagen had requested him to inform His  Majesty&apos;s Government of the constitution at  Lemberg of the Jewish  national council for  eastern Galicia, as  the only  body representing the  800,000 Jews &quot; who, as a consequence of civil war, had been deprived.of their political freedom and lived under heavy  oppression and in constant danger.&quot;                                   RUMANIA.     Bessarabia. On  the 24th December  Lord  Derby transmitted [No.  1860] the following translation   of a telegram sent by  the  allied ministers at Bucharest : The Bessarabian assembly,  which on the  27th  March last  voted  union with Rumania on condition of a large measure of autonomy, has now  voted  union without conditions. This vote has been prompted by that of other  provinces which  have united themselves to  Rumania, and by  the  conviction that in a greater  Rumania a  purely democratic regime will prevail in future.                                    TURKEY.     Request for a Loan. Admiral  Webb reported on  the  28th December [No. 260] that the Qttoman Government had  approached the French high commissioner on the question of a  loan.  It seemed  fairly clear that  the  Ottoman Government  had  only enough money to last them, at the outside, till the end of  February ; and that money was paper.  His French  colleague attached the  greatest  importance to the matter on account of the immense French interests in Turkey.                                     EGYPT.     Resignation of the Rushdi Cabinet. On the 23,rd  December Sir  Reginald Wingate reported [No. 1928]  that he had  been  assured   by  Sirry  Pasha,  who  was next  in seniority to the president of the  council, that if Rushdi Pasha and Adly Pasha  were allowed to go to London at an early date and to get into touch wdth  the Foreign Office, they would be ready to  proceed thither in their official  capacity.   Sirry Pasha had appealed to him to  recommend  His Majesty&apos;s  Government to  treat the crisis  in a manner which would permit the ministers who had resigned to keep  their  posts.     Telegraphing again on the 26th  December, Sir Reginald said that Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 23rd  December  [E.R. No. C, p.  2],  having crossed his  of  that date, he  should  await  further instructions before  taking action.  He had received another visit from Sirry Pasha who expressed  his conviction that,  if  they could find some way of saving their face, the ministers  would like to  draw back as they were  gradually realizing that they had gone too far.   But he thought that this could only be achieved by some concession which would let them go to England without much delay.                                   ABYSSINIA.     Message for the King from the  Empress. On the  1.9th December Mr.  Campbell transmitted [No. 115] a message sent by  the Prince Regent, Ras Taffari, on behalf of the Empress Zauditu, congratulating His Majesty the King on the allied  victory, to celebrate  which thanksgiving  services  would be held  in the  churches  of  Abyssinia. The message  concluded with the statement  that the  Abyssinian  Government, being desirous of entering into  closer relations  with other  countries  and especially with  its neighbours, intended  shortly to send a special mission  to Europe which, it  hoped, would be  favourably received by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     In  reply  to  this,  on  the 29th  December [No. 63] Mr.  Balfour  instructed Mr. Campbell to give the following message from the King; to Ras Taffari :-     Please express to Her Majesty the Empress my  sincere thanks for her message of       [756]                &apos;                                           B 2
                                         Acongratulation.  I  learn with  satisfaction that your  Church  and  people  are  unitedwith my  own  in offering thanksgivings for the success of the allies, and I shall havepleasure  in  receiving Her  Majesty&apos;s  representatives  with the  consideration due to a friendly Government.                                    CILICIA.    Adana. On the 29th  December General Clayton transmitted [No. 254] a telegramfrom Sir Mark Sykes [No. 54],, who reported as follows : I have visited Adana, and my visit confirms me in my views as expressed in appreciation of the situation at Aintab-[E.R. No. C, p. 3].   So far as I could see, outwardly the demobilisation had been carriedout scrupulously, but actually it had been circumvented by increasing the gendarmeriebeyond  all necessary requirements ; by incorporating self-demobilised men ;  by issuingsurplus rifles to villagers, nominally for self-defence against imaginary enemies; and by putting all  legitimate delays  in  the  way of providing railway fuel for the  Entente.Turkish officials and agents do everything possible to increase the apprehension and  toplay on the fears of the Moslem  population.   It is reported that Nihid Pasha is to  beappointed governor  of the A.dana province.   I submit  most strongly that such  an appointment would  be most dangerous.  Nihid is obviously implicated in  the C.U.P.and schemes to create trouble, in Cilicia, and if he returns will only do so to further the C.U.P.  policy.   M. Picot  concurs in the above.    We both strongly urge that ifNihid is proposed as governor, that his  appointment should be instantly vetoed.                                   ARMENIA.    Armenians and Kurds. On the  30th  December General Clayton  transmitted[No. 255j a message [No. 57] from Sir Mark Sykes, who reported  that a deputation of six  Kurdish and Arab shaykhs from the  district between Membij, Rakka, Meskene,(?) Harran,  and (?)  Seruj had communicated  a  note  signed by  them, of which thefollowing is  a summary :     We have in our villages and tents 650 Armenians, mostly women and children,.andour friendly neighbours have 800 more.   We wish to hand over these 650 Armenians tothe European Powers who  are helping   the Armenians, and  we believe this is also the wish of our friendly neighbours.    If the allied Powers will send officers to our district,we wish to co-operate with them in collecting  these Armenians, and we are sure ourfriendly neighbours  will, also help.   We  must, however, state that this can only be doneon the condition that the Turks leave our district  and  European governors  take their place, because  we know     1. The  Turks wish to destroy the Armenians.    2. The  Turks wish to put the responsibility on us and to make  enmity between us and the Armenians, and if they remain  with  gendarmes and governors they can do asthey have done before.  We write this  because the Armenians, hearing of the end  ofthe war, are leaving our tents to seek their homes and are in danger by the roadside ;we believe that the Turks may destroy those who  are returning as they destroyed thosewho came.   We have fed these people for four years, and  do not wish to see the breadwe have given them wasted.  We  also know of 800 [? 600] more Armenians in the tentsof the tribes friendly to us, but too far east to  allow us to speak for them ; but we aresure that if the [? Europeans] send officers to those tribes  they will  find that the same conditions may be fulfilled with regard to those Armenians as with ours.    In regard to the above, Sir Mark continues,  I examined the signatories and  amcertain the figures are a conservative estimate, and  1 believe that the case  is true.   Inany  event,  I  believe this offers a grand opportunity to collect  a large  number  ofArmenians in good health, and of  starting good relations  between the Armenians andthe Kurds.  The reason why  the shaykhs stipulate  for  the removal  of the turkish authorities is explained by  the fact that nearly  every Kurdish  chief who protectedArmenians in pre-war days  was sooner or later removed by the Turks or died a violentdeath.   If  the matter is not  taken in  hand soon, these Armenians will disperse andrun great  risks.  I am strongly of opinion that the signatories are right in thinking that the Turks can foil or confuse whatever may be undertaken so long as  they remainin control of the  area.  If the Government  approves, it should not  be  difficult  toarrange a scheme  of concentration  and removal by stages,  provided the Turkishkaimakams  and mudirs are replaced by European political  officers  accompanied  byinterpreters.    The origin of the note  was that about  ten days ago I told a shaykhfrom that area that the allies would approve of those tribes who helped the Armenians.The case is pressing as the  Turks are active in the district mentioned, and the signa-tories are waiting in Aleppo for a reply.
                                     SYRIA.     Further- Activities of M.  Picot. On. the  30th December General Clayton tele-graphed  [No. 258] in  regard  to the proposed  despatch  of a. deputation  from the lebanon to the peace  conference.   General Clayton said that the permits to embark atBeirut had  not been  issued on British forms, but were in  the nature of a safe-conductgranted by M. Picot in  his capacity of high commissioner of the  French republic in syria and Armenia.   M. Picot, chief political, adviser to the commander-in-chief, hadnot  reported what he  had done ;  and  his grant was irregular as he had no executive authority under the Commander-in-chief to issue  such permits, which were only grantedafter reference to G.H.Q. for approval.     General Clayton  pointed out that if this deputation were allowed to proceed, others which claimed a right  to submit their views to the peace conference could not be refused,and  the obvious result would be the formation of numerous rival deputations representingthe  conflicting  groups of  Syrian, Zionist, and Arab political opinion.   And a furtherresult would be polit ical agitation of a character to constitute a, grave  danger to lawand ordt-r, and to permanently prejudice the possible future  reconciliation of the differentexisting  parties.   General Clayton added that a similar  claim  had been disallowed  inEgypt, and  if Syrian  and  Arab deputations were allowed  to proceed to  Europe deepresentment would be  felt in that country.                                  PALESTINE.     Nablus and Hejaz. General  Clayton reported on the  27th  December [No. 251]that the movement in favour  of the King of Hejaz was gaining ground in the districtabout Nablus, but in  his opinion it was mainly due to fear  of a Jewish supremacy, andwas  not deep seated.                                                           -     Relief  of  Distress at Haifa. In  his  telegram  of  the 27th  December, GeneralClayton also reported that over 500Z.  had been collected for the relief of the destitute of Haifa.                                     ARABIA.     King Hussein and Ibn  Saud. On  the 27th December  Sir Reginald Wingatetelegraphed  [No.  1958] his  conclusions  in regard to the  dispute between the King ofHejaz and Ibn Saud,  conclusions reached  after a perusal  of Mr.  Philby&apos;s report  on theNejd mission and of  an account  of  the  recent lengthy discussions between  ColonelWdson and King Hussein on the same subject.   He,  Sir Reginald,  had, too, discussed the Khurma question with Mr. Philby.     The aims  of King Hussein   and Ibn  Saud were  incompatible :  the  former wasendeavouring to  obtain a  nominal hegemony over a loose system of autonomous arab states, the latter,  relying on his treaty with us,  was working to recover the empire ofthe  former  Wahabite empire.   Sir  Reginald  thought  that, judged by Europeanstandards,  the balance of evidence  was in favour of the  Hejaz claim.    Ibn  Saud,however, was in possession of Khurma, sectarian sentiment was inflamed, and a forcibleassertion of King HussehFs claim, which we had never disputed, might bring  about ageneral conflagration.     The intended concentration of the King&apos;s levies to operate against the Ikhwan atKhurma had been delayed by the  rupture of the armistice  consequent on Fakhrfsrefusal  to  surrender Medina.  King  Hussein affirmed  that  the  spread  of  Ikhwaninfluences would be facilitated  by a prolongation of the status quo,  and might render hisposition  untenable ; this, Sir Reginald Wingate  said, might  make it necessary for  usto prevent a Wahabite occupation of Mecca by sending regular  Moslem troops.     If, as he gathered, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that it could not compel the  withdrawal of Ibn Saud from Khurma, he would try to persuade the King to accepta line running approximately from  Quraba to Marran as  a  provisional boundary--;  butthere was little  chance of his accepting it ; indeed, Colonel Wilson  believed  that  itwould lead to his immediate abdication, as he would interpret it as  a refusal to entertainhis political projects.     Medina.- Sir Reginald Wingate reported on the 30th December  [No. 1985] thatFakhri  still refused  to surrender.  He  told the  Turkish envoy that  the  order  was addressed to the officer commanding the  Hejaz force, but  as guardian  of  the  tomb  ofMahomet he could only be relieved from  bis dut3^ by the Sultan.   The envoy thoughtthat he would withdraw into tbeHaram wdth what survived of his  force  ; the Haram, he
 said, was already not only munitioned  but provisioned,  he believed, for six months, though money, forage, and food supplies  were very low in the city.     Subsidies. Sir Reginald Wingate reported on the 18th December [No. 1903] that on the 22nd November Colonel Wilson had had  a conversation  with  King Hussein  in regard to the subsidy which would be&apos;required by the latter after the war.  The  King^ estimated that 120:000L.would be required monthly to meet the deficit in the Hejaz budget,  and  undertook to submit  a detailed  estimate of anticipated receipts and disbursements.  He recognised that so soon as conditions were normal, there must, be a - suspension of the subsidies granted to tribesmen,  other than grants  for the protection of the railway and pilgrimages, which should be made on the Turkish scale.     A  Hejaz War  Medal. Sir  Reginald Wingate reported on  the 29 th December INo. 1968] that General  Allenby  had recommended  that a war medal or badge should be issued by King Hussein to all the troops who had  taken part in the campaign  in Arabia, Palestine, and Syria since the date when his forces had joined with them against the Turks.  The cost of this could not be defrayed by Hejaz. YEMEN.     Separate  Nationalist Movement. On the  23rd  December Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1556] to Sir Reginald Wingate calling  his attention  to the  fact that information received from  reliable sources pointed  to  the existence of a separate Arab  nationalist movement in Yemen.  This information seemed to indicate that the Imam was contera- plating the setting up of an independent  Arab state, and was persuading  Arab officers and officials who till recently had been in the Turkish administration  to join  him. Mr. Balfour suggested that ignorance  of the  main Arab  movement  and of our close connexion with it might in some measure account for the Imanfs action..     Sir Reginald Wingate, replying  to  this  on the 30th December [No. 1982], said that it was reported from Aden that they had a good deal of evidence that the a;m  of the Imam had been the absolute and independent control of Yemen.   Mahmud  Nadim, the governor,  had given him his support, and  so  to  some extent had the corps com- mander,  Tewfik  Pasha.   Since our occupation of Hodiedah, the Imam had apparently been more amenable, but doubtless he wanted all that he could  get; and, tnough he might accept  his money, he did  not  contemplate any real sovereignty of the King of Hejaz over Yemen.     Attack  on Hodeida. On the 30th  December  Mr.  Balfour  informed  [No.  230] Admiral Calthorpe that the Turks had attacked the British force in Hodeida  on the 17th December; and there were  good reasons for  believing that the attacking force had come from Bjil  and  Manakha. Admiral  Calthorpe was instructed to inform the Turkish Government of this attack and to  say that more drastic measures would be resorted  to in  Constantinople unless energetic steps  svere taken to prevent any further breach of the armistice.                                    PERSIA.     The Shah and  the  Cabinet. On the  26th December Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed [No.  662j  to  Sir  Percy  Cox,  in  reply  to his telegram of  the 21 th December [E.R. No. C, p. 3],  saying that he was  at one with  Sir Percy  in  thinking  that,  in present circumstances, it would  not  be desirable  for the  Persian  cabinet to resign. Unless, therefore, he should see any objection to so doing,  Sir Percy should inform the Shah at once that unless he co-operated wholeheartedly with  the prime  minister no- further instalment of the subvention would be paid.     The Cossack Division. On the 2Sth  December Sir  Percy Cox  asked permission-[No.  1085j to  inform Colonel Starosselski, when  necessary, that we proposed to pay the monthly subvention  of the Cossack division no longer direct, but through the minister of war, so long as a  cabinet was in power which had our approval and support.   His reason for the suggested change was that he thought that payment through the cabinet would make Col mel Starosselski more disposed to support it.     On the 30th December Mr. Balfour [No. 671J authorised Sir Percy Cox to act as he had suggested ;  but, as it might later  on  be advisable to  discontinue payment through the Government, he  was instructed to say when making the  communication  that  it would be done &quot; for  the present.&quot;
