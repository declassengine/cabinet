Peace Negotiations with Esthonia.  Russianaccount of the peace negotiations with Esthonia :-wireless  reports give  the following     Moscow, September 17.-      A message from Moscow, addressed to the &quot; Chicago Daily News &quot; Bureau, statesthat  the  delegates appointed  by  the Russian  Soviet  Government  for the  peacenegotiations  with  the Esthonians  at  Pskoff are : Leonid Krasin, Commissary for trade and Communications ; Maxim Litvinoff,  former Soviet envoy  to Great Britain ;and  Professor Bogolyepoff.  Litvinoff declared that the Russian Soviet Governmentwas  always ready to conclude peace with the neighbouring nations on the basis of self-determination.  These nations  were  waging  war against Russia under  pressure  fromthe Entente.   The  Esthonian Government, probably acting under British influence, had asked the Russian  Soviet Government to postpone the conference for several clays, butthe latter were determined not to furnish them with any pretext  for suspending thenegotiations.     Moscow,  September 18 (sic).      On  the  16th  September the Esthonian  Peace  Delegation arrived  in Pskoff.  Itconsists of five representatives.     A meeting has already taken  place  between our delegates and  the Esthoniandelegates for the purpose of drawing up rules and regulations.   The  first official meetingwill  take  place on the 17th September.     Moscow,  September 17.      To-night at 7 o&apos;clock the  evening session of the  Peace Conference was opened.The  Esthonian  delegates  announced that they had not had  time to receive necessary instructions from their Government,  and therefore asked for the session to be postponedtill the following morning.  In reply to Comrade  Krasbfs question, the President ofthe Esthonian Delegation stated that the Esthonian Delegation would make a reply onthe following  morning.  At Comrade LitvinofFs  suggestion  the Conference adjourned.
     Moscow, September 18.      The President of the Esthonian Peace Delegation  at  the morning&apos;s session of theConference proposed  to adjourn  negotiations  until replies  were . received &apos; from: theGovernments  of  Finland,  Latvia, and Lithuania  to  the peace proposals.   Krasinsuggested that technical negotiations would be  conducted separately  by each party,&quot;but,&quot; said Krasin, &quot;we  shall raise  no objection  to  the Conference being general.&quot;According  to the statement  made by Birk, the head of the  Esthonian  Delegation,negotiations with regards to some questions would be conducted by each side separately ;there were some questions,  however, which would have to be-decided  by means of joint discussions.   Further,  Birk stated  that  to  wait in &quot;Pskoff  for replies from Finland,Latvia, and Lithuania was a waste of time, and proposed that a place and the time  ofrenewing  negotiations should be  settled at once, and also  asked whether the SovietGovernment agreed to carry on joint negotiations.  Krasin replied as follows :  &quot; again and again we have announced that we are ready to carry on negotiations with thewhole world if it should be necessary.&quot;  In reply to the question as to what matters theEsthonian  Delegation considered  necessary to discuss  at a  joint session,  Birk  said,&quot; The question of an armistice.&quot;   Litvinoff asked whether the Esthonian  Delegationwould agree to enter into separate  negotiations, should there be no reply from the  otherGovernments.  To this question the Esthonian Delegation did not  give a clear reply.&quot;We have observed,&quot; said  Krasin, &quot; that your demands for joint negotiations were notcontained in the reply of the Esthonian Government.  We regret that so  much time should have been wasted over preliminaries.  Negotiations have come to an end throughno fault of ours.&quot;  According  to Birk, the consent of the  Soviet  Government  to  carryon joint negotiations is a matter of utmost importance.     In  reply  to  Krasin&apos;s  question whether other demands  would  be made, such  assimultaneous negotiations  with  Allied  countries and hostile  Russian organisations, onresumption  of negotiations,  Birk  replied that  the  Reval Government  would  make no such demands.  At 7 P.M. the protocol of the meeting was  copied and the EsthonianDelegations once more left for the front, with cries :  &quot; We shall  soon meet  again.&quot;Soon after the Russian Delegation left Pskoff.     Before the  closing of the Conference,  the Russian Delegation,  having heard thedeclaration  of the  Esthonian Delegation, stated the  following:  &quot;When  the  RevalGovernment agreed to enter into negotiations with the Russian Socialist Federal soviet republic it did not make the  participation of other  Powers in those negotiations acondition.  The refusal of the Esthonian Delegation to discuss peace terms until a  reply should be received from the  neighbouring  States, means  that the Reval Governmentdenies its first consent to enter into separate negotiations with the Government of theRussian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic.  The fulfilling of this new condition depends on a third  party, and the  Russian Soviet Government  therefore  refuses  to  accept any responsibility before the proletariat of Russia and Esthonia for the  cessation  of  peacenegotiations, and for the continuation of warfare between the  two countries.     &quot; The Esthonian  Delegation  refused the  offers of an armistice, proposed by the delegation of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, in order to avoid uselessbloodshed.   The Delegation of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic once moreconfirms its readiness to renew peace negotiations separately with the Reval Government,or simultaneously with other Governments.&quot;     [It is not clear at present whether  negotiations  have been interrupted or definitelybroken off.]     According to a German wireless report from Nauen (21st September),  the  baltic states demand :      1. That the political frontier between Russia and the  Baltic States should be  fixed           on the basis of ethnographical boundaries ;     2. That a neutral zone should be established, within which  Soviet Russia should           not be allowed  to maintain an army;     3. That order should be maintained within this zone by a neutral Power ;     4. That Russia should hand over her war fleet to a neutral Power.              &apos;     Feeling against Bolshevism. Sir C.  Kennard (Helsingfors) learns from a reliable source.the views expressed by the  Communist Kusinen, who has recently  returned fromPetrograd, to a Bolshevik sympathiser.   Kusinen states that  the  position in Petrogradis much worse than in  Moscow.   In Siberia, peasants, workmen,  and bourgeois  object
strongly to the arbitrary acts of individual commissaries, but support Bolshevism in preference to any other authority which they suspect of reactionary tendencies.  If theblockade of Bussia was raised he is of opinion that some other system would supplantthe Bolshevik regime.     Evacuation  of   the   Caspian. According  to  the  Admiralty  weekly  report(G.T.-8172) issued on  the 13 th September, the  British evacuation of the Caspian was completed by the 6th  September.     Memorandum  on  a Russian Policy.-Attention  is  drawn  to a  Memorandum[G.T.-8201] written by the  Secretary of State for War on the situation in  Russia  as affecting British policy. . The Memorandum first describes the &quot; hopeful though critical &quot;situation on the anti-Bolshevik fronts.  Admiral Kolchak&apos;s southern army has sustaineda severe defeat, but further north his resumption of the offensive has  been not  unsuc-cessful and  may lead  to important results.  In the south, as  a  result of  his victories,General Denikin now  controls regions containing 30,000,000 inhabitants [see also G.T.-8200] and  a network of railways, and readily accessible to British  and French trade.Moreover,  his  army numbers over 300,000  fighting men, is  daily increasing,  and  iscommanded by the best Russian  generals.  To desert him  at  this juncture, even if hedefeated the Bolsheviks without  Allied help,  would be &quot; to make certain that, whateverelse  may be the outcome, we have a hostile Russia to face.&quot;  It is urged most strongly,therefore, that our policy should  be continued with a view to completing &quot; the despatchof munitions, helping him in his difficulties with  other anti-Bolshevik  forces, guidinghim  as far  as possible with political counsel, and preventing him from falling into thehands  of reactionaries.....Countenance, counsel, and commerce these are themeans which are alone demanded.&quot;     The  Memorandum goes on to  point out that the issue between Denikin andPetlura is that of a united Russia versus an independent Ukraine.   &quot;The duty of theAllies  should  be  to  try to reconcile the two conflicting  points of view.....the conception of a Russia  consisting  of a number of autonomous States, grouped together on a federal basis into  a Russian  union,  is one  within which all  legitimate aspirationsmay be comprised.&quot;     Adverting to Poland, the Memorandum states the Polish suggestion for an advance on a large scale into Russia  would rouse  Russian nationalism, while, on the other hand,a premature peace would release  a large Bolshevik army for other fronts.   &quot; It  seems,therefore, clear that our policy at the present moment should  be to persuade the Polesto carry on for a  few months as  they  are  doing, i.e., fighting  and  defeating theBolsheviks on their borders where and when they can, without preparing either for  a decisive advance into the heart of Russia or for a separate peace.&quot;     A similar policy is advised for the Baltic States.  The situation is here complicated by the presence of von der Goltz&apos;s army, which shows itself disposed to give substantialaid to the National Russian forces.   In view  of the seeming difficulty both of the Alliesand the German Government to deal  with von der Goltz&apos;s troops, it  is suggested &apos;&quot;&apos; thatthe Germans, and German influence generally in this region, in so  far  as  it  cannot  be eliminated,  should be  controlled and made  to serve a useful purpose. ....  It ispossible that means may be  found not only to make the Germans withdraw their mainstrength from these regions, but  at the same  time to preserve those units formed by  theGermans which can be made use of against the Bolsheviks.&quot;  For this purpose theyshould be invited to attend  an international commission, which should be instituted to conduct, affairs in the Baltic States.   The danger is pointed out of  using Polish troopsagainst the recalcitrant as tending to  throw the National Russians into the arms of  theGermans and arouse the suspicions of the Latvians and  Lithuanians.     The Memorandum concludes : &quot; Generally  speaking,  it may be  said that thereare  two Russias and  two  Germanies a Bolshevik  and  an anti-Bolshevik  Russia,and  a  pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik Germany.    Both Germanies look  to  russians their only  means of regaining world power.  Each  keeps up its own  relationswith its counterpart in Russia.   Either  by the pro-Bolshevik or anti-Bolshevik roadGermany is determined to  get  hold  of Russia.  At present  profound  doubt exists asto which will be the  best  hand for  Germany  to hold  out,   and  which  will  be  thebest  hand  for  them to clasp in  Russia.   Up  to the present moment only  BolshevikRussia is ready to deal with either  section in Germany.  But the moment  the Alliesdefinitely take steps which  are  fundamentally injurious to anti-Bolshevik Russia, and make  it clear  that   they   do  not   care whether  it is crushed or not,  both  the       [954]   -                                                         B 2
Russian hands will be stretched out alternatively for Germany to clasp, and  in eitherone way or another these two mighty branches of the human race will come together ineffective action.&quot;                                    POLAND.    Agreement with Latvia. Colonel Tallents (Riga) learns that the Polish Governmenthas offered to enter into an agreement with Latvia on the following  conditions : (l) The Poles to take Dvinsk  and  hand it over to the Latvian Government ;  (2) theport of Riga and  the  railway  from Dvinsk to Warsaw to  be opened for the supplyof Poland.                                   LITHUANIA.    Recognition by Great Britain. Colonel Tallents has been instructed to inform theProvisional  Lithuanian Government  that  the  British  Government is  prepared torecognise  it as a de facto independent body with  the same  status as  Esthonia andLatvia (Foreign Office, 23rd September).    Polish  Relations. Colonel Tallents  reports  (21st  September) that fighting hasoccurred between Polish and  Lithuanian troops at Yilkomir.   He urges the necessity ofestablishing a joint conference between  the  Poles and Lithuanians for the purposeof adjusting outstanding difficulties.   The Lithuanians are not unwilling to join  a league of States, but repudiate any special connection with Poland.  The LithuanianGovernment is to be reconstructed.                                    GEOBGIA.    Friendliness to Great Britain. Mr. Wardrop reports that  he was present at theopening  of the second session of  the  Constituent  Assembly, at  which  enthusiasticdemonstrations occurred in favour of Great Britain.    German Designs. Mr. Wardrop states that vigorous action  on the part of GreatBritain can alone save Georgia from falling into the orbit of Germany.   The Germanswho have already recognised Georgian  independence are said to be endeavouring tosend an accredited diplomatic representative to that country.   The municipal authorities of Tiflis have also received numerous commercial offers from German firms.   Mr. Wardroj)urges that Great  Britain should at least give provisional recognition to the de  factoGovernments of Transcaucasia,  which he thinks would result  in a flow of British capitalinto the  country and lead to the  establishment of public order and the security of life and property.    Russian Officials  in  Batoum. The Georgian Government has presented  a note toMr. Wardrop complaining  that Bussian  officials in the  Province of  Batoum,  whopretend to carry out  the  instructions of the British Commandant, but  are  in realityacting in the interests of  General Denikin, are  threatening the Mussulman population and forcing them to pass resolutions  against the pro-Georgian action of the local Mejlis.                                 AZEBBAIJAN.    Political  Situation. Mr.  Wardrop  (Tiflis)  reports that  the  Prime  Minister,M. Ussubekov, resigned on  the 13th  September on the ground that he had not a working  majority in Parliament.   It  is thought that he  wishes to strengthen hisposition by ridding himself of  certain members of his  Government, and the crisis  is&quot;regarded  as a matter of party politics.     On the 15th September, which was  the anniversary of the entrance of turkish troops into Baku,  the press published leading  articles expressing  conciliatory and friendly  sentiments to all  races  and religions,  but demanding  the recognition of theindependence of the Republic of Azerbaijan.     Situation  at  Baku. According  to a  Soviet  wireless  report  from  Moscow(19th September), the White Guard paper, &quot; Priazovsky Krai,&quot; states that there is agreat  feeling  of  unrest in Baku.   An Armenian pogrom is expected.  The Socialistparty  has asked  the  Azerbaijan Government  what measures will be  taken  on tbewithdrawal of the Brittsh and in view of the growing danger from Denikin.
    The Baku papers write :  &quot; The situation on the  Stock Exchange is hopeless.  Notransactions  are being  carried  out.&quot;   By order  of the  Azerbaijan  authorities theLabour papers, &quot; Proletari&quot; and &quot; Golos Bednoti,&quot; have  been suspended  for Bolsheviktendencies.  In Baku the whole of the  Bolshevik  presidium of the Labour conference has been arrested ; the Caspian Squadron has &apos;been  given over to the Volunteer Army.Besides boats, the British Command has given the  Volunteer  Army artillery, stores,supplies of equipment for sailors and private steamers.    The  Council  of Congresses  of the oilfield  owners  has  drawn  up a scheme forexporting oil through Astrakhan to the  Volga Basin  as the only means  of sending theBaku oil to the Volga.  New conflicts are possible between the oilfield owners  and theGovernment.                                    TURKEY.    Nationalist Movement. Sir J. de Bobeck reports that,  in the opinion of the GrandVizier, a  crisis is at hand.  The Nationalist Party, which was organised by mustapha kemal after the occupation of Smyrna, may  be regarded as the  descendant of theCommittee of Union and Progress.  Starting at Erzeroum the  movement spread overthe vilayets of Angora  and  Sivas, and  now threatens Kastamuni,  Kharput, and,according  to latest  information,  Diarbekr.   It has  only been  checked in its progresssouthwards towards Aidin by the  British occupation of the Anatolian railway.     The  Nationalists, who are in touch with the  Ministry of War in Constantinople,are working for an  independent  republic of Anatolia.   It seems  very doubtful whetherthey  will  accept the peace terms or in any way countenance the actions of the present government.     This is borne out by the proclamation issued by the  Sivas Congress  to the effectthat  they, the  representatives of Asiatic as well  as  of European Turkey, have broken off all relations with the present  Turkish Government, which they allege is not lawfullyformed, which is trying to create  discord amongst various Moslem elements, which act inan arbitrary manner, and which has lost the confidence of the whole Turkish nation.     They state  that a  new Government  must  be formed which shall possess theconfidence of the nation.  They  guarantee public security, and state that they are onlyopposed to the  present Cabinet.     In order to avoid a  clash with the  Nationalists, General Milne  has withdrawn his troops from the Samsoun district, with  the result that there are  now no  British troopsin the interior except along the railway.     Sir J. de Robeck sums up the situation as  follows : &quot;It must be borne in mind that  this state  of affairs will  not be temporary  but will continue to exist so long asGreeks and Italians  are  permitted  to remain  in  possession of sections of Asia Minor,which so far as I can see can lead to nothing but unending strife.  In the eyes  of theTurks we are responsible  for the  situation ; for  they can  only admit  that they were defeated by us, and  they therefore regard chastisement or annexation at  the  hands ofthe Greeks and Italians, or even  the French, as our  doing.&quot;                                      SYRIA.     Anti-French Activity. Colonel Meinertzhagen telegraphs that immediately afterEmir  Feisafs departure for  Paris, as a result of the  unofficial announcement  in thepress  of  the Syrian settlement,  an  Arab Committee of National  Defence,  whoseconstitution is unauthorised, issued a proclamation  for  partial compulsory mobilisation.Measures  have  been taken by the British authorities to  prevent this decision  beingcarried into effect and to break up the Committee.     Colonel Meinertzhagen  is of opinion  that no  trouble  is  likely to occur  so long as british troops  remain in the country, but, in  the  event of  their  withdrawal, theextreme Arab  party, supported  by the army,  will  force  a conflict with France.   EmirFeisal will then  be  compelled to  conform to this  movement or abandon his position ofleadership.                                    ARABIA.     Colonel Jacob&apos;s Mission. Colonel  Jacobs Mission  is still detained  by the  QuhraSheikhs, who are quarrelling amongst  themselves  as  to the  terms to be offered as  acondition of fhe Mission&apos;s release.     The Imam has been  informed that he  will be  held responsible for  the  Mission&apos;s
     Captain Nasir-ed-Din, a member of the Mission, writes that, with the exception ofAbu Hadi,  the attitude  of the sheikhs  has been  uniformly unfriendly,  though it-changed for the  better  after  the  unsuccessful  attacks  upon  Hodeidah. (british resident, Aden, September 19.)                                    PERSIA.     Feeling against the Agreement. Sir P. Cox telegraphs that  the carrying out ofthe  Agreement is still  awaited  with impatience  in  the provinces.   Meanwhile inTeheran the French and  American Legations are showing continued opposition to it.The hostile  arguments generally used are that the Agreement is incompatible with theprinciples of the League of Nations, and  that  it makes Persia ineligible for membership of the League as being under British protection.     A report from Meshed states that a large meeting has been held under Bolshevikauspices at  Askabad to protest  against the Agreement.  The latter was denounced asan outrage inflicted upon  Persia by the British, and it was asserted that the Bolshevikshad concluded a close alliance with Afghanistan and the Turkish Caucasus with a viewto delivering the Mohammedan world from slavery.   A strong pan-Islamic flavour wasgiven to the speeches.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     Letters on the  Conclusion of Peace. The Viceroy  of  India telegraphs  that  anumber of letters  have been received from Kabul.  In the first, which is addressed tothe Viceroy, the Amir expresses his satisfaction at the conclusion of peace, and his hopethat friendship will be  established between Afghanistan and Great Britain.   He says,however, that. if Afghanistan had succeeded in acquiring  confirmation  of its complete independence in the first instance hostilities would never have taken place.     The second letter  is  from Mahmud  Tarzi - to  the  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  thanking  God for  the termination  of  hostilities,  which   he  says  mighthave been avoided had a more sympathetic attitude been adopted towards Afghanistan^desire for independence.   It is stated that Afghanistan will be friendly and very useful to British Government in  Asia.                                   .  .     The third  letter consists in an illuminated address for His Majesty  the King,and expresses thankfulness for British recognition of Afghan independence.     The Viceroy points out that all the letters are friendly in tone, but make  it clearthat the Afghans intend to  represent  that  they waged  war to   gain  complete independence and  succeeded in their object.
