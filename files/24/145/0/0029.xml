APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXXIX.                                     TURKEY.    AS yet  there is no official news confirming the  reports of a change  of Govern-ment at Constantinople.   It is, however, almost certain that  Ahmed Tewfik Pasha  isforming  an  administration.   Ahmed  Tewfik was  formerly  Ottoman  Ambassador  inBerlin, then for many years Minister of Foreign  Affairs under  Abdul Hamid, and for about fifteen  days he was made Grand Vizier by  the Committee of Union and Progressduring the critical period covering the actual deposition of the Khalif Abdul Hamid.Later he became Ambassador in  London, where he was posted at  the outbreak of thepresent war.   He married  a German wife, and his sons received a military education  inGermany.  His house  in Constantinople is next door to the German Embassy.  As aoolitical personalia y he may be described as colourless and opaque.   For a  Turk he  issingularly incorruptible, and in personal manners he retains the aristocratic traditions of the old Turks.   Rahmi,  of  Smyrna, is quite a different  character.   Committeemenhave described him as  the  greatest  &quot;snake&quot; in Turkey.   He  belonged to the secondcircle rather than the inner ring  of the C UP.   He is a  Salonican  by birth  and  hasproperties in Macedonia.  He has always been an intimate  ally of Carasso, the Young-Turk leader, also of Salonica.  liahmi is astute, farseeing and strong.   He has proved an effective vali, and has always gone out  of his  way to make  it  appear  to  the Entente,especially to the  British, that he has never been  committed  to  the  full Enver policy,and so would serve a useful turn if the Turco-german  policy collapsed.   He would bea  crafty and a hard bargainer,  especially in regard to the all-important question of the&quot;Straits.&quot;    Sooner or later the Turks  will be driven to unconditional surrender, i.e., to  theacceptance  of the declared aims of the Allied Powers.  Meanwhile  the  politicians atConstantinople will try to get better terms for the Ottoman  Empire than  they deserve,and we should accordingly be well advised  not to  appear to  be  in too  much  ofa  hurry.                                      SYRIA.    The expeditious  efforts of  Feisal and the Arab leaders to arrange the running-up  ofthe  Hashemite flag, and  the  establishment  of  independent Arab  administration  inDamascus,  Sidon, Beirut,  and even  in towns further north, were due to  Arab fearsas to how  the Anglo-French  Agreement of 19 16  will  be construed by the FrenchGovernment and tire  French Colonial party.    General Claytorfs telegrams regarding the attitude of  the  various sections of  thepopulation  in the newly-liberated territory should  be followed with   the  closestattention.   They reveal many conflicting currents,  and the  possibility of some com-plications  for  ourselves as  well as  the French.  Special attention is drawn to  theRavas  telegram in  connection  with  Beirut,  and  the Reuter  comment  (WingateNo.  1488).   The publication of such a telegram from Paris, referring to  the Syrianregions which will &quot;revert&quot; to  France would seriously prejudice  Arab relations at  a mount when Arab claims may be  difficult to  adjust in  view  of  British pledges to  theArabs, and  the allied declarations in  regard to self-determination of peoples and noforcible annexations.

Esme-Howard transmitted [No. 2966]  a message from Mr. Lockhart, dated the 7th October, announcing his arrival at Tornea,arid-yiving a list of the English and French officials still detained by the Bolsheviks.On the  -following; day  Mr.  Clive - telegraphed. [No. 2986] announcing the arrival ofMr. Lockhart and his party at Stockholm.     M. Litvinoff. On the 6th  October  Mr. Clive telegraphed [No.  2946] . that  thesecretary-general  had agreed to refuse to  authorise the entry of M.  Litvinoff intoSweden  until &quot;all the British and French officials detained in Russia should have enteredFinland.     The Samara  Arrests.,  [E.R.-LXXXVIII,  p.   2].-Mr.i Balfour.  telegraphed  toSir Mansfeldt Findlay on the 3rd October [No. 2889]  in regard  to the:&apos;alteged excessesof the &quot;Czecho-Slovaks saying that no information  had been received in confirmation ofthese stories which were  inherently most  improbable. &apos; In  any case;M. Chicherin mustknow perfectly well that we were in no way &quot;responsible  as  we were cut off from Samaraand had  no  control over the Czecho-Slovaks.    -Two day s&quot;&apos;later1 Mr. Alston telegraphed  [No.  116]  from Vladivostock that  he hadbeen assured at the Czech headquarters that so far as they knew there had been.quietat Samara since the.date of its occupation,, that is, four months ago : so that the  eventsreferred  to by M,  Chicherin  could  only have occurred at that.moment when anythingwas possible.&quot;  The headquarters&apos;staff did not believe that  the&apos; Bolshevik allegationswere well founded : though it was true that Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war taken with       [898  -116]                                                          B
arms in their hands had been shot.  Should it be true that there had been executions ofwhich the Czecho-Slovak headquarters were ignorant they must be connected with theRussian civil war, acts for which they incurred no responsibility.NORTHERN REGION.     The New Government. On  the  9th  October Mr.  Lindiey telegraphed  [No.  256]saying that a Government had at last been formed as follows :  M. Chaikovski, president and Minister for Foreign Affairs; Colonel Dourow, Governor-General;  M. Mefodieff,Commerce and  Industry :  M.  Gorodetski,  Justice;   Prince  Kurakin, Finance ;  andM. Znbow (? Education) and Secretary to Government.   M. Grudistov would assist withhis advice as president of the financial and economic council.     The supreme power was vested in M.  Chaikovski alone ; he had authority to dismissor change any \Minister.     The Government was satisfactory from the allied point of view, but all its members,except M. Chaikovski, belonged to bourgeois parties and Mr. Lindiey feared that theeffect of this on the population might be unsatisfactory.SIBERIA.     The Siberian Government at Omsk. Mr.  Alston  telegraphed on  the 1st October[No. 103] that he and the French High Commissioner had received representations fromM. Vologotski that the Siberian Government could not continue its work unless  it received,  within the  next few days, a  subvention  of 15,000,000 roubles, i.e. from300,000Z. to 400,0001., to carry it on  pending the consideration of the question of loans.     Prince  Lvov, who had arrived at Vladivostock en  route for the United States, had assured  him that  the Omsk  Government was  animated  by  all  the  best  Rusaiannational principles ;  in  his  opinion  it  was  the last  hope   of order in Siberia.  he feared that a refusal to help it in this crisis would lead to chaos and Bolshevism.     Telegraphing again  on  the  following  day  [No. 107] Mr. Alston  said that hisFrench colleague was ready, and his Japanese colleague inclined to  support  the  OmskGovernment; the United States Ambassador, on  the  other  hand, was opposed to the giving  encouragement of any  kind his  opinion was that  there would he  no  stableGovernment till the various factions had  fought out their differences in civil war, and  inthe meantime they should be left to work out their own salvation.     On the 5th October Sir Conynghame Greene telegraphed from Tokyo [No. 1044]that he had been informed that the  Japanese Government  had already informed theallied Governments that under  existing conditions it  doubted the wisdom of makingadvances  to  any Russian group.  The Omsk Government was recognised  to be  more promising than its predecessors, but even then a rival Government had recently sprungup at Oufa.  Sir Conynghame Greene had suggested  that before coming to a decision in regard to the present application the Japanese Government  should  await the arrival of  Prince Lvov.     On receipt of this last telegram Mr. Alston telegraphed to Sir Conynghame Greene,on the 6th October, saying that the Omsk Government was not a rival  to the  OufaGovernment, and the Japanese Government  was wrong.   The Oufa Conference wascreating a central  Government on which the Omsk  and other provisional  provincial governments would be dependent.    - The  new All-Russian Government. On the 4th  October Mr. Alston  transmitted[No. 112] a  telegram sent  from Omsk  by the High  Commissioner, who said that thenew All-Russian Government was a directorate not a mere ministry.   It consisted of fivepersons, and by them ministers would before long be appointed.  The directorate claimed to  exercise the functions formerly exercised by the imperial Government :  the seat  ofGovernment would probably  be either Ekaterinburg  or Omsk.  The Siberian Govern-ment at  the latter place was recognised as  an All-Siberian  Provisional Government.The High Commissioner added that though the new All-Russian Government was well received at Omsk, he did not know whether it had the real support of General Alexieff orwhether its members were sufficiently distinguished to command  respect in european russia.     General Horvat. Mr.  Alston telegraphed on  the 5th  October [No.  118]  thatGeneral Horvat and M. Vologodski had agreed to amalgamate their two groups and forma single provisional Government for Siberia.   They had called upon   him  together  toinform  him  of this agreement, which-had been arrived  at in view of the fact that their
 -aims were identical, both parties being animated by a desire to reconstitute a united and strong Russia to renew the war against the common enemy in co-operation  with the allies.  General Horvat would be given a high post in the Government.                                     POLAND.     General  Situation. Sir  Horace  Rumbold  telegraphed  on  the  2nd   October [No. 1736] that he had had a conversation with a notable Pole who had just come  from Poland and Vienna.  He said that the whole of Poland was hostile to Germany, but that not a few had Austrian leanings,  and were inclined to accept as a temporary measure the Austrian  solution of the Polish  question.   But there was no doubt that now, more than ever,  the  policy of the Polish Government would be a waiting one.  Sir Horace Ptumbokfs informant greatly feared a Bolshevik movement against which, if the Germans withdrew their army, the Poles would be defenceless.  The Germans had prevented the Poles  from creating  an army tor home defence ; and now they were exploiting  to the utmost the fear of Bolshevism, of which they had introduced the  seeds.                                   BULGARIA.     Abdication of King Ferdinand. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed from Amsterdam on the 5th October the news of the abdication of King Ferdinand, on the previous day, in favour of Prince Boris, and on the 6th. October be further telegraphed the text of King Ferdinand&apos;s  farewell  manifesto to the  Bulgarian people,   which  ran  as  follows: - Buigars, in view  of the circumstances which have arisen in the kingdom, and which demand from every citizen sacrifices which even include supreme self-sacrifice for the good of our dear fatherland, I am desirous of setting the first example in sacrifice,  and, despite the.sacred ties which for thirty-two years have united our country so firmly and resulted in her prosperity and greatness, to promote which I have given all the strength that I possess, I have  decided to renounce the throne of the Buigars in favour of my eldest son, his Royal Highness the Crown Prince Boris of Tirnovo.     In announcing this decision to my well-beloved people, I appeal to my  faithful and patriotic subjects  to unite as one man around the throne of King Boris, whose name is bound up with so  many great deeds in the history of our ancient kingdom of Bulgaria, and finally to rescue  our fatherland  from her  present difficulties  and i*aise up a new Bulgaria to the greatness  to which she is predestined by fate.  I  pai-t  from  my  dear- Bulgaria with the deepest sadness in my soul, and  I testify to the  whole population of Bulgaria my gratitude for the support which they have  lent me during the course of my reign.     May the  Almighty watch over the  destinies  of the  Bulgarian  people  and guide them to a strong and brilliant future.     Proclamation by King  Boris.-ReuteFs  agent  also telegraphed  the  text  of King Boris&apos;s  proclamation :  Buigars,  my beloved  father has announced his  abdication of the throne in  my favour, and by this great sacrifice of himself to the supreme  interests of the  nation he has given an example of his unwavering love for Bulgaria.   I make known to the  Bulgarian people that from to-day I   sit  on the throne  of the  kings of Bulgaria  under the name  of Boris III.  Born in the beautiful land of  Bulgaria, a spiritual child of the Orthodox faith, brought up in the midst of my beloved people, having shared with my  people in  the joy  of brilliant  exploits and  their unceasing progress, and  mated always by  their ideals and imbued  with their democratic spirit, which  has manifested  itself as much in their traditional  struggles  for  liberty and independence  as in their public and social institutions,  I. solemnly declare  that I will respect the constitution  and  will do my duty with fidelity and self-denial  for the welfare and prosperity of the nation.     Supported by the national good will, and trusting in the protection of the Almighty, I call upon all Buigars to rally round  my  throne and to give me  their whole-hearted support that I may accomplish my sacred dutj^ to my dear country, that I may pass through this time  of supreme  effort  and  hard trial, and  prepare for the  Bulgar race a worthy and happy future.   Long live Bulgaria !     The first decree signed by the  new  king was, Reuter says, for the demobilization of the army.     The Cabinet.- Reuter says that on the  accession  of King Boris the Governmentagain tendered its resignation,  but the King expressed  his confidence  in  his ministers,
 .and requested them to retain their offices.   At an ordinary meeting of the Sobranje, on  Saturday afternoon, the Prime&apos; Minister, M. Malinoif&apos;, said : - We ail i know the extent of  the disaster winch has befallen our country, and we deeply regret this misfortune. .We  all know also that it is due for the most part to the fact that we were not  helped in  time by our allies.   But the past is past, and now we  must look to the present and the  future to repair as much as possible the consequences of the national disaster.   It would  be entirely to the interest of my colleagues and myself to explain everything openly, i but we wish now, as always, to  place the interests  of the  country above  our own , personal.interests. &apos; That is why I  propose to make my report to the-National. Assembly  with closed doors.      iM..Malinoff&apos;s motion was adopted after a short discussion, due to the  opposition of&quot; .,,the Socialists, and the Sobranje then  went into secret  session.                                      GREECE.      Treaty obligations in regard to  Serbia. On the 8th October Lord. Granville tele-  graphed [No. 937] reporting that in the course of conversation M. Venezelos had pointed  out that Greece&apos;s treaty  obligations.  would,-.be, fulfilled when  Serbia had  regained the , territory lost during the  war.  She would be prepared to  go on. fighting, but would (expect  just compensation:  he had mentioned Thrace, and  a  Serbian&quot; concession in-, Macedonia.   Should &quot;there be such  further  fighting,  M. Venezelos  thought that  it  might be presumed that Serbia and Roumania would&apos; more than double their territoiy.                                     TURKEY.      Resignation of  Talaat omd-Enver. -On the  8th  October Sir.Horace Rumbold  telegraphed [No. 1793] that he bad learnt on good authority  that Enver and. Talaat . had resigned, and that Tewfik Pasha  had.been appointed-Grand Vizier.      Telegraphing again  on the following: day [No. 1808] he said two telegrams signed . &quot;Tewfik, Senateur &quot; had, been received at. the&apos; Turkish legation ; one  offering  Osgan &quot;rEffendi the ministry of Posts and Telegraphs,&apos; the other asking--Reced Pasha to  return  to Constantinople immediately.     &apos; Relations with Germany.--Telegraphing on the 4th October [No.  1768] Sir.Horace  Rumbold said that information had been received,-from a source on which he co&apos;uld  rely, to&apos;the effect that the Turkish Government had telegraphed to Berlin  saying that  it was going to ask for peace, as the Central Towers could  not  give adequate help, and  that this had been done  after. discussions  presided over by the Sultan.  To,-this- the  German Government had replied that it was ready to help Turkey in&apos;every way; that  communications would not be interfered with;  and-that measures had ^already been ;.taken, for. the  military  occupation  of Bulgaria.   Pending the  final decision  of the (Turkish Cabinet, which,.was to be taken oh the lstOctober, all reinforcements for, Syria  and the Dardanelles were, beipg heldfip. Sir Horace  Pvumbokfs informant added that;. German troops were being sent to Constantinople by steamer from Ukraina.                                     . TRIPOLI.     .-, The Gi-qnd. Senus^-L-r-Mx. ..Balfour telegraphed to&apos; Sir Reginald  Wingate on the -. ;5th, October  [No. 121,6]..informing  him that  the Italian  Government&quot;had received  information, from. a.  confidential source that  the Grand. Senussi.1 was on the point of  returning to Libya; from a port near Smyrna.                                        SYRIA.     . Proclamation at Damascus of an Arab Kpigdom.-Genei&amp;\ Allenby telegraphed on . .the. 6th October  [No. 690] saying that when his troops entered  Damascus they found , thelArab flag flying from  the Government  buildings  and an  Arab administration in  being, the Arabs having  proclaimed  an Arab Government  under the5 King  of Hejaz  before the Turks had actually left the city; so  soon  as they&apos;had done so, the  Arabs  hoisted the Arab flag.      General Allenby entered the city on the 3rd October, and, in the presence of their  staffs, had an interview with Emir  Feisal, who had entered Damascus on the  same day. -&apos;He  explained to the latter-that he,-General Allenby, was in supreme command so long  as military operations were in  progress, and that all administration must be under his
 control.    But  as  regarded the occupied territory  to  the east of the Jordan, from. Damascus to Maan inclusive, he would recognise the  Arab  administration as a military administration, under his own control,  and would appoint two liaison officers, one British and the other French, between  him and the administration, and  these  officers would communicate with himself through his chief political  officer.     Telegraphing on  the  6th  October [No. 80] General Clayton said  that Ali Pasha Ridi  1 Bikabi had been  appointed  governor of the occupied territory by  the Arab administration,  and had  been recognised as military governor by General Allenby. Major Cornwallis had been appointed British liaison officer and Captain Mercier French ; and Captain. Coulondre  agreed with  him that  these two officers should not separate their duties as regarded the Arab administration, but should work entirely together.     The instructions given to the  British, liaison officer were to  the following  effect : (1)  He should  impress on the  Arab Government  the complete agreement existing between the British and  French Governments.   (2)  He should maintain close touch with his French colleague.  (3) In  regard  to A area, policy should  be based on the principle that the Arab administration must look for assistance and advice to the French Government ; and  all questions relating to that area should be referred to his French colleague.  (4)  The questions which required immediate consideration were the currency, public security, relief of distress, and  the restoration of normal  conditions.  (5) Should it become necessary to do so. he might inform the Arab administration of the general line of demarcation  between the. A and  B and blue areas.  (6) He should remember that all administration was military and under the supreme control of the commander- in-chief so long as the military occupation continued.     Though the establishment of an Arab administration  had been  universally well received, it was too  early to gauge the real feeling of the people.  The general tendency was to turn for everything to the British  authorities :  French influence seemed to be weak.  The only way that the French could secure the  sympathy of the Ax&amp;b and control would- he to enunciate a liberal policy  and contribute generously to the cost of the administration.  The  only French  officers then in Damascus were of junior rank and did not carry much Weight.     Druses from the  Hauran had  co-operated  with the Arab  forces round Deraa and had entered Damascus with them.   They were  certainly not in favour  of the French, and so far as could  be gathered were more inclined to the  British than to any form of Hejaz control.   A certain amount of  looting  by Druses took place when they entered the city, but it was suppressed by Hejaz troops.     The situation,  having regard to the great upheavel occasioned by  the capture of the city from the Turks, and to its great size, was, General Clayton said, wonderfully quiet.   It was essential to  restore normal  conditions as soon as possible in order thatfood  supplies  from  the Hauran should  not  cease,  but there  was  sufficient  for the moment.   The most pressing question was that of Turkish paper  money ; the banks were asking whether it had any value.  The alternatives were :   (l) to introduce some other form of currency ;  and (2) to  fix a value  for  the paper.  If the  first of these should be adopted it would be a severe blow for the holders of Turkish paper.     Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 97]  General Clayton said  that he had learnt that during the Turkish withdrawal, an attempt to  usurp the civil control of  the city by  two  individuals,  Ammed Sayed and  Abdel  Kader-el-Jezari.   The latter  was responsible for local opinion having  been inflamed  against  the occupation of the city by Christians  and adherents of  the King  of Hejaz which led to rioting by Druses  and  Moors.  Both of them were dismissed by  FeisaFs  representative and Abdel Kader was also  imprisoned.     Emir Feisal&apos;s Speech in Damascus. On the 7th October General Clayton tele-&apos;graphed (No. 90] the gist of a speech delivered at Damascus on the 3rd by Emir Feisal.He said that he would make no distinctions whatsoever  between Arabs  of differentcreeds.  To him the man who extended the right hand of friendship was a brother ; and,on the  other hand, to any one  who  should  disobey the orders of the Government heshould,  with like impartiality, be severe.  He should never betray the Arabs.  that day  had been brought  about  by the atrocities of the Turks and the  sufferings of the syrian  nation; and  the reasons for the alliance with Great  Britain, America, Italy, andFrance  were the attainment of freedom and the destruction  of the enemies of the Arabs.But  Hejaz and Syria  were not the only Arab lands ; there were others, such as Aleppo,to be saved from slavery, and he trusted that the Arab sword would  be sheathed only when they were free.
     Occupation of said a. General Clayton telegraphed on the  6th October [No. 81] that said a had been occupied  that  day.   A  temporary governor had  been appointed by the inhabitants who were expecting a representative of the Arab Government to be sent from Damascus to take over the  town; it was  reported  that  the inhabitants of said a (who gave the troops a  great  reception)  disliked the idea  of an Arab governor being sent from Damascus and were anxious that the British  should take over.  The G.O.G. had been instructed by the commander-in-ehief to appoint  an European military governor.     Telegraphing  on  the 8th October, General  Allenby said that  the Arab flag had apparently  been hoisted several  days ago  by Feisafs  order  telegraphed  to  the  local authorities.  On the  night of the 7th Feisal reached  said a accompanied  by Said Elia Khorri; the latter had been told  that no flags  were to be hoisted and that any then flying were to be taken down.     On  the 8th  October General  Clayton telegraphed that two French officers had been appointed military governors of said a and Es Sur.     Occupation of Beirut. On  the 6th October  General Allenby telegraphed that  an Arab administration had been proclaimed in Beirut,  and that a number of regulations for  the  preservation of public security had been made by it.  The proclamation was signed by one Ar Dank, who styled himself chief of  the  Arab Government  in  Beirut. This unexpected action had created  a difficult position, complicated by the fact that the Arab leaders were aware of the assurances contained in the Foreign Office telegram of the  11th June, 1918, to  Sir  Reginald Wingate, in  which His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the  sovereign  independence  of  Arabs inhabiting  areas  emancipated  from Turkish  control by the action of  the Arabs themselves.   The French representative would probably appeal to him  to  iristal a French  military Government  in  place of the Arab administration, and  would request him to  haul down the Arab  flag, which had doubtless been hoisted.  He proposed to appoint one  of his own officers,  French, if possible, to  act as military Governor, to ensure the safeguarding  of military interests, and  further he proposed to forbid the display of any flag so long as  the town and district should be occupied by  the allied forces.     Telegraphing  on  the  7th October,  General Allenby  said  that he  had  been informed that an official protest had been made against the despatch of Arab troops to Beirut.   Captain Coulordre, acting for the French commissioner, had approached Emir Feisal  on the subject  and had asked  him what steps he would take if he, General Allenby, recalled his troops.  Feisal indignantly  denied any ulterior motive  and said that he had acted as he had done purely for military  reasons, to assist in the  expulsion of the Turks, and to prevent disturbance.     General Allenbya liaison officer urged that the  British and  French Governments- were at one in  the desire to assist the Arabs and were arranging the whole question, and that Feisal should take no action.   The latter was soothed but expressed a  fear that the incident would not improve Franco-Arab relations.     Captain Coulondre should not  have approached Emir Feisal  except through him, General Allenby, and had acted contrary to the advice of the British liaison officer;  thequestion was a military one  for  which Feisal  was directly  responsible to  hirn  as commander-in-chief.     Referring  to  the question  of Beirut  in a telegram [No.  80] sent on the  6th October, General   Clayton said  that great dissatisfaction, especially  to Emir  Feisal, would  be caused by the commander-in-chief  appointing a French military governor, but, if French interests were  to  be safe-guarded, this  appeared  inevitable.   The Arab leaders  regarded the assurances  which had already been given  them  as  establishing their right, but it might fairly be said  that  the evacuation of Beirut  was not  due to Arab military action, but  was a direct  consequence of the canture of Damascus  by General  Allenby.     General Allenby telegraphed on the 8th October that  the senior naval  officer had been informed by the French  admiral that he had been instructed by  his  Government to enter Beirut as soon as possible.  On  the same day ReutePs  agent  telegraphed from Paris  that Admiral  Verney had reported to  the Minister  of Marine that the French  division in  Syria had  entered  Beirut  on the  morning of the 7th October amid the indescribable enthusiasm of the population.     On  the 9th October  Sir  Reginald Wingate transmitted [No. 1488] a message from General Clayton saying that the  following passage  occurred in a  Havas telegram from Paris which had been held up pending instructions from the  Foreign Office : &quot; In accordance with the  accord between the allies, Beyrout forms the centre of the Syrian
regions  which  will  revert  to  France.  High  Commissioner  Picot  will  thereforeadminister  the  city  in  the  name  of France  and  reopen an era of fraternity  and collaboration.&quot;     Reuter, he continued, had  commented on  this as follows :   &quot; It is the beginningof the realization of the Entente  agreement  whereby  districts  which  Franco-Britishtroops are now occupying were ceded  to France.&quot;   This  too,  with the accompanyingsummary of the French telegram had been held up.     Country East of the Jordan.- General Clayton telegraphed on the 7 th  October[No. 88] that an Arab military governor would  be appointed as Soon as  possible for theEs  Salt  and Amman districts ;  in  the  meantime  a British officer had  charge of thecivil population.  The situation in those districts was reported to  be quite satisfactory ;refugees were returning  and foodstuffs were sufficient.  It was reported that there were some 400 Armenians at  Amman, they were  being  well  looked  after, and, should it benecessary and they desire- it, they would be sent down to Egypt.     General  Clayton!s  First  Report. (1.) Damascus. The  demonstration of joy  onthe  entry of the  Sherifian troops  exceeded all expectations,  it  was  one  of  frenziedenthusiasm  : there were  undoubtedly dissentients, but for the  time being they judgedit prudent  to join the  majority.   An attempt to assume  civil  control  was  madeby  the  Algerian  element ; failing  in  their effort, they  made inflammatory speechessaying that the  Hejaz  partv were tools  of the Christians  and calling ou the  mobto  expel them, but  they were put  down  by  the  Damascenes.  The  Christiancommunity  bad  hoped  for  foreign conquest  and  was  disappointed.   Towards us,the  local attitude was  one of gratitude,  but  slightly suspicious as to our intentions.The former governmental machinery continued with  an, Arab  military governor  atthe head ; all officials were Arab.  Sanitation, public lighting, and the tramway service were completely neglected by  the Turks in 1017, but efforts were  being made to restorethem to a  peace standard.   (2.) The Hauran.  All  the able-bodied villagers  of this district had joined Sherif Nasir as he marched  forward both  before and after  theTurkish defeat.   Druse intervention had been discouraged by the Arabs; it had beenput  off too long.  The3&apos;- tried  to loot Damascus, and in  consequence had been warnedoff.  Home rule had been declared under the general control of Arab military governors.&apos;(3.)  The Lebanon. After the  expulsion  of the  Turks, which was nearly bloodless, thelocal Moslem committee  hoisted the  Arab flag and  took  control;  but  they were  not supported by King Hussein, and consequently there had been no government since  the1st October.  No information  had come to hand in regard to relations with France.(4.)  Elsewhere.  The inhabitants of Northern Syria  had  been  as prompt  in  raising theArab flag on its own initiative as was the Lebanon.   Palmyra, on the East, andKalaat-el-Husn. on the North, had already  adhered to the King of Hejaz.     General Clayton further said that some of the suspicion of French  intentions  hadbeen allayed by our having permitted the  occupation of Damascus  by King Hussein ;but a bad effect had been produced by a protest  against the local Arab  declaration of independence in the Lebanon, made to Emir Feisal by a French officer.                                   PALESTINE.     Administration of Occ.upi.ed Areas. General Clayton reported on the  6th October[No. 82] that the Chief  Administrator had  taken over  the  following areas, in  whichthe  general conditions  were  satisfactory :  Acre,  Haifa, Tiberias, Nazareth, Nablus,Tulkeram, Selfit, and Jenin.     Telegraphing again  on the 8th October [No. 99] he  said that  the situation  at Acrewas very satisfactory, but the inhabitants, who were strongly pro-British in sympathy,were somewhat  perturbed by  the news of the Arab proclamation  in Beirut.  At  Haifathe opening of a post office had been greatly appreciated;  and general satisfaction  had been  expressed at the treatment of both rich and poor by the&apos; officers and men of theallied forces complaints against the troops  were non-existent.   There  was, too, every reason to be satisfied with the situation  at Nazareth : there was  a sufficiency of food and  the administrative council of the municipality was working.                                     ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Congratulations  from  King Hussein. The King of  Hejaz  sent  the  following telegram lo His Majesty the  King  on the occasion of  the surrender of Bulgaria:  The-
unconditional surrender of Bulgaria constitutes one of the last&quot; phases of the final moral&apos;and material victory.   There is no need  either to make  mention of my share in theglory and honour on  such happy event or  to  convey  my congratulations  to  yourImperial Majesty and to the British nation.     And later on the same day another relating  to  the taking  of Damascus :  On thissolemn day, which will be consecrated by the nation among the memorable days of ourannals, we have been able at first this morning  to  convey our congratulations on theoccasion  of the surrender of Bulgaria to  the defenders  of the  right cause,  whichconstitutes the success of the efforts of your Majesty and  those of your noble nation ;and the opening of the last  phases of the  final victory, which is the victory of justice and laws of nations and their safeguard  against  any trespass and aggression.   Lastly,,we are happy to congratulate your Majesty on the capture of Damascus by your army.     To these messages His Majesty replied as follows :  Your Lordship&apos;s most  touchingmessage was received by me  with feelings of the  deepest satisfaction.   I take this opportunity of expressing my great admiration for the generalship  of your  son, the emir Feisal, and the  gallantry of your  Lordship&apos;s  troops and allies,  whose  effective co-operation contributed  so materially to  the success  of  the  allied  operations which resulted  in the liberation of Damascus and  in the extension of Arab emancipation fromtyranny.     The  Italian Government&apos;s wish to  -participate  in  Operations. Sir Rennell Roddtelegraphed from  Rome  on  the 3rd  October [No.  709] that, as a  Moslem  Powerholding a colony on the Red Sea, the Italian Government  was  of  opinion that it was entitled to participate actively in the liberation of the Moslem holy cities and that ItalVsprestige had been considerably damaged  by the  fact that she had not already  taken part in these operations.   The Italian Government  intended to appoint an officer to actas military attache  at  Jeddah ;  and  was instructing  its ambassador in London  toinform Mr.. Balfbur of its intention to send  a limited force  to join the  Arab and allied forces in Arabia, such force to consist of Italian Moslem troops under Italian officers.  .     In regard to this, Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed on the 4th October [No. 1468]his hopes that the Italian request would be refused;  he said that, both from a naval andfrom a military point of  view, such participation  would be even  more inopportune  thanit was a year ago.     In reply to this, Sir  Rennell Rodd telegraphed on the 5th October [No. 720] sayingthat  he  feared  that a difficult situation would  be  created if the Italian application should  meet with  the  refusal advocated  by Sir  Reginald Wingate.   The wish  toparticipate  had been  revived by the request  to Italy to supply ammunition for Idrisi.Hitherto he himself had constantly  discouraged the raising  of  the question of the participation of Italy in Hejaz operations;  but Italy had prestige to  maintain, and  its government had to explain its exclusion  to those at home, and that  exclusion was theless  reasonable in that France, which had  no  Red  Sea territory, had  been allowed toparticipate, whilst excluded Italy occupied so much  of the opposite coast.YEMEN.     Loheiya  and  Atu. Sir Reginald   Wingate  telegraphed  on. the  6th  October[No.  1487] that,  according to a report received from Aden,  Atu and  Loheiya wereoccupied by the Turks;  and that the inhabitants of the latter town had left it.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     The Vilayats of Basrah and Bagdad. It was announced in the &quot; London  Gazette &quot;of the 4th October that the vilayats of Basrah and Baghdad, excluding the  district ofAnah on the Euphrates,  might be regarded as territory in friendly occupation.                                     PERSIA.     Financial Assistance. Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to  Sir  Percy   Cox on the 7thOctober [No. 524] authorising him to increase the  financial assistance to the PersianGovernment as  proposed  in  Sir  Charles  Marling&apos;s telegram  of  the 8th September[E.R.-LXXXV, p.  5], so far as exchange conditions permitted.
