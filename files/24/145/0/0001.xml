APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN   REPORT. No.  LXI                                     RUSSIA.     THE  six forms of assistance tendered by the Bolsheviks to  the allies mentioned by Mr.  Lockhart are  interesting.  They  may  not appeal  to our  minds either assubstantial or efficacious, but they serve to show the construction which Bolsheviks  feelentitled to put on their own acts.  It is to be remembered that the Bolsheviks by theirown accounts put universal social revolution as their objective,  and naturally considerthat we should be grateful  for  any inconvenience that their policy  may  cause  to  theenemy, even though  on striking a balance the inconvenience they cause  us  ma)? bemuph greater.     If  the great German  offensive in the  West  contributed towards  producing  a revolution  in France and Great Britain it would be  welcome to the  Bolsheviks, eventhough it added  to the territory of the German empire, for  they would argue that eventhough  one Imperialist State had benefited, two others had disappeared.     The scheme of  producing a Bolshevik army, is  not taking shape very  rapidly.M. Trotsky has apparently reverted  DO  elected  officers  and  experts controlled   bycommissaries.                                    PALESTINE.     The Palestinian report is satisfactory.                                     PERSIA.     The Persian section should be read ;  the alliance between the Persians and  theTurks is not a  natural one.   The  double dislike of the Shia-Iranian Persian  for  theSunni-Turanian Turk may give us souse opportunities at a later date.

The Bolsheviks and the  Allies, Mr. Lockhart telegraphing from Moscow on the18th March [No. 24]  called  attention to the various ways in which the Bolsheviks hadhelped the cause of the Allies : (l) Twice in 1.917 they prevented the Government beingtaken over by Russian reactionaries who were  under  German control. . Had either ofthese movements succeeded, there would have been a  separate  peace  with  Germany on german  terms;  and there  would  have been  real  co-operation  with  that Power, aco-operation of the kind attempted  by  the  Racla of Ukraina.   (2)   They  had sent alarge quantity of poisonous literature into  Germany, Austria, and Hungary, of a kindcalculated to help in breaking the morale of the inhabitants of those countries.   (3) at brest they destroyed the false claims of a desire for democratic peace and  showed thenecessity of war for the protection of the integrity of Russia by unmasking  to the whole world  the  true purpose of German imperialism.  (4) They  had steadily  held Russiaagainst the pro-German capitalist and (? banker) class which would welcome with open armsthe German advance.    (5) They had fought and held  for a time at any rate the FinnishWhite Guards who were  supported by the pro-German Finns and Swedes.   (6) Theyhad successfully fought the Ukrainian  Rada and  so,  for a time, prevented the CentralPowers from benefiting by the resources of  Southern Russia.     The NPW Army and  M.  Trotsky. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 21st March[No. 32] from Moscow that M. Trotsky had asked  for  English and American instructorsfor his new army with the  organisation  of which  he was proceeding energetically.The American  military attache had^ advised him  to  make  use of the services of theFrench military  mission to Roumania  (many of whose members were in  Moscow), onthe ground that several weeks must elapse before American or English instructors could come.   There had seemed but little hope that  M.  Trotsky would accept  French help,.
but be had telephoned to say that he would welcome it;  this, Mr. Lockhart said shouldbe sufficient proof of his intentions.   War and an understanding with the Allies nowformed the foundation  of his policy which the Americans were vigorously supporting ;the  French  mission,  too,   Mr.   Lockhart  understood,  had  altered  its attitude.Telegraphing  again  on the following day [No. 38] Mr. Lockhart said that GeneralLavergne had officially accepted M. Trotsky&apos;s request for help in the reorganisation ofthe army.   Pending instructions, he himself had  appointed  Captain Garstin  british representative on the military committee assisting M. Trotsky.    Request for  Supplies from Archangel. Mr.  Lockhart telegraphed on the  22ndMarch [No. 36] that M. Trotsky had stated that the Bolsheviks were quite willing topay for  any help  the allies might  give  them,  and  he  was  anxious to  receive Britishsupplies from Archangel.  Mr. Lockhart said that  he could not urge too strongly thatour chance of obtaining or destroying war stores in Russia [see  below]  depended more on co-operation  with the  Bolsheviks than on independent action.   M. Trotsky- had pointed  out that the loans repudiated by the Bolsheviks were  those of  former RussianGovernments;  if he  could get  supplies from Archangel he  was willing  to  give in exhange anything he could spare.    Destruction of Stores, ic-Mr, Lockhart telegraphed on the 21st March [No.  33]that M. Trotsky was giving  every assistance in the  destruction of stores, railway, &amp;c,to a  committee  of  British, French, and  American  officers  which he had  formed.M. Trotsky said that the Bolsheviks were definitively committed to war.    Untrustworthy Reports.-Mr.  Lockhart telegraphed  on  the  22nd March [No.  35]that German agents and the Russian bomgeoise were circulating rumours of the wildestdescription ; in particular he said that the story of a German  control commission inPetrograd was a pure invention.LITHUANIA.    The Question of the Recognition of Independence. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed toSir Esme Howard on the 22nd March [No. 497] that he might reply to  an enquiry whichhad been made to him on this subject, that  His Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to theprinciple of self-determination, and  would not accept  any settlement  violating this principle as permanent, but it could not  recognise the independence  of Lithuania,  as itwas entirely occupied by the enemy.                                  ROUMANIA.    The New Cabinet. Lord Bertie transmitted [Nos. 417 and 423] on the 20th and21st March telegrams  from the allied Ministers at  Jassy stating that  a Cabinet  hadbeen formed by M. Marghiloman,  whose name sufficiently showed what its tendencieswould  be.   The  new  Cabinet  was,  with  the  exception of the head  and M.  Arion,composed of men ofi secondary importance.  M. Arion, who was Minister  for  ForeignAffairs, though he had  remained  at Bucharest, had maintained a conciliatory attitudetowards  the Entente; he was  a  well-known politician  and  had several  times  beenMinister.                                    GREECE.    The New Archbishop j,n Oyprus.-Lovd Granville telegraphed from Athens on the22nd March [No.  2o6] that on the occasion of his enthronization, which had  taken placeon the previous&apos;day,  the new archbishop had referred to Cyprus, whose keen anxiety tobe united to Greece was. he said, well  known. . His personal conviction was  that, inview of the liberal and friendly sentiments of Great Britain, it  might  be  regarded asactrrally belonging to Greece, the  only condition remaining to be fultilled being that thelatter Power should show that she  understood both her obligations and  her rights.The &quot; Messager,&quot; Lord Granville  said, had, in a leading article, spoken in high praise ofthis utterance.                                   ARABIA.Asm,    Monetary  Help for  Idrisi. Sir  R.  Wingate telegraphed on  the 20th March[No. 519] that the resident  at  Aden had recommended  that  Idrisi should  be  given a present  of 25,0001., as he and  Mustafa-el-Idrisi  had run considerably into  debt onaccount of operations against the  Turks ; and further, so  long as  those operations should
justify it, a grant of 12,0001. a month.  Sir R. Wingate, considering  it very necessarythat Idrisi should be kept active, endorsed  the residents advice.                                   PALESTINE.     The Holy Places.-Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on  the 21st March [No. 110838/5]that, with  a special permit  issued  by the  military  governors  and under  adequatesupervision, officers and men were now permitted to visit the holy places of Jerusalemand Bethlehem.     The Moslems. The Moslems, he said,  appeared to be surprised that King Husseinhad not yet visited Jerusalem for prayer in the mosque of Omar ; if he or Sheiif Feisalcould pay a&apos; visit, it would stimulate interest in the Arab  movement.   He  also saidthat  the  Moslems  were looking forward for permission being granted for -the annualpilgrimage  to  the tomb of  Moses  near  Jericho,  which should  take  place on the26th April.     The Arabs. Sir R. Wingate further said that the  attitude of the people in thecountry districts continued to be excellent.   He especially mentioned the Arabs of theBeersheba district;  the pro-Turkish feeling  had, he said, disappeared and the people were increasingly friendly.     Zionists. It was also stated iii the above-mentioned telegram that  the  EgyptianZionist Committee  had written to the Commande,r-in-Chief handsomely acknowledgingwhat the military authorities  had done for the Jews, and  warmly  thanking him for having allowed them to visit Palestine.                               NORTHERN SYRIA.     The Arah  Movement. -In a telegram dated the 21st March Sir R. Wingate saidthat, although  the  feeling in  northern Syria was pro-British and extremely anti-Turk,from information received  it  appeared  that  but little was  known there of  the  Arabmovement.                                RUSSIA  IN  ASIA.CAUCASUS.     Tiflis  and the Bolsheviks. Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed  on  the  20th  March[No. 235] that the  Bolsheviks did not control Tiflis, according to a Russian officer whohad come from that place with Captain Noel.SIBERIA.     German Prisoners of  War. Mr. Wardrop telegraphed  from Moscow on the 21stMarch [No. 105] that  an official telephone conversation with Irkutsk showed that thestories of  German  prisoners  of war controlling the Siberian railway were  false andridiculous.  This was published in the &quot; Pravda,&quot; which had been transferred fromPetrograd and incorporated in the &quot;Social Democrat.&quot;                                     PERSIA.     Note  from  the  Government. Sir  C.  Maiding telegraphed  on the  21st March[No. 240]  that  the  Persian  Government  had replied  to  his  communication [E.R.,LIX, pp.  3 and 4], and that the following  was the  substance of its note :      1.  The  Persian  Government . had  repeatedly protested  against  the  military (? aggression of) the  belligerents in Persia;  it  regarded   the present action of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in  replacing  Russian troops by British and in maintaining theSouthern  Persian  Rifles as contrary to the promises of Great Britain to respect the, independence and neutrality of Persia.   It requested the withdrawal  of our troops.     2.  Gratification was expressed in regard to the promise  of revision of the tariff andto  the support given in the matter of Persia&apos;s withdrawal of her recognition of the1907 agreement.     3.  As  regarded  officers  from a neutral country for the  contemplated uniformedpolice force, it objected to the condition  that the selection should  be  determined byagreement  between the two Governments  as infringing  the  right  of the PersianGovernment to (? notifications) on abrogation of the ultimatum of 19 LI, and as confirmed in  &quot; such other pernicious agreements.&quot;
     4. It demanded unconditional participation in the peace conference on the groundthat Persia, unlike other  neutrals,  had  suffered losses  through the  operations  ofthe belligerents.     5. It expressed regret for the arrest of the vice-consul and bank manager at Reshtwhose release it was endeavouring to effect; but.it held the British military authorities responsible because they had arrested Suliman Mirza on Persian soil.     6. As regarded financial assistance it  considered that it had a right to  what hadbeen asked for in its note of the 1st February, and it hoped that this would be paid.     7. In conclusion the note stated that the  Persian  Government felt confident  thatwith the  assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government in meeting  its reasonable  wishes,  itwould succeed in maintaining its neutrality and in preserving order in the interior.  1     In another telegram of the same date [No. 241] Sir C. Marling pointed out that this note put forward new pretensions  in  assuming that we  were  prepared to scrap thewhole of the 1911 ultimatum, in insisting  on unconditional participation in  the peacecongress,  in declining the  suggestion  of  an  agreement  as to the nationality of theofficers, and in renewing its unreasonable demand in regard to excess customs receipts.     Turkey and Persia. Sir H.  Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 20th March[No. 402] that great confidence was felt in the efforts which were being  made to winover Northern Persia (together with  Turkestan and the Caucasus) to Turkey.  Infor-mation had  been received that  five young Persians who  had been studying in berlin and others who had  been studying in the military college  in Constantinople were being&apos;sent there.     The Jangalis. -Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 22nd March [No. 243] that theBelgian administrator of Customs had told him that it seemed, certain that all customson the Caspian Sea from Astara  to Tnnekabun were controlled by the Jangalis.   the administrator had been  informed  that  the Jangalis were working  up  trouble  nearAstrabad.     TJrumia. Sir  C.  Marling telegraphed on the 24th  March [No.  249]  that theGovernor-General of Tabriz  bad been asked by the Christians  and Moslems of Urumiato try to establish a  modus vivendi there by means of a mixed&apos;commission consisting ofMr. Shipley (representing the consular  body), the  Armenian bishop of Tabriz, a repre-sentative of the democratic party,  and the  Karguzars of Tabriz and Salinas.   ThePersian Government had welcomed the  proposal, the French Minister saw no objection,and Sir C. Marling thought such a commission might be helpful.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.    M. Trotsky and War with Germany. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 23rd March[No. 40] transmitting  a message from Captain  Stin [sic], who said that M. Trotskyhad  formally asked  him  and the representatives of the United States, France, andItaly&apos;to ask their respective Governments for  help  against  Germany, with whom he considered war  to be inevitable.  A number of former officers would be reinstated, butthe army would  have  to  be reconstructed, and for  this  he  begged for help from theallies.   General Lavergne had rejDresented France at  the interview, General Ronei Italy,and Captain Riggs the United States, and  all  three agreed with him that this was  a genuine effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to resist German militarism.UKRALNIA.     The Civil War. Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed  on  the 25th March [No. 45] that hehad  been informed  by the Minister for  Foreign Affairs  that the fighting was being-conducted with great  cruelty on. both sides ; the Bolsheviks had retaken Cherson andNicolaiev.  Captured Germans were put to death.                                MESOPOTAMIA.
