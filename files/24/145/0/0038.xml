On the 8th December-Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir Charles  Eliot [No. 199] and Mr.  Lindley [No.  389],saying that in order to prevent misapprehension as to its aims, now that  an armisticehad been  concluded, it was necessary for  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to explain its attitude in regard to Russia.     Apparently, he said, it was commonly supposed that troops had been despatched toRussia  for the purpose  of carrying out a campaign against  Bolshevism,  to restoredecent order and a stable government; this, however, was not the case.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  had   constantly maintained  that it was  for  the  Russians  to  choosetheir own  form of government, and that it had no  desire to intervene in their  domestic affairs ; its motive in sending troops was the prevention of the transfer of German forces to the western front.     But  it did not follow that the  British Government could forthwith  dissociateitself from Russian  affairs ; obligations had been created which outlived the occasionswhich gave them birth.  Anti-Bolshevist  administrations had grown  up  under  theshelter  of  the allied forces;  we were  responsible  for  their existence, and we mustendeavour to  support them.  It was not  possible to  say how such  a policy would ultimately develop,  but for the present His  Majesty&apos;s Government  had no  alternative,and must  use its troops to the best advantage ; where  there were no troops it mustsupply money and arms, and in the case of  the Baltic provinces it must protect, as faras it could, the nascent nationalities by means of the fleet.     Feeling in regard to France. Lord  Kilmarnock reported  on the 9th  December[No. 3701] that he  had received information to the  effect that there was considerablefeeling  in  Russia against France,  as  it  was believed that  she was insisting on there-establishment of  monarchy.  The Russian  Jews were bitter  against France becauseshe was- believed to  be adopting a clerical policy, and because she was  also believed  tobe opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state  in Palestine.
THE CRIMEA.     Prevention of Bolshevism. On the 9th December Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 99]to the high commissioner  in Constantinople in reply to his telegram in regard to theprevention of  the  formation  of a new Bolshevist centre  in the Crimea.  Mr. Balfoursaid that he  was quite alive to the  desirability of  this,  but it was primarily for theFrench Government to take the required steps as the Crimea was in the  French sphere.SIBERIA.     The Omsk Dictatorship. Sir Charles Eliot reported on the 3rd December [No. 298]that many Social Revolutionaries had joined the Bolsheviks in consequence of admiral kolchak&apos;s assumption of power.                                                                        *     Admiral Kolchak and  General Semenoff. On the 4th December,  Sir Charles Eliotreported [No.  247] that General Horvat had been informed  by telegram that admiral kolchak had deprived  Semenoff  of his command  and had  appointed Voloff governor-general of Irkutsk and commander of semenoff&apos;s troops, with orders to arrest Semenoffhimself in the  event of his proving contumacious.     Attitude  of the Japanese. On the  4th December, Sir Charles  Eliot  reported[No. 303] that the  Japanese  were becoming recognized as  the protectors of Semenoffand Kalmykov and accepted responsibility.   Telegraphing again on the following day[No. 308] he said that it had  been reported by the agent of the Omsk Government thatthe Japanese had said that  an armed affray between the troops of Admiral Kolchak and&quot;those of Semenoff would not be allowed by  the Japanese Government.   This the agentunderstood to  imply that any claim by  the Omsk Government to authority  to the  east-of Lake Baikal would not be  admitted by the Japanese.     On the 6th  December  Sir Conynghame Greene [No. 1200] reported that information had been received on good  authority to the  effect  that  the  Japanese  Government  haddefinitely prevented Semenoff  from  declaring  the independence of the three easternprovinces, and&apos; that it would  induce him to  place himself under the orders  of GeneralHorvat who had recognized  the  authority of Admiral Kolchak.  The last named hadbeen in turn warned that he would be thrown over by Japan  and his subsidy  withdrawnshould any further  execution take  place without  the participation  of the allies in thecourt-martial.     General Korniloff.- On  the  7th December Sir Charles Eliot transmitted hNo. 319j^a telegram, dated the 5th December, from the consular officer at Omsk, who said thatGeneral  Korniloff&apos;s position was getting stronger every day.  He had not been able tofind details of any definite  plot  against the generals life, but every possible  precautionwas being taken to prevent any attempt that  might be made by the  Social Revolu-tionaries being successful.                                   ESTHONIA.     The Russian Northern Army. -On the 7th December Lord Kilmarnock reported[No. 3671]  that the  Esthonian  delegate  in Copenhagen had received a tele*gram fromMr. Poska informing him that, instead of continuing the fight against the Bolsheviks,the North Russian armiy was  marching on Reval, under the command of Baltic Germans,with the object of re-establishing the Landesrat.   Should  this be effected, there was a danger  of the outbreak of  civil war ; the  Esthonian working men would  turn to theBolsheviks to  escape the rule of the Landesrat.     In a previous telegram [No. 3651] sent on the  4th  December, Lord Kilmarnocksaid  that  information  had been received of the North  Russian army having been soseverely defeated on the 25th November that it could not be reconstituted.     On the 9th December Mr. Clive  reported [No. 3644] that according to an Esthonianmilitary communique the Russian northern army (anti-Bolshevik) had placed itself underthe Esthonian supreme command.                                     LATVIA.     The Provisional Recognition.-On the 3rd December Mr. Clive reported [No. 3594]that Mr. Tschakste, president  of the Peoples&apos; Council  of the republic  of Latvia, andMr. Semgals, its vice-president, who had  arrived from Riga, had  called on him and-asked that their deep  sense  of gratitude for the provisional recognition accorded by
     His Majesty1 s Government to the republic of Latvia might be conveyed to Mr. Balfour.    &apos; Mr. Clive added that they had expressed the  hope that His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentll    would send a representative to Riga.                                         POLAND.     The Alleged Pogroms. On the 8th  December Mr. Barclay reported [No. 5470]that he  had received a  note  from the  State Department informing him  that theUnited  States  ambassador  had  been  instructed  to  inform  the Polish   national committee in Paris of the receipt by  the State Department of reports from  varioussources  relative  to  pogroms  directed against the Jews in Poland  and that,  if these reports were true, such proceedings could not fail to affect the  sympathy  of american people for Polish aspirations.     Mr. Barclay added that in a despatch now on  its way he had reported that adenial of the truth  of the reported  massacres  of Jews in Poland had been issued tothe  press by the  Polish  information  bureau in the United States which described the stories as German propaganda.   On the other hand  the Zionist  organisation  andthe American Jewish committee had issued another statement insisting on the truth ofthe stories of pogroms.  In referring to the suggestion of the Polish national committeethat a committee of  Americans should be appointed to investigate the  charges theyaccused M. Dmowski and M. Paderewski of having refused to take any action to  preventthe outrages.     On the same day Sir Horace Rumbold  reported [No.  2418] that Count Zaleskihad  made  the following communication  to him under  instructions from the PolishMinister for Foreign Affairs :      Having learnt  that Jewish  organisations  abroad have made  representations tothe allied Governments with a view  to  the  despatch to  Poland  by the latter  of acommission  to  enquire  into  the  alleged   excesses  against.  the  Jews,  the PolishGovernment hastens to state that in the event of one (? or, omitted) several of the alliedPowers proposing to send to Poland  a  mission in the above, or any other, connexionthe  said Government would be  the first to welcome  it and to give it all  possiblefacilities.     On the  10th  December Mr.  Balfour instructed [No.  2725] Sir G. Graham toinform the  French  Government that  tlis Majesty&apos;s  Government had decided  to sendan unofficial mission to Poland to report on the political situation, which would  include an investigation into the facts regarding the alleged pogroms.     Demand for  the  withdrawal  of  German Troops. On the  4th December  sir horace Rumbold reported [No.  2372] that the Polish  Government had sent a  note tothe German Government demanding the  immediate withdrawal of the latter&apos;s troops from Poland.  The  main reason for this, he- was informed by Count Zaleski, was theformation of Soviets by German soldiers in eastern Poland, which obviously constituted a.great danger.                                   RUMANIA,     The Dobrudja. On the  3rd December Sir George Grahame transmitted [No. 1676]&apos;a telegram, dated the 24th November,  which had been received from the allied ministers at Jassy.   It was to the effect that the King  of Rumania and his  Government  were much perturbed by  a telegram from  General  Franchet cVEsperey, intimating  that the bulgarian troops were to evacuate Dobrudja, which, till the treaty of peace should havesettled  its final status,  was to be  occupied by the allied troops, so treating  it as.disputable territory.  This, the allied ministers said, formally contradicted the assuranceswhich, under instructions from their respective Governments, had been given  by them on more than one occasion.  The Government had pointed out  that  the  elections were about to take place, and that, to enable Dobrudja to take part in them, there  must beno delay in the reinstallation  of the Rumanian authorities in that province.     Entry of the King into Bucharest. Sir George Barclay reported  [No. 510] on the-2nd December that the King of Rumania had made  his formal entry into Bucharest,accompanied by  the   Queen,&apos; on  the  previous  day.   Their Majestv&apos;s had, he  said,,received an enthusiastic welcome.       [898-125]                                                      B  2
                                    TURKEY.     Stiggested Approach to America. Admiral  Webb reported on  the 5th December[No. 110J that he had just learnt, from a reliable though secret source, of a  plan  for turkey to approach America, asking for her protection and offering to accept Americanadvisers in every administrative department  and at the  same time to grant importantconcessions to Americans.  The idea was that, whilst in a few years&apos; time new friendswould be  found to play off against the Americans, the  immediate  result would be the saving of the Ottoman Empire  from partition.   The Turks were working on these linesthrough the masonic lodges ; Admiral Webb thought the scheme must have originatedwith the Jewdsh members of the C.U.P.                                      EGYPT.     The Nationalist Movement. Sir Reginald Wingate reported on the 4th December;[No. 1810] that he had discussed the present nationalist aspirations with  the Sultan,who showed clearly that he had been influenced  by national sentiments  though he didnot express any desire to emancipate himself or his country from the British protectorate.The Sultan  said  that his views were  shared  by the prime  minister,  who wished to resign if he could not be permitted to  present his own case in London Sir ReginaldWiugate had already informed Rushdi  Pasha that a visit from him would be welcomedat a more convenient date.  Adly Pasha associated himself with Rushdi, and the Sultanconsidered that the two ministers should be granted a hearing without delay.    - Sir Reginald Wingate  told  the  Sultan that he should not  hesitate to take the strongest measures, as the movement was a  subversive  one.  The Sultan  rejoined  by saying that the  Anglo-French  declaration in regard to  the  Arabs  showed that self-determination was part of our policy and that Egyptians might well expect concessions.     On the 3rd December Sir Reginald Wingate received Rushdi Pasha, who tenderedhis resignation.     That morning, the 4th December, he had again visited the Sultan,  and had statedemphatically that His Majesty&apos;s Government was most desirous of discussing the future government of Egypt with Egyptians, but that it was impossible  for this to be done atpresent.  He had also most seriously warned him of the danger of being  connected withany agitation.  The Sultan asserted his loyalty to the protectorate ;  but reiterated  his views as to the need of the  ministers  visiting  London forthwith,  as  in no other waycould the Egyptian standpoint be understood.     Adly Pasha had also resigned.  In a conversation with Mr. Dunlop he had referredto - the  fact that the most extreme Indian agitators had  been given a hearing, both inIndia and in  England, and  added that he had heard that the Emir Feisal had gone toFrance.     Sir Reginald said that he  understood that the resignations were irrevocable :  it wasregrettable that  two of the best ministers  should  be lost.   The  formation of  a new cabinet would not be an easy matter.    The  Sultan and  his two ministers  appeared tobe obsessed with the fear that  some vital decision might be given in regard to  Egyptwithout the purely Egyptian point of view having been heard.     On the following day Sir Reginald Wingate transmitted  [No.  1814] the followingtranslation of a telegram to Mr. Lloyd George from  Saad  Pasha  Zaglul, which  he,Sir Reginald, had instructed the censor to stop :      Events are taking  place in Egypt  so greatly at variance with British traditions ofliberty and justice,  and with  the  liberal policy of which your Excellency has alwaysbeen the champion,  that Egyptians  have begun  to  wonder whether the principlesproclaimed unceasingly by  statesmen of. the empire  in the declarations  which they make  daily, refer only to certain sections  of humanity to the exclusion of others lessfavoured.     Does your Excellency consider that the  voice of an  entire country should  not beallowed to make itself  heard at a time when  from all sides rises  the cry of peoplesclaiming their right to exist and to dispose freely of their destinies ?     At the triumphant issue of a struggle undertaken in the cause of liberty does yourgreat country allow that in its name the most  serious injury  should be wrought to thatsame liberty ?   Conscious of her rights and obligations, Egypt  has considered it  herduty to herself to enlighten British opinion in   regard to  the real situation, and to setforth the  national aspirations which she expects  to see  realised through the justice ofthat opinion.
    Now the authorities have not only forbidden the circulation of mandates giving adeputation, formed with the above object, authority to defend the  cause of Egypt, butendeavour  also to place obstacles in the way of the  departure of that  deputation  for england.    This constitutes an endeavour to raise  between British and Egyptian (? opinion) a kind of barrier which will render it most difficult for the former to  be fully informed by drawing on its most natural source of information.    In the name of the Egyptian deputation I draw the attention of your Excellency tothese facts, and submit them to your high appreciation.                                  ABYSSINIA.     France  and  the  Arms  Traffic. On the  7th  December Lord  Derby  reported[No. 1719] that the minister for foreign  affairs had assured him  that he fully con-curred in the desirability of preventing arms and ammunition from reaching Abyssinia,and that the French  Government would act in perfect harmony with  us in all matters connected with that country.                                  PALESTINE.     Zionism. Telegraphing on the 5th  December  [No. 213] General Clayton said thatthe present trend of political events was  not inspiring the Arabs with  confidence in therealization of their national aspirations in Syria.  Apart from this it should be realizedthat in Palestine Arab national ambitions counted for but little, as there the concern ofthe  non-Jewish population was  the  maintenance of a position which, in their opinion,was threatened by Zionism.   Much local excitement had been caused  by the Anglo-French declaration, the armistice, and the approach  of the  peace conference; and  bothZionists  and  the non-Jewish population thought the  moment had come to proclaim theirwishes before  any definite settlement  in regard  to  the  peace  conference had  beenreached.   It was possible that, in order to show their opposition to Zionism, some anti-Jewish action might be taken by the Arabs.  Approximately the non-Jewish populationwas 573,000  as against 66,000 Jews.                                    ARABIA.     Medina  [E.R. XCVII. p. 5]. Sir Reginald Wingate reported on the 6th December[No. 1826] that Fakhri had announced that he would only surrender Medina on a dulycertified  written order from the  Turkish  Government: he would not act on telegraphicinstructions.   If the surrender  did not soon take place, Sir Reginald said, the safety ofprisoners during the evacuation might  be seriously endangered.   Telegraphing again on the following day [No.  1829] he said that  according to information received  fromJeddah,  fear that Fakhri was acting in collusion  with Ibn Saud explained, to a largeextent,  the  sherifian  irritation at the  delay in the surrender.   In another telegram[No. 1853], sent on the 9th December, he said that  reports had  for some time past beencurrent in Hejaz that  Fakhri Pasha was  in communication with the Ikhwan of Khurmaand Nejd, if not with Ibn Saud himself.     Ikhwan activities  and Ibn Saud. Telegraphing on the 6th December [No.  1827]Sir Reginald Wingate said that information had been received from King  Hussein tothe  effect that the Ikhwan had attacked and carried off 400  sacks of flour with otherbooty from Dghadjah,  Shakrfs main supply base.   The King  said that  this aggressionwas so close  to his capital that only by urgent representations to Ibn Saud could a crisisbe averted.  He suggested that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government should  send an ultimatum to Ibn Saud  requiring  the dispersal of various Ikhwan concentrations  within a period of thirty-five days, and added that if this could not be done there was no  alternative to hiswithdrawal, i.e., abdication.     In regard to this  Colonel Wilson said that  undoubtedly there had been an increaseof Ikhwan activity and there were indications that  Ibn Saud was behind it : he thoughttoo that the  King had good reason to fear the  spread of Wahabite  influence in Hejaz,and the danger not  only to his prestige  but to the peace of his country justified military- opposition.
     Telegraphing again on the  10th December  [No.  1857]  Sir  Reginald Wingate-reported that Colonel Wilson  had been  informed  by King Hussein  that Sultan IbnBijad was marching on Mecca  at the head of an Ikhwan  force.     The situation, in the opinion of  Colonel Wilson, was very serious,&apos; and, with a viewto enforcing the withdrawal from the west of the Ikhwan, he  urged  the necessity  of putting all possible pressure on Ibn Saud.  Sir Reginald Wingate himself thought thatthere could be no  doubt that the  Ikhwan  constituted a menace to the security  ofMecca ; and, he said, a  Wahabite irruption into Hejaz, with  the risk of sectarianwarfare in the neighbourhood  of the Moslem sanctuaries, could not be tolerated.   Thenecessity  of  protecting the orthodox Sunni shrines  and  of preventing widespreadconflagration  demanded firm  action with Ibn Saud;  he strongly recommended theimmediate despatch by His Majesty&apos;s Government of peremptory instructions  to with-draw all militant Ikhwan from the neighbourhood of Khurma.                                    PERSIA.     Mission to Europe.- Sir Percy Cox reported on the 8th December [No. 1036] thathe  had been informed  by the prime  minister  that Musta,ver-ul-Mamalek  had beenchosen for the mission to Europe : Vossugh-ed-Dowleh said that he had at first opposed the appointment but circumstances had been  too strong for him.  Sir. Percy Cox addedthat he had referred to the matter at an interview with  the Shah, and that His Majestyhad said that being foreign minister, Mustaver was the person  who would naturally go-on  such a mission though he had not thought of him at first ; Vossugh-ed-Dowleh,however, could not possibly leave and other influential persons had refused.     Vossugh-ed-Dowleh and the Shah. On the 8th December Sir Percy Cox  reported[No. 1034] that the relations between the Shah  and his prime  minister were  gettingmore and more strained.  Vossugh-ed-Dowleh complained that the Shah, by unneceS&apos;sarily meddling, obstructed the work of the council, and last  week he handed in his resignation in  consequence of high words which passed  between him and the  Shahafter a  council meeting at  which the latter was  present.   His resignation  was not accepted.     The opening was seized by the  extreme democratic  elements: political meetings-were held, revolutionary and Bolshevik talk was indulged in.  After repeated warningsthe prime minister had a number arrested and deported  toKasvin; no democrats of thefirst rank being  among them.   Vossugh issued  a manifesto  giving reasons for his action.  The public had, in general, accepted the arrests and the manifesto  in  a goodspirit: the Shah, however, had been  got at by Vossugh&apos;s opponents and the court party,and had shown signs of going back on the cabinet.     Sir Percy Cox had, therefore, at the request of the cabinet, asked for an audience.He had urged the vital importance of the Shah  in  his own  interests  backing thecabinet  in its efforts to  suppress revolutionary propaganda  and to  maintain order.Ultimately the Shah had promised to *do so, but had protested against Vossugh having taken such action without first consulting him : he had  also  argued that  the arrest oftwo or&quot;  three  leading men would have been sufficient  for the purnose.   This mattersettled,  the  Shah  had  violently attacked  Vossugh, saying  that,  believing  himself:indispensable and emboldened by our  support, he was playing the dictator ; and further,that he had treated him, the Shah,  with intolerable disrespect.   Unless Vossugh&apos;attitude were changed, he or the Shah himself must leave the stage.   Sir Percy urged the importance of finding a modus  vivendi, and tried to bring him to a better frame  of mind.  His efforts apparently  had some effect, as after  he had left the&quot;palace the Shahdismissed  the friends  and relations of the deported democrats who had gone thereto protest.  Vossugh had  promised to  ask  for an  audience  and to  do  his  best tocome to an understanding ; in  case of failure he had asked that Sir Percy Cox should.P-O with him to the Shah.
