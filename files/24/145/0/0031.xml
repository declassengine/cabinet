SECRET.131APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  EASTERN REPORT, No.  XCI.                                   TURKEY.    IN  reading  the news under this heading regarding the change of Cabinet it  isimportant  to note that the Government  remains in all essentials PRO-GER1VEANind C.U.P.  Talaat is the real ruler, and if he dispenses with his followers and puts.ip dummies in their place it is only to deceive the world.  There can be no question oflie C.U.P. being pro-Entente.    It  is further to be noted that the  idea  that either the German warships or thej-erman garrison holds  Constantinople in  awe, which is being steadily propagated invarious quarters, is entirely fallacious.  The Germans only exist in Constantinople with;he sanction of the C.TJ.P.   The day the  C.U.P. desires to dispense with the Germanshey will have  to go or surrender, as it is  within the power of the CUP. to cut offbeir food  supply, paralyse their communications, and deny them all power of move-nent.    These  are not questions of theory but absolute certainty.                                    SYRIA.    The situation has improved.                               OTHER SUBJECTS.

Sir Mansfeldt  Findley reported on the  27th  October [No.  3712]that M. Litvinoff and, with three exceptions, the members of his party had been givenvisas by the  Swedish charge d&apos;affaires.  The three who were to remain in Norway,pending the departure  from Russia of the  three  French officials  still detained, wereMM. Kriscaka, Baitler, and Schcoyroff.   M. Litvinoff alleged that French officials were not included in the agreement, and that therefore the detention of these membersof his party was a breach thereof.     The British Embassy in Petrograd. -Sir Walter Townley telegraphed from TheHague  on the 22nd October [No.  3682] saying that the Dutch  minister  at Petrogradhad reported  that most  of the  embassy  documents were intact, but  forty  boxes of provisions, a quantity of wine,  some  diamonds and money  had been stolen.   Further,that all reports of a conspiracy discovered in the embassy  were without foundation : andthat nine persons arrested therein were still in prison.TRANS-CASPIA.     The Askabad Committee on the British Troops. The commander-in-chief  in  Indiatelegraphed a report which he had received  from General Malleson to. the effect that, hehad received a resolution  expressing  unbounded admiration tor the gallant conduct ofthe British troops from the Askabad  committee, which was  doubtless grateful, this being  the fourth  occasion in which we had  saved their  Government and their necks.Having praised our men, they went on to say that in regard to their own they  proposedto  hold a drastic  inquiry and  a  court-martial:  such fierce talk was nothing new, itwas all sound and  fury.   So far from executing the real criminals, they dare  not evenput them on their  trial.   Possibly we might  be  asked to administer justice ; but he,General Malleson, would not accept the  task, as  it would  be most unfortunate for our troops to act as executioners, to say  nothing of the consideration  that if one  began toshoot  Russians it  would not be easy to decide where the  line should be drawn.        [898-118]                                                           B
                                    TURKEY.     General  Situation. Sir  Horace  Rumbold  telegraphed on the  10th  October[No.  1821] that information had  been received  from Kemal Bey,  brother-in-law ofTalaat Pasha,, and  Nazit Bey, of the Turkish consulate in Vienna, to the following effect: Turkey&apos;s greatest present difficulty is famine.  The merchants are holding backtheir stocks, as they will not sell for paper money, and popular discontent is fanned bythe press, which is allowed to attack the profiteers.  Many of the newspapers  are  alsoattacking  the Young  Turks, whose  influence is altogether on the  decline withinthe C.U.P.     There are now  four parties, which are  led respectively by Talaat,  Enver, Chukri,and Jemal.   The three last  are more or less hostile to each other, but there is no opposition to Talaat, and he will remain the  l-eal  head of affairs, whether iu or out of office.   He is now decidedly in opposition to Enver, and is working hard to  undermine the German influence in the country.     The Germans are more unpopular than  ever with the people, and their embassy is constantly guarded  by  troops.   Anti-German feeling has  grown  much among  theofficers ever since the Sultan took to acting independently of Enver Pasha.     The New Cabinet. Reuter&apos;s agent reported from Amsterdam on the 20th Octoberthat a Constantinople telegram, dated the 13th October, stated  that the new TurkishCabinet had  been definitely  constituted as follows :   Izzet Pasha, Grand Vizier  and minister of War ; Reshid Akif Pasha, President of the  Council; Riuf Bey, Marine ;Hulussi Effendi, Shaykh-ul-Islam ;  Rifaat Pasha, Foreign  Affairs ; Fethi Bey, Interior;Javid  Bey,  Finance; Jelale Mukhtar  Bey,  Food Controller;  Hayri  Effendi, Justice ;Zia Pasha, Public Works; Said Bey, Education ; Abdul Rahman  Cherif Bey,  PiousFoundations.    Reuter also reports that a decree by the Sultan mentions as the special aim of theGovernment  the removal  of the effects of four  years of war,  the  establishment ofharmony among  all classes of the  population, and the immediate settlement of foodquestions.   At a sitting  of the Chamber  the  President,  Halil Bey, said that  thelast phase of the war had, unfortunately, not been so favourable for  Turkey, who for four years had passed from  victory to victory.  He claimed that Turkey had done agreat service to humanity  in keeping back the army  of Tsaristic Russia from central europe.  &quot; Whatever the final result may be,&quot; he said, &quot; Turkey, by its display of self-sacrifice and patriotism, has  won  its right to an honourable place  in the family ofnations.&quot;                                     EGYPT.     The Syrian Community and French  Political  Aiwis. Sir  Reginald  Wingatereported on the  19th October [No. 1541] that whilst the views of such of the Syriancommunity as adhered to the French  had had free expression  in the press, as  being inconformity with  the  declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  the  censor hadgenerally prevented the  expression of the opinion of those who were opposed to whatthey believed to be French political aims in Syria, on the ground that the discussion ofcontentious subjects in the press might excite partisan disputes.   But he, Sir  ReginaldWingate, was of opinion that this censorship  should now  be relaxed, so that those who held anti-French views might state those views with moderation.  The party opposed tothe French was in the majority,  and comprised, both  Christians and  Moslems.     The question had arisen in connection  with a  pamphlet  which had  been refusedpublication some fifteen months ago ;  and Sir Reginald Wingate thought the prohibitionmust be cancelled unless we were prepared to incur the charge of deliberately  muzzlingpublic opinion.  The  pamphlet  in  question, which was  tactfully  worded, had been written by a Lebanese Christian, Adib Pasha by name, who was president of the society of the Allied Lebanese, which advocated a large and practically independent  Lebanon,its programme being opposed to  French policy as it was understood  in Egypt.     In reply to this, Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 22nd October [No. 1270] informingSir Reginald Wingate that it was undesirable to make any immediate change  in regardto the censorship, in view of the rather  strained relations between the  Arabs  and  theFrench and other causes of unrest  in Syria.   Further, if possible, a warning to  bemoderate and non-provocative should  be given to French  propagandists.
                                  ABYSSINIA.     Attitude Towards the Allies. Mr. Campbell  telegraphed from Adis Abeba on the&apos;17th October reported  that the  recent victories had made a great impression.on theAbyssinians, who now sought the friendship of the allies,  but appeared anxious as tothe fate of Abyssinia,  His Italian colleague had informed him. that he had seized theopportunity to impress on the Idegent the necessity of inviting the chiefs concerned totake immediate steps for the proper control of the northern  frontier and to build theroads and bridges  which had  been demanded.  Failing concurrence, the Italians were ready to support the Regent in obtaining obedience  by force.  The Italian  ministerbad. suggested that by  this means he could  strengthen  the position of the  Regent;nevertheless, the Italians must have the necessary force ready, and it seemed that theirpolicy tended to become aggressive.                                    TRIPOLI.     The Grand Senussi [E.R. LXXXIX, p.  4].-On the&apos;19th October  Mr. Balfourinformed [No. 1266] Sir Reginald Wingate that  the  Italian Government  had learntthat the Grand Senussi had left Constantinople for Smyrna, whence  he  would proceedto Milas* and would embark in a German submarine  in  the neighbourhood.  He also informed him that it was reported that Prince Fuad,  Colonel Zia Bey,  two Senussistand two German officers had reached Milas from Tripoli on the 14th September and were proceeding to Constantinople.   It was thought that Enver  Pasha might  endeavour tojoin them and return to Libia to take command of the rebel forces.     On  the  same day Sir Rennell Rodd  reported  [No.  761]  that  the ItalianGovernment had learnt a week previously that Said Ahmed had  left  Constantinoplesome little time ago in a submarine, but had been stopped in the Sea of Marmora.                                     SYRIA.     French Representative. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to General Clayton on the 22ndOctober [No. 216] informing him  that M. Picot was being sent to Syria by the. FrenchGovernment as its representative.     The Anglo-French Agreement of 1916. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir Rennell Roddon the 22nd October [No. 1581],  informing him that a declaration  would be issued atonce by the British and French Governments to  the effect that, whilst proposing tohelp the liberated native population to establish Governments, they had no intention of imposing on them any special form.     Mr. Balfour further informed him that a modus vivendi  for the administration ofthose areas in&apos;Asia Minor and Syria which, in the agreements made in  1916, had been recognised  as being of French interest had been  arrived at, and that the Italian Government had expressed  its  concurrence in its terms.   It had  been  made perfectly clear to the French Government that it was only to apply to such territories as were or might be  occupied by General Allen by&apos;s forces, and was to be  treated  solely as aprovision for the situation created by our military advance.     The collapse of Russia and the entry of  the  United  States into the  war had so completely changed the  situation that the  provisions of the agreement in regard to other territories mentioned therein were no longer suitable.  The French Government had been informed that in the  opinion of His  Majesty&apos;s Government it would be useless to attempt a settlement at present, and the latter had suggested fresh conversations in which the Italian and American Governments should  take part  : there  was reason for thinking that this view commended itself to the French Government.     Mr. Balfour added that in expressing to the  Italian ambassador the wish that the latter&apos;s Government should take  part in such  discussions, he had assured him that there was no intention to call in question the validity of the treaty of London, 1915.     Arabs and French. General Allenby reported on the  17th  October that he had communicated to Emir Feisal and to the military administrator at Beirut the  approved policy which had been communicated to the King of Hejaz.  He had also assured the emir that no measures  taken  now would prejudice the  final settlement at the peace conference, they being  purely provisional ; he had given this assurance because Emir Feisal greatly distrusted French intentions, and was fearful that a settlement on the &apos; basis of self-determination might be  prejudiced.  He had added  that any military governor                         * In the Gulf of Mendelia, south of Smyrna.
 found mixing himself up in politics  would be removed.  Any injudicious pressing of&quot; their own interests by the French would only confirm the  suspicions  of the  Arabs, to the detriment of French and British  alike, and the only thing which would dispel their uneasiness would be  a public declaration of policy by the  two allied  Governments. Emir  Feisal  himself  was probably  being pressed by his father and  his followers ; General Allenby had urged him to place a whole-hearted trust in the good faith of  the allies, who were bound in honour to try to reach a settlement in accordance with  the wishes of the Arab people, and he appeared to be reassured.  He had also told him that doubtless the Arabs would be represented at the peace conference.     General Clayton  had already telegraphed on the  loth October  saying that  the necessity for a definite declaration that there would be no question of annexation, open or veiled, in any  part of Syria was  still the  crux of the situation ;  without such a declaration of policy, made  by the  French and British  Governments, the Arabs would have no wish to accept French assistance.     Telegraphing again on the 18th  October [No. 129] General  Clayton said  that he and General Allenby had talked with Emir Feisal that day.  All  his representatives and the governors sent into the vilayet of Beirut and the Lebanon were being withdrawn by him : he  was somewhat reassured, and trusted  implicitly  in  General  Allenby&apos;s assurances and the good faith of the British Government.   The situation  would  become much more satisfactory, General Clayton added, if the Arabs could be reassured on  the question, of an outlet to the Mediterranean, as they were seriously preoccupied by it.     On the 19th October General Clayton reported [No. 130] the intended resignation of Captain Mercier, the French liaison  officer,  on the ground that his position  was impossible owing to  the  attitude of  his Government.   He had stated this unofficially, and had expressed the opinion that the Arab opposition  would not cease till the French Government had made a satisfactory  declaration.     The Arab Government. General Clayton reported on  the 15th October that  the military governor of Damascus was showing himself  to be zealous and capable ;  the town wras quiet and  clean, and  the improvement of the general  situation reflected. credit on the Arab administration.     Before leaving,  the Turks had collected the greater  part  of  the  year&apos;s taxes, and Emir Feisal estimated that, till taxes were available, 200,000/. a month must be &apos;ound for the upkeep of  the  administration  in the Arab occupied territory.     Telegraphing again on the 22nd  [No.  3222]  he said that, by visiting the chief&quot; religious heads, Emir Feisal had created a good impression  among both  Christians and Jews :  speaking at the catholic  church on the previous  day, he had emphasized  the equality of religions and the necessity for unity in the common cause.   His popularity among  the townsfolk of Damascus was increasing.  He proposed  to raise a gendarmerie force of  8,500  men, of whom  half  would be  mounted, and  a  standing army of two brigades.  Needing assistance, he had asked  King Hussein to send Emir  Abdulla to take charge of political matters and foreign affairs.     The Druses. In his telegram of the 15th  October General  Clayton said that he had had a private  visit from  the  chiefs of  the  Druses of Jebel Druse,  who had unanimously  asked  for British protection.  General Clayton  informed them that there could be no question  of this, more especially as they belonged  to the  area  in which French interest was predominant; but  he hoped  that  between  the  Druses and the British there would be a continuance  of  the traditional friendship.   He  urged them to support the Arab Government loyally, and assured  them  that  that Government would be a national one, and would safeguard  the  interests of every section of  thepopulation.     Telegraphing again on the 22nd October [No.  3222] he reported  that the British political officer at Beirut had received a visit  from Nessib Be Atrash, of the  Hauran Druses, who had shown a conciliatory spirit and a willingness to accept whatever shouldJoe considered  best for his people by the British Government.     Beirut. In his telegram [No. 3222], General Clayton said that according to reports dated the 20th October the dislike  of the great majority of the  inhabitants of Beirut for an Arab government had been confirmed  by the brief rule of Shukri  Pasha [four days].   The reorganization of the administration was proceeding satisfactorily.     Amman and Salt. In the same telegram [No.  3222] General Clayton also reported. that Gaafar Pasha would leave Maan as soon as possible to take up the appointment of military governor of the Amman and  Salt districts.
     The Lebanon.  General  Clayton reported on the 22nd October  [No. 3222] that measures were being taken to relieve the distress which was still great especially in theprovinces; that a primary school bad been started; that the collection of arms and deserterswas in progress ;  and that unobjectionable Turkish officials who had signified their willing-ness to serve, had been  retained as  there was at present  no source from which otherscould be drawn.   The first necessity was that of communications which was being dealtwith;  and  other matters which  required  and were receiving attention  were  public security, the restarting  of provincial courts, and the issue of seed.     Ladihiya. -The G.O.C. in C. Egypt reported  on the  21st  October that he hadbeen  informed  by  Emir  Eeisal that the  inhabitants  of this coast-town, within theFrench  area, had  declared for  the Arab Government, and that, therefore, he,  Feisal,had appointed a miltary governor who  had  been instructed to  obey all orders  of theG O.C.  in  C.   In  view  of  the  inaccessibility  of the place, considerable  difficulties would be created were any unacceptable regime enforced, and  the G.O.C.  in  C. hadnotified Emir Feisal of  bis ajDproval of the appointment of Rashid Tulih as  military governor.     Armenian Refugees. General Clayton  reported on  the 22nd October [No. 3222]that the Armenian  community in Egypt had sent l,0OOZ.  to  Damascus for  the  relief of the refugees in the Deraa  district, some 2,000 in number, who would be repatriatedwhen there  were sufficient transport facilities.                                  PALESTINE.     General Situation, General Clayton reported on the 22nd October [No.  131] thatthe  general attitude  of the  population  continued to  be satisfactory.   Police  andgendarmerie were being enrolled;  law-courts and post services were being organised ;new municipalities had  been formed  at  Acre and Nazareth ; and schools  had been opened  at  those  two places  and at  Haifa.   General  Clayton  added   that  muchsatisfaction  had been given  at Acre by the remission of the unpaid  balance of titheon account of the unfavourable economic situation.     Public  Security in  Jerusalem. The  &quot; Palestine  News,&quot;  which  is published  byGeneral  Allenby&apos;s headquarter staff,  gives, in  its issue  of the 19th  September, thefollowing account of the measures adopted for public security :      Under  the Turkish regime the preservation of public order was in the hands of twoforces :  (1)  the police,  and  (2) the  gendarmerie  (mounted  and dismounted) ;  the composition and role of these forces was quite distinct.  The police were recruited fromthe educated or &quot; effendi &quot; class,  and were solely employed in maintaining law andorder in cities and towns.  The gendarmerie, on  the  other hand, were  drawn from thewell-to-do farmer  families,  and were  responsible for public  security  in  the country districts ; the mounted men provided and kept their own horses.     As both these forces  had been disbanded by  the Turks  before  they evacuatedJerusalem, it was necessary to create and reorganise them completely.  This was thetask that confronted  the  enemy  occupied  territory administration, and  it was notrendered any the easier by the fact that most of  the able-bodied  men in the country had been drafted into the Turkish  army;   The administration did not, however, allowmany days to elapse after the occupation of Jerusalem before  taking the first steps tocreate the nucleus of the new forces which  were destined to take the place of thosewhich  had  been  disbanded.   Some members  of the old Turkish police  force stdlremained in the city, and to these were gradually added new recruits  drawn from  allthe  communities.   It is true  that  these new recruits had  little  acquaintance withdrill or discipline, and had no technical training in police, work  or duties.  Indeed,their chief qualification as members of the new force was a genuine desire to serve thenew administration  honestly  and  well.   Drill  and discipline  have  been graduallyinstilled, and daily parades, which all  men  off duty are compelled  to  attend, are nowheld under British  officers.   A. course of  lectures and  instruction has supplied thegroundwork of training in  the technical  branches of police work, and the best proof that those who six months ago were raw  recruits are proving apt pupils in  their newcalling lies in the results obtained.
     Crimes of violence have been conspicuous by their absence,  and the perpetrators of   1almost every serious theft or burglary have been brought to justice.   The population has begun to place confidence in the new force, and  the fact that it is generally known thatany complaints  of the conduct of the police are immediately investigated by a british officer has given assurance to all that the methods of the old regime can no longer be repeated under the occupied enemy territory administration.     The police stations during the Turkish domination were notorious  throughout thecountry for the  manner  in  winch  they abused the authority which their position gave them as representatives of the law, and the contrast provided by present conditions hasbeen remarked upon by the public on all sides.     Some  surprise was expressed at the continued appearance of police  in the streets of jerusalem, loug after the occupation,  in the uniform of the old  Turkish police, but thiswas unavoidable during the interval while the new uniforms were being prepared.   TheTurkish uniform has  now  disappeared  completely,  and has been  succeeded by khakiuniform and &quot; maghrabi &quot; and &quot; emma&quot; for the police, and  &quot; kufiya &quot; head-dress for thegendarmerie.  A training school is about to be formed where all recruits will be sent onjoining.  At this school recruits will  undergo  a complete course of training, includingdrill, musketry, police duties,  investigation of crime, civil procedure, \*c, and by thismeans it is  hoped that  a  highly trained and efficient  force will be established  inPalestine.     There is another organisation which, though strictly no part of the forces mentionedabove, is so intimately connected with the preservation of order in the city of Jerusalemthat it should not pass unnoticed.   This.force is known as the &quot;haras&quot;  or night watch-men, and  it is  supported  by  a special cess levied on house and shop rents.   Theestablishment laid down by  the  Turks for the city,  amounted to about  100  men,but  upon  the occupation scarcely more than  a  dozen of the lowest  type  were to befound at duty.   The  money collected from the population to  pay this force had beenappropriated by some official,  and no record was kept in  the finance department.   Aclean sweep was made of the old &quot; haras &quot; and fifty new recruits were enlisted.   The cessto pay this force is now collected by men  attached to the finance department, and the&quot; haras &quot; are paid regularly  by the Treasury.  The assessment was formerly levied mostinequitably, and it is  now being substituted by a new  assessment  made  by a special commission composed of members of the police and the  municipality and verified by aBritish official.     Jewish Rejoicings in Jerusalem  over  the  Liberation of Galilee. The &quot;PalestineNews&quot; for  the 3rd October  publishes  the following note :      The British liberation  of Palestine has  set the whole Jewish community  ablazewith joy.  People rub their eyes and exclaim, &quot; Are we dreaming, or do  we see things asthey really are ? &quot;     The blow came down so suddenly, the Turkish  debacle is  so complete that manyquote DeboralTs song, chanted thousands  of years  ago, in  the very place  where therecent operations had occurred.  &quot; They fought from heaven, the stars  in their coursesfought against Sisera, the river of Kishon swept them away.&quot;     Many Jewish notables had been banished to Galilee, and every  other family  inJuclea had either relatives or friends  in  the  north ;  and it was with  impatience thattheir liberation had been expected.     People who have already arrived from Galilee say that the  scenes  that  took placethere when the first British troops, their deliverers, arrived are indescribable.  Soldierswere carried shoulder high, and treated to the best of refreshments.  People embracedone another and wept for joy.     At Jerusalem  the excitement reached to  zenith on Wednesday, when  a  mons trdemonstration took place in which more than  10,000  Jews took part.   The  processionleft the grounds adjoining the  Alliance school, wended  its way down the Jaffa gate,thence  to  the  military  governors.   Banners  were  flying  with such  inscriptions  asil Long  live  the rule of justice !&quot;  &quot; Long live  the  liberating army!&quot;  &quot; Long liveAllenby, the liberator of Palestine I&quot; &quot; Long live the Jewish battalion !&quot;  &quot; God will buildGalilee,&quot; &amp;c.     The  crowd  when it  reached  Government  House  was  one  seething  mass  of humanity.     The military  governor, Colonel  Storrs, with  his staff, made their appearance  onthe balcony, and a shout of enthusiasm went  up from the crowd: &quot;Long live England,Long live the army, Victory to the allies. !&quot;  Colonel Storrs, addressing the throng of
-people in Hebrew, said :  &quot; Thank you very much, may God&apos;s blessing rest on you andon us.&quot;     The &quot; chassidim,&quot; dressed in their long satin robes of blazing colours, then made acircle and danced, accompanied by the clapping of hands of  others in the crowd.     Jerusalem has probably not witnessed such an animated scene since the  days whenJewish  pilgrims  flocked to lay  sacrifices on  the altar   of  the Temple, and the enthusiasm displayed by the people can never be forgotten.     The demonstration was followed by rejoicing in the synagogues, after prayers had &apos;been recited for the welfare of the British royal family and the continued  victory  ofthe troops.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     King Hussein. General  Clayton reported on  the  22nd October [No.  32z2] that king Hussein was showing&apos; anxiety to proceed to Damascus and had addressed a letteron the subject to Sir Reginald Wingate.   The latter had recommended the King not to identify himself personally with  the  military government which  was being exercisedthrough Emir Feisal and General Allenby, and had  also pointed out the  system  ofmilitary control, which had been communicated to the King,  would take some timeto work out;  at a later date Emir Feisal would be able to proceed to Mecca and thererender him a full report.     Armistice asked for by Fakhri Pasha. Sir Reginald Wingate reported  on the17th October [No. 1527] that the King of Hejaz had refused  a three days&apos; armisticeasked for by  Fakhri Pasha, who  had sent  a  verbal message asking  for this  that  he might consider the question of the surrender of Medina.   The request was  believed tobe  insincere.   A  more vigorous  prosecution  of the siege  was being undertaken byEmir Abdulla.NEJD.     Ibn Saud. The  political agent at Baghdad telegraphed on  the 16th  October[No. 8789] that in his opinion the time  had come for making Ibn Saud clearly uuder-stand that he must comply with  the orders of His Majesty&apos;s Government or take theconsequences;  he had an  exaggerated sense of  his  own importance, and this seemed. as favourable a moment  as any  likely to occur to bring  him to his bearings.  Hejrecommended that Mr. Philby should be  withdrawn  and Lieutenant-Colonel Leachmansent to explain to Ibn Saud that : (1)  His Majesty&apos;s Government  was prepared  tocontinue the subsidy of 10,OO0Z. a month till the end of the war, but failure  on the partof Ibn Saud to comply  with the orders of His  Majesty&apos;s Government would entailnot only the  stoppage of that subsidy, but a reconsideration of policy in regard to him;(2) no more arms could be given  to him at px-esent;  and (3) that there was no reasonto modify the orders already given to him that, in view of the fall of Damascus, furtherhostilities against Ibn Rashid wex-e not called for.  At the  same time he, the  politicalagent,  would ask that the possibility of making a declaration on the lines suggestedin his  telegram of the 7th August should be considered.     In regard to this, Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed  on  the 21st October [No.1548] that, from his point of view, these proposals were  entirely satisfactory.   But asregarded the suggestion in  the final  sentence he thought: (1) That we  should insist that the Hejaz boundary  question was a subject for direct  negotiations  between ibn saud and the King of the Hejaz : though His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a third  party,would be ready to assist both principals to reach a just settlement and, if required, toarbitrate between them.  (2) That it should be made perfectly clear that we would not,in view of the proximity of  Khorma and of Ikhwan activity  there, restrain the  Kingfrom reasserting his authority over the recalcitrant Emir Khalid ;  but that  we should require him not to adopt an aggressive policy eastwards of Khorma.                                     PERSIA.     The American Relief  Commission. Sir Percy Cox  reported on the 20th October[No.  95]  that a soldier friend, who had recently visited all the chief centres in north-west Persia  on military  duty, had written to  him in regard to the  American ReliefCommission, of which he had seen a good deal  whilst in Baghdad.  The sense of  hisfriend&apos;s letter was that, judging  from conversations he had had, not only with members
of the commission, but also with American doctors and missionaries whom he had met in his travels, its main object was not the relief of the poor.   Those with whom he had spoken  were convinced that America was not only peculiarly fitted but  bad a specialcall  to  set  in order  the internal affairs of Persia, urging  that this  would  be morepalatable to Russia than  any other  solution of the  Persian  problem, and  at the same&apos;&apos;time should be welcomed by Great Britain in that a strong buffer state would be created by an English-speaking and allied Government.o
