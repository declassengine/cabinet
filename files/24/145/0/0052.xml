RUSSIA.                                   ,     M. Lenin&apos;s Political Principles.-On the  12th March  M. Trotsky,  plenipotentiary   9representative of Turkestan in Moscow, sent the following  telegram to the committeeof the seventh congress of the Soviets of Turkestan at Tashkent:      I transmit a summary  of  the principles  put forward by comrade  Lenin, in his report on the bourgeois and  proletariat democracies.     The imperialist world war,  wdiich prepared the ground  for the  proletarian revo-lution, opened the eyes of the working classes  throughout the world  to the fact  thatbourgeois democracy, equality, and freedom mean exploitation of the working class,and  created the revolutionary  movement  which  has led to universal unrest in  theproletarian masses.     2.  Marx and Engels said that the most democratic bourgeois republic was  only a means of enabling a smail group  of  exploiters  to  oppress  the working class and thelabouring masses.     3.  The historical  experiment of  the Paris  commune, and the history of bourgeoisrepublics up to the present day, clearly show what conditional and limited value  thebourgeois parliamentany system  and bourgeois democracy  have for  the  proletariatmasses.  The bourgeois  parliamentary system  and bourgeois  democracy  have alwaysretained state administration on the  basis of the division of authority, which is  only a police system for the protection of the  existing regime,  and makes the  personal  andpolitical freedom proclaimed  in bourgeois democratic republics a mockery so far  as thelabouring masses are concerned.     4.  The Berne, conference, which  is the  outcome of the growth of the  revolutionary movement throughout the  world, defends the general  principles of  democracy  anddictatorship  apart from their  class  meaning, and  has  therefore  departed  from  theprinciples laid down in Marx&apos;s teaching, which points out  that the  struggle againstthe  exploiters must  inevitably  be   a  class   struggle.  &quot;Therefore  the  majority  ofthe  Berne  conference  has joined  the  reactionary  ranks of the &quot; yellow &quot; &quot; Inter-nationale.&quot;     5.  The  proletariat can  only free itself from the  oppression   of the  capitalistsystem by proclaiming its own dictatorship and seizing political authority.     6.  True democratic freedom of the labouring  masses  can only be attained by theabolition of bourgeois laws., and  tbe freeing of labour by the socialization of industry.       [756]-383                                                          B .
      7. Both political economy and Marx&apos;s principles  indicate that class war cannot be based on compromise, and- that there must either be the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeois.      8. The fundamental difference between  these  dictatorships  is that whilst that of the bourgeois means the forcible suppression  of the resistance of an enormous majority of the population, viz., the working class, that  of the  working class means the forcible suppression of the  resistance  of  a small group  of exploiters,  viz.,  the insignificant minority of the population which consists of  landowners and capitalists.      9. The dictatorship of the proletariat makes it  necessary  to change the form of state administration by bringing that system into closer touch with  the people.   This can be achieved by  giving authority to the class organizations representing the exploited workmen and semi-proletarian peasantry, who  during the bourgeois dictatorship were not allowed any part in state administration.      10.  The victory of socialism can  only be  attained by abolishing the army as  an instrument of oppression and the arming of the proletariat after the disarmament of the bourgeois.        ,      11.  The form of government known as  the dictatorship of  the proletariat is  best represented by the soviet form of  government, which  has destroyed  the old bourgeois bureaucratic and legal form of administration, with the help of the united masses.      12.  The Berne conference in attempting  to unite  the  system  of Soviets,  i.e., dictatorship of the proletariat, with the  constituent assembly, i.e., dictatorship of the bourgeoisie,  has  shown  the poverty  of ideas of the &quot;yellow&quot; socialists,  and  the reactionary character of the insignificant cowardly bourgeois &quot;concessions made to  the growing strength of the new proletarian  democracy.  1      13. In condemning bolshevism the &quot;yellow&quot; Berne &quot;Internationale&quot; showed  that its  interests  were  those  of the  Russian,  mensheviks,  social-revolutionaries,  and Scheidemannists, who by  their actions have proved  that  in the civil war they sided with the bourgeoisie against the workmen.     A Soviet Appeal to those preparing to wage  War on Russia.- On the 17th March the following message was sent out from the wireless stations of the  Russian  govern- ment&apos;: To all peoples who are preparing  to wage war  against Russia.  For many years the Russian  people and the other peoples living in Russia have suffered and are  now exhausted by the long war and all the troubles connected with it.  In addition Russia is living through a difficult time of internal social revolution which absorbs all its forces. By the will of the people the war was  brought to an end:  the people  freed from Tsardom threw down their arms and returned to their homes. The Brest-Litovsk peace treaty was merely  the confirmation of  an  already accomplished  fact.   The Russian people and its present government are against war, but  to our  great regret you are preparing to attack us again, and,  in the name of militarism, which is opposed to the conscience of the people, you compel us again to take up arms.     We make the following appeal: Put your sword into the sheath and  stretch out your hand to us  in  fraternal  greeting.  Why do  you stand armed against us,  and what  is your desire ?  There are in your midst manv Russians who have  no reason wdratever to fight against their own brethren, and who in the depth of their soul are only striving for a peaceful life.   Besides, there are  in your midst Czecho-Slovaks, a Slav people  which, related by blood, tried for  centuries to unite with us Russians.  Why do you want to stain your hands with  the blood of your brethren ?  Further, there are European, American, Asiatic, and African peoples  preparing war against Russia,  and with  a bleeding  heart  we are putting to  you the question, Why do you  seek after our blood and our life and cause us to sorrow  ?  Is it that you fear the spreading of the idea of communism ?  But do you not know the  old truth that the  force  of every idea grows in proportion  to the resistance it meets ?  Let  this  idea run its normal course; for IF  the new social order is consolidated, no armed force will be able to destroy it.  By allowing it to take its normal course you will spare your own forces, and you will learnits benefit to yourselves.   Should the communist idea  he  stillborn, it will disappear by itself without fighting and shedding^ of  blood.   You who want to dominate Russia have on your banner the  words &quot;Justice and  Liberty,&quot; but in the depth of your soul other motives induce you to attack our peaceloving people.   Follow our fraternal advice  and try to repress these motives, and let  us then march hand in hand on the road to truthand freedom.  Russia possesses riches in which we can share fraternally in so far as you.place at our disposal your experience  in industry  and science.   N.0  doubt  your ownconscience is uneasy  in regard to  the unnecessary shedding of blood in a fight against our people.   The  fact that you have made an offer  to start peace negotiations with
Russian representatives proves that  your heart,  as ours,  suffers from the  fraternalmurder from  which humanity has suffered for so many years.  It is the more sad inthat this fraternal murder is taking place between  Christians who ought not to kill butto love their  enemies.   Let us think  not of the  continuation  of  this shameful  andpurposeless fraternal murder but of its speedy termination.   Let us direct all our efforts to the establishment of peace and well-being over the whole earth, and let  all peoplesunite in a general fraternal union.     A message for the Soviet Government. On the 19th  March Lord Ourzon sent thefollowing message to M.  Chicherine :      With  reference  to  your wireless  telegram of  the  23rd  February,  the Britishgovernment is not in a position  to guarantee the immunity of M.  Litvinoff when, in finland or Scandinavia.                                                 .     The British government learns that you allege that Raskolnikoff and Niniuk arekept in irons and are  being  ill-treated.   This allegation is entirely without foundation.Both men are in excellent health and  have no  complaint to  make.   They are  keptseparate from other  prisoners and are allowed to take exercise,  to  smoke, and. toreceive literature.   The  reprisals which the Russian Bolshevik government threatensto take on British subjects in Russia for the alleged ill-treatment of Raskolnikoff andNiniuk would consequently  be  wholly  without excuse.   If such reprisals should betaken, or if the treatment of British prisoners in Russia does not immediately improve,the British  government  will hold  the leaders of  the Bolshevik movement in Russiapersonally  responsible for the maltreatment of any British prisoners in their hands.Raskolnikoff is still awaiting a reply to  his telegram stating the  terms on which theBritish authorities are prepared, to  exchange him and Niniuk.NORTHERN  TERRITORY.     Claims against the Allies. On  the 16th March Mr. Lindiey reported  [No. 155&quot;)that in order to arrive at the justice of the claims of Russian subjects and  the Russiangovernment against -the  allied military  authorities, an allied  claims commission wasbeing set up in Archangel.   It would consist of British, French, American, and russian military representatives,  and would work  on  the same lines as similar commissions inFrance.    The rules which would govern its  procedure were as follows :-      1.  The findings would be final as  between claimants and the allied governments.     2. If the commission should  reject a claim, the claimant might bring an actionagainst the  Russian government as if  Russian troops only were concerned.  The allied military authorities would in that case furnish  the Russian authorities with all relevant information, and no liability  would attach to the allied governments.     3.  The allied  governments  had no liability for damage or loss caused by acts ofwar.   Such liability rested solely on the Russian government.     Mr. Lindiey went on to say that the presence of American and French officers wasnot, strictly speaking, necessary, as the  United States government  had not agreed tobear any of the general  expenses  of the. occupation, and the French government  had agreed that we  should bear them  entirely in the first instance, subject to adjustmentlater.  But he thought  that on  general grounds the  presence of these  officers was desirable.   It  was agreeable  to the Russians,  and the absence of Americans might givethe United States government additional reason to hold aloof later.     The Anniversary of the  Revolution. On the 1 8th March Mr. Lindlev telegraphed[No. 160] as follows :-    There  was  held  on the  12th a meeting of  tbe town  duma to celebrate the-anniversary of the revolution.  The members of the -government did not attend, as theyhad learnt that violent speeches would be made.   The. president, a  socialist  member,Opened the meeting with a thoroughly patriotic speech, but was followed by some others who complained of the reactionary policy of the government and called for a proletariatdictatorship and a class war.   M. Ivanoff, social-revolutionary member of the constituentassembly, denounced such ideas as Bolshevik.    A further meeting was held on the  L4th  March, at &apos;whic&apos;h  a  vote  of censure waspassed (I gathered by a snatch vote) on the mayor (sic) and  officials of the duma, who-have resigned  in consequence.  As  a result of the first meeting  three members  havebeen arrested; arms and hoards of food were found in their offices.       [756]-383                                                       B 2
     In discussing the matter the governor-general informed me that he considered the demonstration  to be  an  organised plot connected  with  the declaration  made  by M. Chernov and some  other  social-revolutionaries in  Moscow about  the middle  of February in favour of no longer resisting the Bolsheviks.  There is as yet.no sign that the arrests will give rise to serious trouble.   The new  Russian army is doing well, and has fought  creditably  on several  recent occasions.   Cases  of  desertion have been very rare.     My  United States colleague  was much  upset  by the  arrests and  warned the governor-general that the  American troops would not remain here much longer, and that he should1 do all he could to  consolidate the position of the government before they left.. I myself doubt the wisdom of the government,  but do not  feel sufficiently acquainted with all the facts to condemn it. THE  SOUTH.     TheNeedofanA.mnesty.-On the 10th March  Mr. Cooke transmitted [No. 189] a message dated the  6th  March [No. 19] from Mr. Reilly in regard to the attitude of General Denikin towards officers who had served under the governments of the Hetman, the Bolsheviks, or Ukraina ;  an attitude  which was of so irreconcilable a character that it was necessary  to bring  it to the notice of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  as  it produced a  very  large contingent of malcontents which was  ready  to  enter any combination detrimental to  the volunteer army  whose  prestige  it  was undermining. This was  especially noticeable in Odessa.     Officers who had  served under the Bolshevik  or Ukrainan governments were court- martialled and  had to take  the risk  of degradation,  hard  labour, or death ; for those. courts but rarely j^aid any attention to motives.    Recently Generals  Bolkhovitinof and Nossovich were degraded to  the ranks, after they  had  served  with the  Bolsheviks for the &quot; education of revolution  purposes&quot;;  the  former  had rendered us considerable services in Moscow  and  had been awarded  the  British military  cross.  If an officer happened to be caught fighting with the Bolsheviks he was, generally speaking,  shot.     Mr. Reilly said he had discussed the matter with various generals, and  it was their unanimous opinion that a suitable declaration should be made and  some sort of amnesty granted by Admiral Koltchak and General Denikin.     Mr.  Reilly further said,  in  regard to the officers  who were serving  in the Bolshevik armies, that  the greater  number   of them  did  so  either to  save their families from  hunger  or under compulsion;  and  an  easy  way  out should  be found for them.   It was quite  conceivable that if those officers felt that  an ignominious death for themselves  would follow the  victory of their opponents,  they  would  at the last moment overthrow the Bolsheviks and, grasping  all power,  bring about another civil. war of which the issue would be very doubtful.LITHUANIA.    Invasion by Polish Troops. On  the  10th  March Sir Horace Rumbold reported[No. 421] that the Lithuanian press bureau at Berne had issued an official communiquestating that,  without having  notified  the  Lithuanian government, Polish troops hadinvaded the south-western  part of the former government of Grodno  as far as Bialystok,Volkorysk, Skydel, and Slonim.  As this district had always belonged to Lithuania downto the  partition, and as the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants (of whom  71 percent, were Orthodox and 14  per cent, were Jews)  had  repeatedly expressed  their desireto belong to Lithuania, and had sent representatives to the council of state and to the lithuanian provisional government, the latter desired to register  an energetic  protest against this Polish invasion, to  repel which they would take every step in their power.THE CAUCASUS. ,    Attitude in  regard  to Great Britain,- Mr. Stevens telegraphing from Batum on.the 3rd March [No. 4, received the 15th March] reported that a slight decrease of anti-British  propaganda  had been  perceptible ; the  Georgian  press  had  adopted  a lessunfriendly tone, and some incorrect statements previously made in regard to the actions-of our representatives had been withdrawn.    A  new Republic. On the 6th March  Mr.  Stevens telegraphed [No.  5] that the newspapers  had  published reports of the formation of a new republic with Lenkoran as its  centre and seat of government.   The population  comprised some 25,0.00 Russiansiind the same number of Tartars.  The government  was  a coalition of Russians and
Tartars, the  supreme  authority  being in the hands of an executive committee.   Themilitary force of,the republic was exclusively Russian, though there was a supplementarymilitia, half Russian  and half Tartar.   The object of the republic  was said to be the suppression of anarchy together  with resistance  to Tartar brigandage in  the  Zuvanmountain district and to Persian raiders in the Lenkoran district.                                    TURKEY.     The new Grand Vizier. Admiral Webb reported on the 9th March [No. 499] thathe had received a visit from the new grand vizier, who appeared to be  animated by avery sincere feeling in favour of Great Britain whilst, as was only proper, he sought todo what was possible for his country.  He several times reiterated the assurances hehad already sent privately that, after God, the hopes  of himself and  his master,  the sultan, were centred in His Majesty&apos;s Government, to whom he desired the  message tobe sent.   Admiral Webb added that he understood that his past reputation was quitein accordance with tbe sentiments he now professed.     Arrests. On the  11th  March Admiral  Webb reported&apos; [No.  529] that on  theprevious day the government had effected the arrest of some twenty  persons, amongwhom  were a former grand vizier and other ministers.                                      SYRIA.     Trade Prospects.- The War  Office  &quot;Summary of Information&quot;  for  15th  March[No. 815] gives the following notes on the trade prospects of Syria taken from a letter,written in  December  last, by a (?) French  firm  in  Syria to one  of its houses inEgypt:-     Beirut before the war was the principal port for Syrian trade, but will, in future,have to reckon with  competition from Haifa, which is the natural outlet for the exportof cereals  from  the  Hauran.   Probably, too,  Haifa will capture  the  traffic in  goodsdestined for.east of the Jordan, which were sent formerly  via Beirut  and Damascus.Beirut, however, is   not likely  to  lose  in  importance, as  the - development  of  the lebanon  and of the Bekaa valley  in  particular will  more than  compensate for  any-traffic lost in other ways.  Djeneh not  being suitable as a port for the  Lebanon, Beirutwill, in fact, probably serve the whole district from north of Haifa to south of Tripoli.     Damascus has a tram and electric-light service, but neither gas nor  telephones,whilst the water supply is indifferent.  The  town will probably lose in importance as a trade centre, owing to  the diversion of traffic from Beirut to Haifa, but an increase inthe area under cultivation round Damascus may partly compensate for this.     Aleppo  has no  tram,  water,  gas,  electric  light  or  telephone  services.  Beingcentrally situated  for  Syria, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia, and with Alexandretta  as a port, Aleppo may easily become a great trading centre.   Money is abundant, owing tothe enormous profits made by  Aleppo merchants  during the war in  trade with enemy countries.  Cereals,  butter, skins, dried  fruits,  wool, cotton, and sesame will again be exported when conditions become normal.     It  is probable that in the Lebanon the  cultivation of mulberry  trees will, to acertain extent, give place to an  increase in fruit growing for export, and  some culti-cultivators  are already replacing mulberry trees with orange groves.     Sugar-cane is grown on a  small scale, but only for eating raw, as the percentage of sugar is insufficient to justify its use in sugar  making.                  ?     The writers think that the untrustworthy character of Syrians in general will makeit difficult for Europeans to  deal direct  with either producer or consumer, and  thatconsequently a middleman will always be necessary.     They further recommend their  firm to study the question of coal-mining.in Syria.There are several districts in which  coal exists, but  the most promising is the existingmine near  Bhamclun on the  Damascus road.  The  Germans installed a light railway from the mine at Ras El-Harf to the main line, and  although the quality of the coal ispoor, it was used during the latter part of the war to supply tbe railways.   The writersbelieve that by sinking deeper a better quality of coal will be found.     The Syrian Party in Egypt. On the 14th March. General Clayton reported [No. C5,received the 19th March] that the Syrian party had decided  to  approach America,  andhad  submitted  the following  demands  to the American  consul  for  transmission to
Mr. , Wilson;:  (1) That&apos;. there should: be  an undivided Syria&apos;&apos; bounded  by the  Taurus-mountains, the Arabian, desert, the Sinai desert,: and the Mediterranean.   (;2.): That itscomplete independence should be declared by the peace conference, and that the  UnitedStates of America should be delegated to assist it.  (3!)-That politically it should&apos; bea federation of states (each  independent  as  to  its internal  affairs) with a  centraldemocratic government.   (4.)  That the laws of personal status should be  preserved.(5.)  That religion should be entirely independent of the  government and  its  policy.(6.) That there should be only  one language for the whole country and that Arabic.     Petitions from the Bekaa Valley. On the 15th March General  Olaytrm reported[No. 73] that  the Arabs of the Bekaa valley had put in protests against the inclusionof their district in the French Lebanon.                                    ARABIA.     King  Hussein  and  Ibn  Saud. On the  12th March  Lord  Curzon  informed sir  Milne Cheetham [No. 323] that instructions had been  sent to  Baghdad cancellingthose of the 26th February [E.R. CIX, p. 4] in deference to the opinions of the political officer at that place, General Clayton  and  Sir  Reginald Wingate, after consultationwith the last mentioned  and Mr. Philby.   The result was that it  was now  consideredthat  the time had come to make a more definite pronouncement of our intention tosupport King Hussein against Wahabi aggression.  At  the same  time this should bedone in a manner which would not preclude Ibn Saud from acquiescing with a good grace.The political officer had therefore been authorised to send Ibn Saud a letter in regard tohis  subsidy  informing him that this would  in  any case  be reduced  by one-halfin  view  of  the   alteration in  circumstances since  it  was  granted;  it had  been allowed  to run   on  at  the full  rate  for some months to facilitate  demobilization.The letter went   on to  say that  the  British  government  felt grave  concern atthe reports of impending hostilities with King Hussein, the security of whose kingdomit was bound  to  protect against attack from any quarter.   It regarded  the Ibn Saud&apos;sattempt to extend his authority to so far  distant a spot as Khurma to  be ill-advised,and felt that the establishment of Wahabism there would be a direct menace to  Hejaz:therefore it gave him the friendly advice to modify his attitude and that of his followers.He would realize that his readiness to  fall in with  this advice must be  a condition for continued  support; and the British  government felt sure that  he would  take thisfriendly warning in good part.HASA.     Spread of Wahabism. On the 9th March the political officer at  Baghdad reportedthat he had received  a message from  the  agent  at  Bahrein, informing  him that theIkhwan movement was making rapid progress and had already reached Hasa.
