The executive committee of the communistInternationale  sent  out  the  following  wireless  message  from Petrograd  on  the22nd April :-     .... bourgeoisie,  we form a  Red army which will  liberate the whole world fromslavery.   Down with the rule of tsars and kings !   This cry was first heard in 1917 inRussia and has echoed throughout Europe.  Nicholas Romanov, Wilhelm Hohenzollern,Karl of Austria  and other more or less important executioners have been  overthrown..Down with  the  rule of capitalism !  This call is still  heard.   The workmen  of most countries are just  beginning  their second revolution, when they will rise  for the second time and fight their last decisive battle.   This rising will be our war-cry on the 1st May,.the workmen&apos;s holiday.  Last j^ear [?] .... It has  been partly carried out  in the soviet republic, and now the  workmen  of  these  countries,  where soviet authority has gainedthe upper hand, demand a six hours working day  and declare  a struggle against  thebourgeois militarism.   In order to  defend this old  1st  May demand we  form our Rednational  army, which is  an army of labour, an army of the poor, an army of socialism.This army  already exists in Russia,  Hungary, Bavaria, and Austria,  will  soon  be formed  throughout the world,  and will gain the  final victory.  &quot; Down with  theimperialist war ! &quot;  This was  the cry last May-day of the workmen of the whole world.Down with slaughter,  which the imperialists of the Entente wish to inflict on the sovietrepublics of Russia and  Hungary.   Long  live  the civil war,  the only righteous war inwhich the oppressed classes carry on the&quot;struggle against their tyrants.   Honour compelsthe workmen of the whole world to start  an immediate  rebellion against the bourgeoisgovernments, Avho are striving to crush the already  established  and the future sovietrepublics in Europe.   Down  with the French imperialists and with the bourgeoisie ofthe Entente.  Down with the brigands who wish to send their troops to Russia,  in orderto restore the monarchy and  the power of the land-owners and the bourgeoisie.     French, British, American, Italian, Serbian, Roumanian, and Polish  workmen andsoldiers,  turn your bayonets against your  bourgeoisie your enemy is in  your own countries.  Raise a rebellion in the rear against your bourgeois governments.  Willthey dare to send you to suppress the Hungarian and Russian revolution ?   German
 and Austrian workmen, turn your bayonets  against  your own bourgeoisie, who are in the power of the Social Democrats ; lighten the  birth-pangs  of the  communist  revolu- tion.   It is entirely in your power to save your country from tbe hardships of starvation and unemployment, which was brought about  by your bourgeois generals and Social Democrats.     Polish,  Lithuanian, Esthonian, and Finnish workmen  and soldiers, your  own bourgeoisie and the imperialists of Germany  and the Entente  are setting  you  against the great Russian republic.   Remember that.the Russian  soviet  federal republic.is uniting all toiling masses without regard  to nationality.  The bourgeoisie wishes you to forge your own fetters.  We  call upon  all to join the  street-fighting ou May-day. Swear that you will  fight for power and liberty  in your own cormtries.   The fire  and the storm of the proletarian  revolution will break out  throughout  Europe.  The moment expected  by our  teachers and foreseen by  the great  founder of socialist theories is approaching.   The  best people  ....  fighters for  freedom and martyrs ....  the time has come to avenge ourselves on. our oppressors.   May 1st, 1919, must become the day  of  the proletarian  revolution  throughout Europe.  The idea  which  made the bourgeoisie  tremble with fear 30  years ago can  be  made  a reality at present. Under proletarian watchwords  the  international soviet republic  must  defend  the Russian,  Hungarian, and Bavarian, soviet republics.  Long live the International Red ! ..  . . Let all the toiling masses in every European city join the  street demonstrations in May-day.  These  demonstrations must  spread  to every town and village.  Let  the European bourgeoisie  bear   the  repeated cries, &quot; Down with  capital.   Long  live communism  !&quot;  Let the. workmen firmly hold the rifles  which the  bourgeoisie forced them to take up in 1914.     &quot; All workmen armed, and the bourgeoisie  disarmed.&quot;  This must  be the  watch- word of the day.   Fighting which took place in  vaidous countries can be considered as outposts&apos; skirmishes between labour and capital.  - The forthcoming great battles are to decide  the situation.   Europe is  filled with  the sound of the voices of  the indignant proletariat, who are longing to join the struggle.   In various  parts of our planet slight earthquakes  are taking place.     By storm, bloodshed, tears, famine, and endless suffering, a. new  world, the glorious world  of communism &quot;and of general fraternity among the toiling masses, is to be created. In 1919 the great communist Internationale was  formed, in  1920 the  great inter- national soviet republic will be established.     Long live  the 1st of May ! NORTHERN TERRITORY.                      :     Invasion of Russia  by Finnish troops. On  the 28th  April  Mr. Lindiey reported [No. 263] that he had just  received  a  note  from the  minister  for  foreign affairs informing him that Finnish troops had crossed the Russian frontier near Lake Ladoga.     Such action was a breach of the assurances  given by the  Finnish government to. the allies.     The minister  for  foreign affairs had addressed similar  notes to the  other allied representatives.  In a private letter he laid stress on the  necessity  of coming to some understanding with the  Finnish  government, and inquired as to the attitude of his majesty&apos;s government towards the Finnish invasion.     In another telegram sent on the same day he said that in discussing the question with the minister for foreign  affairs, the latter had said that he would welcome Finnish military co-operation against  the  Bolsheviks on three conditions :      1.  That the  frontier should be  considered as  absolutely unchanged politically, however much the  Finnish troops  might violate it in the course of operations.     2.  That the Russian civilian administration should remain wherever it still existed, and be  installed in place of the Bolshevik administration wherever the latter was now in power.                                    -     3.  That  Russians  desirous  of crossing  from Constantza  into  Prussia should be allowed to do so,  and not be compelled to make a  long  and costly journey through Scandinavia. UKRAINA.     Bolshevism. On the 21st April. Lord Acton telegraphed [No. 686]  from Berne asfollows  :      A Russian Jew who was formerly private  secretary  of M.  Witte  states that hehas just learnt from Ukrainan..6fficial sources that in the opinion of the present govern-
merit Ukraina  will  become  entirely Bolshevik unless the Entente takes  immediate measures to prevent it.  There is  a danger that M.  Vinnitchenko, whose  Bolshevikconnexions are notorious, will overthrow the present regime.   Change of regime can be prevented by the official recognition of  Ukraina  by the Entente and  by  the  lattercalling upon the Poles immediately to cease hostilities against it, both parties submitting to  the  arbitration of the peace conference.   This solution would give Ukraina a  well-disciplined army  in  a  position  to  fight  the  Bolsheviks.  A second army  would  be composed of one  hundred thousand Ukrainan prisoners  in Italian hands who wouldrequire clothing and ammunition.  The  informant learnt from the same  source  thatthere were over one  million  Ukrainans in the United States who would be ready to- beenrolled in.  the same cause.   M. Wasilko is  coming  to  Berne to treat with all thegovernments of the world, and the representatives  of the Entente should enter intorelations with him.                                                                 !     The above message, which  is  written in  German,  is very  corrupt.  The writerencloses a memorandum by Professor Stephan Tomaschiessky, attached to the Ukrainanspecial diplomatic  mission in  Switzerland, of which the following is a summarj&apos;-:      The western  portion of  Ukraina is still free from  Bolshevik influence, although ithas behind  it another  bitter enemy in the shape  of Poland, who avails  herself of theBolshevik oppression of Ukraina in order to extend her new frontiers as far as possiblein  an  easterly direction.  It follows from  this that  if the  Ukrainans  had  not  been compelled to throw their principal military forces  against  this  Polish  pressure from thewest, the country would never have been overrun  by the  Bolsheviks to  the presentextent;  consequently,  as soon as  the  western  frontier no  longer needs militaryprotection, a national  military movement against  the Russian  Bolsheviks  will  have complete assurance of success.   It must  be remembered that the theory of Bolshevismhas never been congenial to the Ukrainan national character, for the simple reason thatin  Ukraina those  class differences  which lead to proletarian unrest  do not exist  ;and furthermore, that Bolshevism represents to the Ukrainans nothing more than a, new form of Russian imperialism  striking at the south and putting its tentacles over thecoveted regions of Ukraina.   It is indispensable for the success of  a  military offensive on  the  part of the  Ukrainans  against  Bolshevism that the  western  powers shouldnot  only recognize without delay the ethnographical boundaries of the Ukrainan state,but that they  should also take pains to dispose of the prevailing conviction that it wasGermany  alone  who  was  ready to  support  the  Ukrainan  claim  to  political independence.     The  memorandum  then  follows the same lines as  the  document quoted at  thecommencement of this  telegram, and states  that  should the allies  induce the Poles to cease from  hostilities  immediately,  the  Ukrainans  would be  disposed  to  enter  intoimmediate peace negotiations and to assume full responsibility for the protection of thePolish  minority in Ukrainan territory.   Similarly the Rumanians must  be induced bythe allies to evacuate the Ukrainan regions of the Bukowina.     Lastly  the writer  advocates the theory on behalf of his government that Englandalone can lend support to the claims of Ukraina, and that a  British protectorate over that country would be  welcomed with enthusiasm by the whole population.   The causeof the  failure of France to gain a foothold in Ukraina is easily  explained by the Frenchfeelings of amity  both for  Poland  and  for imperialist Russia, as well as by the paltryinterests of France on the shores of the Black Sea.  ...     Your lordship  will,  of  course,  observe that  the  suggestions  made in  the  first paragraph of this  telegram are practically identical with those which  have reached thislegation more than once since the  beginning  of this  year from various Ukrainau andRuthenian representatives in this country, such as M. Stephankowski and M.  Paneyko.SIBERIA.     Professor Pares on  the General Situation. On the  23rd April,  Mr. Robertsontelegraphing  [No.  301] from  Vladivostock,  transmitted  the following report,  datedChita,  14th  April,  which  he  had  that  day  received  by messenger from. ProfessorPares :      I  have given six lectures in Vladivostock, five in  Harbin, and two here on theattitude of England towards Russia&apos;s present position.   Very large audiences  wereattracted  by  this subject, chiefly because they hoped to hear of more definite action tobe taken  by the British government in connexion  with Russia.   A typical comment of
&quot;the Chita newspapers  is, &quot; this was all very interesting, but we had hoped for some-thing more.&quot;     Here I have  had three discussions, for  information, with  a group  of the local military staff,  with leading citizens. summoned by the civil governor, and with theprincipal  representatives of the co-operative movement.     The  military  made it perfectly  clear that  the)&apos;&apos; felt  that there  had been norevolution; they were not at all ill-disposed to England, and the  present  misunder-standings could  I  think be easily removed and  forgotten;  but they have no  ideasbeyond the old regime, of which they  have established (? a)  (group undecypherable)here.  They rule the district by force, and their rule is politically quite  unintelligent.Japanese  influence is  paramount  here.  It is, however, to  the good  that  GeneralSemenov, who  is  a real force  in combating Bolshevism, has   apparently acceptedsubordination to Admiral Kolchak.     Civilians are evidently divided into  two groups.   (?  A few), including the Cadets,have  quite  forgotten  that they formerly  stood  for  representative government,  andhave thrown in  their lot with the military.   This group constantly and particularlyreproaches England with Mr. Lockharfs mission.   Others, including some Cadets andall of the Left,  which represents the  mass of the population of Siberia, see that theJapanese connexion is an adventure endangering the union of classes and the integrity of the territory in Russia.   In this  second  group the  most  sensible political talk wasthat of  the  Co-operators,  who  are all to the left of the Cadets.   They  detest theJapanese for their (? Pacific) expeditions, and lean  on England and  America,   In this district over 90 per cent, of the burgher population and 80 per cent,  of the Russianpeasants are Co-operators, and aie loosely associated with the right wing of the socialistrevolutionary party.   The Co-operators are all for a commonsense economic   policy, with ho  other  immediate  policy  except (two groups  undecypherable) representative and elective institutions, which they seem to control everywhere in Siberia.     They are entirely favourable to such an allied policy  as I have outlined in previous telegrams, and  are themselves proceeding  on  those Hues.   There is no other element which can claim to represent Siberia, and I am convinced that any attempts to  impose the old regime here wdll have but a short-lived success.  When asked by me to  review the relations of the allies, the Co-operators  complained that Japan could never  supply the economic needs of Siberia.   Their  attitude to Germany is not one of boycott, but they place economic independence in the forefront of their policy,  and  therefore rely mostly on England, which they are convinced is the  most  disinterested of the allies, and the  most desirous  that Russia should be strong and self-supporting.     They desire the recognition of financial credit, good transport, agricultural  imple- ments, electrical engineering, &amp;c, and they believe that at  present Germany  cannotgive such help.  They have in their official congress definitely condemned Bolshevism as entirely  destructive;  and in my talks and lectures I had no difficulty in speaking most plainly in this sense.     They greatly resent the indifference to public support shown by Admiral Kolchak&apos;s government, especially (? labour) and more particularly they condemn the Riuov policy of attack on all representative  institutions,  which   is doing greatest  harm, and  is only (? a nuisance).   This policy is also prosecuted by  General Semenov in  Chita.  They in no way object to the recognition of (? Admiral  Kolcbaks) government by us as  long  as it is conditional on his taking  a broader public basis,  which would  be  the more likely if England took a  hand in the game here.     Detailed Tartar information from Ufa, Volga, and Kasan pictures  the Bolshevik government as already  collapsing, its  railway transport in a (group  undecypberable) desperate state, and consequently also the supplies of food.    The Tartar of the  Volga has the  same  political  attitude  as that  of the  Co-operators  above  described.  The Japanese adventure cannot  influence  the reconstruction of  Russia, otherwise than adversely, beyond Irkutsk and in European  Russia.   Colonel Hulton and  I had a complete and intimate explanation of  the whole of the position with General Semenov, who announced that all misunderstandings  between himself and Admiral Kolchak were settled in principle.   He also  said that he stood absolutely for the  union of all  forces capable  of working for  the reconstitution  of an independent Russian union ; he saw a great danger to Russia in the separate  action of individual allies.   He  obviously wishes that the joint  allied action shall  continue, and,  in this connexion, is anxious  for the goodwill of England.     He  subordinates himself as  an energetic local and individual force, not  only to Admiral Kolchak, but  also, in advance, to an all-Russian government,  including also European Russia.   He  readily  dismissed  all  personal or other misapprehensions with
regard to England or its  representatives.   I think that we must hold on to this, as Ibelieve that if properly ba,ndled he will stick (? to it).  Anyhow, he is one of the reallyenergetic, forcible, and sane-local&apos;forces, and wishes to work with us.LITHUANIA.     The question of frontiers. On  the  24th  April Mr. Grant Watson, telegraphingfrom Libau [No. 32j, reported that he had pressed the prime minister of Lithuania tostate clearly what his government  asked  for  in  the matter  of frontiers.  He hadresponded to the request and the Lithuanian delegates in Paris had been instructed.     The question of the future population of the delta of  the Niemen would be raisedofficially by the Lithuanian government, which felt that if a state composed of thechief of the  inhabitants  of  the Niemen  was to  be  formed,  it  should  include  theinhabitants  of  its delta,  who were  of  the same  stock.   Lithuania, could  have  freeintercourse with the outside world if she were in possession of Memel, and, in addition,the timber trade would be freed from  German control.  If the mouth  of the  Niemenshould  continue  to  be German, Memel,  being cut  off from the hinterland, would continue to stagnate ; and, at the same  time, the  regulation of the navigation on theriver would be  to neither country&apos;s special interest.                                      POLAND.     The Situation in Viina. According to a wireless message sent from Nauen on.the28th April the  people of Vilna have  risen against  the Bolsheviks and driven them outof the town.     A regiment of Polish Bolsheviks, known as the Warsaw regiment, which arrived from Moscow, joined the revolutionaries.   Polish legionaries also took part in the  streetfighting, but it is not clear whether the latter were brought in from outside or whetherthey had been in hiding in Vilna ever since the Bolshevik occupation in January.     Feeling in German Poland. A wireless message sent on the 25th April from Posento the Polish national committee at Paris speaks  of a marvellous national awakeningeven in those parts of Poland where national  feeling appeared  to have been stifled.under the Prussian yoke.   Numbers of protests have been received from all parts.   OnEaster Monday a huge Polish assembly was held in Danzig, so great that the germans themselves were surprised to see such a huge crowd of Poles.                                    TURKEY.     The Church  of S. Sophia.-On the  21st  April Admiral  Caltborpe,  telegraphingfrom Constantinople [No. 831], reported  that on  the  previous  day  Mr.  Hohler hadreceived a  visit from the grand vizier, who wished to discuss  the question of the futureof the church of S. Sophia.   The grand vizier spoke of it as the  most revered shrinein the whole Moslem world after the holy places, and he had  learnt that societies werebeing formed with the  object of handing it over  to the  Greeks;  the Sultan was mostperturbed, and he would be unable  to remain  in  Constantinople if it were so  disposedof.  The grand vizier further laid great stress on the effect which would be produced onthe Moslem world in its entirety were S. Sophia taken from it.   Mr. Hohler promised toask him, Admiral  Calthorpe, to inform Lord Curzon of the immense importance whichthe retention of the edifice by its present possessors held in the mind of the Sultan.     Italians at  Konia. On the 29th  April  Admiral  Webb reported [No. 897] thatsome 1,200 fully equipped Italians  had  recently arrived at Konia to the great concern of the Turkish Government.                             SYRIA AND ARABIA.     The commission of inquiry. On the 29th April the Foreign Office  telegraphed[No. 156]  to  General  Clayton informing him  that it  was hoped that the  Britishcommissioners  would be able to start before the middle of next  month.   The  commis-sioners would be Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.M.G., and  Commander Hogarth,  R.N.V.R.     League of Nations. The kingdom of  Hejaz  is an original  member of the leagueof nations.     Emir Feisal. Renter&apos;s agent  at Taranto, reports that the Emir  Feisal left  that port for the  East on a French battleship on the 26th April.
                                     PERSIA.     League of Nations. Persia has been invited to join the league of nations.     The  Christians  of  Urumia. On  the  25th  April Sir Percy  Cox transmitted [No.  305] the following joint telegram, dated the 22nd April, from  Major Eadie  and the  consul at Tabriz: We returned  to  Urumia to-day.   The feeling against the  ^ return  of Christians, and against all  foreigners  is  very  strong.    The governor  is  *$. pro-Christian but he has  no force, and is intrigued against by the local Mohamedans. We consider it to be essential that a force  of about  1.00 soldiers (Hindus preferred) should be sent to us (1) to enable the refugees to return ; i2) to  protect the remainder of the Christians, and (3) to prevent another massacre, which is possible.     The German consul at Tabriz.-Qi\ the 26th April  Sir Percy Cox reported  [No. 312] that the Persian government  had instructed its  deputy governor at Tabriz to intimate to the  Turkish and German consuls that  when the Turkish troops had approached Tabriz the allied consuls had  vacated in order  to  avoid unnecessary complications, so now,  when some British troops were on the point of coming to Tabriz, the Turkish and German representatives should take their departure in order to avoid possible arrest, and that they would be given all facilities for getting away.     The Turkish consul said  that he was ready  to leave if given a safe-conduct.   But the German replied that he had no intention of vacating, adding that he was putting his consulate into  a state of defence and would resist  to the last.  He said too that he had enough dynamite in  his  house to destroy the whole quarter in which he lived, and in the  last  resort  he would blow  the consulate and himself into  space.  He  had proceeded to place himself in a state of siege.    The Persian government  had thereupon  caused it to be intimated to him that his conduct was incompatible with the status of  a consul and that it no longer recognised him as such ; adding that the consequences  of i his  refusal to evacuate must be on his own  head.   At the same time  it was  arranged through the Spanish  minister for a telegram to be sent to him from the  German charge d&apos;affaires, saying that no harm to him  was intended  if he departed  quietly, and  that he should evacuate immediately. He replied that if given a formal safe-conduct by the  British government through the Persian he would  cease his present proceedings.  This  was given.   He then said he could not quit without direct  orders from Berlin ; and  this is the  present position.    Wustrow, the German in  question, was the man who was responsible- for  the deportation of the British  colony and other hostile acts at Shiraz.   It was  not quite certain whether he was now touched in the head or merely bluffing; but it was  known that his  bouse was full of munitions of war, and,  as he lived in a  closely  populated quarter next door to the Imperial Bank of Persia, that harm might easily result to his innocent neighbours if military measures bad to  be taken against him.  Two platoons, however, were being held  ready  at Nakchivan in  case of  need.    The Turkish consul had left Tabriz with his  escort without giving any trouble.                                AFGHANISTAN.    Punishment of the Murderers of the  late Amir. The &quot;Morning Post&quot;  of the 29th April says that, according to news from the frontier, the durbar held at Kabul onthe 1 3th instant to decide the fate of the persons concerned in the assassination of thelate amir Habibullah Khan  lasted from  8  in  the morning till 2 in  the afternoon.The new amir, Amanullah Khan, surrounded by his  brothers, uncles,  and.  ministers, presided.   Papers and files were  produced,  and the fate of Nasrullah Khan, uncle ofthe new amir, was  discussed.  Some advocated the  death  sentence, while  the  amirhimself recommended impLisonment for life.  The discussion finally resulted in a unanimousfinding by the durbar that Nasrullah Khan should  be  kept in gaol for life and Colonel Shah  Ali Baza should suffer death.   The latter sentence was  carried out directly thedurbar concluded.
