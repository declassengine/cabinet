SECRET.                                    TURKEY.     THE  representatives  of  the  Turkish Government  signed  at  Mudros on  the 30th October the armistice terms  submitted on behalf of the allies by  the  British admiral.   The  armistice  came  into force at noon  on the 31st October   The exactI terms  of  the armistice are only just being received, and detailed comment must be reserved.   It is enough that they  are  sufficiently drastic to enable us to dictate the terms of a rightful and enduring peace in the Near and Middle East.     History  will yet have  to determine the part played by the Committee of Union and  Progress, with its secret  ramifications in  every capital of Europe, in  luring on Germany to war and in compassing the destruction of the Ottoman  Empire so long the  cause of wars, diplomatic  entanglements, massacres, and  the misrule of many  of the  fairest provinces of  the ancient world.  Carasso, Talaat,  and  Enver have done their evil  work, and  the  reckoning has  now  to  be paid.  Armenia,  Mesopotamia, Arabia, Syria, and Palestine now enter upon a new chapter of their histoi-y.     Of more immediate  moment is the opening of the front door to Russia through the  Black Sea, and  the final  extinction of German dreams  of expansion, absorption, and  aggression in the East.   At last we  have the key of the Dardanelles  in our pocket. and  a British fleet can  lie off the Golden  Horn, not on sufferance or on invitation, but of its  own free will and  right.  The  war  in  the  East is  won, and the days when Constantinople could dictate terms to Europe are over, let us hope for ever.     In comparison with this  great event in the history  of  the  world  other matters referred to in  the Report  sink  into insignificance, and comment  would  appear super - fluous.

On the   28th  October  Mr.  Alstontransmitted [No. 195] a message from the high  commissioner who was still  at  Omsk.Sir Charles Eliot reported that a  single Government  claiming to represent  all russia would probably  be  formed  shortly,  a  result  of  the  negotiations between  the &quot; All-Russian &quot; and the Siberian Government.   He understood  that both parties had agreedthat the supreme power should be vested in a directorate of five ; and that all  provincial governments  should cease to exist, provincial autonomy however being admitted inprinciple.   A ministry, he said, was being formed  and it  was  composed  for the mostpart  of nominees of the  Siberian Government.  This  ministry would  not be a cabinet with  collective  responsibility ; its members would be  individually responsible to  the directorate.  These  arrangements were  to be  confirmed by  the Constituent  assembly which was to meet in February.  MM. Avksentiev and Vologodski both  said that thenew Government would be whole-heartedly pro-ally and anti-German, and would accept.all obligations  and treaties which had been  accepted by  the  Kerensky Government;whilst in internal matters it would favour &quot; moderate democracy.&quot;     To the carrying out of all this, the Tomsk Duma was a serious difficulty. That Dumahad commissioned M.  Vologodski  to form the Siberian  Government  and it was  now-proposed to summon it  for a single sitting to enable it to accept the resignation of  thatGovernment and then to dissolve itself: it was said that steps had been taken to  secure theconsent of the majority.  Many, however, were in favour of dissolving the Duma withouta meeting.  No  official announcement would be made about the new Government beforethe settlement of this question, which evidently aroused violent personal  feeling :  that.settlement might take some time.
NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Relations with the Omsk Government. Mr. Linrlley reported on the 28th October[No.  339 J that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had made the following  declaration inwriting to the diplomatic body :      The  Provisional Government  of north Russia, considering the northern region ofRussia an inalienable part of the All-Russian State, recognises as the southern authorityof this State the  Government elected at the conference of members of the constituentassemby at Ufa, having its seat now at Omsk,  and presided over by M. Avksentiev,and  expresses  its willingness  to obey all  orders  directly communicated by  thissouthern Russian Government until the next All-Russian constituent assembly be called together.     The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that he had  made this communication on account of a telegram be had received from M. Avksentiev, to whom  he had repliedin similar terms.ESTHONIA.     General Gonditions.-hord  Kilmarnock  telegraphed from  Copenhagen  on  the23rd October [No. 3120] reporting that he had received a  visit from some Esthoniandelegates.  From what they had told him  the situation in  Esthonia appeared  to be serious,  in  view of the strength of  the Bolsheviks, as the Germans  were sendingmaterials of war  back to  Germanj^, and even now  their force only  numbered some12,000 men.  Their rule had not become milder, but there had been no more arrests of late.  It was believed that  at a recent  secret conference  the German-speaking land-owners  had resolved  that if the German  troops  should retire  they would go withthem,  though they  had  been  making efforts   to  ingratiate themselves with  theEsthonian population.     Recognition of Independence by  Germany. A  Russian wireless message of the25th October stated that on the 22nd  October the  German Government  recognised  theindependence of  Livonia-Esthonia, and that this recognition had been communicated tothe president of  the Landtag of Livonia, Esthonia, Riga, and Oesel.LITHUANIA.     General Conditions. Lord  Kilmarnock, telegraphing from  Copenhagen on  the23rd October  [No. 3117], reported  that  two Lithuanian  gentlemen,  who  had justarrived from Berlin, had informed him that terrible barbarities had been perpetrated inthe Mohilev district  by Red  Guards, who had advanced as  soon as the Germans  hadretired ; the town of  Lepiel had been  sacked.  It was almost impossible to feed  the200,000 starving refugees who had poured  into  that part of Lithuania  which was  stillin German  occupation, the local population  being already in straits for food.  All armshad been taken  from  the  Lithuanians by the Germans, so that, on the withdrawal ofthe latter, they would be at the mercy of the Red Guards. In these circumstances theyappealed for help and protection to the Entente Powers.   -URRAINA .     New Cabinet, Renter&apos;s Amsterdam agent  reported on the 25th October  that,according to a  Kiev   telegram, the  new Cabinet  had been constituted  as  follows :Premier, M. Lisogub :  War, M. Rogosa; Finance, M.  lishepetzky ;  Food,  M. Gerbel;Foreign Affairs, M. Doroschensko ; Railways, M. Rutenko ; Public  Health, M. Ljubisky ;Interior, M. Reinbott ; Labour,  M. Slawinsky ; Public Worship, - M.  Motozky ; Justice,M-  Wjatlow;  Public  Instruction, M. Stebnitzky ;  Agriculture, M. Tschernysch or M. Leoutowitsch ;  Commerce and Industry, M. Mering.TURKESTAN.      Protest against Interference. A Russian wireless message  of  the 26th October says that  the Turkestan Central Executive  Committee on  the 23rd October issued a protest  against the violation by Anglo-Indian troops of the territories of Turkestan, and against their intervention in the internal affairs of Turkestan.  The Central Executive Committee decided that, unless British policy towards  Turkestan were modified within seven days, and  that unless the Council of the Peoples&apos;  Commissaries and  the  Central
 Executive Committee of All-Russia should issue  special instructions in the matter, the following measures should be taken : (1) All citizens of Entente countries would he placed under the surveillance of the local authorities ;  (2) All English citizens would be declared hostages until English troops  have left Turkestan;  (3) The right of property would be suspended in the case of all foreigners within Turkestan.   These measures would  not be applied to official  representatives or to foreigners who would prove their loyalty  to the councils authorities.     The  Turkestan Central Executive  Committee  awaits the advices  of the central Government, and declares that, it will employ all its forces for the defence of the socialist fatherland.                                    POL AN D.     General  situation. Lord Acton  reported  from  Berne on  the  23rd  October [No. 1948] that information had been received from Poland to the effect  that, with the intention of discouraging  Prussian Poland from forming an anarchist  State in which there would be as little recognition of the rights  of property as in Maximalist Prussia, the  Bolshevist movement  was being openly encouraged by the Germans.   The con- sequent danger was said to be a very serious one;  and  it  was urged that a  coalition Government, formed from all parties, was the only means of meeting it effectively.  But all attempts to form such a Government had so far broken down, because the  Club des Partis had  refused  to take  part  in any which  adequately  represented the  more progressive parties of the  Left, claiming that it had the support of the allied Govern- ments in its insistence on the formation of one  in  which other parties would hardly be represented.     Formation  of a National Gabinet.-R.eu.ter  reports  that, according to a Warsaw telegram, a new Cabinet  consisting of  fourteen  members  was formed  on the  23rd October.  The portfolio of Finance  and the  posts of ministers without portfolio for Galicia  and Posen had not then been  allotted.   M. Pilsudski bad been designated Minister  of War.   Of the  old  Cabinet there remained  the  Minister  of  Justice, M. Higersberger, and the Minister of Instruction, M. Ponikowski, who according to the &quot; Przeglad Poranni,&quot; had been given this  latter post purely as an expert.  The President of the  Cabinet is M. Swdeczynski:  Foreign Minister, M. Glombinski, a Galician; Minister of the Interior, M. Chrzanowski;  Minister of Agriculture, M. Wladislav Grabski ; Minister of Commerce and Industry, M.  Wierzbicki; Minister of Labour and  Social Welfare,  M. Wolczynski;  Minister of  Traffic, M.  Paszowski;  Minister of  Food,M. Minkievicz.     The new  ministers are for the most part National Democrats and members of the Inter-Parliamentary Club.   They thus belong to the political group whose attitude in the Council of State in home  and foreign political questions was  often  most  strongly opposed to the Government and its programme.     Jewish National  Council ReuteFs agent at Amsterdam reports that the Jewish Correspondence Bureau at The Hague has learnt from Warsaw via Berlin that a JewishNational  Council has  been established  representing  the  interest of  3,000,000 Jews in Poland.   The Council demands the rights of self-determination for  the Jewish  people,and  national minority  rights for  the  Jews, who constitute 15 per  cent, of the  entire population of Poland.  The Council wdll shortly convoke  a national meeting.                                   ALBANIA.     Meeting of Albanians  in  Switzerland. Lord Acton reported on the 25th October [No. 1981] that the military  attache&quot; had been informed by a  well-known  Albanian that  it had been unanimously  agreed,  at  a meeting  of the leading Albanians  inSwitzerland, to request the  sanction of the Italian  Government to the bringing under a single administration of all the liberated Albanian districts.  This it was said  would.make it clear to the whole people that the time for  active  co-operation with  the allies-had come.                                   BULGARIA,,     M.  Todoroff.-Lord.  Acton  reported on  the  26th   October   [No.  1986]  thatM. Todoroff, the minister for foreign affairs, belonged to the party of which M. Gueshoffwas  the head.   The latter was at present living  in Switzerland,  and  so was in  a      [898-119]                                                       B 2
position to  get into  touch with  the Entente;  and Lord Acton  had heard  on goodauthority that the appointment of M. Todoroff was regarded  in  Bulgarian circles inSwitzerland as  a proof that the foreign policy would really he directed by M. Gueshoff.                                    TURKEY.     The New  Ministry. Reuter reports that the new Cabinet  has made  its firstappearance  in  the Chamber  of Deputies,  and that the  Grand  Vizier, Izzet. Pasha,outlined the Governments programme as follows : -     The Government has undertaken office at  a critical moment  of our history, since our country is confronted by enormous difficulties at home and by dangers abroad, andit is conscious of the importance of the task that awaits it, as well as the degree of itsresponsibility, with regard to which history will pass judgment.  The organism  of thefatherland, which  has during the past eight years suffered from all kinds of disturbances,both of an internal and a foreign nature, and which has sustained  many shocks, at lastneeds  repose.   This  self-sacrificing nation, which took upon itself the most painfulprivations during  the four fearful years of war, privations such as no people could haveeasily  borne, at length requires rest.  Cur sole duty at present is to meet this require-ment.   In order to fulfil this duty we will, with the help of the Almighty, make everyeffort to show the utmost zeal.  We have resolved, according as circumstances permit,to have sent home those  countrymen who,  in consequence of the  necessities arisingfrom the war, have been moved from one place to  another  within  the country, and  wehave already begun to carry  out this  decision.   The movable and fixed property  ofthese children  of the fatherland, who for a year or two  have  borne  fearful  sufferings,will be restored, and  compensation for goods and chattels which have been sold will begiven them.   We have resolved to restore liberty  to those  who have  been  banished bythe order of the military administration, and to send communications in this  sense tothe vilayats.  We have prepared a bill that we shall submit to you concerning a generalamnesty for those condemned  for political offences.   The weal of the country and thetranquillity and happiness of the nation depend solely on obedience to the law and onthe punishment of those who infringe it.   We will abolish every  inequality, injustice,and  irresponsibilty, because they disturb the business of administration, and will see toit that all enjoy in equal  degree  political rights and freedom of development, and  inevery way participate in the country&apos;s administration.   We will propose the necessaryohanges in our present electoral laws in order to protect the rights of minorities.  Withregard to the Arab vilayets, we will try to  solve this  question, assuring to  them self-government corresponding to  their  national   aspirations,  on  condition that  the  tiebetween them and the caliphate, as well as the Sultan, is maintained.     The Chamber gave the Cabinet an almost  unanimous vote of confidence :  only tendeputies abstained from voting.                                   ABYSSINIA.     Proposed Reforms. Telegraphing from Adis Abeba on the 21st  October [No.  83],Mr.  Campbell reported that the Regent had expressed to Mr. Dodds  his decision to calla meeting of the chiefs to propose  the  appointment of  European  counsellors  and the-adoption of a broad programme of education for Abyssinians in Europe and  Abyssinia.He realised the necessity for early action to ensure the maintenance of the independence of Abyssinia, which must stand or fall by the decision of this meeting.                                   PALESTINE.     Position  of  Missionaries.  On the  25th October Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed  toGeneral Clayton informing him that the following memorandum was being presented tothe  French  ambassador in London :      On  the 17th November, 1917, the conference of missionary  societies in GreatBritain and Ireland presented to Mr. Balfour  a memorandum regarding the position ofmissionary work in Palestine and  Syria, in relation to  any future  government whichmight be established  in those  territories.     2.  This memorandum drew attention to the work and to the rights and establishedinterests of missionary societies in those parts of the Turkish Empire and to the claims of the British missions to have restored to them the property taken  from  them  in  thecourse of the  present  war.   The  memorandum further expressed the hope  that  the
following two principles might be laid down in any arrangement made respecting thefuture government of Syria and Palestine :      (1.) That both the  native inhabitants  of  these  countries and foreign  residentsshall enjoy full religious  liberty, and that  the followers of all  religions  shall be free from interference in the  exercise of their  religion, and  from  any  political or civildisability on the ground-of their religious beliefs or in consequence of a change of faith.     (2.) That British subjects in the peaceable pursuit of their  calling as  Christianmissionaries shall not be hindered or interfered with, and shall be at  no disadvantage ascompared with the citizens  of  other  nations  or  the followers of other creeds ; and thatBritish churches  and missionary  societies  shall  be permitted  to  acquire and  holdproperty and to erect buildings for missionary purposes.     3.  In view of recent events these principles become of immediate importance, and though the British Government assumes  that they are already recognised by ail theallied  Governments,  it  is clear  that many  difficult   questions  will  arise  in  their application.   These questions will have to be  dealt with in  the final settlement, and itwould be  well that they  should, without delay, form  the  subject of  consideration  bythe  various  allied Governments.   Meanwhile,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government has  taken steps to bring these principles to General Allenby&apos;s attention, and Mr. Balfour assumes that French officials acting in these territories under the terms of the recently concludedagreement will likewise be guided by them.     Mr.  Balfour  added that  the  administration  under General Allenby&apos;s  authority should  of course  be  conducted in accordance with these  principles so far as possible;and  requested General Clayton to report  any problems which might arise from time totime in this connection.                                      SYRIA.     The  Arab  Administration. General  Clayton  reported ,on the 27th  OctoberTNo.  146] that the Arab administration  had  been established  at  Hama  and Horns,where the Arab flag  had been raised amidst  enthusiasm.  At Nebk  Emir Feisafsrepresentative had been warmly welcomed, and speeches made in praise of him and king hussein.   The King had telegraphed urging that justice should be  administered to allclasses  without distinction, and conveying his salutations  to  all, Christian, Jew, and moslem alike.   He had  stated, too, in his telegram that the freeing  of Syria from theoppressive rule of the Turk wTas his reason for entering  into the war.     Aleppo. The War Office announced  on  the 27th  October that  our  advancedcavalry and  armoured  cars had  occupied  Aleppo  on  the  morning  of the  26th  afterovercoming slight  opposition.     Damascus. On  the  27th October General Clayton, reported [No.  146]  that thepeople  of  Damascus  talked  much  of their  newly-acquired  liberty,  and  were stillenthusiastic on the subject of Arab independence.   The declaration  of Emir  Feisal inregard to the equality of religions  and his recent visit  to the  Christian (?) patriarchshad  been greatly appreciated, and he was becoming  increasingly popular with all classesirrespective of religion.   His attitude had done much,  to allay among Christians their traditional fear of Moslem control, though there was still some natural distrust.  At arequiem for the Arab martyrs  in  the Greek Orthodox  church,  the patriarch, in his address, emphasised the difference between the conditions  of life under the  Arabs ascompared with what they had been under the Turks, and also  offered a prayer for theKing of Hejaz and his army.     The Lebanon. General Clayton reported on the 26th October [No. 1411 that therehad  been  a  genuinely enthusiastic  reception  at  Baahda,  the seat  of  the  LebanonGovernment, when Colonel Piepape took over  the administration.  At an interview withthe  remaining  members  of the administrative council of the Lebanon  and  otherfunctionaries, Colonel Piepape  had  informed them that  the status quo ante bellum wouldbe re-established, an administrative council constituted, and the district administered bya French officer.   General Clayton also said that a  scheme had been  drawn  up to dealwith the question  of relief, which, it was stated,  was required by 100,000 persons.     Telegraphing again on the following day [No.  145] General Clayton reported thatfears had been expressed by a deputation  of Druse  chiefs (which had  met the  british political officers at Beirut) for the Druse minority under the regime  about to be set up.
The deputation was assured that its fears were unfounded, and was urged  to  accept  a,good administration in the spirit in which it was given, and to banish old prejudices.The interview appeared to have  produced satisfactory results.    Message from Emir Feisal. On  the 12th October  Mr. Balfour telegraphed to-General  Clayton [Nos. 208 and 214]  instructing him to  convey to Emir Eeisal his,Mr. Balfour&apos;s, congratulations on the establishment of a humane and ordered Govern-ment in Damascus.  On the 27th October General Clayton reported [No. 147] that thefollowing reply had been, received from Emir Feisal:      My success in establishing a government in Damascus, the  capital  of Syria, was due to the assistance of your victorious armies who entered this  universal war for thelove of humanity, the freedom of the oppressed nations, the preserving of their  rights,and the lifting the yoke  of injustice from their shoulders.  I have the honour to  tendermy cordial congratulations, and beg permission to make use of your message as a means to make the Arabs, who were delivered from despotism by the aid of the  loving and.honourable British nation, look forward to a safe and prosperous future.   Please accept.my cordial respects. FEISAL, Commander of the northern Arabian armies.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     Kirkuk. The War Office has announced that, after slight opposition, Kirkuk was.captured on the 25th  October.o
