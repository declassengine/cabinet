On the 3rd April Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 329]some extracts from a secret report made by a  messenger who had seen MM.  Trotskyand Lenin some three months ago.     According to this report the two above-named Bolshevik leaders, with M. Sverdloff,form  a triumvirate  which is  the actual  Soviet  government.   MM.  Trotsky  andSverdloff worked together, but between the former and M. Lenin there was some want of harmony.   M. Trotsky was thought to be in German pay, but not the latter.     In Siberia there was an extensive Bolshevik organization,,.p3cret and well supplied with funds.   The Bolsheviks withdrew  to  foment difficulties  between the Czechs andthe Russians, as  they regarded the  former of these as their most formidable adversariesiu that region.     In European Russia though the situation was difficult their  military successes had improved it.   Just when the supplies of coal and grain were running out the capture ofUkraina  and the Don  basin replenished them ;  and  cotton  had been  obtained fromTurkestan.     The  Bolshevik army was improving : there would be at least a couple of million ofmen in the spring with  about 50,000  officers.   The  leaders recognize that  their armycould  not resist an  organized allied offensive, but they trust  to  Bolshevism spreadingamong the allies, and think that there is no chance of such an  offensive.     Sir Charles Eliot said that this message was apparently trustworthy.     A Soviet Message to England.-On the 6th April M. Chicherin informed Be\&amp; Kunthat he had just sent the following wireless message to England  and requested  him tomake it known to Americans:-     We have just learnt that on  the 6th March in  the House of Commons, Mr. CecilHarmsworth, under-secretary for foreign affairs, stated that the number of men, women,and  children executed  by the Bolshevist  government in Russia was very great, andthat the  Bolshevist  government employ a portion of their considerable Chinese forces to act as executioners.   It was also stated that  victims of the Chinese  executionershave died under  torture.       [756]-484                                                           B
     The  people&apos;s commissary  for  foreign affairs very much regrets that the Britishunder-secretary has  made himself a mouthpiece for silly rumours, which have nothing in common with  the facts.   It has recently been officially established that  the totalnumber of executions in all Soviet  Bussia during the  entire period of the existingSoviet  authority amounts  to  3,200.   The majority  of  those executed were commonbandits and looters, against, whom the strongest measures were necessary in the interestof the maintenance of order.     The large  number of Chinese troops alleged to be in Soviet Russia.is also a merefable.   A small number of Chinese have entered the ranks of the Red army from amongthe Chinese workmen in Russia and have been formed into small detachments.   Theyhave, however, never been used for purposes of repression.     As regards the alleged employment of torture, this is pure invention.  The people-scommissary for foreign aLairs protests against these false accusations, and against theseattempts to lower Soviet Russia in the eyes of other nations.     Exchange  of Prisoners. On the 1st April Mr. Bell transmitted from Helsingfors[No. 171] the following telegram&apos;from Mr. Parker :      As the  Bolsheviks  have already refused  to exchange British naval, military, and civilian prisoners in  Russia against Ras . .  : . and Nin  .... I propose to communi-cate your alternative proposal.     As the  French  are already negotiating  direct  for  an exchange of prisoners, and.conditions are very much involved and will entail much time and expense, I consider it advisable  to exclude them  from our negotiations.  We have therefore only to considerthe Americans  who are, as far as is known, six, one Italian, and a few Rumanians andSerbs.                                                                       .     I have  good reason to  believe that in exchange for all officials interned in Arch-ahgel, estimated  by  Bolshevists to be three, together with R . .  .  . and N  .  . .  ., theBolsheviks would liberate all Our; naval, military, and civilian prisoners in Russia, alsoall allied prisoners, and would  further  [? allow]  all British men between 18 and 48  toleave Russia.   There are about seventy such men now detained who wish to  get away,and many without occupation are living at the  British governments expense  . ..  . .     Food and sanitary conditions in Russia are  getting worse and worse, and some  ofour  men  are  suffering  considerably from their protracted imprisonment.   There  is,.also  the  danger of  a  complete  stoppage  at any time  of  trains  or  of politicalcomplications.  . .     The French mission is already out of prison.NORTHERN TERKITORY.     A  popular Assembly  summoned. On the  7th  April Mr.  Lindiey  reported[No. 210] that  he had learnt that the provisional  government  recently had a telegramfrom Prince Ivov impressing on it  that assistance from the allies to the non-Bolshevistgovernments depended  largely  on  really democratic   forms  of government   being established in their areas.     Presumably  in  defere; ce to this advice the  provisional  government  has issued adecree summoning representatives of the zemstvos and towns to deliberate on taxation,municipal finance, unemployment,  health, food  organization, and free trade, and  toreceive from  the government reports on  currency, judicature, and departmental work.     Representatives are to  be elected by the  zemstvos and the town councils from among  their members.   Archangel town will have eight, other  towns  seven, and thezemstovs thirty-five.     The assembly will meet for two weeks at the beginning of May.     Invitation to the Bolsheviks to leave. -On the 3rd April Mr. Lindsay reported [No. 199]that the Russian [? commander-in-chief ] had published a notice inviting all those withBolshevik sympathies to apply in writing before the 10th April for leave to proceed  tothe interior.  Such applicants, provided they had not been convicted of criminal activities,would be guaranteed safety across the  line and three days&apos; provisions.    After the10th April all who were convicted of adhesion to the Bolsheviks or  of sympathy with soviet rule  and criminal activity in those directions would be dealt  with by a specialcourt-martial.  The  notice did  not apply to anyone in prison.     It was not expected that any would avail themselves Of the invitation, which wouldprobably be regarded as  a trap.
UKRAINA.     Relations  of the Soviet Republic  with  Foreign  Powers. The  following  is  asummary of an exceedingly mutilated message emanating from the Italian  consul atKieff and addressed to the Italian minister for foreign affairs :      The president of the Ukrainian  Soviet government, M. Rakovsky, called together on  the  29th March,  and again on the  1st April, the consular  representatives  offoreign  powers at Kieff.   He informed them  that they occupied privileged  positions and enjoyed exceptional advantages, in spite of the  fact  that none  of them hadpresented letters accrediting them to the Ukrainian Soviet government.     M.  Rakovsky  asked the  consuls to furnish him  within  ten days, ue ,  by the11th April at 6 P.M., with an answer to the following three questions :      1;  Will their governments  consent  to  recognise officially the socialist Ukrainianrepublic of Soviets ?     2.  Are the consuls officially authorised to exercise their consular functions ?     3.  Will their governments consent to accord to the representatives of the UkrainianSoviet republic free entry to their territory for  the purpose of exercising their  functions as representatives of the Soviet republic ?     Message for the French Government. The French  government was  informed  byM.  Rakovsky by wireless message on the 8th April that, in consequence of the shooting ofcommunists at  Odessa, the executive committee of the Kherson government had decidedto intern as hostages representatives  of  the bourgeoisie and the  independent whiteguards,  and to shoot ten of them for every workman or peasant shot at Odessa.     Evacuation  of Odessa. The  allies  have evacuated Odessa; and,  according to a bolshevik wireless message the occupying Soviet troops are under the command of theHetman Grigorieff.SIBERIA.     The Kolchak  Government. On the 5th  April   Sir  Charles Eliot telegraphed[No. 338] his opinion as to the present position of the Omsk government.   Till a coupleof months  ago, he said, he had regarded it as uncertain, but during that time  it had, in western Siberia, become more popular and more stable : but in Eastern Siberia, thoughit was not exactly unpopular, it was regarded by the non-Bolshevik population as some-what distant and little  known.    There was no sign of any personality or organizedmovement  likely to supplant Admiral Kolchak, and the recognition of his government by  the allies would materially strengthen the cause of  law and order by  the  authority and prestige which would result from it :  and such recognition would  also  have  an excellent moral effect on the approaching military operations.     As to  the  attitude  of  our  allies, that  of the Americans bad varied  considerably,but the French had always been favourable to  the Omsk government, and at  presentthe Japanese seemed disposed to supp rt it, as  was  shown by their conduct in regard toGeneral Semenoff, whom they practically forced to  offer terms to Admiral Kolchak.TRANSCAUCASIA.     Condition  of the Armenian Population. The following appeared in the &quot;MorningPost&quot; of the 10th April :. From Armenian sources Reuters agency learns that the news from Transcaucasia continues to be of a most disquieting character, indicating that  thecondition  of the Armenian population  is desperate.   Enver Pasha,  who joined  theTartars  in Transcaucasia after  his flight from Constantinople, is known to be hatchingfurther plots against the Armenians.   Famine and  epidemics are reaping a rich  harvestin the country, the stock of medical  necessaries is exhausted,  and many doctors havedied.   The situation implies the decimation of the  only existing  compact  mass ofArmenians by  Turco-Tartar attack and  the cutting off of communication between  theErivan&apos; government and Turkish Armenia, thus  preventing  the return of  Armenianrefugees to their homes.   Armenians  hope that  the British command in Transcaucasiawill intervene in time.LITHUANIA.                                                                   -  .... Lithuanians and Poles. On the 5th April Sir Horace Rumbold reported  [No. 587]that the  Lithuanian  press bureau  at  Berne had stated that  it had  been ofEciallv        [756]-484                                                       B 2
 authorized to  deny the statement made in the press to the effect that the Poles had occupied Grodno.   This town was, it stated, in the hands  of the  White Russian and Lithuanian troops, who were determined to defend it against  the unjustified aggression of the Poles.     Change  in  the  Provisional Constitution. Reuter&apos;s  Stockholm  correspondent reported as follows on the 8 th April : The Lithuanian  press bureau here has issued the following statement from Kovno :      At  its sitting of the 4th April the Lithuaniarr  state council resolved to alter the provisional  constitution of  Lithuania in such a way that  the  supreme  authority  is transferred  from the  president of the state  council to the president of state, who will be subject to election.   The state council, will, however, continue as a legislative body. The  council  then  elected as  president of state M.  Antanas Smetona,  the present president of the state council.                                    POLAND.&quot;   &apos;  Proclamation  of Martial  Law. Telegraphing from  Warsaw on  the  3rd  April, Mr.  Kdmens reported [No. 5] that there had been a proclamation of martial law  for a period of three months in the territory which formerly belonged to  Russia.                                    TURKEY.     A Warning from General d&apos;Esperey. On .&apos;the  26th  March  Admiral Calthorpe reported [No.  636] that three days earlier the grand vizier had called on Mr. 11 older, to whom he had shown a note  from General  d&apos;Esperey warning him  that the Turkish government would be held  absolutely responsible for any disorders or massacres in the Aidih vilayet or elsewhere.   The grand vizier regarded  this as unfair treatment.   The Greeks, he said, were intolerably provocative ;  and a very dangerous situation resulted from the mutual  fear and  distrust  which existed between  them and the Moslems. Added to this was the chaotic condition of finance and administration resulting from f ur years&apos; war.  His government was doing everything in its  power to prevent disorder, but the only practical  thing to do was to  invite the British  government  to place posts at such points as might be necessary.     Two days later Admiral Webb telegraphed [No. 651]  that he  understood that the grand vizier meant to reply  vaguely that he was  applying for assistance from the allies, though the responsibility fell at the least in an equal degree upon the Greeks.     The Arrests. On the 3rd  April Admiral Webb reported [No. 677] that he proposed not to request  the surrender of the  persons who had been arrested on his demand, as they appeared to be kept in much  safer custody;  he  should, however, continue to obtain more arrests.  He had not asked for any to be  made on purely political grounds such as having caused the war, though  General d&apos;Esperey had  done so.  With two exceptions, the persons w hose arrest he had demanded had been guilty of  brutality to prisoners. As for the massacres, to punish all who  had  been  guilty would,  he said, necessitate wholesale execution of Turks.   He had only  demanded the  arrest  of two deputies, but he had caused a list to be communicated  to the  Turkish government, and many of those whose names were on it were now in prison.     On the 4th April Reuter&apos;s agent  reported from Constantinople that  the police,assisted by the allied gendarmerie, continuing the search lor the  men implicated in the armenian massacres,  have just  made several important arrests, comprising Halil Pasha,uncle of the notorious Enver Pasha ; Alif Bey,  known as &quot; the assassin of Angora &quot; ; andJemal^Oghuz, one  of the sinister personages of the  C.U.P.                                     SYRIA:     Effects of tlie Egyptian Troubles. On  the 4th April General Allenby reported No. 497] that the Egyptian nationalist movement having taken a religious turn, under^he influence of El Hazar, Syria and Palestine were being affected, and that  there wasvery real danger in the situation.                                                /                                  KURDISTAN.    Anti-British and  Anti-Christian Inttigues. -On the 7th April it was reported from Baghdad that.reports had been received of intrigues in the Kurdish tribal areas in
 sthe district of which Jezireh ibn Omar was the centre.  Disturbances had taken place  at the end of last month in  the Goyan country, which lies to the north of Zakho at aJ  distance ot some 30 miles.   And on the 4th April Captain Pearson, assistant political , officer at the last-mentioned place, was murdered in the Goyan village of Karoar  as  he  was proceeding from Bilu to Mergi.                                      PERSIA.      The Shahs Visit to Europe. On the 28th March Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 180], . to Sir Percy Cox informing him that he was&apos; prepared to  waive his objection to the.. proposed visit to Europe, if the Shah, before leaving  Persia, gave  Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  full powers to conclude any arrangements which might be arrived  at after negotiations  between the two governments,  he hafi^ already accepted the general lines of such an  agreement.;  and further undertook not to visit Paris during the sittings of the conference,  and to abstain from all intrigue.  Lord Cufzon added that he thought it would be  better that the prime minister should not accompany the Shah as it would be preferable. for the negotiations referred to above to be conducted in Teheran.      On the 5th April Sir Percy  Cox reported [No.  249] that the Shah had come  to the  decision not to visit  Europe before the autumn, as the weather would  be too hot  for.  travelling by the time he had  made  his  preparations  for the journey, and had come to  an understanding with us on the matters now under discussion.      -The Minister  for Foreign Affairs, On the 27th March Lord Curzon telegraphed  [No. 178] to Sir Percy Cox, informing him that the Persian minister had called on the  previous day  and  had  stated that  the Persian  minister for foreign affairs desired to  come  to this country to consult him [Lord Curzon] regarding the case to be put forward  at the  peace  conference.  He had  replied  that he  would gladly see  Mushaver-ul-i Mamalek, but that  his visit  would only be of use  under one or the  other, of two  conditions :-      1.  That the Persian delegation, if  it received no satisfaction in Paris either  as the  result of being heard by the conference or as the result of not being heard at  all, should  come  to us and ask tor advice.      2.  &apos;! hat Mushaver-ul-Mamalek should substitute  a visit here for an appeal to the  peace conference and give up hopes of the latter altogether.
