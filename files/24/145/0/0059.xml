The present condition  of the Bolsheviks. On the 5th May Lord Acton reported from Berne [No. 770] that M. Lenin had issued instructions to his agents in Switzerlandto the  effect that a supreme  effort must  be  made  in  that country before the finalcollapse of the Bolshevik movement, which in view of its failure in Bavaria and hungary and  the impossibility of propaganda in Italy and  France was imminent.  Lord Actonsaid  that he had acquired this information from an  &quot;absolutely reliable authority.&quot;     Russia and Ukraina  versus Rumania. On  the 1st May the following wireless message was sent out from Moscow :-     MM. Chicherin and Rakovsky, the  respective commissaries for foreign affairs of theRussian and Ukraihan soviet governments,  have requested Bela  Kun to forward a note to the Rumanian government at Bucharest.   The note states that when there existed asingle Russo-Rumanian front, Ptumania treacherously invaded Bessarabia at the end of1917, and there restored the power of  the landed proprietors.   Rumania stated at thetime  that  the  occupation  of Bessarabia  was purely  provisional  and  dictated  byhumanitarian reasons.   The annexationist designs of the Rumanian government weresecretly supported by  the  Entente governments.   Thus, on the 21st February, 19 1.8,Fasciotti, the accredited Italian  diplomatic representative of the allies, informed theRussian  soviet  that the intervention  of Rumanian  troops  in Bessarabia was purely amilitary operation, undertaken  solely for the  purpose of re victualling the Russian andRumanian troops and the civil population of the country.     On the 5th March, 1918, the  Rumanian  government  signed an agreement withRussia,  the first article of  which  stipulated that Rumania should evacuate Bessarabiawithin  two months.   Rumania  also engaged  not to undertake  or support militaryoperations against soviet Russia.   These engagements  have  not  been  fulfilled.  The
Rumanian government have supported the German armies in their aggressive movementsthrough  Moldavia and Bessarabia against Russia, and Rumania has become one of the centres  of the  Russian counter-revolution, supporting with  every  means in her power the. Russian White guards and others.     In  Bessarabia the Rumanian  government has  employed  its  usual procedure ofexploitation and rapine  against the peasants and  workers of all  nationalities andreligions in that country.   (Here follows a  long list of atrocities  and acts of violencealleged to have been committed by the Rumanian  government in Bessarabia.)     Peeling their authority tottering, and foreseeing that the workmen and peasants ofRumania would soon rise in revolt, the Rumanian  government  is trying to strengthenits power at the cost of fresh crimes, and propose to overthrow the power of the Sovietsin Hungary.   Hitherto the Russian and  Ukrainan soviet governments  have contentedthemselves with protesting  against acts of violence on  the part of  Rumania towardsthe workers and peasants  of Bessarabia, but now they can wait no longer. Not wishing to shed the blood of the Rumanian workers and peasants, who have been compelled bytheir masters to march against them,  the two soviet governments address the following proposals to the liumanian government:      1. The immediate evacuation of the  whole of  Bessarabia by the Rumanian  armies           and agents.     2. Trial before a popular tribunal of the authors of the  crimes committed against           the Bessarabian population.     3. Restoration to Russia and Ukraina of all military property seized by Rumania.     4. Restitution to the inhabitants of Bessarabia  of  all that has been taken from           them by Rumania.     The Russian and Rumanian soviet governments will await for 48  hours from 2 P.M.on 1st&apos; May a  clear and  definite reply  as regards the  adoption  of their proposals,otherwise they reserve to  themselves complete liberty of action.     Four days later  M. Chicherin sent a wireless message to Bela Kun asking if he hadforwarded the Russian and Ukrainan ultimatum of 1st  May to  the Rumanian govern-ment and if it had been received at Bucharest.   M. Chicherin stated that M. Rakovskyhad  sent another  ultimatum to the Rumanian government, demanding the evacuation of Bukovina, which  ultimatum expired  on  4th May at 2 P.M.   On 5th May Bela Kuninformed M. Chicherin by wireless that both  Bucharest and Nagy Szeben (Hermann-stadt) had refused to receive the wireless message.   He  stated that it was clear thatthey had received  it, but  did not wish to acknowledge it.  [This  apparently refers tothe joint ultimatum.]     Protest against Finnish military action. On  the 28th April the  following wireless message  was despatched from Moscow :      Yesterday the people&apos;s commissary for foreign affairs, M. Chicherin, sent a wireless message  to the Finnish government at  Helsingfors, in which he pointed  out that, inspite of the repeated statements that soviet  Russia had no hostile intentions towardsFinland, tbe Finnish  government  had  begun  military operations against the soviet republic.  The regular Finnish troops had  crossed the frontier of the  Russian soviet republic, and had started  operations  in  the Olonets district.  Messages from Englishwireless stations left no doubt that the Finnish troops were operating in conjunction withthose of the  Entente.   In  districts invaded by  the  Finns, the latter  armed thereactionaries and exploiters and devoted their energy to destroying  the achievementsof the Russian revolution.   The workmen and  peasants of Russia clearly saw that theFinnish government, in sending Finnish  workmen  and peasants to new battlefields v/asforcing  them   to  shed their blood.    The  imperialist governments of the Ententecountries who were supporting the authority of the Rumanian nobles,  and were sending the Rumanian people against revolutionary Ukraina  and revolutionary Hungary, were doing everything possible  to support the parties of extreme  reaction in  Poland, andwere once more forcing the sons of  Poland to shed their blood  in fighting  against tbeneighbouring soviet republic. .  The  Entente governments were supporting  the german counter-revolutionaries  who were  sending  their  troops against  the  Lettish  soviet republic.  All the  governments of the Entente were helping the present government off inland  in its military operations against the workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; Russia, in spiteof the peaceful  intentions, of  the Finnish. people.   Soviet Russia would not  lay downher arms until she had secured freedom and the achievements of the revolution.
     Exchange  of Prisoners. On the  25th April Mr.   Archibald  Parker sent  thefollowing wireless message from Moscow :      To-morrow,  on the  25th  April, all British subjects  now in  prison  will  beliberated and subjected only to domiciliary  arrest.   MM.  Raskolnikoff and Niniukmust also  be  liberated on  the same day  and  subjected to domiciliary  arrest.   in exhange for MM. Raskolnikoffand Niniuk, and on promise to release as soon as possibleM. Struiski  and all those taken near Reval, together  with Raskolnikoff, the sovietgovernment  will give  us  the whole  of  the  Caucasus mission,  and  Messrs.  fraser,Bryde,  Muspratt, Howard, Copesteak, and  Vice-Consul Home,  seventeen persons inall- that is  to  say, all those now in prison.  This exchange is  to take place at  theFinnish frontier not later than the  5th May.  MM. Raskolnikoff and Niruuk are to besent to  Copenhagen and there  taken in charge by the  Danish  Red  Cross, who  willaccompany them to the Finnish  frontier.     The remaining British prisoners  are to be  exchanged as soon  as possible withall soviet officials  and  sympathisers  of Soviets  now  detained  at  Archangel  and murmansk, and the region  of  Baghdad,  Persia,  Turkestan, Transcaspia,  and   the families  of  soviet  commissaries  murdered at  Baku.   The details and the place ofexchange are to be agreed upon separately.   The soviet government  asks permission to send  a  Russian Red Cross  representative, accompanied by a  Danish  Red Crossrepresentative,  to Archangel, to  verify that all  soviet officials have really been freed.When this later exchange takes place, all British male  subjects, between the ages of eighteen and forty, now detained in Russia will be allowed to leave in  the  usual way.Please inform the  Danish Red  Cross, and  instruct  Mr. Bell, Helsingfors,  to make arrangements for the transit through Finland of MM.  Raskolnikoff and Niniuk,  andof our people.    Send  Mr.  Bell  also permission for the nurse, Soda Blumenthal,Russian subject, to accompany our people to England, as some of  them need attention.Telegraph  when  MM.  Raskolnikoff  and  Niniuk will   leave  England  and reachRussian  frontier.     The alleged Nationalisation of  Women. On the 1st May the following wireless message  was sent out from Petrograd :                 &apos;     The Russian  official news agency, Vestnik,  publishes  an  indignant denial of the story circulated  in the &quot; capitalist  press&quot;  concerning the nationalization  of women,which has  found  such  universal credence.   This &quot; infamous calumny,&quot; says Vestnik,originated from  two sources : (1)  a telegram from a correspondent of the &quot; bourgeois &quot;paper &quot; Searja russia&quot; [sic], who stated that in the town of Chwalynsk, in the govern-ment of Saratoff, a certain  woman named Federowa, had published  a scheme in thelocal  paper  advocating compulsory marriage  of women,  and declaring that similarschemes  were already in operation in the towns  of Luga  and Kolpino.   (This, Vestnikstates, is a  pure invention.)-  (2) A paragraph  in the newspaper &quot; Swoboda Rossii &quot;stating that news had been received that an anarchist group  in Saratoff had adopted a resolution  advocating the nationalization of women.  Both these stories were treated by the  newspapers  concerned  as comic  anecdotes.   One can only marvel, Vestnikconcludes, at the malevolency and credulity which have made the successful circulation of such  nonsense possible.NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Recognition  of the  Omsk Government.   On the  3rd May Mr. Lindiey  reported[No. 281] that the.provisional government had informed  the diplomatic representatives that it  had  decided  on the 30th April  to  recognise the Omsk government as  thenational  provisional government of all Russia.   Pending the establishment of direct contact with the  Siberian government  and receipt from  them of detailed instructionsthe provisional  government would carry on as hitherto.     On  the  following day Mr.  Lindley  telegraphed  again [No. 284] saying that itwould be advantageous from  the&apos; local point of view if his majesty&apos;s government could see its way to recognise Admiral Kolchaks government as the provisional governmentof Russia in districts administered by it and by those who recognise its authority.     From. Sir  C. Eliiofs telegram No. 338 it appeared  that  this would also ease thesituation in  Siberia.  It  would certainly  weaken Bolshevism  everywhere,  and  heventured to  urge its immediate consideration.     The Finnish Invasion  [E.R.  CXVIII,  p.  2].-On  the  5th  May Mr.  Lindiey,telegraphing from Archangel, reported [No. 285] that the  acting minister  for foreign
 affairs had made a further  protest against the Finnish invasion, saying that he had learnt its  object was  the  annexation of Russian territory from the district of Lakes Ladoga and Onega to  the White Sea.   Mr. Lindley added that he had heard indirectly that the real instigator of  this invasion was the French military mission at Helsiugfors, which seemed to him probable. SOUTH RUSSIA.     General Denikin&apos;s Aims. The &quot;Times&quot; published the following in its issue of the 5th May :      General Denikiri has issued  a. message to  the allied missions  asking them  to inform their respective governments  of  the aims of the command  of the armed forces in  southern Russia in their struggle  with the  Bolsheviks.  These  aims,  signed  by General Denikin and the members of his special council, are :      1. The destruction of  Bolshevik anarchy and the introduction of law and order.     2. Reconstruction of a powerful, united, and indivisible Russia.     3. Convocation of a peoples assembly based on universal suffrage.     4. Decentralisation of power by means of a wide  regional autonomy and liberal            local self-government.     5. Guarantee of full civil and  religious freedom.     6. Immediate agrarian reforms, with a view  to  meeting demands for land by the            working-classes.     7. Immediate labour legislation,  securing the working-classes  from exploitation by            government or capitalists. SIBERIA.     The Americans and the  Railway. On the  29th April Mr. Robertson transmitted [No. 403] a telegram sent from Omsk by Mr. Hodson. The latter said that information had been  received at  Omsk to  the effect that the railway between Yokkniudinsk and Irkutsk was to be guarded by Americans.  This  decision of the allied military committee was not unfavourably  regarded  in  Omsk : it  had apparently been made without any consultation with the Siberian  government.   He  had been  informed  by the  minister for  foreign affairs  that an  energetic protest was  inevitable.  The  attitude  of the Americans in the Far East served  as a direct  encouragement of the Bolsheviks and other  elements  hostile to the government, and they must be held responsible  for the present disturbed conditions.     On the 2nd May Lord Curzon telegraphed to Lord Reading [No.  1090] informing him that reports had been  received from vladivostock to the effect that General Graves had announced that he was responsible to no one but  himself for the section allotted  to America, and that he would  only take instructions from his own government.  Coupled with his apparent sympathies with Bolshevik tendencies and his refusal to allow Russian forces  to operate against the  Bolsheviks who were  threatening the Suchan  mine area, his attitude seemed to indicate a  reluctance to co-operate effectively in  the scheme for the  reorganization of the railway.                               e     The attitude of the Japanese. On the 28th  April  Mr. Alston telegraphing from Tokio, reported that prior to Mr. SomervihVs  departure for Siberia he and Mr. Alston himself had been sent for by the  minister of war.   The last mentioned expounded the Japanese policy  in  regard to Admiral Kolchak and  General  Semenoff,  the object  of Japan he said being to re-establish law and order throughout Siberia under the form  of government, whatever that  might be,  most likely to bring  about those  conditions; not, as  was imagined by the  Americans, to restore  Tsarism.  Japan he said was suspected of trying to establish her power  from Lake Baikal to vladivostock  and consequently of being opposed to  the sending of General  Semenoff&apos;s troops westward  tojoin Admiral Kolchak.   On the contrary, the  Omsk government was warmly supported by Japan, whose one wish was to bring General Semenoff and Admiral Kolchak together. That this should be clone was considered of the utmost importance by the minister  of war, and there were already signs that the general was becoming  more amenable ; should this not be  the case  Japan would withdraw its support  of every kind, material and moral, from him.   The fall  of the Kolchak government would reduce Siberia once more to a state of anarchy.
                                    POLAND.    Relations with Lithuania. The following wireless message was sent from Warsawon the 2nd May informing M. Paderewski that General Pilsudski, the Polish commander-in-chief,   had issued  a  proclamation  to  the inhabitants  of the  grand-duchy  ofLithuania, in which, he stated that the Polish army  was coming to free the Lithuanianpeople from the  oppression of their government.  He  wished to give them theopportunity of deciding their internal  affairs without pressure from Poland   He wasnot setting up  a military  but a civil government, to which he would summon theinhabitants  of the country.  The  aim of this government  would  be to enable thepopulation to give expression to their  desires and their needs  by means of delegateselected without pressure from  outside; [? elections]  would take place on the basis  of universal  suffrage.  General Pilsudski stated that he  had  appointed  M.  GeorgesSmoloski  chief of  this government,  and  application was to be made to him  or  tothose designated by him in  all questions concerning the welfare of the country.    Poland and Danzig. On the same day M. Okecki [? acting] minister for foreignaffairs, informed M.  Paderewski  by  wireless that  the  Polish diet had unanimouslypassed a  resolution declaring  that  an indispensable condition of the independence ofPoland was not only the possession of the mouth, of the Vistula, and of  Danzig with  a sufficiently wide littoral, but also the possession of the whole territory traversed by therailways  connecting Warsaw with Danzig.   The resolution declared further  that therestoration to the Poles of  these territories, forcibly taken from them by Prussia, wasnot only an act of historical  justice, but a guarantee of  a durable peace based on theleague of nations.    A Polish University for Danzig. Reuter&apos;s Paris agent reported on the 30th Aprilthat the Polish  national committee had announced that the inauguration of a people&apos;suniversity at  Danzig would take place on the 2nd May.  There  were, he said, 30,000Poles in  Danzig, for whom  up  to the  present it  had been impossible  to  pursue anystudies  either&apos; elementary  or   advanced  in  their  mother  tongue.   Eight  hundredstudents had^already inscribed  their names at the  university.     The Poles of Upper Silesia. According  to a  wireless message, sent from Warsawon the 2nd  May, the Posen  papers had published  a proclamation of  the  Poles of UpperSilesia protesting against acts of violence  on  the part of the Prussian government, anddeclaring the wish of the  inhabitants of Prussian Poland  to belong  to the  Polishrepublic.                                    RUMANIA.     Objects  taken from  the Dobrudja  Museums. On  the  22nd  April  the  charged&apos;affaires at Bucharest reported [No. 261] that the Rumanian government had appointedProfessor Bogdan of  the  Rumanian Academy to proceed  to Sofia and place himself in communication  with  the officer commanding the allied  troops in Bulgaria, in  order-to be put in possession  of the Slavonian  manuscripts  belonging to  the  academy.M. Teodorescu, M. Metaxa, and M. Marineano had  been appointed to take possessionof the archaeological documents belonging to  the museums of the Dobrudja.  The charged:affaires added  that he had reminded the Rumanian government&quot; of the  note  addressedto it, to  the effect that the  question of the restoration of art treasures  had  been.referred to the peace delegates.                                     GREECE.     Italians at Salonika. On the 30th April, Mr.  Russell, telegraphing from Athens,transmitted  [No. 247] a message  received  from  Salonika to  the effect that it was anoticeable fact that the Italian  forces  in  that place  were as numerous  as ever, thoughthose of the other allied forces had been  rapidly diminishing for  some  time  past.   Tothe great irritation of the  Greeks,  strong Italian pickets patrolled the streets  everyevening.  Meanwhile all  Italians  crossing the Struma were searched  and the Greekguards outside the Italian military establishments had been doubled.  Mr. Russell addedthat  he had been informed  that fresh Italian troops were actually arriving.     He  further said that the Serbs  had stopped  near  Monastir  Italian  lorriescontaining arms  and ammunition for distribution  to comitadjis, and that Italian rifl.had frequently been found on captured Bulgarian  comitadjis.  That the  Italian milit  e mission at Soli a actively encouraged operations against both Greece and Serbia was the conviction of the Greek authorities.
                                    TURKEY.     The aegean islands now in the hands of Italy. On the 29th April Mr. Russell,.telegraphing from  Athens  [No. 245], reported that passengers arriving  from Rhodeshad brought  the news that  on  Easter  Sunday the  clergy in all tbe islands  hadproclaimed their union with Greece, a proclamation which had  been  enthusiasticallyreceived by the  people.   The Italian authorities had,  they said,  taken  repressivemeasures resulting  in bloodshed  and the loss of life.  The minister of foreign  affairs had told him that the government was doing all it could  to restrain feelings of indig-nation against Italy;  but the news, he said, had had a painful effect.     The Italians at Konia  [E.R. CXVIII, p. 5]. On the 2nd May  Lord Curzon tele-graphed to Admiral Webb [No. 751] that the peace delegation had arranged the sending of Italian troops to Konia.   This  had been done at the instance of Baron Sonnino.  Thetroops so sent were under the command of General Milne, and formed part of his  force.     Anti-Greek feeling  in  the  Aidin  Vilayet. On  the  29th  April Admiral  Webbreported [No. 909]  that  he had  been informed  by  Commander Dixon that  shouldSmyrna and the Aidin vilayet go  to the Greeks he was convinced that the Turks wouldmassacre them wholesale, especially in the country and outlying villages, so intensewas the  anti-Greek feeling.   Commander Dixon&apos;s knowledge  of  local feeling was atonce sound and reliable ;  till recently he  had been acting as senior naval officer and thehigh commissioners representative at Smyrna.o
