APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXIL                                     RUSSIA.     THE  Russian situation shows  some hopeful tendencies.   The  attitude  of the Government is undoubtedly changing in outward appearance, and the formation of an army in which officers are to  command irrespective  of the wishes or decisions of their subordinates is being proceeded with.   M. Trotsky&apos;s statement in regard to Armenia is promising.   We must not expect too much, however.                                     TURKEY.     Little  faith  should be put in Jemal ;  he is the tool of the Committee, and used only to maintain a balance to Enver&apos;s power.                                    PALESTINE.     Attention is drawn to the orders given by the Vatican regarding the formal honoursto be paid to M.  Picot, and Cardinal Gasparri&apos;s explanation.                               RUSSIAN TURKESTAN.     The accounts from these  parts are interesting ; it is suggested that these eventsindicat3 a want of accord between the Pan-Turanians and the Bolsheviks.                                     PERSIA.     The so-called  Syrians referred  to are the  Nestorian Christians of  Hakkiari inKurdistan.   Mar Shimun is their hereditary Patriarch.  They  are a  very small nationalsect, but warlike and brave.   They have no connection wi.th Syria.                                                                         M. S.     April. 1, L918.

The Position  of the Bolsheviks. Mr. Lockhart in a telegram despatched on the30th March [No. 58] said that the Bolsheviks held their position more by the energy oftheir leaders  than on   account of  any  widespread  popularity,  but  it  was  obviousthat at present they could only be ousted by anarchy or by  a counter-revolution basedon German support.  Whatever harm they had done to Russia, they were now the forcein the country most opposed to Germany.  They realised that they must either perishmiserably or fight  German militarism : the failure  of  their  foreign  policy  had been abitter shock.     Bolshevik Attitude  towards the Allies. Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed  on  the   27thMarch [No. .48] that there had been a complete change of attitude towards the allies onthe part of the Bolsheviks;  but M. Trotsky was still much preoccupied in regard to the siberian situation.  The official Bolshevik press had that day published an account ofalleged counter-revolutionary activities  in Eastern Siberia in which M. Pichon, brotherof the French  Minister for  Foreign Affairs, was said to have  taken part.     In regard to the press, Mr. Lockhart also  said that whilst  the bourgeois paperspublished  in full  the German  communiques about the great battle  on the  western front, the Bolshevik press suppressed them entirely, and printed the British and Frenchones at full length.     The Intellectual Classes. Telegraphing on the 30th March [No. 58 j Mr. Lockhartsaid that the intellectual classes were in a state of complete apathy  in regard  to  theircountry&apos;s  fate:  they bad lost their morale, and  would, with relief, welcome  Germanintervention-hoping that, after all, the allies might be victorious in the west.
     Anarchist-Monarchists. Mr. Wardrop telegraphed  from Moscow  on  the  25thMarch [No.  121]  that the  house  in  which  Mr, Jerram (a consular assistant)  and lieutenant Reid lived had been occupied by anarchists, who seized everything belongingto the Russian owners, but touched nothing belonging to the two  Englishmen, whom they treated with  great politeness.   Mr. Jerram reported that the majority of theseanarchists were  educated men.   He conversed  with a number of them, one of whomtold him that he had joined the anarchists believing it to be the only way of overturningthe Bolsheviks without German help ; another, a guardsman,  said he had joined themby order of  the monarchist party who wished to have agents everywhere.   Mr. Jerramhad come to the  conclusion that there were many ex-officers in the anarchist ranks.     The Neiv Army. In a telegram dated the 27th March [No. 48] Mr. Lockhart saidthat  M. Trotsky  was conducting  his  army  campaign with  great  energy;   andMr. Wardrop, telegraphing from Moscow a summary  of press news on the 27th March[No. 127], said that large numbers of formei military  officers had  joined the new army as instructors.  Telegraphing again on the 29th [No. 134] Mr. Wardrop said that therewere two parties in the Soviet.   One, headed bv M. Krylenko. insisted on the electionprinciple for officers and wide powers for the committees ; whilst the other, M. Trotsky&apos;party, preferred  that the officers  should  be  nominated and  the  functions of thecommittees  be limited.   The latter had prevailed.  Some members of the supreme.military council had demanded that an army should be formed by compulsion, but themajority doubted whether such a proposal would be favourably received by the people.     The Reports  as  to German Prisoners in Siberia. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed  inregard to this subject  on the  31st March [No.  59].  He said that Captain Hicks hadbeen to Siberia with an American officer to investigate it, and at Irkutsk  had met theAmerican military attache at Pekin, who had  been  sent.for  the  same purpose.   Themain  features of  Captain Hicks&apos;s report, which he said would be forwarded, were  asfollows :  There  had been hopeless  exaggeration in regard to  the activities of german prisoners of war  in  Siberia.  A few  Austrian  Socialists, who  had  renounced  theirnationality, had been armed to act against Semeuoff, whose forces were mainly composedof Chinese.   There were no German officers concerned ;  they were kept under strictguard.  Captain Hicks had  also reported that there was no danger of the siberian railway lines being seized by  prisoners of war.     Russia  and Roumania. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed  on the  28th March [No. 53]that he had  been informed by the Minister for Foreign  Affairs that an understanding-had  been arrived  at  with the  Roumanian Government, which, however,  they fearedwould not  adhere to  its  terms.  The Russian  Government was  forming  a special commission  to liquidate the  whole matter, and as they wished the allies to be repre-sented on it. they asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would send a representative.The Minister for Foreign Affairs had spoken very warmly of Colonel Boyle&apos;s services  inregard to the, understanding which  had  been reached.  The Russian Governmentsuspected a secret understanding  between  Germany  and  Roumania  relative  toBessarabia.     The Archangel Stores [E.R., LXI, p. 2].  On the 27th March Mr. Balfour telegraphedto Mr.  Lockhart saying, in  regard  to  the stores at Archangel,  that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment was quite ready  to negotiate with M.  Trotsky, but thought that  he should give instructions forbidding the removal for the present this as a mark of good faith.It appeared  to His Majestyfs  Government that the stores were in  less danger&apos;of falling into enemy hands, pending the formation of the  new army, if left  where they were.     The Knights  of St. George and the King. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed from Jassyon the 26th March fNo. 266]  that the council of the knights of St.  George on theRussian front in Roumania had voted a resolution  that King  George  should be askedto accept the third class of that order for the determination and valour of the british forces in prosecuting the common cause.   General Tcherbatchef  had informed him ofthis resolution, and he therefore submitted it, although the Russian front would sooncease to  exist, and until there was a legal Russian Government the (? star) could not  beactuallv given.     In the  days of the Empire the procedure  for  the  bestowal of  this decoration was,he had been informed, as follows : There was  a council  of the knights of St. Georgewith  each  Russian army on active service, and  it was only on its recommendation
that the Emperor bestowed the cross.   Even in the  case  of the Ex-Emperor, who wasa member of the fourth (? class), it was only at the  request of the general council ofthe knights that His Majesty (group undecipherable) the cross.     Sir G. Barclay added  that  he had  been informed that similar  resolutions hadbeen passed by the council for the offering  of the decoration  to the Kings of Itoumaniaahd Serbia, and the King of the Belgians.                                    SERBIA.     The Prime Minister on the Situation. Sir 0.  des Graz telegraphed from  Corfuon the 30th March [No.  44]  that in the Skuptchina  the  Prime Minister had that dayreviewed events  since its last meeting in 19 16,  and  had  made  a declaration  of theforeign policy  of the Government.     He alluded  to Austro-Hungarian intrigues  and calumnies in  spreading  falserumours in the West  that Serbia  had  approached the Austro-Hungarian Governmentwith  a view to a  separate peace.  In same way on the Salonika front  the Austro-Huugarian Government was. he said, spreading rumours that they were disposed to.end the war with Serbia, but that  the King of Serbia  and  the  Serbian Governmentstood in the way.     The object in the first case was to shake  the  faith  of the allies in Serbia, and inthe second to produce dissension amongst Serbians themselves.     The Serbian nation  had remained faithful to its allies, who were shedding their bloodfor small and weak  nations,  and would not change its attitude till  the end.     This part of declaration was warmly applauded.                                                                     i,                                    GREECE.     The Ex-King&apos;s Allowance. Lord  Granville  telegraphed  on  the  26th  March[No. 263] that on the previous day M. Venezelos had replied to an interpellation in theGreek Parliament regarding the Greek officers who had landed in Morea from an enemy submarine.  He gave the substance of their statements, proving that they had beensent from Goerlitz as emissaries of the Ex-King Constantine to collect information oil thestate of affairs  in  Greece.   One  of them carried  a letter in invisible ink for  KingAlexander.  M.  Venezelos said  that  the  Greek authorities had been unable to  obtainpossession of this letter, but that they were absolutely certain  that it had  not reachedKing Alexander.  As a result of this statement, the Budget Committee had decided torecommend the refusal of an allowance to King Constantine, while some of its members had  proposed to reduce King Alexanders  civil list.     Real   Attitude  of  the  Greeks. Sir  R. Rodd  telegraphed  from Rome on the29th March [No. 265] that  a prominent  persouage who had opportunities of knowingthe facts had  told  him that there were  many small  Italian  traders  in Greece from whom good information had been obtained as to the  state  of the country, and he believed that  the majority of the  people  still  favoured King  Constantine.  Also that .German agents  were making  them large promises to  induce them  to refrain fromfighting, and it was their principal object to avoid doing so.                                    TURKEY.     Notes from. Constantinople. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne  on the 8.0th Match [No. 456] that Jemal  Pasha was openly obstructing  the Germans, against whom he  had entirely turnedhe was trying to get leave to visit Switzerland.   Jemaland  Falkenhayn each considered the other responsible for the  Gaza  defeat.   Theantagonism between Enver and Talaat had reached  a  very  acute stage ;  and  he was informed  that it was now  certain that  the latter had  encouraged the Yakoub Jemalplot.  Two days earlier Sir H. Rumbold had telegraphed that  Mouktar  Bey had leftBerne for Constantinople.     Turkey and England. Sir H. Rumbold, telegraphing on the 30th March [No. 453],said that he had received information of a conference held  at  Berlin  in January lastbetween &quot;representatives&quot; of Germany,  Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, the  Crimea, theCaucasus,  and Turkestan ;   the business  was the discussion of the best way to attackEngland at the most vulnerable points in the East, and a very ambitious programme wasthe result.       [898-89]                                                        B 2
                                   ABYSSINIA.     Development of the Country. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the   % 26th March [No.  443] as follows :      A  syndicate has been  formed under  the name of the Fanti Syndicate, and  is sending  out two representatives  to  Adis  Ababa  to discuss  with the  Abyssinian Government, with a view to encourage the agricultural development  of the western highlands, to promote the importation ,of European  implements, and to negotiate for mineral concessions.     The syndicate asks for  the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in  obtaining leave from the Abyssinian Government  to  survey  railway lines from Adis Ababa to Gambela and to the northern end of Lake Rudolph.   It would  send out at  once for this purpose an  engineer with  African experience.   The  syndicate  includes Messrs. Pauling, who have constructed many railways in Africa.     The promoters  of the  syndicate   are  well  informed  regarding   conditions  in Abyssinia, and have been duly warned as to the uncertainty of the political outlook, but they prefer  to  anticipate  foreign   rivalry by  commencing negotiations during the war.     Mr.  Balfour  asked Sir R. Wingate  to  communicate this  to Mr. Thesiger, and to telegraph the observations of both.     Dismissal of Ministers. Mr.  Thesiger telegraphed on the  26th March [No. 37] that  all  the Ministers  had been  dismissed and their  posts abolished.   The Regent would  exercise autocratic power with  the  Minister  of War as adviser.  Everything was quiet.                                  PALESTINE.     French Protectorate of  the  Holy  Places.  General  Clayton telegraphed on the 28th  March  [No, 110838/6] that the  solemn entry  into the church of the Holy Sepulchre on the  23rd  March had  been attended by M.  Picot and his Staff&quot;;  to whom (in accordance with  instructions  sent from  Rome for the recognition  of the French  &apos; protectorate) the customary honours were paid.                            RUSSIAN  TURKESTAN.     Bolsheviks and Moslems. Sir J. Jordan on the 29th March transmitted [No. 294] a message,  dated the 14th March, from  the  consul  at Kashgar saying that in Russian Turkestan the Bolsheviks were all-powerful.   They had practically destroyed  Khokand in retaliation for an attempted massacre  of  Russians  by the Moslems of the town  in connection with an attempt  to proclaim  their independence.   The  natives, who were highly indignant,  talked of a religious war on the Bolsheviks, but they were powerless. The Kazan Moslems,  who, though not separatists,  were  anti-Bolshevik, so  far  had shown  no inclination  to  help  the  Khokand  people,  with  whom  they  doubtless sympathised.    Mission from Afghanistan.- See below, under Afghanistan.                                    PERSIA.    The Shah. Telegraphing on the  27th March [No.  254], Sir C.  Marling said  that the Shah was firmly resolved to remain neutral if it was possible  for him to do so; our troops were distant, and  he was much impressed by telegrams from the Sultan and the German Emperor, both of whom guaranteed the absolute independence of Persia and its unconditional integrity.    Urumia. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 31st March [No. 268] saying that the consul at Tabriz had reported the arrival of three persons from Urumia, who had stated that, in consequence of the murder  of the patriarch Mar Simon, the Syrian Christians had risen and massacred all the Moslems they could find, and had then gone, with ten cannon, towards Dilman to attack the Moslem villages.   The  town was  being policed by the Armenians, who  had tried to  separate  the  combatants.  Twenty of the more notable  Moslems were held  as hostages in the house of the Russian  general who com-inanded the  Syrian formations, and  500 others had taken refuge in the French militaryhospital.
    The mixed commission [E.R. LXI, p. 4] had not started that day, as the train hadnot arrived; it was said that it would leave on the 1st April.                                AFGHANISTAN.    Mission to Bokhara and Tashkend. Sir J.  Jordan on the 28th  March transmitted[No. 292] a message, dated 15th March, from the consular officer at  Kashgar to  theeffect that the Tashkend Government was  preparing for the friendly reception of anAfghan embassy then on its way ; a local vernacular paper had mentioned  the arrival of this mission at Bokhara in its issue of the 28 th  February.                                                                                j                        ;_,----------                    -)                          LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                     RUSSIA.     M. Trotsky and Armenia. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the  3rd  April [No. 69]that the Armenian Committee and M. Trotsky had reached an understanding ; the latter was willing  to support the efforts  of Armenia against Turkey, and would facilitate the journey of General Dunsterville.                                  PALESTINE.     French Protection of the Holy Places [above, p. 4]. Mr. Gaisford  telegraphed onthe 3rd April [No. 18] that Cardinal Gasparri had stated that the guardian of the HolySepulchre had. been  informed by the Vatican that,  pending  a definite  settlement,ecclesiastical honours might  be paid to M.  Picot.  This had been done  in deference tothe strongly expressed wish of the French Government, but did  not imply a change of attitude.  The Vatican was  of opinion that there  would be no raison Setre for theFrench protectorate after the ending of the Turkish  domination.                                     PERSIA.     The Cabinet. In a telegram  [No. 271], dated the 2nd April, Sir C. Marling saidthat the Prime Minister wished to resign : he had found it impossible to fill the places of Motamin-ul-Mulk  and  Mushir-ed-Dowleh.  This apparently indicated  that  anti-British policy did not find  support in  Teheran ;  especially when taken  in  conjunctionwith the slackening of the agitation against us.     Release of the  Captured Bank Manager.   On the  same   day,  Sir  C.  Marlingtelegraphed [No. 273] that the Jangalis had released the bank  manager and returnedhim to Resht that he might reopen the bank, which he refused to do.o
