SECRET.140APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No. XCIII.    ATTENTION  is drawn to  the attitude  of Feisal  towards the French  claimsaud activities in Syria, aud to the speech of General  Marshall delivered iu Bigdad  onthe 2nd November. .    M.  Picot and Sir Mark Sykes have  both  left Taranto for Syria ; and it is to  be hoped that some modus vlvendi with the  Arabs will be reached.    A good  deal of uneasiness has  been felt in Armenian  circles  over  the  terms  ofthe armistice with  Turkey, whereby Turkey is left in possession of, the six Armenianvilayets  during the  armistice period subject  to good  behaviour.   Recent  answers  to questions put in the House of Commons on this subject have teuded to reassure theirfears, as it is  now  made  clear  that  the  armistice  terms bear no relation   to theterritorial settle nent which  will be imposed  by the allies on,  Turkey at the  peaceconference..

In  a Foreign Office telegram [No.  2370]  sent to lord derby  on tbe  2nd  November it was suggested that in reply  to enquiries which hadbeen made in regard to the Omsk Government, it should be said that before the BritishGovernment could give a formal recognition it  must be convinced of its representative;character and of its  stability : at present, though sympathizing with the  principles onwhich the Omsk Government was based and its general aims, it was not so convinced.     Appointment of  General Horvat. Mr.  Alston reported on  the  3rd November[No. 207] that the appointment of General H or vat as  high  commissioner in the Far east of  the All-Russian  Government  had  been  announced.   His  district would  comprisePrimorskay,  Kamchatka, Priamurskaya, and  Sakhalen but not Transbaikal  for thepresent.     Bolsheviks  and the  Allied  Powers. Mr.  Ovey telegraphing from  Christiania onthe 5th  November  [No.  3938] reported  that the Minister for Foreign Affairs  had handed to him and the allied ministers a memorandum of which the following was a.        898-120]                                                              B
translation : According to  a  telegraphic report  from  the  Norwegian  legation  at petrograd, the Russian commissary for  Foreign Affairs, M.  Chicherin, had enquiredhow far the Norwegian charge  d&apos;affaires in Petrograd  would be willing to ask theNorwegian Government to promote negotiations  between the Bolshevik  Governmentand the allied Powers.  M. Chicherin  had  unofficially reported  that the BolshevikGovernment was prepared to go very far in regard to concessions to the  Entente powers with a view to arriviug at an understanding,  aud that, in this connection, lie speciallywished to have an opportunity  of entering upon  negotiations with  the  United States.The Norwegian  charge d&apos;affaires had requested the Norwegian Government to enquireif the  allied Powers would be willing to enter upon such negotiations.     Threatened Massacre of Bourgeoisie. Reuters  agent in  Stockholm  reported  onthe 29th October that a  message from  Petrograd  said that Zinoviev [Apfelbaum] haddelivered a fiery speech exhorting thousands of workmen to show real revolutionarycourage on the anniversary  of  the day  of the revolution and to  sweep away all thatremained of the White Guard and &quot; counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.&quot;   it was openlystated by Bolshevik elements that the 10th  November would  be a general St. Bartho-lomew for the bourgeoisie and intellectuals.   The panic prevailing was indescribable.WHITE RUSSIA.    Appeal for Help. Lord Kilmarnock, telegraphing from  Copenhagen  on  the 4thNovember  [No. 3258], reported that a  delegation from  the  Rada of White Russia,established at Minsk, had  requested that the following  message might be delivered toMr. Lloyd George :      On  the  approaching retreat of the German  troops from the occupied  territory,according to  paragraph 6  of the conditions  fixed by  President  Wilson, our country,embracing White Russia and Lithuania,  which for  over  three years was the theatre ofwar, will again be exposed to atrocious deeds.  Bolshevist gangs await the moment whenthe country will be cleared of regular troops to overrun it and sacrifice it to murder,robbery  and  the  destruction  of our property  and  civilization.   Through its  Rada(National Council), in which all parties and  sections of population are represented, thecountry has proclaimed its independence, which,  however, is denied acknowledgment bythe Russian  Bolshevist Government and prevented  by  force.   We therefore request the Entente as the champion of small nations and of liberty and for  reasons of humanityto protect the country from the threatening  anarchy,  and to furnish it before the retreatof German  troops  with some  military force to prevent  murders, incendiarism, andpogroms.                            [See below under &quot; Poland.&quot;].UKRAINA.    General  Situation. The allied ministers at Jassy, in a telegram forwarded  byLord Derby on the 3rd November [No.  1378]  reported that  the allied  victory andGerman peace proposals had had the following effect in Ukrainia :  The Hetman, feelinghis position to be  shaky, contemplated  a constitutional, democratic government; thepoliticians were  dismayed, but dared do nothing.  Among the people, though there wasa growing fear of the Germans, it was held  in check by the dread of the  explosion of bolshevism which would follow the evacuation of Ukraina unless the German troops were immediately replaced by those of the allies.     The Jews of Galicia. Reuters Amsterdam agent  reported on the 30th  Octoberthat the Jewish Correspondence Bureau  had learnt  from Vienna thati the UkrainanNation il Council had recognised  the Jews  of Galicia. as  an independent nationality,and would admit representatives  of the Jews into the Ukrainan Government.ItSTHONIA.     Proposed Union  of the Baltic Prdvinces. -A  Russian  wireless  message of the27th  October, stated  that  the  united  Landrat of  Livonia  and  Esthonia,  Riga andOesel, had decided  to unite the  Baltic  provinces  into  one constitutional monarchicalstate.     German Intrigue. Lord Kilmaruock reported  [No.  3207]  from Copenhagen on the31st October that the Esthonian  delegates had  spoken of a  German  intrigue which,
 according to them, was to be conducted on the following lines.   By  exaggerating  the danger of  attack from the  Bolsheviks, the Germans  hoped,  with  the help of Ger- manophile landowners and ex-officers, to create some  semblance  of a  popular mandate in favour of the elections which  had been ordered  by the nobility of the  Landtag, which elections would be boycotted by the  people, their object being to  induce  a demand  for  union  with Germany.  The  Germans  were preparing a. force of some 200,000 men, thoroughly opposed to the revolution, from among the Russian  prisoners of  war;  with this  force, which  was to be  supplied with  arms and  money,  it.was proposed  to  fight the revolutionary  forces  in the Baltic provinces, and re-establish German influence therein.   Some  of the ex-officers on whom  they had  counted were, however,  showing republican sympathies, and matters had been  thereby delayed.   A protest against this  German intrigue was being prepared by the Esthonian  delegates, who would, before long, place it before the allied Governments.     The  Question  of Intervention. Lord  Kilmarnock reported on  3rd November [No. 3243] that the Swedish Minister had. informed him that he  had been instructed to explain to tin; Esthonian delegates that they were labouring under a misappreheusnn if they had  understood that any expression of sympathetic inclination towards  interven- tion had  been made by the Swedish Mitdster for Foreign. Affairs in his communications with. them.  The Danish Minister  for Foreign  Affairs, speaking on the same subject, had informed  Lord  Kilmarnock that,  the Danish army  being for  home  defence,  it was impossible to send troops to Esthonia.   He  gathered  that the Swedish and Norwegian Governments were reluctant  to take  any action ; but,  apparently, the  latter contem- plated the possibility of permitting arms  to be  sold to the  Esthouians  by  private individuals. CAUCASUS.     Reported Murder of a  British  Vice-Consul. On the 5th November Sir  Walter Townley transmitted [No. 3891] a telegram from, the Netherlands Minister at Petrograd reporting that.he had beard that  the  British vice-consul at Astrakhan  had been shot, and that  he had demanded an explanation from M. Chicherin.                                    POLAND.     Abolition  of  Galician-Polish Customs Frontier. Reuter reports that a Warsaw telegram  to the  &quot; Rheinish-Wpstfalische Zeitung&quot; says: The  Galician-Polish frontier is now completely abolished  and the frontier guards and customs officers have been withdrawn.    Travellers can pass unhindered between Galicia and Poland.    National Army. On the 2nd November ReuteFs Amsterdam agent reported that the Polish regency council had signed a decree concerning the immediate formation of a regular national army.     Recognition of the Polish Army by the United States. Mr. Barclay reported on the 6th November [No. 4996]  that  a letter from  the Secretary of  State  to M.  Roman Dmowski, of the  Polish  National  Council, dated the  4th  November,  had  given recognition to the statu-s of the Polish army.   The following is the relevant i assage  :  This Governments position  with  respect to the Polish  cause and Polish  people could hardly be more  clearly defined than was  outlined  by the  President in his  address before congress on the 8th January, 1918.  Therefore, feeling as it does dee]) sympathy for the Polish, people and viewing  with gratification the progress of the Polish cause, this Government  experiences a  feeling of genuine satisfaction in being able to comply with your request  by the recognisation of the  Polish  army,  under the  supreme political authority of the Polish National Committee, as autonomous and co-belligerent.    Appeal  for Help against the  Bolsheviks. Lord  Acton  repotted  on  the 2nd November [No. 207fc] that  he had been  asked to transmit an appeal on behalf of the Polish inhabitants of White Russia, who were, it was stated, being  massacred by the Bolsheviks.   This had been  brought  to him by.M. Gutowski, who, was recently offered the.post of Under-Seoretary  of State  for  Foreign Affairs in the Government- Prince Janusz  Kadziwill  had tried to form, and  formerly was in the Russian diplomatic service.   According  to the  document handed to Lord Acton by M.  Gutowski, all  the Poles in the districts.of Lepel, without distinction of  age or sex, were being massacred.
Poland had  no armed  force,  and for  that reason M. Gutowski had thought it well to approach the allied Powers.  In the course of conversation with Mr. Savery, M. Gutowskihad said that the withdrawal of German troops might be looked for any day now, andif  the Poles remained  where they were without any armed garrison to protect them,extermination faced  them almost beyond doubt.   Rather than face  this,  they wouldretire at once.  Two regiments of Polish Jews, organised by the Maximalist Government,were waiting  quite  near  the frontier of White Russia;  and  once  let loose  on thecountry they would massacre every living creature they met.                        [See above under &quot; White Russia.&quot;]                                   RUMANIA.     Trend  of  Public  Opinion. On the  3rd November  Lord  Derby  transmitted[No. 1378] a joint telegram  from the allied  ministers at Jassy.  They said that theuncompromising attitude of Hungary in regard to the Austrian federalisation scheme had favourably impressed Rumanian public opinion, as  it was regarded as a justification of the Rumanian claim to Transylvania.  On the other hand,  the apprehension causedby the persistent silence of the allied Powers in regard to their obligations to Rumaniahad been increased  by the announcement that Mr. Wilson had sent a milder reply  toVienna than to Berlin.  This silence was exploited by Germany, the  suggestion being that the  allies were seeking to  treat with Hungary to the detriment  of Rumania^Public opinion had, too, been disturbed by a telegram from the French Government  inregard to the  Dobrudja.   This telegram,  which had been sent in plain  language, had, itwas remarked, given it to be understood  that Rumania&apos;s right  to this district might becontested at the general peace.     The  Central Powers. In the joint telegram of  the allied  Ministers  at Jassy[No. 1378], they also  said that the Rumanian Government had been asked by the centralPowers to  make a  declaration repudiating any design on Transylvania,  and anotherasking for  the German occupation to be continued.  To justify the latter, the centralPowers had sent  agents to  Russia to stir up trouble ; one  of these,  a former military attache of  the Austrian  legation in Bucharest, had  been provided with  considerablefunds to  corrupt refugees from Transylvania  and obtain from them a declaration  ofloyalty to Austria-Hungary.                                    SERBIA.     The  Proposed  Greater Serbia.- Lord  Acton  reported  on the  2nd  November[No. 2086]  the gist of a conversation  he had had with the new Serbian Minister,M. Jovanovitch.  The latter, he said, had told him that the union of  Croatia, Sloveniaand Montenegro with Serbia,  forming a single kingdom under the present Serbiandynasty, had been quite  decided upon:  All  parties,  the inhabitants of Montenegroincluded,  had  agreed that a federal system would be too cumbrous and would brintr aboutfrjction  between the component  states.   Due  provision&apos; would be  made  for  themaintenance of the King of Montenegro and his family.     The  question  of Gorizia and  Fiume would  probably  cause friction  with Italy,especially in regarrl to Fiume, as  there  Italians were  in  the  majority, the only  citywhere this was the case.  But Italy was well  provided with ports on the Adriatic andthe Serbian Government  did not  see its way to  handing over Fiume ; and if it did the city  would die  of inanition, for  Serbian trade would not  go to a  non-Serbian port,whilst the Italian trade  would naturally flow to other ports.                                  BULGARIA.    Abdication  of  King Boris. Renter&apos;s agent  at Copenhagen  reported  on  the1st November that  according to  information received from Berlin King Boris  hadabdicated and a peasant Government  had been formed at  Tirnova under the leader-hipof  Stambulinsky.  And  on  the  following  day  the  agent  at  Amsterdam  furtherreported  that  the Berlin papers had  published  a telegram received by the BulgarianMinister at  Kieff from Sofia via Constantinople, stating that a Council of Regency had.taken charge of affairs in Bulgaria, and that M. Stambulinsky  had an army of 40,000-men behind him.
ALBANIA.     Meeting of Albanians in Switzerland [E.R. XCII, p.  3]. On the 4th  NovemberMr. Balfc mr telegraphed to Lord Derby, Mr. Barclay, and Sir Rennell Rodd informing them of the resolution passed at the, meeting of Albanians in Switzerland in regard to the liberated districts of Albania.  Mr, Balfour added that he felt that no action  having inview the bringing- of all the liberated  districts  under one  administration  should  betaken at present, if it were of a nature to prejudice the consideration of  the Albanianquestion at the peace congress.                                     TURKEY.     Terms of the Armistice. The following are the terms of the armistice  agreed toby Turkey :                                      *      1.

Wingate  on the -30thOctober [No. 1305] informing him that a report had been received to the effect tnat theShaykh  of the Senussi had been appointed  Vice-Sultan of Tripoli  by the Sultan ofTurkey with a view to his participation in the peace conference, when he would demand the evacuation of the territories occupied  by Italy, on  the  ground  that  fur  years anattempt  had  been made to carry out that  occupation in  defiance of the wishes of theinhabitants,  which was a  position  in antagonism with the principles laid  down byMr.  Wilson.                                   MOROCCO.     Insecurity in the Spanish Zone. The &quot;Times&quot; correspondent at Tangier reported on the 28th  October that  there  was  increasing insecurity  in the  Spanish zone  ofMorocco.   The  Spanish press had  announced  that General Jordana at Tetuan andGeneral  Barrera at Larache had issued orders forbidding any Spaniard, civil or military,to leave  those towns unaccompanied  on account  of the reigning  insecurity.  In  case ofsoldiers being obliged to proceed into the  country they must  travel in detachments, inorder to  defend themselves if attacked.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                                                     !     King  Hussein and the Administration of  Syria.--On the 1st November SirReginald Wingate  reported [No.  1600] that he  had  informed the King of Hsjaz of the contents of Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 12th October [No.  1240,  P.R. XC, p. 4],and  that in reply the  King bad sent  two messages.     The tone of&quot;  the first, in  which  he s;fd that his  views had already been given,showed his dislike of  the present  arrangements very clearly, and in  the second, which seems to have been despatched  twenty-four hours after  the othtr,  he  said that those arrangements were fatal to  his interests.  He had no  wish  to  incur the enmity ofFrance, and he realised  ihe need for avoiding  disagreement between that country andGreat Britain, but at the same time  it was impossible to conceive the idea of a countryentirely under foreign control and cut off from the coast beiii^ prosperous.  For theIslamic world, lie said, it was now a  case for suicide.  Sir Reginald Wingate thought itwould  be ill-advised  to treat  this  as insincere ; the  King  had already referred to achange of government at Mecca in the near future, and he, Sir Reginald,  felt but little doubt as to his intention to abdicate.     He  would remind  the King  that  the  present  arrangements  were  provisional.As to  a declaration,  so far as he  could judge,  none  would appeal either  to king hussein  or to the  great majority of Arabs and Syrians which did not give assurances that (I )  no Arab or Syrian territory would be annexed by France ; (2) the developmentof local self-government and the safeguarding of Arab national aspirations would be theonly objects of any French control;  and  (3) the Arab Government at Damascus would   Ihave the control of a Mediterranean port with free access thereto.     General Allenby, Sir Reginald Wingate  added, had been consulted and concurred in this telegram, to which Mr. Balfour replied on the 4th November [No.  1325] sayingthat the, Anglo-French declaration  appeared to  cover  the  first  and  second  points;the third, however, must stand over  pending the securing of French assent.        xi*
     Representation of  King Hussein  at Conferences.- Mr. Balfour  telegraphed toGeneral Clayton on the 2nd November  [No.  235 J asking him whether he consideredthe present moment suitable  for inviting King Hussein to nominate a representative toact for him at any inter-allied conference regarding the settlement of Asiatic Turkey,and  also  at the  peace conference.  General  Clayton replied on  the  4th November[No. 163] that the giving of such an invitation without delay was considered essentialby the commander-in-chief, and on the  same day Sir  Reginald Wingate  telegraphed[No. 1616] expressing his hope  that the  invitation  would be sent as soon as possible,and added that Emir Feisal would be particularly suitable on account of his personalityand his knowledge of Syria.    Renewal  of Pledge  to  King Hussein.   On the  2nd  November  Mr.  Balfourtelegraphed [No. 13191 to Sir  Ragimdd  Wiugate telling him  that if lie thought  it advisable  he might take  advantage of  the armistice  with Turkey  to repeat ourpledge to  King Hussein that  at the peace  conference we should  maintain his sovereignindependence in Hejaz.YEMEN.     The Imam  and  the Turks. On  the  5th  November  the G.O.C.-in-C,  Aden,telegraphed saving that Said  Pasha had declared that the Imam would not agree to theTurks  evacuating Yemen till they  hid  paid their debts, which  amounted to somehundreds  of thousands of pounds, and that he feared the massacre  of any detachmentswhich should endeavour to reach the coast.     It would appear, the  G.O.C. said,  that the Turks had been financed by the Imam.There  was an  envoy from the latter in  Aden, and he was being sent to his masterwith a letter informing him as to the armistice terms, impressing  on him that he wouldbe expected  to  ^ive every assistance in the immediate evacuation of the Turks, andtelling him that there would be a settlement of financial and territorial questionslater on.     The G.O.C. remarked that the Imam would now look to us for  financial assistance ;it was not, however, easy to see what he would give in return.THE SHAMMAR.     Ibn  Rashid  and   King  Hussein. Sir  Reginald  Wingate  reported  on the4th  November [No.  1613] that Emir  Abdulla  had informed King Hussein that hissovereignty had  been acknowledged by  Ibn Rashid, and that the King had repliedthat Ibn Rashid should send  a deputation of tribal chiefs and so make his submissionpublic.   Emir  Abdulla  having  further  reported  that  Ibn  Rashid had begged for facilities to obtain grain from Mesopotamia, King Hussein was sending, or had  sent,him some 1,200  bags  of  rice, presumably  as  a  pledge of his  willingness to  treatwith him.                                      SYRIA.     Anglo-French Declara.tion.-The following is the text of  the declaration in regardto Syria issued by the British and French Governments :      Le but qifenvisageht la  France et la  Grande-Bretagne en poursuivant en Orient laguerre dechainee par 1&apos;ambition alleman.de, c&apos;est raffranchissement complet et definitifdes  p^uples si longtemps opprimes par les Turcs, et 1&apos;etablissement de gouvernementset d&apos;administrations nationaux puisant leur autorite dans 1&apos;initiative et le fibre choix despopulations indigenes.     Pour dormer suite a ces  intentions, la France et la Grande-Bretagne sont  d&apos;accordpour encourager et aider a 1&apos;etablissement  de  gouvernements et d&apos;administrationsindigenes  en Syrie et  Mesopotamie actuellement  liberees par les Allies et  dans lesterritoires dont  ils poursuivent  la liberation et pour reconnaitte ceux-ci aussit6t  qudlsst-ront effectivement etablis.   Loin de vouloir imposer aux  populations de ces regions,.telles ou telles institutions, elles n&apos;ont d&apos;autre souci que d&apos;assurer par leur appui  et parune assistance efficace  le fonctionnement  normal des gouvernements et administrationsqu&apos;elles se seront librement  donnes, assurer une  justice  impartiale  et egale  pour tous,faciliter le  developpement  economique du  pays en  suscitant  et  en encourageantdes       [898-120]                                                     &apos;   D
initiatives locales, favoriser la diffusion de  &quot;instruction, mettre fin aux divisions troplongtemps exploitees par la politique turque, tel est le role que les deux gouvernementsallies revendiquent dans les territoires liberes.     On the 31st October Mr.  Balfour telegraphed [No. 6526]  to Mr. Barclay  in regardto this declaration saying that the text thereof was being telegraphed to his Frenchcolleague in  Washington.   Mr. Balfour at the same time  informed Mr. Barclay thatthere had been some difficulty with the French Government in regard to  the wording of the clause in the second paragraph  giving  the  areas affected.  Mr. Balfour quotedthe actual words, and instructed Mr. Barclay to make sure that the version telegraphedto the French embassy agreed therewith.  The  text would be communicated to theArabs as soon as Mr. Balfour had/heard that it had been communicated  to the President.It had, he added, been decided that documents bearing on the  Middle East question,including  the agreements  of  1916, 1917,  and 1918,  should also be brought to hisnotice.     Emir  FeisaVs Message to Mr. Balfour [E.B.  XC1T, p. 6].- on the 30th OctoberGeneral  Clavton  telegraphed [No.  1511  a  continuation  of the  message sent toMr.  Balfuur by Emir Feisal, who now added that it was to our victorious army that theArab nation was indebted for all its  success, that army which had taken up arms-to liberate, and protect the rights of, oppressed nations and to save humanity.   He  hopedthat Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram, of which he was proud, might be regarded as  a token thathis race might view the future with  an easy mind, now that Great Britain had freed it from despotism.     Emir  FeisaVs Appeal to British  Honour. General Clayton reported on the 30thOctober [No.  153] that Emir Feisal had strongly protested against the inclusion  of the&quot;cazas&quot; of  Baalbek,  Hasbaya, and   Bashaya  in the French  area.  He had  sent atelegram  to  General  Allenby acknowledging the latter&apos;s message   regarding  suchinclusion and pointing out that already for twenty clays an orderly Arab Governmenthad  been  established  in those districts.   The handing of them over to  France  would greatly increase the doubts of the people, who already, in consequence of the withdrawalof the Arab  Government from  Beirut, were in a  state of great anxiety  in  regard tothe intentions of France.  Should the cession be insisted oh, he should  leavy the country before it  was actually carried out, as otherwise  his position would  be an  impossibleone ; only  under the compulsion of a  superior force could  the  cession be accepted on political grounds.  British  statesmen had  repeatedly declared that the . future  of thecountry must be settled in accordance  with the will of  the people, and this declarationhad been  confirmed at  Jecldah on the occasion of the interview between King Hussein,Sir Mark Sykes, and M. Picot.  Emir Feisal went on to asx General Allenby to appoint a mixed commission with the least possible delay to ascertain the wishes of the people.If  the country wished for French supremacy then it must be ceded to  her: but hewould never  be a part)&apos;&apos; to the handing of it over as  spoils of war.   Were this done the  Arabs would be  disgraced, and not they  only but Great Britain  as well, for whenthey revolted against the Turks Great  Britain  had invited them to rely on her honour.     Emir  Feisal had, General Clayton added,  been satisfied for the moment by General Allenby&apos;s  decision that for the present these districts were to remain under the Arab-governor.     The Druses.-General Clayton reported on the 31st October [No. 155] that sixtyshaykhs of debel Druse had had an interview with Kmir  Feisal, who had  spoken  to them of the  Arab tribes with whom  they had blood feuds,  urging them to settle their differences, to which they had given an evasive answer.      The  Druse shaykhs had  also teen interviewed by a French officer who had come from Jerusalem without  any permission from  the commander-in-chief  and without giving any notice of his  movements.   He had informed the shaykhs that the French would have (?the paramount)  interest,  and invited them to send representa rives to Behut. He  also offered them free  education  for their sous in that town.  The leading Druse shaykh asked the advice of the British liaison officer, who told him that he saw no objecuon to  the shiykhs going to Beirut.   He emphasized the unity of the French and British Governments, but the  shaykh gave  the impression  that he did not want any dealings with the French.      This  shaykh  also  told   the  liaison   officer  that  dissatisfaction with  the Arab administration  was increasing among  the  Druses,  and  that  they had  refused to accept
the governor  appointed  by Emir Feisal.  The liaison officer expressed his regret attheir attitude, and pointed out the importance of all joining in the endeavour to form anational government, and of putting aside differences and private feelings to attain that end.  He urged that  the Druses  should support the Arab Government, and that theymight be sure that their interests would be safeguarded.    lierah and Salt Areas. General  Clayton reported on the 31st October [No. 154]that on  the  28th Gaafar  el Askari  took over the government of the^e areas.  the ceremony was attended by the GOG. and his staff, guar-ds of honour were furnished byAustralians and Indian units, and the Arab flag was run up.    Aleppo. General Clayton reported on the 31st October [No.  155] that the onlynews from Aleppo was that all was quiet.   With the approval of General Allenby, EmirFeisal bad despatched a force of 500 irregular cavalry to Hama en route for Aleppo.  Assoon as possible he, Emir Feisal, would go himself to the latter pLace, there to interviewlocal notables and tribal chiefs.    Christian Refugees. General Clayton telegraphed on the 5th November that relieffunds were urgently required for the Armenians, whose numbers were estimated at about40,000, of whom 25,000 were refugees, and of these 17,000 were almost destitute : largenumbers  of the  Armenians  were employed  in factories  by  the Turks.   ExcluuingMaronites and Orthodox,  for whom no figures were yet available, the number of otherChristians in need was estimated at 9,000.                                  PALESTINE.    Return of Jeioish Refugees. General Clayton reported on the 4th November thatsome  2,500  Jewish  refugees had returned  to  their  homes from northern  palestine in the  ten days  ending  27th October.  Many, too, of the  villagers from the east of jordan had returned  to their homes, as had the refugees from Salt, and the remainder were being sent back as transport became available.    Arab Propaganda. la his telegram of the 4th November General Clayton also reported  that there were indications of Arab propaganda emanating from Damascus, butit was unlikely that the population would be appreciably affected by it.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    Speech made btj  General Marshall at  Baghdad. On the 2nd  November general marshall spoke to the notables and people of Baghdad.   He began by reminding themthat when Sir  Stanley Maude entered that city at the head of his victorious  troops,some eighteen months ago, one of his earliest acts had been to issue a proclamation to its inhabitants, and through them  to the  peoples of Iraq, conveying a message ofreassurance and of hope for the future.  He had told them that  the British had comeas deliverers, not as conquerors, and that under their rule there would be equal justice and opportunity for ad, without interference  with any man&apos;s private affairs or religion :and he had promised to devote  himself to the advancement of their material interestsand to the promotion of their liberty.   That  promise General Maude had not lived to redeem ;  it had fallen to  him to complete what his predecessor had  begun,  and  just ayear after the  death of General Maude he had come to announce the victorious ending of the struggle with the Turks.    After a bitter and prolonged struggle, during the last few months the war hQdundergone a dramatic change.  The Turks had  sued for peace, Bulgaria had tenderedher submission without conditions, the German armies were in full  retreat, and Austriahad surrendered  practically  at discretion.  In the course  of  a few days  the  british armies bad advanced from Nazareth to Damascus, thence to Horns and Hama, and so toAleppo :  whilst on the Tigris the whole Turkish army had  been destroyed or captured,and the British were the controllers of the destinies of  Mosul.    The end  of the war  then bad come, so far  as that  theatre  of operations  was concerned, and they could  now show that promises which had been made and repeatedwould be redeemed at the first opportunity.  As an earnest of  their good intentions, heannounced that there would be complete freedom of trade  and relaxation of blockaderestrictions in  the occupied territories, and  therewith a like  relaxation-of restriction oupers mal  movements; that a distribution of food and clothing  would be  ma(le to the poor of Baghdad and other  towns  ; that all permanent employees of the civil administra-
tion taken from the local population, not  actually serving as soldiers, would be granted a month&apos;s pay by way  of bonus; that selected  prisoners  would be  released from thecivil gaols;  that  prisoners of war, not of Turkish nationality, then  in ^India would beallowed to return home; that the routes to the holy places would be thrown opem fororganised pilgrimages, and the  conveyance of bodies  to Kerbela and Najaf for burialpermitted under suitable conditions.     In conclusion, General Marshall asked  those present to believe  that the, vexations -]%caused by the presence  of an army in their midst were due to military necessityplmd -0promised in the name of His Majesty the King that any cause of complaint should beremoved with all possible speed.   He then asked them to join with him in saluting theBritish flag  and to give three cheers for King George.     The speech was theu enthusiastically received.                                     PERSIA.     Armenian Refugees.  Renter reports that a telegram from Enzeli, dated the 2ndOctober, states that 7,000 Armenian refugees from Baku are at  Resht or  Enzeli, and12,000  at Petrovsk.  Tney have been kindly received  by the population and theauthordies,  and measures are being taken for the amelioration of their distress.   Themortality amongst the  orphaned children is terrible.  The British  command is reor-ganising the medical and sanitary arrangements.  In  spite of  illness and distress theallied successes arouse general enthusiasm.o
