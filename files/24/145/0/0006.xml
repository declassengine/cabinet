APPRECIATION OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No. LXVI.                                     RUSSIA     THE article in the  &quot; Pravda&quot;  summarised by  Mr. Lockhart should  be read.   It gives iome  insight into  the working of  the  Bolshevik mind.   The  &quot;Pravda&quot; is  the Government organ, it admits that the German embassy  arrived in Moscow, although the  German army is  still  engaged in conquering  Russia, but it considers  that  the establish nent of a revolutionary embassy  in Berlin is an adequate compensation.                                    CAUCASUS.  &quot;  The Georgiaus and Armenians seem at last to be working in concert; the Georgians will  perhaps have t * pay dearly for their delay in co-operating with the Armenians.                                     POLAND.     The allege 1 treaty stated to have been signed between the Russians and Germans in regard to Poland  should be  read; it  is, perhaps, the most singular agreement  yetseen.  It may be a part of a revolutionary scheme to so  fill Germany with revolutionaryelements as to make the German Govern nent&apos;s task  impossible after the war.                                    BULGARIA.     The Turco-Bulgarian frictioti continues to  develop.   It must be remembered thatthe information comes from a Turkish source.   The Turkish plan is to prevent Bulgariaever  breaking away from  Germany, to make a false peace with us, and then re-establishherself with  German help after tlie war. The fact that the Turks considered reinforcingtheir Chatalja positions shows that inlirecfcly Bulgaria is assisting us in Palestine and mesopotamia even now.                                    TURKEY.    The Turkish information is probably sham  peace propaganda.   The basis is always the same a potential re-estiblish neat of Turkish  power where it has been lost, viz.,Pdestme, Mesopotamia, and Hejaz, and a  free  hand  to  destroy the  Christians of theCaucasus.

In a telegram  [No.  115]  sent  on the 22nd April, Mr. Lockhartsaid that, besides the Bolsheviks, there were, roughly, four political  groups in Russia :(1) That led by Savgratkow, which included the chief pro-war Socialists, really working for a  military  dictatorship whilst professedly  advocating  a  constituent  assembly.(2) The Mensheviks, who advocated a united socialist front and were pledged to destroy the  Brest peace.   (b)  The supporters of  the old monarchy striving  for  a  counter-revolution with German help ;  there  was no  doubt that  the Germans  were  working-most energetically in connection with this group.     The Moscoio Soviet. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 20th  April  [No.  112] that,according to the  official press, the latest figures for the  recent elections  to the MoscowSoviet were:  Bolsheviks and sympathisers 396, Mensheviks and  sympathisers 67, LeftSocial   Revolutionaries  43,  Centre  Social  Revolutionaries  17,  Right  Social Revolu-tionaries 4, Anarchists  5, and non-party 52.     The  &quot; Pravda&quot; on the German  Ambassador. On the  24th April Mr. Lockharttelegraphed  [No.  125] the following literal summary  of  a  leading  article  in the&quot; Pravda,&quot;  the  official Bolshevik organ, on Count Mirbach&apos;s arrival:  The Embassyof the German Government has arrived at Moscow.   It has been pleased to  come tothe  capital  of  Soviet Russia  on the strength  of diplomatic exterritoriality; at thesame time that the German generals, who receive their  orders from  the same staff ofGerman imperialists from  which Mirbach  springs, are entering  Russian towns behindsmoking guns in  the name of a complete right to everything that they can snatch fromthe Soviet Republic.   The German Ambassador arrived  in the revolutionary  capital not as the  representative of  a friendly  nation but as a plenipotentiary uf the  militarygang who, with boundless insolence, are killing, violating, and robbing everywhere they
 can penetrate with their bloody imperialistic  bayonet.   The Ambassador  of  victorious imperialism arrives in the capital of the militarily weakest Socialistic country, and he would be a  fool who took the [?] switch for the olive branch  of peace.  The repre- sentatives of German imperialism have arrived  in  Moscow, but they have been forced to allow  in  Berlin the Bed  Embassy of the Russian revolutionary  Republic.   Even   :o.ur comrades  arrive  in  Berlin as  representatives of  a  defeated  country, in a military sense, they are nevertheless  representatives of a country morally victorious. Not one German workman will meet the Ambassador  of  Socialistic Russia with such hate as that with which to-day in Moscow the Russian proletariat meets the represen- tative of German capital. CAUCASUS.     The &quot; Federal Republic of Trans-Caucasus.&quot; Sir  C.  Marling telegraphed on  the 25th April [No. 355] that it  had  been reported from  Tiflis that a federal republic of Trans-Caucasus had been proclaimed by the Caucasus Government.  On the 23rd April that Government telegraphed to the commander-in-chief of  the Turkish forces informing him that it had ordered the cessation of hostilities, and expressing the hope that he would do the same.  At the time  of telegraphing, however, the Turks had not agreed to this.     Telegraphing again  on  the 27th April  [No. 360], he said  that a new Ministry, consisting of Armenian Georgians, under Tchenkelis,  had been formed at Tiflis ;  the Tartars had refused  to take any place in it.   The provinces of Batoum and Karguzar would be given  up.     On the  29th April he transmitted [No. 365] a telegram, dated the 28th April, from the consul at Tabriz,  who had been informed  by the Prussian consul-general that more encouraging  news had been  received from Tiflis.   It was expected that in a few days&apos; time  the Tiflis-Julfa  railway would be working ;  the Government had decided that hostilities  should  be  continued ;  and capital  punishment  had been authorised  in  the Georgian army. SIBERIA.     M. Semenoff. Sir J. Jordan telegraphed from  Pekin on the  27th April [No. 375] that it was evident, from information he had  received, that,  with  the object of causing a rising  in  the event of his advancing on  Chita, M. Semenoff  was  carrying on a considerable  propaganda among  the  Transbaikal  Cossacks;  to  whom,  too,  he was distributing  arms.  Sir J.&apos; JordaiTs  informant was a Russian officer who had  gone to Pekin from M. SemenolPs staff.                                     POLAND.     Treaty between Russia and Germany. Mr. Woodhouse telegraphing from Petrograd on the 22nd  April [No. 136], said that Germany and. Russia had signed a special  treaty at Brest in regard to  Poland, a treaty, however, which would be considered by Russia as non-existent should Germany change her Polish policy.  Mr. Woodhouse had  learnt this on good  authority. The main points of the treaty were : (1) All political parties in Poland were  to be absolutely controlled by Germany, who, however, would not interfere with Russia&apos;s socialistic propaganda ;  (2) all  existing  Polish military units in Russia would be disarmed, and the formation of new ones prevented ; (3) Russia would not object to the annexation by  Germany of the Dombrova  coal district if the latter Power considered the doing so a necessity ; (4)  Rnssia would support the view that the Polish question was German, and not international, at the peace conference.    Mr. Wooclhouse&apos;s informant said that well-informed Poles thought the rising of the whole  nation against the Germans  a possibility, so strong in the occupied territories was the anti-German feeling.                                     SERBIA.    Parliamentary Crisis. Sir C. cles Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the 28th April [No. 53] that on the  27th  the Government  had been left  without a quorum in the Skuptchina, as the united opposition had refused to vote the budget and had left in a body :  a fresh parliamentary crisis  had consequently  arisen.                                  BULGARIA.    Bulgarian Pretensions. Sir H. Ptumbold telegraphed, on the 25th April [No. 632Jthat he had been informed by  the military attached department that it had received the
II  following information from a reliable person in close touch with the Turkish Legation inU  Berne : -       Next to the offensive on the western front, the question most on the minds of thefl  Central Powers was that of the relations between Bulgaria and Turkey.   These turned?!  on Bulgaria&apos;s  claim  to the Dobrudja on the one  hand, and  to the Gumuldjina districtII  on the other.       The  Dobrudja  was  conquered by  the joint efforts  of Germany,  Turkey, andIf  Bulgaria, and  both  Germany and Turkey were willing  that Bulgaria  should  retain it.jl  Bulgaria was not satisfied with this, but  also claimed  the Gumuldjina district, insistingI  especially that the Adrianople-Dedeagatch Railway was essential to her commerce. Shell  refused to regard herself indebted to  Germany for assistance in the  conquest of theI  Dobrudja.  She said that Germany only helped her, to divert pressure from her AustrianI  ally, whose position  at the time was so critical as to be a menace to Germany herself.;1      Accordingly Bulgaria would not enter into negotiations  except on the unrler-fj  standing that she had both the  Dobrudja and  Gumuldjina.   The Turkish Government;j  had reason to  believe that Austria, who appeared to be a disinterested spectator, wasI  really  abetting Bulgaria&apos;s pretensions.       For some  months past Bulgaria had been  asking Germany for  troops  to help inI  an offensive on the Macedonian front.   Germany did not like to refuse.   Neither didI  she like to assent, because such  an offensive was sure  to  lead to complications, theI  interests of Bulgaria and Austria being opposed in this region.       About a  fortnight ago Talaat  spoke  out  very  strongly  at  a meeting of the   Committee of Union and Progress about  Bulgarian pretensions.  Some of these present   went  so far as  to  rjropose  that the first army corps at  Constantinople should  be   reinforced and sent to the Chataldja-Adrianople railway.  Talaat, however, thought thatI  this was unnecessary, in view of the assurances given  by Germany.                                      TURKEY.       Turkey and the War.  Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed [No. 622] on the 24th  April   the following  report of a conversation between the well-known Albanian, Dr. Adamidi,   and the  Turkish Senator Boustani, which had  been  communicated  by the military   attaches department.       Boustani  told Adamidi that a strong movement  in  favour of peace was beginning   among the Young Turks.   Ever  since  the Russian collapse had removed the hereditary -  bugbear,  they  had  been  turning their  eyes   eastwards, and dreaming  of  Pan-   Turanianism.       They  could  not, however, expand peacefully in the East while  the British were   hammering them on both flanks.   They were greatly  impressed by the arrival of the   British at Aana  and  the  cutting  of  the Hejaz  railway.   They  were also  very   despondent about  Baghdad.   They  feared  the   occupation and fortification of the   Hamma  Mountains  by the British.  These  once seized, it would take half a million   Turco-Germans to drive them out.       Promises  of  German help were  not  encouraging.  Also  Turkish officers were   getting more and more discontented with the Germans.   Moustapha Pasha Kemal, who   was considered one of their best  officers,  had already resigned the command at Aleppo   owing to differences with Falkenhajm.       The Turks were beginning to feel  that they had  nothing to gain by continuing the   war.   If the German offensive  in the  West failed, the  Turks were  undoubtedly most;   and if it succeeded they would not be much better off.       Talaat, now that the Russian danger was over, thought of nothing but the making   of peace : he had sanctioned an inter-parliamentary conference on behalf of peace,  which   Boustani was anxious should be held  in  Switzerland.  Germany had  been approached   on the matter, but had not yet replied.       Boustani had told  Talaat  plainly that  Mesopotamia,  Syria, and Arab  Palestine   were for ever lost to Turkey.   The Turks,  however,  still had some hope  of  Palestine   and Mecca..       In this they were encouraged by the ex-Khedive :  he devoted all his energies to.   this, and was always trying to get Arab  and Persian chiefs to come to Constantinople.                                    ABYSSINIA.       Expulsion of Germans [E.R. LIX, p. 3, and LXIV, p. 3). Mr. Thesiger telegraphed   [No. 39] from Adds Ababa on the 24th April that it  seemed futile to attempt further         [898-93]                       *                                 B 2
negotiations, as he had been given to understand by Has Taffari that if this were doneall hope of a successful issue would depend on the Powers taking  into consideration  his original demand for rifles and cartridges.                                   PALESTINE.     Attitude of the native.es. On the 27th April General Clayton telegraphed that, inspite of enemy  sympathisers  being  encouraged  by the  German  offensive on  thewestern front, the attitude of the natives  continued, on the whole, to  be satisfactory.The increase in Arab activity on the east of Jordan had had  a good  effect  on othertribes in that locality.  On  the 23rd April delegates from an influential tribe had cometo notify a considerable tribal concentration and to ask for instructions  with a view to close co-operation with our forces; this was the first occasion on which actual touch hadbeen obtained with Arab forces,  and, having regard to the importance  of the tribe, itshould have a  good  effect on all Arab tribesmen east  of the Jordan  and up to theHauran.     Germans and Austrians. On the 23rd April Mr. Balfour  telegraphed [No. 79j toGeneral Clayton asking what steps  had  been taken  to remove  German  and Austrianinfluence from institutions and schools.  In reply, General Clayton said  that action was proceeding on the lines of his telegram of the 9th April.   [E. Li. LXIII,  p. 5.]                                    ARABIA.     Political  future  of  Arabia.- Gn  the 23rd March a meeting was held at  theResidency in Cairo for the consideration and discussion of the political future of Arabia.There were present Sir Reginald Wingate, G.C.B., High  Commissioner ;  Sir Percy Cox,G.C.I.E. ; Brigadier-General Clayton, C.B.;  Colonel  Wilson,  C.M.G. ;  Lieut.-ColonelSymes,  C.M.G.; Lieut.-Colonel Jacob, C.S.I. ; Commander Hogarth, R.N.V.R., C.M.G.;and  Major Cornwallis, D.S.O.     Sir Percy Cox opened the discussion with some remarks on the attitude  of  ibn saud, who, he said, was evidently exceedingly jealous and suspicious of King Hussein.He was convinced that Ibn  Saud would never acknowledge the  King  as his temporaloverlord, though,  as  now,  he would always pay  him  the  great respect due to  his \religious position; and it was,  he said, inconceivable to him that Ibn Saud shoulddeliberately attack King Hussein during the war, though he was taking every precautionto consolidate his position in his own country.     Should he be in a position to take  Bail during the war, which seemed unlikely,Sir P. Cox thought  that we should put no obstacle in his  way;  though, as regardsafter-war conditions, it would seem that the continued independent rule of Ibn Rashidthere would better preserve  the  balance of power in Arabia.   Though  in the  abstractIbn Sau d doubtless aspired to regain Hail for his family, Sir P. Cox  did not think himreally keen on capturing it just now.  Colonel Wilson remarked that, when Hejaz was clear of Turks, Sherif Abdulla would probably  send a force against Hail, and  asked what effect this would have  on Ibn  Saud.   Sir P. Cox replied  that such a move would no doubt be strongly  resented by him.     It was agreed that there seemed but little likelihood of the  Imam, Idrisi, and  ibn saud accepting King  Hussein as their temporal  overlord. &apos;The King&apos;s  future positiondepended, to a considerable  extent, on the  measure  of success gained by the Arabs inthe North ;  but it was pointed out that the inhabitants of Syria and Mesopotamia were at one in their determination to  allow no direct interference in their  affairs on the partof the King.   Sir Percy  Cox discounted the possibility of King Hussein ever being in aposition to crush Ibn  Saud, and thought  that  the  Ateiba would always  be a  bufferbetween them.     As to the Caliphate, Sir P.  Cox considered that if the Turks were  eliminated fromthe  Arab countries,  King Hussein&apos;s  assumption thereof would be accepted without opposition by the. Moslems  in Mesojjotamia and by Ibn Saud ; but Sir  R. Wingatethought that such a step would be received coldly in Egypt, where there was  but littlesympathy with the Sherifian movement.     Sir  P.  Cox  said that  in  view of   our  Baghdad proclamation  the  people  ofMesopotamia  doubtless  expected  some form  of  Arab administration,  but it was essential that there should  be a complete British financial and administrative control,free  from  the slightest  Turkish  taint.   Apparently, they  did  not  contemplate
any  Arab individual  as ruler.  It was essential that there should not be the  leastparticipation or interference on the part of Turkey in the control or administration ofthe country.   On the other hand, if it were necessary to retain a nominal recognitionof Turkish suzerainty, which might be acknowledged by a quit rent, he did not considerthat the solution would  be difficult; but in that event it  would be necessary, beforeannouncing it, to give the leaders of the Irak communities a lull explanation as to  what it would involve.HEJAZ.     Mission to the Caucasus  and  Turkestan  [E.R.  LXIII, p.  3].   Sir R.  Wingatetelegraphed  [No. 737] on the 23rd  April that the delegation was  expected  to reachEgypt about the 1st May.  King Hussein had determined not to send Suliman Azhar,but the latters brother,  Ahmed Azhar, who would be  accompanied by  Ibrahim Azharand Mahomet Said Pasha.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     Nejef. The political officer  at Baghdad telegraphed on the 25th April that Nejefwas then quiet ; Kadhim  Subbi  and three  other ringleaders  had been  captured ; andfurther measures were being taken to ensure the arrests of the other ringleaders and ofmurderers still in the town.  The blockade was being closely maintained.  Some 3,000pilgrims and travellers had been  evacuated.                                    PERSIA.     The Cabinet [E.R. LXIV,  p.  5].-Sir  0. Marling  telegraphed on  the 23rd April[No. 343]  that the Shah was being urged on all sides to dismiss the Cabinet, but was tootimid to 0/0 so ; he had expressed his willingness to Sir C. Marling, but had added thathe must wait for a reasonable pretext after having so insistently pressed Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek to  retain office.     Arrangement  with  the Bakhtiari Khans [E.R.  LXIII, p.  4], Sir C.  Marlingtelegraphed  on the 22nd April [No. 335] that the vice-consul at Ahwaz, who  had beenin close touch with Mr. Young, had reported having reached an arrangement with theIlkhani  and  Ilbegi :  they would undertake the Kuhgelus  expedition, and till theoperation  vyas completed Mujahid  and Shahab  would be left in  the north.   Providedthat he remained  Ilkbani and  conformed  absolutely  to  our wishes,  Zafar  was toreceive a monthly subsidy of 1,500 tomans  to  the end of the war;  and. a lump sum of6,000 tomans was to be paid to him and the Ilbegi jointly in. the autumn.   They alsowanted  a loan of  10,000  tomans, repayable by instalments for  the  expenses of the expedition :  as this was urgent,  Sir C. Marling had authorised payment.  The Ilkhaniand Ilbegi had undertaken in writing to  expel  hostile agents and  to check enemy(? intrigues).     Turkey, Germany, and Persia.  Sir u. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the25th April [No. 632] that the  military attached department  had  been informed,  by  aperson in close touch with the  Turkish legation in that place,  of  the presence inBerlin of Mohammed Mirza  Ali  Khan,  Nasir-ul-Islam, and  Said Mohammed  RizaMossawat, which,  having  regard  to  the attempts  of Turkey and  Germany to bringPersia into the war was, he thought, significant.     Two clays earlier Sir H. Rumbold had  telegraphed  [No.  612] that information hadbeen received  that more  Turks had  left  Constantinople for Persia for propaganda purposes,  all of whom  had  been  made members of the Committee  of Union  and progress.     The Jangalis. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on  the 23rd  April  [No.  344] thatArdabil had been &quot;retaken and the Jangali movement was apparently on  the wane.     The Jehus [E.R.  LXIV, p. 5].-Mr. Balfour&apos; telegraphed to Sir C. Marling on the25th April [No. 219] that the Hamaclan Board  would by arrangement pay the troopsin the Urumiah region : the Jelus would, as before, be paid  at  the rate  of 20  roubles amonth for men in the rear and 35 for those  in the front line.  They should be able toarrange an escort for their pay.  As to the suggested escape of the Russian officersafter receiving their pay, this  might be guarded against by issuing the pay  in  smallsums pending the arrival of British officers.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.    Political Parties [see p. 1], Mr. Wardrop telegraphed on the 24th April [No.  229]that the power of the  Bolsheviks was steadily on the increase, whilst all other parties.:were  completely  disorganised.  The Bolsheviks held the whole  of  Southern Russia,except the territory which the Germans occupied.   They were not making any effectivestand  against the  advance of the latter;  but  they easily suppressed the rising  atNovocherkask on the 14th April, and were taking severely repressive measures againstthe Cossacks.                                    SERBIA.    Parliamentary Crisis  [see p.  2]. -Sir C. des Graz telegraphed on the  30th April[No. 56] that the Prime  Minister had  refused to accept the conditions on which theOpposition had declared its readiness to join in a coalition Government.                                  PALESTINE.    Armenian Refugees. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to General Clayton on the 1st May[No. 88] asking whether arrangements could be made for the systematic rescue  of thelarge number of Armenian refugees, whose  presence in Palestine had been reported  tothe Armenian Refugees Fund.o
