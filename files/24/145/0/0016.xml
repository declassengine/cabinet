3QRET.64LPPRECIAXION  OF THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT, No.  LXXVI.                                    Russia.  Though it is impossible to see for the present how matters will end in Russia, it isirth noting that certain things are assuming a more definite shape. Firstly, the actualiance  between the  Bolshevik  leaders and  the Germans is  now practically open andashamed.  The pretence that the Bolsheviks are not the Allies of the German Imperialvernment is hardly maintained  even as a form.  Secondly,  the  Socialists of the leftd certain of their anti-Bolshevik allies  have now adopted the old policy of Terrorism.ie assassination of Baron Mirbach may  be the first of a series of similar acts, which ofarse will provoke reprisals.  Hitherto the bloodshed which has taken place in Russiaice the Revolution  has been the result  of the action  of mobs or gangs  of ruffiansipired  by^fKS^passion.   We now  enter  the phase wherein judicial murders  andsassinations resulting from deliberate conspiracies are the order of the day.  The Don Cossacks&apos; declaration should be noted.  The remainder of this report contains little or nothing of  importance.  The paucitynews  is attributable to telegraphic interruption.                                                                         M. S.  July 11, 1918.I 898-103

On the 23rd June Mr.  Lockhart telegraphed [No. 302 receivedthe 5th July] that a counter-revolution seemed imminent.     Vice-Consul Guiltiname  who  left Moscow on  the 1st July  reported  that theGermans were  then masters  of the  situation and the  Bolsheviks  appeared to be fairly confident in regard to their position ;  the latter  had arrested and shot a numberof persons suspected of conspiracjr.   Feeling was running high  against the British andMr.  Wardrop felt  that any. day he might  lie  obliged  to leave.   This was telegraphedfrom Archangel on  the 6th July [No. 12] by  Mr. Lindley who  added  that Mr. Leech,who had reached Archangel on the  previous day from Petrograd, had  informed him  ofthe definite and successful adoption of methods of terrorism.     On the 7th July the  secretary  of the  General Post Office  informed the ForeignOffice. that radio  news had been  received that  Count  Mirbach  had been &quot;put  to death &quot; and that all Moscow had been taken  by the counter-revolutionaries.     On the same  clay Mr.  Lindley  telegraphed from  Vologda  information of the proclamation of martial law in that place.     Assassination  of Count Mirbach. On the  6th July M. Lenin sent,the followingwireless message to M.  Ioffe in Berlin :  To-day at 2 o clock two. unknown  men, withfalse documents from the extraordinary commission, appeared at the German Embassyand  threw a   bomb  into   the  apartment   of  Count  Mirbach,  who was  killed.Representatives  of the  Russian Government immediately paid a visit to the GermanEmbass)1- and expressed its indignation.  The  Government is taking all necessary stepsto discover the murderers and to hand them  over to  an extraordinary  revolutionarytribunal.     Black Sea Fleet. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed  on the 23rd June [No. 302, received5th July] that in  consequence of the Germans  having  threatened  to continue their advance if the Black Sea fleet were not handed-over, the Bolsheviks had sent a wireless message to Novorossick ordering its return to Sevastopol.  But at the same time  secretinstructions for its  destruction were sent, and in consequence all the dreadnoughts, but one, and most of the destroyers were destroyed.  Owing however to some unexplainedconfusion  one   dreadnought and  two or  three  destroyers  apparently returned  toSevastopol.

     Trade Unions and Political Strikes. The following wireless message was sent onthe 3rd July to M. Ioife in Berlin by the Bolshevik Government :  -  ----------     The united conference of the committees from factories and works and of represen-tatives of trade unions was devoted to the discussion of the question of political strikes,in view of the fact that a political strike of railway men was expected.   After discussion the following resolution was passed :      The latest  decree  of the  Council  of the People&apos;s Commissioners  transfers to theauthority of the Soviet Republic all the large works and enterprises of an industrialcharacter, together with  all the  productive forces of the country.  In the future the organised working classes and trade unions  will have as their task to organise, underthe  leadership of the councils, new bodies for the administration of these industries and means of production.  When  the working men are disciplined and these  enterprisesare  directed under the leadership of working men&apos;s administrations, they will increasethe  productive forces of the  country  and by the common  effort will  put an end to internal  disorganisation.   In  these  conditions every  cessation of work is an  act  oftreachery to the cause  of the  revolution  and the proletariat and will be  helping the capitalists  to re-establish their  power by famine.   The time has arrived when theworking classes must expect that every  workman will place first of all the interests ofthe Avorking classes as a whole  and not the interests of his particular group.THE DON COSSACKS.     Declaration  of  Independence. On  the 20th  June  Mr.  Wardrop  telegraphed[No. 454] saying that on the  11th  the  Spanish  vice-consul at Kieff (who was tem-temporarily charged with the protection of British interests in Ukraina) had  transmitted adeclaration  (received for transmission  from the Don Ambassador  in  Kieff) .datedNovocherkask the 4th June, new style, and  signed  by Major-General  Peter Krasnov,Ataman  of  the Don,  and  Major-General  Bogaevski, President of  the  Council  ofGovernment,  which,  after  briefly  narrating the past history of the  Don Cossacks&apos;territory,  announced  General  Krasnov&apos;s  election  on the   17th May as  Atamanwith full  powers,  pending the meeting of the Grand Assembly (Krug),  and statingthat :      1. Until the reunion of Russia  the  Don constituted  an independent  democratic            republic headed by General Krasnov.     2. The Don terrritory  continued to  form part  of the South-Eastern Federation,            and bound itself to support the interests of the federated states and their            lawful governments.     3. (? Regarding) the establishment of (?  the exact) boundaries and commercial and            other relations between  the  Don  and Ukraina negotiations  were  proceed-            ing, and  MM.  Cheryachukin and  Svechin had  been sent  as  envoys (to            Kieff).     4. The  Don  army was riot at war with  any Power ; but, while maintaining            neutrality, it  carried on  the  struggle with the  brigand bands of  the  Red            Guards sent to the Don  territory by the Soviet.     5. Henceforth the Don army desired to live at peace with all peoples.     6. The Don asked  all states to recognise  its rights pending the formation, in some            form&apos; or other, of a United Russia, and  to  send to Novocherkask Plenipotentiaire-            tentiary representatives or delegates.     7. In return the  Don  army  would  send its envoys  to such states  to  establish            friendly relations.     The copy  of this declaration was sent for the use of the  British Ambassador, witha request from the Ataman that it should be made known to all British citizens.SIBERIA.     New Government. Sir J. Jordan telegraphed from Pekin on the 4th  July  [No. 568]that the seat of the new  Government was for the time at Novonicolaievsk on  the riverOb, and its area of  influence from  Penza in European Russia to Nijniudinsk, slightlyto the west of Irkutsk;  that is it is coterminous  with the country controlled by the czechs upon whose support its existence depends.   This new Government is entirelydistinct from the generally  discredited &quot; Government of autonomous Siberia &quot; which bidfor allied help  some months ago.
     Counter-Revolutionary Movement. On the 8th  July Sir C. Greene  transmitted[No. 721] a message from the military attache at Tokio, who said that the Grand DukeMichael had placed himself at the head of a counter-revolutionary movement at Omsk.     Prisoners  of War. Sir  J. Jordan telegraphed on  the  4th Jury [No. 557] thatMr. Porter, who had been in Siberia, had reported, on his return,  that it was estimatedthat there were a quarter of a million prisoners of war who  were under  no  effective control and circulated freely in the towns.  Some  15,000-20,000, chiefly Magyars, had joined the Bolshevik Red Guards, and formed the mainstay of the Bolshevik supremacyin Siberia.     German Intrigues. In the same report Mr. Porter said that  he had been informed as to secret negotiations for the leasing of the Trans-Siberian railway up to Irkutsk  tothe Germans, to  give them economic control over Western Siberia.   At Omsk he had found that German agents  were buying up stocks of cotton, wool,  &amp;c.                                    TURKEY.     Ideas of the Turkish Extremists. In a telegram dated the 3rd July [No. 1077]Sir H.. Rumbold said that the military attached department had  received the followingaccount of a conversation with Nedjmeddine Mullah, ex-shaykh-ul-Islam, who  had justarrived from Constantinople and Berlin.   This conversation was of interest, as showingthe extremist point of view in Turkey.     The meeting of the Prime  Ministers of Germany&apos;s allies had been postponed to adistant  date, as a  definite  agreement must first be reached between  Germany and austria on the one hand and between Turkey and Bulgaria on the  other, as the ottoman government  had determined not to abandon its claims and Bulgaria insisted on com-pensation in the shape of the cession of Salonica.     The  Black Sea question would certainly  be settled to the advantage of Turkey as germany and  Austria were well  disposed.  The Black  Sea must  be under Turkishmilitary  rule and a Turkish navy must be kept therein, Turkey  being  the only power which now held more than half the littoral.     The  question of the Caucasus  affected  Turkish national life,  and the  ottoman government insisted on a common frontier with Turkestan and  direct communication between  Batoum  and Persia.  Germany&apos;s desire  to control  some of the  small states which had sprung from the Russian revolution was no reason for the sacrifice of Turkishinterests.     Germany  was greatly indebted to  Turkey for  having sent  military forces  to  theGalician front, and for having largely  contributed to the  Russian  collapse by  thesuccessful defence of the  straits.    The agreements concluded between Germany and turkey at the  beginning of the war were subject  to revision, and the Russian collapsehad created a new situation.     Turkey  /was the only member of the  quadruple  alliance which  had part of its territory in enemy occupation.  The absence of a Russian front  would enable turkey to send armies to liberate Mesopotamia  and  Palestine with the  promised  help  of her allies.     The  ex-shayk-ul-Islam  then  proceeded to express the  extravagant view  thatBritish  should be compelled to evacuate Egypt, Italy,  Tripoli, France, Algeria, andMorocco.   There was certainly a clause affecting  the  Egyptian question in. the agree-ments between Turkey and Germany.     Turning to the situation on the western  front, Nedjmeddine  expressed the opinionthat the  western Powers would never be able  to beat the Germans, as they  were  not sufficiently strong to hold out till the arrival of the Americans.   The  latter would beof no use in the field for another four years,  though  the continuance of the war wassolely due to their intervention.   Germany would probably succeed in recruiting armiesfrom Ukraina, and the day would come  when she  would obtain military assistancefrom Russia.     Turkish economic life was expanding to  such an extent  that in  a few years  thefinancial situation would be brilliant.  The salvation of Turkey was due to  the Russiancollapse, which had removed the menace of peace which  was  threatening Turkey.   Atthe present moment the Government and the C. U. P. were in entire agreement as tocourse to be followed, and the military question w,is the only one on which any differenceexisted with Germany.   Whenever differences  arose they  were submitted to arbitration by the C. U. P.,  which now contains a committee formed for the purpose.
                                    PERSIA.    Abadeh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  7th  July [No. 612]  that for&apos;&apos; the-purpose of enabling a force to be despatched for  the relief of Abadeh, reinforcementswere being sent to Ispahan by the Russian officer in command of the Cossack division.    Attempted Demovstration against the Government. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed onthe 7th July [No. 610] that, having become possessed of fairly accurate  information ofwhat was afloat, the Government had been able&apos;to check an attempt made to  close thebazaars on the night of the 4th July, use having  been made  of the Cossack division.Sir C. Marling thought that, if the officer in command had refused to act as requested by the Shah, he would have been compelled to resign by his Russian subordinates whowere strongly  anti-British.  The Cabinet  had  certainly  gained  in prestige by  the incident.    State of  Siege in Teheran. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 9th July [No. 614]that Sirdar Mohtasham  had control of - Teheran, the Cabinet having invested  him withabsolute executive powers, after having declared a state of siege.   It appeared that theBakhtiari intended  to  keep  the present Cabinet  in power, as Samsan-es-Sultaneh had called for 300 Bakhtiari sowars, 100 from Sultanabad and the rest from Ispahan.     jo
