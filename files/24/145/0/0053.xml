Churches and  Synagogues. On the  18th March  Sir Charles  Eliot transmitted[No. 287] a telegram which had been sent to him on  the previous  clay by  the  british consul at Ekaterinburg.  \ In this the consul reported that he had been informed by the siberian general staff that it  had  learnt  that, though  the  churches of the Orthodoxhad been closed in those parts of Russia which were  under control of the  Bolsheviks,all the Jewish synagogues were still open ; and, further, that it was proposed  by theBolsheviks that Saturday should be  substituted for Sunday  as the day of rest.  Theinformants of  the  general staff  were  Russian prisoners   who  had  returned  fromGermany.     Bolshevik Massacres. On the 18th March Sir Charles Eliot transmitted [No. 286] atelegram from the British consul at Ekaterinburg reporting that he had been informed by the general staff  of  the  Siberian army  that   massacres still accompanied  theevacuation of towns by the Bolsheviks.  Since the 12th March when ,the Siberianarmy occupied Osa, a register had been compiled of some 2,000 civilians who had beenmurdered before the Bolsheviks  evacuated the town.THE CAUCASUS.     General  Conditions. On the  14th March Mr. Stevens reported  [No. 10]  fromBatum  that  the condition of  the country  was serious,  trade  and industry beingpractically at a standstill.     The workmen at Baku (where affairs are  in a very unsettled  state) accussed theBritish  representative of having intervened in internal affairs, and, after a conference,sent him a letter threatening a general  strike.  But it seemed likely that an amicable settlement of outstanding differences would  follow  an interview  between  a  labourdeputation and the commanding officer, which had lasted for two hours and a half.     In  Georgia there had been a comparatively tranquil week.   The  present SocialDemocratic cabinet was likely to remain unchanged, as the elections had produced  apreponderating majority of Social Democrats in the national assembly.     There were labour troubles  at Batum  and Poti, the workmen demanding an enormous increase on the already high  rate of daily  wage.  Some  20  miles from theformer place a brigand band  held up  a1 train and  robbed the passengers  of 800,000roubles  ; whilst a few miles north of it pirates robbed a  ship and its passengers of over1,000,000.                                 &apos;SIBERIA.     Conditions in Western Siberia. Sir Charles Eliot reported  on the 18th March[No. 284] that, apart from Orenburg, the news from Western Siberia was, on the whole,good.   Even  before the recent military  successes it had been, reported, that more generalconfidence was being felt in Admiral Kolchak&apos;s government.TURKESTAN.   &apos;  Reported  Nationalization   of  English   Undertakings. On   the  24th  MarchMr.  Lindley  reported  [No. 175] that it  had been announced in the &quot;Izvestia&quot; of the21st  February  that  all English  owned  undertakings   in  Turkestan   had  beennationalized.                                                                    ,                                    POLAND.     The Polish Legionaries  in  Lithuania and the Bolsheviks. On the 21st March sir horace Rumbold reported [No. 486J that the  Lithuanian  press  bureau at Berne had issued a communique, dated from Kaunas on the 19th March, to the following effect: The Polish legionaries in Lithuania have  formed a  Bolshevist division on conditionsarranged  between  themselves and  the Bolshevist commissioner  Kapsukas with  the
object of opposing all military action except that of the array of M. Pilsudski.  Fugitivesfrom M. Pilsudski&apos;s forces are continually joining this new Bolshevist army.  The Polesin Vilna and especially the National Democrats have of late been concerting with theRussian Bolshevists in Lithuania with a view to a  common action.                                    TURKEY.     The Grand Vizier complains of  the Greeks. Admiral Calthbrpe  reported on the19th March  [No.&apos; 580] that  he had exchanged visits with the  grand vizier  on theprevious day.   The latter  dwelt on the conduct of the  Greeks and their propaganda,and  urged that if  the  Greeks  continued  their  intrigues no responsibility for anything that might occur could be fairly attached  to his government, which was doing  every-thing it possibly could to prevent any incident.  The situation appeared to cause himgenuine and serious alarm.                                    ARMENIA,.  &apos;     The American Armenians and  Cilicia, On the 18th March Yahan  Cordeshian,telegraphing from  New York, reported that the Armenians at a mass meeting assembledto express the sense of the American Armenian colony concerning  the future politicalstatus of Cilicia, after having  heard  Messrs. James W. Gerard  and Abram I.  Elkus,adopted the following resolution :  .&apos;&apos;,&apos;&apos;..&quot;     Whereas Cilicia constitutes a political and geographical part of Armenia   ....and whereas the creation of an Armenia without Cilicia would  be an indefensible act ofinjustice, violating specific pledges made by the Entente to the Armenians, a. deliberatecondemnation of Armenia to political and economic strangulation, and a certain element of disturbance of the peace of the near East ; resolved that we demand the inclusion ofCilicia in the Armenian  state, and that we decline to accept any and  all propositionswhich do not provide for the inclusion of Cilicia in Armenia.                             SYRIA  AND ARABIA.    Sir Mark Sykes. --On the  24th February, the  municipality  of Aleppo summoneda meeting to honour the memory of the late  Sir  Mark  Sykes, to  which all the arab and  British authorities  were  invited.   The  opening speech of Mr. Ameen Gorayeb,assistant military governor was as follows :     This is a sad and grievous  occasion !  He whom we hailed but a few weeks agoas our  greatest  friend,  the father of  our  independence, has  passed away, neverto return !    Sir Mark  Sykes, the friend  of everybody in  this country, the man  who devotedhis last and best years to rocking the cradle of our nation,  has suddenly gone from usin the most delicate and perilous  days  of our national  life !   Of course, at  this timeof distress, our first thought, one of deep and  heartfelt  sympathy, is  for her whom hehas left behind, and to the family  which for the last three  years  was deprived  of thedelight of his company, for our sake, and is now deprived of it for  ever.  But we Arabshave lost in  him  one of the strongest pillars of our independence, one of  the mostprominent  and  indefatigable champions  of  our  liberty,  a man  of strong character,indomitable will,  inflexible  moral power,  boundless intellectual  resources,  and thekeenest  sense of duty.    Personally,  I  had  the  precious chance  of being constantly  in close  touch withhim during bis stajr in this city, having been  his  confidential  interpreter, and anotherclose relationship sprang up between us  when he became godfather  to my only child.  Ihad then ample opportunity of watching  the  vigour with which he carried  out his self-chosen duty;  and I still regard with amazement and  wonder the absolute concentration of  his thought  on the realization of  his aim, and  the sleepless  nights spent at  hisdesk over documents dealing with  the  Arab  cause  which God, in His goodness, badmade dear to his heart.   I remember too the dreary winter days when he  never had a fixed time for  meals, never a moment for recreation, never a  thought for anything butthe success of his humane mission.    And living this strenuous life, he had ever a winning smile on his gentle face  forone and all, and a ready wit which never  failed him.  Nor do I  forget the  sonorousquality of his manly voice when he was  illuminating one or  other of  the problems ofife, or giving out from that store  of information which  he alone knew where to seekand how to gather.      [756]-423   .  ,                              .&apos;                   B 2
     We Arabs can, indeed, ill afford to lose such a friend  in these momentous days.The horrors of oppression to which we were subjected at the hands of the Turks  is theonly possible measure of the value of the work he  did for us.  And his death, comingas it has done in these early days of our national infancy, could  only be regarded as apublic calamity, little short of disaster, were it not for  the hope, deep-rooted, in ourhearts, that the land which gave us  Sir Mark Sykes still holds  for us many anothersincere friend like him, many a large heart like to his.     The recognition of the work done for  the Arabs by  Sir  Mark Sykes has not been confined to Aleppo.  On another page it is recorded that the King of Hejaz instructeda Syrian gentleman to represent him at the  Eequiem  in Westminster cathedral, andhis majesty had already sent a telegram of condolence to  Lady Sykes.  Similar telegrams,and letters  expressing  admiration and gratitude for   his devoted work in the Arabcause have poured in from all parts of the civilized world.     Syrians and the French.  On the. 18th March General  Clayton reported [No. 74]that there had been a demonstration at Damascus for the purpose of protesting againstM.  Pichon s speech, and that the demonstration had been followed by the presentation of between  300 and 400 petitions  in the following sense :-     Putting on one side all differences of caste and religion, Syrian and other inhabitants of the  territory which had been liberated united in declaring that there was absolutelyno  foundation  for the claim of secular rights put forward by France, and that theycould  not  allow  that any nation  had any  right  within the  boundaries of  Syria.No right over the inhabitants,  their liberty, or  their  national  independence could bededuced from business relations based on freedom of commerce.     Every politician of note had declared that the war  had been fought for the libertiesof peoples and the cancellation of such treaties as compromised the  liberties of smallnations and  for no other  end :  and that  being so they could recognise  no treaties made without their consent.   When their nation joined the  allies it  did so solely  to fight for  its own  independence : and  the allies were looked  to  for  help  in procuring itsindependence and in the  defence of its  rights.  As  for the declaration of M. Pichonthey protested against it heart and soul.     Reported massacre  of Armenians. Telegraphing on  the   20th  March admiral calthorpe reported  [No.  598] having received  visits from the heads of the threeArmenian communities, who said that they had  received information, from,persons whohad left Aleppo on the 8th March, that there had been a massacre in that town on the28th February ; the result  being that 47 Armenians were killed and 260 wounded, 110of them severely, whilst  53 others  were missing.     They further said that the Turks were arming the  Moslem population of Diarbekr,Sivas,and other places with a view to further massacres, though ostensibly for protection against the Armenians    In the  opinion  of  Admiral Calthorpe&apos;s visitors these outrages were inspired  by the C.U.P.HEJAZ.     The King&apos;s Subsidy. Lord Curzon informed  [No.  360] Sir Milne Cheetham on the20th March  that King  HussehTs subsidy for the month, of April would  be 80,0001.instead of 120,0001.  If  a demand were made for a larger sum for succeeding months itwas essential that fuller details should be given  of the proposed expenditure.ASIR.     Idrisi&apos;s Subsidy. On the 19th  March Sir Milne Cheetham reported [No. 409] thata recommendation had  been  received  from the  resident at Aden that the amount ofIdrisi&apos;s subsidy should be. reconsidered after June, but that for each of the next threemonths (April, May, and June), the sum of 7.000Z. should  be paid as heretofore.   SirMilne  Cheetham said  that he concurred  in the amount but would  prefer its be ingtreated as a final lump sum paid in instalments.   Idrisi fully realized that the departure of the Turks determined his claim  to a. regular subsidy ; but he greatly needed present financial help.  Sir  Milne Cheetham agreed with the resident at Aden and CommanderHogarth, R.N.V,E. that., he,, deserved  our  consistent help in the future ; his behaviourthroughout  the evacuation had been unexceptional.
PERSIA.    The general outlook.-Telegraphing on the  20th March [No. 208]  Sir  Percy Coxreported that, speaking generally, the  outlook  for the success of our  policy  was most favourable.   Both in the capital and in the provinces,  during the past few months thepolitical atmosphere had completely changed, intrigue against the cabinet had practicallydisappeared, and  public opinion in the capital was  gradually veering round to us.  Allthings were possible, he said, if we could maintain the present  cabinet in power andwould help it as far as lay in our power.
