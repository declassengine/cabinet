APPRECIATION OP  ME  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXIII.                                    RUSSIA.    The formation of a Government in Siberia is to be noted as being a sign of a return to non-Bolshevik ideas.  It  is possible,  however, that this is  only  anothertransient phantom.                                    ARABIA.    The Hejaz messages for His Majesty the King, the Commander-in-chief in France,and the Lord Mayor are interesting.   (See press Friday and Saturday next.)    The decision to send delegates from Mecca to the Caucasus is also an event  worth noting.M. S.April 11, 1918.I K98-90]

The Meets.-Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 3rd April  [No.  70] that the  black sea fleet was very  short of men and in a bad  way, but M. Trotsky was fully alive to thenecessity of restoring its capacity for  fighting.   The  new admiral, Sablin,  had  been ordered to restore discipline at all costs,  and he was said  to be a strong man.   He was allowed to choose his own assistants and had  been given considerable power.     It was admitted by M. Trotsky  that the Baltic fleet was not likely to be of greatuse against the Germans ; it had been withdrawn to Cronstadt, and would be destroyedshould the necessity arise.     The  Knights  of  St.  George JE.R.  LXII,  p.  2].-Mr.  Balfbur telegraphed toSir G. Barclay on the 6th April [No.  195] that the question of conferring the cross onthe King should be allowed to drop,  or  if this should be impossible that he should letit be understood that at present  it would be better not  to pursue the  proposal.  Itwould be difficult for His Majesty to  accept a Russian decoration.THE  KRIVOI-ROG  REPUBLIC^     Ukraina and the Republic. The following proclamation of the president and three other of the  people&apos;s  commissaries  of the Krivoi-Rog  republic appeared  in theAdmiralty Wireless Press of the 3rd  April :.      The Government of the Kiev Radalias forcibly passed the frontiers of our Krivoi-Rogrepublic on  the Bon,  and  at   the  same time  that  that Government offers  to the       * Krivoi-Rog  is in the government of Kherson, close to the border of that of Ekaterinoslav.       [898-90]                                                            B
government of the federal Russian republic to stop the present fratricidal war andto enter upon negotiations for a democratic peace,  as though  it were at war  against  i.Great Russia but not against the workmen and peasants of our republic !    - The Kiev Government is  willing to consider as a democratic peace, as a peace cometo by agreement and without  violence, only a peace  under  which  the territory of ourKrivoi-Rog republic on the Don may be  invaded  by troops of the Kiev Government,and the  will of the  people  of our republic  may  be  suppressed by the  might ofGerman and Austrian bayonets.  We, the Government of the  republic, declare thatthere can be no peace  without the recognition of our republic by both sides.     With arms in their hands, the people of our republic  revolted  against the  KievGovernment, which is submerging our country with German troops,  and we  shall notlay down our arms as  long as  those troops are in the territory of our republic.  Beforethe force  of  bayonets we may retire, but we shall not acquiesce so long as a yard of ourterritory  remains in our hands and there is a man to  bear arms.   We declare that theKiev Government,  whilst  conquering our republic by  Germano-Austrian bayonets,cannot, consistently  with  historic  or  any  other  rights,  justify  itself.  The  KievGovernment must  be aware  that our state  has  existed since  the first days of thedeposition of the  dynasty of  the  Romanoffs and  as  a republic since  the  Octoberresolution.   The Kiev Government must be aware that at the congress of the councilson the 25th  February, 1918, the population of this region declared itself an autonomousstate of the  federal  Russian counciPs republic,  and that, on the  28th February aGovernment of this  republic was established.  The  frontiers  of this republic must be known to the Kiev  Government.  Only a few months ago the Kiev  Rada in its treaty with Prince Lvoff and M. Tereshtchenko established the eastern  frontiers of  Ukraina,winch have been and are also  the western frontiers of our republic.     The western frontiers of the governments of Kharkov and  Ekaterinoslav, includingthe railway  system  of the  Krivoi-R,og within the government  of Kherson,  and thegovernment  of  Tauride to  the  isthmus  have always been and  still  are the westernfrontiers of our republic.  The Asov Sea to Taganrog and the frontiers of the councilscoalfields  of the Don region to the railway line Rostov-Voronezh Slihay,  the  westernfrontiers of the government of Voronezh,  and the southern frontiers of the governmentof Kursk form the frontiers of our republic.  Excepting that the object is plunder, it isnot possible to explain the acts of the Kiev  Government.   We propose in the name ofour republic to the federation of the councils of the people&apos;s commissaries of the republicto accept  the proposal  of the Kiev Government for the  starting of peace negotiationsonly upon the condition that the Kiev Government will stop immediately the advance&apos;of the Germano-Austrian troops  which,  in the  name of the Kiev Government, areinvading  our republic.   We proposf**that  there should  be  an  armistice with ourautonomous  republic for  the  purpose of peace  negotiations and  the demarcation of frontiers.                                -,&apos; .&apos;..CAUCASUS.    Moslems in the Caucasus and Pan-Islamism. Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 283]on the 7th April a message from  the intelligence  officer in the Caucasus, in the courseof which the latter said that Pan-Islamism had so far not taken any great hold of thepeople.  Stchikin  had, he said,  stated that at  heart  the  Moslems of the  Caucasuspreferred the Russians to the Turks ; and that a show  of force at Enzeli and  Kasvinwas all that was necessary to prevent the growth of Pan-Islamism.SIBERIA.     A New Government.- -MM. Derber and Moravsky telegraphed  from Harbin on the7th April saying that a Siberian  provincial duma (composed of representatives of thezemstvos  and co-operative societies  and other public organisations  and nationalities)had organised a  Government for autonomous Siberia.  The immediate aims of this government were, first, the establishment  of legal order and  the  securing of  personalproperty ;  secondly, active opposition to the Bolsheviks in order  to establish  the legalpower of the all-Russian Constituent Assembly ; thirdly, the defence  of the political and economical independence and the territorial integrity of Siberia;  fourthly, the  meetingof an all-Siberian Constituent Assembly; fifthly,  active resistance  to the Bolshevik-German  peace, together with  the  allied Powers,  in  order to  conclude  a  generaldemocratic peace ; sixthly, the  re-establishment  of good  relations with the  alliedfriendly Powers, based on existing treaties and agreements ; seventhly,  the  taking of
 measures to counteract any further German advance into-,Russian territory.   In under- taking these difficult and responsible  tasks the  Government of autonomous  Siberia acknowledged that it would be only able to accomplish them if energetically assisted by the Allies ;  and it  was fully convinced  that it would receive such assistance  from England, with whose interests the aims of the Siberian Government coincided.     The Prisoners of War [E.R. LXII, p. 2]. Sir C. Greene telegraphed from Tokio on the 4th April [No. 325] transmitting a message from the military attache, who said that Lieutenant-Colonel Maund had arrived from Moscow by way of  vladivostock.   He had reported a statement of the British  consul at Irkutsk to the effect that a German major-general, 2 colonels, and  34 other  ranks had recently come to  that place for the purpose of organising a  large concentration of armed prisoners there.  Colonel Maund also said that there were but few sympathisers with the Bolsheviks among the Germans, but many among the Austrians.     On the  6th April  Sir  J.  Jordan transmitted from Pekin [No.  314]  a message dated  the 4th  April from Mr.  Porter,  who said that he had  met the Bolshevik leader Lazo,  who had  stated that,  with the  exception of some  Magyars at  Omsk  of Prussian origin,, who had elected  to become Russian subjects, no prisoners of war had been armed anywhere ; as to this having been done in the Transbaikal area, he  had given a most formal denial.  He  had added that the  civil war in Siberia had  ceased,  the  only- disturbing factor being SemenofTs Cossacks.                                   ROUMANIA     The Russian Proposals  \ E.R. LI I, p.  2, and above, p.  1]. On the 6th April. Lord Bertie transmitted [No. 479]  a telegram  sent from Jassy by the four Ministers on the previous day.   The Ministers said that the French consul-general at Moscow had been informed by M. Tcbitcherin  in regard to  a proposal for the settlement of the dispute with Roumania.   So far  as the allied representatives  were  concerned, the proposal appeared to be out of harmony with the situation as it was at present.  It had come too late.   The  Roumanian  Government  and  the  Sovyets of Sevastopol and Odessa  had already settled  one point of controversy, that regarding the exchange of hostages and persons interned.   The allied action in regard to the dispute between Roumania and the Maximalists had been  inspired by anxiety to make possible  the revictualling of the Roumanian army and its eventual retreat into Russia-, and so  enabling it to prolong its resistance.     Agreement with the Bolsheviks  of Odessa. -Sir  G.  Barclay telegraphed  on  the 6th April [No. 284] that the agreement for the exchange of prisoners, referred to above,&quot;had been brought about by Colonel Boyle.   In addition to  the exchange of prisoners, it- provided that  the  Roumanian troops should gradually - evacuate Bessarabia,  with  the exception of 10,000 men who would be left as  a guard on Roumanian provision depots and the railway line.  Colonel Boyle regarded the  conflict as quite settled.     Threatened Internment of  the French Military- Mission. On the 5th April Lord Bertie transmitted [No. 478]  a telegram from the four Ministers,  who said that they had  been unofficially informed by the Minister  of &quot;War that the  military delegate at Bukarest  had  sent  telegrams  from  which  it appeared that the internment of the members of  the French  military mission was  contemplated.   In accordance  with  the undertaken  given by the central  Powers, they should be repatriated, as they had been unable to leave with the other  missions,  and the  Ministers intended to approach M. Marghiloman with a view to settling  the incident on the basis of assurances given by his predecessor in office.     On the 8th April Lord Bertie  transmitted  [No. 493] another  message  from the allied  Ministers, who said that M. Marghiloman had promised that the question of repatriation should  be  treated  with due  regard  to  the  assurances  which had  been given.                                     ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Mission to the Caucasus and Turkestan. On the 1st March Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 300] to Sir R, Wingate suggesting that the King of&apos;  Hejaz should  send delegates to Turkestan and the Caucasus with a view to influencing  the Moslems in those regions in favour of the allies.   On the 5th March Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed fNo. 440] that        [898-90]                                                        B2
he would put the matter  before King Hussein;  and  on the  5th  April  he reported[No. 6361 that the latter would send three delegates.   The chief one would be SuleimanAzhar, who had been mutawef to the pilgrims from Turkestan and had the reputation of being an influential man and a good speaker.  The other  two would be chosen  bySuleiman Azhar.  Sir  It. Wingate  added  that, subject to  Mr. Balfour&apos;s approval,  hewould ask that the delegates should be sent to Cairo, where he would  be  able to give them any special instructions.  Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed  on the 8th April [No. 499]signifying his approval.Asm..     Monetary  help  for  Idrisi  [E.R.  LXI,  p.  2]. Replying to  a telegram  fromMr.  Balfour [No.  473],  expressing  some doubts in  connection with  this  matter,Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on the 5th April [No. 634] that in a recent encounter withthe Turks Idrisi had lost three of his best sheykhs together  with more  than thirtyothers killed and wounded.   If funds  were not  forthcoming  he  would  probably  be prevented from further action, and the Resident at Aden urged that help should  begiven without delay.   With this advice Sir R. Wingate agreed.  Mr. Tippets had beenlent by the Sudan Government to act as  liaison officer,  and he would  be able to  check the use of funds supplied by us.                                    PERSIA.     The Bakhtiari Khans. On the 25th March Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 250]certain proposals in  connection with  the  Bakhtiari khans.   Mr. Balfour replied on the30th March [No. 175]  asking  for further information;  and  Sir C. Marling telegraphedagain on  the 1st April  [No.  269].   The  latter  proposed to  influence  the Bakhtiarichiefs individually ; this, he said, was a matter of necessity,  as  they were not acting in concert.  The best course, he thought, would be to secure the  support  of Sirdar Jang(whom he regarded as the straightest of the khans) and Sirdar Mohtasham by holding out  to them the prospect of lucrative governorships  if they  maintained the presentIlkhani in  power.  samsam--es-Su!taneh (who  might be  a   possible  candidate for thepremiership if this cabinet went out) was greatly influenced by his son, who was a rabidpro-German, but he was avaricious and might be moved by money.   Sirdar Assad wasin the present cabinet, whose resistance to a compromise with us he actively supported;but in regard to tribal matters, he had professed for  some time past a wish to conform to our desires.   In any case, with the, Ilkhani,  Sirdar Jang, and Sirdar Mohtasham  on .our side, we could afford to treat him  with  coldness.  Mr.  Balfour telegraphed again  onthe 6th April ;No.  189]  that  he left the  matter  to Sir  Charles Marling&apos;s discretion,adding  that it was desirable that  commitments to the khans named should be as smallas possible.                                AFGHANISTAN.     Alleged  Mission to  Bokhara  and  Tashkend  [E.R.  LXII, p.  5 j. The Viceroytelegraphed on the 7th April that in  regard to  this matter he had had a message  fromSir George Macartney, who said that in a local Russian newspaper the  mission v,as described as consisting of an &quot;Afghan rajah&quot; and. eleven followers.  Sir George thoughtthat the  &quot; Afghan rajah&apos;/ might be Mahindra Patrap, and the eleven followers his Sikh,soldiers; he  doubted the existence of any Afghan mission.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                  ROUMANIA.     Bessarabia. On the  10th  April Lord  Bertie  transmitted  [No. 503] a message from  the  allied  Ministers  at  Jassy,  who  said  that M. Marghiloman  had  left forKishingeff in connection with the proposed union of Bessarabia with Roumania, which seemed to be imminent.                                  PALESTINE.     German Institutions. General Clayton telegraphed on the 9th April I No. LB. 1122],that it was  proposed to deal with German  scholastic and missionary institutions  asfollows:      1. Close inspection  would be instituted  in regard to the  curriculum and  general           conduct of schools primarily  intended for the children of German residents           in  German  colonies;  and  for the future these  schools would  be restricted           to  the children  of German parents, no natives being admitted.     2. German Jewish  schools would be dealt with by the Zionist Commission, which           would be approached  with a view to the reconstitution of these schools  on           pro-ally lines.     3. A board  of control nominated by  the Commander-in-chief would  control  all           Protestant schools and orphanages for native  children; this  board would           substitute an allied staff for the  existing German one, and would eradicate           German influence   The  Syria and Palestine Relief Committee would have           a strong representation on this council, and it was being approached with a           view to its taking over all financial obligations.     4. Arrangements were being made in consultation with M. Picot and the guardian           of the Franciscans for dealing in a  similar manner with similar  Roman           Catholic schools.     The  Case of Mrs.  Cohen. In  reply  to  an  enquiry  from  the Foreign  Office,General  Clayton telegraphed  on the  8th  April ! No.   LB.  1124] in  regard  toMrs. Ephraim Cohen, the  headmistress of a  German school  in  Jerusalem.  She is aGerman  Jewess,  and her  husband  was the local chief representative of the Hilfs-Verein (headquarters in Berlin) to which her school belonged.   He  had been living  inGermany.   The  Cohens had been instrumental in securing the exile  of a  numberof allied subjects, and their house had been the rendezvovrs  of Jemal Pasha  and  of dr. Subsfer.  Mrs. Cohen and her daughter would shortly be evacuated to  Malta, ordershaving been given for their internment.                                    PERSIA.     Attack on Armenians. Information lias been received of an attack on Armeniansat Zencljan,  a  place to the south-west of Resht, on  the 25th March; three were killed and four wounded.o
