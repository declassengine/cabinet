According  to  an  intercepted wireless message, at the  firstmeeting of the newly-elected Petrograd soviet, only Communist candidates were elected members of the executive  committee, in  spite of the fact that 200 non-party delegates were present. .  Mr. Zinovieff was elected  president.     Soviet Military Revolutionary Committee. A wireless message was sent out from moscow on the  9th July stating that, according to information supplied by Mr.  Smilga,Mr.  Trotsky  is president  of the  military revolutionary  committee,  Mr.  Sklyanskyvice-president, Mr.  Smilga head of the  political  administration, Mr.  Rikoff controller of supplies, Mr. Guseff commissary of field headquarters, and Mr. Xameneff commander-in-chief.   In  regard to the  last  mentioned Mr.  Smilga  is  stated to have spoken asfollows :      He is a colonel of the  former general staff.  When the former army was disbandedhe  held  the post of chief of  staff, to  which he had been  appointed by  the Sovietgovernment.  On  the demobilization of the former army he at  once joined the red army, where  he held the  post  of commander-in-chief of the  Reval sector, commander of a division, and, later,  commander  on  the eastern front.   As commander  on this front he showed himself in the highest degree talented and capable.  He conscientiouslystudied the best way of carrying on civil war.  As regards politics, he showed  himselfentirely loyal to the Soviet government  and completely honest in his dealings.  I am confident that his appointment as commander-in-chief is a step forward in the work of construction of  our army.     Alleged Defeat of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Troops. According to a wireless message, ofwhich there has been no official confirmation, a message of the  12th July from Moscow to
 Tashkend states that three regiments of the first Siberian division, the best of Admiral Fvolchak&apos;s divisions, surrendered to the Bolsheviks  in  the Perm district, where  the latter took 20,000 prisoners and enormous booty.     A Vatican Appeal  to  Mr. Lenin. According to  the  &quot; Wireless  Press,&quot;  the following message was sent by Cardinal Gasparri, papal secretary of state, to Mr. Lenin on the 13th July :  We learn from a  sure source that Monsignor Bopp, catholic archbishop of Mohilew, has been  for  some months  in  prison  at Petrograd.   This  sad  news  has deeply pained  the  holy  father, who  trembles for  the actual  life  of  the  venerable prelate, chiefly on account of  his advanced  age,  his shattered health, and the severe sufferings which he must be undergoing at the moment.   His holiness appeals to your feelings of humanity, and implores you to give instructions for the unhappy archbishop to be set  at liberty as soon as  possible. TURKESTAN.                       -     Conditions  in Bokhara. On the 12th July, the. viceroy telegraphed  a  summary of reports received from General Malleson to the effect  that there  was great tension - in Bokhara between the inhabitants and the Bolsheviks : in some places  the mullahs were inciting a jehad  against the latter.  The Bokharans ridiculed  the  Bolshevik  stories of Afghan victories, the Afghans being very unpopular with them.     Conditions  round about Tashhend. On the  same date, the 12th  July, the viceroy also transmitted a report from General Malleson in regard  to the  country round about Tashkend.  The conditions there were, he said, very much disturbed  : gangs of armed men were robbing  travellers.   Forcible enlistment^ by  the Bolsheviks  was  also causing some unrest.                                  LITHUANIA.     Poles and Lithuanians. Telegraphing  from Libau on the.  11th July, Mr. Grant Watson reported [No. 179] that he had been informed  by the  minister of commerce that on the  6th  and 7th July the Poles had advanced  towards Kowno from Vilna  and that in the course  of the movement, near Kochedary, there had been  fighting between them and the Lithuanians.  The latter stated that an  announcement had been made by the Poles of  their  intention to occupy Kowno on Tuesday last.   The  Lithuanians had been  obliged to withdraw their troops  from the Bolshevik front, to  the west of Dwinsk, in  consequence of the Poles having sent troops, 6,000  in number, to   the Lithuanian front.     A Coalition Government. On the 14th July Mr. Grant Watson reported [No. 188] that a coalition government had been accepted by the people&apos;s council.                                   BUM AN I A.     Mr. Bratiano. Telegraphing from Bucharest on the 7th July [No.  347] Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 347] that Mr. Bratiano had arrived the night before from Paris.  He had made no official  statement, but the general impression was  that he had every intention of remaining in  power.  Mr.  Rattigan, however, said that he did not see how  he could do so if he refused to sign the peace treaty with  Austria.                                   TURKEY.     The Grown  Prince. On the 8th July Admiral Calthorpe reported [No. 1420] that the crown prince had lately had some very stormy interviews with the sultan; he was, the admiral said, becoming more and more the head of  a faction opposed  to  both  the sultan and the government. ASIA MINOR.     The  General  Situation  in Western Asia  Minor. On  the  8th   July  Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed [Nos. 1419 and 1420] in regard to the general  situation in Asia Minor.  He said that the Turkish government was well aware of the extent to which the Greeks had overstepped the limits prescribed for them by the peace conference, andthat the Italian  occupation was also causing it serious misgivings.   The only conclusion it could arrive at was that the  supreme   council  really wished to give the Greeks  and italians a  free hand, and nothing could contribute more to the success of  the national
o3258movement which already threatened to take the shape of open defiance to the centralgovernment in Constantinople and to the allies.     The sultan had sent the grand vizier and the minister of foreign affairs to repre-sent to him  the impossible situation then existing.  They read telegraphic accounts ofoutrages in the Smyrna district (the general tenour of which Admiral Calthorpe-saidwas confirmed by  British officers),  and  requested  in the name of the  sultan  thatBritish officers should be attached to  the Greek troops  to  watch and when necessarycontrol  their  actions, and further that he,  the  sultan, should be informed as to the slimits assigned to the Greek occupation by the peace conference.     Greek  Restrictions  of  Trade. On  the 12th  July Admiral Calthorpe reported[No. 1451] as follows:.      Information has been  received from Smyrna to the effect that the Greek army ofoccupation has prohibited the export of foodstuffs and other articles from the coast of theGreek occupied territory.   This prohibition  is reported  to  include interior  commerceviz.  transit  by rail  of supplies from the vilayets viz. Smyrna  to  Constantinople andother Ottoman centres,  as well as shipments by sea from one Ottoman port to another.     It  is submitted in the interests of  trade that export prohibitions on the coast of greek occupied territory should be drawn up as  in all other Turkish ports by thecentral  Turkish imports  and exports  commission at  Constantinople, which works inconjunction  with the inter-allied commission, and that the commerce  of Turkey shouldbe free of Greek control.  This last point is of vital importance as regards  the suppliesof the empire.     My colleagues are in  entire agreement with the  above and are  telegraphing in thesame sense to their governments.  We suggest that joint action be taken at Athens.     The Greek Occupation of Aidin.-On the 9th July Admiral Calthorpe transmitted[No. 1423] the following message, sent from Smyrna on the 7th July by Mr. Morgan :      The  Greek high commissioner  acknowledged to  the commodore  to-day that there-occupation of Aidin  by the  Greeks without permission was wrong, and  stated thatMr. Venezelos, by whose orders the re-occupation took  place, was of  the same opinionbut he would explain things to the Paris conference.     He said that prestige rendered  it  necessary and stated  that  no advance would bemade towards Nazali.   He  stated that during the Turkish  occupation of Aidin, manyGreeks were massacred.     Half the fig crop will be lost  this year and other exports will  suffer. owing tointerior trouble and flight of peasants.     On  the 12th July Admiral Calthorpe transmitted  [No.  1450]  another message,dated the 10th July, from Mr.  Morgan, who said that  Lieutenant Hodder had statedthat the Turks had murdered or burnt  400 Christians during the occupation of [?] Aidin.[See E.R. CXXVII1, p. 3, for  a report that during the Turkish occupation of Aidin,Christians had been well treated.]     Movements  of  the  Greek  Troops. On the  10th July  Admiral Calthorpe  trans-mitted [No. 1433] the following report from Commodore Fitzmaurice :-     The  Greek troops have crossed  the river south  of Aidin,  in spite of my orders tothe contrary, and were near Giovval on the 8th July, 20 miles southward of the river.     Shells fired by the Greek artillery fell inside the Italian lines.  The Italian generalofficer commanding has formally  protested  to me against both occurrences.   An  orderfrom  M.  Venizelos  is presumably  responsible for this contravention of orders.  I have written to  the  Greek high commissioner insisting that orders should be given that theGreek troops should be immediately  withdrawn to the  north  of the Aidin railway.                                      SYRIA.     Emir Feisal and the American Commissioners. On the 10th July Colonel French,telegraphing from Cairo, reported [No. 378] that a week earlier Emir Feisal had had an interview with the  American commissioner.     In reply to an inquiry as to the existence of anti-French propaganda, Emir Feisalsaid that French propaganda and  French  methods were mainly responsible for whatthere had been.  He attributed the feeling  against the French to the bad impressionproduced by French methods and administration in the western zone, to a fear that the
  exploitation  of Syrian markets and man  power in the interests of France would result  from a French mandate, and bo the fear of French colonial methods as shewn in Algiers. .;  and  Tunis.   He informed  the commissioner  that  if Great  Britain had shown the-  slightest sign of any willingness to accept a mandate there would have been an over-  whelming majority in favour of giving it to her.      There was a very strong feeling that all the Arab countries, including Mesopotamia,  should be under the influence of the same power : the movement towards union and0  independence was entirely racial and not religious in character.  In regard to Syria in  particular, separation from Palestine would not be acceptable.      As to Zionism, some months  ago he had stated that he was prepared to accept it  to  a certain  extent; that is a  certain  expansion of  the existing Jewish colony.  He  found however that  the people would haA&apos;e none of it;  the wider  Zionist aspirations  had frightened them.      In Mesopotamia he said that beyond doubt the English and their methods had  excited a certain amount of hostile feeling.      He  recognized that assistance was needed and  that there  must be some sort of  mandate.  As the mandatory power France was definitely rejected by the people : they  asked for America in  the first place, and, failing America, Great Britain America was  put first because it was  feared  that Great Britain would refuse if the  mandate were  offered her.   Those who asked for complete  independence  did  not  do so in the belief  that they could stand on their own, but as a protest against too complete a control.      Commenting on the  statement  made  by the emir  in  regard to the  Syrian  independence party, Colonel French said  it hardly tallied with the  facts of the  case :  the  extremists were fully prepared  to attempt complete  independence and were  quite  indifferent as to  what the result of their experiments on the  country might be.      He said too that the Syrian dislike of the  idea of France as mandatory was due  to the commercial exclusiveness of the latter, and the  French disregard of national  feeling.  It was  felt that development of the people and all progress would be stopped  if France had the mandate.                                     ARABIA.      Mr.  Philby s Mission. On the  14th July Lord Curzon  telegraphed to General  Allenby [No. 841] in regard to  Mr.  Philby&apos;s mission.  He said that  Mr.  Philby should  at once return to London, and later on the advisability  of  his  proceeding to Riadh in  the autumn would be considered.      The primary object of the  proposed mission had been, he said, to induce Ibn  Saud  to stop his advance and  that  object  appeared  to have been achieved : unless  King  Hussein should give further provocation there appeared to be no likelihood of Ibn Saud&apos;s  advance  being continued.  The securing  of the withdrawal of Ibn Saud&apos;s forces was  to be a secondary object of the mission, a preliminary  step to the arbitration we  were  prepared to undertake ;  but as King Hussein refused our help the only thing to be done  was  to withdraw  our offer.      King Hussein. On  the  14th July  Lord  Curzon  instructed  General  Allenby  [No. 841] to inform King Hussein that, in consequence of his refusal of our help our offer  to arbitrate was retracted, and  also to withdraw the aeroplanes which were no longer  required.                                    ARMENIA.      Appointment of American  High  Commissioner.- On the 10th  July Lord Curzon  informed Sir Percy Cox [No. 380] and Admiral Calthorpe [No. 1156], that the supreme  council in Paris  had  appointed Colonel  Haskell to take full  charge of all the  relief  organizations  operating in  Armenia and  to  act  as   high   commissioner  for  the  governments of France, Italy, Great Britain, and the United States.   Colonel Haskell  belonged to the United States army.
