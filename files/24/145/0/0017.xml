SECRET.67APPRECIATION OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  NO.  LXXVII.I                                     RUSSIA.    This week&apos;s telegrams tend  to  clear  up the situation a  little.   The Bolsheviks jndently continue to hold Moscow and Petrograd strongly.  So far as these centres are foncerned, the anti-Bolshevik action  has been a failure.   The best cry the Bolsheviks lave is  plainly that  of &quot; No  war under any circumstances.&quot;   The  Petrograd cholera epidemic is  evidently serious, but need not affect the political situation.  With the government in suck a chaotic state it is likely that the disease will spread, as there is DO organisation to prevent it.                                    ARABIA.    The friction between Ibn Saud and King Hussein is unsatisfactory and may develop rto a serious misunderstanding.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.    Special attention is drawn to  the letter of the son of a Hull Labour leader of someIminence ; it is very satisfactory and should be the basis of a good line  of propaganda.                                     PERSIA.    The situation continues to be  menacing and uncertain.                             PALESTINE  (see Annex.)    This weeks report is very satisfactory, and the good tone indicates that the people are relieved by the failure of the Turco-German push  of a few days back.

On the 9th July Mr. Lockhart telegraphed [No. 329,;  received on the 13th July], that after  the murder  of Count  Mirbach the Left  SocialI Revolutionaries, wdio had clone the deed, had attempted to bring about a coup d&apos;etat, butI the revolt had been speedily crushed.  The leaders had fled to the provinces where theyI would work against the Bolsheviks.   M. Chicherin  had stated that he had received anI assurance from the  Germans that they had no intention of advancing as they did not  blame the Government.   A  fierce  campaign  was being waged against us,  and  in an1  official proclamation the murder had been attributed to agents  of the allies.   No French;  or English  could leave the  country by way, of Archangel or Murman :  members of;  Mr.  Lockhart&apos;s staff even had been refused passports.      The Russian Government sent out the following wireless message on the 9th  July:1 The conspiracy of the Revolutionary Socialists of the Left against the authority of thel Councils  may  be regarded  as  suppressed.    Order  is  re-established  at Moscow.I Petrograd and the  provinces have manifested no reaction to these proceedings.   It isI clear that this conspiracy was prepared  with  care  at secret meetings of the centralj committee of the party of the Revolutionary Socialists of  the Left.  It was expected;J that this  coup d&apos;etat would succeed, according to a statement by  Popov, chief of theif army extraordinary  commission and a member of their party, who had his illusions as\ regards  the attitude of  certain regiments.  At the  present  time all  the  forces are dispersed after a short resistance  and many of  the  leaders of the  party, like  Karelin,I Kamkov, Cherepanov, Sabalin, and Proshvanin, have fled.   But Madame  Spiridonova,I with other members of the fifth congress of the party, have been arrested.  The council I of the People&apos;s Commissioners  has appointed k special commission under the  presidencyI of the People&apos;s Commissioner for Justice, Stutchka, to make a minute&quot; investigation.      Telegraphing on the 10th July [No. 330] Mr. Lockhart said that most of  the leadersI of the revolt had been captured, and the revolt itself completely suppressed. M. TrotskyI had made a long speech in the Congress (which had reopened on the previous day), inI the course of which he condemned the Left Social Revolutionaries a,s traitors,  and  addedI that Prussia would certainly not allow herself to  be dragged  into a war by any  imperialistI Government.
     Soviet Congress  and  Foreign  Policy. The Russian  Government  sent out thefollowing  wireless message  on the  12th  July:  On the 8 th July, 1918, the followingresolution was passed by the majority  on the  proposal of the Communists :  The  fifthcongress of workmen&apos;s and  peasants&apos; deputies entirely approves the home and foreignpolicy of the Council of the People&apos;s  Commissioners, and again affirms that it will not involve  the country in a fresh war.  Russia of the Councils will resist every aggressiveattempt within Russian territory which may be made by any imperialistic Government.Russia of the Councils will show no  mercy to enemies who  betray their country in theinterests of any coalition of nations.     The congress also approved the present food policy and the creation  of  committeescomposed  of poor peasants. ...     The congress appeals to all workmen and peasants to rally round the CounciPsauthority.     The Germans and Moscow. M. Chicherin sent the following wireless message to therepresentatives of the Russian Government abroad :  Absurd rumours are being spread,with a provocative purpose, to the effect that we have consented to the entry of german troops into Moscow.   Let it be known that we shall never consent to the entry of foreigntroops into Moscow.  Further, Germany does not demand anything of the sort.  Refutethese deliberately false rumours.     General Conditions in Petrograd and Moscow. Two days before the above messagewas sent out, the  Russian  Government  issued  the  following,  which  was signed&quot; Feinburg &quot; : Preconceived notions of the appearance of a great city during a revolution,together with the lurid tales of English press correspondents, increased one&apos;s astonishmenton entering Petrograd.   The town presented  a  strikingly normal appearance.  At thestation  tried guards  are at the  entrances  and exits.   Outside there is little on  the surface to indicate that the greatest social conflict in  the world&apos;s history is being foughtout here.  In the thoroughfares  droshkies and  the trams are running.  In the NevskyProspect crowds of people  are promenading.   Prosperousdooking  bourgeois  are taking their families for a walk, apparently not afraid of being robbed or murdered.   Vendorsare selling all sorts  of wares.  The first signs  of change came as a shock on  seeingfashionably dressed women at the street corners selling cigarettes, flowers, and sweets,obviously  for a livelihood.    In the official quarter  of the city definite signs of an upheaval  present themselves.Enter the great square of the  Winter Palace,  and you  see the brick of the red facadeclotted with bullet holes, which tell of grim conflict.   It is a glorious day, and to  the left are the gleaming golden domes of St.  Isaac&apos;s cathedral,  and  opposite  the  slendergolden spire of the Admiralty mast,  whilst high over the Winter Palace is the red flagof international Socialism.    Moscow presents  a similarly  orderly  appearance.   When  one  arrived there on sunday  there was a long queue at the  railway  station people  going to  the countryfor  the  day.  Here also were bustling crowds of hawkers.   The  armed  guards at different parts were not as  numerous as the policemen to be seen in London.    But  the outward appearance of the cities  gives a wrong impression  of the realsituation.   We must look deeper to  see the grim struggle which is going on in the citiesand towns of Russia.  There is no bread in Petrograd, and very little in Moscow.  Otherfoods are obtainable, but at very high prices.   The food problem will be critical duringthe next two months, but the harvest promises to be the  best for twenty years, and thiswill relieve the situation.   The enemies of the Soviet  Government are endeavouringto exploit the situation to overthrow . that  Government.   So far the attempts have proved an utter failure.     Cholera in Petrograd. The following wireless message was sent, on the 11th July,to the councils  of the  corn  provinces  and to  all  railway officials :  In  Petrograd,owing to  the very grave  shortage of food, cholera is on the  increase.   Every daymany hundreds of persons are falling victims to  the disease.   It is  impossible to do anything to combat the epidemic, and we are unable to furnish even a quarter of a poundof bread a day, and are forced to give herrings in place of bread.  It is very difficult tocarry on until the next harvest.   Help  us to do so by sending us corn and everythingyou can.   All kinds of food  are of the greatest importance.  We beg  the railway officials to clo everything in their power with the view to speeding up  the dispatch  of food toPetrograd.   It is the duty of the council of the corn  provinces to feed Petrograd.
369SIBERIA.    Another New Government. Sir J. Jordan! telegraphed [No. 596] on the 13th july summary of a proclamation by General Horvat.  It was, the general said,-in response to numerous requests that he had come forward to take control of the government ofSiberia, with the  assistance  of a working cabinet.  He  had assumed  the  title of provisional administrator and his cabinet would comprise MM. Taskin, Kurski, Vostrotin,Putilov, Ustrogof, Plug, and Okorokow ; and reuter says that these gentlemen willta,ke the following offices in the order named : Agriculture, Religious Affairs, Commerce,Finance, Communications, War, and Food.  MM. Vostrotin and Taskin were membersof the 3rd and 4th Dumas ;  M. Kurski, head of the co-operative association in WesternSiberia, and M.  Okorokow  one  of  its prominent members;   and  M.  Ustrugof,Vice-Minister of  Communications . in  the  former  provisional  Government.   Theprogramme of  the  new Government was : (l)  The  abolition  of all  Bolshevistlaws  and  ordinances.   (2)  Restoration  of legal  tribunals  and administrative  insthtutions, and  self-government by municipalities and Zemstvos.   (3)  Equality  at law of citizens  and  the maintenance  of  citizen  rights and  liberties.   (4) General rightof election.  (5)  Recognition of all former alliances, conventions, and  agreements withallied  and  neutral  countries,  also political  obligations  and  proprietorial  rights  of territory.   (6) Restoration of the army with the strictest discipline, without giving thearmy political rights.  (7) Restoration of the right of ownership  of  private property.(8) All land questions to be decided by the Constituent Assembly.   (9) Restoration ofcommerce  and  trade  by  the  abolition of the  nationalisation and  socialisation  ofcommercial  and  industrial  organisations.   (1.0)  Improvement  of  popular education.(11) Freedom of  religion. (12) Right of Siberia and other regions to exercise autonomyas part of United Russia.   The seat  of the new Government is, according to Reuter,temporarily located at  Grodekovo.                                    TURKEY.     Cause of the Sultan&apos;s Death. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 12th July [No.1156] that Dr. Parodi had been informed that typhoid was raging in Constantinople andthat the Sultan had been one of its victims.                                    ARABIA.     King Hussein and Ibn Saud. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate [No. 885]on the 1 5th  July informing him that instructions had been given that the followingmessage  from His  Majesty&apos;s Government should  be  communicated to Ibn Saud by anofficer deputed for the  purpose :  I am charged by my Government to deliver to  you this message of friendship  and goodwill,  even as  my  colleague, Colonel   Wilson, has beencharged to deliver the same  message to the King of Hejaz :       His Majesty&apos;? Government notes with regret  that the  letters  exchanged betweenthe two great leaders of the Arabian people show that there is between them a dangerof serious misunderstanding.   Should there cease to  be friendship  between them acalamity would  threaten the whole Arab people,  and there would  be no advantage toany but those who wish them ill.  His Majesty&apos;s Government appeals to both to showwisdom and forbearance.  A common enemy threatens the independence of the Arabs.How often have the Arabs lost their  independence  because being disunited they  were defeated by a Power which  could not otherwise have  conquered them ?  In  this age of world war,  misunderstanding between the Arabs would not only help the enemy to robthem of the liberties they have won,  but would impede the efforts which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is  making to  free those  who are still under  the yoke  of  the  Turkishoppressor.   His Majesty&apos;s Government is ready and willing to give any help to  the  two great Arab leaders which will assist them incoming to an agreement by negotiation.     Mr. Balfour  gave  instructions that a  similar  message mutatis mutandis should be delivered  to King Hussein.KOWEIT.     The Shaykh  and the Blockade. The Political Officer at Baghdad telegraphed on the8th July that on the 5th a message had been delivered to the  Shaykh of Koweit fromthe Government  of India.   The political agent told the Shaykh that  the  Governmentto  avoid   future misunderstandings  wished  to explain its  policy in  his regard,  andwelcomed his declaration as an opportunity for the re-establishment  of the traditional       [898-104]                                                       B  2
friendship, deeply regretting as it did the things which had happened at Koweit duringthe past two  years.  The Government of India would continue the assurances  and extend to the  Shaykh the friendship, assistance, and protection winch had been givento his father ;  if he on his part showed the same friendship and assistance which it  hadformerly experienced in its dealings with the rulers of Koweit.   And  with  this theGovernment hoped that the Shaykh  would  raise Koweit and the name of his house tothe high position in the thought  of the British  Government and.  the Arabian peopleswhich it had held in the past.     But on the other hand the Shaykh must be  held personally  responsible for any future acts contrary to  the interests  of the Government, committed either by his  ownsubjects or others  within his territories ; for it was  obviously the duty of a  ruler  of a friendly State to prevent such  acts.  The Government  realised that if he wished to do this it could be done, and hoped that the Shaykh would realise his responsibility andunderstand  that the prosperity of his State  depended  on the preservation of a  truefriendship with itself.     Subject to the Shaykh taking suitable measures to prevent the  sending of supplies to the enemies of the Government, the blockade  would be raised ; though, in  order toprevent smuggling by the ill-disposed, the production  of a  permit from the politicalagent would be required before goods would be allowed  to leave India for Koweit.   TheGovernment hoped  that  the  Shaykh would  consult its representatives  in Koweit inregard to the measures  to be taken to prevent supplies being sent to enemy persons,and also in regard to the quantities of goods required for his own. territory.     Following the delivery of this message, there was a long  discussion which was notdevoid of plain speaking.   The Shaykh was rather frightened  of personal responsibility and of the chance  of tale-bearers being listened to,  but  he said that the word of theGovernment was his law and vowed friendship, the political agent having reassured him onthe points as to which he had expressed anxiety.  The Shaykh caused a notice decreeingconfiscation of property and banishment in the case of  anyone who should  act against us; and in a further interview on the following day be showed a desire  to  take  somereal action.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     The British Socialist Party and Mesopotamia. In  its issue of  the  13th  July the&quot; Hull and Lincolnshire Times &quot; published a letter from  a  son of Councillor Emerson, ofHull, who is serving as  a corporal with the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.   CorporalEmerson says :          I read some weeks ago  the Avar aims of  the  British Socialist Party, whoever     they may be.   They seemed, to be in for handing Mesopotamia back  to  the Turks,     lock, stock, and barrel making them a present of it, so to speak.  I am glad the     Labour Party will  not be influenced  by  such  trash.  Those  who run the B.S.P.     ought to spend a few months out here.  They would not then  talk such nonsense.     The Turks really didift care a fig for the country, except so far as it  brought them     in revenue.   Neither did they care a  button for the Arabs who inhabited it.     Without   a  word  of jest  there is, untold wealth  here.  All that is wanted is     intelligence, and, above all, the energy to work and make the best of the country.     The Arabs have never been offered any inducements to be industrious.   The Turks     have been lacking  in initiative and  energy, and as a result the place is hi  wrack     and ruin.   There are millions of acres here on which nothing  has been grown for     generations, and which would produce food in abundance with a minimum of effort.     If it is given over to  Turkey it  will   produce  nothing;  nobody  will  get  any     benefit.   I understand  that  already many thousands of  acres have  been put     under cultivation for the  purpose  of feeding  the  army, so a  start  has therefore     been made.                       -/S-            -           ^         Glaring examples of Turkish rule are to  be seen in  every town and village     the British forces have  entered.   There are no  ideas  of  sanitation,  education,     medical attention,  or any  of the  elementary  necessities  of  even a  semi-civilised     State.  The result is that children are  brought up  amid  filthy  conditions, no     attempt is made to educate them, and during mild  epidemics  they  die  like  flies.     It is life  simply wasted.   We have altered all this in the places which have been     brought under our control.  A good clean system of sanitation is established ; the     streets are swept,  rubbish is burned,  urinals are built, and dead horses, mules and     dogs are not left to rot in the streets like they Avere under Turkish  rule.  Schools     have been established and children are  taught  to read in  English and Arabic.
    Free  medicine and  medical  attention  are  given wherever necessary,  even to    hospital treatment.  A police force is  recruited from  the Arabs themselves,  and    the public are given some idea of decent civic behaviour.   No attempt  has ever    been  made  to interfere with religious or ancient customs.   The Arabs  are just    beginning to reap the benefits of our rule in  better health,  cleaner  surroundings,  .*^nd a more  interesting life.  I have said all  this  because  it seems such utter -  . Tdiocy on the part of the B.S.P. to talk of ever handing Mesopotamia back again to    the Turks.&apos;   If ever you are called upon to give your voice or vote upon the matter    you will know how to act.                                    PERSIA.    Abadeh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 13th July [No.  617] that a messengerwho had returned to Ispahan from Abadeh had reported  that  the enemy were com-manded by Soulefs brother and included 200 rifles.   The enemy  had attacked on  the5th July and had been repulsed  with sixty casualties.  The Rifles, he said,  were  nottrusted by the Kashgai, and were discontented as  they only received two  krans a day.British officers, though in different cpuarters, were in  daily touch with the Indian troops.    Shiraz. -Telegraphing on the 13th July [No. 618], Sir C.  Marling said that aletter had been received from the General Staff at Shiraz giving the conditions  existingon the 25th June.  The South Persian Rifles and  Indian troops then held the place,  andwere being helped by Kawam and his following.   They were in  a strong  position  and supplies were coming in;  but there was cholera in Shiraz, owing to the source of thewater being in the hands of the enemy, who suffered from  the disease.   The Kashgais,the writer said, wanted to emigrate ; they were tired of the fighting.    Three days later he  telegraphed [No. 629] a summary  of a report which, he  hadreceived from  Sir Percy Sykes.   In  this report,  which was dated the 3rd July, sir percy said that the governor-general had appointed Soulefs brother, Ehteshan Ukhaniand another brother, Ali Khan, Ilbegi of the Kashgais.  Soulet was being deserted byhis followers ; the Baharlus had  already gone, and now these two brothers had signedagreements against him.  All  was well at Shiraz,  and nearly  all the South  PersianRifles were standing  by us in that place.  He anticipated a speedy improvement in thesituation throughout the district.    The Shah and the Cabinet.-Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 16th July [No. 625]that the  Shah was asking his  consent to a Cabinet he was  trying to form  underAin-ed-Dowleh.   The Shah proposed to include Nosrat Dowleh and Vossugh-ed-Dowlehin this Cabinet, his obvious intention being to discredit the  latter of these two states-men.  Sir 0. Marling refused his concurrence.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                  PALESTINE.    General Clayton reports that a member of the. French  Mission, accompanied by french  officers,  attended Mass on  St.  Johifs  day  at  the church of St. John  atAin Karim.    Nearly  400  recruits for  Emir  Feysafs army have  been  obtained by the Arab&quot;recruiting Commission.    On the  3rd July a farewell  meeting was held at Jaffa  in honour  of  the  Jewishvolunteers proceeding to  Egypt.  Dr. Weizman presented two banners, and the ChiefRabbi gave a copy of the Scroll of Law to  a section  of the volunteers.  A large andenthusiastic recruiting meeting was held at Jerusalem on  the same  day.   350  Jewishrecruits left  for Egypt on the 4th July.    The first Bairam feast since the occupation  was held and passed off satisfactorily.The Mufti of Jerusalem  sent a loyal message  to His Majesty the  King on behalf ofthe Moslem  population, and messages were also sent to the Commander-in-chief and theKing of the Hedjaz.    On  the east of the Jordan the Arab  situation has been  quiet.  No Armenianrefugees have come in for the past three weeks.    All Germans have been evacuated from Jaffa except a few invalids and very old people, and  the majority  of those in  Jerusalem will be evacuated at  the end of July to^gyp1-        .                     .                      .    The inhabitants of Maan are anxious to come over to Emir Feysal, and 300  cameon the 7th July into his  camp.                                        o
