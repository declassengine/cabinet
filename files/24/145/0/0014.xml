APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT, No.  LXXIV.                                    RUSSIA.   THE Bolshevik power seems to continue to decline.   The successes of the Czecho-ilavs, the rumours of the assassination of the Ex-Emperor and the disappearance of theJrand-Duke Michael taken together may perhaps indicate the beginning of a revival  oflational spirit and feeling.                                  BULGARIA.   The  political changes in Bulgaria are to be noted, though no great  hopes can belased solely on these changes,  the  situation is none the worse for  them from our pointf view.                                   TURKEY.   The  general  tendency  in Turkey is evidently to commence a political offensive.mong the Arab-speaking peoples in favour of reconciliation.   This is dangerous.                                   PERSIA.   The  situation is incapable of appreciation.  The whole of the Persian section should)e read.                                                                        M. S.   June 27, 1918.[898-101

Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed from  Moscow  on the21st June [No. 298J  that  he had had a long conversation with MM. Chicherin andKarachan, who were once more quite friendly ;  they repeated their old assurances thatthey  would declare war on&apos; Germany when they were strong enough, and would acceptallied help if,  in the meanwhile, she should be attacked.   But they were of opinion thatGermany, after her experiences in Ukraina, would not lightly- embark in any adventurein Great Russia ;  they said too  that they had been assured  by Count Mirbach thatGermany did  not  intend to act against the Soviet.     The Black Sea Fleet.-Qn the 22nd June M. Chicherin sent the following wireless message to M. Joffe, the Russian Plenipotentiary in  Berlin :-     We  are  informed  that  some  of our  ships  have returned  from Novorossiisk toSebastopol, and that the others have been blown up by the crews.     Request for the Recall  of Entente  Warships. -The following  wireless message .was issued by the  Russian Government on the 18th June :      Chicherin, the People&apos;s Commissioner for Foreign  Affairs, has transmitted to Mr.Lockhart, the  British diplomatic representative,  and to the consuls-general of the UnitedStates and France at Moscow, three notes, identical  in terms, which request from these states the recalling of their warships from Russian ports.     The note to the British states that this measure was  delayed after the  conclusionof the  Brest-Litovsk treaty, owing to time being necessary, for the demobilisation of themilitary  bodies in Western Russia, but that  since then the Commissariat for ForeignAffairs has many times had occasion to draw the attention to those  concerned  that itwas impossible to  allow  even the British naval unit to remain in Russian ports.     In consequence of this  the Commissatdat protests against the presence  of  british units in  Russian  ports, and the Russian Republic will  take all measures against the
2landing of foreign detachments on the shores of Russia, if such  instances should arise,and also against the continued remaining of-belligerent warships in her northern ports. ^    In the notes to the  consuls of the United States and  France, the Commissariatremarks that it is impossible that warships of belligerent States should be permitted toremain in Russian ports, because at any moment they might leave these ports for hostileoperations.  The Commissioner believes that the United States, which on many occasionshave shown their kindly disposition towards the Councils Republic, will give  this notetheir consideration, and that France also will recall her warship  which is now cruisingin the  Arctic Ocean along the shores of Russia.    The Brest-Litovsk Treaty.-^Sh  H.   Rumbold telegraphed  on  the  19th June[No. 977] that Dr. Parodi had reported the confirmation of the rumoured secret clauses in the  Brest-Litovsk  treaty,  one of them  providing for  the partition  of Galicia.Dr Parodi&apos;s information  had  come from a very sure source.    Threatened Destruction  of Munitions at Archangel. Mr. Young telegraphed fromArchangel on the  19th  June [No. 82] that  he had received secret information from atrustworthy source  that M. Lenin had ordered that preparations  should be made for thedestruction of ammunition and explosives stored  at Archangel; which,  if done, wouldprobably bring  about the blocking of the  river below the town,  to say nothing of the damage to the town itself.    Re-ported Murder of the Ex-Emperor. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 21st June[No. 298] that MM. Chicherinand Karachan had informed him that to the best of their knowledge there was no truth  in the rumour that the  Ex-Emperor had been murderedat Ekaterinburg.    The Grand-Duke Michael. In his telegram of the  21st June [No. 298] Mr. Lockhartsaid that MM. Chicherin and Karachan had told him that the rumour of the escape ofthe Grand-Duke Michael was  true ; they supposed that he  had joined the counter-revolutionaries and the Czechs  in  Siberia.UKRAINA.    The Peace Conference at Kieff. M. Chicherin sent the following wireless message on the 21st June to M. Ioffe in Berlin :     On the 17th June the political  commissions  of the  delegation held a  session for discussing the  Ukrainan proposals  concerning the new frontiers.   The two  partiesexchanged  maps marked with the proposed frontier  lines.   The  difference being too great,  the  Russian delegation  proposed  the  solution  of the questions  involved by :a referendum of the people in the regions Concerned.  The Ukrainan delegation dissented,stating that parts of a State cannot  decide questions in  which the whole State isinterested as regards its future.    The discussions also dealt with the  frontiers on  the Don  and  on the Kuban, andthe future of the Crimea.  The Ukrainans claimed the Crimea.  Rakovsky,  presidentof the Russian delegation, stated that the annexation of the Crimea by Ukraina  wasnot supported by any ethnographical  or  other reason.  No international act proclaimsthe independence of the Crimea.   The declarations of  certain groups of the  Crimea andthe Kuban express only the opinion of some separate classes, and not the opinion of thewhole population.  The congress of the Kuban councils, with 500 delegates, representing90 per cent, of the  whole population,  decided that the Kuban region must form part ofthe Russian Councils&apos; Federal Republic.     No agreement was reached.     On the 18 th June, a meeting took place of commissions  for the exchange of goods.It was decided  to satisfy the  immediate needs  of both countries, first as regards  thenecessaries for existence, and  to  ascertain what  quantities  of  goods have  not arrived,so as to replace  them immediately by fresh freights.  The Russian  delegation asked forcorn and coal.   The Ukrainan  delegation asked for machine and other oils.SIBERIA.     The Czecho-Slovak Rising. Mr. Lindley, who has gone, to Russia to take charge ofall the British missions, telegraphed on the 21st June [No. 1] an account of the Czecho-Slovak rising, taken from a Bolshevik organ published in Murmansk.
      The rising was, he said, officially ascribed to the delay in  despatching the Czecho- Iplovak battalions  to. Entente countries.  The Czechs demanded an increased bread  ration and permission to leave by way of Vladivostock : the Soviet, on the other hand,  fdemanded an immediate surrender of their arms.   The rising began on the 26 th May,  land soon spread both to the  East and to  the  West, and  steady progress was made.  jOmsk was occupied-on  the 9th June, and on  the  same day Samara was  taken by two  jCzech regiments commanded by a French  officer.  A provisional Siberian Government  was established at Omsk and presented  a  programme  to the Soviet embracing the  Srestoration of local, self-government with a general democratic  franchise,  and  the  I summoning of a Siberian constituent assembly to settle the relations of Siberia and  Russia : the Government also offered to  supply  European Russia with  grain on the  condition that no Soviet troops should cross  the Urals.   The Soviet refused to enter on  any negotiations.      At the commencement of hostilities the representatives of Great Britain, France,  America, and Italy informed the  Soviet that  their Governments had a lively interest in  the Czechs, and were  much concerned at the course of  current  events:  the Soviet  replied by saying that, being a neutral Power,  Russia could not allow the movement of  foreign armed forces within its territory ;  this  in spite of the soviet&apos;s sympathy with  the Czechs, the bulk of whom were  recognised  as being  of revolutionary mould.  The  Soviet said that it was quite willing to allow the Czechs to leave Russia, but they must  go unarmed.   Germany had already demanded their disarmament, and had threatened  to take her own measures were this not  carried out.      In another telegram [No. 2] of the  same  date, Mr.  Lindley  noted that the Czech  movement was growing in importance ;  but he added that, though the outlook seemed  promising, it too much resembled other  movements to make  him very sanguine as to  its success.      On the same day  Mr.  Lockhart reported [No.  298] a  conversation he  had had  with MM. Chicherin and Karachan, in  the  course of which  the latter had  expressed  themselves perfectly confident as to the  crushing of the Czech movement.  They were, I he said, amused at the idea that they had accepted  German help for the purpose of  crushing it, such aid, they asserted, had not  even been offered by Count Mirbach.              I                                      SERBIA.      New  Cabinet Sir C. des Graz  telegraphed from Corfu on the 19th June [No.  74]  that he had been informed by the  Prime Minister (whose journey westward  had been  temporarily postponed) that the new Ministry  was complete.      Moving the seat  of Government from Corfu. In his telegram  of  the  19th June  Sir C. des Graz said that the transfer of the seat of Government from Corfu  had been  deferred.    Mention   had  been  made  of  Verria ; but he  understood  that they  were making inquiries as to the  possibility of accommodation at  Volo.                                     BULGARIA.INew  Cabinet.-A  Sofia tefegram  (22nd  June) states  that the  new  Bulgarian  Cabinet is   constituted  as  follows :   Premier  and  Minister  for  Foreign Affairs,  M. MalinofF;  Minister of the Interior, M. Takeff; Minister of Finance, M. Luiptekeff;  Minister  of  Education,  M.  Kostorikoff;  Minister  of Justice,  Professor  Donaloff;I Minister of Agriculture,  M. Madjaroff;  Minister of Public Works, M. Mouchanoff;  Minister of Railways,  Professor  Moloff;  Minister for War, General Raka.  Most of the  members of the Cabinet belong to the Democratic Party.   General Raka has been up to  the present eommander-in-chief of the fourth army. MM. Takeff, Luiptekeff, Mouchanoff,  and Moloff were members of the first Malinoff Cabinet,  which remained in power from  1908  up to 1911.                                      TURKEY.       Talaat. Sir  H.  Rumbold  telegraphed on  the  20th June  [No.  9.S4]  that  the  military attache had learnt that Talaat had  abandoned  his proposed  visit  to Berlin.  The Turkish Minister in Berne was to have  met him there, but he had  been  summoned  by Talaat to go to Constantinople  instead.  Turkey and  Bulgaria had  been informed  that  their presence was unnecessary at the Berlin  conference  for the  revision  of  the treaty  with Russia, as the questions  for  discussion only concerned the Central  Powers.         [898-101]                                                      B 2
    Stale of Feeling in Constantinople. An agent reports that a Turkish  diplomatistwho recently visited Constantinople had expressed himself  much as follows in regard tothe general feeling of the people.   The idea had been firmly fixed in their minds thatthe German offensive in France would have precisely the same  effect as it had had inRussia, that with  one blow of her fist Germany  would destroy everything, and that peace would follow immediately.  Things having fallen out  otherwise, there was generaldisappointment, accompanied by a feeling of annoyance.  Everyone  was waiting to &amp;eewhat would happen to Germany, knowing full well that the future  of  Turkey wasintimately bound up with that of the Central Powers; and people had been made moresceptical as to tlie final fesult by the English advance towards Mosul.     The Arab question  too was a disquieting one ; the situation in regard to Mecca andits ruler  should never  have  been created, for it had only served  to drive the  Arabfarther away.   The policy of Jernai Pasha, had done untold, mischief;  everywhere theEnglish had found a people ready to desert Turkey, and they had known how to profitby this.     There was, in short, a general feeling of depression in the city;  few believed in the stability of German  successes, and the people in bulk were utterly devoid of interest incurrent events and wearied to death of the war.     In military circles, however, the collapse of  Russia  had  opened  up  unhoped-forvistas ; it was felt that the acquisition  of vast  new provinces,  by the release of theRussian Moslems, was practically certain; plans were being made for a greater Turkey,freed from all foreign yoke, and in addition it was believed that the influence of the new-Turkey would steadily increase in  Persia.     Finally, he said, the party of reaction was also at work, and the partisans of YussufIzeddin were plotting against the State.     A  Message from Talaat to the Armenian  Patriarch. Another agent reports thathe had been informed  by a  Turkish  deputy  that a  message from Talaat  Pasha was recently sent to the Armenian Patriarch informing him that the Turkish  Governmentwould not  only allow the thousands of Armenians deported to Asia Minor, and  theredying from the effects of  exposure  and hunger, to return to their own country, but,more, would provide them with money to enable them to start life again, if on his part the patriarch would make a written declaration, addressed to the Turkish Government,that the treason of the Armenian people and their general attitude towards the Govern-ment were, in fact, the causes which brought about the deportations and the massacres.\Cf. E.R. LXXI1&quot;, p. 2,  &quot; The Wolf and the Lamb &quot;].                                  PALESTINE.     Miscellaneous Notes. General Clayton  telegraphed on the 22nd June (1) &quot;Thatthe Zionist Commission had taken over the  Hillsverein  schools, which were now allworking under  a  Zionist curriculum; (2) that for the entertainment of Arab  visitorsfrom  the east  of Jordan, an  Arab hostel had been established  at Jerusalem, under the auspices of the Arab Bureau ; and (3) that great  satisfaction had been  afforded toMoslems by the arrangements for the official announcement of Ramadan and the firingof a salute.                                     PERSIA.     The  New  Cabinet  and its Policy. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  20th June[No.  568] that  samsam--es-Sultaneh had succeeded in forming a Cabinet.   MusharesSultaneh  was Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sirdar Mohtasham for War, Murritazul Mulkfor Public Instruction, and Hakimul Mulk for Finance.   Mdinuz Vezareh and MumtazedDowleh were also included.     Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 569] he said that the sending of a stronglyworded telegram to Soulet had been promised by Satnsam-es-Sultaneh, whose attitude ingeneral,  however,  was unsatisfactory.  He talked about forcible suppression  of theopposition, and admitted that he  had. threatened to arrest  Firuz Mirza oh  a charge ofintrigue;  Sir C. Marling did not think that he would venture to do this, lie had himselfwarned him as to the folly of such a proceeding, and had hinted that if the threat were carried out he should protest against it to the Shah.   The  fact of Sirdar Mohtashambeing Minister  for War made it  probable that questions would  be raised in regard tothe Cossacks.
     Vossugh-ed-Dowleh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 24th June [No.  580] thatduring the last week Vossugh&apos;s supporters had  been  holding night demonstrations inthe chief mosque and the bazaar.  The demonstrations had been led  by many of theleading moderate politicians and by the chief ulemas.   There was every prospect ofsuccess.    Fars.-On  the  19th June  Sir C. Marling  transmitted [No. 566]  a  telegram received from the consul at Shiraz on the previous day informing him  that  the Jewshad been forced to stop working for us ;  that there had been looting of houses  belongingto persons connected wdth us;  and that the houses of Soper&apos;s Persian officers had been broken open and their persons molested.    Soper had with difficulty been prevented from attacking the town, which, however,at the suggestion of the governor-general, he had occupied during the night.  An attack was now  improbable,  as  the  whole town was  controlled  by the governor-generafsposition in the Ark, Kawam&apos;s in his own quarter, and  Soper.    Arrangements were being made for the disarming of persons entering the  town andfor the arrest of the most  prominent of those  who were working against us ; but atpresent neither the  democratic nor the religious leaders were being interfered with.    On the 23rd June Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No.  578] that there  had been nomeans of communicating with Shiraz since the 18 th, on which day the line was cut southof Abadeh.    Farman  Farma.  [E.R.  LXVII,  p.  6].-On  the  16th June  Sir C.  Marlingtelegraphed [No.  549] that he  had  been informed by the  consul  at  Shiraz thatFarman Farma  had  requested  in  writing  that, having  regard to  the  losses  hehad sustained during the  last  three years on account  of the  non-collection ofrevenue derived from  the estates  belonging  to him  and his  five  elder sons,  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  should  compensate him  at  the  rate of  4O,00OZ. a year,guaranteeing that income for so long as the present troubles should continue;  andthat in the event of bis  losing his estates and  having to flee the country he shouldbe granted property in British territory which should  provide an equal income for thejoint  lives of himself and his sons.     Sir 0. Marling agreed with the  consul at Shiraz that  something  should be done.He however suggested that Farman  Farma should have 3,000 tomans  a month so longas he remained governor  of Fars, and  that an equal  amount should be paid monthlyto  his  family in Teheran of which Firuz  should receive .a  third.   In addition he recommonded  that Farman Farma  should be given a sum of 15,000/i.   In the event ofexile  he suggested that Farman Farma  should be given  30,000L a  year and Firuz10,000Z.     Farman Farma&apos;s services were of great  importance to us at present, and we couldnot expect him, without a substantial guarantee, to risk his whole  position.   He had,therefore, felt bound  to  make these proposals, though he  realised  that they were more extensive than those which the Treasury  had already deemed excessive.  [E.R.XVIII, p.  5.]     Telegraphing again on the 18th [No.  562] he heard that the  consul at Shiraz had telegraphed that  Farman Farma thought  that his,  Sir C. Marling&apos;s, proposals were inadequate ; the  consul did not consider that this was a time for  haggling over money,and thought that Farmans proposals should be  accepted  without discussion.  FarmanFarina was already being cursed from the pulpit.                *     In reply to  these telegrams Mr. Balfour informed Sir C.  Marling on the 23rd June[No.  336] that his  suggestions and  those of the  consul  had been considered by  theEastern Committee.   In regard to the alleged loss of revenue, the  Committee was unable to arrive at a decision without further data.  As Sir C. Marling was of opinionthat  1 laving Farman Farma on our side was of material advantage to us. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was prepared to  make  him  an allowance during the continuance of thewar for so long as he, being friendly to us, should remain  Governor-General of Fars ;such allowance, for himself and his family, to be at the  rate of 6,000 tomans a month.The payment  of an adequate allowance would be considered if he should be driven intoexile, or if his estates should be confiscated because of his friendly relations with us.     Kawam Mulk.-On the 18th June Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 563] a message from the consul at  Shiraz conveying a request (which he,  the consul, considered reason-able) from Kawam Mulk that the pecuniary losses he had sustained, on account of hisRaving openly declared  for us, should be made  good, by His Majesty&apos;s Government, to
him or, in the event of his death, to his  heirs;  and  further that he should  he com?-pensated for losses arising from enforced exde.                                    -    Mr.  Balfour telegraphed in reply on  the 22nd June [No. 335] that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  could not commit itself to these  payments without further information.He instructed Sir C. Marling to  inform the consul that  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be prepared to make  Kawam Mulk an adequate aUowance if he should be exiledon account of his friendly relations with us; or, in the event of his death for the same ,reason, a similar allowance to his family.   His Majesty&apos;s Government was also prepared&apos;to consider such money losses  as he could prove to have incurred on account of havingdeclared  for us.    ,
