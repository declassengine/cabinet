The  War Office  issued the  following  communique  on the21st August:      A  wire from Murmansk, dated the 20th  August,  reports that  the enemy were attacked by our troops 7 miles south of Kapasolga after an artillery bombardment.The enemy were driven from their  positions and  pursued  south  for several  miles,prisoners being captured and losses inflicted.     Our Russian troops on the Shunga peninsula dispersed the enemy and captured 59prisoners, with three machine-guns.     Our Russian troops, after a sharp fight, captured a village about 20 miles south ofour former position on the Shunga peninsula, 32 of the enemy dead being counted.     On the east of Lake Onega two enemy  forces attempted to attack a village in ourpossession, but lost direction and attacked each other, suffering severe losses.     Odessa. On the  25th August&apos; Admiral  Webb reported [No.  1716] that he hadbeen informed by the  rear-admiral  in command  in  the Black Sea  that the volunteertroops had occupied Odessa.    General Denikin.26 th August : -The following communique was issued by the War Office on the     On General Denikin&apos;s western front the advance is continuing with great rapidityall along the line.   It is now confirmed that Odessa was  captured by a detachment of volunteers, who, after two days&apos; bombardment from the Black Sea, landed  and drovethe Bolsheviks, out of the town ; the latter were forced to retreat  in a  north-westerlydirection towards  Balta.     Along both banks of the Dnieper the volunteer advance towards; Kieff is makingrapid progress.  The Bolsheviks now admit having been forced  to retire to Borispol,just over 20, miles south-east of that city, which they  are  evacuating with great haste.Denikin&apos;s armoured trains, reconnoitring far ahead of his cavalry, are meeting with no opposition. and: can find no trace of enemy organization for defence.     At the. same time, the  advanced troops  of Petlura, the  Ukrainan  general, have captured Fastoff, just over 40 miles south-west of Kieff, the fate of which now appearsto be sealed.  Reliable reports state that the Bolsheviks in the whole of Ukraina are       [708]                                                               B
 completely demoralized, and it is also stated  that the peasantry of Ukraina  have now lost interest in their national independence, and are awaiting with eagerness the arrival of the voluntary army  so  that order may be restored, together with  such settled conditions as may  allow of a  resumption of internal and external  trade,  on which depends the prosperity of South Russia.     Admiral  Kolchak. Telegraphing on the  .25th  August  Mr.  Ramsay  reported [No. 1292]  the  receipt  in  Stockholm of  a  message  from Berlin to  the effect  that information had  been received from  Tokio,  via The  Hague, that  Admiral  Kolchak&apos;s government had been overthrown.     Bolshevik Barbarities. The  following  statement has been  issued  by  the  War Office :-     It has been  learnt from a very reliable source that the Bolsheviks have completely devastated and ransacked the stanitzas of the  Upper Don district, which, it must be remembered, rebelled against the Soviet power.   Most of the farms were burnt, and in consequence the  population has nowhere to live.   Live and dead stock, as well as corn, having been taken by the Reds, no farming is possible.     The population has undergone unspeakable cruelties :  children were killed  in  their cradles, old people were burnt together with straw, and  many  people have  been shot and executed :  5,000 men have  been executed in two of the stanitzas, the Migulinskaya and the Kazanskaya.   In addition,  373 men were  shot in the Sestranovsky village, 370 men in the Olkhovsky viilage, and 197 men in the Nijnimrachinsky village.  .     Strength of  the Bolshevik Forces. The following appeared in the &quot; Morning Post &quot; of the 22nd August :             .      .     We are able to print to-day, on excellent authority, the following information about the strength and distribution of the Bolshevik  armies.   In  all these number fifteen,disposed over four  fronts, as shown below, comprising 485,000 men.   In addition to these, 727,000 men, it is estimated, are in the interior, on service or under training.  It is not probable that these reserves are all effectives,  but they can be usefully employed in putting down  risings and like duty :      North Russian (Archangel and Murmansk) front:            6th army (34,000 men) and the Olonetz group  (5,000) in Karelia.

     The Government of North-West  Russia.  [E.R. CXXXIV, p.  1.]-On  the  21stAugust Lord  Ourzon informed  [No.  13] Colonel Tallents  at  Reval that his majesty&apos;sgovernment could not assent to the proposals which had been made.     The Food Situation in North-West Russia. On  the  20th  August  the  deputycommissioner  at  Reval telegraphed [No. D. C.  43l as follows :      The food situation of the people and  army of  North-West Russia has  becomeserious  owing to the  abrupt termination of all American food supplies.   The  foodactually in sight is sufficient only for  a  very limited period, during the greater part ofwhich flour alone will be excessive.  Over and above this,  there is  the Viborg dep6thitherto ear-marked (? for)  distribution amongst the population of  Petrograd after itsrecapture; if this be consumed now it must be reconstituted  before  the recapture  of petrogard, as the political result of  failure to distribute food after that event wouldnullify  any military success.   I understand that  there  are  15,000  tons  of flour  in sweden.  If immediate action were taken this might be transported to the liberated areas in time to save the dispersal of the  Yiborg stock.  Such  action  depends on aguarantee being forthcoming to restore equivalent flour  to Sweden within  six months.The American food mission  here has  been disbanded, and  I am informed no  further supplies of food, either for children, the civilian population, or the army are likely to  be forthcoming, as the money voted for the purpose by congress has been expended and  nofurther appropriation made.   May I  venture to urge, as  North-West Russia is nowunder the control of a democratic government in  which men of all  parties are  united,that it is  desirable  that greater assistance should  be rendered than was consideredappropriate when the territory in question was controlled by a purely military administra-tion of uncertain, or even suspect, political complexion.     Having discussed the situation with General Gough, I  recommend  therefore thathis majesty&apos;s government should agree to feed  the Russian  army and supply food forthe civilian population, against  repayment, for  a  period of six months, and that  an allowance of 2,000,000Z. sterling should  be  paid  monthly for a similar period into the account of the North-West  Russian government at the Bank of England.  This wouldbe (group undecypherable) at a suitable  interest, and would be retained by the bank  asa guarantee against the issue  of  North-West Russia roubles; thus these roubles would immediately acquire a reasonable local exchange and become acceptable to  the russian troops and officials and available for payments in Esthonia and Einland.   Without  suchample and immediate  assistance  I fear that the North-West Bussian government maydespair and accept  the German government proposals of  assistance as the sole meansof preservation of the North-West Russian army.                                     POLAND.     The proposed  British  Mission.   [E.R. CXXXIII,  p.  4.]-On  the 19th  AugustSir Percy Wyndham reported [No. 185] that Mr. Paderewski had opposed  the proposalto despatch a mission in the strongest possible manner.   He urged that Mr. Morgen-thau&apos;s  mission had already  excited  popular feeling ; and if another mission shouldprovoke an outbreak the government  would be in danger.     Two days previously,  Sir Percy said, he had been asked  to  request his majesty&apos;sgovernment to  ask the Polish  government to  accept the mission as a special act ofcourtesy.   This had been  done  by the  vice-minister of foreign  affairs, who, however,would not then give a definite answer as to the acceptance  of the mission:  the requiredassurances had indeed only been given  by the vice-minister that  morning (the  19th)and then with the greatest reluctance on his part.     With reference to this telegram, on the  22nd  August Lord  Curzon  telegraphed[No. 230]  to Sir Percy Wyndham the  following  summary of a conversation betweenthe Polish minister and the under-secretary of state :      The minister referred to the impending despatch of a British mission, and said thathe feared that it would be resented by the Polish press and the public.  Too many suchmissions had been  travelling all over  Poland to collect similar information :  hence a feeling of  irritation and resentment  throughout the country.   The proposed missionseemed to be an  unnecessary interference in Polish internal affairs:  the  Poles beingquite capable of governing themselves.   The under-secretary replied that bis majesty&apos;sgoverment was despatching this mission on account of the wide-spread feeling in thiscountry, especially in  parliament, about  the treatment of Jews in Poland.  It would beimpossible for us to give assistance, financial or economic,, until the hostile feeling aroused       [708]                                                             B 2
by  the accounts of the treatment  of Jews had been  allayed.  The appointment ofSir Stuart Samuel, M.P., as head of the mission was  a guarantee of its  broad-mindedand unbiassed spirit.   If, as we hoped, enquiries resulted in proving the exaggerationof outrages and in exonerating the Polish people  the result  would  be  excellent.    On ..account of the promise to the house of commons, if the mission were now abandoned the Jworst suspicions would be aroused both in and outside parliament.     Poland and Lithuania. The following statement  by  Prince Sapieha,  the newlyappointed Polish  minister  in  London, appeared  in the  &quot; Sunday  Times&quot;  of  the24th August      Our eastern frontier question is an interesting one because of the historic precedent for extending our boundary as far as the rivers Dziwina and Dnieper,  or  even furtherat one point.     Historically, the population of our eastern frontier districts was  an agglomeration ofdifferent nationalities living in  provinces joined to  Poland  by the act of  union withLithuania.     Lithuanians and  Poles were early drawn together, a grand  duke  of Lithuaniabecoming king of Poland.   During the 14th, 15th, and 16th  centuries the two countries were thus held by a personal union.   The Lithuanians were given abundant opportunityto absorb Polish ideals of civilization, while legislation was in practice much the same inthe two spheres.  Later the union became material as opposed to personal.     Although nominally, at any rate, there were  two governments, Lithuania and poland formed what was to all intents and purposes one whole, much like England andWales.  The eastern districts were inhabited to the north by Lithuanians, in the centreby Lithuanian Poles and Ruthenians, and to the east by White Ruthenians.   All  theupper classes in  these districts became Polish ;  the  literary language was Polish; eventhe language of government became Polish, although it should  have remained WhiteRuthenian.   The religion of the Lithuanians  and the  Polish colonists was Catholic,Orthodox, or Greek Catholic.     After the Russian  domination, which  began in  its final shape at  the close of the18th  century, the  users  of the Polish language  were remorsely  persecuted by  theMuscovites,  while Greek Catholics were compelled to enter the Orthodox Church.     Every manifestation of Polish national feeling was  suppressed  under the Russianregime, and Polish schools were forbidden.  Simultaneously, great landed properties wereconfiscated taken from the Poles and given to Russian officials, as well as  to military commanders who took part  in  crushing the Polish  nationalist risings.   Our churcheshad to become Orthodox, and our monasteries were  Russified supplying  centres fromwhich the Russian propaganda could be  carried  on.  Large numbers of Muscoviteofficials were imported into  the country and settled there, with the result that a Russianveneer was forced upon the  inhabitants of our eastern districts.     The Polish  diet of to-day has declared that Poland has no ambition to force Polishcitizenship upon anyone.  If our armies are now in the east, it is because its local population has claimed our help against the  Bolsheviks, after  soliciting in vain  the intervention of the civilised world.     The will of the people must decide all national or race questions.   Those who aim at being of Polish nationality can gratify their wish by means of a plebiscite. A plebiscitemust settle whether Lithuania  is to be independent  or a part and parcel  of  Poland.Such towns  as Vilna and Minsk, wherein the  majority of the  people are Polish, must decide their  own fate.     I  endeavour to examine all questions  relating to  the  eastern  districts as far aspossible with the eyes of the diet.   The Poles are at  present liberating  a country whichformerly belonged to Poland ; it is our definite intention that its inhabitants shall havea fair chance to determine their own nationality.   We do not  mean to subjugate  anyrace of people ; we  mean, however, that those inhabitants who do wish  to join us shallhave the right of choice as well as those others who hold a contrary  view.     The townspeople should have a decisive voice in  dealing with the fate of the towns.The citizens of Vilna should be able to speak authoritatively for Vilna.   The destiny-ofsuch places should not depend upon the whims of the peasants  of the countryside.     In Austria the Red Ruthenians were worked upon by  government  propagandistsuntil a very  strong separatist sentiment grew up.  Peasants  in  some  quarters  areexceedingly  susceptible to propagandist influences, whereas in  others they are equallyindifferent.     In Russian  Ukraina there is a separatist tendency among the peasants;  there is noimperialistic sentiment anywhere.                                  . ;
    In conclusion, it may be said that there is no doubt whatever that the new polish army is, per se, strong enough to hold the Bolsheviks.   It must  be  kept well supplied with all the things which go to make a first-class fighting force efficient in the field.                                    TUBKEY.    Inquiry into the Smyrna Incidents. On 11th August the  high  commissionerreported [No.  161]  that the  members  of the mission of inquiry  into  the  events atSmyrna had been nominated, and were as follows :          Italian       ...     ...    ...   General DalTOlio.         American    ...     ...    ...   Bear-Admiral Bristol.         French       ...     ...    ...   General Bounoust.         Great Britain...     ...    ...    Brigadier-General Hare.    General DalfOlio was the senior member.   A Greek  colonel was to be appointed as consultative member&apos;.    On 19th August Admiral  Webb reported [No. 1679] that the  grand  vizier had asked that an Ottoman colonel  might be admitted  as a consultative member  on thesame  footing  as  the Greek.   Telegraphing   again  three days later  [No.  1699 I  he reported  that  General   DalfOlio  had  received authority from Rome to  include  a turkish member on the same footing as the Greek member, had acted on that authority,and had informed the Turkish government that he had done so.    Warning from Mr.  Wilson. On 22nd August Admiral Webb  reported  [No. 1704]that a  note to the following effect bad  been presented by the American  high com-missioner  to the  Sublime  Porte.  Mr.  Wilson  desired  that the  Turkish  authoritiesshould be informed that  all rulings  in regard  to a secure  sovereignty over the Turkishportions of the present Ottoman empire under article 12 of tbe  peace terms [? No. 12of Mr. Wilson&apos;s points] would be withdrawn if immediate and effectual  measures&apos; werenot taken to prevent the massacre of Armenians and other atrocities by Moslems, andthat it  should be  pointed out that  such a  withdrawal must  result not only in theconditions of peace being altered, but also in  the complete dissolution  of the turkish empire.   No protest of inability to  prevent  such atrocities  would  be  accepted; theTurkish   government  must prove, that  it  is  both  willing  and  able  to  control  itsco-religionists if it  expects to exercise sovereignty over any portions of the empire.     Admiral Webb added  that this  note had greatly alarmed the  grand vizier, whoprotested  that everything possible  was being  done by  his  government  to preventdisorder;, nothing better calculated than this  note could  be  devised, he said, to  inciteChristians to provoke trouble.   The grand vizier also insisted on  the  necessity of hissending an expedition to reassure the Christian population and  to effect certain arrests.How could he  be held responsible,  he asked,  if he might not move troops  to  a pointof danger ?                                    ARABIA.     The Bed Sea Blockade-Telegraphing on 24th  August [No.  1296]  Field-MarshalAllenby called attention to the  fact  that the blockade of Asir and Yemen had been abolished by the Admiralty instructions,  but  that nothing had  been done in regard  tothe blockade of  Hejaz.   Permission  to reopen the dhow traffic from  bis&apos; ports, as  inpre-war times  had  been  applied for by King Hussein.     In  reply  to  this  Lord  Curzon  telegraphed  to Field-Marshal Allenby  on the25th August  [No.  973]  informing  him that  the  Admiralty was being asked  to sendinstructions for the immediate raising of the Hejaz blockade.                                     PERSIA.     Reception of the New Agreement. On  the  22nd August Sir Percy Cox reported[Nos.  569 and 572] that the  bulk  of the people  of Teheran had received the new agreement favourably, though there  had been signs of disapproval in varying degreesfrom the  officers of the  Cossack division, both Persian and Russian;  from the  ImamJuma Knoi and certain mudarris, all extremists;  from the  French,  American, and Russian legations, as far as  they  could safely go ;  from the  political enemies of theYossugh-ed-Dowleh ; and from certain  other out-of-work politicians.
     In the provinces, too, the bulk of the  population had received  it well.  In NorthArabistan, for instance, the agreement was  most favourably received ; in Shiraz, thoughfull details had not been received, the reception was generally favourable;  in Kborassanthe terms had been read&apos;at a large public meeting and generally appreciated.  In Tabriz,on the other hand, the population  was divided, the  extreme democrats&apos;suggesting thatit was intended to  make Persia  a second Egypt; and at Kazvin, where the peoplegenerally were apathetic, certain officials and local politicians had suggested that theend of independent Persia had come.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     Bolshevik Activities. On the 19th August Sir Percy Cox telegraphed [No. 561]that it had been reported that  Bravins  had made proposals for  the  entry of theBolshevik troops into Afghanistan, and that the governor of Herat had replied thathe  was willing to shelter them as refugees but that he did not require their assistance.When the  Bolshevik mission  left Herat for Kabul  the feeling  against it was so strong that  the band had refused to play.  When Bravins was at Herat he had invited the  Afghans to reoccupy  the  Pandjeh district and  Kushk, which was  seized by the.Russians thirty-four  years ago.o
