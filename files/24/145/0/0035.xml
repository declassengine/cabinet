SECRET.150APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  XCV.     ATTENTION is called to the telegrams from General Clayton and from the  chiefpolitical  officer  at  Baghdad with regard to the  reception given by different  sectionsof the  public - in  different places  to the joint  Anglo-French  declaration.   whereas the  declaration has  met  with enthusiastic response in  Damascus and those placeswere King  Hussein is  recognised,  the  reception accorded  to it  in  Palestine and mesopotamia is mixed, to say the least.  It is clear that, in  regard  both to palestine and  Mesopotamia, the important Jewish and Christian minorities regard the declarationwith  apprehension, and  as  far as they are concerned wish to see the maintenance ofBritish rule after the war in both these countries.     The French Government is still determined to hold us strictly to the agreements of1916, known to the public as &quot;the secret treaties.&quot;  These  agreements conflict withthe principle of self-determination and with the spirit of the new  joint declaration.  Theagreements  recognise  exclusive   French  rights  in  regard  to  Mosul  and  northernMesopotamia, and limits  the right of the Arabs in Syria  to choose their own advisers,stipulating that any such advisers must be French.  In view of  the  fact that the basisof the agreement has now  gone owing to the  disappearance of  Russian claims, and ofthe fact that public opinion throughout the world has fastened on these  secret  treatiesas a blot  upon the  allied  escutcheon, the attitude of  the  French Government isembarrassing.    If  the   terms of  the agreement are  to be  carried out as part ofthe  pe ice  settlement,  they may involve a  series  of  punitive  expeditions  againstthe inhabitants  of  countries which  repudiate French  tutelage.   It may  be possible,however, that the influence of Prince Feisal and the American Government rna)^ succeed in persuading the French Government to modify its intentions at the peace conference,and that public opinion in this country will insist on the safeguarding  of British interestsin a  part of the  world which has been liberated by British arms, and in  which  france has played  so insignificant a part during the war.  Unless we  can secure some modifi-cation of French claims, our prestige in the East will suffer a  blow from which  it willbe difficult  to  recover, and we, not the  French,  will be  blamed by our  Arab  alliesand the other populations of&apos;the,. Middle East, who look  to  us  to ensure  their futurefreedom.     The revelations in the public press regarding the abominable treatment of  british prisoners by the Turks are having a healtuy effect in  diminishing the influence of thelovers of the  &quot;clean  fighting&quot; Turk, and Lord Robert Cecils  speech in the House ofCommons on the Armenian question, which has been telegraphed  to Constantinople, isa  welcome  assurance that  the rule of the Ottoman is not to  be restored in countries such as  Armenia and cilicia.     The whereabouts of  the CUP. leaders is  still unknown.   They are  presumablygetting into touch with their natural allies, the Bolsheviks.   In this  connection  Lord.Kilmarnock reports that the anti-Zionist rabbi, Nahum, who is prominently connectedwith the C. U.P., has reached The Hague en route for America  in order  to propagatefor the restoration of Turkish  suzerainty in Palestine and Syria.

On the 16th November Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 168]to Sir  Charles Eliot informing him  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  was about  toinform  its  allies that  it  proposed to  recognize  the  Omsk  Government  as the  defacto ruling authority in such  parts of  Russia and Siberia as admitted  its authority.His Majesty&apos;s Government was  however of opinion that  such a recognition entitled itto insist on the new. Government dealing firmly with separatist tendenciesand generallykeeping its house in order : recognition  could only be granted on the hypothesis thatthe Omsk Government had both the will  and the power to preserve the union  of  itscomponent parts.     Mr.  Balfour having asked Sir Charles Eliot  to consult General Knox,  and  theninform  him as to whether, in their opinion, any conditions should be attached to the recognition, the high commissioner  telegraphed on the 19th NovemDer  [No. 250] that,in view of  a  communication which had been received from General Ivanoff, a  detailedreply seemed not to be needed.  He  and  General Knox had,  however,  drafted an opinion to the effect that unless  any conditions which might be proposed  concerned
some privilege which could be withdrawn should the Government prove to be incom-petent they would be useless.   They suggested representation at the  peace conference as  being  such a privilege  which might be made dependent on  the prevention of dis-ruption and disobedience.     Appointment of  a Dictator. The communication from General Ivauoff referred  toabove had been reported by the high commissioner on the 19th November [No. 247],and was to the effect that two decrees had been promulgated : one that the council ofministers  had  determined to assume the supreme  power on account  of extraordinaryevents having interrupted the  activity of the All-Russian Government, the other that admiral Kolchak had been appointed regent in view of the necessity  of concentratingthe supreme power in the hands of one man.   In another  document  Admiral  Kolchakannounced his assumption of the title of regent, with the supreme command of all.the Russian forces on land and sea.   Sir Charles Eliot noted that the word translated&quot;regent&quot; IB  usually translated &quot;dictator&quot;;  but  he  understood that the latter was thought  too  autocratic,  so that  it  would be translated  into French  by  &quot;regentsupreme.&quot;     Simultaneously  with Admiral Kolchaks  announcement another  was made  byGeneral Ivanoff, the commander-in-chief of the Siberian army, requiring all his officers to tender  their allegiance to the regent,  and threatening any who should rebel, disobey,or conduct any sort of propaganda against him, Admiral  Kolchak, with  the  severestpenalties.     The  High  Commissioner. Telegraphing  on the   19th   November [No.  251]Sir Charles Eliot said  that the change in the situation at Omsk made  it desirablethat he should go to that place which he proposed to  do in a few days&apos; time.  He hadalready proposed this in a telegram [No. 245] sent on the previous day, in which he recalled that the French high commissioner and the United States consul-general were already there.       ,NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Proclamation by M. Chaihowshi. Mr. Lindiey telegraphed on the 13th November[No. 405] the  text of a proclamation by  M. Chaikowski as  follows :      To the population of the Northern region  and the Russian allies.     The world war is at an end.   All civilized humanity breathes a sigh of relief.   the crisis of our sickness is past, and we are now freed from an immediate mortal threat tocivilisation and liberty, but the  danger of incidental complications, due to the war,remains.     One such complication, Bolshevism,  must be liquidated before humanity can devoteitself to the constructive work of peace.   It is  a mistake to suppose that the conclusionof peace between the allies and the central Powers puts an  end to danger of Bolshevism.     Unfortunately, Bolshevism is a danger not merely to Russia but internationally.This danger consists in the seizure of power by a negligible minority, relying on the armed support of a rebel army and navy, in order to force the majority to submit to the will of the leaders of  a single party, unrecognised by the population and not elected bythem for the government of the country.     Such usurpation of authority is only possible in the atmosphere  of war; with the cessation  of war it should immediately be liquidated, no matter what high-soundingwatchwords it may adopt to justify such violation of the rights of the free people.     In Russia it has taken  the form of a return  to  the  principle of government  byintensive  and  extraordinary  police methods, similar to those employed by the imperialgovernment during a period- of martial law  lasting  from 1889  to 1917- with  shortintervals  in  1905  and  1906  at the  time  of first Russian revolution.   The soviet authorities returned  to this policy after the October rebellion  of 1917.  Since thattime  they have committed more crimes and  acts  of   violence than  the  imperialgovernment during the whole twenty-seven years of its unnatural dictatorship.   Now,this siren, tempting to its embraces the credulous, the weak-minded, and the unprincipled,is trying to persuade the world  it represents a longed-for socialist heaven &quot; proletariatdictatorship.&quot;   It is time to put an end  to this mystification.   All peoples  must strainevery nerve for the sake of liberty, justice, and happiness of the proletariat of the world,otherwise it will be the grave not only for their own liberty and prosperity, but those of-all  humanity.
        In any case there can be no place for Bolshevik usurpers at the international peace    congress, for peaceful relations between nations incompatible with the policy of violence    on which the Bolshevik power is  based.  Such policy not only must lead to civil war,    but  inevitably leads to war  with neighbouring  nations  and  destroys  the  state of    peace.        This is why  there can be no true end  to  the war without a final liquidation of    Bolsh evism j that  is why no one having at heart the cause of peace can lay down his    arms before Soviet power has  been broken.    SIBERIA.        Attitude of  the French. In a  telegram dated the 18th  November [No. 242] Sir    Charles Eliot  called attention to the fact that  it was sufficiently  obvious  from the    general  behaviour of the  French in  Siberia  that they were claiming the position of    Russia&apos;s senior and most  distinguished ally.    This was  illustrated  by the  position    claimed by General Japin, by the support given to the Omsk Government by the French    high commissioner, and by  his promises of financial assistance.   The high commissioner    had  also suggested to Sir Charles Eliot that in the matter of railway administration a    greater part might be played by France.                                        POLAND.        Eastern  Galicia. Sir  Horace  Rumbold telegraphed  on  the   13th  November    [No. 2183]  saying  that Polish troops had left Cracow for eastern  Galicia,  and that    Przemysl had. been occupied by Poles.        On the 14th November (before  the receijot  of Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram)    Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Lord Derby, Mr. Barclay, and Sir  Rennell Rodd instructing    each to inform the  Government to  which he was accredited that a representative in    London of the  Polish national committee had been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    ment would view  with  serious displeasure any military or  other action of the Polish    Government in eastern Galicia, or elsewhere, of a nature  to  prejudge or forestall thei    decisions of the peace conference.        Claim of the National Committee to be recognised as a  de facto Government. !    Lord Derby reported [No.  1534] on the 19th  November that the  Polish  nationali    committee had informed Captain  Leveson-Gower that it  had approached the  FrenchI    Government with  a  view to being  recognised as a  de facto Government in  the domainI    of foreign policy, political  control of the Polish  army, and  the protection of Poles    living abroad.   The committee stated that it  understood that  the French Government\    had suggested to  the Governments of the allies  and of the United  States that theyI    should  answer this request  in  a favourable sense,  and recognise  the right of the    committee to be represented at inter-allied conferences.        General Pilsudshi to form a  new Government. Reuter reports that according to  a    telegram from Warsaw the Polish regency council has announced that all troops shall    be placed under  General Pilsudski&apos;s   command ;  and that General Pilsudski has been    entrusted  with the formation of a  national  government; when he has accomplished    this task the regency council will  hand over its authority to it.        Messages to Marshal Foch and President  Wilson. General Pilsudski has  sent the    following message to Marshal Foch,  transmitted through the  wireless stations of the    German Government, and  one in similar terms for transmission to President Wilson by    Marshal Foch:         In  my capacity as  commander-in-chief of  the  Polish  army I   beg the French    Government and  your  Excellency to be  kind enough  to  take the necessary steps in    order that the Polish troops forming  part of the French army may be sent to Poland as    soon as possible and incorporated into the army which  to-day is  united under my    command.   The Polish nation, which for  a long time has suffered the occupation  of its    country by foreign troops, is at  present preparing  with  the greatest enthusiasm to    receive on their native soil the sons of the fatherland  who are dispersed all  over the    world.   The Polish  nation would look upon a favourable reply on the part of the French    Government as upon a fresh proof of generosity and a precious sign  of good-will of    -France towards the Polish cause.
                                   RUMANIA.    Proclamation by the King. On the 14th November Lord Derby transmitted a jointmessage (dated 8th  November) from the allied ministers  at Jassy, reporting that theKing  of Rumania had issued a proclamation announcing that agrarian reform anduniversal suffrage would be carried out immediately.                                    SERBIA.    The Jugo-Slav State. Lord Derby reported on the 17th November [No.  1514] thathe had just received  the following communication from Sir Arthur Evans :             ()    The difficulties in  the way of a working union  between Serbia and the  Jugo-Slavstate (Slovenes, Croats. Dalmatians, and Bosnians) have been surmounted.    A representative meeting of delegates, of all the Serbian parties  has  decided  on a coalition ministry for  Serbia  representing them all and  determined to  uphold (? the geneva) pact.   This  has Prince AlexadeFs sanction, conveyed through M. Pashich whosepresent ministry retires.   In the new ministry he will be president without portfolio.    The position of the common Serbo- Jugo-Slav Government  established by the pact of Geneva is  thus   consolidated.   It consists of  six  members, and  for its completeinstitution they are only awaiting the arrival of a Serbian member, Gagrilovich (a  very good man), from Corfu.  This central Government will  have in its hands foreign affairs and peace conditions, army,  navy, post, telegraph, communications, &amp;c. ;  as  far as the outside world is concerned it therefore represents the complete fusion of Serbia and allthe Jueo-Slav lands.    The other two bodies, the special Serbian cabinet and the national council at Agram,will have only provisional existence, until  such time as a constituent assembly  shaUhave been able to work out a complete fusion of the two administrations;  but that, ofcourse, must take many months.  It will be a difficult process, as the provinces formerlyunder Austria-Hungary have such very different institutions and traditions.    Meanwhile the most urgent need is to back  up  the  Government in  its efforts tomaintain order......    I  gather  that  there is a popular anti-Italian movement in Istria,  as  well  as inDalmatia and  the Bocche.   Any joint British force will be a guarantee of peace.   my own belief is that Sebbenico is the most dangerous  centre.    Fiume.-Telegraphing  on the   15th and 16th November [Nos.  869] Sir RennellBodd reported that the Italian Government was sending a brigade of infantry to Fiumeto protect its subjects  and maintain order.  He had also heard from the Minister of marine that a Serbian force was being sent to occupy the place, and that two battalionshad already arrived; as the Italian force had not done so, men had been landed from theships to provide for the maintenance of order.    Austrian and  Bulgarian  Violation  of  the  Laio of Nations.   On  the  14thNovember Sir Charles  des Graz reported [No. 143] that  a note had been received fromthe Serbian  Government transmitting (? 3) official  reports on  numberless  violations ofthe law  of  nations and  on  atrocities and crimes committed in Serbia during the last three years by Austrians and Bulgarians.   The acts, especially of the latter, were statedto surpass all that (? barbarian) s of the darkest periods of history had ever conceived.In  a  further  note,  marked  &quot; urgent,&quot;  the  Serbian Government repeated with all its  might and indignation  its  protest against the  above proceedings, communicatedits  decision to create  an  international  commission of enquiry  into the violation ofthe Hague conventions, and requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint a member on that  commission.  The  Serbian Government  expressed  a confident  hope in  the aquiescence of His Majesty&apos;s  Government to its request, which for obvious reasonswas of a most urgent character.     Neto Coalition Government. Sir Charles Des Graz, telegraphing from Corfu on the19th November [No. 149], reported that a message had been received from M. Pashitch,then in Paris, to the effect that he had formed a coalition Government, which represented the four parties of the Skuptchina, which was to be convoked at once at Belgrade.     Atrocities. On the 19th November Mr. Phipps reported  [No.  16] from Paris  thereceipt of a note from  the Montenegrin Government stating that terror  reigned&apos; in allregions into which the Serbs had penetrated, and that it  had received terrible news of
massacres by them at Podgoritza.  1 The  Montenegrin Government added that if thepresent Serbian Government were allowed to carry out  its plan of absorbing Monte-negro and overthrowing the dynasty, the result would be  fatal : and  it declared thatthe Serbian Government was trying to frustrate the will of the people by all possible means so as to place a fait accompli before the allies.     The Montenegrin Government asked that  an inquiry into  the  matter should  be opened by the British Government, to  whom  it appealed to help its martyred  ally,whose unfortunate people were being murdered in their homes.                                   GREECE.     Strained Relations  with Italy. Lord  Granville reported on the 16th November[No. 1096] that there was a very violent anti-Italian campaign proceeding in  the Greekpress,  and that the  relations between  the two countries were  daily becoming morestrained.  The Italian minister had declared his conviction to Lord Granville that thepress campaign (for which he maintained there was no justification) was inspired by theGreek Government to excite animosity  against Italy,  turning against that country the  anger which might otherwise be  vented on itself on account of  its  incapacity to fulfil the existing exaggerated hopes of territorial expansion.  On the other hand, theMinister for  Foreign Affairs had  assured him  (Lord Granville)  that he was  doing everything he could,  short of censoring  articles, to keep the papers quiet;  censoring, hethought, would make things worse.  The feeling  in  the  country, he said,  was  mostbitter, and the press  merely reflected it.   He had again  and again begged the ItalianGovernment,  both  through the  Greek  charge d&apos;affaires  in  Rome  and the italian minister in  Athens, to take  some  action  which could be quoted to the  Greeks asdefinite evidence of good-will.                                   TURKEY.     Turkey and  Palestine. Lord Kilmarnock, telegraphing from  Copenhagen on the18th November [No. 3424], reported that the military attache had been informed thata Jewish rabbi, Nahum by name, who was a Turkish subject, had gone to The Hague inorder  to obtain a passage to America,  there to intrigue among  the Jews  for againplacing Palestine and  Syria under Turkish suzerainty.   He  was acting  under theinstructions of Talaat Pasha and the German Foreign Office, and the ostensible object ofhis visit to America was the collection of money for poor Jews.     The Turks and  Armenia. On  the  20th November  Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to admiral Calthorpe as follows :      In a debate on Armenia in the House of Commons on the 18th November Lord R.Cecil referred to the  almost incredible outrages which the Armenians had suffered atthe hands of the Turks.   After stating that Cilicia would  be occupied immediately, he went on to say that we  could not permit  the evil forces which had been predominant in constantinople to remain  predominant  in the  Government.   Our object was the liberation of all those who were entitled to our protection.     He shared to the full the view that  the enemy in  this matter  was the TurkishGovernment.  He believed it to be true that not one of the atrocities in Armenia hadbeen the result of casual ferocity, of  isolated Turkish brigands, or even of the misdeedsof local governments ; they had been ordered from Constantinople, so far as  he knew,in every case.   That was the central fact to be recognised  in dealing with the situation.It was not a religious question.   The Arabs had always protected  the Armenians, andwhen the British army came to  Aleppo it had found several bodies of Armenians livingthere under the protection of the Arabs.  And  in  the same way there was no reason why the Kurds and Armenians should not live perfectly well together if once Turkishinfluence were removed. There were  signs already that  the  Kurds and Armenianswere prepared to make terms with one another and to arrange to live together.     There were symptoms  that even now the Turks had not learnt their lesson.   even now they were showing signs of trying to carry on their old policy of delay, and of raising with incredible fertility every kind  of objection, and if they had the opportunitythey would try their other device of setting  one European  nation against another.With a full sense of responsibility he said that those days were ended (Cheers), and theTurks would make a profound mistake if they did not realise that their power of delay and  resistance was finally finished.   They were now absolutely in our power, and theonly way by which  they could hope to  receive clemency of consideration would be if       [898-122]                                                        C
they  showed that they had really mended their ways, that they would hasten to carryout the terms of the armistice to which they had agreed, and the other conditions whichwould be put upon them by the justice of their conquerors, without any hesitation andwithout  any attempt to avoid  doing  that which would certainly be forced upon them.(Cheers.)     You should give widest publicity to this.                                  ABYSSINIA.     French Activities. Mr.   Campbell  telegraphed from  Adis  Abeba  on  the- 11thNovember [No. 89] reporting  that he had grounds for believing that the Regent wasbeing  urged by  the  French minister  with  a view  to the elimination to the utmost possible extent of Italian and British interests in the final  settlement  of Abyssinia, togrant the French paramount interests in  commercial  and other matters.  Telegraphingagain on the same day  [No. 97] he, Mr. Campbell, reported that the Regent had been persuaded  by the French  minister to prohibit the sale or purchase of slaves or arms.This had been done without any  consultation with his colleagues.  The reason urgedwas  that such a prohibition would bring  Abyssinia  within the teimis  of  the Brusselsconvention, so that the export of the rifles  at Jibuti could no  longer be opposed by great  Britain  and Italy.     European Counsellors. [E.R. XCII, p. 4.] Telegraphing on the 11th November[No. 96] Mr. Campbell reported that, so  far, only Ras  Kassa had given the Regent hissupport in his projected  reform,  which  was  being  strongly opposed by the Ministerof War and the Empress.  The Regent, however,  was  secretly  in communication withthe provincial chiefs, and  would convene the proposed meeting should their replies be favourable : but he feared failure,  and in that case European intervention would, hethought, be inevitable.  In the meantime brigands held practically every caravan route,and lawlessness was on the increase.                                     ARABIA.     Message to King Hussein and his Reply. Sir Reginald Wingate reported on the12th November [No. 1673] that the following message from His Majesty the King  hadbeen sent to King Hussein :      On  the  occasion  of the signature of the armistice with  Germany  I offer your highness my cordial congratulations on the victory gained  by the allied armies in thecause of  liberty and justice.  I pray a lasting peace may now ensue  that will heal thewounds of the past strenuous and eventful years, and will secure  for  all peoples anew  era of moral  welfare and material prosperity.    And on the 15th November he transmitted [No.  1701]  King hussiens reply :     Your Majesty&apos;s gracious message touching the  great  and final victory of rightover might has greatly honoured  me.  It is to the steadfastness of the great advisersof nations that with God&apos;s help this victory is due.    I  implore Almighty  God  to  support your  Majesty, granting you ever  his pro-tection, and adding glory  to  your Majesty&apos;s  throne;  I  pray  God  also  to preservehenceforth for all peoples, at all times, the peace and  prosperity which by the nobleefforts of your Majesty&apos;s great nation  have been won for them.   (Signed) HTJSSEIN.     Anopher  Message  from King Hussein. On the  18th November  Sir ReginaldWingate transmitted [No. 1721] the following  message for  his Majesty the King fromthe King of Hejaz :      To His Majesty the Most Eminent King-Emperor George.     I have, in the happiest hour of my. life, received your imperial and -royal and mostgracious letter, which has been handed to me by your Maiesty&apos;s eminent agent at Jedda.It is beyond my power adequately to express my dutiful gratitude for such imperial andnoble feelings. I can only say  that I and all my family will preserve this most graciousletter  as our  most gracious treasure, and the greatest  pride of our  lives.   May Godprotect you and  assist your  Majesty&apos;s  noble  nation.  Your Majesty&apos;s  most, sincerefriend.   (Signed) HUSSEIN.     Medina. Sir Reginald Wingate  reported  on the  15th November  [No. 1698] that,apparently because Fakhri Pasha was unwilling to act  on instructions which had been
sent by wireless in plain language, negotiations for the surrender of Medina were notproceeding.   Sir Reginald Wingate suggested  that the Turkish Government should be requested to repeat the instructions in cypher.                          SYRIA  AND  PALESTINE. &apos;     The General Situation. On  the  18th  November General  Clayton  telegraphed[No. 190] a lengthy report on the attitude of the various peoples of Syria and Palestine.     In regard  to the  Arabs he said that those in Palestine were very apprehensive  ofZionist aims and strongly opposed, to Zionism.  In the earlier days  of the  occupationthey were pro-British,  but on account of a growing conviction that Great Britain waspledged to the  Zionist  programme in its entirety they were showing a tendency to turn to the King of Hejaz  and the Arab government at Damascus ; they thought that theestablishment of an Arab Government in  Palestine  (which they believed would be supported by Great Britain) would reduce the danger of  Zionist predominance.  Thoseof Syria for  the   most  part wanted  an independent Arab  government,  but  wereapprehensive of reactionary sherifian  influence :  but there was  a small party whichdesired a purely sherifian government for the  most part its members were fanaticalMoslems and  &quot; Young Arab&quot;  hotheads who also displayed  a certain anti-Europeansentiment.  The majority were deeply distrustful of the French and equally opposed to french penetration : they realized the  necessity of European advice and assistance, butwished both to come from Great Britain.     The Druses of Jebel Druse and the Lebanon had had long-standing feuds with the neighbouring Arab tribes, and in consequence were anti-Arab.   They had, too,  for long been practically exempt from control and taxation, and therefore viewed with misfavourthe  establishment of any government which would subject them to both.   They wereanti-French from long  tradition and deep-rooted sentiment: their traditional sentimentmade them pro-British.     Of the Christian population,  the  Syrians in  the coast area  were anti-French, butthe Maronites were almost to a man pro-French.  All were anti-Zionist.     In regard to the French,  their  intentions in Syria were  distrusted : the  universalimpression was, it would seem,  that their intention was to make the Syrian coastal areainto a French colony.  Egypt and Algeria were frequently compared to the detriment ofthe latter.     Passing to the Anglo-French  agreement, General  Clayton said that  from  an administrative point of view it presented almost insuperable  practical difficulties.   Ifthe  Arab  Government was to be efficient  it  must have  a  system of administrationapplied to its whole area, whereas the agreement divided the Arab territories into two parts, and laid, down that for one half France should provide advice and assistance andthat Great Britain should do the like  for the other.   For many years to come such advice and assistance would entail a considerable measure of actual administration, andthere  was a wide difference between English and French methods. The result would beconfusion and inefficiency, with probable friction between France and Great Britain.     In his opinion, it  was of the utmost importance  that  the chance of such frictionshould be precluded,  and having this in view he suggested as a solution that france should be the trustee of an autonomous Lebanon, including Beirut and the  Bekaa, andof air autonomous Armenia, including the port of Alexandretta ; whilst  Great. britain should be the  trustee of Palestine, and  the  adviser  of the  independent  Arab  state,which should include the sanjak  of Tripoli and Latakia.   Given  this arrangement, theeconomic&apos; interests  of France  could be as well safeguarded as under the agreement of 1916 ;  and in addition the  settlement of  the  Zionist  question  would  be greatly facilitated. &apos;     In conclusion, General Clayton pointed out that with a sound  administration atDamascus, the arable country east of Jordan could be developed ; those districts werethinly populated,  and  their  development  would provide for  Jewish  expansion  by emigration from Palestine.   Finally, he  said that the complete fulfilment  of Zionist aspirations could not be looked for at once :  undue haste would react unfavourably.     Reception of the Franco-British Declaration. On  the  16th November General Clayton reported [No.  185]  that  the omission of any  mention of Palestine in the Franco-British declaration had caused comment, but  the general impression appearedto be  that it would apply to Palestine  as well as  to Syria,  and both Christians  and Moslems were relieved by what they regarded as a check to extravagant Zionist-aspirations.
        At Beirut all, whether Christian or Moslem, save the Maronites  were jubilant, the;&apos;   impression produced  being that Syria was to choose her own form  of government.   The Maronites, on  the  other  hand,  especially  those  holding  official posts,  were   somewhat upset.        At Damascus there was a great demonstration, culminating  in a visit to the office   of  the  British and  French liaison  officers, where  speeches were  made  expressing   gratification  for   the  declaration;  to  which  the  French  liaison  officer  made  a   suitable reply.        Appeal against the Arab Government. From a telegram sent on the 18th November   by  General Clayton [No. 193] it appears that Sir Reginald Wingate has forwarded an   appeal against the Hejaz &quot; intrusion into the government of Damascus.&quot;   This appeal   was signed by 200 Syrians, Moslem and Christian, but on examination General Clayton   found that the large majority of the signatories were men  of no importance, and that   only seven of  them  were Moslems.   A considerable  number had for  some time past   been connected with the  French agency  in Cairo.   Five  or six were obviously not   Syrians but Armenians.  General Clayton was of opinion that the appeal could not be   accepted as an expression of the views of the Syrians living  in  Syria, or even of a   majority of those  living in Egypt.        Aleppo. General Clayton  reported on the 14th November  [No.  184] that the   press had been politically discreet, but the Christian population had misgivings as to its   future under the Arab flag.  The courts of justice were working, and 250 gensdarmes   had been enrolled, but there was a good deal of corruption, and  Christians complained   of police injustice.        In the country districts the villagers were afraid  to sow because of Bedouin raids.        Haifa. Telegraphing  on the 19th November [No. 195]  General Clayton reported   that an increased desire was being shown  by the Moslem community to work loyally   under our administration.        Jaffa. General Clayton also reported [No. 195]  that at Jaffa general  satisfaction   had been expressed at the cessation of hostilities and the victory of  the allied Powers.   Also, that on the anniversary of the release  of Jaffa from  Turkish rule, the  mixed   committee of Christians and Moslems had held a reception to express  its appreciation of   the British administration.                                      ARMENIA.        An  Armenian Appeal. On  the  19th  November  Sir Horace Rumbold reported   [No. 2240] that Professor Herron had communicated to him the text of a telegram he^  had received from Dr. Yarandjan, the Armenian leader who was in charge of Armenian   foreign  affairs, and who  had recently arrived  in Switzerland from Paris.   Dr.  Herron   was also sending this telegram to United States Government.   It ran as follows :         I  have just  received  by special courier the following news from Armenia:  In  the   midst of the horrors of the Turkish invasion, deprived of all exterior help, betrayed by   their neighbours  who at  the beginning went over to the enemy, the Armenian  people   with superhuman efforts  was able to create in the biblical region  of (? Ararat),  the   cradle of (? civilisation),  an independent republic  free of all  Turco-German  influence,   a republic recognised by the 2,000.000 Armenians of the Caucasus as their legitimate   organ, as the nucleus of the great future republic of Armenia, which, under the protec-   tion of the allies, will extend over all Russian and Turkish Armenia.   The  3,000,000   Armenians who have escaped from Turkish barbarism hope  that, in accordance with   the principle of the  self-determination of  the  peoples, the allied Powers will recognise   the existence of this Armenian republic, which  is an accomplished fact.   The Armenian   [group undecypherable] whose 200,000 soldiers have been fighting  for four years in  the   allied ranks on the oriental, Caucasian, Palestinian, and Syrian fronts, hope that all  our   rights as a belligerent nation will be recognised ; that the future peace congress will   give  full satisfaction to Armenian claims ; that  the  allies will  have  the &quot; sinister   assassins &quot; punished.   We demand necessary reparations, and ask to be furnished with   means for the regeneration of Armenia, the greatest victim of this vindictive war.        Dr. Herron  added  that he had had appeals  to the  same effect from all  the   Armenian leaders who, mistaking the  armistice for a  treaty of peace, seemed to be in a.   state of  considerable apprehension as to the future of Armenia.
     Relief. General  Clayton  reported  on the  19th November [No. 194] that thecommander-in-chief had sanctioned  the  sum of 2,600L being devoted  to  the relief ofthe Armenians in Aleppo.     Protest  of Armenians  in Egypt.-Sir Reginald Wingate reported  on the 18thNovember [No. 1716] that he had been requested  to telegraph  the  protest of the armenian  National  Union of Egypt  against  the omission from the conditions of thearmistice of a stipulation that Cilicia and the six Armenian vilayets should be immediatelyoccupied by the allied troops.   The union asked that the legion d&apos;Orient should be sentto Armenia, and that use should be made of the Caucasian Armenian troops.                                  KURDISTAN     Suggested Kurdish Confederation under British Protection. The political officer at baghdad  reported on the 16th November that he had that day received  a deputation from the  principal Kurdish  families (resident  some in Baghdad, some  elsewhere), whourged that Kurdistan  should be taken under  British protection to give it a  chance oforderly progress.  One of the leaders of the deputation suggested the possibility of aKurdish confederation, and the suggestion was enthusiastically received, the  necessityof including all Kurds  therein being urged : and the leaders explained that  theysidered the British Government alone  capable  of  creating such a  confederation  as, inthe  eyes  of  the Kurds, the  French were disqualified on account of  their traditionalposition as the protector of Christian communities.     On the same day the civil commissioner at Baghdad reported that Major Noel had telegraphed that, provided prompt and vigorous action were taken, he  did not foreseemuch difficulty in creating a Kurdish  state, which should  be under our protection andhave its general policy controlled by our  political  officers :  the movement was so strongthat he strongly advised qualified officers being sent immediately to take charge of theprincipal administrative services.  The civil commissioner said that he was arranging forthis to be done, and would, as  soon  as possible, consider  Major  Noels further advice that a similar movement should be initiated at other  centres to  the  north of Mosul.He added that he should endeavour  to attend a conference of Kurdish chiefs, fifty to.sixty of them, at Sulaimaniyeh, which Major Noel was arranging for  the  end of thismonth.     Telegraphing  again on the 18th  he reported a  message from Major  Noel to theeffect that in southern Kurdistan the Turkish garrison  and officials  had been takenprisoners by the Kurds,  who invoked  British  assistance to form a tribal confederacy :the move  for self-determination under  British auspices was, Major Noel said, gaininggreat strength.     Sulaimaniyeh. The civil commissioner at  Baghdad also reported that he had beeninformed by Major Noel that Sulaimaniyeh had been  reduced to an incredible state ofdecay and impoverishment by the Turks : the greater part of the town  was in  ruins, and80 per  cent,  of its inhabitants had  disappeared.   He  added  that  there  would besevere famine conditions unless foodstuffs were  supplied  : this  the civil commissionerwas, he said, endeavouring to do.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     The  Anglo-French  Declaration. On the 17th November  the political officer in baghdad  despatched a long telegram giving his views in  regard to the Anglo-Frenchdeclaration, in so far as it concerned Mesopotamia.     The declaration, he said, involved  those on the spot in diplomatic insincerities whichup till now had been carefully avoided, and he  anticipated that in years to come theywould be  faced with a choice between evading the spirit whilst,  perhaps, keeping to theletter of the declaration, and setting up  a form of government  which would not onlynegative orderly progress, but would gravely embarrass efforts made to  introduce stableinstitutions into the middle East.  It would also  place a potent  weapon in the hands ofthose who were least fitted to control a nation&apos;s destinies.     If the future status of Mesopotamia was to be dealt with  successfully it must betreated independently of other Arab problems; for there was an almost entire absenceof political, racial, or other connexion between Mesopotamia and the rest of Arabia.  that other Arabs, whether they came from  Hejaz or from Syria, should have any say in their       [898-122]                                                          D
affairs would not be tolerated by the Arabs of Mesopotamia, who disliked and distrustedthem both.  For them national unity did not mean union  with Hejaz or Syria, but a united Mesopotamia ;  and in the same way they resented the importation of institutionsor methods that savoured of India.     With the experience of his political officers behind  him,  he could  confidentlyassert that, as a whole, the country  had no  desire for any such sweeping scheme of independence as that  suggested by  the  declaration.   The non-Moslem  element clungto our occupation as the fulfilment of the hope of many a generation,  and the  Arabswere content with it :  with  the exception of a handful of amateur politicians in baghdad, the latter were clear-sighted  enough  to realize that there  was a future offair-dealing and material and moral progress under the aegis of Great Britain.     In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that  our  best  course would be to declareMesopotamia, a British protectorate&quot; under which all races would be given the maximum of liberty and self-rule compatible with good and safe government.     Jewish Attitude in Regard to the Anglo-French  Declaration. The  political officerat Baghdad  reported  on the 16th  November  that  he had  on that day received adeputation from the Jewish community in that town.   The members informed him thatthe Anglo-French  declaration had  excited their apprehension, expressed  the general view that an Arab  government would be far worse than the old Turkish despotism,  andurged  the declaration of a British protectorate under which  alone,  they  declared,progress would be possible.     The political agent added that a deputation of Christians was about  to  see  him with a like object.  The  Christians and  Jews,  he said, constituted  more than half ofthe  population of Baghdad and  Basra ; they  were  also the  best  educated and mostprogressive section, and in their hands was the bulk of both the import and the exporttrade.   Failing  the establishment  of a  British  protectorate,  they wished to becomeBritish subjects en bloc, to be assured of protection against Arab tyranny, which they feared more than Turkish despotism, as they regarded the Turks as being more tolerantand  enlightened than the Arabs.  The  fears of the  Christian  and the Jew had somefoundation ; the local Moslem gentry were already telling them that they would before long see  themselves  again under Moslem domination the Anglo-French declarationhaving excited the unbalanced minds of the Moslem.     The Armistice. The political officer  at  Baghdadfreported on the 12th  Novem-ber  that remarkable demonstrations  of enthusiasm had  been  the  result  of  theannouncement  of  the armistice with  Turkey, notably  at   Najaf.   At  this placesome 200 tribal chiefs with their followers, together  with the  religious dignitaries  andnotables of the town, had paid a  congratulatory visit  to the political officer : in all, some,000 persons participated.     Projected  Reforms. The political officer at Baghdad telegraphed  on the 10thNovember outlining a scheme of reforms which he proposed to  put into operation.     Having noted that the maintenance  and development of the tribal organization  had formed part  of our Mesopotamian  policy,  but  apart from that organization the onlyindigenous institutions which afforded  any  opportunity  for  the local population toparticipate in  the management of their public affairs were the municipalities  of theprincipal towns, which were now in a fairly sound financial condition, he went on to saythat he was  instituting  at Basra and Baghdad municipal councils on lines evolved bythe  military  governor of the  latter place  in  consultation with  its principal notables.These councils, which would consist partly of elected  and partly of nominated members,would enjoy, in regard to the municipal revenues, considerable financial powers.  Thescheme, which had been approved by the G.O.O. in C, would come into operation onthe 1st January.   Similar councils would be set up in other towns, but  with less amplepowers and under somewhat closer tutelage, as in them the general level of civilizationand education was lower.     He was also reviving, with the approval  of the G.O.C.  in G, the institution  ofdivisional  local   councds,  which  had   already  existed  in  Turkish   times in  a somewhat nebulous form ; their  resuscitation  had been under consideration  for sometime.   The object aimed at in their revival was the securing  the  full benefit  of theco-operation  of the large landowners  and  the tribal  leaders in local  administration.Unlike the municipal councils these would at first be purely advisory; and  they would consist of members, not  more than  twelve in  number,  nominated by the divisionalpolitical officers.
       The  development of these councils, urban and  rural, would, he  added, greatly  facilitate,  when  the  time was  ripe, the  constitution of an  advisory or  legislative  assembly  for the  whole of Mesopotamia, as  from them representative delegates could  be chosen.                                         PEESIA.       Abrogation of Treaties. Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to  Sir Percy Cox on  the  16th  November [No. 595] instructing him to  make (in concert with his French  colleague) a  declaration to the Persian Government  to  the effect that His  Majesty s Government^ must insist upon  the maintenance of the status quo till  it should be possible to regulate,  after appropriated negotiation, the position of British subjects in Persia from the points  of view of their status and their juridical position.  His Majesty&apos;s Government could not  recognise  the unilateral abrogation of treaties and conventions under which  they  were  entitled to benefit.       Persia at the Peace Conference. Sir Percy Cox reported on the 18th  November  [No. 981] that on the previous day he had had an audience with the Shah, who had referred  to the  question  of  Persia&apos;s representation at the peace conference, urging that her  position was exceptional, as she had been made a theatre of war by both parties.   He  tad  requested  Sir Percy  Cox to tell Mr.  Balfour that in his (the Shah&apos;s) opinion it  would greatly improve our position and facilitate our future policy, if it could be known  that  our  friendly relations had  brought about Persia&apos;s official representation at the  conference.
