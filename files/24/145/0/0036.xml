In telegrams [Nos. 256, 259, and 266], despatched betweenthe 21st and 25th November, Sir Charles Eliot noted :  (l) That Admiral Kolchak had announced that he  had  no intention of restoring the  monarchy ;  (2) that GeneralHorvat had announced his adherence to the new regime; (3) that he had been informed by  the agent  of  the Omsk Government that General  Semenoff had suggested  othernames for the dictatorship, and had declared that if Admiral Kolchak (whom he would not recognise) refused  to act on his suggestion he would proclaim the autonomy of EasternSiberia;  (4) that  the constituent  assembly had issued a proclamation announcing thatit did not recognise the change  of  government ; (5) that, according to reports receivedfrom the consular officers at Irkutsk and Ekaterinburg, the Jews and the Ural workmenwere hostile to the dictatorship, and the upper classes accepted it without enthusiasm,only officers and the cadet party expressing any lively  satisfaction.     Arrest of Messrs. Avksentieff and Zenzinoff. Telegraphing on the 22nd November[No. 258], Sir Charles Eliot reported that Messrs. Avksentieff and Zenzinoff were arrestedbefore the proclamation of  the dictatorship by Cossacks, who, having acted withoutorders, bad been tried and, it was said, acquitted.  The British vice-consul at Omsk had informed  him  that  it was said that over  two million roubles had been  found inM. Avksentieff&apos;s flat.   Telegraphing  again  on the following  day [No.  260] Sir CharlesEliot said that Colonel Neilson, who was in Omsk, had reported that  Messrs. Avksen-tieff and Zenzinoff had been sent, secretly and under guard,  to  China with two others.     Arrest of the  Persian Charge  d&apos;Affaires. Mr. Clive  reported on  the  25thNovember [No. 3503] that the Persian consul  had  received a telegram to  say thatthe Persian charge d&apos;affau7es in Petrograd, Assad  Khan, had  been arrested  there  bythe Bolsheviks and  sent to Moscow as a reprisal for the alleged action of the british authorities in arresting certain Bolsheviks at Meshed;  and that he had also received adirect  telegram from Assad Khan in a similar sense, with a request that it should becommunicated to the Persian Government.  The latter telegram stated that the order forhis arrest was worded as follows :  Explain to the Persian charge  d&apos;affaires that  he isarrested as a, hostage against the arrest on Persian territory at Meshed of the Bolshevikrepresentative, Babouchkine, by order of the British military authorities.
ESTJIONIA.     General Situation. Lord Kilmarnock, telegraphing from Copenhagen on  the 22ndNovember  [No. 3472],  reported that  he had  been  informed  by  M.r. Menning, anEsthonian delegate who had just returned from Esthonia, that a Govei-nment had been-formed on the 11th November, with Mr. Poska as acting Prime Minister and Mr. LarkaMinister of War.  On the 16th November the new  Government  issued a proclamationcalling up a national army of 25,000 men, and the  German soldiers, whose  one desirewas to go home, were handing over some  of their arms- they had already  refused tooppress the native population any longer.     The Government expected to be able to maintain order, but  it earnestly begged forthe presence, at an early date, of some British war vessels at Reval to overawe unrulyelements and avert the danger of an attack by Bolsheviks from the outside.   It begged,too, for corn, as the country had been seriously denuded of supplies by German requisi-tions.  Mr. Menning  added that he  hoped that no attention  would be paid to theBaltic barons,  who were being sent everywhere  to  intrigue against his  Government;there was no foundation for any rumours as to disturbances.                                    POLAND.     Pogroms. Lord Kilmarnock reported  on  the 23rd November  [No. 3481] that hehad received a  letter from the Zionist Bureau in Copenhagen stating that  regularpogroms were  taking place in Galicia and Poland, in many cases led by Polish legionaries,and appealing for immediate effective intervention  by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government ontheir behalf.   It requested him to forward the following telegx-ams which, it  said, were from absolutely reliable sources :      (1.) On the 28th October pogroms against Jews  had taken  place at Krosno andBiecz in Galicia, in which students and Polish legionaries took part ; the police did not interfere, and  many Jewish shops were entirely plundered.     (2.) In the first days of November pogroms took place in numerous Galician towns,among them being Kreszowice,  Niepolomice,  Zater, and Gdow; the greatest  pogromtaking place at Chrzanow on the 7th November.  In the beginning the Jewish  militiasucceeded in preventing excesses against Jews ;  they  were, however,  disarmed  by thePolish  legion, whereupon the pogroms began.  The Polish intellectuals and  the Polishlegion showed themselves indifferent.   Four persons are reported dead, many wounded;damage amounts to several millions.                             *     (3.) The Zionist organisation at Modrzejow  wires that in the night from the 5th tothe 6th November a terrible  pogrom  took place at  Jaworzna  and Dombrowa,  thatdeeds of violence, plundering, assaults, and incendiary acts have  taken place, the Jewsbeing robbed of their whole belongings.    (4.)  The Jewish  national  council  of Cracow  continuously receives reports aboutpogroms in Galicia ; there were pogroms on the 2nd and 3rd November in the followingplaces :   Trzebinina  Dobra  near  Limanowa,   Kolbuszowa, Rezwedow,   MajdakolbPogorzyce, Alwornia, Skawina  and neighbouring places, also in the neighbourhood ofZaborow, Denbica, Wieliczka,  Brzesko, Brzozow, Gorek, &amp;c.     (5.) The Jewish national council in Vienna reports  that the  happenings in  westernGalicia have the character of a regular war of extermination against  the Jewish popu-lation ;  there have arrived already from over 100 places dreadful descriptions of pogromsorganised by the Polish population, especially villagers, led,, and even aided, by legion-aries.  The militia organised by Jewish soldiers  and other young people  was disarmedby the Polish military, after which the assault  on the defenceless Jewish  populationbegan ;  there  are  everywhere a great number of wounded  and dead.  Heartbreakingdetails  are reported from Brzesko, where Jewish  houses were  burnt and the  fleeinginhabitants  shot at ; cellars are full of dead bodies which  people are afraid to bury.After, the occupation of Przenrysl  by  Poles  all the Jewish shops  and houses  wereplundered,  synagogues demolished,  rituals sullied ; many people were robbed, assaulted,and killed.   The J wish national council  in Vienna continuously receives reports aboutnew excesses ;  the situation recalls  the  atrocities at the time of the  Russian pogroms.The Jewish national council has addressed urgent appeals for help to the Governmentsof several countries.                                   RUMANIA.     Visit of Transylvanian Delegates. On the 25th November  Mr. Grahame trans-mitted [No. 1603] a translation of an  urgent  joint telegram despatched by the four
allied ministers at Jassy on the 20th November.  The ministers  reported  the  arrival of delegates from the nationel council of Transylvania, who had come to Jassy to makeknown  their intention  to proclaim the union  of Transylvania with  liumania.  Thiswould be done as soon as adequate protection  against  the Hungarian  troops could  be afforded by a Transylvanian force then in course of formation.                                    GREECE.-     Close Union  with Rumania  and  Serbia. The  following  memorandum  was communicated to the  Foreign Office  by  Messrs.   Venizelos, Pashitch,  and Take. Jonescu :      After a careful-examination of the actual situation,  we have come  again  to  theconclusion that Greece,  Rumania, and Serbia are bound to live in a close union not only for their own sake, but  in the general interest also.     The three States are building their policy  on  the principle of nationality alreadyproclaimed by the Entente, and therefore they  are  entirely in agreement  upon theirrespective future boundaries.     They are decided to strengthen their union now and in the future by all availablemeans.     It  is in this spirit that the three States intend to look at and examine the questionswhich touches them.     On our relations with Bulgaria, we think that the behaviour  of the said  countryand her tendencies, which will remain the same even after the conclusion of peace, donot entitle her to  any good-will from the allies.  The only thing she can ask  for isjustice.     It  is for the future to bring the forgetfulness of the sad events which have come, oneafter the other, since 1913, and then only Bulgaria will be really able to enter in thecordial  union which exists already between our three countries.                                    TURKEY.     Recent Political Events. On the 23rd November Admiral Calthorpe telegrapheda resume of recent political events in Turkey.  After the  conclusion of the armistice,there was open opposition to the Government of Izzet Pasha, which was  regarded as adisguised organ of the  C.U.P.  A suggestion  made  by the Sultan in  regard  to  theremoval of certain ministers provoked a discussion as to his constitutional rights.  Thisresulted in the resignation  of the  Izzet Government, and the appointment of  TewfikPasha to the office of grand vizier on the 11th  November.  Among other  things, thefirman  of appointment prescribed that the unnatural and  illegal proceedings  to whichthe war had given rise  should be speedily terminated.  In regard to its  members  thenew cabinet, Sir Somerset Calthorpe said, was extremely weak  ; they were for the mostpart respectable elderly men without pronounced political antecedents.   On the  18thNovember the new Government presented a programme full of vague promises  to  theChamber of Deputies, which was elected before the war,  and  had had  its legal termprolonged; the greater number of its members were probably faithful  to the  C.U.P.The weakness of the new Government afforded every facility for a renewed agitation infavour  of the C.U.P., which would be  based on. the  resentment caused by the  allegedoccupation of Constantinople by the  allies  and indiscriminate  flag-wagging  in  the christian quarters, especially by the Greeks.                                   ABYSSINIA.     Jibuti Arms Traffic  [E.R. XCV, p. 6]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Lord Derbyon the  23rd November  [No.  2527]  instructing him to urge upon the French Govern-ment that, pending a discussion between the Powers concerned on the general questionof the arms traffic and a possible revision of the Brussels Convention, it was desirable tomaintain  he existing  regulations against the export of arms and ammunition fromJibuti to Abyssinia.  Mr. Balfour added that he was asking the Italian Government tosupport this.                                     ARABIA.HEJAZ.     The  French  Government and Prince  Feisal. Lord  Derby reported  on  the22nd November [No. 1576] that the French Government had pointed out that it had
not been consulted on this  matter, and that its agent in Syria had not been asked for&apos;his opinion.   It  desired to give its point of  view before agreeing to the despatch ofEmir Feisal  or any other delegate of the King of  Hejaz.   Generally speaking,  thequestion of participation in the peace conference must form the subject of precise agree-ment between the Powers.  The right of the  belligerent Powers was incontestable, butthat of  new. states, either recognised  or  unrecognised, was  a subject for discussion.Such  states might be called upon  to  participate in  sittings  specially devoted to their interests, or merely to set forth their  claims and wishes under conditions to be deter-mined.   The French Government pointed  out that in fact only  two new states had!been recognised by the Powers, viz., Poland and Bohemia ;  all the other new states werein process of formation and had not been recognised by the allies as a whole.    The case of the kingdom of Hejaz (which was not the Arab kingdom, and had  beendistinctly limited to Hejaz by France and  England in  1917)  was  special.  Apart fromthe English and French, it had not  been recognised by  the Powers.   It was therefore(? not) admissible that Emir Feisal  should leave Syria on an English ship as a delegateof King Hussein and of a hypothetical Arab kingdom.  The most  that could be donewould  be for the  Emir,  after  agreement  between  the  two Governments  specially interested,  to be allowed to come to France as  a private envoy of the King of Hejaz inorder to plead the cause of an Arab group which  should only  be constituted under therespective supervision  of the English  and the French, in the zones  where  the  twocountries have  defined their limits and  their civilising  mission. The French Govern-ment added that Emir Feisal  could only come to France under the above-mentionedconditions.    These  points were further considered in a subsequent memorandum presented bythe French Minister for  Foreign Affairs,  a translation of which  was  transmitted byMr. Grahame on the 24th November [No. 1598].   In the course of this memorandum itwas stated  that Feisal was unable to speak in the name of Arab populations, who in thepresent state of affairs could net be freely, validly, and seriously consulted.    Whilst in France he  would be treated as a  distinguished foreigner, but he wouldbe at once informed that bis qualification  for  any purpose must  be discussed by theallies, and that he could not be admitted as the  Arab representative to any meeting ofplenipotentiaries till a formal agreement on the subject had been  arrived  at by thoseallies.   The Minister for  Foreign Affairs hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldmake a similar statement.    Medina [E.P. XCV, p. 6]. Sir Reginald  Wingate reported on the 22nd November[No. 1739] that he had heard from  Jeddah that the Arabs were becoming exasperatedat the delay in the surrender of Medina.  The Arabs threatened attack and reprisal, andthere seemed to be danger if the present  situation&apos; were  maintained indefinitely,  thatthey would get out of hand.   He had  impressed  on the King  of Hejaz  that any actionin violation of the armistice must be prevented.                                MESOPOTAMIA.   . The Shayhks of the Nasiriyah  District. The political officer  at Baghdad reported on the 20th November that two days previously  he had met a large and representative body of  important  shaykhs from every part  of the Nasiriyah district,  who  alreadyconstituted an informal divisional council.   They  spoke quite freely, and were evidentlynervous as  to  the  working of  the  Anglo-French declaration,  which they apparentlyfeared was  a preliminary to the handing back  of  their country to the  Turks or somelike form of oriental Government; they  enthusiastically greeted  his assurance  thatthis would  not be  the  case.  One of the oldest of those present declared that Iraq had long been ill-treated by her former  husband, the Turk, and  she never wished to see him  again: she  was  now  the  Arab  bride  of the  British  Government,  and  shewished for nothing  better than to  continue to live&apos; under the protection of her  newspouse from  whom she  had  received good and  affectionate  treatment a  sentimentwhich was  received with every mark of enthusiastic concurrence.  Two years  ago  theshaykh in question was fighting against us.    The political officer  added  that similar views appeared to prevail in Kut, QalatSikar, and  Hai, which he had visited on his return.o
