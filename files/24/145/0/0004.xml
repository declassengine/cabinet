SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT. No.  LXIV.    This week comment is almost superfluous.    The Russian situation shows no change.  The  Caucasus is in too uncertain a state to enable any conclusion  to be drawn    In  Palestine  we must await this weeks report on general affairs from GeneralClayton:    The King of Hejaz&apos;s communications are useful, as showing an improved tone inHejaz itself.    The Persian situation is still menacing.                                                                        M. S.    April 18, 1918.

Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed on  the  11th  April  [No. 87]  that though the  Bolsheviks  were not popular  they were the  only power  at the  presentmoment in Russia ;  they were stronger than any other  Government had been since therevolution, and they were not afraid to use their force, which was well organised.   Fora considerable  time to come no counter-revolution could be successful without Germanhelp; as to this,  there was no serious opinion to the  contrary.  They were opportunistswho wished to remain in power, and, therefore, would treat with anyone who would help them to carry out their policy.  They were not pro-German, and, indeed, they had little to hope for from Germany ; but though they inclined to a pro-ally policy, they would not hesitate to bargain with the former Power if the allies drove them to extremes.     Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 91] he said that  the tone  of  theirpress in regard to the Germans had been quite satisfactory from our point of view, andin consequence the  German  Government  had already protested officially.  Of all theBolsheviks, Radek was the most bitterly anti-German ;  his conduct at Brest  was a sureguarantee that  the main characteristic  of his policy  would  certainly not be  pro-Germanism.   And Radek had been appointed  to the Ministry for Foreign  Affairs forthe express purpose of dealing with the Central Powers.     M. Trotsky, Minister of Marine. M. Trotsky  has  been appointed  Minister of marine ; he was  already Minister for War.     New German  Ambassador. Count  Mirbach  is  going  to  Moscow as  german ambassador.
LITHUANIA.     Reasons for the Acceptance of German Terms. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed fromBerne on the 10th April [No. 539] that M. Gabrys, the senior of the three Lithuaniandelegates, had communicated the following explanation to the military attaches depart-ment of the reasons why his Government had accepted Ge.germany&apos;s terms in regard tothe recognition of Lithuanian independence.     Before  the deputation had had the formal interview with the German Chancellor,it was  informed  that, if  it  did  not  accept  Germany&apos;s  conditions, the  GermanGovernment would immediately proceed to annex the country, and leave it no shred of independence.     Under  these circumstances the  delegates decided to maintain  the  attitude  whichthey  had maintained until  the middle of March,  and submit  to Germany&apos;s terms.These included community of coinage, as well as a military and an economic convention,and a German control of railways, posts, and telegraphs.     M. Kairis, the Socialist leader,  had resigned the vice-presidency of  the Taryba,because he did not wish to be directly associated in the final surrender to Germany.Ukraina.     General Situation. In  a news summary which he sent from Moscow on the 11thApril [No. 189], Mr. Wardrop  quoted from the &quot; Rannee Utro &apos;; some  items of news from  Ukraina.   The Great Russians, that paper said,  were being forcibly expelled, andsome of them were forced to labour for the Germans.   Berlin time had been introduced into Kieff.  Hangings were numerous.   The  German  General  Gruener had  issuedproclamations in which he said that the Germans had gone to Ukraina at the request ofits  Government, to  help to free the country from Bolshevist bands and to establishorder.  The Germans therefore were in a friendly country.CAUCASUS.     The Tartars.-On the 9th April Sir  C. Marling  telegraphed [No.  289]  a memo-randum of information which had beeu obtained b3&quot; Mr. Scott from a Russian source.His informant told him  that a restored Russian imperial regime would be welcomed bya large  number  of the Caucasus  Tartars, but  their leaders were too pro-German.  TheTartar leaders wanted part of the northern Gilan and the whole of the Azerbaijan tojoin them under a, Turkish protectorate.   They sent a representative to Kuchik  Khan,who  refused absolutely to agree to the Azerbaijan going to Tartary  : but he took their money and promised to help them against the English.  As showing the strength  of thefeeling against us, Sir 0. Marling mentioned the case of a German, officer who,  beingmistaken for an Englishman, was all but murdered by  the Moslems at Elizavetpol. TheTartars were trying to purchase the Caspian war fleet for 4,000,000 roubles.     Situation at Baku. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 14th April [No. 304] thatthe  Armenian  Bolsheviks were believed  to have defeated the  Tartars:  there werereliable reports  that though fighting continued in the neighbourhood,  it had ceased inBaku itself.                                  ROUMANIA.     Bessarabia [E.R. LXIII,  p.  5]. On the  13th  April Lord Bertie  transmitted[No.  515] a  message sent on the  previous day by the allied Ministers in Jassy.   they said that on the Llth April,  with only five dissentient votes, the Bessarabian  Assemblyhad  proclaimed at Kicheneff the  union of Bessarabia  with Roumania, subject  to thecondition  that a large  measure of autonomy should be allowed to Bessarabia. TheMinisters called attention to the fact that  the  Central Powers had declared that  such a union met  with no  opposition from them ; this appeared to be the case from CountCzernin&apos;s recent speech.                                    SERBIA.     Count Czernins Speech. Sir C. des Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the .12th April[No.  49] that he had seen  a telegram from Amsterdam, published in an  Italian news-paper, which stated  that Count Czernin&apos;s speech was communicated in advance to theSerbian  Government.   He  had made enquiries in  regard to this  at the Ministry forForeign Affairs, and had  been  informed that instructions . to flatly contradict thestatement had already  been sent to the Serbian Ministers in Paris and  London, whowere directed to make use of the telegraphic agencies for the purpose.
    The Serbian Liberal Party.  Sir C. des Graz, telegraphing on the &quot;12th  April[No. 50],  said that the Prime Minister had  given  him to  understand that his twopredecessors, Avakumovisch  and  Georgevitch, were  supposed to  be in Vienna  andinterned;  and that the leaders of the Liberal party, Ribaratz and Velkovitch, who had also remained in Serbia, were equall)&apos;- supposed to be in Vienna, but at liberty.  Inregard to a rumour which had emanated from  Berne, it was inconceivable that they orany other Serbians should  entertain the idea that Serbian territory now held by the bulgarians could be compensated for by other territory in Albania.                                    GREECE.    Opposition/  to  a. Loan from the Allies.-Lord  Granville  telegraphed  on  the.12th  April  [No.  308] that M. Stratos, leader of the Opposition, had made a strongattack in the Chamber on the allied loan of 750  million,  which he  said would  bindGreece to the allies for many years after the war; he referred, to  the assurances givenby Great Britain, France, and the United States  on Independence Day but maintained that they were not sufficient, as Greece had the right to  demand, in consideration ofher dependence on the allies due to the loan and of the  blood  she  would shed in thecommon cause, definite assurances with regard, to Northern  Epirus, Dodecanese, Cyprus,Imbros, Tenedos, Castellorizo, and Mount Athos as well as the autonomy of the Greeks in thrace and  Asia Minor.   This speech was  published  in the  evening  papers  of the11th April but was, by order of M. &quot;Venizelos,  cut  out by the  censor from the morningpapers of the 12th.    M. Venizelos, he said, had replied at considerable length pointing out that it  wasnot the loan, or even her military co-operation,  which bound the Greeks to the allies, buther geographical position and all her interests,  and  adding  that as  rights  supposedby weak hands or a weak will, could not expect much respect, Greece must devoteherself so  thoroughly  and  heartily to  the  struggle as  to  win for herself anincontestable position in the peace conference.                                  ABYSSINIA.    Situation in the Tigre Province [E.R. LX, p. 3]. Sir  R. Rodd telegraphed  from home  on the 12th April [No. 299 I that the reports regarding the  situation in the Tigreprovince, which had come from Adis Abeba, had not been confirmed by the information which the Italian. Government had  received from  Erythrea, where no preoccupationwas felt.  *  Rifles for Ras Taffari [E.R. LIX, p. 3]. In the same telegram Sir R. Rodd saidthat he had learnt  at the Ministry  for the Colonies that they had information whichexplained the French anxiety to deliver 30,000 rifles to Ras Taffari by the fact that thelatter  had already paid for them.    On  the  15th  April  Mr. Balfour  telegraphed a  message  to  Sir .R.  Wingate[No. 530] for transmission to Mr. Thesiger.  Referring  to his  telegram  No. 353 of the1 Lth March  [E.R. LIX, p. 3],  he said that the French Government, on the grounds thatit wished to recruit Abyssinian  natives when the relations with Germany  had been broken and that the rupture could only be brought about  by giving the rifles which.had been asked for, continued to urge that, in addition  to the 3,000 for Ras Taffari,there should be a further  grant of 16,000.   Mr. Balfour  enquired  as  to the  present state  of the negotiations for the expulsion of the Germans.                                  PALESTINE.    The new Guardian of the Holy Sepulchre. Telegraphing on the 9th April [No. LB.10838/7],  General Clayton expressed high approval of the new guardian of the conventof the Holy Sepulchre ;  he said that the  appointment was greatly to the benefit of the jerusalem community, and there were most cordial relations between the guardian andthe military authorities.    The Feeling of the Tribes. In the same telegram General Clayton said that thefeeling of the tribes east of Jordan, in the Salt Areas, and in Maan were not pronouncedlyin favour of King Hussein ; they were rather anti-Turkish and pro-British.
     The Zionist  Committee. General Clayton  also said that the Zionist Committeehad arrived at Jaffa, and was expected in Jerusalem on  the  10th.   It was anticipatedthat much  would be done to dissipate the apprehensions of the Christian  and Moslemcommittees by meetings between leading notables and the members of the commission;                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Congratulations from King Hussein. The following telegrams have passed betweenKing Hussein and His Majesty the  King, the commander-in-chief in France,  and theLord  Mayor of London :      I.  King Hussein to His Majesty the King:      I crave permission to tender to your Majesty my heartfelt  congratulations on themagnificent and unmatched gallantry which your Majesty&apos;s armies on the western frontare displaying at the present time.   That tire banners of the true cause for which theyare fighting with such undaunted bravery may be crowned witlr victory by the Almightyis my earnest prayer and wish.     To which His Majesty replied as follows :      I am  deeply touched by  your Lordship&apos;s message.  It breathes that  spirit  ofconfidence  and unity of purpose winch binds together all trie allied forces on all frontsand in all lands in an unshakable  determination to achieve the  liberation  of mankindfrom tyranny.     (2.) For the commander-in-chief in France:      His Majesty King Hussein commands me to express his wholehearted admiration  ofthe magnificent defence which the British army is maintaining in face of the  german empire&apos;s desperate and  unavailing offensive.   His Majesty begs that his congratulationsshould  be  conveyed not only to the connnander-in-chief but as  Well to  the gallantcommanders and  troops serving under him.     To which the following reply was sent :      His Majestys Government caused your Lordships  message to be conveyed to theBritish  commander-in-chief and the army commanders and troops in  France.   Thecommarider-in-chief,  Sir Douglas Haig, and  his  army commanders expressed their highappreciation or&apos;your Lordship&apos;s sentiments.     (3.) King Hussein  to the Lord  Mayor of London :      I hasten in the name of all the inhabitants  of Mecca to congratulate your Lordshipand the citizens of the great city of London on the inspiring spectacle of the valiant andglorious opposition which with invincible heroism is  being offered to the fruitless assaultsof the German hordes by their fellow-citizens on the western front.     To this the Lord Mayor sent the following reply :      As chief magistrate of this ancient city, I hasten in  the name of its inhabitants  to acknowledge the  inspiring  message of the noble citizens of your ancient and  reveredcapital.  The message of the free  people of Mecca to the freemen of London will everbe treasured among our archives as a testimony  of  the brotherhood of those who fight for liberty.ASIE.     Financial Help for  Idrisi&apos; [E.R.  LXI, p.  2,  and LXIII, p. 4].-Mr.  Balfourtelegraphed to Sir R. Wingate  on the  10th April [No. 505] asking for still furtherinformation as to Idrisi&apos;s past and probable future use of  such money as was being askedfor.   Sir B. Wingate replied on the  following day  [No.  673]  that Iclrisi  seemed to  be definitely committed to military action against the  Turks, and for  that purpose would use all the  money and all the supplies received from us.  He had for months past beenfacing the  Turks, who held the line  between Abs and  Gebel-el-Milh; and there was another force  operating-  in  the  neighbourhood  of Loheiya, whose losses had beenrelatively  heavy.  Idrisis military  prospects were  distinctly  favourable  should the
 necessary supplies and funds be forthcoming.  There was no reason for supposing that, unless he should be compelled by desertion of the tribesmen due to lack  of funds, there was any idea of the evacuation of Loheiya.   His local successes and his pressure on the Turks were having their effect on the Imam  of Sana, and, as it was most important for this personage to be hostile to the Turks, that was another reason for helping Idrisi.     Telegraphing again on the  13th April [No. 686], Sir R. Wingate said that Major Redly, who had left Aden on the 6th April, had reached Loheiya.  He  had found that the  military situation was generally satisfactory, but there was  need of more money. Idrisi, with whom  he had  had a  satisfactory  interview, &quot;was anxious to  continue operations.     Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 531] on the 15th April saying that the proposal for an increased allowance to Idrisi and that for  a present of a  lump  sum  had both  been considered  by the Eastern Committee,  which had refused its consent to the latter proposal, but, in view of Sir R.  Wingate&apos;s urgent representations, had decided that the monthly grant should be raised to 10,000Z.   The military authorities had pointed out that it had not been absolutely established that Idrisi had earned the 35,000Z. which  he had received in the last six months, and  that  therefore it  seemed excessive that  he should receive a monthly  allowance of 12,O00Z.,  as had been suggested, together with a gratuity of 25,000Z.   Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram was in  reply to  Sir R. Wmgate&apos;s of the 11th April [No. 273], so he added, in reply to that of the 13th April [No. 686], that the decision  of the Eastern Committee held good.                                  KURDISTAN.     Capture of Van by the. Armenians. -Sir C. Marling transmitted on the 12th April [No. 296]  a message from the consul at Tabriz  saying that the Armenians had not only retaken  Van and captured a quantity of military stores,  but had  also beaten back the Turks in the  direction of Batourn.  This news had been received from Tiflis  by the Russian consul-general.                                     PERSIA.     The Shah and the anti-British  policy. Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on the 11th April  [No.  295] that the  Persian Government had sent him from time to time  notes protesting against the advance  of British troops, and he had learnt that on the previous day the Prime Minister had asked the Shah to give the Cabinet full powers to  deal with [? the situation].  The Shah, receiving an affirmative reply to his question as to whether this  was asked  with a  view to the adoption of a more vigorous policy against the British,  refused to do  what he had been asked on the ground the Cabinet was already-showing sufficient hostility.     The Jangalis and the  Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on  the  13th  April [No. 302] that Persian information in Teheran pointed to the Jangalis striking a blow at that  place  via the mountains in the north, and the Cossack  division was the only force  by which this  could be  met.   The  Cabinet, being in close  relations  with the Jangalis, would forbid it to act and the Shah would probably give no orders on his own responsibility on account  of his timidity.  Without orders from one or  the other it was doubtful, whether the division would  act.  Consequently the dismissal of the Cabinet was a necessity, and Sir C. Marling proposed to obtain an  audience for the purpose of urging this.   He also proposed, if the Shah promised to bring in  a Cabinet pledged to oppose the Jangalis and to maintain  friendly  relations with us,  to give him  the assurances  previously sanctioned by Mr. Balfour  in the event of his having to leave Persia.   samsam--es-Sultaneh  would probably  be the head  of the new Cabinet, which would only be a stop-gap.     Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 16th April  [No. 205]  approving  Sir C. Marling&apos;s proposed action.      Request for Financial Help for the Jelus. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on  the 9th April [No. 288] asking for instructions in regard to  an application which had been made through the Russian consulate-general in  Tabriz to  His Majesty&apos;s consul in that place.   There was a force at Urumia known  as the Jelus, consisting, of Nestorian levies, commanded by a Russian officer who  had stated that the. ammunition of this  force was almost exhausted and the force itself impaired,  so that it would  be obliged to return to Van unless it  received 100,000 tomans.   This force was brought into Persia  when  the Russian troops were  ^ withdrawn, it having been originally raised in Turkey.   Were it        [898-91]                      ^                                    C
 withdrawn, the safety of the Christian population  of Urumia and the adjacent districts would be endangered, as  the  battalion which  attacked the Persian  Cossacks near Urumia, and had committed other excesses, especially since the murder of Mar Shiinun, was  a  similar  formation,  if, indeed, it  did not actually form  part  of the force in question.   Sir C. Marling  therefore thought that the supplying of the cash asked for was a necessity ; there was more than sufficient lying in the Imperial Bank of Persia at Tabriz,  but without the  real co-operation of the Persian  Government  it  would  be practically impossible to send so large a sum from  that place  to  Urumia,  and the one. wish of the Government was to bring about the withdrawal of the Jelus.     The consul  at  Tabriz  had  been confidentially informed  that the Tiflis staff had decided to disband  the force; but he was not satisfied  as to whether it would obey such  orders or permit its  Russian  officers  to  leave; the commander&apos;s  idea, however, seemed  to be that if he could get money  he and his officers might escape.   In their own mountains the Jelus were good fighters, but they  were quite undisciplined; and they would probably make their way back, to  the Ju.la.merk districts  and, as  in  the past,&apos;- defend themselves against the Turks unless British officers came to take them over, as they had been led to believe would  be the case.     On the  15th  April Sir C. Marling  telegraphed again [No.  305] saying that the consul at Tabriz had been informed there were in  the Urumia district from 2.500 to 3,000 armed Armenians.   His  informants  were  a deputation of Armenians who had called upon him, and had strongly deprecated the disarming of the Jelus, on the ground that if this were done the  Moslems would  have  the Syrians and Armenians at their mercy.  Enquiries were made by the  delegation in regard to the British officers who they  had  been told by Captain Gracey  would  be  sent by  the Tiflis staff to  drill the Jelus.     The Captured Vice-Cunsul. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 13th April [No. 303] that he had been  informed officially that the vice-consul had been taken back to his house at Resht on the 11th April.   The Persian  Government had urged in consequence that Suleiman Mirza should be released and the bank be reopened.   Sir C. Marling saw no great change  in the situation ; the vice-consul and the bank manager might at any moment be rearrested.     In  reply to this, Mr.. Balfour telegraphed to  Sir  C.  Marling [No. 204] on the 16th April saying that the question of the release  of Suleiman Mirza might  be  recon- sidered if a Persian Government providing adequate guarantees for the future were constituted : but so long as the local situation remained so unstable he did not think that any purpose would be  3erved by it.     On the 16th April Sir  C. Marling telegraphed [No.  312]  that he had  received a telegram from the vice-consul, who  said that he and Mr. Oakshott were in the consulate and well.   All their letters were  detained, and the  vice-consul,  was not allowed  to communicate with the legation in cypher.     Persians in Berlin. Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed on the 10th April [No. 291] that he had  learnt that the Persian representatives  who went to Berlin with Talaat had demanded of the  German Government  that Persia should  take part  in  the  peace conference, but it was believed that they  had accepted the reply that this could only be allowed  if Persia [? were a]  belligerent.  Four other proposals were made to the German Government, but Sir C. Marling&apos;s informant did not know what they were.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.7RUSSIA.    T/ie Anarchists in Moscoio [E.R. LXII, p. 2]. Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed on the12th April [No. 90 J  that  strong action had been taken against the Moscow anarchists.For some weeks  past, he  said, there had  been rumours of  their increasing strength,suggestive of a successful  counter-revolution.  Several of the  allied  consuls were considerably impressed by these rumours ;  and, at last, Colonel Robins pointed out tothe Bolsheviks their serious  effect on  allied opinion in Russia.   As a consequence, theBolsheviks, having secretly organised the business  to  perfection, on  the night of the11-12th April surrounded 26 anarchist strongholds.  Over  600 persons were arrested,and all arms, ammunition,  and artillery captured; whilst the Bolsheviks lost  only killed and 27 wounded.  The leader of the committee which organised the attack told mr.. Lockhart that among the  prisoners were some Russian officers  who had  been indirect contact with the Germans.  Mr. Lockhart added  that the anarchist movementhad undoubtedly been helped by the Germans, whom alone it would have benefited ;  itsdefeat was greatly to be welcomed by  the allies.    Mr. Wardrop in a telegram of  the same date  reports  the same  incident;  hespeaks of the plotters as &quot; pseudo-anarchists&quot; and  repeats that many of them weremonarchists.    A German  Colony. On  the 16th April  Lord  Bertie transmitted [No.  526]  a message from the allied  Ministers at Jassy, who said that, according to trustworthyinformation, Ukraina was being transformed1-into a German colony.   Austro-germans were  taking  the  place of native officials; domiciliary visits  had been  made  on  theconsuls at Odessa with a view to the quartering of Austro-German officers on them ;Austrian and German money had a forced currency; it was rumoured that there was an intention  to  instal a  German Government in place of the Rada :  and orders hadbeen given to arrest  all  Entente officers found  in Odessa ours, so far as was known,,UKRAINA.had already left.o
