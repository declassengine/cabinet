March  Sir  Charles Eliot reported[No.  244]  a very  unsatisfactory condition  of affairs  at Vladivostock.  The reins  ofgovernment were, he said, in the hands of a group of officials who belonged to the oldschool of thought  and who were  out of touch with the majority of the population.They seemed disposed to come to an undertanding with General Semenoff  and with japan ; they had invited the general to visit Vladivostock so soon as his quarrel with admiral Koltchak could be patched up, and they had accepted an offer from Japan forthe  training  of a certain  number  of  troops.  During the last few days five socialrevolutionaries had  been arrested ; they  were said ,to belong  to  the same  section  asChernoff who was ready to  work with the Bolsheviks.   The arrest of fifteen others had&apos;been ordered, but they had escaped.   Peace had so far been  preserved, though therehad been some commotion and much,  talk of a rising.     The peasantry were discontented.   After having left them  alone,  requiring neithertaxes nor military service from them, the government was now  making demands whichirritated them and induced them to  listen to Bolshevik agitators.  Outbreaks  in the villages were probable, but there were sufficient  foreign troops in Vladivostock for the:maintenance of order.     The moderate democrats shrank from acting  with &apos; the Bolsheviks, but they saidthat they  would like to take active measures against  the  bureaucracy.  The relations&quot;between the Czechs  and the  Russians were bad : the  former sympathized with theSocial Revolutionaries.     The Americans, who were commonly supposed to sympathize with the Bolsheviks,lent a  willing ear to the  complaints of  the population, urban and  rural;  and therewas great  indignation against them in official and military  circles with a correspondinginclination to be more friendly with  the Japanese.     As for.Admiral Koltchak, there was but little chance of support for  him in far-eastern Siberia, whichever party should come to the front.                                     POLAND.     Representation  in  Berne. On  the  8th  March  Sir  Horace  Rumbold reported[No. 418]  that the political department had agreed to accept  M.  Modzelewski  assuccessor to M. Zaleski with the rank of charge d&apos;affaires.      M. Modzelewski however had received  a letter from M. Dmowski for transmissionto the  Swiss government,  requesting  it  !o recognise  him as agent of the national committee.  He did not present this letter as  he considered that  it was  desirable  inthe interests of his country that he should hold the same position in  Switzerland-asM. Zaleski, who was in entire agreement with him.        [756]-327 :       &apos;&quot;!   :             &quot;;&quot;  &quot;                             B
                                   TURKEY.     New  Cabinet. -After an  existence of only  a week  the ministry which had beenreconstituted by Tewfik Pasha, was obliged to hand in  its resignation  to the  Sultan,.who charged TJamad Ferid Pasha with the task of forming a new one.  On the 7th MarchAdmiral Webb  reported [No. 484] that  the new cabinet was made up as  follows : Grand Vizier-and Foreign Affairs, Damad  Ferid  Pasha ;  Shaykh-ul-Islarri, Hodja SabriEffendi; Finance, Tewfik  Bey;  War, Abouk Pasha; Marine, Marshal Shakir  Pasha;Interior, Jemal Bey; Public Works,  General Avni Pasha;  Commerce,  Edbem Bey;Justice, Sixki  Bey;  Pious  Foundations, Hodja Wash Effendi; Public Instruction, AliKemal Bey; Posts and  Telegraphs, Mehmed Ali Bey.  To these  Reuter&apos;s agent addedAbdul Kaddi Effendi, as president of the council  of state.     Telegraphing on the 5th  March [No. 475]  Admiral  Webb reported that  DamadFerid Pasha had already sent round an intimation that his only hope  was  in God  andGreat Britain.  He  added  that he was prepared to arrest anyone we demanded, but some financial help must, he said, be forthcoming to enable him  to carry on.   DamadFerid Pasha was, Admiral Webb said, an old friend  of Mr. Hohler&apos;s.     Telegraphing again on  the 7th March [No. 485] Admiral Webb said that the  new cabinet. consisted entirely of adherents  of the Entente  Liberale,  and from the partypoint of view was homogeneous.   The main characteristic of the Entente Liberale partjrwas unrelenting hostility to the committee ; but it had  a  comprehensive programmeHe added the following notes on some of the chief members of the cabinet:      Jemal Bey, the  minister of the interior, had recently shown excellent qualities asvali of Konia.     Abdul Kaddi Effendi, president of the council of state, had no obvious qualifications for the post, but he was thought  to be  of considerable importance as a Kurdish chief,and his appointment was a reflection on the part  Kurdistan played in the  EntenteLiberale movement.     Hodja Sabri Effendi, shaykh-ul-Ldam, was one of the most active promoters of theonslaught on the late government.  He  was honest,  but  quite unreconciled  to theconsequences of the defeat of Turkey.     Tewfik Bey, minister  of finance, was a young man  who had  been professor ofpolitical economy and head of the audit  department.     Ali Kemal Bey, minister  of  public instruction, was a journalist of considerablepower, and one of the most vehement opponents  of the  committee.     The State  of the Prisons. The following despatch  from  Admiral  Calthorpe  was sent from  Constantinople on the 22nd January and received on the 24th February :      In continuation of my despatch  of  the 11th  December,  1918, relative  to theconditions prevailing in the various  prisons in  Constantinople, I  have  the  honour tosubmit herewith  a  further  report as to  what  has  taken. place  in  the meantime inconnection with this matter.     I authorised Commander Heathcote-Smith to make unofficial  representations to theTurkish government regarding the appalling state of  affairs.  With the exercise  of a&apos;considerable amount of moral pressure, and in the face of  the usual Turkish evasivenessand procrastination, some reforms have at  length been carried out.     In order  that it should be quite clear to the Turks that this  high commission was determined to effect  an amelioration of the conditions, Rear-Admiral Webb paid a  visit to the house of detention (&quot; maison d&apos;arr6t&quot;) and the  central prisons in Stamboul, andhe reports as follows :          &quot;1. Maison aVArret. This is the place where men are confined while awaiting     trial.         &quot; In an old tumbled-down building, with a small,  ill-paved courtyard, I found     imprisoned 186  Moslem and  Christian Ottoman subjects.  These were  distributed     among a variety of rooms, each of which I visited in turn.   In two big rooms on the     ground floor nearly all the boards of the flooring had been torn up by the prisoners     for firewood, as also had some of the  supports of the staircase leading to the upper     storeys.  On the ground, which had  been  laid bare by the removal of the boards,     was  an indescribable collection of  excrement and  filthy cast-off rags  of prisoners,-     the whole  being a breeding place for vermin  of all  kinds.  The prisoners were     lying about on the  boards, and sometimes even on the bare earth, and none of these&apos;     had any covering other than the  filthy rags which  still clung round them.  The
-squalor and filth of these dens, the indescribable stench arising from them,, the gloom,even  at  midday, relieved by tiny windows high up near the ceiling, and the totallack of ventilation, all these features formed a scene which I am not likely to forget.     &quot; Of the miserable creatures lying or sitting about on the ground and floors,subsequent medical  examination showed that between 80 and 00 per cent, were suffering  from  the mange (scabies).  Quite  a  number have become consumptivethrough  starvatinn and malnutrition, and many forms of illness,  chiefly typhus andsyphilis,  were raging among them.  There w.is not even a pretence of their being given  any medical attention.  Their diet, which  consisted of a very  coarse andindigestible  bread, is   augmented  once daily  by a  cupful of  so-called  soup,  sorepulsive in taste and smell that even the prisoners in their ravenous hunger oftenturned away from it in disgust.  I smelt it, and the stench was overpowering;  totaste  it was impossible.     &quot; The sanitary  arrangements,  or rather the lack thereof, are best  left to theimagination.  Baths were, of course, practically an  unknown  quantity, and evendrinking water was so stinted that  they clamoured loudly to be given some.     &quot; I he upstair rooms were some few degrees less horrible, inasmuch as the floorswere  intact,  but even here this mob of rotting, ragged, tatterdemalions were livingunder appalling conditions.    ... ,       The authorities  seem to have no concern as  to  sending the sick prisoners  atthis place to any hospital. Lying behind the door of one of these noisome dens I sawa man in  a peculiar attitude, and it only required a second glance  to see that he wasdying, probably from typhus.   In a dark corner in the same room were four forms ;two of these were just able to move,, while  the others  showed no signs  of life.   Itis not difficult to conjecture their condition.     &quot; What made the horror of these places even, worse was  that all were stillawaiting trial ; a great majority had been  there for  over four months,  many fromsix to twelve months, and some as much as twenty-one to twenty-five months.   Itis difficult to understand how any human being could survive twenty-one months or even  twelve months of such treatment, and of course the  mortality has been extremely high.  As an illustration : there was one boy a Greek 18 years old,who had been put in there twelve months  ago with five companions.  Neither  henor they have ever been tried, and  to-day he is wasted to a skeleton and his fivecompanions are dead.   This case could be multiplied ad infinitum.     &quot; I  then proceeded to the central prisons in Stamboul, and first  visited thehospital  attached to these prisons.  A greater  travesty of the name  of hospitalcould  not be  imagined.  There were  some sixty beds with mattresses literallycrawling with vermin,  on which were lying emaciated shrunken forms covered fromhead  to  foot with sores and mange ; in several cases two unhappy creatures were placed in the same bed. The Turkish doctor, who came in while 1  was there a smugand oleaginous person -informed me that he  was really very sorry for his patients,but  that he had no funds to supply either decent food, medicine, bed-clothing,  oreven  soap.   The strained anxious looks on  the faces of the inmates of this horribleplace was pathetic  in the extreme, and the joy of the Armenians and Greekswhose removal I at once ordered, was somewhat overwhelming, which is hardly tobe wondered at.     &quot;In the central prisons themselves, wdiere I found over 200 persons working out sentences of varying length, the conditions prevailing were very largely thesame  as those in the maison darret, except  that  the  central prisons are a shademore habitable.owing  to there being  more accommodation.   The mortality here,however, is  as  great  as in the maison darret, i.e.,  about five or six a monthnormally at this time  of the year ; last year, when the prisons were much over-crowded, I am informed the deaths exceeded one daily.     &quot; I  then proceeded to visit the women&apos;s prison and there found a  very  muchsimilar state of affairs, except that the place was somewhat  tidier  and neater.Mange,  vermin,  and  the  same diseases were unfortunately just  as  rampant  asamong the men, and  several of the women had been compelled to bring theirbabies with them, as they had no one to leave them with when they were sent  to prison.  This place contained  females awaiting trial  as well  as  those  servingsentences, and here again many had been waiting trial for many months.     &quot; In virtue of clause 4 of the armistice, I ordered the instant release  of  allGreeks and Armenians who had either been detained unduly long awaiting trial,or who were imprisoned for offences other than purely criminal ones.   The numbersso released were eighteen, including three women.    7563-32?                    &apos;                                   B 2
 j.         &quot; At a subsequent period I visited the military prison attached to the ministry      of war.  -By comparison this place was much better and, for a Turkish prison,; was,      I suppose, just habitable.  The food, too, was slightly better, and I was just able-*&apos;.&apos;&apos;*  &quot;to taste the soup; the taste remained with me for shine time afterwards.          &quot; I ordered the release of all Armenians and Greeks except those  convicted of      had crimes, and one Turk who  had  done  very good  espionage  work for us. ; The      total was one Armenian, fifteen-Greeks (chiefly charged with  desertion), and  one    &apos;  Turk.&quot;                                    V          &apos;                  ,      As a  result of the above visit, and  of the pressure exercised  by my staff,  the Turkish  government have now authorised the inspection of the sick in  the prisons  by British medical officers.   As a result of this  inspection in the maison d&apos;arret, out of 186  prisoners, 48  Christians and  66 Moslems have been  noted for removal.  The Christians  have been taken away to Greek  and Armenian hospitals, and  the Turkish government assures me that they are preparing a special new hospital  for prisoners ; 7,2 Christians have similarly been removed from the central prisons and 15 Christian women.  It is, perhaps, too much to  hope that their present so-called hospital will be improved, although the Turkish authorities have promised to do so.              &apos; ,     With  regard  to  those who have been kept for months without trial, the Turkish government has at last been persuaded to take action iu the matter.   The whole  system is  so honeycombed with bribery and  corruption that it is hopeless to expect any real improvement while the Turks remain their own masters.      New credits have  been voted for better food and clothing, and  for  facilities for . cleanliness  among the prisoners.  In fact 1 have received  abundant promises which  my staff will do their best to see are put into practice, and will, in any case, take -care&quot; that Christians  are not imprisoned again  under the  appalling  conditions described  by Admiral Webb.      Lieutenant Palmer, whom I recently sent on a mission into the interior, reports that the state of the prisons at Eski Shehir  was distinctly better than that of those in Constantinople.  The food was better, and though  the  rooms were dark and over- crowded, they  were much cleaner than those  in  the  capital.   He  also reports  that at Konia the  conditions were distinctly bad.  Two hundred Syrian Arabs were crowded together in a very dark and  badly  ventilated room where the stench was appalling. Deaths had been  frequent in this  room.   I am taking steps to have this looked into and rectified.                                    ARMENIA.     The  Peace Conference. -On the  4th  March  General Clayton transmitted  the following telegram which had been  presented  by the  Aleppo branch of the National Armenian  Union,  with  a  request  that  it  might be forwarded  to  the  prime minister :      Forty thousand Armenians in Aleppo united under the national union,  with  sorrow still deeper than they have hitherto  felt for their  martyrdom,  are shocked  beyonfi measure  to learn  that  they  have  been  deprived  of  representation  at the peace Conference.   The  Armenians  have fought for national liberty and justice, they i have been persecuted and massacred by the common enemy on  account of their friendship for the Entente powers, and they have  offered up victims for their  cause on every front.  These Armenians, in the name of their martyrdom, pray  that their represen- tatives should  be  admitted   to  the peace  conference,   as  those of all  other small liberated  nations,   to  defend  their  rights  in  Armenia  and  Cilicia united.  The Armenian blood which has been so freely shed, and the official declarations concerning Armenia,  made up to now on  every  side, give us every  reason to  hope that  our rights will be protected.     Armenians  in Turkish  Hands. On  the  5th March  Admiral  Webb reported [No.  473] that information had been received that a large  number of orphans who had been detained  in Moslem houses were, in  accordance with instructions  received from the Turkish   government,  being  handed over  to  the- Armenian  community  at (?) Malatia, from whom the information had  been received.  There was a danger  that the government might suddenly  turn out  of &apos; doors all  women  and  children  before the relief committees  could deal with the situation, and  so bring  about their deaths. Admiral Webb was therefore giving a warning that such an occurrence would be treated in the same way as an actual  massacre.        -              .-  &apos; &apos;          ,  &apos;
     Murder of Armenians  in  GiVieia and  Syria. On the 11th March Lord Derbyreported [No. 493] that the &quot; Temps &quot; of that evening had reproduced  a telegram from Salon ica reporting serious troubles in Cilicia, at A dan a,, and in Syria, at Aleppo, resulting in the murder  of  a  number of  Armenians.   In the latter place some fifty Armenians were stated to have  been killed;  and the telegram stated that in both places order was restored by the British authorities.                    ;     The &quot; Temps,&quot;  commenting on  this  telegram, expressed  the  hope that French troops, &quot;unfortunately  too  few. in number  in Syria, and  Cilicia,&quot; would  be sent to maintain order in those districts were France had prestige  to  keep up and  rights to uphold,  more especially  as the Armenian minority in,Cilicia was sufficient  for its own, protection.                                   PALESTINE.     The Jaffa Committee and the Jews. On the 10th  March the  &quot;Times&quot;  published the  following  telegram, dated the 5tb March,  which it had  received from the Jaffa Moslem  and  Christian  committee:  We,  the M.oslem  and Christian inhabitants of Palestine, do not accept  Jewish immigration into Palestine, nor do we agree  to Palestine becoming a national home for the Jews, because  Palestine is a Moslem and  Christian country  and its language has been Arabic  for  the last  twelve  centuries.  The foreign Jews  who  came to Palestine before or after the war  have proved by their deeds and&apos; declarations the impossibility of any social  or economic accord  between the  Jews and ourselves.   We expect only justice from the powers, and our request to them  is to keep our  country for us.  We are the born  sons of the Holy  Land, who  have been accepted by both  the Christian and Moslem worlds as  the inmates of this blessed home, and all the  holy places in Palestine are Moslem and Christian.                                     ARABIA.     The Message to King Hussein. -On the 1st March Sir Milne Cbeetham  reported [No. 321] that Colonel Wilson would convey the message which had been sent  for King Hussein, and that it was proposed that he should do  so. in person after his return  to Jeddah, for  which  place he  would leave on the 15th March.   Colonel Wilson feared that when King Hussein learnt that we regarded  Khurma as disputable, territory there would be an acute crisis, and that the coming- pilgrimage would be seriously imperilled thereby.     On the  4th March General Clayton telegraphed [No. 61A.] deprecating the sending of the message to King Hussein and Ibn Saud.  Should  no definite action be  taken  he would, he said, rather leave things  as they  were than send the message which  he felt wouid be interpreted by both  its recipients as a sign of weakness.  But in his opinion, the time had come for us to take a  definite  side in the  dispute : he considered that we should back  King Hussein and show his rival clearly that we were  doing sO.     King Hussein s Subsidy.-On the 7th March the Foreign Office informed [No. 310] Sir Milne Cheetham that unless some fresh and  convincing reason could  be  adduced for the payment of the  full amount of King Hussein&apos;s present subsidy, the  Treasury would probably insist on its reduction to 80,0OOZ. in addition to  the sum paid to Emir Feisal.     On the  same day, Sir Milne Cheetham reported [No.  350] that King Flussein had pleaded the  necessity of maintaining AbduhVs force, opposed to the Khurma  Akhwan, at war strength ;  the cost of  relief and rebuilding at Medina ;  and his  outstanding liabilities.   Colonel Wilson unwillingly concurred in his strong opinion that there must be a reduction in the April subsidy.  There were, however,, real needs at Medina which involved our prestige as well as  the King&apos;s, and  lie asked whether the payment of a lump sum would be possible.                                     PERSIA.     The proposed visit of the Shah. On  the 12th March  the Foreign - Office  informed Sir Percy Cox [No. 152] that the time had not yet arrived for any departure  from the considered decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government that in  the present  circumstances it was undesirable that the Shah  should  visit Europe, of which decision &quot;Sir Percy had- already been informed.
                                 AFGHANISTAN,     Letter from Amir Amanulla. On the 11th March the viceroy of India reported-that he had:&apos;recbived a letter from. Amir Amanulla, who, after stating the circumstances-&apos;&apos;of his succession,  went  On&apos; to say that  Afghanistan  was prepared to conclude  such agreements with England as might be serviceable to both countries.     The situation at Jalalabad. Telegraphing on the  5th and  7th March  the viceroytransrfrftted telegrams from Sir George Ttoss-Keppel  -to the effect that those acting inthe interests of Amahulla had; the situation well in hand.   Nasrulla and a  number of&quot;safdars and officers had been arrested and sent to Kabul.o
