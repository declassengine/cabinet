APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT, No.  LXV.                                       RUSSIA.      The Russian section of this report deserves close attention.  It is almost impos- sible  to sauge the forces  at work or their value.  The Bolsheviks, it will be seen, are. now  beginning to rule Russia in a more definite  kind of way than  hitherto.   A.s  time goes on it is probable that  the  Bolsheviks will grow less and less theoretical and more ami more practical, and consequently more open  to advances based upon reasonable and material grounds ; however, tliis does no: ready help  matters, since they are  as likely &quot;inder such circumstances to deal with our enemies as with us.                                    ROUMANIA      The unity of  Roumania and Bessarabia is to be noted.                                     PALESTINE.     The junction of the  Arabs and  British is  satisfactory.  The  further north  the Arabs go the better the recruits  which they obtain.     The news of the Zionist Commission  is satisfactory.                                      ARABIA.     The  proposal to establish  a  British hostel at  iVEecca  is at once  practical  and necessary.  With  good  management such an institution  might do  much to counteract the spread of sedition, of which the pilgrinxge was such a rallying point in Turkish times.

Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 10th April [No. 538] transmitting  information in regard to the intentions of Germany vis-a-vis Russia, which he had  received from an allied diplomat.   It came in the first place from a German banker, who in the past, Sir  H.. Runiboll said, had proved to be strikingly accurate ; he gave it to  a subject of an allied Power,  who  had married  a German ; this person in turn told someone connected with his legation ; and the diplomat repeated what he had heard to Sir H. Rumbold.      The banker  told  his  friend that, on account of the precarious  condition  of  her-finances, Germany was obliged to continue her policy of  exploitation, for which  reason her  aim was to prolong the present state of anarchy in Russia.  The revival of a national spirit,  the  restoration of the  authority of the Church, the return of  monarchy,  the reunion of  Ukraina with Greater Russia would follow the restoration of order, and each one  of these  factors would militate against the  German exploitation of Russia ;  the produce of that country would then  of necessity have to be  purchased by German cash, which would  mean money leaving  Germany, money which it was her policy to hold up for use in an economic offensive after the war.     The German banker further said that M. Trotsky was Germany&apos;s occupation agent, and as such he sought every occasion to justify further German intervention, and also, in Germany&apos;s interest, remained in Petrogracl.  In.order that the allies should squander further  treasure, which would fall  into German hands, he spoke of the regeneration of the  army, so enticing them to furnish material and financial  aid.     This report was repeated to  Mr.  Lockhart [No. 69], who dealt with the  various. charges in a telegram [No.  104] sent on the  17th April.     In regard to the statement that the Germans wished, for the continuance  of the state  of anarchy,  Mr. Lockhart pointed out that  there were two groups in Russia desirous of the return of  monarchical government.   One  of them simply wished for it as a means for  the restoration of order, and would be quite content  with  such a restoration  without the monarchy.   The other  group was openly pro-German ;  and in view of the favourable attitude  of Russian  aristocratic and  commercial circles,  it was hardty likely  that the magnificent opportunity afforded  by the  present state of affairs would  be thrown away by the Germans, whose  whole policy was  based  on the assumption that they had come to restore order.       [898-92]
      Germany was trying to persuade us that MM.  Trotsky and Lenin were its agents,  obviously to prevent  the allies from coming to an understanding  with  Russia;  and  (I  numerous  documents  might be explained by this fact.   We were asked to believe, in  the face of their past history and their bitter  struggle for the past twenty years, that  men such  as  those named above were now working in the interests  .of  German  imperialism.      The statement  that M. Trotsky was in Petrograd was untrue.      The fact that the Bolshevists, basing  their  hopes on  the  chance of a democratic  peace, had destroyed the army was the substance of  the chief  argument used ao-ainst  them.  But it must  be remembered, that Russia herself warned  us before the revolution  that peace could not be delayed, as the Russian people were tired :  after the revolution  this had been repeatedly pointed out.  The plain fact was that ninety per  cent, of the  Russian people had realised that they were tired of the war ; to this, and not to German  gold, the Bolshevik success must be attributed, even if it were admitted that the leaders  were Germans in disguise.  If M. Trotsky was a German  agent, then a German  agent  was the leader of a party which  daily became more and more antagonistic  to Germany.  Mr. Lockhart was of opinion that it was a little too much to believe  that there  was a  secret understanding between Bolsheviks and those, who were  fast shooting  the Red  Guards in Finland, in the Baltic provinces,  and in (Jkraina : all  the  evidence, he said,  which he had been able to collect went to prove that the Bolsheviks were not pro-Gerrnah  whatever else they might be, and this was shown  even by evidence coming from sources  which were violently opposed to them.      Finally, in regard to the suggestion that M. Trotsky was playing for allied financial  aid in order that  the treasure  might pass into German hands, Mr.  Lockhart pointed out that the Germans would have to capture it  by forces  presumably brought from the  western front, a transfer desired by ourselves ; but as a matter of fact M- Trotsky had not  asked  for  treasure,  but  for advisers  and  specialists to help  in  reorganising the army.      Position of the Bolsheviks. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 13th April  [No. 93] saying that he had had  a long  conversation with a  gentleman  whose views were  of peculiar value;  he had held an important position under the Government;  he  was the greatest living authority on local Russian self-government ;  a landowner ; one of the very finest types of Russian; a firm adherent of the allied cause ; and an  ardent lover of his country.  Speaking of Bolshevism, he  had said that  the economic forces  which  were working against it would probably bring about  its disappearance ; but  this  would not be done  in the immediate future, and without foreign  help  there would be but small likelihood of success for any counter revolution.   In  the meantime the  Bolsheviks  were ruling Russia by the  method -of the old regime;  ie. by force, against the wishes of the people.  The leaders  were fearless and energetic men, who  had created a government machine which  was  not  inefficient however unjust and imperfect it might  be; the Bolshevik  Government was the only  powerful, one the country had  had since the revolution.   As for the Constituent.Assembly, it was dead  and  it would be a mistake to revive it : Russia was not fit for such a system.     Prisoners of War. Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed  on the  18th April [No.  106]  that Captain  Hicks had carefully investigated  the condition of the prisoners  of war  at Krasnoyarsk and Cloask, and had reported that the result  was  entirely satisfactory ; discipline was very strict and  there  was no cause  whatsoever for  anxiety.   Captain Hicks and the American officer who had accompanied him would  reach  Moscow within a few days,  and Mr. Lockhart would then send a final detailed report.     Telegraphing on  the  16th April ; No. 100] Mr. Lockhart  said  that he had  been informed by M. Tchitcherin that the Russian Government had  received a protest fromthat of Germany in regard to the anti-German  activities  of the  Austrian prisoners  ofwar.   The reply would probably be to the effect that a number  of  the prisoners  had become Russian subjects, but that there was  no activity among them.                                  ROUMANIA.     Bessarabia  [E.R. LXIV, p. 2]. Lord  Bertie transmitted  [No. 543] a telegram,dated  the  19th April, from the four allied Ministers at  Jassy,  saying  that  they, hadbeen informed officially, by the  Minister for  Foreign Affairs, of the union of Bessarabiaand Roumania.
SERBIA.     The  Shuptshina. Sir  C.  des Graz  telegraphed from  Corfu on the  18th April [No. 51] that the declaration  of  foreign  policy made about  three  weeks ago  by the Prime  Minister [E.R. LXII,  p.  3] had  been  approved  by  the  Shuptshina.   The Opposition expressed  its want of confidence  in  the Government and  its  belief  in the necessity for a Ministry of Concentration, but at  the  same time  it declared that Serbia would, remain unshaken in  her national ideal of a union of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, and in her fidelity to the allies.                                  PALESTINE.     The Arab Movement. General Clayton telegraphed on  the  I9tb April that the news of the capture of Kerak  by King Hussehfs forces and  their other successes had stimulated the Arab movement.   The  Ai^abs to the east of the Jordan, who sided with us, were aware that  they would have to suffer in the event of the  Turks getting the upper hand ;  and General Clayton was of the opinion that  in future operations these Arabs  would more actively co-operate  with us.     Zionist Commission. Telegraphing on the . 19th  April General  Clayton said that the Zionist Commission  [E.R.  LXIV,  p. 4] had returned to  Jaffa on the  12th April after  a two  days&apos; stay in Jerusalem.   A reception,  attended by from 4,000 to 5,000 people,  had been held on  the 11th  on the site proposed for the Jewish university; much enthusiasm had been shown and loyal speeches made.   A satisfactory impression seemed to have been produced  by the commission, the members  of which  had made the acquaintance of the leading Christians, Jews, and Moslems.                                     ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Suggested British Hostel, in Mecca.- In a telegram [No. 730] dated the 21st April, Sir R. Wiugate recalled  to mind  the  facts that the  French and Italians had acquired buildings in Mecca which served as  hostels for their  pilgrims, and that it had already been recognised that their  lead entailed  our following  suit.   He had ascertained privately that this would be welcomed by King Hussein, and he submitted that the time had  come for the establishment of a British  hostel ; there was more than one available building which would  be suitable for  one.   For the purpose of  getting a  report on sites and buildings together with estimates of costs, he proposed to send a small Moslem commission to Mecca, including a competent engineer,  which commission would also be able  to  consider on the spot questions regarding  management.  If the arrangements for the purchase  and opening  of  the  hostel  were  to be carried  out  in  time for the next pilgrimage, the report should be made without delay; Sir R.  Wingate therefore asked that he might  be informed at once as to whether the sending of such a commission was approved.     Should the hostel be established there would be two further questions :  one as to the purchase  money,  and the other in regard  to a representative in  Mecca for purposes of supervision.     As to  the latter, in view of the activity of the French representative, Cherchabad. the appointment should not be delayed, and Sir R. Wingate expressed the opinion that the  first nomination should be made  by  the  Indian Government ; the  management of the hostel could, he  said, be put on  a fairly representative basis if the staff included members of other important Moslem communities in the Empire.     As to  payment,  Sir R. Wingate suggested that the purchase should be made, with funds provided by the  British Treasury, on behalf of the Moslems in the Empire ; and that subsequently the purchase money  should be recovered from the Governments of the various dependencies in proportion to their pilgrim interests. ASIK.    Financial  Help for Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed  on  the 19th  April [No. 720] that  he had  communicated  Mr. Balfour&apos;s message of the 15th  April  [E.R. LXIV, p.  5]  to Aden,  and  had received  a comment thereon  to  the  following effect. The Resident was of opinion that Idrisi was fairly entitled to the sum  of 7,200/,., as he had only received 5,800Z. a month for  six months instead of the 7,000L which had beenoriginally promised.   He thought, too, that  the  proposed  rate of 10,000L  a  month
should be made retrospective for  a period  of six months at least.   Sir  It. Wingateadded on Ids own account that he still thought an additional grant both expedient and necessary.   Were it made, a continuance of Idrisi&apos;s activity would be secured ; and, atthe same time, such a grant would  favourably influence our negotiations with the Imam,who,  not  unnaturally, regarded our treatment  of Idrisi as a criterion of  the benefits which might accrue to himself in the event of an alliance with us.&apos;     Telegraphing again on the 22nd April [No. 735],  Sir II. Wingate said  that, as theresult of his investigations, Major Reiliy had reported that he was fully satisfied as tothe bad financial condition of Idrisi and Mustafa, who had incurred  personal  liabilitiesfor payments to the tribes which could not be ,met without our prompt assistance;  thatthe sole obstacle to satisfactorily prosecuting operations against the  Turks  was lack oTfunds;  and that the  funds  hitherto supplied  had been legitimately spent  on thoseoperations.     After interviewing Major Redly and considering his report, the  Resident at Adenhad  emphatically r-enewed his previous recommendations with one  change-that  the monthly subsidy of 12,0O0Z. should be granted only for three months  from the 1st May;the subject could be reconsidered at the  end  of that period, during  which Mustafahoped that the Turks would  be  driven  from both fronts.   Sir R.  Wingate urgentlyasked for  the approval  of  the Residents recommendations;   in  his opinion theirsoundness was unquestionable.                                    PERSIA.     Compensation  for  the  Captured   Vice-Consid    and  Others.- Sir   C.  Marlingtelegraphed on  the  16th April  [No.  313] that  he  proposed  to  ask  9,000i.  com-pensation for the recent outrage,&apos; to be divided in varying proportions  between thefour victims thereof.   Mr. Balfour  telegraphed.on the 20th April  [No. 211] saying that.he approved of this proposal.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     The German Mission. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed [No, 1113] from Stockholmon the  22nd April  that  the papers  of that  elate  contained a communication  fromthe Indian  National Committee  in  Stockholm  of which  following was  a  summary.Kumar  Mahendra Pratag had  recently returned from Afghanistan with a letter fromthe Amir of Afghanistan to the  German  Emperor.   In January  1915   Kumar had come  to Europe on behalf of several powerful Indian princes to  ascertain  whether themilitary position  made it a favourable  moment  for a  revolution in  India.   He wasreceived by the German  Emperor, and joined  the  German  Mission to  Afghanistan,together with Professor Mohammed Barakatullah ; they left Berlin  on the 10th April,1919, with letters from the German Chancellor in the name of the German  Governmentto the chief princes and leaders  in India, inviting  them to  take  part in  the war, andthey  received additional letters  from  the Sultan  and  the  Shaykh-ul-Islam  in constantinople.   They had reached Afghanistan on the 20th April,  1916, and had succeeded  in  persuading  the   Amir  that  it  was  to  Afghanistan^ interest  that india should be delivered from the British yoke.   A long  report  of the  doings ofthe Mission appeared to have been published in the &quot; Vossische Zeitung,&quot;  no date was mentioned.
