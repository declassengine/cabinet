APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXII.                                    RUSSIA.   THE Bolsheviks appear to be drifting into a defensive position, but those who aregainst them do not show  either organisation  nor  pronounced tendencies of friendship) the Entente.  The situation therefore is not the more encouraging.                                   CAUCASUS.   The peril of the  Armenians is extreme, the Georgians do not show signs of givingiem  the support to which  they are entitled.  The  spreading  of artful  rumours oftrocities  perpetrated by  Armenians on Moslems is  usually  the Turkish prelude toiolent aud extensive butchery.                                    ARABIA.   Jemal&apos;s diplomatic advances to Faisal are indications that the Turks are not satisfiedith the military situation in Palestine or along the Hejaz Railway.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.   The events at Kernel a are of extra irdinary interest.  This turbulent city has neverrobably known of an authority  which did not &quot;seek some advantage out of a rebellion.re stern punishment meted out  to the evildoers has not in  all likelihood impressedie people so much  with  the idea of our force as with  the idea that the  action wasiken for the common good.  This is  the probable  explanation of the gift of the  sword&quot; honour.                                    PERSIA.   The situation should be followed  with care, the position is at present very uncertain.

According to the Admiralty wireless press the Russian Governmenthas  sent out the  following despatch addressed to all provincial, regional, district,  andcommunal councils of deputies :      The Central  Executive  Committee is of the opinion that the  transition from a voluntary army to the  requirement  of a general - mobilisation of workmen and  the poorest peasants is imposed by the whole situation of the country.     Because  of the  struggle for  bread and  the activities of the counter revolution,which are both internal and external, and are become all the more shameless because ofthe famine, it is necessary  to begin with the calling up of one of these several classes.     On this basis the Central Executive Committee has decided to order the  People&apos;sCommissariat for war to prepare within  a week, as regards Moscow, Petrograd,  and the don  Kuban regions,  a scheme for carrying out conscription on such a form and within such limits  as  shall  least interfere with the  productive and social life as well as thepolitical life of the cities and regions.          &apos;     To all the Councils institutions the order  is given that  they shall take the mostenergetic and active part in the work of the commissariat for war while it is carrying out its duty in this matter.     Peace Negotiations with Ukraina. On  the 7th  June the  Russian Governmentissued the following wireless message :                                   V,         .     The-Russian&apos;and-Ukrainan  Red Cross societies and similar organisations will take all necessary measures to assist citizens, refugees, and war  prisoners of the&apos; two states who are in foreign  regions.  The two States agree, after the conclusion of the armistice,to permit the transport  of  goods belonging  to either State or to private persons whichhave been prevented from  transit  owing to the military operations.   This permission     &apos; i 898 99]                     r                                ,    .  B  (
2 will also be granted for  goods bought by  private persons or by  either of the States after the time when their exportation is permitted by the States concerned,     The Germano-Ukrainan and also the  council&apos;s troops shall  occupy lines as drawn on the map enclosed with the text of the armistice conditions.  The hue of occupation must be in accordance with the positions of the two armies as a  whole at the moment when the  peace  conference  was inaugurated.  The high commands  of  the Russian and of the Germano-Ukrainan forces shall at once  give orders for the cessation of all military operations.  Each of the armies shall retire  to  the line indicated  for them in those places where that  line has been passed.   Both Governments. Prussian and Ukrainan, agree to help the citizens of the respective States when traversing their respective  territories.  The  Ukrainans coming from  Russia  and Russians  coming from Ukraina are to have the  same rights, and are to submit to the same laws as all citizens of other foreign States.     In leaving open  the question of the co-operation  of railways pending  the final determination  of the peace  treaty, the two  Governments  undertake temporarily  to assist each  other  by  reciprocal  services,  in  respect  to  locomotives,   carriages, platforms,  &amp;c, so as to facilitate the exchange of goods between Russia and Ukraina.     Before the conclusion of the  peace  treaty, the two Governments  will appoint their consular representatives.  The Russian and Ukrainan Red Cross societies, assisted by similar  organisations, shall take  all necessary  measures to facilitate the  return of Russian  war prisoners from  Austria, Turkey, and  Rumania,  and of Ukrainan war prisoners from Germany.     Cession of Part  of the  Murman Coast [E.R. LXXI, p. fj. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed  from  Stockholm  on the 6th  June [No.  1535]  that he had heard that a considerable part of the  Murman  coast, including a part of Eastern Karelia and the Kola inlet, had been ceded to Finland by the Russian Government.  He had heard this indirectly from a Finn of position who had  come from  Helsingfors.     Revolutionary Propagandists sent  to  Italy. Mr.  Woodhouse telegraphed from Petrograd  on the 8th June [No. 246] that  he had been informed that, for  the purpose of revolutionary agitation in Italy, two members of the extreme revolutionary  Left had been sent to that country.   He added that two Czechs would follow and try to murder them.  They were to travel through Germany. THE CAUCASUS.     Breaking off the Peace Conference. Mr. Wardrop telegraphed on the 28th May [No. 363, received the 6th June] that the peace conference at  Batum had been broken off on the  25th May by  the advance of the Turks.  The  Georgians at  Batum had protested ;  but the Turks alleged that enemy troops from Persia  were trying  to expel them from  the  Kars  district, and  that a large number of Armenian troops were concentrated in that of Alexandropol which  had been occupied by the  Turks on the 23rd May.   Another protest  was sent from  Tiflis, but the Turco-German commandermaintained that Turkey must protect her positions at  Kars and Erivan, where attempts had been made to disarm peaceful Turkish guards,  and where  English  troops were operating with the connivance of the Tiflis Government.   The Turks were obliged  to defend themselves, and severe measures would be taken if the population were unquiet. The Tiflis Government protested again ; it  also instructed its peace envoys to declareits peaceable intentions  and to disown  any agreement with  any Power unfriendly  to Turkey.  In reply to this, the president of the Turkish delegation  said that his Govern- ment had been  informed  that British troops and  the Tiflis  Armenian Regiment hadtogether attacked and  driven back the Turks near Julfa;  he was  therefore unable  to continue the conference.                                    TURKEY.     Exchange of Prisoners of War.- Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 5th June [No. 893] saying that he had learnt that the Grand Vizier had said  that the departure of the British prisoners of war would commence  very  shortly and  that the execution of the agreement had been delayed by misunderstanding.  This information came from  Rechid Bey, who,  when in  Constantinople, had Discussion&amp;sed the matter with.Talaat     &quot;The  Wolf and  the  Lamb&quot; A  Modern Version. An  agent  reports that atelegram was recently  sent  to Selim Fuad, Turkish Minister in Berne, by the Sublime
Porte,  relating to the Armenian massacres.  The telegram &quot;recalled&apos;&apos; the atrocitiesperpetrated by the Armenians on defenceless women, children, and old men; and wenton to say that, relying on the  English  coming to their assistance,  they were  againplundering Moslem villages and massacring their inhabitants.  There  had been untruenotices of these events in the press.;  and it must be made clear that military assistancehad only been rendered to Moslems to enable them to suppress  Armenian brigandage,and that the Armenians must be held responsible for whatever happened !     Sir H. Rumbold also telegraphed [No. 867] in regard to this matter, saying that hehad been informed by the military  attache that the Turkish  Government had tele-graphed to its Minister in Bertie saying that it  had been  obliged to  send troops  toprotect the Moslem inhabitants of Russian Armenia, who were being slaughtered likesheep by the Armenians.                                   PALESTINE.     Syrian Arab Delegation.-In a telegram [No.  10838 B] sent on the 7th  June,General Clayton said that the visit of the Syrian Arab delegation from  Egypt had hada tranquillizing effect on the  population,  Christian and Moslem alike.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Peace Proposals from Turkey. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 10th June[No. 927] that he had been informed by King Hussein that Sherif Feisal had beenvisited by a messenger from the commander of the 4th  Turkish army, who had comefrom Maan under the protection of a white flag.  The letter  he  bore  was to the effectthat the writer had  been  instructed to  communicate with  the Arabs, accepting theirjust demands.  King Hussein had instructed Feisal to reply  that, between him and the,Turks the sword  was the sole arbiter, the answer which had  been  given, on a previous occasion to like overtures.KOWEIT.     The  Shaykh. The political officer  at  Baghdad telegraphed on the 4th June thaton the 3rd May the Shaykh  of Koweit  had, in a message to  the political agent at that place, promised  hearty co-operation in  the future, and  asked that the past might  be overlooked.  On the following day he called in person at  the  agency, and left a letter inwhich be begged for  the extension to himself of our friendship with  his predecessors.He  promised to  eject every enemy to  the British Government and to prevent  goodsgoing,to the enemy ; for the prevention of goods passing to the enemy, as for everythingelse which happened within his  territory, he would be personally responsible.     The  political agent at Koweit recommended that the reply to the Shaykh should hold him personally responsible for the maintenance of friendly relations, and intimate-that  should he fail in bis undertaking  we should  withdraw our recognition and requirehis withdrawal from Koweit; at the same time our intention to maintain the independ-ance of his territory should be reaffirmed.     The Blockade. The Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Yiceroy on the30th May asking for his views in regard to a recommendation of the  War Office thatthe reasonable personal demands of  Ibn  Saud and the Shaykh of Koweit should be met,but  that other imports from  India should only be allowed by a special permit from thepolitical agent at Koweit.     In regard to this, the political officer at Baghdad telegraphed on the 3rd June thatthe &quot;proposed  scheme would excite almost as much resentment as did the  blockade, andif it were introduced  it was - improbable that it would be effective.  Limitation ofimports by permit at Koweit would  only mean increased traffic at other ports, such asBahrein.     On  the following day the political officer at Baghdad transmitted a telegram, datedthe 2nd June, from  the political agent   at Koweit,  suggesting  that  it might be well to accept the Shaykh&apos;s overtures of  the  3rd May [see above] : the necessity for a strictblockade would to a great extent cease  if Ibn Rashid came in.  To this, the Baghdadofficial said that  he had replied  that the  Shaykh might be informed that his letter was receiving friendly consideration, but that he did not anticipate Ibn Rashid coming inat present.
     On  the same day,  the  3rd June, the political  agent at Koweit telegraphed toBaghdad saying  that  he had  communicated the message, and that the Shaykh  had expressed  much  pleasure  thereat.   For -the time,  therefore,  the local tension  wasrelaxed.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     Nejef [E.R. LXVI, p.  5, and  LXVIJ, p. 5].-The political  officer at  Baghdadtelegraphed on the 4th  June that the  findings of the court which had tried the Nejefrebels and murderers had  been submitted to  the general officer commanding-in-chieffor confirmation, with  the  result that seven&apos; had been sentenced to transportation,three  to deportation, and  eleven  to  death;  the last lot &quot;had been executed on the30th  May at Kufa.  Seyyicl Muhamad Kazim Yazdi had expressed his gratitude tothe Government  through the political officer, whom  he  received with cordiality afterthe executions.   On the same day the political officer was present (in the house of theKiliddar  of Nejef) at a representative meeting  of the ulema and notables  of Nejef,together with  the shaykhs  of the district.   All present expressed their thanks forthe energy with which  steps  were taken  for the suppression of the rebels  and therestoration  of  tranquillity to  the sacred  and ancient town, and, as a recognition oftheir satisfaction with the policy of the commander-in-chief and of the action of hislocal  representatives, a  valuable sword of  honour was presented  to  Captain Balfour.The political officer  added that this must be regarded  as  an event of high political significance,  coming as  it  did immediately  after the  execution  of  the leaders ofthe revolt.                                     PERSIA.     The Situation in Fars. Sir C. Marling on the 4th June [No. 500] transmitted a message from, the consul at Shiraz, who said that in  a  telegram sent to the  PersianGovernment, and in letters to Kawam and Farman  Farina,  Soulet had  asserted  thataggression could  not be charged against the Kashgais.  He obeyed the governor-generaleven when we had struck at  the Darashuris, and went to Khaneh Khabis to prevent histribes getting out of hand ; but, when there, he  was again  attacked by Indian troops.He undertook  to give the Persian Government a satisfactory assurance that he would keep his tribes in order and  maintain the safety  of the roads passing through histerritory, if on the other  hand he were given a satisfactory&apos; assurance  that  for thefuture the tribes, now gathered together to defend their honour and themselves, shouldnot  be  interfered with  in any way  by either the South Persian-Rifles or the  British.He knew that reinforcements were  coining up, but said that he was ready to fight to afinish; provided,  however, that we  made no hostile movement,  he  would  keep histribesmen quiet  till an  answer arrived from the Persian  Government.  In anothertelegram [No. 501] of the same date, Sir C. Marling said that he did not think that thesituation would be met by negotiations on these lines.     Sir  C, Marling, on the  6th  June, transmitted [No.  510] a message from Sir P.Sykes to the elTect that  the  situation was much^the  same ; it was difficult  to foreseeevents, but Soulefs tribe was truculent.  Soulet himself was disappointed that Shiraz,Ninz, and Abadeh remained quiet, as he had expected simultaneous outbreaks in them.     -On  the following day he transmitted [No.  516]  a telegram  despatched by the consul at Shiraz on the  6th.  The  consul said that the  withdrawal of the outposts,immediately outside the  town, had had a very bad effect on public opinion, and he hopedthat they would be re-established.   Placards were appearing in the town calling on thepeople to join in turning out the cursed English, sons of burnt  fathers; but it was quite probable that nothing  would occur.   As  Kawam was  not  satisfied  as to our intention to deal adequately  with Soulet,  he was  again wavering.  The  Governor-General had already collected supplies in Arassi, and in case  of necessity he would  shuthimself  up in that place ; he was watching the situation very carefully.      The Viceroy on the  Situation. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 6th June  that the trouble  was not likely  to  fizzle out  like other tribal  ebullitions, for Soulefs rising appeared to be a definite expression of a general nationalist resentment at our inter - ference  in Central Persia, and that made the situation the more serious.  The trouble seemed  likely to spread  to the Bakhtiari and other large  tribes.  He asked whether it would not be  possible  to effect a settlement of the whole  situation from Bushire  toShiraz on peaceful lines through the Persian Government; this would, of course, involve- the giving up of the South Persian Rifles,  but the original reason for their inception had.
ceased with the collapse of Russia.  As  a matter of fact, our only vital  interest in persia lay in the East and in  the North-West; by relaxing our hold on Central and southern Persia we should lose nothing.     The  Bakhtiari. Sir  C. Marling  telegraphed on the 7th June [No.  515] that,though he could not point to anything  very definite, conversations he had  had with theBakhtiari suggested uneasiness on the past of  the  less well-disposed, which  could  onlybe explained on the hypothesis that they anticipated that the situation in the Southmight involve us in operations which would dangerously resemble occupation.   sir c. Marling said that he himself was seriously occupied with this prospect and the effectit might have on the Persian mind.     Telegraphing  again on the 8th [No. 525], Sir C. Marling said that he  had receiveda message from Sirdar Mohtasham, a Bakhtiari.  The message was to the effect that he intended to pick a quarrel with the Cossack detachment at Ispahan, of which he had recently been appointed governor ; he described  them as our troops, and  said  that hemeant to  drive them out.   He said too that the whole tribe would help him, and  thatthe Ilkhani and the Ilbegi would be powerless.   He added  that they intended to attack the oil-fields.     Sirdar Jang had assured Sir C- Marling that the tribe  would never turn against us,and  that Mohtashanfs bluster  should not  be taken seriously;  what he really wantedwas  to get rid of the  Cossacks, whom  he  looked upon as  a force  of the  Zil-es-Sultanfamily.   He agreed that the threat against the oil-fields was childish, having regard toour  forces in Mesopotamia.   In spite  of  Sirdar  Jang, whom  he thought sincere, thesituation, Sir C. Marling said,  was disquieting;  but he should be better able to judgeits gravity after discussing  it  with samsam--es-Sultaneh, as he proposed to do. oh  the morrow.     On the 10th June Sir C. Marling telegraphed again [No. 529]  saying  that he was inclined to think that Mohtasham only had in view  the getting rid of  the Cossackswhose disappearance  would, he thought,  permanently  secure  Ispahan  for  the khans.This  was the result  of a  long conversation  with Jang and samsam--es-Sultaneh, whopromised that all incidents regarding the Cossacks  should be referred to the consul byMohtasham,  who  would  adopt a  friendly  attitude towards  Akbar  Mirza.   Thesepromises were to be renewed by Mohtasham in person.     Tabriz. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 4th June [No. 502] that  the FrenchSisters of Charity had refused to leave, and their having done so made it difficult for theFrench consul to go.  The other allied colonies had  decided  to stay so long as the british consul remained in the place. There might not be another chance for them to get away,as transport was very scarce ; consequently, he had given instructions that they shouldbe informed that no undertaking could be  given for the provision of transport at a later date, and that they remained in Tabriz at  their own risk.     Telegraphing  again on the 8th [No. 523], he said that, on  account of  the approach of the Turks, the  consuls  had  decided  that the time had come for all to leave Tabriz,wrhich they intended to do on the 10th.  He was expressing his approval of  this step.     Vossugh-ed-Dowleh.   Sir  C. Marling- telegraphed on the 8th June [No. 522] that itwas  intended to close the bazaars  [see E.R.  LXXI,  p. 2]  for  the purpose  of bringing pressure to bear on the Shah to accept Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, who seemed to be confidentof success.     Telegraphing  again on the following daAT [No.  527], he said  that, in  order  that matters  might be delayed  pending the progress, of the German  thrust  in the West,pressure was being brought to bear on the Shah by a strong party at Court to preventthe  formation of a Cabinet  so long as  the issue was doubtful. Sir C. Marling addedthat he was  inclined  to think that some of the supporters  of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh wereinfluenced by the same consideration.     Farman Farma.  Sir C. Marling  telegraphed on the 6th June [No. 512] that itwas  evident that Farman Farma was anxious  about the future in consequence of recent developments; and he, Sir C.  Marling,  asked  that his  proposals in  regard to Farman[E.R. LXVII, p. 6 ;  LXVI1T,  p. 5] should be favourably considered.     Farman Farma bad  urged on the consul that a well-managed and peaceful Persia,entirely controlled by us, would he ensured if he were made prince  of Southern Persia,practically independent though tributary  to the Shah; he had, too, asked whether wewould guarantee this  in writing, to take effect on a successful issue to the  war.       [898-99]             &quot;                                             C
    He was replying to the consul that he  was sure that His Majesty&apos;s government did not  contemplate  any  such  shameless duplicity,  but  that, if he &apos;thought  a  flatrefusal inadvisable, he might tell  Farman that he, Sir C. Marling, would;endeavour toget him appointed to  the desired  position  if such a  solution of the  Southern Persiaquestion should ever be forced upon us.    German Propaganda. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 6th June  [No. .511]that a communique from the German Legation in  Teheran had been published  in thelocal press to the effect that the Germans were  marching on Paris after having beatenthe allied armies and crossed the Marne.    Germany and the Oil-fields. Mr.  Wardrop  telegraphed from  Moscow on  the29th May [No. 36H, received the 19th June] that he had heard  that the question ofthe cession  to Germany of certain oil-fields in Southern Persia,  which had been inBritish hands since 1912, was raised  in  the  course of a  conversation between  CountMirbach and the Persian charge&apos; d&apos;affaires.  This came from a-good authority.                                AFGHANISTAN.    The Amir. The Viceroy of India telegraphed on the  5th June that the  envoyfrom Bokhara had been treated with marked respect ;  and, though the Amir showed no intention,  at present,  of intervening  for the purpose of helping Bokhara,  there  wasnot much doubt  as to  his sympathies  being with  it -a Moslem  State  striving for independence.    Recently, the Viceroy  said, the British agent in  Kabul had asked for an audiencewith the Amir that he might deliver a message from the Viceroy together with a copyof his Delhi speech, and a  translation thereof.  The agent, attended punctually  at theappointed place, but after  having been kept waiting for some time he was asked tosend the  papers to the Amir,  who  was  in  another palace.   Later the Amir tele-phoned that he had received the speech and message with much pleasure, and regretted that he could not see the agent.  He  also said that all was well,  and that  his longsilence need cause no apprehension; he would answer  the Viceroy&apos;s letter of the. 10thJanuary and this message very soon.  The Viceroy added  that he  did not think thatthe Amirs action, lacking as it had been in  courtesy, need be regarded with mistrustor as a ground of offence.   The Amir  was said to have again announced in Durbar thathe  meant to adhere to his  neutrality ; and it had been our consistent policy to believethat he meant to  do so.  The difficulties of his position were extraordinary, and it  had also been our policy to make every allowance  for them ; the Amir himself had  asked that we should not judge him by appearances.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                         GERMANY  AND THE EAST.     In a telegram from The Hague, published in &quot; The Daily Mail&quot; of the 12th June,Mr.  Charles Tower called attention to German preparation  of routes to the East.  Hesaid:  Germany&apos;s  through  routes to  the  East  via,  the  Caspian  Sea, leading to afghanistan and via Tiflis in the Caucasus, on the road to Persia, are being preparedstep by step.  The latest development is an effort to extend German control to the newrepublic of Georgia,  which has split from the Trans-Caucasian combination.   The newGeorgian Foreign Minister, Tchenkeli, has arrived in Berlin  to ask for a conference withthe  Germanic  Powers, which,  as now arranged,  will take  place in Constantinople.Tchenkeli was one  of the two best speakers of the Social Democratic Party in thefourth Duma.....   According to the  &quot;Vorwarts&quot; the  Georgians are  appealing toGermany with the object  of conserving  as far as possible the territories with Georgianand Armenian population  abandoned to  Turkey by the Brest-Litovsk treaty.                                    RUSSIA.     Martial  Laio in Moscow. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on, the 1st June [No. 247]that the Government was greatly excited and Moscow in a  state of siege.  A  counter-revolution plot in the city  had come to light, and numerous arrests had been made ; but
it  was not  known how  much had been discovered.   The city was  well policed andperfectly calm, but on all sides there were  rumours  of counter-revolution, and  theGovernment had  issued a wild appeal -to the  workmen to defend the revolution, anappeal based on class hatred.    Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed as follows on the  5th  June :  A counter-revolutionaryorganization, under the  title  &quot; League for the  Defence  of the  Fatherland and  ofLiberty,&quot; unites all the reactionary elements in Russia, from Minimalists to Monarchists.The Monarchists are in favour of union with Germany, which will restore the Monarchy,while the Left wing favours a return to the alliance with the Western Powers.  All are agreed to unite on a so-called national platform in  their common effort to overthrow thepower of the Soviets.  The  central figures  behind this plot are Generals Dovguet andSavinkoff.   The strategic plan  is to isolate  the Ural region from  Central Russia,thereby compelling the Soviets to capitulate owing to lack of supplies.   Cossack troops,together with  reactionary officers, are  holding themselves in readiness in  the  East.[The &quot;Times,&quot; 13th June, 1918.]    South-E&apos;astern Federation. Mr.  Lockhart telegraphed on the 1st June [No. 244]that a revolt agapast the Soviet Government had been raised by General  Krasnof in theSouth-Eastern Federation, which had in consequence suddenly assumed fresh importance.The  revolt  had  a strong pro-German  flavour,  and   the newly-formed government appeared to be on much die same lines as that now existing in Ukraina.   GeneralKrasnofs first order to his  troops was to the  effect  that the Austro-German army,yesterday inimical, had entered the territory of the Federation to fight the Red Guardsand restore order in alliance with its Government.  This was a sufficient indication ofthe policy on which he based  his hopes.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.    The Turkish Peace  Proposals  [p.  3].- -Mr. Balfour telegraphed  on  12th June[No. 760] to Sir R. Wingate instructing him to transmit the following message to the king of Hejaz.  His Majesty&apos;s Government is deeply impressed by the courage and resolutiondisplayed&apos;by the King oF Hejaz in rejecting the specious proposals of the agents of theCommittee of Union and Progress. His Majesty&apos;s Government is most gratified by thepromptness  with which the King of Hejaz communicated the  information in regard tothe enemy&apos;s diplomatic  manoeuvre, which  was  evidently prompted  by the effective action of the Arabian army  in  the field, on  whose continued success  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment takes this opportunity of congratulating its supreme leader.                                     PERSIA.    Situation in  Fars. On the  11th  June, Sir  C. Marling  transmitted [No. 531] atelegram from the consul at Shiraz in regard to Nawam,  who,  already  very  muchperturbed by the outlook, had received a letter from Soulet calling on him to declarehimself openly either as a  friend, of the English or as a friend of the National party.The governor-general had persuaded him to take up his residence  in  Ark, and therebyto show quite clearly that  he  was obedient to the orders of the  Persian Government.This should have a great effect on  the Kashgaris  and other tribes ;  it would certainly be a heavy blow to Soulet.APPENDIX.    Report on the establishment of an Assistant Political Officer at Hai Town and                              a Visit to QaVat Sikar.    At 7 A.M. on the 29th March I left Kut for Hai Town.   The flotilla accompanyingme consisted  of one gunboat, one steamer, and  two tugs; all the three latter towingmahaila.  The  escort to the assistant political officer, Hai,  consisting of one british officer and two platoons.    Ample water was found in the Shatt-al-Gharraf, and Hai Town was reached aboutnoon.    The ships were moored about 1\ miles above the town on the left bank and a campestablished there.                               .       .       i    In  the afternoon, in company with  the assistant  political officer, Hai,  Lieutenant
  Kirk, I visited the town and  saw Shaykh &apos;Abdullah-al-Mobammad Yasin.   Arrange-  ments were made for the cleaning of the serai, telegraph office, &amp;c, and a  police guard  was established there.      At&apos;8 A..M. on 30th the gunboat and a guard of  honour of Gurkhas on the steamer  moved down to Hai Town.           ,                                  &apos;\      A number of shaykhs and the leading men  of the  town were assembled at the  serai.   After I had said a few  words to them, the flag was hoisted over the ferai and I  held a majlis  and interviewed all the shaykhs and notables.      After  that  municipal arrangements  were  investigated  and  measures  for  the  sanitation, &amp;c, of the town discussed.      A Gurkha guard of fourteen men was established on  the  serai and the telegraph  office.      The remainder of the detachment remained in the camp above the town.      At first the military authorities concerned were in favour of the assistant political  officer living outside the town  in the camp, but I said that I considered, from a political  point of view, it  was  essential that the assistant political  officer should be located in  the town itself.   The  general officer commanding  the Tigris defences  has  now  dis-  approved of the detachment and guard being separated, and steps  are being taken for  the troops to move  to suitable accommodation in  the town.   On the  31st  March  I  proceeded on the gunboat down stream from Hai Town to Qafat Sikar ; the steamer and  one tug, each towing empty mahailahs, accompanied us.      Ample water was found all the way to Qafat Sikar.      The  distance of that place by water from  Hai is about equal to that from Kut to  Hai, i.e.,  35 miles.  The Shatt-al-Gharraf above Qafat Sikar is extremely tortuous, but  I am informed that from Qafat Sikar to Karradi and Shatrah its lower reaches are far  straighter than those above.      The  unsettled state which has always prevailed in the country below  Hai Town is  very apparent.  After leaving  the immediate vicinity of Hai, on each side of the river  begin to appear large mud forts in good repair with  three or four towers apiece.   Each  fort is surrounded by  a  village,  the size of the latter varying from thirty to 250 tents or  houses.  When it is understood that between Hai and QaFat Sikar over  100  of these.  forts and  villages are passed, it will be realised that the population of the lower Gharraf is  probably greater  per square mile than any other part of Mesopotamia.  In addition to  the villages attached to forts, numerous small encampments were visible.      The whole population of each of the villages was assembled on  the  bank  as!&quot;; the  boats passed, and when the gunboat which was leading came opposite them  the  men  all rose to their feet and in almost every case the shaykh  or headman salaamed.   No&apos;  armed men were seen between Hai and Qafat Sikar.     Suwaich, on  the  right bank, about 20 miles below  Hai  Town, is a  small town-  of about 1,()00 inhabitants, possessing a bazaar and a few brick houses.  QaVat Sikar.     On  arrival  at Qafat Sikar  we  were  met by Shaykh &apos;Ataiyah, who has been  officiating as Government Agentthere.  We had lunch with him, during which time about  100 tons barley previously bought there by the local purchase officer, Kut, was  loaded  on the mahailahs and  ships.     Qafat Sikar is a pleasant little place with some  good  date and fruit  gardens.  It  has two Turkish baths and a fairly large, well-stocked bazaar : the latter, however, is in.  a bad state of repair.     The  population  was friendly,  though less obviously  so than that  of Hai Town.  Shaykh Ataiyah has the outer  walls of the  town  prepared  for defence, loopholed, &amp;c,  as he has  feared raids by the tribes.  Shaykh  &apos;Ataiyah spoke  to me very strongly on.  the subject of the excellent prospects of the coming grain crop in Qafat Sikar, Karadi,  and Shatrah districts, and urged that we should take immediate measures to  get this  portion of the  country, under effective control.     The question of the construction of a motor road between Kut  and Hai Town  has  been submitted by the commandant of the Kut section to the I.G.C., and it is hoped that  this matter will be favourably  considered.   Ample Arab labour is available on  the spot  for the work, and I can absolutely guarantee the safety of convoys on the road.      The value of such a road, in removing from Hai Town the very large stocks of  grain and bhoosa which it is hoped to accumulate there, is apparent.      It is, I think, essential that every effort should be made  to  tap to  the  full  the  resources  of the lower and middle Hai.
