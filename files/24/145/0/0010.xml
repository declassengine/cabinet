APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT.  No.  LXX                                      RTTSSIA.     THE  Asiatic intelligence should be read with care.   The  prospects in Turkestanare now distinctly bad.  The destruction and disintegration of the Armenians proceedsapace and paves the way for Turko German dominion, extending through the Turanianbelt  right up to Afghanistan itself.  From  that  point of vantage the  Turko-germans will  work every possible form  of  anti-British policy; Pan-Islamism, Pan-Turanianism,and anarchistic revolution will be the three forces that they will use.     The elements which will  be friendly to us, and  which will combat  these threeforces,  are :          The natural  tendency which exists among pious Moslems to regard religion as           a spiritual rather than a political force, and which lies at the back of the           teachings  of Mohammed Abdu, Abdul Bahai, and the  Persian Mystics.     (6.)  The natural dislike of non-Turanian peoples for Turanian  ascendancy.     (c.)  The social elements which stand to gain  by justice and  order.     With regard to the development of these elements into  political assets, we can givepositive assistance in regard to ^6) and (c. ; in regard to (a), we can do nothing positive,hut on  the  negative side may do something by avoiding giving the impression that weare afraid of political Pan Islam  or are ready to compromise with it.                                    PALESTINE.    The political news is satisfactory.                                     PERSIA.    The situation is one which must give cause for anxiety.                                                                          M.  S.    May 30, 1918,r&amp;98- 97&apos;j:

In  his News  Summary of the  22nd  May, Mr.  Wardroptelegraphed from  Moscow [No.  336j that  on the  21st  MM.  Trotsky and Lenin had issued a notice to all Soviets in reference to the  decree of the  8th April ordering thecreation of local military boards as a first step towards efficient  defence against foreign and  internal enemies; they said  that  the  majority of the Soviets had been inactive  inthis  regard and  ordered that  the  decree&apos;  should be put into  execution  by them withina week.  Should this order not be obeyed  by any Soviet,  its president would be heldpersonally responsible for the failure.     The Fleets. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 18th May  [No. 192] that M. Trotskyhad  confirmed the news [ER. LXIX, p.  1] that the  greater part of the Black  Sea fleethad  escaped from  Sebastopoi,  and  that  he had given orders  for its  destruction if thisshould be necessary to prevent  its falling into German hands.  He also said that in caseof necessity  the Baltic  fleet would be destroyed;  special  men had been chosen forthe task.     Arrest of the Czech National Council. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 21st May[No.  198]  that the  extraordinary  commission  which  had  been appointed  for the suppression of the counter-revolution had, on  the previous  night, arrested the CzechNational Council; and he  had  been informed by  the Minister for  Foreign  Affairs,M.  Tchitcherin, that  the revolt of the Czech troops  at Cheliabinsk was the reason forthe arrest.   The Czech troops appeared to have quarrelled  with the Magyars in theRed Army,  and then to have taken  possession of Cheliabinsk after driving  out theSoviet.   As the dispute was apparently purely local,  and the Czech Council had alwaysrefused to take part in Russian  internal  affairs, Mr.  Lockhart had no  doubt as to the speedy liberation of the Council.   This forecast  proved  to  be  correct and on the 24th
 May  he telegraphed [No. 217]  that  he had  been informed  by M.  Trotsky ol  the liberation of tbe members of the Council,  with however the exception of one of the vice- presidents who was being held as  a guarantee for the disarming of the corps, on  which M. Trotsky insisted ; the reason for the disarmament appeared to be the trouble  which the Czechs had been causing in Siberia.      The Cadets. Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed on  the  17th May [No. 189] saying that pro-German sympathies had been  gaining ground in the Cadet party to a most dangerous extent during the past few weeks.  On the  12th May, however, at a  meeting of  the central  committee,  the  supporters  of  the allies  had won the  day and, with  three abstentions a resolution had beeu unanimously passed condemning any co-operation with Germany, and  expressing loyalty to the allies as the only hope of safety for Russia. Telegraphing  on the 20th May  [No.  3HI]  Mr. Wardrop said  that  it appeared that unanimity had only been attained by  the abstention of the  right wing, which he was told  was working,  under the guidance  of  Count Mirbach,  with  the  Octobrists and Monarchists generally.   A Cabinet was  already in course of formation, and provision was being made for a military dictatorship by the appointment of a Russian  general to take command in Moscow, and another  in Petrograd when  the necessity should  arise. THE  LETTS.     Provisional National  Council. -Mr.  Wardrop telegraphed  on  the 16th  May [No.  316] that  the department of external  affairs of the Lettish Provisional National Council had issued a memorandum, of which what follows was the substance.  Until the time when  the Lettish  Constituent Assembly should have been formed, the National Council, which dated from October last, was in the enjoyment of  supreme power ;  its function was the formation of an absolutely autonomous and independent State, by  the union of the  various districts occupied by the Letts, which State was to be  known  as Latvia ;  [? in the Council] with the exception of the extreme right and the extreme left, monarchists that is and communists, all  parties  were represented.  The  communists were excluded, because they aimed at an  international union, the  monarchists  because they  sought the union of Latvia with Germany. THE  CAUCASUS.     Peace Conference. Mr. Lockharf  telegraphed on the 24th  May [No. 213] that a peace conference between the Russian and Trans-Caucasian Governments would shortly be  held  at  Vladikavkas, thanks  to the  mediation  of Count  Mirbach,  the German Ambassador to the Bolshevik Government.  No good results for ourselves could be looked for from the Conference, as the Trans-Caucasian Government was Turkophil.     Germany  and  the  Georgians.-In  his News  Summary of the 24th  May [No. 343] Mr. Wardrop said that it had been reported in the &quot; Zarya Fossii &quot; that news had been received from the Commissary for Georgian Affairs to the effect that Germany was willing to restore Batum if the Georgians would  agree to the  passage of a German expedition against Mesopotamia. TURKESTAN.     German Intrigue. Telegraphing   on  the  24th May  Mr. Lockhart said  that  it seemed likely  that, in order to secure  a,  free hand for their machinations in South- East  Russia, the Germans intended to leave  Central Russia in peace.   They might, as the result of  skilful agitation, induce Turkestan  to declare its  independence ;  and in Turkestan there were large supplies of cotton, the town of  Krasnovodsk alone having, it was said, over a couple of million poods [1  pood- 36&quot;11 lbs. advr.].     In regard  to  this,  however,  the consul-general at Kashgar  telegraphed  to the Viceroy of India on the 5th May,  informing him that a committee had  been appointed by the Tashkend Council for the purchase and  transport to  Russia of  the Turkestan cotton.   The  Committee  was  being financed  by the  Bolshevik Government, and Russians in Kashgar thought that  the cotton was not wanted for the Germans, but for the Moscow  factories.                                    SERBIA.    The Government Crisis. -Sir C. des Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the 26th May[No. 66] that  it had been  decided  that  the members  of the Government,  with theexception of the Minister of  the Interior, should go to Salonika, that they might hold a
council under the presidency of the Crown Prince.  They proposed  to lay the position before him, and  if their view  did  not meet  with his  approval, they would  probablytender their resignations.   On the other hand, an emissary of the Crown Prince, whowas to have left Corfu on the 25th May, had  been entrusted, for delivery to his royal highness, with, a memorandum in which  the point of view of the Opposition was fullyset forth.  At the request,  however, of the Crown Prince, who was at the front, neitherthe members of the Government nor the  bearer of the memorandum had left the island,and it was not known whether the Government would  go to  Salonika  or  the crown prince go to Corfu.                                    TRIPOLI.    Turkish Activities.- Mr. Monahan telegraphed  from Tripoli on the 26th May thatthe landing at Syrta of Nuri Pasha  and a Turkish personage, whose name  was  not known, had been reported  to the Italian authorities as having taken place on or aboutthe 13th May.   It had also been reported to them that  much  war material had been landed at Misurata, and that a Turkish prince had, about the 18th May, landed at  thesame  place, where he was received with much honour.  These persons had  been conveyedby submarine.                                  PALESTINE.    Armenian Refugees. Sir R. Wingate  reported on  the  24th May  the continuedarrival from the East  of the Jordan of small  parties  of Armenian  refugees, for whomsuitable provision had been made.    Syrian-Arab Delegation from Egypt. Sir R.  Wingate also reported  that a Syrian-Arab  delegation from Egypt, which had  been  in  Palestine for ten  days-and  had net the  Zionist  Commission as well  as  Christian and Moslem notables, had helped  to allay  the  apprehension  of the Arab population in regard to the  aspirations of the zionists.  This  delegation, which arrived on the 12th  May, consisted  of  R,afik Bey-el-Azm,  Suleiman Bey Elias Nassif,  and Moukhtar Bey-el-Sulh ; it left for Egypt onthe 21st May.    The  Zionist  Commission. In  a  despatch dated the  19th  April,  Major  theHonourable William Ormsby-Gore, political officer in charge of the Zionist Commission,gave an account of the activities of that commission since its  arrival at Jaffa on the4th April.  In addition  to the visit  to  Jerusalem which has already been  reported[E.R. LXV p. 3], the  members  of the commission  had  visited the Jewish  agriculturalcolonies and the agricultural school.   Major Ormsby-Gore said that  it would be idle to deny  the existence of a good deal of mutual suspicion  on  the part of both Jews and arabs ;  the  former  were   afraid  of  Arab  fanaticism,  intrigue,  and  attempts  atdomination, the latter of expropriation.   It had  been  the business of the  commissionto  try  to disarm unreasonable fears  and  to  set  bounds  to  unreasonable hopes;particularly, during their  stay in Jerusalem, Dr. Weizmann  had  declared  that  theexpropriation of the Arabs  was the last tiling he desired.    General Clayton  telegraphed  on  the&apos;&quot; 26th May [P. 117]  that  on the 28thDr. Weizmann and Major  Ormsby-Gore were about to  visit  Sherif Feisal who was shortly going to Jedclah to see King Hussein  with whom he would be able to discusshis  meeting with Dr. Weizmanu.  This discussion of the situation with Sherif Feisalcould  do no- harm and might have  excellent results.   A sympathetic attitude on his part  and on  that of the King  would go  a  long  way towards bringing  about aco-ordination of policies.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.    Relations with Ibn  Saud. In regard to a  post which had been  established atWady Khurma by King  Hussein, Sir  R.  Wingate telegraphed on the  25th May[No. 865] that the  King had explained  that it  was  necessary for the pi-otection oftribesmen, properly subject to him, against the aggression of Ibn Saud.   He mentioned the Ateiba  by name,  and referred to &quot;other&quot; tribesmen, probably  the Sabai  and  the(?) Bugum.   The Sabai are at Khurma;  and, as they belong to the Hanbali sect, theyincline to Ibn Saud;  King Hussein  is  said  to  have encouraged the Bugum to actagainst them.  The King is said to  have been greatly influenced in  the  establishmentof this outpost against a Wahabite advance west, by an attempt of the Emir of Khurmato exact  &quot; Zakat.&quot;*  Sir R. Wingate suggested that Ibn Saud should be  asked to recall    *  A tax authorized by Moslem law on agricultural and movable property (Admiralty &quot; Handbook ofArabia,&quot; vol. i, p. 246).
any agents lie might have sent to the Khurma region, and to refrain from the forwardpolicy therein ; for his part, he had instructed Colonel Wilson to urge on King Husseinthe avoidance  of anything likely to cause friction with the ruler of Nejd.    Diplomatic Relations with Abyssinia.Siv R. Wingate telegraphed on- the  15thMay [No. 829] that lie iiad received a letter from King  Hussein informing him of hiswish to  appoint a diplomatic representative  in Abyssinia in  the  person  of SavedMohammad Sakkaf, then in Cairo, and in the event of his  being appointed, the King-asked that the British consul-general at Adis Abeba should help his  Hejazi colleaguewith his guidance and advice.   The  King&apos;s  instructions would be that  the Hejazrepresentative should (l) in co-operation with the  British Minister,  combat enemyinfluences, and (2) act as intermediary with the Government in connection with MoslemWakfs in Abyssinia  and pilgrimage matters.  Sir R. Wingate asked for instructions,but on the 25th May he telegraphed again I No.  866] transmitting a message from AdisAbeba to the effect that the proposed representative was llot popular  with, the Arabs,and would have less authority than  one sent direct from Mecca, more especially if bewere a mullah.JEBEL  SHAMMAR.    Flight of Ibn Rashid  [E.  R.  LXIX, p. 6.]-Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R.Wingate on the 25th May [No. 684] that  he v/as of one  mind  with  him  in thinking that, in case Ibn Rashid should evince any desire to come  to terms with us, we should keep our hands quite free.    The political officer at Baghdad  telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on  the  24th  May,saying that Mr. Philby was keeping  Ibn Saud informed in regard to  any developments in connection with fbn Rashid.   Mr. Philby had been told  that  we  were prepared toaccept genuine overtures and, in order to spare the susceptibilities of King Hussein, itwould  be better that such overtures should be made direct and  not through Ibn Saud.The danger of Ibn  iiashid embroiling Riad and Mecca would be minimised if Ibn  Saudwere kept in  close touch with  our policy; but Mr. Philby  had been warned of itspossibility.                                    PERSIA.    Situation in Fars [E. R. LXIX, p. 5]. -Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  24thMay !.No. 446] that some 2,000 Kashgai  had surrounded  the  fort of Khaueh  Zinian,which  had no  water supply and was held  by 70 South Persian Rifles with  one british officer.   There were probably another 6,000  Kashgais at Dashtarjin,  and the Dash-tistan jnen were said to  be joining Soulet,  who was preaching a Jehad.   The  consul atShiraz had reported that Kavam was perfectly sound; he  was able to  hold his Arabs,and a contingent of his own was being enlisted for the purpose  of guarding  Shiraz.Farman Farma was working for  us.    On the 25th May Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 458] a message from the consulat Shiraz, saying that Soulet was being opposed  by the  Indian force  in Shiraz, whichhad moved out against  him on  the 24th, precautions having  been  taken against anattack on the  town from without and against treachery.    On the 26th May Sir C. Marling transmitted  [No.  459] a  message from Sir PercySykes  reporting that during the whole  of the 25th  the Indian column  had foughtSoulet, who had a considerable force and  was well  supplied with  ammunition ; he had,too, some machine  guns.   Soulet had lost  heavily, his camp near Khaneh Khabis hadbeen shelled and the site occupied, and he had retired rapidly to the south-east.   TheKhaneh  Zinian  post had been  lost on  the morning  of  the  25th apparently by thetreachery of a. majority of the garrison, the loyal minority  fighting to the death.    Telegraphing  on the 26th  and  27th  May the  consul at Shiraz  said that the tribesmen  had disappeared  beyond   Khaneh Zinian and the column was returning toShiraz.  The Kashgais had  been heavily  defeated, but  were still very  dangerous, andKawam would be strongly tempted to join them if he thought them the winning side.The Indian column  however was strong and,  he believed, had plenty of food andammunition.   The governor-general was  not unduly depressed, and was working hard,on our behalf.    Enquiries made had s-emed  to  show that the  garrison  of Zinian had,  aftermurdering Captain Will and  Sergeant  Coomber, handed over  rifles and ammunition tothe enemy.   Such of the garrison as had come in  had been arrested, and, as the resultof preliminary enquiry, two Persian  officers  and  seven or  eight other  ranks were  to be tried by  court-martial.
    Attack on the Sinjabi. -Mr. Balfour telegraphed  on the 20th  May [No. 295] toSir C. Marling saving  that the Persian Minister  had stated in an official note thatBritish  forces,  having  joined the  Kalhor and  Guran  tribes against the Sinjabi, hadsuddenly attacked the latter, causing 400 casualties, the loss of 10 Krurs Tomans, andthe death of several hundreds  of women and children, who were drowned in the panic.He added that Sirdar Nasir, the Sinjabi chief, on going  to  British consulate at Ker-mansbah to lodge a  complaint,  had been arrested and would be sent to Bagdad.  the note had requested his  release and  had concluded with  a general protest.   Mr. Balfourasked for the,facts.    Sir C. Marling replied on the 23rd May [No. 441] that the assistant political officerat Kermanshah had provided the Kalhurs and Gurans with aeroplanes and light guns,and had arranged for the attack on the Sinjabi.  Sir  C. Marling understood that therehad been a good deal of loot.  The Sinjabi losses were 50 killed in addition to thoselost in the flight across the Zinkan river, some 200 in number.   The senior chief of theSinjabi,  Sirdar Nasir, going to  the consul at Kermanshah, had entered into  a writtenagreement to bring in Ali Akbar, whom the consul intended to  send to Baghdad.  AsSirdar Nasir failed to keep his promise, he had been deported. Sirdar Nasir, Ali Akbar, andtheir brother Suleiman formed  an  active centre of intrigue ; they  were  in  receipt  ofGerman arms and money.  The consul had  reported that he was taking steps to collectand protect those belonging to their tribe and to settle them down in their own country;he thought that on the whole  the tribe welcomed the breaking of the power  of thethree  chiefs.    South Persian Rifles. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on  the 26th May  [No. 460]saying that recent events in  Fars had, of course, greatly increased the  difficulties  inthe way of the recognition of the South Persian Rifles; and  in  a second telegram sentat the same time [No. 462] he said  that  he had received a memorandum from thePresident of the Council requesting the dissolution of the  corps as  the only way  ofcalming local temper.   Sir C. Marling said that he should act as he had  done beforeand send no reply.    The Shah and Vossugh-ed-Dowleh. -Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  26th May[No. 458] that Vossugh-ed-Dowleh was ready to take  office, but the  Shah had sent  a message to the effect that he would not appoint him unless we paid bim (the  Shah)20,000 tomans a month during Vossugh&apos;s  tenure of office and a pension  in  case  ofexile, though he would probably take 15,000 without  the promise of a pension..  Sir  C.Marling, who described this as  unblushing blackmail, had told the Shah that  we  wouldnot submit to it; but he asked  whether, in  case of absolute necessity, he might givethe 15,000 toman monthly subsidy.   &quot; In  reply, Mr. Balfour telegraphed on 28th May [No. 293]  instructing him to  do what he thought proper in regard  to subsidising the Shah.     Subsidy for Sirdar Zafar. On the 28th May Mr.  Balfour telegraphed  to Sir  C.Marling [No.  292]  approving  the proposals  he had made in his telegram  of the22nd April.  [E. R. LXVI, p.  5.]     The Turks in Tabriz.-On the 23rd May Sir C.  Marling transmitted [No. 443] a message sent on the previous  day by  the  consul at Tabriz reporting that  all officialTurks had left the town.  Before leaving, Baki Bey informed the governor-general thatthe use of the railway from  Julfa would be required by the  Turks for the transportof troops.   &apos;  The  Jangalis-On the  28th  May Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 294]  to Sir  C.Marling asking for  his views  in regard to the  Jangalis  whose movement,  he said,appeared  to be assuming serious proportions in East Persia.     Financing the Russian Legation. Mr.  Balfour  telegi-aphed to  Sir  C. Marling  onthe 27th  May [No. 28b] that a monthly advance (in  the first  instance for a period ofthree months) had been approved by the  treasury for  the financing of the Russianlegation in Teheran.  The amount advanced was not to exceed 17,000 krans.[898-97]C
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.     General Situation. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on  the  23rd May [No. 210] sayingthat, chiefly owing to the sudden alteration in German policy, during the last ten days the situation had undergone a  marked  change.  The  Germans  had expressed a desirefqr economic co-operation with the Bolshevik Government, and  had declared that theyhad,no intention of occupying Moscow or  Petrograd, their  military operations having&apos;been completed.  They were, consequently playing  again with  the  Bolsheviks  andputting up economic proposals of one kind and another.   As to the  position of  theBolsheviks, themselves, Mr. Lockhart  said&apos;that there seemed  to  him to be but little doubt.as to their: diminishing power, and this in spite of the fact that there was now more order in Russia than there had been at any time since  the revolution.     Black Sea Fleet. -Mr. Lockhart1 telegraphed \on  the 23rd  May [No. 204] saying.that the whole fleet had not escaped but only the  dreadnoughts  and the destroyers;the rest had fallen into German hands.  As to the ships which had escaped, the Germans.had declared that&apos;unless they returned to Sevastopol  they would take Novorosisk and:destroy them.   Two days later Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed [No.  220]  the  news thatM. Trotsky had sent a special messenger to Novorosisk with orders for the destructionof the fleet.   -i:. British in Odessa. Mr.. Wardrop telegraphed on the 25th  May [No.. .349]&apos; that)information had been received from Odessa, from the  Dutch  consul, that there had been no molestation of the British residents in that place or of their  property.THE CAUCASUS.  . , The Enemy at Alexandropol.-ThQ Indo-European Telegraph Company reportshaying, received  information to the effect that  the enemy was at Alexandropol on  the22nd May&apos;.                       .....        BULGARIA.   -  Proposed Change of Frontier. Sir W. Townley telegraphed  from  The Hague, onthe 28th May [No. 1940] that information had  been  received from an authentic sourcethat the Bulgarian and Turkish   Governments had, during the  recent visit of  theEmperor of Austria, expressed their readiness, subject to certain conditions, to adhere tothe general principles of the new  Austro-German alliance.  The conditions were thatthe frontiers of Bulgaria and  Hungary should be made coterminous by the addition toBulgaria of the Danube  district of Servia, the occupied parts of Macedonia, and  the;northern Dobrudja.  The  territory ceded  to that  Power by Turkey  during  the war would then be restored.                                    TRIPOLI.   j. Landing of a Turkish Prince. Mr. Monahan telegraphed on the 28th May [No. 7]that he had received confirmation of the report which he had  telegraphed on the 26th[p. 3].   One of the sons  of the Sultan of Turkey had landed at Misurata, accompaniedby six officers, some Turkish and some German.                                  PALESTINE.     Jewish Presentation  to  General  Allenby. General Clayton telegraphed on  the27th May [P. 114] that  on the 24th General Allenby had been presented with  a  scrollof the law  (Torah) in a silver case by Dr. Weizmann,  in the name of the PalestinianJews.  Speeches were, made by Dr. Weizmann and by representatives of the JerusalemSephardini and Ashkenazim Jews,  and the proceedings  were marked by loyalty  and enthusiasm.  General Clayton said that the demonstration had helped to create a sense of responsibility in the Jerusalem  Jews, and had enhanced the prestige and influence of dr. Weizmann.
                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Relations with Ibn Saud. On the 29th  May Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 702]to Sir R. Wingate instructing him to send a message, on his behalf, to Ibn Saud, asking him to recall any agents he might have sent to the Khurma region, and to refrain fromany forward policy therein.                                    PERSIA.     Forward Movement of the Turks. -On the 28th May Sir C. Marling transmitted[No. 470] a message from the consul at Tabriz to the effect that there were only four british subjects  besides himself in the town ; all others had left as  the Turks wereclose at. hand, and the Persians would obviously do nothing to oppose their further progress beyond  protesting.
