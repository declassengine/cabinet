Government by Soviet. The following is the translation of a wireless message from moscow (8th September) :-                    Memorandum for the Workmen and Peasants.     What we must remember :      1.  Soviet Authority has given land to the peasants and ousted the landowners outof their estates.     2.  Soviet  Authority has broken the power of  capital and has placed the factoriesat the disposal of the Labour State.     3.  Soviet  Authority has sent the  bourgeois out of their villas and mansions andhas placed them at the disposal of the workmen and their unions.     4.  All  that was left by  the bourgeois and estate owners Soviet Authority  hashanded over to the workmen and peasants.     5.  Soviet  Authority  has given the organisations  of the  labouring  classes  thepossibility of carrying  out work on a large  scale.   All the organisations have to do isto work.     6.  Soviet  Authority  was  only  able to attain this  because  it  was and is  theAuthority of the working masses, and that is why Soviet Authority is hated so intenselyby those who are striving for gold.     What we must do :      1.  To  destroy  our enemies,  both  internal and  external, who are giving  us nopeace.     2.  To take from them the coal, oil, and bread that they have stolen from us.     3.  To make a  clean sweep of all those profiteers who have wormed their way intothe ranks of the Soviet to spoil our labours.     4.  To enlist new comrades to  take part in our  common work from among  theworkmen and  peasants, so  that they will do their share, and will participate and help the Soviet Government.     5.  To train the workmen to regard  everything with the solicitous eyes of a master,for now the workman is the master in the country.     6.  To do all this with our own hands and thus crush hunger and disorganisation.     7.  To conquer everywhere.                                    ,*     The Harvest.- The following wireless message was sent  out trom Moscow on the3rd September  :      The  harvest in  the country has been satisfactory, but this is not enough.   Wemust endeavour to make arrangements,  so that this harvest will be as far as possible in       [845]                 ^                                             B
 the hands of the workmen&apos;s state.  The increase of fixed prices for grain, the issuing of a decree for compulsory  &quot;goods  exchange&quot; this  is  what we are introducing  in the villages at the beginning of the new grain campaign.  We have  undertaken a new and  ij not  inconsiderable duty towards the  peasantry, but the peasants must respond to  us in the same spirit.  If the Soviet Republic is provided with grain in sufficient quantities to feed the Red Army and to lessen the clutch of starvation from  the people, the towns of the future Soviet Republic will be safe.     We will calmly repulse the last attempt of our enemies  against our freedom, and the peasants&apos; land will remain for ever in  the possession of the peasants.     All the means of the Workmen&apos;s and Peasants&apos; Authority will be utilised to secure the delivery of grain and all  surplus supplies.   We have the full right  to deal with every fraudulent  concealer of grain supplies  in  the same  way as with  fraudulent concealers  of deserters.  We  will not stand  on  ceremony with  such  people.   The majority of the peasants realise that  the  Workmen&apos;s and  Peasants&apos;  Authorities, are defending their interests, and respond to such appeals readily without compulsion.  We will pay them well.  We will increase the fixed  prices, and when the workers in towns and factories will  produce the maximum amount of work we will send large batches  of cheap goods to the villages at non-profiteering  prices, taking  adequate measures so that these goods will fall into the hands of  honest peasants who have supplied  the starving country with grain, and not well-fed marauders.  With rascally wealthy peasants we will  be merciless.  We will  be able to  distinguish between those who are middle peasants, and whom our party is bound to  support, and  those who have wormed their way into the ranks of the workers.  We are going to fight hunger to the death in  the same way as our  revengeful enemies, and crush it as we have crushed  Kolchak  and repulsed Denikin.   The rich peasants who conceal grain need not  trust to their power, Kolchak was a more serious foe than they, and yet  he has been annihilated     Peace  with Esthonia. A German wireless report  (5th  September)  states that in consequence of the repeated defeats  on the Baltic front, the Russian Soviet Govern- ment has made peace overtures to the Esthonian Government on the basis of recognition of the independence of the Esthonian  State.     The evacuation of Kiev. A Moscow wireless report  of the  2nd  September gives the following details concerning the evacuation of Kiev by the Soviet troops :-      Denikin&apos;s  command despatched two picked regiments  of officers against Kiev. After two days&apos; fighting Denikins men  were defeated and  driven back  to Borispol.The  situation  to  the  west  of Kiev was satisfactory.   At the  same time Petluracommenced an advance against Fastov,  Byelaya Tserkov and Vasilkov.  The Red troopsstruck a hard blow at  Petlura and forced  him back to  Tripolye.  At the moment  ofthe greatest  pressure  in the fight  the  International Division retreated owing to  theloss  of their officers  and  political  commissaries,  and  also  owing  to  the counter-revolutionary  activities  of certain persons,  who circulated rumours among the menthat Kiev had  been  evacuated, on account  of which the International Division was forced to make its way through the enemy&apos;s close formation.  Petlura&apos;s troops, whohad already taken Svyatosbino and the  Volinsk outpost, advanced  through the breachthus  formed.   Our troops retreated  from  Kiev, fighting as they went.   The plan tosurround our men  was unsuccessful.  Reinforcements are being brought up  and fightingcontinues.  The evacuation  of Kiev  is  of no  strategical   importance,  though  itsoccupation  by  the Whites has  a certain  political significance.  According to rumoursas yet unconfirmed, fighting is already taking place between  Denikin&apos;s and Petlura&apos;smen for the possession  of Kiev.  The evacuation of Kiev by the Soviet troops will lead  to all those labourers left in  the  town,  and formerly uncertain on which side tofight,  definitely to  take up arms  against the  enemies of the Soviet  Government.The labouring masses  are suffering  the greatest brutalities  both from Petlura&apos;s andDenikin&apos;s men.     Black Sea Trade. His Majesty&apos;s representative  at Novorossick learns that tradeis now open with  all  the Black Sea ports, and has already begun on a large scale withOdessa.     Mr. Jerram urges the necessity of sending a consular representative to Odessa.     Bolshevism in the  North-West. The Deputy  Commissioner  at  Reval  has beeninformed by a Russian officer who has recently arrived there  that Bolshevik authority is waning in  the four North-West Provinces, and that anti-Bolshevik organisations aregaining many adherents.
         Military Situation in the East. A  telegram from the  British Mission in South     Russia states that, according to latest reports from Moscow, Trotzki&apos;s influence is waning ;W    there is complete chaos  in  military organisation, and risings everywhere from lack of     food.  Districts from which Kolchak has  been driven are  invaded by  desperate bands     from Central Russia.   They  are fighting the peasants for the grain, security for which     would have been ensured by Kolchak&apos;s regime.  This has caused another anti-Bolshevik     revulsion  there.     TURKESTAN.         Bolshevik Propaganda. On 5th September  General Malleson  telegraphed  that     the  Bolsheviks  intended to  start a propaganda  campaign  throughout Turkestan  on     21st September.  They were ordering the general mobilisation  of men between 20 and     24  years  of age  in  all districts except Tashkent and the  Steppe areas.  It was     proposed  to mobilise only Russians in the Steppe areas.         A Bolshevik Mahommedan  soviet  has been established  in  Kagen.    (General     Malleson, 1st September.)         The  Amir of Bokhara is said to be co-operating with Khiva in a defensive move-     ment against the Bolsheviks.         General  Malleson learns that  there  are three  Bolshevik societies existing  at     Samarkand (1) Persians,  (2) Caucasus Turks,  (3) Russians and Sarts.   Most of the     population profess Bolshevism, but the Persians are not wholehearted  in their support.     The Caucasus Turks  support Bolshevism  as a  means of furthering the cause  of  Pan-     Islamism.                                        GEORGIA.         Mr. Wardrop&apos;s reception. On the  30th August  Mr. Wardrop telegraphed  from     Tiflis the  following details of his reception by the Georgians :          My reception  by the Georgians has  been of a very cordial nature.  At  Batoum     yesterday I  was met  by  numerous  deputations,  official and  unofficial,  who  made     speeches of welcome.  Moslems and Christians were equally friendly.       .  I was provided with a  special  train  formerly reserved for the Emperor.   All the     stations were decorated with flags, and local traffic was suspended.         On arrival at Tiflis this morning I was  met by the Acting Prime Minister Gegech     Kori, Members of the  Government, Municipality, clergy, representatives of the learned     and artistic societies, foreign missions, and a very large crowd of people of all classes.         Guards of honour were provided by the British and Georgian military authorities.         Public buildings were illuminated in the evening ; the day was held as a holiday.         The  extraordinary reception accorded  to me  is due  to  the  fact of the  Georgians     being  aware  of the affection I have felt  for them during  the  last  thirty-two years.     They regard &quot;my appointment to this post as a sign that  His Majesty&apos;s Government is     inspired by most friendly feelings towards their  country and that a new era has begun     for Georgia.         .                   -  .                                        RUMANIA.         M. Bratiano on Rumanian Policy. -The following extract is made from an account     by Mr. A. Rattigan of a conversation with M. Bratiano :          &quot; M. Bratiano said that he did feel very strongly the  necessity for close  friendship     with Hungary.  I said no one could object to  this provided such friendship were not     aimed against any particular  State, e.g., Czecho-Slovakia  or  Serbia.    M. Bratiano said     he thought the  best way to  answer this was to  give  me  a short sketch of what; he     thought should be the future policy of Rumania.    The main  object was to establish as     close a &quot;union  as  possible between Rumania, Hungary, and Poland.  I interposed with     the remark  &apos; and Czecho-Slovakia and  Serbia.&apos;    M.  Bratiano  replied that he would     tell me   in  confidence  what M. Kramarz  had  said to  a friend of  his  at  Paris, but     he begged  me to  treat  this in entire confidence.  I said I would of course report  it     confidentially to my Government, to  which M. Bratiano made no objection.  M. Kramarz     bad, he said, stated that the policy of Czecho-Slovakia and Serbia must be to work for     the establishment of a close union between all  the Slav&apos; peoples, and he had warned     M. Bratiano&apos;s friend that Rumania had  better make up  her mind to be a satellite of     the Slav constellation and abandon Bessarabia  as  a proof of her  good intentions.     Rumamia was  therefore, in M. Bratiano&apos;s opinion, bound to take measures to protect     herself against Slav pressure by allying herself to Poland and Hungary, whose interests     lay  in resistance to the Slav idea.  I said  that this appeared to  me a, dangerous  idea.
The natural corollary of resistance to Pan-Slavism  for countries in the geographical position of Rumania, Hungary, and Poland would be German tutelage.  M. Bratiano-denied this.  He said that the three countries would, of course,  need a point  dappui,but  they  hoped  to  find  it  in  Great  Britain and France.    It would  only  bein  the  event  of  their  failing  to find the  necessary support  in  Great  Britainand  France  that  they would&apos; have  to look : elsewhere.&apos;   He  went  on  to  tell methat it ought to be realised in  Great  Britain and France&apos; that  the Russia  of thefuture would be,  if anything,  more  imperialistic  than the  Russia  of  the Czars.It was a sign of this imperialism that Russians talked not so much  of Moscow, Petrograd,.or Kiev, as of Constantinople.   We were bound, he said, to find  ourselves again in conflict with Russian imperialism  in Asia.  We ought, therefore, to be interested in theestablishment of a  strong  neutral European bloc  as a counterpoise to Pan-Slavism.I said that, speaking entirely for myself, I  thought it would be better not to give  sucha  bloc  an open anti-Slav character.   It might be  better to  combine  in  it certainsemi-Slav elements, such as Czecho-Slovakia and Serbia.  In any case, if the hopes basedon the League of Nations were realised, all this  talk of  alliances and understandingsbetween different groups of Powers was unnecessary.   M. Bratiano shook his head rathermournfully, and said he feared that the idea of effective control of the world by theLeague of Nations was too Utopian to find a place in practical  politics, and that thesmaller nations at least would have to take precautions of,this kind.&quot;                                    ARABIA.    Capture of  Colonel Jacobs&apos; Mission. Colonel Jacobs and his  mission have  been captured by the Quhrah tribe and are detained as prisoners at Bajil.   There appears tobe no immediate fear for their safety.  Imam&apos;s agent and  his escort, who were sent tomeet the British mission on its  way to Sanaa, have also been detained.    Following  upon the  departure of Colonel Jacobs from  Hodeidah, the tribesmenlaunched two attacks against the  town on the 29th  August  and the 2nd September.They were both repulsed.    Sir M. Cheetham enumerates the causes  of these hostilities as follows: (1) the prolonged maintenance of the blockade, which was primarily directed against the Turks,but from which the  Arabs have been the chief sufferers ;  (2) the hostility between theArabs of Tehama and Imam (the British  Government is suspected of  advancing thecause of Imam); (3) The religious differences between the Zeidi and Shafei sects, whichhave been exploited by anti-Imamic propaganda carried on both  by Idrisi and by theKing of the  Hejaz.    Instructions have been sent  to  the Political Resident at Aden  that no  militaryoperations are to be undertaken which are likely to compromise the  safety  of ColonelJacobs&apos; mission, and that Colonel  Jacobs be empowered  to  make such financial terms with the Arabs as may ensure his safety.                                     SYRIA.    Movement against Partition. Mr. Meinertzhagen (Cairo) learns that Emir Feisalis  enrolling  volunteers  for the purpose of defending the  country against partition.The movement  is intended by  Emir Feisal  to  strengthen the  Arab case  before theBritish Government.    In a previous telegram (2nd September)  Sir M. Cheetham stated that Emir Feisalhad threatened a religious war against both the British and the French.    Sir M. Cheetham telegraphs  that it would be impolitic to  make any reduction inthe subsidy to King Hussein  in view of the latteFs  excitement  over the Sykes-PicotAgreement.                                    PERSIA.    The New Agreement. -Sir  Percy Cox reports that in the provinces the first measurestowards  carrying out the Anglo-Persian Agreement are impatiently awaited.    In Teheran a small gang of irreconcilables have issued a leaflet which professes toemanate from the  students of  that  town.   The  leaflet, which has  been seized by thepolice, attacks the  Agreement  and summons  all  patriotic  Persians to demand  itscancellation.   In reply the Prime Minister has published  a communique  declaring thatthe Agreement had been welcomed by the  vast majority of the people both in the capital and in the provinces, and threatening to suppress all those who foment agitation against it.  As a result five of the principal non-clerical agitators  have been  arrested.
