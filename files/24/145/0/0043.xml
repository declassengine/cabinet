Bohhevih  Outrages in  the  Ural  Towns.- On the  14th  January  Mr.  Alstontransmitted I No. 53,&apos; a message sent on the previous day by the consul at Ekaterinburg.The Holsbeviks, he said, had  brutally murdered hundreds of innocent civilians in theUral towns.  Some had been found without noses ; others had had their eyes destroyed ;girls had been  ravished; and  officers who had been taken  prisoners had  had  theirshoulder  straps nailed to them.   At  Perm twenty-live  priests had  been  shot  andBishop Andronick buried alive.UKRAINA.     The attitude of the Russian Soviet Government On the 13th January the followingwireless message was sent by  M. Chicherin to M. Chekhovsy, minister for foreign affairs at Kieff:      In reply to a telegram of the  10th January [No. 507] the Russian Soviet Govern-ment again affirms, in the most definite form, its previous declaration that there are nodetachments of the Russian  Soviet Republic among the  troops  fighting against theDirectorium.  Your demand, framed in the form of an ultimatum, that we shall ceasehostilities against  the Directorium and withdraw Russian troops from Ukraina is there-fore quite irrelevant.     Your statement that you are attacked by Letts, Magyars, and Chinamen, enrolledthrough the use of the money of the Russian Soviet Government,isarepetitionol  a calumnywhich the imperialistic counter-revolutionary party is spreading with the object of com-promising the successful  revolutionary defence, which  Soviet Russia conducts  on all theWhite Guard fronts : and you surely  know that  among  the Ukrair.an Soviet troopsfighting against the Directorium there are no Letts, Magyars; or Chinamen.     As to v\hat elements are  fighting against the Directorium, you may judge from the1laot that  the peasants of the Kieff, Poltava, and Tchernigoff governments, who areimined with  the spirit of Bolshevism,  have risen  against the power of the hetman andol the Ge,man authorities.  They had already done so last summer, and they  fought for     [756]-49
months for the principles of the Soviet power.   The civil war which is now taking placein  Ukrnina was not causer! by any agents  of the  Russian Soviet-power, but is thenatural result of the internal  struggle which  is being conducted  in  Ukraina betweenthe. workers and the poorer peasants on the  one side and the Ukrainan bourgeoisie onthe other  side  ....   We indignantly protest against  your attempt, to  representthe urban  industrial proletariat of  Ukraina,  by  whose  work  the whole  Ukrainanindustry is conducted,  as  new-comers  who  are not fighting  for  their own politicaland economical  enfranchisement but on  behalf  of Russian  imperialism ....  the truth  being  that it  is  only the Soviet  form of power  which  opens the  way to  theindependence of  workers and  peasants, and c*-n secure  a  real national self-expressionfor the working people of Ukraina.   Your  attempt to  represent the civil war, now inprogress in Ukraina, as a war between Ukraina and the Russian Government, is refutedby.the fart that representatives and even members of your Government, recognising the increasing influence of the Ukrainan communist party  and the successes  of the  troops of the Ukrainan Soviet Government, have several  times expressed their willingness to  come to  an  agreement with  the communist  party and  to  include  some of its members in  the Government.    This clearly  shows that you  consider the  Ukrainancommunist partv as the real representatives of the Ukrainan workers and peasants.    We. must  also  protest against  your attempt  to represent  the Soviet  power ofUkraina as a. dictatorship on the part of an insignificant number of the urban proletariat.The&apos; Soviet power represents not  only the industrial proletariat, but also the whole ofthe toiling peasants.    . In view of  the willingness,  expressed  by the  Directorium, to  settle questions in dispute by  official  negotiations, we  proposed  that your  delegates should come to moscow.  In spite of the fact that in your last telegram instead of meeting our proposal,you threatened us with a declaration  of war, we maintain it with the object of avoidingcollisions between the Soviet power and Ukraina.  We consider  Moscow as  the mostsuitable place for the discussion ; it is a place from&apos;which your  delegates, enjoying  theusual rights of inviolability,  would be able to communicate directly with the Directorium.    On  the  same  day  the following  message  was also sent  out  from the wireless stations of the Russian Soviet Government:      The  counter-revolution,  the  position  of which  is  growing  more and  moreprecarious, is endeavouring  to  damage the  cause of the  revolution by spreading mostabsurd lies about it.  At the present moment it is disseminating the ridiculous rumourthat the armies of the Russian Soviet Republic are conducting military operations onUkrainan territory,  Another glaring lie  is that the Russian Soviet Republic has sentHungarian prisoners, Chinese, and Letts to fight against the Ukrainan  Government:there  is  not  a  word of truth  in this absurd story.  The  Hungarian  prisoners haveeither  gone  home  or are  on  the way  there, and  neither Chinese nor  Letts  are fighting in Ukraina.   The war, of which  Ukraina is the theatre, is a civil war.  ....Seeing the  danger in which  it stands,  the  counter revolution in Ukraina is endeavouringto damage the cause of  the revolution by  spreading  lies about it.   The Governmentof the Russian Soviet Republic declares that it is not carrying on any military operations in Ukraina and that not one of its armies is on Ukraiuan territory.SIBERIA.    Message for Admiral Koltchak. On the  15th  January Mr. Balfour  telegraphed[No. 39] to Sir Charles  Eliot,  through Mr.  Alston, instructing him to give AdmiralKoltcbak a message to the following  effect: * Control at Omsk having been assumed by your Excellency, the British Government wishes you  to  know that  every effort madefor the  establishment,  on the  solid  basis .of public confidence,  of a free RussianGovernment excites its warm sympathy.   The restoration  of  Russia to her  properplace  in regard  to  other  nations,  and her ability  to share fully in the . work -ofcivilization depend upon this.    Koltchak and D&apos;enikin.-On the 10th  January Mr. Alston telegraphed [No.  38],that he had been informed that the message from  Paris which he had reported on  the5th. January [E.R.-CII, p. 3]  was corrupt; a correction  had been received, from whichit appeared that Koltchak had  be?n definitely recognised  by Denikin.    On the following day he transmitted [No. 43] a message sent by the High Commis-sioner on the  10th.  Sir  Charles Eliot  reported  that Denikin had  recognised  the&quot; supreme authority&quot;  of Koltchak,  who  in  turn  had  accepted  suggestions made by
Denikin, to the effect  that  the ultimate form  of government in  Russia and Siberiashould be  left open for the present; and  further  that  they, Koltchak and  Denikin,should co-operate in military matters, ami that  the  struggle  against  the Bolsheviksshould be continued.   It was agreed that Russia and Siberia should be regarded as one and indivisible.    Altitude of the Population toicards the Allies. On the 11th  January  Mr. Alstontransmitted [No. 47] a message from the High Commissioner, who  said that  whilst-there was a difference of opinion in regard to the feeling of the population towards theAllies, there  could be no doubt  as to our  being less  popular  than  we were threemonths ago.                                    POLAND.    The General Situation.-On the  13th January Sir Horace Iiumbold transmitted&apos;[Nos. 8 6  and  87]  a   message sent  by Colonel  Wade  from Warsaw  on   the  4thJanuary.    Colonel Wade said that  after interviews with the chief of the general  staff andwith  General Pilsudsky the question of internal politics seemed to him  to be  a matterof minor interest in view of the  serious character of the  military  situation.  Some30,000  Ukrainians,  plentifully  supplied  with  guns  and ammunition, were  pressinghard  half that number of Poles on the Galician front.   At the same time the germans were  selling arms and ammunition to promiscuous  Bolsheviks, who, followed  them asthey evacuated  the territory east of the Brest-Lyck railway, whilst ou the other handthey  refused,  without  the  authorisation  of the  allies, to   allow Polish  troops  to cross  that railway, on  the ground that  so  doing would  be a breach  of the  armistice terms.                             &apos;   .&quot;&apos;    He  added that the military conditions  were such that, Poland being surroundedand  crushed, the last barrier  between western  Europe  and the Bolsheviks  would disappear unless  help arrived within the next five weeks.   Action could not be delayedtill the Polish Government had been recognised ; the  issues were  too  vital to permit of delay.    Martial Law in Warsaw. On the 13th January Sir  Horace Rumbold transmitted[No. 97] the following  message : A proclamation, signed by the  prime minister  anddated  the 6th  January,  announces  a state of  martial law  and tbe  institution of courts martial in the  town  and  district of Warsaw  for a period  of  three months inconsequence  of  &quot;Lost [? last]  attempt to  [? stir] up popular movement against theGovernment.&quot;    National Council. The same message went on to say that the German Poles had issued a proclamation  summoning a national council  from all parts of  Poland to meet at Warsaw on the 12th instant.                                    TURKEY.    The Capitulations [E.R. XCIX, p. 3, and C, p. 2.] On the 4th January  admiral calthorpe  reported [No. 34] great  anxiety on the  part  of  his  French  and Italiancolleagues  to  demand  the cancellation of  all measures  taken in consequence  of theabolition of the capitulations.                                                       .                                    MOROCCO.    German Activities a suggested Jehad.. Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphing fromMadrid on the  9th January [No. 21] reported that  he  had been informed that someTurkish &apos; officers  bound  for  Morocco were  on . board   the  German submarine  whichentered  Barcelona on. the  21st  November.   He  gathered  that these  officers  had landed on the Riff coast for.the  purpose of preparing Raisuli for a visit from Enver andTalaat, who proposed, under his auspices, to  organise a  holy war against the French, and perhaps  the Spanish,  authorities  from the  Riff districts, which so far had  been leftunoccupied by Spain.     Sir Arthur Hardinge&apos;s informant was Prince  Aziz Hassan, whose authority was a turkish officer, Takir by name, formerly in German pay :  he, Takir, had been  asked tojoin in the expedition,  but had declined he wished to return to Constantinople.
ARMENIA.     Armenians and  Kurds [E.R. CI, p.  41. On the 8th January Sir Mark  Sykes-reported [No.  67] that he had accompanied the British troops to Jerablus, and had thengone on to Arab-Punar.   At the latter place he  had joined Colonel Keeling and  meteighteen Kurdish chiefs, who had repeated all the arguments contained in the statementsigned by their six delegates.  Sir Mark said that  he had insisted on the presence  of a turkish police official at the interview.     TJrfa. On the 7th January Sir Mark Sykes reported  [No. 66] that an order had come from Constantinople for the restoration to their owners of the houses and churcheswhich had been seized ; as regarded the former, nothing had been done, and only onechurch, tHat belonging  to the  Protestant American mission, had been restored ;  in  fact,both churches and houses were being destroyed.  The mutessarif had recently threatened to kill the  Armenians to prevent their joining the new Armenian army.   This  reportcame from Colonel Keeling, who had just visited the place.                                     SYRIA.     Attitude  of Syrians in Egypt. On the 13th January Sir  Reginald Wingatereported.[No. 69] that  so far as he could judge the attitude of Syrians in Egypt, themajority of them desired a single government for Syria and Palestine under the tutelageof either England  or  the United States;  they  were distinctly opposed to  Frenchintervention.                                   PALESTINE.     Arab Propaganda. General Clayton telegraphed on the 10th January [No.  276]that active sheiifian propaganda  had  been  reported by   the  military governors  of&quot;Jerusalem, Acre, and Tiberias ; at the first-named  place much of the propaganda was done by  Arab soldiers, officers  and other ranks,  on leave, and it was hoped  that a compulsory registration of these would curtail it.                                    ARABIA.     Surrender  of Medina.- In two  messages [Nos.  68  and 71] sent on the 13th and14th January, Sir Reginald  Wingate reported that  Fakhry  Pasha,  the Turkish  com-mandant of Medina, had  surrendered at the Arab headquarters at sir Derwish on the10th January ;  and that  Emir Abdulla, representing  the king of Hejaz, had made his official entry  into the ciiy on the  13th January, and had immediately proceeded to thetomb  of  Mahomet, where he offered the midday prayer.   He was enthusiasticallyacclaimed by the notables and the civil population.     Message  from King  Hussein.  On  the  14th January  Sir  Reginald  Wingatetransmitted [No. 76,  the following message for His Majesty the  King :-Fakhry hassurrendered.  The Arabs, who owe everything to Great  Britaiu&apos;s favour, have  nowcompletely  achieved their full  independence, and  therefore I present  my  sincerefelicitations to your  Majesty, imploring God  to  bestow prosperity and his  blessingupon your Majesty.
