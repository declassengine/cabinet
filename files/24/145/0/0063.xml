The followingwireless message was sent from Vienna on the 30th  May :-     The secretariat  of the  West Ukrainam republic in a note addressed to the councilof four at Paris  protests against  the  invasion  of its  territory by  General HalleFsarmy, the statement made by Mr. Paderewski. on  this subject to the Polish diet, andthe brutalities committed by Polish troops on the territory of     The  note states  that  the  West  [Jkrainan   republicWestern Ukraina.was  proclaimed  on  the19th October, 1918, at Lemberg, a Ukrainan town situated in the midst of a purelyUkrainan population.  An administration was formed by the Ukrainan national council,and an army  raised from the Ukrainan soldiers  of the former Austrian army and theUkrainan legion, which has been defending  its country for seven months against thePoles  and the Bolsheviks.  The necessity  of  being  ready  to fight on two frontsprevented Western  Ukraina from resisting the  occupation of Ukrainan territories inthe Bukovina by the Rumanians.     Relying  on  tire declarations of  the  councd  of four  that the  decisions of  the paris  conference  would  be based  solely on the  just claims of all nations, includingUkraina, the  responsible officials of the Ukrainan state believed that they  could  acton the defensive against  the Poles while employing their best troops to aid  EasternUkraina against the Red army.  In  consequence Western Ukraina  became  the onlyobstacle to the union of the Russian Rod army with the Hungarian Bolsheviks, becausefor  seven months the West Ukraina troops  alone  defended  the frontiers of what wasformerly Eastern Galicia  against the Red army which was not able to invade a singlepoint  of the frontier.  On  the  other hand the Poles, as Mr. Paderewski had rightlystated, in  their struggle against the Bolsheviks received  great  assistance from  theallies in the shape of money, food, goods, and especially munitions.     [The rest  of the message is badly jammed,   but appears  to  contain  a refusal ofMr.  Paderewskfs  proposal  that  what  was  formerly  Eastern  Galicia  should  be incorporated  in  the  Polish state while  guaranteeing  antonomy to  the  Ukrainan[756]-696B
population, and appears  to propose to the council of four that the administration ofthe  territory claimed by  the  two parties should be  subject to the  control  of  thecommander  of the allied  troops  appointed  for  this  purpose.   The  same proposal ismade as regards the territories of the Bukovina inhabited by Ukrainans, but at present occupied by the Rumanians.]RUSSIAN  CENTRAL ASIA.     Tan-Islamic Propaganda. On the 27th May the army department of the indian government telegraphed  a resume of information received from General  Malleson inregard to Pan-Islamic propaganda.  The general said that this was making headway in russian  Central Asia, an appeal being made to Moslems on the ground that tbe Britishwere now scheming  wantonly to. destroy  and annex  Afghanistan, the  last remainingMoslem kingdom, which  was no longer required as a buffer state.                                     POLAND.     Message from the Peace  Conference. On  the  27th  May Mr.  Balfour  reported[No. 965]  that  the following  telegram was  being  despatched  that  day as from  thepresident of the peace conference to General Pilsudski, &quot;Warsaw : -     The council of the principal  allied and associated powers feel  that it is its duty to call  the attention of the government  of Poland  to facts which are giving it  thegreatest concern, and which  may lead to consequences for Poland which the council would deeply deplore.  The boundary between Poland and Ukraina is under considera-tion and is as yet undetermined,  and  the council has  more than  once informed  thePolish government that  it would regard any attempt  either  by  Poland or  by  theUkrainan  authorities  to determine it, or  to  prejudice its determination, by the use of force, as a violation of  the whole spirit and an arbitrary interference with the wholepurpose of the present conference of  peace, to which Poland, at least,  has consented toleave the decision of questions of this very sort.   The council has, therefore, more than once insisted that there should be  an armistice on the Ukrainan front, arranged in paris and under the advice of the council itself.   Full  conferences  in that matter have beenheld between a carefully selected inter-allied  commission and representatives of poland and Ukraina, and terms  of armistice drawn  up which have been formally approved bythe  council  of the principal  allied and associated powers.  The  representatives  ofUkraina have accepted those terms, but the Polish military authorities  while acquiescing in principle, have in effect  insisted upon such  conditions as would amount to a settle-ment of  the very questions in controversy and have continued to use  force to maintain their claims.  This has inevitably made  the impression on the minds of the  members ofthe council that the Polish authorities were, in effect, if  not in  purpose, denying andrejecting  the authority of  the  conference  of peace.  The council feels it  its duty,therefore, in the most friendly spirit, but  with the  most  solemn earnestness, to say tothe Polish authorities that, if they are not willing to accept the guidance and decisionsof the conference of peace in such  matters, the governments represented in the councilof the principal  allied and associated governments  will  not be justified in furnishingPoland any longer with supplies or assistance.  If it is her deliberate  purpose to set atnaught  the  counsel  proffered by the  conference,  its  authority can no longer, it isfeared, be made serviceable to her.   The council will, of course, insist  upon an absolutecessation of hostilities on the part of the Ukrainan military forces.     Polish advance into  Galicia. On the 29th  May Sir  Percy Wyndham  reported[No.  123]  that the  Polish  advance  in   Eastern Galicia  continued.   That  day&apos;scommunique had reported the occupation of Kalusz, Stanislawow, and  Ftalica in Galiciaand contact with the  Rumanian army through encounters near Rowno in Yoihynia.     Alleged Outrages on the Jews. On the 24th May Lord Curzon instructed [No. 109]Sir Percy Wyndham, his majesty&apos;s representative at Warsaw, to furnish a full reporton&apos; the  alleged outrages on  the  Jews by Polish troops in Poland and Lithuania, inregard to which many questions had been asked in parliament.  The  latest  of those questions had suggested  that outrages of this character had occurred in some 140 places,and inquiries were made as to whether the ringleaders had been  punished, and whetherthe Polish government was prepared to compensate the  relatives of the victims.   Ithad also been asked whether the Polish  general had prevented  a British  officer fromgoing to Pinsk to investigate a charge of massacre in the town.
     In reply  to  this  Sir Percy Wyndham  telegraphed  on the  27th May [No. 115]saying that Major Paris, whom he had already instructed  to visit the area in Eastern-Galicia recently occupied by the Poles, had reported on the 23rd May  from  Sambor :      Everything quiet there and in all other parts occupied by the Poles.   The popula-tion, including Jews and Ukrainans, stated that the Poles had behaved well since their arrival and had already restored order.   No  reprisals have been made by Poles.   AtDivesy the Jews and Ukrainans have been given representations  on the, town council.     Sir Percy added  that Major Paris  was  accompanied by three other officers,  twoAmerican and one French, who had reported on similar lines.     Telegraphing on the 1st June [No.  70] Sir Percy Wyndham transmitted a resume of a  report sent by telephone that morning  by the commissioner who had been sent bythe American minister to investigate alleged anti-Jewish outrages  in Czenstochowa.The  commissioner said that on the 27th Maya Polish soldier had  been  severely woundedby a shot  fired from a  house by some unknown person.   Some  hours later what was believed  to be this house was  entered and a young  Jew  found  therein was hurt.   Asailor who was [? formerly] in the German navy incited the crowd to  go to the Jewishquarter and two or three bouses were entered ; one person was killed and four others diedin hospital where also  eight other wounded persons were  taken.    The disturbancesappeared  to  have  been caused  by  the  high  prices  of food,  attributed  to  Jewishprofiteering, not  by religious  animosity.   The  prompt action of the authorities  hadpromptly restored authority.     On the following day Sir  Percy  Wyndham transmitted [No. 78] the text of theAmerican commissioners report.  In this  it was stated categorically that the  disturb-ances could not in any way be looked upon as religious persecution; also that the chiefrabbi and other representative  Jews agreed that  the authorities, both civil and military,had done everything possible to protect those attacked by the crowd and to re-establishorder.     Attitude  of General Pilsudski. On the 1st June [No. 71] Sir Percy Wyndham also reported  that the United States  minister had been sent  for by General Pilsudski  to talk  over the Jewish situation  with him.   The general spoke very strongly against thepersecution of the Jews, and said that he was determined to put  clown, anything of thekind.  Positive instructions had, he said, already been issued, for the  protection of theJews and  the maintenance of  order ; and now he was issuing orders  stating that the punishment of acts  against  the Jews would  be severe, and that officers would  be held responsible for the behaviour of their men.     The Duchy of Teschen. Telegraphing from Prague on  the  26th rM&quot;ay TNo. 1031,Mr. Gosling reported  that Mr. Paderewski had been there  on  the previous day andhad spent some hours  in conference with Mr.  Masaryk before proceeding to Paris.   Itwas settled between them that the Teschen question should be discussed by a commissionof eighteen, half of them Poles and half Czechs.                                  RUMANIA.     Rumania, Serbia, - and Transylvania.   On  the 22nd  May  Mr. Rattigan  reported[No. 301, received by bag on the 2nd June] that one of the principal Transylvanians,who  had been to see him, had stated that no real bitterness was felt as to Torontal, butthat he had  learnt from Paris that the frontier provisionally laid down by the councilof ten bad been altered by the council of four to the serious disadvantage of Rumania.It was now proposed to give Serbia the southern section of the Temesvar-Weisskirchenrailway, not because she had  any right or even expectation of it, but as an  induce-ment to  her  to give way to the uncompromising Italian claims on the Adriatic.   Suchan act would  create a violent outburst in Rumania and in Transylvania, and it would  beimpossible to answer for the consequences.     To this he, Mr. Rattigan, had replied in the same sense as he had done to Rumaniancomplaints as to the  peace treaty,  viz.,  that  it  should  be regarded  as an honestendeavour on the part of the powers to effect a just settlement of the world&apos;s troubles,and  that  it  must therefore be in the nature  of a compromise.  Everybody would haveto give up something  of what he considered his just rights, and it  would be better to concentrate ones thoughts on what one had gained than on that of which one fanciedone  had  been unjustly deprived.   Public  opinion  in  Bucharest was  undoubtedly
becoming very much excited, and there was danger of an anti-Serbian outburst.  But he anticipated nothing more serious  than a  little  rioting,  and thought there  was no-foundation for the Serbian apprehensions as to an  organised attack by Rumanian troops.     Note from Messrs. Chicherin  and Rakovski. The following wireless message was despatched from Petrograd on the 29th May :      Messrs. Chicherin and Rakovski  in  a note addressed to the minister for foreignaffairs, Bucharest, protest against the seizure by the Rumanian government, in Rumania,after the disappearance of the Rumanian front, and during its occupation of Bessarabia,of war material and other supplies  belonging to the Russian army.  Some of this, it isstated, was utilised by the Russian government for its own purposes, some was handedover to the White guards fighting  against the soviet power, and the rest was disposedof cheaply to  speculators.  Now that the  Rumanian  government sees the end of itsdomination in Bessarabia  approaching, it proposes before its retreat to lay waste thecountry, and its agents are robbing the peasants of their remaining provisions.  Whilereserving the right to bring before the revolutionary tribunal  the &quot;authors of  thesecrimes, the soviet governments of Russia and Ukraina disclaim all  responsibility for theultimate fate of the  securities belonging to the  Rumanian government and Rumanianbanks and owners, which were transported to Russia under the government of the Tsar,                                    TURKEY.     Protest against the Occupation of  Smyrna  On the 26th  May Admiral  Calthorpetelegraphed [No. L131] the  following summary of a memorandum&apos;received from the delegates of various  parties, namely, Peace and  Security, Entente  Liberale, NationalLiberal,  Turkish  Socialist,  Social  Democratic,  Trebizond  decentralisation, Ciliciacommittee, Thracian committee :      The  delegates note  with  pained surprise  that the correspondence relative tothe occupation of Smyrna  invokes article 7 of the armistice and the decision of the peaceconference.   Nothing has happened to justify the application of the former ; and thedecision of the conference cannot  be invoked because the Entente powers are bound to respect the clauses of the armistice until peace is signed.   The new situation grievouslyinfringes Ottoman rights, as these can only be altered by a fresh decision of the powers.The  delegates make the following declaration to the civilised world :      1. The occupation is  inadmissible,  because Greece was  not at war with Turkey.It is contrary to the armistice  and  to Mr. Wilsords principles.  The responsibility forconsequences must rest with the Entente powers.     2. Now  that the rights of the smallest nationalities are being looked  after, theTurkish nation, which has  preserved its sovereignty intact for centuries, and sees itsrights disregarded is ready for every sacrifice which will retain its unity and nationalexistence.     3. The Turks hope that the Entente statesmen who have established so many titlesto the  gratitude  of the  nations  will not  depart  from Mr. Wilsoifs principles : theyprotest against the  occupation of Smyrna, and request an alteration of this unjust stateof things, and claim the settlement of their destinies in the presence of  their pleni-potentiaries on the basis  of  the above  principles.   The delegates request that thismemorandum be telegraphed to the head of the British peace  delegation in Paris.     Great Britain loanted  as Mandatory. - Admiral Calthorpe reported on the 30th May[No. 1162 ] that the movement having for its object the inducing  of Great Britain to rescue Turkey by becoming its mandatory was becoming stronger.     Delegation to  the  Peace Conference. Telegraphing  on the 2nd and  3rd  June[Nos. 1186 and 1189], Admiral Calthorpe said that he had been informed by the french high commissioner that the supreme council had agreed to the despatch of a  Turkishdelegation to the peace conference&apos;;  and that the grand vizier had further informed him that he himself and Tewfik Pasha,  ex-grand vizier, would be the plenipotentiaries.     Occupation of  Aidin and Aivali,- On the 31st May Admiral Calthorpe transmitted[No.  1167]   the  following  message,  dated the  30th May, sent  from  Smyrna byMr.  Morgan :  The Greeks occupied  Aiclin on the 27th  May, without  incident, andAivali on  the 29th May ; the Turks retired from the latter place and desultory  firingoccurred with their rear-guard.   No bloodshed or pillage occurred in  the town.
    Admiral  Calthorpe  had  already telegraphed [No. 1166]  saying  that  he  hadreceived  a note  from  the  Porte stating that Greek  troops had  landed at Aivali.The Turkish government was  greatly surprised at having had no previous intimation..Local inhabitants, still under influence  of  the tragic events at Smyrna, had  come tothe aid of the detachments of troops on the spot  to defend their homes, and  collisionwith  the  Greek troops  ensued.   Grievous  bloodshed, could only  be stopped by thereiterated orders of the ministers or&apos;  the-interior and of war.    Informing me of this Admiral Calthorpe said  the Turkish government repudiatedall responsibility, which must be attributed to the disembarkation which had provokedit.  They stated that the piecemeal dismemberment  of  Turkish territory had brought the exasperation  of the  Turkish  people,  already over-excited, to the highest pitch,and added that, to avoid the consequences of  so regrettable a state of affairs, it wasnecessary  for the  great  powers  to  check  without delay  the  further  advance .ofthe- Greek troops,  pending a definite settlement of all  their  affairs  by  the  peaceconference.                                                                     ]    The Turks of Eudemish and the Greeks. On the 1st June  Admiral Calthorpereported [No.  &quot;! 175] that it was stated that the Turks of Eudemish  had  sent  a mixed commission to the Greek lines  to inform the Greeks that they would  resist their troopsadvancing; on Eudemish.    Greeks and Italians. On the 2nd June Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No. 1183]a message, dated the 1st June, from  Mr.  Morgan to the following effect :  On  that day he had been  informed  by the Greek  commander that he had received a telegram fromthe Greek officer  in occupation of the village  of Cherkesskeui  of the approach of an italian officer wdth fifty men.  The latter  officer  had  stated that he had been ordered to take possession  of Cherkesskeui, by force  if necessary,  on  the  ground that thecountry west of the railway belonged to Italy Cherkesskeui  is on  the railway to the.north-east of Sokia.  The Greek commander had, in consequence, informed the Italianofficer in  command of the Scala Nova  district  that, in  view of what had  occurred,Cherkesskeui was absolutely necessary for  the security of the, Greek railway; he would,however, agree to a joint occupation if the Italians wished to enter the place as friends and allies, and he  would withdraw his troops pending the decision  of  the Greek andItalian governments.                                     SYRIA.    The International Commission. On the 2nd June Mr. Balfour reported [No. 1002]that a message had been sent to Cairo [No. 48]  informing  General  Allenby  that theFrench had decided not to send their  commissioners till arrangements had been  madefor the relief of the British troops in Syria, by French, and that consequently the Frenchcommissioners would not go.   For obvious reasons it was  thought inexpedient to sendours in these circumstances.  The American representatives  had, however, evidentlystarted already, and General Allenby was authorized to state on their arrival  that thefullest weight would be given by the  British  government to any  advice  they mighttender to the council of the allied powers.                                     ARABIA.    Ibn Saud. On  the 31st May the  Foreign Office  communicated [No. 666]  toGeneral  Allenby a telegram  [P.  2891]  which&apos; had  been  sent  by the India Office toBaghdad.  The civil commissioner at that place was instructed to inform Ibn Saud thatif he did not immediately  withdraw  both from the Hejaz and the  Khurma district itwould be considered that  he  had definitely  adopted a hostile attitude towards theBritish government; in which event he would irrevocably forfeit all advantages securedunder the 1915 treaty, and his subsidy would be at once discontinued.                                     PERSIA.     The JangalL The following communique  has been issued by the War Office :      The Jangali are a tribe in the province of Gilan, in  north-west Persia [borderingthe Caspian],  and  inhabit  the thickly wooded country near the main road betweenKazvin and Enzeli.  Their forces, during the early phases of the war, had been trained.by German officers, and until  August 1918, their attitude towards us was hostile.       [756]-696     .                                                  C
     Then, however, abandoning all  hopes of receiving the long-promised support  ofGerman  and Turkish  troops, they  sought  to ingratiate themselves with us, and anagreement was  made  with them whereby it was hoped to secure  the safety of ourimportant line of communication between Kazvin and  the Caspian.   Under  the termsof this agri ement the Jangali. undertook not to send parties to the Kazvin-Enzeli roaclor to its  vicinity.     Relations between the  British military authorities and  the Jangali continuedfriendly, but Kucld [Kuchik] Khan,  the leaaer of the Jang-ali, adopted an increasinglyhostile attitude towards the Persian  government, taking over the control of governmentdepartments such as telegraphs.  Events proved at this time that Kuchi Khan aimed at making the  Gilan  province independent of Persia,  and that he  was working  incollusion with the Bolsheviks in Baku and the Caucasus.   Moreover, he had broken theterms of  our agreement with him by holding up  the traffic on the Kazvin-Enzeli road.     In December the offer of most reasonable  terms to K uchi  Khan by the Persiangovernment was  refused, and the Persians  asked for our co-operation in dealing withhim.   In view of our assurances  to  Persia it was decided to assist her, this assistancebeing  limited to co-operating  with their troops  to the  extent  of two  sections of an indian mountain battery, with  an adequate infantry escort  and aeroplanes, whilst ourarmoured cars and the garrisons of our posts kept open the Kazvin-Enzeli road.     Colonel Storresolsky, commandant of the Persian Cossack division, was in command,and  should Kuchi  Khan not surrender  on being called upon to do so, the plan  of operations was for columns to advance from  Ardebil in  the north, Resht in  the east,-and  Zinjam in the south against the Jangali strongholds of Kasha and Eumen.     Kuchi Khan refused to surrender, and the columns moving forward, early in April,captured Fumen on the 14th, and Kuchi Khan fled.   The Jangali were routed, andone German and two Bolshevik officers taken prisoners.   Further operations  consistedin hunting down fugitives, a ship with two  sections of Gurkhas  on board preventingtheir escape by sea.     Early in May Kuchi Khan had been driven  out, the  province of Gilan restored  tothe authority of the Persian  government, and the object of the operations  had beenfully accomplished.     Eliorasan. -  According to the Indian government telegram  of  the 27th   May, the pan-Islamic  propaganda  noted  above [p.  2] extends  to Khorasan, a  special  appealbeing made to the  Shiahs  by allegations of  British  outrages  and the  desecration  ofKeressea and Nejef.  The lower classes were, it had been reported, becoming-  inflamed,but the changes were not accepted by the higher class  Persians,  who were  generallyfriendly to us.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     General Situation. The following communiques have  been issued  by the IndiaOffice :-     (1.)  Owing  to General Nadir Khan having developed an offensive on  the 26th May,it has become necessary to withdraw the  garrisons of the small  advanced posts in theTochi valley [south-west of Peshawar], and this  has in turn necessitated the withdrawal and concentration of  the  garrisons  of the  advanced posts in the  Gomal valley.   a concentration of these small scattered garrisons on the  general line Thal-Idak-Murtazahas accordingly been carried out.     The abandonment of the small posts in  the  Tocht and Gomal valleys has resultedin Mahsud and Wazir lashkars joining the Afghan forces which occupied  the abandonedterritory.     The latest information received, dated Simla, the 28th  May, reports no change  inthe situation in the Khyber area  and to the northward, but  that  the main strength  ofthe Afghan forces in Khost  under General  Nadir Khan are operating  against Thai,which  was being shelled from the right bank of the Kurram river on the 27th May,large concentrations of the enemy being reported within three miles of the fort.     Reinforcements are being  despatched, to Kohat to deal with the situation in this area.  General Nadir Khan was  reported to  be endeavouring to get into touch withthe Orakzai and Zaimukat tribes, whose attitude,  however, remained satisfactory.     South of the  Peiwar Kotal [north  of  the  Kurram valley] Afghan mountain guns were in action on the 27th May.   An attempt to rush Chapri by Afghan tribesmen wasdriven back with some casualties.     From Baluchistan the capture by our forces of the  Afghan  Fort  Baldak, oppositeChaman  [the terminus of the railway from Quettaj on the 27th May has  been reported.
     During the air raid on Kabul on the 24th May bodies of troops, estimated at 5,000 to-6,000, were  observed, mostly moving westward, between  Gandamak (28 miles south-west of Jalalabad) andKabul.     A report from Kal&apos;at-i-Ghilzai speaks  of general talk  of a  Jehad after the  fast ofTtamazan.     A successful action  has been reported from Chitral [northern end of the frontier]where the Chitral&quot;scouts and the Mehtar&apos;s bodyguard attacked  the Afghans holdingthe line of the Bashgul stream  and gained all objectives,  capturing four  guns and a quantity of arms, ammunition,  and stores.  The enemy dead  were estimated at 250and our casualties are reported to be slight.     The Amir&apos;s  Letter. On the  2nd  June  the India  Office  issued  the  followingcommunique :      The viceroy reports that a  letter from  the amir, dated the 28th  May, has beenreceived in Peshawar, and gives a summary of  the lirst rough translation.   The amir,after a laboured explanation of his hostile acts, expresses  a desire for &quot; an honourablepeace, useful for both parties,&quot; and asks that negotiations may be opened at Lundi Kotalor Peshawar.     He assures the  viceroy, &quot; with the greatest sincerity,&quot;  that he &quot;never  intendedseverance of friendship,&quot;  and states  that he has  sent  instructions to the Afghancommanders  to stop  hostilities and the movements of troops.  Certified  copies of these instructions were enclosed in his letter.     Two days later  the India Office further announced that the  viceroy had  reportedthat he had replied to the letter, stating the terms on  which he was prepared  to conclude an armistice as a preliminary to the discussion of terms of peace.     In  the  course of his letter  the Viceroy gave a  reasoned statement of the  causesthat had led to the outbreak of hostilities ;  and of  the various acts of  unprovoked aggression committed  by the Afghans.  He made it plain that  explanations such  asthat given in the amir&apos;s orders  to  his commanders, to the effect that the &quot; Afghanswere obliged to take defensive measures,&quot; are wholly inadmissible ;  and that the Afghans&apos;incursion  had no  justification whatever  in  any action  on  the  part of the  british authorities.
