  APPRECIATION OE THE POLITICAL EFFECT OF RECENT OPERATIONS IN PALESTINE.     GENERAL ALLENBY&apos;S victory in Palestine is not referred to in this report, asthe direct political effects  have not  yet begun  to make themselves felt.  It would,however, perhaps be useful to take this opportunity of appreciating  here  and  now thechange which this locally decisive military action will have on the East.     1. Arabia. The removal of the Turks from North Palestine results in there being no longer a base for Turkish agents and German gold  to operate upon, the tribes, spreaddissensions, and work up fanatical  organisations such  as the Ikhwan  brotherhood.  Asa consequence,  all Arabian  tribal  politics  sink in  importance.  The quarrel  betweenIbn Saud and the King of the Hedjaz, or between Ibn Saud and Ibn Reshid, cannot end in the defection of any party, while the Arab movement must henceforth be centred onFeisal and his  northern army and  no longer on Mecca.  In the  Yemen  the  Turkishdisaster will undoubtedly react on the Imam, and the position of the Turkish forces inthat region will grow more precarious than hitherto.   In Hedjaz the position of Medinabecomes almost hopeless ;  although it may hold  on for a long time yet, its commandermust know that there is no prospect of its being relieved.     2. Mesopotamia. Now that Amman is held in Syria  there is every likelihood thatat least  camel  communication  will  be established  between Mesopotamia and  theMediterranean, and that caravan traffic and trading between Bagdad and the West willbe reopened.   The consequences of this, if developed, are  almost  incalculable, and  ifmotor and aerial services  follow upon the opening of caravan traffic, a great material and intellectual change will come over North  Arabia in a very few months  accompaniedby a new orientation in Mesopotamia.     3. North Syria and North Mesopotamia. The  effect  of  General  Allenby&apos;s victoryon the Arabic-speaking areas of Syria and North  Mesopotamia cannot be estimated.   Ifit be possible to  exploit the victory rapidly  to the  full, it may  well mean  the  dis-appearance of Turkish influence south of the Taurus.  If, on the other hand, the Turkshave time to  rest and foment quarrels among  the local populations, the situation maysubside as it did after the battle of Gaza.     4. Zionism.-The  Zionist  situation  is  now relieved.   The  whole of  ZionistPalestine is  evacuated.  The Zionists  need  now he under  no apprehension as to thesecurity of their colonies, and the Arabs, with  whom  there  was always the clanger of friction, have now a real goal and object to attract their attention  in Damascus.   Thuswe see one great difficulty  with which  our political  officers had to contend reduced tovery small proportions.     5. Palestine. The congestion at  Jerusalem, at &apos; which place  the administration had  to deal  with religious, political, racial, and other matters within 10  miles  of a.firing line, where there was an uncertain situation, is  now at  an an end.     The whole of the country east of the  Dead Sea is now clear of the Turks, andpasses permanently out of the theatre of operations.     6. Caucasus. In the  Caucasus General Allenby&apos;s victory will  have a considerable effect.  The  reason for this is not militarjr  but psychological.  As has  been already       [81&apos;8-114]APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT,  No. LXXXVII.
stated, the destruction of the Turkish Palestinian force imperils Turkish influence up tothe Taurus, which is the gate  of Anatolia.  Anatolia is to the  Ottoman  what  EastPrussians to the Hohenzollern.  Syria and Armenia are regarded as the main  defences.Once the Turks feel  that  .4 natolia itself is within reach of enemy action Pan-Turahianismand Pan-Islamism, and all the Turco-German Asiatic schemes of expansion,  will vanishfrom their minds, and they will be  in  no mental  condition to, pursue  their Easternobjectives with any enthusiasm.                                     - &apos;&apos;   &apos;,vr;/: .     This is. especially the case because Constantinople-Caucasus communications are by sea and not by land.   Therefore, from the Pasha to the  soldier, the  Caucasus is adistant foreign region, infinitely more remote from Konia, the real Turkish  home, thanSouth Syria.  The Turks in the Caucasus, when they hear of the action in  Palestine,will consequently feel that they are wasting their  energy abroad while the  enemy  isthreatening their  own  fireside.  In  these  circumstances it will be  difficult for theGermans to keep  the Turks up to  the mark in the more distant  fields.   All  this,however, is subject to the spread of disaffection  in Syria and  to the incapacity of theTurks to rally or build a new; army between  Aleppo and Damascus.     7. India, Afghanistan, Persia. The effect  of  the victory  in India, Afghanistan,and  Persia will be  considerable but gradual; pro-Turkism will wane  with Turkishdefeat.    - :     8. Turkey  Proper. It is difficult to venture any anticipation of the  effect inTurkey itself  The  C.U.P.  may consider that the moment is ripe to turn round on theGermans, invent a bogus revolution, label and  seal it with the assassination  of one ortwo  prominent but  dispensable  persons, and don  the  garments of  repentance.   Wemust beware of this move; it  will not  be  the  first revolution that the  C.U.P. hasorganised against itself in. order to  gain a lease  of life.   On  this occasion  the &apos;object would  doubtless be  to  qualify for  a position  at a Peace  Conference  with  offers of&quot; reforms.&quot;   At any rate, it is probable that we  shall obtain better treatment for our prisoners of war in Turkish  hands.                                      RUSSIA.     The husslan account of the occupation of Baku is to be noted.     The rest of this section of the report should  be read with care.  It does not permit of appreciation.            ..                        ALGERIA.                           .,,     The French reforms seem  very  modest.

Chicherin&apos;s terms for Exchange. On the 18th September the Bolshevik Govern-ment sent out. the following wireless message :      In spite of the discovered participation of  British and French diplomatic,  consular,and  military  agents  in the conspiracies  against the Councils&apos; Republic,  the RussianGovernment is  still ready to grant permission to  leave  Russia,  via Finland,  to all british diplomatic, consular, and  military agents, as well as to the  French  consularagents, and to the French military attache, at the moment when the  Russian Govern-ment receives a message  through the  Russian representative at London,  M. Litvinoff,from an English harbour,  informing  if  that  he  and  his  comrades, according to  alist approved  by him, are on board a steamer which is  leaving England with  themfor a foreign country.     At. the same time we must also receive a message from the local Norwegian consulwith the statement that  M. Litvinoff and his comrades  have left  England withouthindrance.  Moreover, the Swedish and  Norwegian  Governments,  together with  the danish and Dutch Governments,  which have also taken  part  in  the recent proceedingsof the Northern States, must at  the same time guarantee that M. Litvinoff and hiscomrades will be permitted to reach Russian territory  without hindrance.   Amongthe  companions of M. Litvinoff  must be included  M.  Baitler, our  representative  atChristiania, who was  arrested  by  the British  on  the  high  seas,  and  his secretary,M. Tompson.     The  French militar&apos; personnel will receive permission to leave Russia when wehave received definite proof that France will  fulfil  her  promise, and will permit allRussian soldiers, who wish it, to return  to Russia, and  to this end  we  request  thatpermission to  enter France be given to three delegates of  the International Red Cross,and  to three delegates of the Russiaii  Red Cross.     When we see that there is an  arrangement for  the  return of Russian  soldiers, and
that it is being carried out, then, in return, we will send home all  the French military&apos;:personnel in Russia.     The  internment of  the members  of the French  and  British  bourgeoisie (menbetween 15 and 48 years of age) will cease in return for the  cancelling  of all reprisals against the supporters of the councils&apos; authority on English and French  soil, as well asin the regions now in allied occupation.  The return home of  these persons from  russia will be  permitted  in  return  for  permission  to all Russian  citizens  to  leave  thecountries concerned, inclusive  of  those territories into which  the British  army  haspenetrated.     The  baggage  of M.  Litvinoff and  his companions must not be opened, and hismessages in code to.the Russian Government must be permitted.  He must  also havethe right to receive code messages, in  which the People&apos;s Commissariat for ForeignAffairs will communicate to him its own conditions, and  also  the  British conditions, aswell as all concessions which the Russian Government  has  made  in the course  of  thenegotiations as well as the facts concerning the  part played by  the northern  states in favour of the return  to their homes of citizens belonging  to England, France,  andRnssia.     In regard  to  this, on  the 20th  September, Mr. Balfour  informed the  Britishlegations in  Stockholm, Christiania, Copenhagen, and The Hague that  the following telegram  had been addressed by him direct to M.  Chieherin :      We have received your  wireless message of the 18th instant.     We consider that it provides a basis for the immediate exchange both of the official representatives  of the  two countries  and of British and Russians generally, and weare prepared to act forthwith on the suggestion which you make, provided it is clearly understood that the transaction is to be one of reciprocity.     We  are  accordingly sending, as soon as a ship  can be  provided, M. Litvinoff, his staff, and any other Russians on a list drawn up by him, including Baitler, to a  port ofembarkation for Norway.     We  will endeavour to arrange that a Norwegian  representative shall accompanyM. Litvinoff to the port of embarkation, from which the latter will send a telegramconfirming his departure.     A  similar  telegram  will be  sent by  the Norwegian representative to his Govern-ment from the port of embarkation.     M. Litvinoffs baggage under seal will not be examined.     We request you to make, simultaneously, immediate preparations for the departure of Mr. Lockhart and all other  British officials on a list drawn up by him ; and, whenM. LitvinofFs telegram  reaches  you confirming his  departure,  the train  conveyingMr. Lockhart and his party should leave Moscow  immediately for the Finnish frontier.     We  are  asking the Norwegian  and  Swedish  Governments to  guarantee  thedisembai-kation  in  Norway and a  safe-conduct  through   Norway  and Sweden forM. Litvinoff and the  other Russians with him  and their passage across the Russianfrontier, as soon as they shall  have received from their  representatives  at  Petrogradinformation that the  complete British party have passed the Finnish frontier.   the danish and Netherlands  Governments are also being asked to give their guarantees forthe exchange.     We  understand from your telegram  that the  French  consular  agents and  theFrench military attache will accompany Mr. Lockhart and his party.     After- the departure of  M.  Litvinoff and previous consultation with him, arrange-ments will be made for the repatriation of all other Russians in England who wish toreturn to Russia, provided that all remaining British subjects in Russia who may wishto return to this country are repatriated  in  the  same way and in the same condition as M, Litvinoff and his party.     We  request that, after the departure  of the British  officials from Russia,  theinterests of  such  British subjects  as  remain and wish to return to England shall beentrusted to  neutral  representatives at Moscow and Petrograd ; we on  our part will,after consultation with  M. Litvinoff, entrust the interests  of Russians  who  wish toreturn to Russia to the representative of a neutral Government in London.     Pending M. LitvinofPs departure,  all telegrams in cypher from him to his Govern-ment will be allowed without hindrance, as well  as all telegrams addressed to him byhis Government, provided similar treatment is granted to  Mr. Lockhart.     Further, M. Litvinoff and  all officials attached to him  having been  set at  liberty,we expect the  same treatment to  be given to Mr. Lockhart and all  British  officialswhether military, naval, or civilian.
     As soon as it is possible to make the arrangements for M. LitvinofFs journey, you will he informed of the actual date on which his ship is due to sail.     Mr. Balfour then instructed the recipients  of this telegram to  communicate the text to the Governments to which they we re. accredited, and to request them to instruct their  representatives at Moscow  to inform M.  Chicherin that  they were prepared to  guarantee the passage of. M.  litvinoff to  Russia.  He added  that His Majesty&apos;.-? Government expected that the neutral Governments would recognise that the fulfilment of their guarantee would necessarily be dependent  on the  fulfilment of the undenaking of M. Chicherin to repatriate  Mr. hockhart and  his  party immediately on receipt of M. Litvinoffs telegram from the port of embarkation.     Permission for  certain   British  Civilians   to  leave Russia. Mr.   Robertson telegraphed from The  Hague  on the  :23rd September [No.  331 Lj  that the  latest telegram from the Netherlands  representative in Petrograd was to the following effect : M. Chicherin has given permission for  British  civilians to leave Russia on condition that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government undertakes  to  cease  repressive  measures  against Bolshevik  adherents in the districts occupied by the British forces; male  British of 15 to 45 will, however, not benefit by this permission.     British and   French  Subjects  in  Moscow  and  elsewhere. Sir  Ralph  Paget, telegraphing on the 20th September [No. 27.65 j, said  that he bad received information from  the  same authoritative  source as  on   previous  occasious to  the  effect that Mr. Lockhart was kept in solitary confinement in the Kremlin.   He was not permitted to read or  write or occupy himself in any way.  The Bolsheviks were trying, by every means in  their  power to break his spirit, and  it  was  feared that,  on account  of his mental condition, he might disclose something damaging to  Great Britain.  In Moscow all Frenchmen over 48 years of age had been liberated.  Not one British subject, either in Moscow or  in. Petrograd, had  been set  free.  In  Saratow and Zaritzin several British and French had been  arrested,  amongst them consular officers.    Alleged Franco-British. Plot  at Vologda.- Sir  Ralph Paget  telegraphed  from Copenhagen on  the 24th September that he  had received  information from the same authoritative source as heretofore that an official telegram from Vologda had announced the discovery of a big conspiracy, which was said to have  originated  in the British.and French embassies.  According to the same telegram several French and British subjects had been shot for participating in it.    Telegraphing on  the 22nd September, Mr. Lindley-bad already reported [No. 196] that he had been informed that wholesale arrests  had been made in that place, and that about ten  officers were  being shot without trial daily.   His  informant was, he said, a reliable Russian who had just  reached Archangel from Vologda.    Message from Captain Hicks  on  the  Situation. On  the  21st  September Sir Mansfeldt Findlay transmitted  [No. 3369]  the following message  from Captain  Hicks, which he had received through a neutral intermediary :     In order to understand the present situation in Russia,one must notice that the policy of the soviet Government is dictated solely in  regard to the influence that its  action may have on the cause of Bolshevism.  The  attitude which gives promise  of the exten- sion of Bolshevism and of a general revolution is, in its opinion, the only one to be adopted, aud any question of good or bad faith is of no account.   On  this ground the soviet Government aims  at delaying the  exchange  of  M. Litvinoff and  the allied officials,   (Telegram is corrupt here.)  If it  could  retain  the allied  representatives in Moscow long enough, it would try them..and collect evidence calculated to show that they  had  worked, through  capitalists,  for  the destruction of democracy.  Captain Cromie&apos;s murder would thus be justified, and material created for world-wide propaganda. There, was  no doubt  that M. Chicherin,.with  a view to  this, would  prohibit private persons from leaving Russia, without compensation, quite  apart from the liberation of M. Litvinoff.  It was the unanimous opinion of all the allied representatives that once allied officials had left Russia it would  not be difficult to negotiate  the departure of private subjects and citizens, though it might weil  be necessary to liberate in exchange many, possibly all, of the prisoners taken by the allies in Northern Russia.  The general opinion was that the British  Government would do well not to insist on the immediate liberation of all the  allied citizens ;  such a demand  would entail  further delay and facilitate the Rnssian plans.  -
     The Bolshevik Leaders. Mr. Clive telegraphed from Stockholm on the  19th Sep-tember [No. 2725] that he had had a conversation  with  a Russian  general who  hadformerly been military attache in more than  one capital, and who  had just escapedfrom Russia.   Speaking of the Bolshevik leaders, he said that Lenin would like to put an end to further bloodshed and to restart his socialist campaign in Switzerland if that should be possible; he realised that the game was up.  Another of them, Bokharin [anew name], also realised  that the end was near, but, unlike Lenin, he was out  (whilstany power was left) for all the murders and  atrocities possible.  Trotsky, on the otherhand, realised nothing; he was a.wild and crazy terrorist pure and simple.NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Proposed Proclamation. Mr. Lindiey telegraphed on the 17th September [No. 175,received the  22nd  September]  that  the  allied representatives  had  been occupiedduring the two previous days in examining the various  orders  which the  government proposed to issue when they handed over the administration to the new governor-general.These orders seemed to meet the  case, and had the approval of General Poole. who wasdiscussing the  military   details  with  the  governor-general.   The  Government  had intended to issue them that day, but had decided to wait  for a few days to see  if theycould get  into  wireless  communication with Samara,  which  the  French Ambassadorbelieved to be possible.   The attitude of the Government  could best be illustrated bythe proclamation which they proposed to issue.  Of this the following is a translation : -     Citizens ! It is the  delay in the  advance  of  the allied  troops that  influences usabove other considerations in our  decision to resign.     The whole  of the Northern  Region which has  been freed from, the  Bolshevikauthor^ comes within the zone of military operations.     From the force of circumstances  the  supreme power within this region  must  rest with the military authorities ; in this  case those of foreign, though allied and friendlyPowers.   In such conditions  the Russian State authorities can  have  no real scope  forthe  exercise  of their  proper functions.  They are condemned to iuactivRy.   Onlysubordinate organs of the State can still carry on their  work.  This explains why thesupreme administration has thought fit to resign its power  in favour of the All-RussianGovernment and to appoint a governor-general as supreme representative of the RussianState authority.     Immediately on the  fall  of Bolsheviks here in  the North, the supreme adminis-tration of the Northern Region was formed.   This new organ of power,  composed ofrepresentatives of the various political parties, and for  the most part members of theConstituent assembly, had  for  its  principal aim  the regeneration and reunion ofRussia;  it regarded its authority as temporary,  to come to an end on the formation ofan All-Russian State Government.     This long-desired moment has now come ; members of the Constituent Assemblycollected in Samara form  an All-Russian democratic Government.  The supreme adminis-tration  of the Northern  Region considers  it to be  its duty  to  resign its  powers infavour of this All-Russian authority.     It is true that as yet there  is  no direct .communication  between the northern region and the newly constituted authority, but it is expected that wireless intercoursewith Samara will be established in the course of a few days.     Advancing  to the South and clearing the country of the  Germano-Russian Govern-meut, the administration calls all citizens of the region who have at heart the welfare ofRussia  to  help  with  their confidence  and  co-operation this governor-general whoseonerous duties comprise the government of the district,  working handdn-hand with and(group undecypherable),  the zemstvos (the  organs of self-government), and the  colossaltask of restoring, with the friendly assistance of our allies, our military strength withinthe boundaries of the Northern Region.     The  supreme administration  has taken  this  grave decision only  after  graveconsideration of the state of things within the Northern Region from all points of view,and of course in agreement with the accredited representatives of the allies of Russia.     This is sufficient to guarantee the  population against attempts at a restoration orreactionary conspiracies such as that of (?) the 6th September.  The  allied representa-tives who have agreed  to the appointment of a governOr-general, responsible to theAll-Russian Government, could  never  permit  any  infringement of  his, authority,:delegatedlas it is by the  All-Russian Government.  Moreover, that the  people them-selves would never permit any such attempt  was well shown by the unanimity which
 inspired them, in agreement with the allies, in putting an end to the recent conspiracy of (? the Bolsheviks).     Citizens  of the  North ! whatever your  class  or  station, workmen and peasants, merchants and business men, soldiers and officers, the supreme administration calls upon you to repose complete confidence in our allies who have  come to our aid, and to trust and support the governor-general whom the supreme administration has appointed.     The regeneration and reunion of our country have  begun.  One more effort and the troops marching from the North and the East will join hands; and  then will follow the reunion of all Russia.     Long live Russia, free, independent, and indivisible !  Long live the All-Russian Constituent Assembly and the new All-Russian Government !     Mr. Lindley added that he would telegraph  if and.  when  the proclamation was actually published, until which time no public reference should be made to it.     Requiem  for Captain  Cromie. On the 15th September Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 169 I that a requiem had been sung in the cathedral  that  morning for the soul of Captain  Cromie.  In the sermon, which was delivered  by the Porthiereus, the services rendered to Russia by Captain Cromie in the Baltic  and the circumstances of his death in Petrograd were recounted, and he was held  up to Russians as an example of bravery and devotion  to duty.   The church was  crowded,  and the reverent  and  sympathetic demeanour of the congregation was profoundly impressive. SIBERIA.    Martial Law in  Vladivostock [E.R,. LXXXVI,  p. 4]. Mr.  Alston telegraphed on the 22nd September [No. 77] that Colonel  Butenko was  enforcing martial law in the area of the fortress, it having been proclaimed to take effect as from the 16th September : in this he had the support of the allies.    Bolsheviks to be held as Hostages. In his telegram of the 22nd September [No. 77 ] Mr. Alston also said  that he had suggested to General Gaicla  that he should hold as hostages,  for  the safety of allies  detained in Russia,  all Bolsheviks  captured on the Siberian Railway.   The general had agreed to  this suggestion.    The Provisionul Government. On the 22nd September Mr. Alston  telegraphed [No. 78] that he understood that an agreement had been reached between the Omsk group and  General  Horvat, who would occupy an  important post in the cabinet under M. Vol[? og]otski, the leader of the group.  The Vladivostock group of the Provisional Government had resigned. THE CAUCASUS.    The Turks at Baku, In regard to the evacuation of Baku on the 14th September and its occupation by the Turks, the Russian Government sent out the following wireless message on the 21st  September : According to  information which has, been received from various sources, there  is no possible doubt that  the Turkish army has captured Baku.   In an  outrageous manner, and in violation of the  Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, the Turks have attacked one of the most important towns of the  Councils&apos; Republic. Eye-witnesses  of the capture  of Baku  describe  the  monstrous  scenes  which  were witnessed when these hordes entered the  towm robbing and killing the people.  Huge conflagrations and explosions within the town  and its  suburbs  added  to the horror of the spectacle.  The  destruction of treasure,  especially of oil,  is  colossal.   On the 14th September the working classes were  despairingly fighting  in the streets of Baku against  the invaders; on the  16th September wholesale  slaughter  was ,begun bythe Turks.                                   ALGERIA.    Reconstitution of the Native &quot; Assemblies.&quot; The Arab paper &quot; Akhbar-el-Harb,&quot; inits issue of the 1st September, had  an article on  the reconstitution  of the douarassemblies (djemaas) by the law of July last, and the powers which  it was  proposed  toconfer on them.    Many douars [subdivisions of tribes], having in all a population of 700,000-800,000,have been annexed to communes de plein  exercise, the douar  assemblies  losing  their powers.   Before annexation a djemaa, or assembly,  had represented the interests  of a      [898-114]                              &quot;                           C
 douar, and  in regard to certain  matters it  was required by law that it  should be consulted ; after annexation it was held by the Court of Cassation that, being merely a section of the communes, a douar  could only be legally represented by the  municipal council, or, in the event of its interests  being  opposed to those of the commune as a whole, by a commission syndicate, so that  the douar found itself deprived  of certain guarantees in regard to the administration of the property.     The new law provides that in a commune de plein exercise every question, affecting a douar or a portion of a douar attached  to the  commune  shall be submitted to the douar assembly before being deliberated upon  by the. municipal council : and that the organisation, procedure, and functions of the assemblies, as well as the mode of appeal against any  decision of a municipal council, not in accordance with the recommendations of the assembly, should be provided for by decree.   This decree  has been prepared  by the government-general of Algiers, and at the  date of issue of the &quot; Akhbar-el-Harb&apos;&quot; was under examination by a committee of the Chamber.     The decree as drawn up provides  that an  assembly shall be elected by  the direct vote of the population  of the douar or fraction of a douar, and that it shall advise on (1) all questions relating  to the  property of the douar it represents;  (2) public works to be carried out  on the land in  possession of the douar;  (3) questions relating to the local roads serving this land ; (4) the nomination of members to serve on the  education committees;  (5) questions affecting the applicatioh of the principle of collective respon- sibility.   It  provides further that in the event of a dispute  between an assembly and the municipal council, the latters  decree shall  not be executed till it has been approved by the prefect; and that, moreover, not only the assembly but any interested party may appeal against the prefects decision to the governor-general in council.                                     TRIPOLI.     Said Ahmed. In regard to  this shaykh, whose arrival  at  Constantinople was recently announced [E.R. LXXXV, p.  4], Mr. Balfour  telegraphed to Sir  Reginald Wingate on the 16th September  [No. 1131] saying  that the Italian Government had pointed  out  that it  considered that events had made it necessary for Great Britain, Italy, and France, as signatories of the agreements  in regard to the Senussi,  to take common measures  to  prevent  his  return.  Mr. Balfour asked for the opinion of Sir Reginald Wingate, who on  the 18th September telegraphed [No. 1382] that  he agreed that, if possible, Said Ahmed should be prevented from returning to Africa.                                     ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Messages for King  Hussein. On the 20th  September Mr.  Balfour telegraphed [No. 1159]  the following  messages for the  King of Hejaz, on  the  occasion  of the Al Adha  feast :- (1) the  Manchester Syrian  Association sends  congratulations, and prays for a long and  happy reign   of His Majesty and  the prosperity  of his  people ; &apos;(z) the Arab officers now in camp  at Grantham transmit their  best and most  humblecongratulations to their beloved sovereign.&apos; YEMEN.     Control  given to  the Imam by the  Turks. On  the  2nd September Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed [No.  1294] that,  according to information which had been received at Aden, large portions  of Yemen had  been  made  over to the Imam Yehia by the Turks, the suggestion being that the Imam had made the  cession of  territory  a con- dition precedent for any further loans.   This cession was confirmed in another telegram [No. 1318] sent on the  18th  September,  in  which  Sir Reginald Wingate  said  that letters indicating that the control  of Yemen  had  been given to the Imam  had  been received at Aden ; one from an agent, and another from Said Pasha.

M: Chicheriris  reply  to Mr. Balfour. -On the  24th September Lord  Derbytransmitted [No.  1147] the following wireless message, dated the 24th September, fromM. Chicherin to Mr.  Balfour: -We have received your wireless message of the 22nd,and  we are glad  to  ascertain that it brings us much nearer to  the  solution . of thematter, especially in view  of the fact that you agree to disjoin  the  question of theimmediate exchange of official representatives, which  has  first to be settled, from thatof the reciprocal  repatriation of citizens of both countries  in general,  the solution  ofwhich is  more  complicated.  We have  always clearly  set forth the  principle  of reciprocity as that upon  which the transaction must be based.  It is unnecessary hereto repeat  the  details of the  plan according to  which  citizen  Litvinoff,  with theRussians  accompanying  him, and  Mr.  Lockhart, with the other  officials,  are to  be repatriated.  The same  has been sufficiently laid clown  in  our telegrams.  Whencitizen Litvinoff sends us a cyphered telegram from the port of embarkation confirminghis  departure, we ask that a telegram from the Norwegian representative guaranteeinghis (one word omitted) journey should be simultaneously sent to us.   Mr. Lockhart isnot,  imprisoned, but  seeing  the  dangerous character of certain  activities of his, forR,ussia&apos;s safety we saw ourselves compelled to avoid the possibility of their continuanceby creating for him a special regime under which he could do Russia  no harm.  He isin a  special apartment in the Kremlin, where the Swedish consul-general visited himto-clay, complimenting us as to  the good  conditions  granted  by us to Mr.  Lockhart.The  question of  the reciprocal  repatriation  of  our citizens is of a more  complicatedcharacter,  seeing  that, just because we are basing ourselves on reciprocity,  we mustinsist that the  precautionary measures on our  part  in regard to  British  citizens canonly be withdrawn when the numerous impressive measures against soviet  adherentsin all the regions in the  occupation  of the  allies have ceased.   Of  the women,the  children,  and the aged  some  have  already  been,  and  others  are  now being,repatriated.NORTHERN REGION.     The Governor-General. On the 24th  September Mr.  Lindley telegraphed [No. 199]that Colonel Dourov had been appointed governor-general on the 18th September, withM. de Bokar and General Samarin as his assistants, the former  for civil and  the  latterfor  military  affairs.   On  the  same  day the  Murmansk district was declared  by proclamation to be under the jurisdiction of the governor-general.     Mr. Lindley also reported that M.  Chaikowsky&apos;s proclamation had not  yet been published, on the ground that reports received from Omsk made it doubtful whether agovernment really existed at Samara.   In view  of this, M. Chaikowsky said that  he did not feel justified in declaring the Government of the Northern Region at an end, asit would be impossible for the governor-general to exercise his very extensive  functionswithout being  nominally responsible to  some body of persons lawfully elected by thepeople ;  he and  his remaining  colleagues would therefore stay for the present as aGovernment,  though  they  would fulfil no  executive functions,  and  Colonel Dourovwould enjoy the full powers already granted to him.
