The following wireless message was sent from Petrograd onthe 26th July :      The committee of the Menshevik  party in Moscow has just issued a manifesto toall workers on the present situation.   It  is stated in this document that the civil war has been brought about by General Denikin and Admiral  Kolchak, in  order  to restore the &quot; ancien regime &quot; and to deliver  the workers  to the vengeance of the  bourgeoisieand the generals, supported by Entente imperialism.  It  is  therefore the  sacred dutyof all who have the interests of the revolution at heart  to  enter the ranks of the red army.     Russian Non-party Workers support the Soviet Authority. -The following wireless message was despatched from Moscow on the 24th July:      The Moscow non-party conference of workers in the town district, having heard areport on the  general situation of the Soviet republic, decided  that the solution of thefood crisis was only possible by strictly adhering to the  Soviet food policy.  The successof this policy depends on the cessation of the economic destruction in all branches of life,  which in its turn can only be  brought  about by first  capturing the Baku oil andthe Donets coal.   To accomplish this,  it is necessary for the workmen and poor peasantsto concentrate all their strength  once  more and finally to  crush the  resistance ofDenikhTs, Kolchak&apos;s, and Rodsyanko&apos;s White guards and their friends, the internationalrobbers, as well as the rich peasants and White guard elements, which are undermining the Soviet authority in the interior  of the country.  Tbe conference is  completely in accord with the policy of the workmen&apos;s  and peasants&apos; government, and calls  on  allworkmen and peasants to exert all their strength to work for  the army in food supplytransport.   In order to combat profiteering, the conference expressed a wish to increasethe  activities of the workmen&apos;s control  by  including the greatest  number of theworking classes in it.       [450]                                                        .         B
     Increased Pay in the  Soviet Army. According to a wireless  message sent from Moscow on the 23rd July, the soviet of people&apos;s commissaries has decided that from the 1st August, 1919, the salaries of the Red army soldiers at the rear are to be increased from 50 roubles to 300 roubles, and at the front  from 350 roubles to  400  roubles  per month.     Bolsheviks and  Germans. Telegraphing&apos;  from  Stockholm on  the  25th July Mr.  Ramsav reported ! No. 1200] as follows :                                                                          tr.&apos;   - - *.-vsj     A press telegram from Berlin,  sent, on  the   2nd July by the  Svenska  telegram bureau, states that this  agency has  learnt from most reliable sources that unofficial negotiations are being carried on between the Germans and the  Bolsheviks, and that big industrialists in Germany are energetically working for the resumption of commercial relations  with  Russia with the  approval or at least the knowledge  of the German government and that the  Bolshevik government is  keenly interested  and anxious  to come to terms.     The correspondents had interviewed a well-known Bolshevik leader  recently arrived at Berlin direct from Moscow.   The latter  admitted  that  the  economic situation  in Russia was desperate, but asserted that Mr. Leniifs power was greater, than  ever, and that he had complete ascendancy over  Mr.  Trotsky.   A moderate tendency was now predominant and  several important jDosts had been assigned to  non-Bolsheviks, and officers from the old army obtained better appointments if they had  not gone over  to the  Bolsheviks.  Conciliation with  the  bourgeoisie was the  order  of the  day.   The Bolsheviks eagerly desired to  resume economic relations with  Germany and  also with the Entente and hoped for positive results in view  of the approaches  made by German industrialists.   Russia especially  wanted German  engineers, technical organizers, and skilled  workmen, particularly for  railways.   The Bolsheviks were  prepared to pay  iu gold ;  and they were  willing to agree to suspend their agitation in Germany in return for German aicl.     This Bolshevik leader also mentioned that it was desired  to obtain the  services of some 200 Swedish engineers and  technical experts,  whose salaries were to  he paid  in gold.  The Bolsheviks were willing to grant  considerable concessions  in return  for a resumption of commercial relations.     The &quot;Social Democraten&quot; considers the  above  statement to be credible but distrusts Mr. Lenhfs moderation.     According  to the &quot; Dagens Nyheter&quot;  nothing is  yet  known of the Bolshevik proposal in Swedish engineering circles.     Mr. Lenin&apos;s intervieio with  American  Journalists. The  following  was sent out ,from Moscow by wireless on the  25th July :       The &quot; Pravda  &quot; has published Mr. Lenin&apos;s replies to the American journalists.   In.answer to the question which  clause  of  the  original programme had undergone mostchange, Mr. Lenin replied that  it was  the  clause  dealing with the attitude adopted towards the bourgeoisie.   Mr. Lenin writes :  &quot; Alter the October revolution  we did not even close down any of the bourgeois papers  and there was no talk of declaring terror. We  not only liberated many of  Mr. Kerenski&apos;s ministers, but even Mr. Krashov whowas fighting against us.   It  was  only after  the  capitalists showed resistance that we started our systematic campaign against them which led to terror.&quot;   In answer to the question concerning the attitude  of the  Soviet authority towards  Afghanistan,  India, and Moslem countries outside (?) Russia, the policy of Soviet Russia with regard to the United States  and Japan,  and  the conditions on which the Soviet  authority  was prepared   to make  peace  with  Admiral Kolchak,  General Denikin  and  General Mannerheim, Mr. Lenin replied :  &quot; We are doing all we can to help  every nationality to develop independently.&quot;   Soviet authority has made  it possible for the Bashkirs  to establish an autonomous  republic in Russia; and  is now endeavouring to repulse  the brazen attacks  of the capitalists  of the United States, Japan, and of the other countries. Our future policy  towards all nations, including  the United States and Japan, consists in endeavouring to form a  fraternal  union with the toiling masses of all countries without exception.&quot;   Mr. Lenin then requested the journalist to inform  American public opinion of the following:  &quot; Capitalism is bound  to  tall.   The masses are realising  the necessity of revolution.  The Soviet republic is replacing  capitalism.&quot;  In  conclusion, Mr.  Lenin pointed out that not a single  bourgeois government would  dare to compete with Soviet Russia on the question of real liberty  and  would not agree to conclude a treaty  with her,  according to which the contracting parties would be permitted&apos; a free
exchange of pamphlets printed in any language which would contain  the  laws of thecountry in question and  a text of the constitution explaining its  superiority over theconstitutions of other countries.   Not a single bourgeois government would venture to conclude such  an honest,  democratic treaty  with  us,  as  they are only able to existby oppression and deception.   The great war, however, has unmasked deception.    Mr. Lenin and the Calmucks. A message  from  Moscow -to  Tashkend, on  the25th July,  states that Mr. Lenin has sent an appeal to the Calmuck workers to join the ranks of the Red army.  Mr. Lenin ^declares that, although Soviet Russia had given theCalmucks absolute freedom, the capitalists and landowners  took away their land  andare oppressing them with the help of English and French bayonets.    The soviet of the people&apos;s commissaries has decided to render help to the Calmuckpeople and will place a sufficient amount  of cattle  at their  disposal.   An All-Russiancongress of the  Calmuck  people  is going to discuss their needs.  Mr. Lenirfs appealconcludes with the following words : Brother Calmucks, the fate of your  own peoplerests in your own hands.   Every one of you  must  join  the ranks of the  Red army.Every one of you must fight against the Cossack bands of the Tsarist generals, in orderto defend the Soviet power.    The Harvest in Russia.- The  following wireless  message  was  sent out  from moscow  on  the 23rd July: The  people&apos;s  commissary for labour  is organising thetransfer of 10,000 agricultural labourers to the Saratoff government, where, accordingto a telegram from  the  peoples commissary for  education, there  is an  unprecedentedgrain harvest and men must be sent to assist in gathering it.TURKESTAN.    Bolshevik  Propaganda. Messages sent  from   Moscow  to Tashkend for generalcirculation contain the following statements :--    The del 3gation sent  by Admiral Kolchak to  Paris  is entirely composed of Tsaristreactionary officials.  Mr. Neratoff is a member of the delegation.  He is one of theauthors  of the Anglo-Russian  treaty for the partition of Persia, and has written amemorandum on tbe necessity of subjecting Afghanistan  to England.   The Britishgovernment  has officially  declared  that  it does not recognize the  independence ofGeorgia and the other Caucasian republics.    The English have  intensified   their propaganda  and  the bribing of traitors inBukhara and Khiva.  Turkestan is at present a bulwark of revolution in the  East andthe base of the Indian and Persian  masses in their struggle  for independence.   TheSoviet  government is  the unselfish friend  of the Moslem  masses,  who aspire toemancipation  and wish  to annihilate the  imperialistic  and capitalistic domination ofEngland.OMSK GOVERNMENT.    The Finnish Agreement. On the 24th July, Mr. OReilly, telegraphing [No. 662]from  Vladivostock, reported  that, in order to show his readiness to  accept the present government in Finland,  Admiral Kolchak had appointed a Russian charge  d&apos;affaires forthat country :  though he had  refused to sign the Finnish agreement and had  requestedGeneral Yudenich not to sign  it.    Situation  at Irkutsk. On the  25th July  Mr. OReilly  transmitted [No.  666A]a message sent, on the 21st July, by the consul at Irkutsk.   The latter said that  therewere  good  reasons for believing  that an agitation  in  favour of a  counter-revolutionagainst Admiral Kolchak was  being actively worked  by the social revolutionaries ofthat locality.   He had been informed by a Czech officer in  a  prominent position  thatthe Czechs had been sounded  by the  social  revolutionaries in regard  to their probable attitude in the event of there  being  a change of government.  The Czechs had said inreply that  they would  treat  all alike if disturbances should take place and they be compelled  to restore order :  their intention  was not to side with either  party.   the consul added that there was no doubt  that efforts were  being  made to undermineAdmiral Kolchak&apos;s  authority, but he thought that the presence  of the  Czech  troops would prevent any serious outbreak in the town.

                                    POLAND.     Proposed British Mission to reorganize the Police. On the 23rd July Lord Curzon.informed  [No.  175] Sir Percy  Wyndham  that  Mr. Balfour had been requested  toascertain whether Mr. Paderewski would welcome a British mission if one were sent toWarsaw for the purpose of reorganizing the administration of the Polish police ; andthat it was  understood that the idea of such a mission  was favourably regarded byMr.  Paderewski.     French View of the Situation in Poland.   On the  28th July Lord Acton reported[No. 1150] that a French official  agent, employed in Berlin,  who was  then in  Berne,had  warned his government, after a recent visit to Poland, that the situation  in  thatcountry was far from stable, and that therefore it should not engage itself too deeply inits fortunes.     Poland, Lithuania, and Germany. The following wireless message was sent  fromWarsaw on the 23rd July :      The National  Democratic party and others  in Warsaw have adopted a  lengthyresolution on  the question  of liberating  South  Suwalki  from  foreign troops.   Theresolution states that since the armistice arranged between the Germans and the alliescame into force,  the German occupation  of South Suwalki illegally continues.   Underthe  protection of the  Germans, the Lithuanian &quot; Taryba &quot; has tried to force upon that province, in which there are few or no Lithuanians,  administrative dependence  on the lithuanian government.   The Suwalki and  Augustow districts and the purely Polishparts of the Sejny  district opposed  this  attempt, and  protested against any  kind ofdependence on the Lithuanian government.  These same districts took part, without opposition from the Germans, in  the elections to the  diet.   From that time  forwardthere has existed in these districts a partly secret Polish administration, as represen-tatives of the Polish authorities were from time to time obliged to hide themselves toavoid arrest and deportation,     By the conditions of the armistice in  November the  Germans were to leave the territories which in 1914 belonged to tbe Russian empire, and this  order was repeatedby  Marshal Foch.   In spite of this, however, the  Germans did not leave and neitherthe  Polish authorities nor  the Polish army was able to occupy this territory in spite ofthe repeated demands of the diet and in spite of the  declarations of the local  population,which was being  cruelly  tormented  by  the Germans.   In the  middle of July the sufferings of the population considerably increased and  Polish rights were still furtherviolated as the Germans admitted the Lithuanian authorities and the Lithuanian army to  the territory  they  occupied without, however,  withdrawing themselves.   TheGermans  proclaimed that  the  Augustow  canal  should  be  the  southern  frontier ofLithuania which would cut off  from  Poland the whole Suwalki  and Sejny districts and  more than one-half of the  Augustow district.   The  Polish authorities are quitehelpless in the face  of the violence committed by the  Lithuanians under the protection ofthe German troops.   The last named are  destroying the Polish villages  and  are makingpreparations to take possession of the harvest.     The Polish population comments upon this  as  follows: &quot; The Lithuanians  have come to an agreement that in return for the  Germans  equipping their  arnw they willhand over  to them part,  of  this  year&apos;s  harvest.    Now they  are  occupying  thePolish part of  the country  in order to carry out this  bargain at the  expense  of thePolish population.     Documentary evidence of the unheard of violence of the Germans and Lithuanianstowards the helpless Polish population was taken to  Paris by  a  special  delegation andthe  Polish government and the general staff have been  frequently informed  of the  stateof  affairs.  The population  presumes  from  the  conduct of  the government  thatdiplomatic action has no prospect of success.  The  Polish diet has accordingly  beenasked to pass a resolution in the following sense  -     1.  That the Polish government must take immediate steps for obtaining possessionof the Polish part of Suwalki by force of arms.     2.  That the Polish government shall protest  strongly  to  the  peace   conferenceagainst the continued violation of the armistice conditions by the Germans.     3.  That the Polish government shall  demand that the Lithuanians stop taking by force non-Lithuanian districts,  ami that the Polish  government should offer armedresistance to any such attempts.
                                  LITHUANIA.    Fear of the- Poles. On  the 26th July  Mr. Slelevicius, Lithuanian  minister  forforeign  affairs, telegraphing from Kovno, complained that in spite  of Marshal Foch&apos;sexpress order, which had been remitted to the  Poles on the previous day by the french military mission, the line of  demarcation had  again been passed.   The  Lithuaniangovernment therefore  urgently  begged of Great Britain  to  stop without  delay thefurther  invasion of  its  territory by  the Polish  army, which  had already crossed theNiemen and occupied a portion of southern Lithuania.  There was imminent danger ofthe outbreak of a  relentless  war  between  Lithuania and Poland :  and  the Britishgovernment was begged to prevent a conflagration which might cover the whole  of eastern  Europe.                                   RUMANIA.    Relations loith Russia. A  wireless  message sent out  from Vienna and interceptedon the 26th July states that according to official reports from Bukarest, the governmenthave broken off  negotiations with Soviet Russia, and a  state of war again exists  asfrom midnight on the 24th July.  The Russian Bolshevik peace delegation has departedvia Kischineff.                                    TURKEY.    New  Cabinet. On the 23rd July Admiral  Calthorpe reported  [Nos. 1521, 1522]that a new cabinet  had been formed as follows : -Damad Ferid Pasha, grand vizier and minister for foreign affairs ; Sabri EfFendi, shaj^kh ul Islam and acting president of thecouncil  of state ;  Nazim  Pasha (late president of court  martial)  minister for  war;Salih Pasha (now  in  Switzerland)  minister  of  marine;  Add Bey  (formerly under-secretary  of state  at  the grand vizirate),  minister  of  the interior;  Mustapha Bey(ex-deputy),  minister  of justice ; Abouk  Pasha,  minister  ol public  works and acting-minister of commerce ; Tewfik  Bey, minister  of finance;  Said Bey,  minister of publicinstruction ;  Hamdi Effendi, minister of pious foundations (evkaf);  Tewfik Pasha,Izzet Pasha, and Ali  Riza Pasha, all without  office though the last-named  acts  as  minister of marine  till the arrival of Salih Pasha.     Admiral Calthorpe  remarked  that this was as weak  a cabinet as any there hadbeen  since the  armistice, and  that it had come into power at  a  moment when theinfluence of the central government was at its lowest ebb in the provinces.     The  General  Situation. On  the   27th  July  Admiral  Calthorpe  telegraphed[No.  1548]  for the purpose of  explaining exactly what he had meant in a  previoustelegram  i No.  1525] when  he  spoke of the extreme  gravity of the situation.   TheTurks, he said, had gradually realized the extent of their defeat aud had been preparedto cede a  considerable  portion of the  Ottoman dominions :  they had, too, been  looking for support and  guidance to Great Britain.   But the subsequent Greek occupation of smyrna, following as it did on the Italian encroachments in Anatolia, had made it clear to the Turks that they had nothing to look for from any western  Christian power, andconsecpiently bad led to a consolidation of the  majority of Turkish  parties and in fact toa very lively and vigorous resuscitation of the C.U. P.  Admiral Calthorpe added thatthe possibility of the establishment of an independent and probably fanatical  govern-ment &apos;in Asia Minor,  rejecting the sovereignty of the sultan and  the authority  ofConstantinople,  should be taken into consideration.     The Ottoman League.-On  the 24th July,  telegraphing  from Berne, Lord Actonreported [No. 1127] that  Jevdet Bey, president of the Ottoman League, had asked themilitary attached department whether the league could count upon the support of hismajesty&apos;s government.  Jevdet  Bey, Lord Acton said, had the  ear of the sultan : hewas remaining in Berne, and would send  agents to Constantinople where the greaterDart of the league would be established.  It would too, he said, be understood thatthe league  had become  pronouncedly Anglophil ; latterly it had acted in  the  interestsof France and formerly was probably in German  pay.     Greeks in Turkey. On the 26th July Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed as follows[No.  1538]:-     My colleagues and I are addressing  to the  Greek high  commissioner a joint notecalling  his serious attention  to the  present  provocative  attitude of  the Greeks and
Hellenics here towards the Turks.   We cite  especially the continued presence here ofOttoman Greeks, who  have served in the Hellenic army during the war, still wearingtheir uniforms and  entitled to enlist Ottoman Greeks in Hellenic army, and also  thepolitical: use made  of  the boy scouts movement;  we  point  out  that  many of hisexcellency&apos;s frequent complaints are directly due to this unwise conduct.                                    ARABIA.     King  Hussein  and Ibn Saud.-On  the  25th  July Lord  Curzon  telegraphed[No. 880] to General Allenby telling  him that Colonel Wilson should be instructed tomake known to the king  of Hejaz that the British government did not propose  totake any further action in regard to the arbitration between him and Ibn Saud, whichhad been proposed, as he had refused  its offer to act as arbitrator.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     The Peace Delegates. On the 24th July the viceroy reported the arrival  of  theAfghan delegates  at the  British  lines, and  on  the  following  day their arrival  atRawalpindi.     The negotiations began on the 26th July.   In reply to a speech by Sir  HamiltonGrant, Ali Ahmed spoke  at a  considerable length,  presenting  the  Afghan case  as strongly as possible but  Sir  Hamilton  thought,  without  any intention  of beingoffensive.   Sir Hamilton Grant also said that he thought that  the Afghans were anxious for peace ;  but the temper of Ali  Ahmed,  who  was a vain,  hot-tempered, blustering,florid man, might make him impossible at any moment.  Sir Hamilton Grant&apos;s report ofAli Ahmed&apos;s speech  was telegraphed  by the viceroy [10935] on the 27th July.     Proclamation by the Amir. On the 27th July the viceroy transmitted a message,dated  the  25th July, from Sir George Ross-Keppel, who reported that he had obtained a  copy of a new proclamation  issued by  the amir  to  the  frontier tribes.   In  this document it was stated that if an honourable peace with all respect and honour  forAfghanistan were obtained well and good ;  otherwise a holy war would be carried on bythe amir until death.
