Trotsky,people&apos;s commissary for war, sent out the following wireless message to foreign soldiersin Russia :      Soldiers, Englishmen,  Americans,  Frenchmen, Italians,  Servians,  Yougo!   Thesituation  becomes more and more difficult:  already the English  and. American pressspeaks  of the  hopeless  situation of  the Archangel  expedition.   Your  governments have thrown you into the cold North, and now  in  this situation they leave you there.Notwithstanding our  frank offer of peace, your governments  have not yet  consented  tomake peace, but they understand the impossibility  of crushing  Soviet Russia by armed force.   You are the victims of these waverings ; your resistance is  fruitless.  They try to frighten  you by telling you that if you are taken prisoner you will be the victims  offerocious treatment.   Soldiers,, this is a lie.   The  Soviet government  knows that youare not guilty  of the predatory irruption across our  northern  boundaries;  you were compelled to do  it by your imperialists.   If you surrender you  will  find a friendlyreception with us ; none of  you will suffer.   The Soviet government guarantees,  beforeall the world, that not a single hair  will fall from - the  head  of any  foreign  soldier  orofficer who may be taken  prisoner.   Do not believe the lies and the calumnies of yourvenal newspaper writers :  believe the  word  of  honour  of  the Russian workers  andpeasants.   Put an end to this absurd resistance.   Down with the infamous slaughtercarried on in the interests of the French. English, and American capitalist :  long live theunion of Russian,  American, English, French, and Italian workers !     Manifesto to Entente Working People. By.a manifesto issued  on  the  21st  April,M.  Chicherin calls upon  the work-people of  the Entente to continue their pressure ontheir governments in order to prevent the strangulation of the Russian revolution.  For.a year, he says, the Entente governments have been  trying to convert  Russia into  a colony of capitalism.   The pretext for the despatch  of troops to Russia was an attack onthe Germans from the East ; their real enemy, however, was Soviet Russia.  The latter,faced by two enemies, was powerless to repel either the German  invasion or the Ententeintrusion.     When  the soldiers of the Entente, M. Chicherin  continues, refused  to go out  and,fight against Soviet  Russia, all the writers of the capitalist world were  mobilised  to
 disseminate calumnies about her.   In London and  in  Paris  there have been  immense demonstrations by work-people to protest against the crushing of Russia.  The govern- ments of France and Great Britain pretend to have abandoned their plans of military intervention, and declare that they will confine themselves to helping Russian counter- revolutionaries,  and  to  supporting neighbouring  countries  in  their fight  against Bolshevism.   The Entente governments have had to abandon  the idea of attacking Russia because their soldiers refuse to fire on Russian workmen.   But in the meantime these governments help to maintain a reactionary regime in  Poland,  Rumania, Finland, South Russia,  Archangel, and above all in Kolchak&apos;s territory, where  there is a veritable reign of terror.  At the same time they wish to make the workmen of the Entente believe that they want to help Russia  by sending her food.   They, who  are  giving assistance to the most  savage reaction and to the most violent  monarchism  in order to strangle the workmen&apos;s revolution, think they will succeed in persuading Russia  that they are sincere in this.     The manifesto concludes :  Workmen of the Entente !   The workmen and peasants of Russia will not lay down their arms until  they have hunted their enemies from the territory of the Russian  revolution, not until they have disposed of the danger which threatens the  conquests  of the  workmen&apos;s revolution.  Without halting before any sacrifice, supporting with inflexible courage the sufferings of hunger and every privation, the workmen and peasants of revolutionary Russia call  upon you likewise not to lay down your arms and not to slacken your pressure on your governments until you  have obliged them to cease all attacks on revolutionary Russia, and until they have abandoned every menace to her liberty and every support of her mortal enemies.  It  is none other than your governments that nourish civil war  among us by supporting  the counter- revolutionaries  and, thanks  to the criminal blockade of Soviet Russia, by creating famine and unemployment.   Once  deprived of their.help the  Russian  counter-revolution will become  powerless.   The suppression  of the  blockade !   That is the sole means of putting an end to famine in  Russia.  Force your governments therefore to cease their diabolical games and their perfidious attempts to  strangle, by the hands of the counter- revolutionaries, the liberty conquered by the workmen  and peasants of Russia,  who  at last are liberated from the burden of exploitation and from every other yoke.     The Bolshevik Army. The Bnssian communist party, while,  adopting M. Trotsky&apos;s principles as a  basis for  military  questions, considers it  necessary  that the following practical measures should be carried out :      1.  Mobilisation of the  classes  and only of  active elements.  The  exploiting and parasitical elements are  to  be carefully separated   and allotted  to  special  labour battalions.     2.  The appointment of reliable military  experts to executive and administrative posts is -to be continued, but they must be  subordinate to the political control of the commissaries.     3.  The introduction of a system of certificates ;  such certificates  to  be periodically examined by the commissaries.     4.  An increase and improvement in the formation  ot  cadres  from proletarians and &quot;semi-proletarians,&quot;  for which  purpose competent  examining, committees are to  be formed behind  and at the front, consisting chiefly of party representatives.  They will have to select for the officers&apos;schools those members of the  army  who are  especially suited to the role of a Red officer, and to revise-the  course of instruction&apos;  according  to the spirit of the Red army.     5.  The introduction by the local party organisations  of a systematic communistic education for the troops behind the front.     6.  The systematic  distribution of communists among the army and the fleet.     7.  Co-ordination and definition of the political committees,  political  sections, and groups.     8. The dissolution of the All-Russian bureau  of war commissaries and  the creationof a political section of the revolutionary war  council;  the transference  to this sectionof all the formeFs functions.     9. The revision and curtailment of military regulations.   All obsolete regulations to be cut out;and all those which give the command unnecessary privileges.     10. Separation  of  the  functions of  commissaries and commanders.  Economic andadministrative  questions will be settled !by them conjointly, but the  commissary shouldhave the right  of inflicting disciplinary punishment,  including the right of arrest andhanding over to the  tribunal.     11. The recognition of the so-called special sections of the army.
     12.  It  is necessary that in  future, when elaborating  general lines  of conduct,regulations, and instructions, these should be first laid before  the political assistants ofthe army for discussion.     A Peasants&apos; University.  A peasants&apos; university has been established on a formerprivate estate at Krassnoye in the Tula government.   The course will be a three years&apos;one,  and will  include natural  science,  history,   sociology,  geography,  literature,agriculture, and similar subjects.  There are carpenters,  bookbinders, smiths, and work--shops  attached  to it,  in addition to 50 hectares of arable land, vegetable garden, andorchards.TJKRAINA.     The Evacuation of Odessa. -Telegraphing on the  20th  April [No.  812], admiral calthorpe x-eported that nothing could exceed the bitterness of feeling of the Russianstowards  the French  in  regard to their behaviour in Odessa and Constantinople ; and hehad heard the same story from Greek  wounded  troops.  The  evacuation of Odessa andthe dumping of refugees in Constantinople could not fail to have a disastrous moral effect on the population of the latter place ;  on Turks, Greeks, and Armenians alike.     There had  been a large influx  of  Russian refugees  into Constantinople  in con-sequence of the evacuation,  the number being  estimated by M. Sazonoffs representative at approximately between six and seven thousand ; a large proportion of them belongingto the better classes,  strong opponents of Bolshevism, among whom were many officersanxious to go to some other front.  Their treatment by  the French had been  unneces-sarily  arbitrary and  hai&quot;sh- money, Admiral Calthorpe had  been  creditably informed,was the  only road to any lenient treatment, whether in Odessa or in  Constantinople ;whilst the neglect of the French authorities to make suitable  arrangements in advancehad led to considerable  confusion.   The condition of the Russians was so deplorable thathe had several times been compelled to intervene from mere motives of humanity.   Hehad offered to take over the accommodation and supply of these refugees, but GeneralFranchet d&apos;Esperey had finally decided that  he would be responsible for all evacuated from the French zone.     There were  also some  four hundred Poles who  had come to  Constantinople fromOdessa and  were anxious to return to Poland : in regard  to them he was consulting withthe French authorities.OMSK  GOVERNMENT.     Bolshevik Conspiracy at Ekaterinberg. On the 17th Apxdl Mr. Robertson, tele-graphing from  Vladivostock, transmitted  [No.  378] a telegram  from the consul  atEkaterinberg informing him that the authorities had discovered a Bolshevik  conspiracy,which had for its object the re-establishment of the Soviet power in that place.  Therewere many -Tews among the forty who had been arrested : five of  them who had comefrom Moscow, had been  well supplied with Romanoft money.   Eight of those arrestedhad already been shot.EASTERN SIBERIA.     A   Bolshevik Declaration. -On  the  18th  April  Mr.   Robertson,  telegi^aphing[No. 382] from  Vladivostock, reported  that  the [? Japanese] officer in command of theallied troops had issued a declai-ation to the armed peasants requiring them to withdrawbehind a specified line.  To this a reply had been  received,  dated the 15th April, andsigned by &quot; [? the commander  of] the volunteer army of peasants and workmen in  thename  of the federal-Soviet republic of ali Russia.&quot;   The substance of this reply was asfollows:      &quot;We [? loyal I  peasants declare that  we  cannot  recognise any allied command,inasmuch as the governments of Japan, France, England, Italy, and America have tiledto  suppress  the great  Russian  revolution,  which is the  foundation of the liberty of thewox-king classes  of the world.     &quot; The allies invaded Siberia, falsely promising not to interfere with Russia&apos;s internal affairs, but  are  in [group undecypherable] seizing  railways, mines, and  other  riches.Owing to  their  help, the  Russian  capitalist class  is temporarily in power,  and  hascommenced  to exterminate the wox-kmen and peasants.   We however do  not recognisethis govex-nment. The  allies declare that they have come to  Siberia to keep order,  but
who. authorised  them  to  keep order in our territoiy ?  And is it  keeping order towander over the conntry in support  of Kolchak&apos;s troops, flogging  and shooting the peaceful  inhabitants, of burning  villages, as was  done by the Japanese in the Amurprovince ?  The  workmen and  peasants of Russia in Europe who have a Soviet govern-ment have not  been oppressed; those of Siberia  are being oppressed by the allied troops and  those of Kolchak.   It is  not only the Bolsheviks and the Red guard whooppose the allies but the peasants and workmen.   We are asked to allow the siberian railway  and  [group undecypherable] Ann branch  line to be worked so that the allied troops and those of Kolchak may move to [? exterminate] us.  This is not only childishbut  insolent.  The orders should  come from us, not from the allies, whom we summonto return to their own countries.     &quot;We  shall  not cede one  inch of railway, and we declare war to the death.   Wehave the whole of the working  class of the world on our side.     &quot; Victory will  rest with us.  Our aim is Vladivostock, and we shall force the allies to leave it as they had to leave Odessa and Archangel.&quot;     Mr. Robertson went on to say that this was so clearly a Bolshevik production thathe had telegraphed it nearly in  extenso.   It was not, however, clear that the declarationhad  been issued with the concurrence of the majority of the armed peasants : and theJapanese commandant was sending a delegate to negotiate, if possible, before resorting to force.   They  did not think that serious fighting would  ensue.LITHUANIA.     The Cabinet-On the 20th April  Mr. Grant Watson reported  [No. 22]. that the lithuanian cabinet crisis, which had lasted  since  the  24th  March,  had  been solved.M. Slezovcihius  was prime minister and M. Voldemar foreign minister; the latter wasto remain at Paris as head of the. peace delegation.  ,     Delegates sent  to Warsaw. On the&apos;  22nd April Mr. Grant Watson,  telegraphingfrom Libau, reported [No. 27]  that on  the 17th April delegates had  left for Warsawwith the intention of arranging for  joint  action  against the Bolsheviks,  and of ascertaining how the, Poles regarded, the independence of  Lithuania.     Resumption of Trade Relations. On the 20th April  a circular telegram was sentto all British representatives informing them that  the blockade council had authorizedtrade with Lithuania as from the 14th April in the  following terms i j     In agreement  with  the  other associated  powers,  his  majesty&apos;s  government  hasdecided that trade  relations with Lithuania may forthwith be resumed. . . . .     The attention  of exporters is called to the fact that  goods  sent to Lithuania mustbe intended for the internal needs of that country,  and that connivance on their part atre-exportation to countries with which the resumption of  trade  has  not been approvedwill  render them liable to prosecution.WHITE RUSSIA.     Complaints   against the Poles. On the 22nd  April  Mr. Grant  Watson reported from Libau  [No. 27! that the White  Russian minister was afraid  that the  WhiteRussians would call for Bolshevik help against the Poles if  the  latter continued to actas they  had been  doing.  The  complaint against them was  that,  having occupiedBialystok and other towns, they  had behaved as  conquerors,  suppressing the use ofthe Russian language, closing the Russian&apos; churches and schools, and so on.                                    POLAND.     International Armistice Commission. -On the 18th April  Mr. Balfour reported[No. 724] that the  supreme council had agreed that, for the purpose of hearing therepresentatives of the Polish and Ukrainan governments in regard to the recent fightingnear Lemberg, the governments of  Great Britain, America, France,  and Italy should.each appoint two members to the armistice commission.                                    TURKEY.     The Execution of Kiamil Pasha IE.R.  No.   CXVI, p.  5.] On  the  17th AprilAdmiral  Calthorpe reported [? No.  799 A] that a large collection had been made  forKiamifs  children, and that  there had  been  a  demonstration of  sympathy  at  the
internment  of his remains, which  had been  given  to  his relatives.   There,  was a widespread  tendency to  regard  him  as  tbe  first  martyr  to  a good  cause;   a  factindicative of the influence  still exercised by the C.U.P.   Horror of the demonstratorshad been expressed by the grand  vizier, who  had stated that it was his intention topunish them.   In all probability, however,  the executions of persons  responsible forthe  deportations  are regarded by  many  of  his own  supporters,  not as  the just-punishment of criminals, but rather as a necessary concession  to  the Entente.  It-remained to be seen whether the government  would have  the  courage  to take drastic-action on any large scale, especially when the criminals were highly placed.ANATOLIA.     Italian Movements. On the  16th April Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed [No. 779]that a report had been received from the senior naval officer at Smyrna  that, accordingto the Turkish military authorities, Italians had landed on the coast of Asia Minor.     On the 19th April Admiral  Calthorpe  telegraphed  [No.  805] that a report  hadbeen received from the British military representative at Egerdir containing information-of Italian movements inland.   They &quot;were expected at Bulour, and had already reachedBudjak.   The Italians were, the military representative added, carrying on an extensivepropaganda :  they were  piftting sugar and rice en  the market at very  low prices, and giving clothes to Turkish officials.     Greek Intentions. On the 18th April Mr. Balfour  reported [No. 719], in  regardto the alleged intention of the Greek government to land troops, that Sir Louis  Mallethad been informed by M. Venizelos that his government had no such intention.   If inthe future intervention should become inevitable, the allies would be first communicated with.                                    GREECE.     Ex-King Constantine. On the 21*st April  Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 233]in regard to the contents of Lord Acton&apos;s message from Berne [E.R. CXVI, p. 5], whichhe said was just the sort of thing  put out in Athens by partisans of King Constantine.Lord Granville very much doubted  King Alexander being as ready at the present time as he was formerly to abdicate in favour of his father.  As to M. Venizelos, it was truethat, partly on account  of the incompetence  of some of his ministers and  partly onaccount of the irritation  produced  by the obvious belief in Europe that he was the onlyGreek who  counted,  there was a  not  inconsiderable feeling against him.  But LordGranville was convinced that  he  would  obtain a  larger  majority  if  he  returned to greece with anything like the new territory he was claiming.                              SYRIA AND  ARABIA.     Christians of the Hauran. On the 17th April  General Clayton  reported [No. 560]that he had received the following from the accredited representative of the Christiansof the Hauran : -     To the peace conference,  Paris.  Being  empowered by the agents of the nativeChristians of  the Hauran, Syria, and confirmed in  same by general public opinion,  Ibeg to  raise  my voice  to the honourable members of  the conference,  stating  that independence would not  suit Syria on the ground of historical facts that are known toyou and on account of the various contending  sects to be found in  the country, there-fore we beg the British government to  safeguard our rights  and to see that due justiceis done to all  alike as it is done in the civilised world.     Syria and Great Britain. On the  20th April General Clayton reported [No. C 117]that many persons living in Syria  had asked whether, should it be offered, Great britain would accept  a mandate for that country.  The reason for  these  inquiries was  that  a -considerable section of the population was anxious for Great Britain to have a mandate,but was reluctant to ask for it  if  agreements  with  France  would prevent acceptance.Should that  be  the  case  it  proposed asking that the mandate should  be given to america.     General  Clayton said that he had told such inquirers that any power to which  a mandate might be offered (should  the mandate principle  be adopted) would be free toaccept or refuse, being absolved from  any  previous commitments;  but  that be could give them no  idea as to whether this country would accept such a mandate if offered.
     Emir  Feisal. On  the  18th  April  Lord  Derby  reported  [No. 639]  that the&quot; Temps &quot; had announced that the Emir Eeisal was to leave Paris that day, and that hewould embark at Taranto, where the  French government had placed a cruiser at his-disposal for the journey to Syria.     The &quot;Matin&quot; said that he expected to return in six  weeks&apos; time.  It spoke of along-delayed conversation with M. Clemenceau, which soon brought about an agreement.   ^Emir Feisal was, according to the &quot; Matin,&quot; persuaded, in common with all Syrians,  &apos;*that the only European nation which could assure the independence of Syria was France.This he would make clear to his compatriots.  The Anglo-French  agreement of  1916seemed to have  been  given  up.   Among  other objections  to this treaty was that of  .trying to split up Syria.  The French government and the Emir Feisal would follow accmmon policy which  would re-establish its integrity and independence.     Ibn Saud.--General Allenby reported  on the 21st April [No. 616]  that ColonelWilson had informed King Hussein as to the message which had been sent to Ibn Saud,which he had repeated to him.  The king  said that, as there was a growing belief thatGreat Britain was supporting Wahabism  in order to bring about the disintegration ofIslam, the message was opportune :  he was  at once relieved and  pleased.  Ibn  Saudhad  written friendly  letters  to the  king  and  one of his  sons,  and a  satisfactoryanswer was being sent.   General Allenby  added that the Khurma situation seemed tohe much easier.o
