30RET.PPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXIX.                                    RUSSIA.   THE  situation continues to grow more definite, the Bolsheviks becoming less and s ashamed of their German alliance, the anti-Bolsheviks more and more pronouncedly )-Entente as their organisation improves.

The laying of the foundation  stone  of the  Hebrew  University is  of importance. e event passed off very satisfactorily.   The recruiting for the King of Hejaz&apos;s forces Palestine improves.                                   ARABIA.   The  recrudescence  of friction  between King  Hussein and Ibn Saud is  very ^retable and will prove  a  cause of anxiety for some time to come.  There are really  rights or wrongs  about the case, except that  Khurma is nearer  King hussiens ritories than Ibn Saud&apos;s.  The present writer is convinced that the friction is due to rkish agents.                                   PERSIA.   The situation is somewhat better.                                  ARMENIA.   The views  of Great  Britain  and France  as expressed  by Mr. Balfour  and Clemenceau are  to be noted.   The Central Powers&apos; policy is to endeavour to  split i Turkish Armenians  from the Caucasian Armenians by offering the latter indepen-lice and the former special protection against the Turks.                                  APPENDIX.I  Particular attention is drawn to the memorandum  of Captain Phillips, it gives  anlightening picture of the first small buddings of a national feeling in  the Sudan, and h indication that this feeling might be used to stimulate recruiting.

The  Attempt  at  Counter-revolution. rThe  Russian  Government  sent out  thefollowing by wireless on the 25th July : -     The  special  investigation  committee, which was  appointed to  inquire  into  themutiny at Yaroslav, has found  that among the large number of persons  arrested were350 men  who, in the majority  of cases,  were  ex-officers of  the  counter-revolutionaryWhite  Guards.   The  investigation  has  also  shown that among  them  are activeparticipants  in  and organisers  of the mutiny,. who  led  it  and associated  themselves with the Czecho-Slovaks.  This band  of 350 men, by order  of the commission, has been shot.  In the town all is calm.  The civil  authority  is concentrated in the hands of themilitary revolutionary committee,  and  the military authority  is  in  charge  of  thecommander of the garrison.  Life is again beginning to be normal.  The town itself has suffered heavily from the bombardment.     From Nizhni-Novgorod we are informed that many arrests have been made amongstthe local White Guards and counter-revolutionaries, from  among whom the counter-revolutionary bands were recruited.   Recently Nizhni-Novgorod  had been made anoperating base for a counter-revolutionary conspiracy.  All the arrested persons will besent to Moscow and placed at the disposition of  the extraordinary commission for  thestruggle against the counter-revolution.  By a. decision of a special commission composedof representatives of the Nizhni-Novgorod Soviet and of the extraordinary commission,and of a representative of the All-Russian  extraordinary  commission, five officers havebeen shot for participation  in  armed  mutiny against the soviet authority at Moscow ;they were captured at Lukyanov  whilst taking train in order to join the Czecho-Slovaks,via Kazan.   Much money was  found  on  them, which  they  had received  from theirleader, Colonel Sakharov.     For the last eight days all non-Bolshevik papers have been suspended.     About  a dozen  Revolutionary Socialists of the Left, who  have taken part  in  therecent events, including Blumkin  and  Popov, were shot. yesterday.SECRET,HO*Arabia,    Hejaz.

     Recruiting  for the Murmansk, and  the  Czechs forbidden. A  Russian  wireless message  of the  25th July says  that M.  Trotsky has issued the following warning :At different places the councils&apos; authorities are concealing  Polish,  Serbian,  Czecho-Slovak, and other officers and soldiers,  who  are  being  directed  by French  recruitingagents to  the  Murmansk or the  Czecho-Slovak  troops.  In  this manner  foreignimperialists  are  recruiting mercenaries  within Russian  territories for  a  war against russia.  I warn all whom it may concern that :      1. No  person  has  the  right to go to  the Murmansk,  Archangelsk,  or  regions           occupied by  Ozecho-Slovaks  without the  authorisation of  the  People&apos;s           Commissioner for War.     2. Any  person who engages himself to foreign imperialists  for participation in           mutinies or  for the occupation of Russian territory  will  be punished with           death.     This warning  is placarded in the  Russian, Polish,  and  Czecho-Slovak languagesin all  railway stations  and carriages, and no person therefore  may  plead ignorance of it.     Bolshevik Charges against the Allies. The following message was sent out by russian  wireless on the 26th July :      Proofs are accumulating that there is close  connection between the murder  of CountMirbach  and the revolutionary  attempts which took place  simultaneously in moscow and  in other towns of  Russia, and which had as  their  aim the resumption of the-war  with Germany.   The attack  on Count Mirbach took place on the afternoon of the6th  July.   On  the same day,  and almost at the same  hour in the afternoon, arisingbegan at Yaroslav,  after the  arrival there of  a Serbian  major and two  other  Ententeofficers, and, ,at  about midday on the 6th July, of 106 men of  the so-called volunteers ofthe north from Vologda.  The  mutinous  White  Guards in Yaroslav were informed byEntente  agents that they could  immediately commence the  fighting, and that strongtroop transports of the Entente were already hurrying up from the north.  During thefighting  on the following day the leader of the White  Guards declared in an official announcement   that they were-at war with  Germany,  and  that the  German  ReliefCommission, with about 2,000  people under  its  protection, war  and  civilian prisoners,were arrested and interned  in  the theatre.  When the  White Guards  saw that theirgame  was up, they handed over  to  Lieutenant Balk, the German officer commanding,their arms,  and were placed in  captivity by  German prisoners of war, who later onhanded them over to the Red troops.  The notorious Muravyev incident, which resultedin the retirement of the Red troops, happened  on  the  8th July.  Muravyev was thecommander of  the  Red  troops  operating against  the  Czecho-Slovaks.  He  was anadventurer,  and was  notoriously open  to bribery.  The Entente were  successful  inwinning him over to their  side.  Muravyev proclaimed not only his unity with the czecho-Slovaks, but also  at the same time war on Germany.   The purpose of thesemachinations was the fall of the Bolsheviks  and the incitation  of bad feeling againstGermany.   Widely separated synchronising actions clearly point to one source.     Russia  and Finland. News transmitted  through the  wireless  stations of theRussian  Government contains the following :-     The representative of  the  German Embassy at  Moscow, in  the name of  the Government  of Finland,  and  the  representative of  the  Councils of the  People&apos;s Commissaries of the Russian Republic have signed an agreement which  provides  as follows :                                ...      1.  All citizens of Russia and  Finland arrested for political  reasons in Finland and            Russia are liberated, including those who have been  accused  of spying and            conveying contraband of war.      2.  A chancellery composed of two Finns is formed in connection with  the German            consulate at Petrograd, and another composed of two Russians in connection            with the Norwegian consulate at Helsingfors.      3.  The frontier will  be open for Finns who enter Finland from Russia with pass-             ports delivered by  the German consulate, and for  Russians who enter Russia            from Finland with passports delivered by the Norwegian consulate.
    The Harvest. The Russian Government sent out the following wireless message onthe 26th July :-    From all regions of Russia information  concerning  the harvest is coming in.   in several regions the harvesting of corn has already started.   All over the country  theharvesting is being carried out by land communes, and the work is done in order.  the harvest generally is over the average, and there will he bread  for all in the towns andin the poor localities.    The more detailed information is that in the province  of Yaroslav the winter corn isquite good, and the summer corn is up to average.   Hay is very good, and fresh hay isalready in the market.   Flax is up to the  average, and potatoes are promising.  In theprovince of Tambov the harvest will be also up to the  average.   This province will havenot less than  25  million  puds to  spare for other  provinces  and towns.   In  theTsaritsyn region, in  spite of bad weather,  the harvest will give good results.  In theprovince of Nizhni-Novgorod the harvesting has begun.   In Ardatka the  harvest issplendid.   In the province  of Kaluga the  peasants  have begun  harvesting, and it isvery good.   In  the province  of  Kostroma the winter  corn is quite good.   In  theprovince of Tula the  harvest is of average quality.  In the province of Moscow it is alsoup to average.SIBERIA.     The Neio Government and the Allies. Mr. Hodgson telegraphed from Vladivostockon the  21st  July [No. 99] that  a note had been addressed  to  the  allied  consulsaffirming the desire of the new Government that the friendly relations existing betweenit and their Governments should be confirmed by the union of the military forces of all to face  the common  enemy, and that as soon as  might  be  possible.   The SiberianGovernment asked too that it might be informed as to the views of the allied Govern-ments in regard to the possibility of forming a new Russian front.     On the 26th July Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No.  83]  to Mr. Hodgson instructing him  to  reply to  the  note he had received by saying that the bringing about  theexpulsion of enemy forces from Russian  soil, and  the securing of the economic  andpolitical  restoration of Russia, without  any kind of internal  interference  or  anyinfringement of the territorial integrity  of Russia, were  the  aims of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.                                   ABYSSINIA.     Reports of Death of Lil Yasu. Sir  R.  Wingate telegraphed  on the 28th  July[No. 1144] that he  had  received reports from  more than  one quarter of the  death  ofLil Yasu from fever, and was awaiting confirmation from Mr. Thesiger, with whom hehad communicated.                                   PALESTINE.   -  Hebrew University. The &quot; Times &quot; correspondent telegraphed from  Cairo  on the27th July saying that the foundation stone of a Hebrew  university  had been  laid  atMount Scopus, near Jerusalem, on a site purchased before the war, the creation  of  thisuniversity being an important part of the Zionist programme ; professorial chairs wouldbe created for all the arts  and sciences and would  include  one for Arabic.  The laying of the foundation stone was attended by  General  Allen by, officers of the French  andItalian  detachments in Palestine, a representative gathering  of Palestinian  Jews, adeputation of  Egyptian Jews, and  the heads  of other communities.  Twelve stones,symbolical of the twelve tribes of Israel, were  laid, the first by Dr. Weizmann, the others by representatives of the  various branches of Jewish  life in Palestine  and else-where.   The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; publishes the following message sent on this occasionby Mr. Balfour:-&quot; Please accept my cordial good wishes for the future of the Hebrewuniversity on Mount Scopus.  May it carry out its noble  purpose with ever-increasingsuccess as the years go  on.  I offer my warm  congratulations to all who have labouredso assiduously to  found  this school of learning, which should  be an addition  to theforces of progress throughout the world.&quot;     Recruiting for King Hussein. General  Clayton telegraphed on the  28th July[No. 18] that recruits continued to enrol themselves in Jerusalem for  the Hejaz army,and that it was expected that there would be  a considerable number  at Jaffa, to whichplace the recruiting officer was proceeding.
                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Expedition to Khurma. Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on the 24th July [No. 1119]that Colonel Wilson had been  assured  by King Hussein that  no  aggression againstIbn Saud was contemplated, the expedition to Khurma being intended solely to  restorelocal order.  On the following day he telegraphed again  [No. 1128] saying that king hussein persisted in regarding Khurma  as  within Hejaz territory, and his  expedition,of which we had only scant information, had already left.     Sir R. Wingate fully appreciated the risk of  increasing the tension with Idrisi, andon that account had urged that the formal warning by His Majesty&apos;s government against  provocation should  be. conveyed  at once.     Before  leaving Jeddah Colonel Wilson had  impressed this danger  on the  King,and had received firm assurances  that only the  reoccupation  of Khurma was contem-plated, and that Shakir would undertake no operations further  east.   Since then the warning sent by His Majesty&apos;s Government had been delivered&apos;to the King.   .  Sir R. Wingate did not think that any further action was possible at present; wemust, he said, just hope for the best.     On the 27th July  Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to SirR. Wingate [No. 938] instructing him  to  communicate the following  message to  King Hussein, unless he  should seegrave objections to so doing ; instructions had, he said, been  sent to Baghdad for the communication &apos; of a similar message to Ibn. Saud : His Majesty&apos;s Government  noticeswith grave concern the increased signs of dissension between  the  two great leaders  ofthe Arab peoples.   It  believes  that these events are  the  result of the  actions  ofintriguers who endeavour to set the  leaders of the Arabs at  variance in order to help the enemy ;  but it cannot tolerate dissension between its friends, and must insist, onpain  of  its severe  displeasure, that neither party shall take  any action  likely to. leadto an open breach.  As a means  of  preventing an occurrence so  disastrous  to allconcerned His  Majesty&apos;s Government requests that  the  King of Hejaz will send  a conciliatory message to Ibn Saud through the British telegraph suggesting an amicableexchange of views with the object of arriving at a settlement of outstanding  differences.It is most  important  that each ruler should   know the mind of  the other.  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government having long  experience of the integrity of both is confident that  by a rapid interchange of views friendship and confidence would be restored.                                    PERSIA.    The Jangalis at Resht. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 23rd July [No.  640]that the Jangalis had attacked the consulate at Resht and the Imperial Bank of Persiaat that place on the 20th July.  The attempt  failed :  during seven hours&apos;  fighting wehad 50 casualties, whilst more than 100 of the enemy dead had  been counted.   Sir  C.Marling said that it had been necessary  to abandon the bank and the consulate  to theenemy ;  but in another telegram sent  on the 25th  he  said that  we held  the bankbuilding though the Jangalis had the  town  and were barricading the  streets.  Theconsulate and its contents had been burnt.   The roads to Menjil and Enzeli were open,but the Bolsheviks at the latter  place had refused help.    The Bakhtiari and the Kuhgilu. The Political Officer at Baghdad telegraphed  onthe 27th July [No. 6193] saying that the Bakhtiari road  would  be safe for the  next two years from Kuhgilu raiders, as their tribes had been very completely subjugated  bythe Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari, whose recent campaign had  been the  most successful formany years.   The success of this campaign  was entirely due to the assistance they hadreceived from us in munitions aud money ; the Ilkhani and the Ilbegi were both readyto co-operate with us to any extent.    Occupation of Firuzabad. On the  25th July Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 646]a message from Shiraz [No.  127] to the effect that preparations to attack Firuzabadwere being made by  the new Ilkhani and Ilbegi, with  whom Kawam was  co-operating.On the 28th he transmitted  [No. 646 A] a message from the consul at Ispahan conveyingthe news that  Soulefs forces had been  defeated  and Firuzabad occupied by Kawam.Soulet, with practically no following, had fleet  to the South, and was being  followed  bya detachment of Kawam&apos;s forces.
     Vossugared-Dowleh. Sir 0. Marling telegraphed on the 23rd July [No. 642] thatVossugh-ed-Dowleh was quite ready to take office, and thought that, his  appointmentcould not be delayed for long.  Vossugh had been told by the Shah (so he had informed sir C. Marling) that he had  not  been appointed Prime Minister because the Germancharge  d&apos;affaires had stated that his appointment  would be regarded  at Berlin astantamount to a declaration of war; but this obstacle would be  removed  if he couldinduce the  charge&quot; d&apos;affaires to make a formal disavowal.   Vossugh  had declined to do this ; but he  had ascertained that such a statement had never been made.                                   ARMENIA.     The Principle of Self-determination to be Applied to Armenia. On the 11th JulyMr. Ramsay Macdonald  asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if he  wasfollowing  the  resistance which the Armenians  were offering to  the Turkish armyseeking to overthrow the Armenian republic in consequence of the  declaration of thatrepublic that it would not accept the provisions  of  the Brest-Litovsk treaty regardingArmenia ; and whether the allied  Governments  pledged themselves to do everything in their power, when the settlement after the Avar came to be made, that the future ofArmenia  should  be  decided  upon  the  principle  of  self-determination.  In replyMr. Balfour said that His Majesty&apos;s Government was following with earnest sympathy and admiration the gallant resistance of the Armenians in defence of their liberties andhonour, and was doing everything it could to  come  to their assistance.  In regard tothe future of Armenia, he would refer the honourable  member to the public statements made by leading statesmen among the allied Powers in favour of a settlement upon theprinciple Mr. Ramsay Macdonald had indicated.     In consequence of this reply,  on the 14th July,  Boghos Nubar Pasha addressed thefollowing letter to M. Clemenceau :      I have just read in a newspaper that yesterday Mr. Balfour, speaking in the Houseof Commons, made a declaration in favour of the Armenians, and stated that they wouldbe one of the nations whose fate would be  settled by the allies in accordance with theprinciple of self-determination.     I  had been  impatiently awaiting this declaration, which I knew would, in conse-quence of the steps we had taken, be made  by the Foreign Office.     You  have always shown yourself  so  well disposed towards the Armenians, whomyou have defended, that this  must be my excuse for troubling you with a letter, in themidst of all your anxieties and your overwhelming business, to beg you not to abandonus in these hours of anguish.     Thanks to the Bolshevik treason, the Turkish Armenian provinces were reoccupiedby the Turks, and now the Armenians of the  Caucasus  have in  turn been crushedbefore English help could reach them, and have been forced to accept conditions, imposed by a conference  which met  at Constantinople, to  confine themselves to a miniaturerepublic, which, though called independent, will only be one of the vassals of Germany.     On that front there is but a handful of men, some 25,000  in all, survivors of the armenian massacres, capable  of  offering resistance, but they are  endowed  with the energy which comes from despair, and with a courage which commands our respect.     Of the 900  Armenian  volunteers  who joined  the French Foreign  Legion at thebeginning of the war, hardly fifty combatants are left; the  rest have been killed on theFrench front  after winning  glorious notices of their bravery and  their rare militaryaptitude.     Battalions of volunteers from Egypt and America have been formed for the EasternLegion, and are  actually en route for Palestine, where they will fight with the Frenchcontingent.  They started with enthusiasm, sacrificing everything in the hope of helping,side by side with the allies, to free their country.     But like their brethren in the provinces  of  Van  and  Erzeroum who are fightingfor their homes  in -this time of  distress,  they  needP as   indeed every Armenianneeds, a word  of comfort and  encouragement from France ; and it is just that I beg you to give them.     I ask that your  Government should seize upon, or even provoke, some occasion inthe near future to say that France, the  traditional  protector of the  oppressed, will not abandon  the  Armenians any  more than  she  will  abandon other enslaved peoples.(nationalites sujettes) ;  that she does  not recognise the  conditions  imposed by  theconference of Constantinople  or the  treaty of Brest-Litovsk; and that on the day of       [898-106]                                                        C
        &apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;;.;/           &apos;\&apos;\C;V;- 6                       &quot;i(;&quot;7victory she will have justice done to the Armenians by the realisation of their nationalaspirations.    Such,  my dear  President, is my humble request.   I know that I can count  on your sympathy for our cause and on your help, and I thank you in advance.    To this M. Clemenceau replied as follows : -    You recall the heroism of your  compatriots and ask  me  to take advantage of anopportunity to encourage them in their efforts, and to tell them that the terms imposed by the conference of Constantinople will  not  be  recognised by the  Government of theRepublic.    France,  victim  of the  most unjust aggression,  has inscribed  the  liberation ofoppressed nations in its list of claims.    Traditional protector of such peoples, she has  often shown her profound symapathy for the Armenians.  She has made every endeavour to help them.  v  The&apos;bonds which join  the Armenians to  France have been tightened  not only  bytheir  spirit of sacrifice,  but also by their  loyalty to the allies in  the  Foreign  and eastern Legions, and on the Caucasus front.  11 &quot;&apos;T am  pleased to be able to assure you that the Government of the Republic, like that of the United  Kingdom, has never done other than include the Armenian nationamong  the  peoples  whose lot  the allies intend shall be determined by the high laws of humanity and justice.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                  PALESTINE.     The German Colony. General Clayton telegraphed on the 30th July [No. 24] that,with  the exception of a few sick and infirm, the  German colony  at  Jaffa had been evacuated to Egypt [E.R. LXXVIII, p. 3].  Within a few days&apos; time there would be&apos; asimilar&apos; evacuation of the German  colony  in Jerusalem, with the  exception  of  certain persons (such as nurses in the leper  home) useful  to the administration, the sick andinfirm,&apos; and  the members  (forty-one  in all) of certain religious orders who were underadequate control.  In regard  to enemy charitable, educational, and industrial  institu-tions, those  which were catholic had been handed over to allied religious institutions;those which  were protestant  to the  board of control under military administration ;and1 those belonging to the Hilfsverein  to the Zionist commission.                                    ARABIA.     The Khurma Dispute [p. 4]. Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed on  the  30th July[No. 1150] some particulars  in regard to this matter. The  Khurma district, he said,was claimed by King Hussein  to be within his territory,  and apparently with reason :certainly its  chief village was  only 80 miles in a direct line from Taif.  Four  years ago,King Hussein appointed Khaled  emir of  the  district; and subsequently, acting underWahabi influence, Khaled renounced  his allegiance.   King Hussein sent an  expeditionagainst him,  but it was  unsuccessful, and  he considered that this reverse should now beretrieved.  There was no reason for doubting his assurance that  the expedition wouldnot  proceed  further  east,  or attack  Ibn  Saud&apos;s subjects.  Ibn Saud,  for his part,represented  King HussehTs action as  aggressive : he apparently claimed the Khurmapeople as his, but did not  state whether his claim was based  on territorial or religiousgrounds.
APPENDIX.   The Sudan and the War, with a Note on the Recruiting Question, by Captain J. E.                   Phillips, of the Sudan Intelligence Department.     MENTION has been made from time to time  both in the daily  papers  and inofficial reports of  the  satisfactorily loyal  attitude of  the  Sudan during the war to theBritish empire, its good services already  performed, and its  promise for more to come.At the same time a certain uneasiness has been felt in quarters fairly qualified to knowwhether the facts fully justified  the encomium.     The uneasiness is based chiefly on  the difficulty experienced  in  maintaining the sudanese units of  the  Egyptian army  up to strength, and the argument that the bestproof of sincerity in offers of service to the  British Empire would be shown by willingness to defend the  Sudan.     Without  attempting to offer a definition of  patriotism, it may perhaps be granted that it implies an active will to make such sacrifice of person and property as the goodof the state may demand.   Loyalty is, however, a more passive virtue  resting ratheron sympathy than co-operation.     The loyalty of the Sudan since the outbreak of war has been eminently satisfactory,and especially gratifying  to those who, after fighting the inhabitants of the Sudan asdervishes, have remained to see them develop into  peaceful citizens with  a  considerablerespect and, it may be, some affection for their British rulers.   It must not be forgotten,however, that the  strength of the Mahdi  had been his combination of spiritual reformwith  political revolt against the  tyranny of  Turkish rule, and that,  from the nativepoint of view, British  arms  were employed in the Nile expedition to reinstitute theTurkish suzerainty ; and though the system of administration introduced by the  Anglo-Egyptian Government was  recognised to have little  in common with the old Turkishregime, it was not  till the  outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey that thenative fully admitted that the connection  between the old and the new regime, both ofwhich he called without distinction the &quot; Turks,&quot; was finally and fully broken.     The chief leaders of native thought also  took the opportunity of the outbreak ofwar to enjoin  on their dependents and followers a policy of loyalty to  the Government,a policy which was accepted by the mass of the population  not so much out  of anyspecial regard for  their rulers, as from fear of  the results of any change of regime.The state of  insecurity that followed  the downfall of Mahdism, when neither  personnor property was safe, has not been forgotten,  and though there have not been wantingthose who  prophesied a change of Government, and  thereby caused some uneasinessamongst  their neighbours, the bulk of opinion was strongly in favour of the maintenanceof the present regime, and  avoiding  the risks to life and property that  a  change ofGovernment would involve.     So far, then, a passive loyralty may be attributed to the  Sudan based on materialrather than sentimental considerations.     As  the war progressed, however, opportunities arose for the native to co-operate with the Government.  In the Darfur expedition  the tribes marching with the  Darfurborder were called upon to produce a line of posts on  the frontier and patrols throughthe western desert. No  difficulty was experienced  in obtaining  the necessary  men,and the duties the posts were called upon  to perform were canned out satisfactorily.     Later the heavy demand for camels in the Palestine campaign caused an  appeal to.be made  more directly and widely to the native.   It was made to only a proportion ofthe population,  viz.,  the  camel-owning  tribes,  but  it  was  made  personally by thegovernor-general, and was based on the duty of assisting the British empire.     Unfortunately the orders for delivery of camels were cancelled almost as soon asthe arrangements had been  completed, and  though they  were  renewed  subsequentlythe flair had been lost and the matter became  a purely business deal with little  flavourof patriotism.     Some effort was made to push the cattle trade with Egypt  as a national service,but as the animals were in any case for the supply of  the  Egyptian local markets and-not for military purposes,  and as, moreover, the prices far. exceeded anything that theSudan had been  able  to  obtain before, it  is  hardly to be included amongst warservices.     Recently  the failure of the contractor to the British forces for the  supply of durrahas provided a more luminous exposition of the attitude of the Sudan to  the war.  The      [898-106]                                                         D
s  contractor was a Greek, and  there  was, from the first, grave objection  taken by the  natives to the fact, not merely that an alien should be allowed the opportunity to make  the profit inherent in such a contract, but  that he should deprive,  the  people of the  Sudan  of performing  a national service  themselves.    The  immediate  result  was  considerable obstruction on the part of native and other merchants who were jealous of  the contractor, aud on the part of the durra-owning natives &quot;who were unwilling to sell  to the alien.   Later,  when the contractor  failed, the  Government  called upon the  natives to make pood.   The time was short, and  difficulties of organisation had to be  met, but once the nature of the service recpuired was known, the response was striking  and  exceeded expectations.   Whether the  total  required  will actually be  delivered  depends chiefly on the date when the rains begin  and prevent  the  transport  of grain  from the villages to the rail.   But any failure to complete will be due to natural causes  (i.e., the impossibilitv of shifting heavy loads over wet cotton soil) and not to the will  of the people.       It appears then that the demands of the Government on the people for assistance,  in matters connected with  the war, have  been met in every case in as far as it lay in  the hands of the people, and  there  has been  in  at  least one  case  a  feeling that the  Government should have applied  to  them  in  the first instance  rather  than make an  independent arrangement, and this is especially interesting as  showing the beginnings  of some corporate feeling in the natives of the Sudan.       Conversation with natives on the subjects above mentioned, as well  as matters like  the subscriptions to the Bed Cross and similar funds, invariably elicit  enquiry why the  Government  does  not  state  its requirements more  fully ; and even  in the vexed  question of recruiting, a  subject that cannot  conveniently be  discussed openly with  natives,  there were indications that a statement of the Government^ requirements  would meet with response.  This does not  mean that the Government proposals would  be accepted without comment, as it  seems that  there are  certain  aspects of military  service as it holds at present in the Sudan  which make it inacceptable  to the mass  of  the population.  But the services rendered already, more especially in connection with  the grain. contract, seem  to show that a  fairly open discussion  of the needs of the  Government with the leaders  of  the people would obtain  the desired result, although  these same leaders might put forward recommendations for modifications of the conditions  of service to make it more acceptable to the people.       Suggestions have  been put forward from time to time for a system  of conscription  in the Sudan.  The chief drawback against this  is that any system  of  conscription  implies primarily an accurate census, a thing  which would be  very expensive,  very* difficult to manage, and of very doubtful accuracy when obtained.  It would take also a  considerable time.   It  would be, like &quot; taxing of the people&quot;  in  the  New Testament,  contrary to local custom and feeling, and would make the conscription that followed the  more unpopular.       The original Sudanese battalions were recruited from  the slave population of the  Sudan.   A considerable number of the dervish troops were enlisted  after the  battle  of  Omdurman, and these  were equally of servile origin.  The  abolition of slavery during  the last twenty years has meant that, the supply of this class of recruit  has practically  disappeared,  and though occasionally a certain number of men has been obtained by  patrols, and,  too,  the  families of soldiers supply a certain number, the  total is not  sufficient to keep these battalions up  to  full strength.   The  number  of recruits  that.  come from other sources is small.  The reason is  that except  under stress of extreme  hunger no native of the Sudan  will willingly identify himself with the servile classes  from which those battalions were originally drawn.  This applies equally to the free-born  blacks and to the Arabs.   Moreover, there is little doubt that the long service required  was a serious deterrent to recruiting.  Those units, such as the Camel Corps, which had  a short service have rarely found any difficulty in maintaining their numbers. Again,  there are very few natives in  the Sudan who have not got an ultimate interest in land  or property, and though they may be penniless for the time, they are  fully aware that  in the course of some years they are bound to inherit from their forbears their share  in  land or,  in  the case  of nomads,  in  herds, which  they will  then  wish  to go and  administer.   It is not  surprising, therefore,  if they show a disinclination to  tie them-  selvesdown to long service.  The transfer of battalions from one district  to another very  possibly remote from the home of the  would-be recruit is a further drawback, and there  are details of pay and  clothing on which modifications and suggestions might probably  be made.       It is not within the scope of this memorandum to draft a  scheme of recruiting.  The object is  to show that there  are  reasons for the present lack of recruits, and in the
I  absence of any  definite recruiting organisation which might have kept the militaryI  authorities in closer  touch with native  opinion on  this  matter,  little, progressivej  adaptation to changing circumstances has  occurred.  If the  contentions  previouslyj  mentioned are correct, a fair statement of the requirements of the country and  of the  duty of the people  of the Sudan to protect their  own  country should meet with an  adequate  response.   It would be an appeal to the people  of  the Sudan to protect the  Sudan,  and it would be a more definite expression of national feeling  than the  Sudan  has hitherto had either the  opportunity or the will to produce.  Such national feeling  as has  been  demonstrated to  date has been  evidenced  chiefly  in dislike of any  disassociation  from the Egyptian element in the Sudan, and  it is probable that a most  weighty argument to the native mind would be the formation of a Sudan army distinct  from the Egyptian  army.   Such a change, slight as it might appear to be in  its  initial  stages, would  be ultimately  very far-reaching, involving as it does financial and political  considerations of the highest importance, and although the question may be evaded in  the immediate future, it must  in the long  run become one of vital principle.  To take  a small and relatively insignificant detail, a  native  of the Sudan may easily demur to  taking an oath  of allegiance to Sultan Fuad,  a personality whom he  does not know,  though  he would be perfectly prepared to give his allegiance  to the Sudan Government.      In  conclusion there is reason to suppose that a declaration  of  its  requirements by  the Government would meet with response.   Hitherto but slight call has been made on  the male population of the Sudan, and the duty of defending the Sudan has fallen upon  Egypt&apos;as  represented by the Egyptian army.  If that duty is transferred to the Sudan,  it would constitute a claim to acquire both the duties and the privileges of citizenship ;  and there is some reason to  think that the natives will press this  point of view, more  espectially in as  far as it may involve dissociation  from Egyptian domination.  Since,  however, this  is in the direction of self-determination, which is the keynote of modern  colonial policy, it would seem the right policy for the Sudan  to institute a  system of  recruiting such as has been  adumbrated above with the consent and co-operation  of the  leaders  of native  thought,  both administrative  and   religious,  and  this  with the  consciousness and hope that it  would lead to development of a true national feeling in  the Sudan, and ultimately combine its many vanities of  tribes into a united political  whole.o
