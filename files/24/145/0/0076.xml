The following wireless message was sent out from  Moscow on 27th August : At  a meeting  of the  Moscow  Soviet  on 26thAugust Comrade Trotsky delivered a  speech on  the  military situation on our fronts.The following is a summary of the  speech :     The bourgeois countries  took part in  the late  imperialist war  during several years, and for many years  before that organized their armies in order to be able to fighta world war;  exactly the opposite happened with us.   History  forced us into a war,during which we began to  form  the Red army : all our successes and failures can be understood and explained only in the light of this fundamental fact.   At the beginningof August a year ago I left Moscow and set out for our  new and  ill-defended front.There, near  Kazan, our best workers, among them many Moscow men,  were doing their utmost  to unite individual detachments  in  one strong,  centralized,  firm army.   Thuswas our regular  army  formed, and we  at once immediately began  our  advance and obtained important successes.  Then we discovered  that fronts  were  necessary in thenorth and the south, and also in the  west,  after the  downfall of German  imperialismand the creation of a new  revolutionary perspective.  The  eastern front did its utmostat the beginning of  March  when Kolchak launched his  counter-offensive.   At that moment the &apos; workmen&apos;s and  peasants&apos; Russia, before all things the  Russia of theproletariat,  gathered its best forces and putting  forth all its  strength helped  theweakened eastern front to  rise to its feet again ; and at the end of April, seven or eight weeks after Kolchak&apos;s victorious advance, an advance which many considered would be fatal for Soviet Russia, we commenced a counter-offensive  along the  whole front andrecaptured all that had been taken from us.  We crossed  the Urals, we have alreadyseized a large strip of land in western Siberia; we have forced the Tobol and at presenthave advanced in several places for 70  or  80 versts.   Now we  can say  to  Kolchak,who is digging deep trenches: &quot; Dig them deeper  yet, we will  bury  you the deeperin them.&quot;    But at  present  our situation on  the southern front  is  very unfavourable.   Thegeneral difficulties  in Ukraina are far worse than those in  Great Russia.   The working class in Ukraina is still weak, because the  wealthy peasants there  are  very strong.The Ukrainan kulak (wealthy peasant) wishes to rob others  and collect money at his
own free will.   This, then, is the atmosphere of Ukraina, an atmosphere brought about by  the  outlook on life of the well-fed, brutalised kulak, who, rifle in hand, despisescommunism.   We are ashamed to acknowledge this, ashamed  to  think that in Kieffsoldiers are much less  well fed than in Moscow, Tver, Kaluga, and other towns.   TheUkrainan kulak will  not give up his bread ;  if we try to take it from him by force hewill defend it  with rifle, bomb, and other  weapons .... at present these Ukrainankulaks  of  the  western section of Ukraina and in the  south  are  under the  regime ofDenikin.   We  must-reckon how long Denikin will  remain in Ukraina ; he will, for his part, take  all steps to  disarm the Ukrainan  kulaks, and  in this way the gulf whichyawns between the kulaks and the proletariat, which has not been  politically organizedin Ukraina as in Soviet Russia, will to a certain extent be bridged over.   If we have anarmy, at present,  if  we  are not  standing  defenceless  exposed to the  pirates of allcountries, if we can  still defend  ourselves on the east, the south, and the north, wemust thank the sturdy workmen who did their  duty as representatives of the working class and as military commissaries.   All honour to our military commissaries !  . when we needed officers for our southern front we found  them.  After our  experiences onthe fronts showed us that there could be neither victory nor success without regular and plentiful supplies, we made a definite step in advance and established connexionswith the centre and the organizations and institutions of  military supplies, though i must acknowledge that, as regards the production  and  organization of work  in  thecentral department for military supplies, it  is not yet entirely satisfactory.   A  firmregime is  still necessary there.  Eight months  ago we asked ourselves whether weshould  not perish on account of  a  shortage of  soldiers&apos; boots,  overcoats, rifles  andcartridges.  Comrades, we have made  an important advance since then.  The Uralsare now in our hands.   We have recaptured the Ijevsk works, Perm (?*Motivilkha),Ekaterinburg,  Zlatoust,  and  the  whole road to  Siberia, with its inexhaustible  food supplies and  other riches.  If before  we  stood only  on one  leg, now  we are firmlyplanted on two one  in Moscow, the other  in Ekaterinburg; now it is a hundred timesharder to overturn us than it was six months  ago.   Comrades, I do not wish to deceiveyou with  false optimism, but  I will permit myself  to  say that our advance  has never been so ensured as at present, both on  account of our actual  strength and because ofour supplies.   Our advance will not cease  until we have forced Denikin back and havecrushed him once  and for all.  The fate of  Tsaritsin  is  sealed, since our advance is going  with full confidence and orderliness.   We have retaken Borisoglebsk and seizedthe station Povorino ; as you know, we  have  occupied  Valuiki  and Volchansk, and are within  60 versts of Kharkoff.  To-day  we learnt by telegraph that the Red troops hadtaken Pskoff.     North-Western Government. Telegraphing from Stockholm on the 27th August,Mr. Ramsay reported [No. 1300] that  a press telegram had  been sent from Helsingforson  the previous day in the following terms :      The interim  notes issued some time ago by the North-West Russian government,with the signatures of General Rodsjanko and Colonel Poljakov, will shortly be replaced by  new notes now being printed at Stockholm to an amount of 350,000,000 roubles.     England  has  guaranteed for  these roubles a rate of exchange of 40 roubles to the pound  sterling.  The notes will bear the signatures of General Udenich and  Lianosov.Their circulation will be obligatory in Russian territory.     Three months after the  occupation of Petrograd  the Bank of Russia will redeemthe notes against government credit  notes  to unlimited amounts, rouble for rouble.The new issue  is to be secured on the entire property of the Russian empire.     Admiral Kolchak  and his Gold Reserve. On the 30th August Sir Charles Eliotreported [No.  425 (sic)&apos;] that the representatives of the four powers had, at the requestof  the  heads of the military  missions, requested  Admiral  Kolchak  to move his  goldreserve to Vladivostock, and there to  place it under an international guard.   admiral kolchak said that if he had been recognised as the legal ruler of Russia he might havelistened to the proposal ; but, as  it was, he would not  part  with  his gold.   If anymisfortune should happen to him it would,  he said, be handed over to any new govern-ment the powers might fancy.   The most he would promise was that if his contemplatedoffensive failed, he would, on receipt of the news, at once begin to move the gold.     The  Omsk Government and  General Yudenich. On the 30th August Sir CharlesEliot also reported [No. 33]  that he  had been  informed  by the minister for foreign
affairs that his government (though it refrained from any expression of opinion as to the&apos;legal status of the government at Reval) had sent a million pounds to General Yudenichpersonally.                                  LITHUANIA.     Alleged plot in favour of Poland. Telegraphing from Riga on the  1st September[No. 64] Colonel Tallents reported that 95 persons had been arrested in Kowno on the28th August on suspicion of having plotted against  the Lithuanian government in theinterests of Poland.  It is stated that documents were found showing that money, arms,and ammunition had been received from Poland, and setting out the parts to be given tothe  military  personages.    Of the  95 arrested, 80 were civilians of  the Polonised-Lithuanian  landlord class and the rest Lithuanian officers.                                     TURKEY.     The Maintenance  of Order  in the Interior. On  the 27th August Admiral Webbtelegraphed [No. 1730] as follows :      The  grand vizier has constantly referred of late  to the question  of the lack of personnel for  the maintenance of order in the interior.     He particularly desires a reorganised gendarmerie under British officers, but he is fully alive to our close co-operation with the French  and to  the fact that in presentcircumstances if the allied governments  agreed to  any such measure the control wouldbe inter-allied.     General  Milne agrees that as we hold the Turkish  government responsible for themaintenance of law and order we should allow  it to maintain a sufficient personnel forthe purpose.  This General Milne thinks  should take the form of gendarmerie ratherthan of soldiers.  The strength of the gendarmerie  is much below its establishment, butit is undesirable in the present circumstances that recruiting should be permitted.     General  Milne  therefore suggests that deficiencies in the gendarmerie should bemade good  by drawing on certain  classes of Turkish prisoners, now in Egypt, on  their arrival  in this country.     I fully concur that the question  largely hangs on the decision for a mandatory  overall the  Turkish empire ; but meanwhile you will see the hopeless dilemma in which theTurkish government finds itself.  The  allies have no forces with which to impose orderin the interior and place the responsibility for  this  on  the council  of ministers, at thesame time denying it  all facilities for meeting those responsibilities.     I therefore suggest that a commencement should be made by instituting inquiriesamong  the  prisoners of war in Egypt as to their readiness to serve.     The Turkish  government service should be made  attractive ;  but details of this could be settled later  if the general  principle were  accepted, observing that the presentlack of money makes this somewhat difficult.     But I  wish to make it clear that if the Turkish government is to  be  expected tomaintain law and order, and if  this  is to be done by the gendarmerie, then the lattermust be placed under effective foreign control, that is  to say, under one single foreign power; and  this brings us back to  the  urgent  necessity for  a decision  as to themandatory.      A Message from  the Grand Vizier to the Peace Conference. On the 29th August Admiral Webb telegraphed [No. 1745] as follows : The grand vizier has addressed  to my colleagues and myself a  note enclosing a telegram which he wishes us to send to the president of the peace conference, pointing out that  the delay in making peace is stopping the working of the  whole machinery of government ; finances, justice, public safety (owing to the impossibility of reorganising the gendarmerie), and commercial industries are all alike suffering from the prolonged uncertainty.   Crowds of people, both Moslem and Christian,  have been driven from their homes and are  equally without  resources whilst the  winter  is  fast approaching.  His highness therefore begs that peace may be re-established at the  earliest possible moment.                                    SYRIA.      Memorandum  by Emir  Feisal. On   the  29th August  Colonel  French reported [No. 414]  that Field-Marshal Allenby had received a letter and memorandum from Emir Feisal  in regard to the position in Syria.        [760]                                                             .B 2
     In his memorandum, which is dated the 17th August, the  emir  asks why the restof Syria had not been treated  in  the  same way as Palestine, which had asked for and obtained a  British mandate which, however, would involve a division  of  the  arab countries and a return to the &quot;  unjust agreement of 1916.&quot;     A  mandate  for  all  Syria  and  Mesopotamia, granted to one power, was what hadbeen asked for by a majority of the Arab people.  If the peace conference should ignorethis wish and make*a decision which  involved the division of  the  country there wouldbe a general Arab rising; in which event he could not retain  his  present position, but would be obliged to shed the last drop  of his blood with his fellow-countrymen.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.    Administrative Record during British Occupation. The political department of the india Office has issued a memorandum on the British  occupation of Mesopotamia fromwhich the following passages are taken :          Introductory. The country to be attacked by the Mesopotamian expeditionary    force which  left India in the  autumn of 1914 was hostile to its Turkish masters.    There was a certainty that if our operations were successful the Arabs would detach    themselves  from the Turks ;  there  was a hope that they would attach themselves    to  us.  Accordingly, Sir Percy  Cox, who  by  many years of service in the Persian    Gulf had acquired a unique position and reputation in these regions, was appointed    chief political officer on  the staff of the general officer commanding.   On him    devolved the solution of the political, administrative and diplomatic problems which    resulted from the progress of  the  army.  Prior  to the occupation  of Baghdad,     Sir  P.  Cox  conducted his correspondence exclusively through, the general officer     commanding; in August  1917  he was given the title of &quot; civil commissioner&quot; and    was authorised  to  report  direct to  his  majesty&apos;s  government,  addressing  his    communications to the secretary of state for India,         Military Situation. As operations progressed, the military map of Mesopotamia     showed a base  at  Basra, a long thin line of communications on the Shatt-al-Arab     to  Kurna, and  thence  up the  Euphrates to  Nasiriyah, and up the Tigris to Kut.     At  a  later  phase the Tigris line extended to Samarra with outposts at Falujah on     the west and Bayubah on the east,  but for many months after the fall of Baghdad     there  were  no  troops on the Euphrates between the Hindiyah  barrage and     Nasiriyah.   The Arab is a notorious  marauder, and it was the policy of the Turk     to  make him harass our flanks and embarrass our convoys.   It was the work of     Sir  Percy Cox  to  persuade  him  to good behaviour and gradually to attract the     shaykhs and the cultivators to. an active appreciation of western administration.    Shortly after our  arrival in Baghdad  deputations  arrived  from the  Euphrates     begging the presence of a British  representative for the maintenance of inter-tribal    order  and the visible guarantee of  authority.   In the Basra vilayet districts were    formed and were peacefully  running while the fighting before  Kut was still in    progress ; within four  months  of the occupation of Baghdad  the whole of the    surrounding  country  was under  control,  representatives of government in four    instances&apos;Arabs were established.in district headquarters, and the tribes, many of    whom  were still armed  with  British rifles and  British ammunition,  spoils  of     Ctesiphon, were back on their canals busy with the coming harvest.  As  our sphere    of influence extended, contact was established with Kurdistan and Persia, with the     Arab of the desert  and the Arab of the peninsula, and to Baghdad were attracted    the refugee Armenians of Van,  Assyrians  from Julamerk and  Chaldeans from    Urmiah and Salmas, 50,000 in all, the feeding and contentment of whom has been    an added caie.         Early Administrative Problems. The administrative problem had two aspects,     rural and  urban ;  and the problem of the town was the more  difficult.   The     machinery of government had  been Turkish, the  towns were  cosmopolitan.  In     Basra even before the war the rupee was more current than the piastre ;  in Kerbala     Persian and Hindustani were  better understood than Turkish ; the population of   -  Baghdad contained  Syrians, Armenians, Chaldeans, Indians and Persians, French     nuns and Jewish rabbis.  The townsfolk, even the villagers, considered themselves    distinct from and superior  to  the  mere &quot;Arab&quot;  of the  countryside and desert.     The personnel of the Ottoman  government invariably fled on  our approach, and    except  at Basra were careful to  remove or  destroy  all records.   But the townfolk
expected government.   On our  entry into Basra, the  date  harvest had  to  be collected and disposed of; revenue  charges  were  due,  customs dues  awaitedcollection, litigation awaited settlement, property changed hands and legal sanctionwas required.    Machinery  of  Government. To assist Sir Percy Cox, Mr. H. Dobbs, I.C.S.,was sent out in  January 1915 as revenue  commissioner.   He found that in theBasra vilayet the land revenue demand was for the most part fixed, and other taxescollected  by farmers.   He  made  such  alterations  in the  contracts as equitydemanded, but  generally  speaking maintained the previous system.   He wasfortunate in finding the demand registers intact.  Waqf property was  regulated,an  education  policy  framed,  and  the work  of administration  was  graduallycrystallized.  He left in 1916  and was eventually succeeded by a, revenue board oftwo officers who assumed under Sir Percy Cox control  of land registration, land revenue, land settlement, customs, excise, miscellaneous revenues,  public debt andWaqf.  To these was added the duty of legal remembrancer.    With the advance to  Baghdad the revenue board for practical purposes splitinto two.   In the summer of 1917 the experiment  was made of separating theBasra vilayet as an administrative unit from Baghdad, the former governed by a deputy civil commissioner under  Sir  Percy Cox&apos;s  control, the  latter governeddirectly.  The  functions of the board were  somewhat  similarly  divided.   Asfacilities for communication increased it was found possible again to centralise, andthe two-vilayet  system was abandoned contemporaneously with the departure of Sir Percy Cox  in  1918 for Teheran.  By the  summer  of 1918  the departmentsunder the revenue board had grown to require a director at the  head of each.   In1919  the supervision of these  directorates was taken  from the revenue  board,which was abolished, and all work became centred in  the civil commissioner^ office,the secretariat of which combines the work which in India would be divided between government, the financial commissioner, and the accountant-general.  The districtshave been combined into divisions, and in each division a local advisory council  hasbeen set up.     The Administration in Working. The machinery thus created enabled settledgovernment to proceed pari passu with the advancing army, and to spread rapidlyon  either flank.  Political officers,  sent to act at first as intelligence officers withheadquarters in the field, were left  to open  political offices at the headquarters of former Turkish  districts, as the army advanced  beyond them.  They were visitedby the revenue  officer, who ascertained the agricultural  requirements of  the area,and made provisional  arrangements  for revenue establishment  and  collections.Recommendations were submitted for  the civil commissioners orders, and in a  fewdays business proceeded normally.   Thus, for example, though the Turkish officials had fled,  yet  within three  hours of the  occupation of  Kirkuk  an effectivemunicipality was created ;  within seven days revenue collections were  proceeding, arrangements for the restoration of agriculture were in train, and even an orphanagehad been established.   This was but one of many instances.     hand  Revenue  and  Agriculture. While we  were  still  in  Basra small agricultural loans were made to the shaykhs of agricultural  tribes.  Within four months of the occupation of Baghdad our  influence  was extended  to  the  cereal- growing country on either flank, and a scheme was put forward, sanctioned,  and carried through whereby by close co-ordination  of military and civil resources, over 100 canals were restored  to  efficiency, nearly 7,000  tons  of seed, and 2O,O0OL of cash were distributed as advances ; the staff almost  entirely local necessary to supervise and account for the detailed transactions was collected and trained,  and two new canals with  a command of 100,000 acres, designed by Willcocks, were constructed.  As a result,  the country, which the  year  before was restless and in the grip of famine, not only required  no  imports, but produced a surplus sufficient for the increased population  attracted from  starving Turkey and  Persia, for the 50,000 refugees at Baqubah, and for the supply to the army of corn, which by the end of 1919, had amounted to over 50,000 tons.  Wheat  and barley sold in 1917 at from 4,01. to  100L  a ton.  The present  price  is from  51. to 10Z.   At  a  cost of 21.000Z.  the  scheme produced  crops worth  over 2,00O,OO0L   The development scheme of 1917-18 was folio wed&apos; in the ensuing year by the formation of a board of agriculture,  the establishment of an agricultural  and an irrigation directorate, and the  co-ordination of  all activities directed towards the increase  of the food
supply.  Two new canals have been established and colonised, and new headworksprovided for the most important canal (the Khalis) on the Diyalah river, which,thanks to.. Turkish neglect,  was  threatened with complete destruction.  Riverprotection work has been such that never in the history of Baghdad have floods  of equal severity proved so harmless.     In all this there has been the closest  co-operation between the  military andpolitical authorities.               2$     Customs, Excise and other Taxes. It has  been found necessary to abandoncertain of the justly unpopular Turkish taxes-in particular the poll tax for roads,war taxes, and in certain areas the salt tax.   The provision of international law  tothe  effect that the fiscal policy of an occupied country must be maintained, hasbeen scrupulously observed.   Sea customs have proved a profitable  source  ofrevenue from the first;  and land customs on Persian trade are duly levied.     Education. Our policy has been  to  encourage indigenous schools,  to providetechnical  training, but  to open  government schools  only when teachers  of an approved standard are available.   Of  80  ex-Turkish schoolmasters who applied forposts at Baghdad, only five were  found suitable.  . A  training school for teacherswas also opened,- from which qualified  teachers are being recruited  for governmentschools.  There are now 20  missionary  schools  in receipt  of grants in aid.   a school for mamurs (revenue officials) and surveyors was established at Baghdad, andturned out 80 qualified surveyors  in its first year  of existence.   A self-supportingcommercial school  is proving  most popular.   The boy scouts movement has  been started, and promises success.     Present Situation. Up to the time of the  armistice the course of progress,both political and material, was -unchecked.  The people had  been  assured thecountry would not revert to Turkish rule, and they  took  it  for granted  thatthey would  remain under British  protection.  They had seen  our work in battleand in administration ; they  appreciated our thoroughness, our strict justice, and,above all,  our  rapidity  of  action.   Since  the armistice  tbe  position has notimproved.  The delays and uncertainties of the  peace conference have  had theirinevitable reaction upon  local opinion.   Distrust of our intentions and fear  ofthe  return of  the Turk  have been engendered.  . For reasons which  need not bediscussed here, it was considered necessary to invite the population of Mesopotamiato express their views  on &quot; self-determination.&quot;   They reflected that if they voted for the Turk and the British came, they would be none the worse; whereas if theyvoted for the  British and the Turk came, they would inevitably pay the penalty.Their open declarations in our favour were therefore the result of stable conviction.The continued postponement of a decision gives endless  opportunity for  agitation,while  it necessarily tries  the patience  of our friends.  Arab  hopes and fears  in syria also have had their influence on  Mesopotamian  politics.  The results are  tobe seen not only in signs  of unrest in  the interior of  the country, but  in actualdisturbances in the outlying districts, particularly  in Kurdish areas, where no lessthan three incidents involving the  murder of British officers have recently occurred.At the same time material progress on the previous scale has become impossible ;and both the agricultural  and  irrigation departments  are depleted of officers who  cannot  afford to abandon the certainty of  good employment elsewhere forthe  doubtful prospects which  are all  that Mesopotamia  can  at present holdout.   Already  men of  exceptional  experience  have been lost  to  the country ;Col. Garrow has gone to the Argentine, Col. Evans to Burma, and Col. Engledowto England.     There is also the financial aspect.   We are at present bound to accept Turkishfiscal policy, and a financial system which requires complete reform has to be madeto serve.  We cannot  inaugurate new taxes ; we have had to abandon old ones.Mesopotamia is to all  practical intents  and purposes  a separate state; yet  aproposal by the  civil  commissioner to introduce  a. customs barrier against the syrian frontier has had to be negatived.  Other sources  of revenue  that awaitexploitation,  e.g.,  rise  in land values, minerals,  and lease of state  lands,  must remain untouched.  The longer the delay  the greater the  political and financialembarrassment.
