On  the 30th November  Mr. Balfourtelegraphed to Mr. Lindley [No.  366], and  Sir Charles Eliot [No. 188] informing themthat His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed (1) to supply the Baltic States with militarymaterial, subject to the condition that there should be Governments ready to receiveand  utilise it; (2) to make  efforts to induce the Czechs to remain in western Siberia, and.to send selected officers to that region;  (3) to maintain for the  present  the occupationof Archangel and Murmansk as well as the present Siberian expedition ;  (4) to adhere tothe convention of December 1917 between Great Britain and France,  but, if possible, toextend the British sphere  so as to include the country between  the Don and the Volga by the convention Ukrania and Bessarabia were allocated to the latter as its sphere, theCaucasus and the  Don being the British sphere; (5) to establish touch with Denikin atNovo-Rossisk and afford  him assistance in military material;  (6) to proceed with  theoccupation of the Baku-Batum railway.     Critical Position of Foreigners. On the 28th November Lord  Kilmarnock trans-mitted [No. 3548] the following  translation of  a  telegram, dated the 23rd November,from the Danish minister at Petrograd, which had been communicated to him by  theMinister for Foreign  Affairs :      The proclamation of the allies, by which  they set the Bolsheviks  outside the  lawhas  rendered the situation of foreigners very critical.  The frontiers were closed yester-day and no more foreign passports are being vise.  We shall  therefore  be unable to evacuate our nationals.   A telegram has come from Moscow to the Commissariat forForeign Affairs forbidding  the  granting of a  visa  to Swiss  and Swedish diplomaticpassports.   The  Swiss legation,  which intended  to leave  Russia, will be obliged toremain.  I  beg you to inform the different  foreign  Governments, and to point out thedanger for foreigners in general and their nationals in particular which  will ensue fromextreme measures of reprisal against the Bolsheviks before the safety of foreign subjects and legations has been secured.SECRET.Turkey.

     Mr. Lindiey  on Bolshevism. On the  27th  November Mr.  Lindiey telegraphed[No.  465]  saying  that the  Italian  Minister  had informed  him  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had not yet replied  to  the  demand of the Bolsheviks  for  an armistice,presented to the allies through the Norwegian charge d&apos;affaires, and that he, Mr. Lindiey,ventured to offer the following considerations :      There is nothing new in the Bolshevik ideas of society.   They were expressed in thesixties of the last century by a certain Bakunin commonly considered an anarchist.  Anexact description of them may be  found on p. 319 of volume 2 (1905 edition) of Sir W.Wallace&apos;s work entitled &quot;Russia.&quot;  The book Lenin has written on the  subject can addnothing essential to that description.  It seems clear that no Government as at present constituted can safely have dealings with a body of persons whose object is to overturnthe  interests of  Governments,  especially of those whose  broad democratic base make them most solid, and who have (? shown) (that)  (? no) agreements they make  will beallowed  to  stand in their way.  The recent imprisonment of the  Persian minister at moscow because certain brigands from Turkestan  had very properly been incarceratedby the  Persian  Government, is an  instance of the kind of difficulty any government having  dealings with the Bolsheviks  must be prepared to face at any moment.   Thoughlittle sympathy need be wasted on this particular  gentleman who lost no opportunityof truckling both  to the  Bolsheviks and their German masters,  I would  venture tosuggest that advantage be  taken of the incident to  incite all neutral countries to expelevery Bolshevik agent-.     The principal reason  why the Bolsheviks have lasted so long is  their unlimitedsupply of paper money and I venture to recommend that particular  attention be paid tothis side of the problem.  This paper  money enables them  not only to pay their way inRussia, but to build up credits abroad, mainly  via, Stockholm, which are to be used toproduce chaos in  every  civilized  country.   It is  the  first  time  in history that ananarchist society has had  unlimited  resources, and  it  wrould  surely  be well for all governments to ascertain exactly where these resources are  hidden in their  particular countries in order that they may be sequestered at the proper time.  Incidentally this procedure would be strictly reciprocal  since the Bolsheviks have stolen all the foreign government balances in Russia.     The next step is to consider what  countervailing measures should be taken toprotect the foreign public from the effects of this mass of paper  called roubles.   would it not be possible to secure an international agreement to forbid all exchange operations in roubles until the currency has  been reformed ?   Such  a measure would have twoeffects.   It would protect Russia&apos;s  creditors  from  being paid  off in a currency  worthonly about one-tenth of that in which the debts were contracted, and it would  shakethe  confidence of  the Prussian people  in  the paper  they  are  receiving from theBolsheviks.  Once  that paper  were worthless abroad it should soon lose all value inRussia.  Special  exceptions might  be made in case  of Russians returning to the parts ofRussia  occupied by the allies until  a sound currency is introduced there.     I have made these observations because I  am absolutely convinced nothing is tobe gained  by having dealings with the Bolsheviks.   Over and  over again they haveshown themselves devoid of all scruples, and if  it is inconvenient to punish their crimesand rid the world of them by force, the only alternative, consistent with self-respect, isto treat them like  pariahs.     Persian Charge d&apos;Affaires Liberated [E.R. XCVI,  p. 1]. On  the  2nd DecemberMr. Clive reported [No. 3579] that the following telegram  from the Swedish legationin  Petrograd had  been  communicated  to  him : The neutral representatives  havereceived the following reply to their joint protest  of  the 23rd November against the arrest of the Persian charge d&apos;affaires : The Soviet Government, desirous of showingits goodwill to neutral  Powers, has  found it possible to  liberate  the  Persian  charged&apos;affaires ; but it calls the attention of the neutral  representatives to the  arrest of theRussian consul-general and his  staff at  Meshed,  in  contravention of the  elementaryprinciples of international law, and begs that they  will do everything possible to obtain their immediate release.THE  CRIMEA.     General Situation. On  the 30th November Admiral Webb [No. 71] reported thathe had been directed by Admiral  Calthorpe  to inform Mr. Balfour that  the situation in the Crimea was not satisfactory.  The constituted Government which  had hitherto been largely controlled by the Germans, which had not the necessary police or armed
  force to prevent disorders, desired the  departure  of the  German troops, and  that an)  allied force should replace them to maintain order.   The  presence of the allied  fleets  could not insure the observance of law and order in the peninsula;  and its personnel,  already depleted to provide crews  for a portion of the Russian  Black Sea fleet, was  wholly inadequate to provide the  necessary supervision  of the dockyard, the  arsenal,  and the stores at Sebastopol which were  either unguarded or in German occupation.  The batteries and fortifications  were neither  manned  nor guarded.   It was doubtful  whether the  German troops were completely  under the control of their commanders : * instances had been  reported of the disposal  by them of Russian and German arms  and supplies  to the disaffected elements of the population.  ESTHONIA.       General  Situation. On  the 28th November  Mr.  Clive  reported [No. 3530]  that the  military attache at  Stockholm  had received  the following  telegram from  Helsingfors :  The Esthonian representatives asks me to pass on following information :  The Bolsheviks have gathered near Narva a number of  6-inch cannon threatening to  bombard the  city if  the German soldiers did not surrender immediately ; wherefore the  Germans had informed the Bolshevik leaders  that they  would leave after three days,  when the Bolsheviks could enter  Narva and  Esthonia because the unarmed Esthonian  army was unable to resist.  In  the South things  also are getting  worse.  There are  very strong reasons for believing that the soldiers  of the  Russian volunteer army who  were holding Pskoff  have joined  the Bolsheviks and surrendered that place to them.  Evidently the German soldiers are getting more and more into touch with Bolsheviks.  The Esthonians having been robbed of their arms by the German invaders are in a very  critical situation.       On the following day Mr. Clive telegraphed again [No. 3555], reporting that three  delegates from the Esthonian provincial Government, who had left Reval on  the 26th  November and arrived that day, had  informed  him that  they had  telegraphed to  Professor Piip  in London the extreme gravity of  the  situation in  Esthonia.   The  Bolshevist troops had taken Narva, and nothing could  stop  their advance  on Revah  They begged that  British war  vessels should  be sent  at once  with sufficient arms.  General mobilisation had been ordered, but there was a  complete lack of arms,, as the  retreating German troops preferred to destroy  them to leaving them behind.       On the 30th November Lord Kilmarnock  reported that the Esthonian delegate in  Copenhagen had stated that the native army had been able to obtain 20 guns and some  5,000 rifles from Finland.   The Germans in Esthonia could not  be  looked  upon as a  fighting force; they were no longer under military discipline and had already destroyed  some 30,000 rifles.  SIBERIA.       Attitude of  the  Japanese. On  the  29th November Sir Charles Eliot reported  [No. 286] that the attitude of the Japanese was a cause of uneasiness  to the American  commander-in-chief and  the French  deputy high commissioner, both of whom believed  that they were  encouraging the two generals, Horvat and Semenoff, with a view to the  establishment of  independent administrations  in eastern  Siberia.  The French official  had stated that he had proof that General Semenoff was in constant  communication  with the Japanese chief of staff, and  that his proclamation against Admiral Kolchak  followed the receipt of a telegram from Tokio.   Sir Charles Eliot himself thought that  the Japanese undoubtedly favoured movements which  .tended towards disintegration,  and were trying to establish their influence in  eastern Siberia ; but he understood that  it was unlikely, having regard to the internal political situation in Japan, that prepara-  tions were being made for an immediate coup.   Horvat, Semenoft, and Kalmykotf were,  however, probably in the pay of the Japanese.                                      POLAND.       The Pogroms [E.E. XCVI, p. 2].-On the 27th November Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to Lord Derby [No.  2602] and Mr.  Barclay. [No.  7008]  instructing them  to  inquire  whether the French and United  States Governments would be prepared to support a  warning  to responsible  Polish  quarters  to  the effect  that,  if the pogroms  were not  stopped the prospects of Poland at the peace  conference  would be materially affected.  Reports from many quarters in regard to the  pogroms  had, Mr.  Balfour said, reached  His Majesty&apos;s Government, and they tended to show that  the disturbances were very  serious.        [898-124]                                                     B 2
TURKEY.     The Leaders of  the  C.U.P. Admiral  Webb  reported on  the  26th November[No. 39] that, according to information received from  two fairly good and independentsources, Enver, Djemal, Talaat, Nazim, and Behahatdin Shakir had all left on a Germantorpedo-boat for Constanza before the arrival of the British fleet : he was, however, in doubt as to the truth of the information in regard to Talaat.     The Neio Government and the G.U.P. On the 25th November Admiral Calthorpe ,i5reported [No. 33] that, in the course of conversation, the foreign minister had remarked&quot;that, whilst the  Government was  doing  its utmost-to maintain order and to loyallycarry out the terms of  the armistice, the members of  the late Government who werethe persons who had plunged Turkey into war with its  best friend were marking thingsas difficult as possible.  He spoke of them  with  great bitterness, and said that theywere working through the Chamber  and the press,  and had  thirty  million poundsTurkish to work with.     The Armenians  in Turkey. On the 30th  November  Admiral  Webb, reported[No. 77] that he  had  discussed the question respecting.the Armenians in Constantinoplewith the treasurer  of the American national  committee for  Armenian and Syrianrelief     It seemed that the greater part of the remaining  Armenians were concentrated inthe principal towns of Anatolia.   They had  now been  given liberty to return   to their homes, and many were endeavouring to do so.  But they were without clothing or food,and their homes were either in ruins or occupied by Moslem emigrants  from the balkans and Syria.   Even with good will, it was doubtful if the Turkish Government could ejectthese people, and certainly it could not do so without causing great loss of life, and,further, the returning Armenians would be more likely to be  persecuted.     So fir as could be judged, it  would be best to  endeavour to keep, feed,  and clothethem,  where they were  now,  through  the  winter,  and meanwhile to make  some definite arrangements for their return in the  spring.   The treasurer suggested  that if itwere decided to  establish an Armenian state in the  eastern part of Anatolia, whereprobably the previous  Christian inhabitants had  been practically extirpated,  it wouldbe suitable to urge all of them to move thither and not to their old homes.                                     SYRIA.     Appreciation of  the  Situation by  Sir Mark Sykes. On the  27th  NovemberSir  Mark  Sykes telegraphed [No.  14]  saying  that  his appreciation of the  politicalsituation of Damascus and the  Lebanon was as follows : Damascus and its district ispro- (?) Feisal but anti-sherifian.   Anti-French feeling runs high, and  to impose Frenchadvisers now would invite disorder.  The Government is working very feebly ; vitalityand cohesion are lacking, and intrigue  is rampant.  The practice of making occasionaldoles of money instead of  regular payments  weakens  and adds to (? the  insecurity) ofthe Government.   The prime necessity is the settlement of  the financial question forthe duration of the period of the provisional military administration. It is also necessaryto appoint  many financial controllers for  the  same period : Frenchmen would,  however,be  (? worse) than none.  Two  bad elements appear  to be  (? present), viz., the largenumbers of Turkish  officers and  too  much  Hejaz influence.  Both  tend to  estrangeSyrians, and  make the movement Islamic  rather than  national.  Beirut  and  the lebanon Druses, Moslems, Metwalis  or Protestants,  a fraction of the  Maronites,  a fraction  of  the  Greek  Uniats,  totalling  slightly  under  half  the population,  are(? amenable), and perhaps more  than half Beirut is anti-French in favour of autonomyunder Damascus  if Damascus is under non-French European tutelage.   The remainderare  pro-French- out-and-out  pro-French supporters  of annexation.   After makingallowance  for  previous happenings .(? the  bad) French  position in Damascus  andLebanon is due to (a) the French having failed to provide in the first instance an adequateor competent staff; (6) speeches, acts,  and propaganda, all tending to give impression that France means to  rule the country  directly and exploit it;  (c) the  bad  appearanceand alleged bad conduct, of the  French troops; (d)  a  general impression of hostilityof  the  French to  the Damascus Government given by  the   censorship attitude  of(? Martons), hatred of  the press, and the general attitude of French  officers; (e)  therepublication of Coulonclre&apos;s letter as a reply to the conjoint Anglo-French declaration ;(/) the triumphal departure of Feisal in a British cruiser.
    Without visiting Hama, Horns, and  Aleppo  it is  quite impossible to make any useful suggestion as to general  policy, except  that the  French have much ground  tomake good, which in these  parts they can only do by making some effort to show thatit is not their intention to annex or to favour minorities  at the expense of majorities.(?) From what I have seen, he continued, I do not consider that the French position is entirely lost in  Damascus or Beirut, but &quot;they have  only to continue on (? the same) lines to render hopeless  their chance  of a  predominant  position  without  having recourse to violence, which  I (? assume)  to be  contrary  to the  war aims  of the Entente.Mr. (?Picot) spoke to me of a  proposal that  the British should evacuate  the countryand hand it  over to  the French;  I  think  this  course  would undoubtedly lead  togeneral contravention (sic).  The hopes raised by the departure of Feisal (?) would, giveplace to violent irritation.   I am of opinion that the basis of the  present Anglophilismof Syria is nothing more solid than that the  French have made themselves unpopularand that the Arabs love to set partners (sic) by the ears.     Attitude in regard to the French. Sir Mark Sykes  reported on  the 2nd  December[No. 16] that at Horns the Orthodox and the Moslems were  strongly  opposed  to  theFrench,  the  Uniats  being practically neutral; that at  Hama  the  hostility  to  theFrench was  remarkable,  he thought  that,  should  French advisers  be  imposed,  the moslems would undoubtedly show general  passive resistance with sporadic violence,whilst the Christians, anticipating  that  the  old religious divisions  would again arise,dreaded  the advent of the  French ; that at Aleppo the hostility to the French  was aspronounced among the Moslems  as  in  other places, though it was  less among  .the christian population, there being a large percentage of Uniats.     Sir  Mark Sykes said that any attempt made, in the area where the Arab flag  had.been recognised, to replace British troops by French would invite trouble ; and, further,that the agreement in regard  to Mr.  Picofs position  was for  the present quiteunworkable,  as were the  provisions  relating to  European advice  in the  agreemententered into in 1916.     Armenians in Syria. On the 29th November General Clayton  reported [No. 205]that the situation of  the Armenians was serious.   There were some 85,000 of themconcentrated in Damascus, Aleppo, Horns, and Flama, and of that number nearly halfwere quite destitute ; whilst the total was being increased by large numbers driftinginto those towns from the villap-es.   It was estimated that  25,0OOZ.  a month wouldbe necessary  for the  relief of  the distress,  without  regard to  clothing and othernecessaries.                                    ARABIA.     Khurma. On the 26th November Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed [No. 1765A]that Shaker had reported to King Hussein that Ibn Saud&apos;s forces at Khurma had been reinforced by some 450 mounted men, under two leaders.described as Ateiba Ikhwan fromNejd.   In accordance with the  King&apos;s orders, with a view to avoiding bloodshed, Shakerdrew off&apos;his men after a skirmish.     Sir Reginald Wingate further said that  there  had been a^revival of  the reports ofaggressive intentions on the part of Ibn Saud ;  and fears had  been expressed that therewould  be  an increase of Wahabite proselytism among the  Beduin  when the  King&apos;spayments to them were curtailed.     Medina. [ER. XCV, p.  6, XCYI,  p. 4.]  Admiral  Webb  reported on the  29th November [No. 80] that he had just forwarded  to the high commissioner a telegram in cypher from the Turkish Government to  the  Turkish  military commandant at Medina ordering him to evacuate that  town immediately, in fulfilment of the armistice.     Prince FeisaVs Mission. On the 3rd  December, Sir Reginald Wingate reported [No. 1794] that the&quot;French mission at Beirut had sent a message  to the King of Hejaz to the  effect  that Emir  Feisal  would  be  courteously  received, though  the  French Government must consider his visit as  one of which  they had no official information. King  Hussein  should have informed it  previously, and  the arrangements for the  visit should have been made by its  representative in Syria.     A copy of this  message  was  sent by King  Hussein to Colonel Wilson, who  had - endeavoured to induce him to  forgo sending  the politely sarcastic reply he had  drafted, and to substitute for it a short message intimating that he had telegraphed a notification of his desire to be represented  by his son at  the peace discussions for the purpose of its
being communicated by His  Majesty&apos;s Government to the allies, and that therefore  he-regretted that the French Government should consider him guilty of discourtesy.     Sir  Reginald Wingate did not  say whether  King Hussein had accepted Colonel&apos;.Wilson&apos;s advice.                                     PERSIA.     The  Cossack Division. On  the  30th  November, Sir  Percy  Cox  telegraphed[No. 1017] in regard to our policy concerning the  Cossack division. &quot;  He said that thepresent commandant had stated quite frankly that  he regarded it as the one remainingbulwark of Russian influence in  northern Persia  and that he  felt he  had  a definitemission  to  uphold  that influence.   Moreover, he considered it his duty to  play apolitical  as well  as  a  military  role, and the distribution of  the  division into nineoutlying detached posts was primarily designed for  political purposes.   The commandanthad four authorities to consider, the  Shah, the Russian legation, the Persian - Govern-ment, and, for the time being, the British legation ; the result being that by playing offone against the  other he did precisely  as he pleased.   In any case  his allegiance was rendered mainly  to the Shah, who insisted on keeping him in Teheran for his personalprotection.    Sir Percy Cox was anxious to give the officers  of the.division full credit for  havingremained staunch to the allies during a period of difficulty for us and danger for them-selves ; but he had had  concrete experience of the  fact that when Russian interests or those of the division were opposed to  ours, the mere consideration that we provided theirupkeep counted  for nothing.                                                &quot;    If,  he  added, we were doomed  in the future as in the past  to help Persia,  thequestion  of the Cossack division would be  a  crucial one for us : and any changes whichit might  be  considered  necessary to  make  should be  made  before our  troops  left-Persia, as any attempt made later would, he believed, be countered by the division which, rather than submit, would  probably bring about a coup d&apos;etat with the connivanceof the Shah.o
