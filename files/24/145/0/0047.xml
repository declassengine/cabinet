To  the Governments of  Great  Britain,  France, Italy, Japan,  the  United States of America and others.     The Russian  Soviet government has  learnt by  a  press radiogram of a so-called invitation,  transmitted by  the Entente powers to all governments existing de  facto in Russia, to simd delegates to a conference on Prinkipo.     Although it has not received any invitation  to  enter immediately into pourparlers with this end in view,  the Soviet government, as it has already  often declared, is prepared to  purchase an  accord at  the cost of great  sacrifices, under the  express reservation that  the future development of the Soviet republic be not  endangered.     Considering that the enemies against whom it has to struggle draw their means of resistance solely  from the Entente powers, and that, as a consequence, these  latter are the only real adversaries with which it  has  to deal, it explains below  the conditions under which it would consider it possible  to make such sacrifices,  with the  view of settling all differences with&quot;the Entente powers.     In viow of the quite  special importance which (? attaches  to  the matter), and having learnt on this occasion also by press communications, that  the absence of an answer on its part would be interpreted as a refusal to reply  to this  invitation, the Russian Soviet government considers  it prudent to  explain its line of conduct, and to clear up  any false interpretation.   Further, in view of the erroneous  light in which its actions are  systematically presented  in the foreign  press, it takes this opportunity for defining its attitude with complete clearness and openness.   In spite of the increasingly favourable situation,  both from the military  and internal  point of.  view,  it attachessuch high importance to  the&apos;conclusion of an arrangament which  would  put an end to hostilities that it is prepared, bat of consideration of -the  fact that not  only  the  press,
but the  representatives of the governments of the Entente,  in  their declarations so often repeated, have shown that they  attach such  great importance to the question of loans, the Soviet government now  declares,  further, that,  in view  of the demands ofthe Entente powers it is ready to  concede this point.   It by  no means  refuses to acknowledge its financial obligations  towards those of its  creditors who  belong to theEntente  powers, the   method  of  raising  such funds  to  be the object  of  specialagreements,  the conclusion  of which shall  be  the aim of  the negotiations which it proposed to initiate.     Secondly, that in  view of the  difficult financial situation of the Russian soviet republic, and  of  the unsatisfactory state of  its foreign credit,  it  proposes,  by way ofraw materials,  which  shall  be specifically  stated  in the  agreement in question, to guarantee the settlement of interest due to be paid by it.     Thirdly,  in view  of the  grea.t  concern which foreign  capital has always  shown for the exploitation,  for its  own  profit,  of the  natural  resources of  Russia, it isdisposed to grant mining,  forestry, and other concessions  to subjects  of the entente powers, in accordance with stipulations which are to  be carefully determined in sucha way  that the economic and social regime of Soviet Russia be not made to suffer fromthe internal regime of such concessions.     The  fourth  point upon which it finds it possible to negotiate  with  the entente powers is the question of  territorial  concessions, seeing that it is not determined to-exclude at any  price from these negotiations the discussions of eventual annexationsof Russian territory by the Entente powers.  It adds further that in its opinion by&quot;annexation&quot; is understood  tbe maintenance in some regions formerly forming partof &quot;the old  Russian empire,  excluding Poland  and  Finland,  of armed  forces  of  theEntente, or forces maintained  at the expense of the Entente, or enjoying the military,technical, financial, or other support of these same powers.     As regards  points 2 to 4, the extent of the concessions contemplated  by  it  will depend upon  its military  situation  vis-d-vis the Entente  powers.   This  situation isat present  improving  daily.  On the northern front the Soviet troops  have justrecaptured Shonkursk.   Ou  the eastern front they have recently lost Perm, but theyhave  recaptured  Ufa,  Sterlintmakbelebej,  Orenburg, and  Uralsk, so  that railroadconnexion with Central Asia is now  in their hands.   On the southern front they haverecently  captured the important railway stations of Povordino, Alexikowo,  Urjupino,Talowaja, Kalatch  and BogutsChar, which have thus brought  the railway^s of  thesystem into their hands, whilst to  the south-west  of Lugansk  the Ukrainan soviet troops  are  advancing,  and  the troops  under Krasnoff  are threatened  in the rear.In  Ukraina  the Soviet  troops  have captured  Charkow,  Ekaterinoslav, Poltava,Krementschugtschernigow, Owrutsch, as well as a number of less important towns.     White  Russia, Lithuania and Lettonia,  together with  the large towns  of Minsk,Riga, Dvinsk, Mitau,  and others, are almost completely, in the  hands of the  soviet troops  of this republic.    As proof of  the notable strengthening of the internal  situation of Soviet  Russiamay be adduced the negotiations which have been commenced between the members ofthe  ex-constituent  assembly  and  the  Soviet  Government.   Its  representatives,Sakitnikow  (the  leader of its  congress), Svyatizky (the secretary) ;  Volsky,  Shimeleff,Gurewoi Tcherneukorf, Antonoff, and  all members of the  central  committee  of  theSocial  Revolutionary party,  met yesterday in Moscow,  and  they all emphaticallydeclared  that they were opposed to Entente intervention in Russia.  The improvement inthe relations  of  the  Soviet  government,  and the  elements of the . Russian societieswhich have hitherto been hostile to it  is shown by the change in the attitude of theMensheviks, whose conference  also  protested against Entente  intervention  in Russia,and  even the organ of the.....is appearing freely  in  Moscow.   The  generaltension [? tendency]  in  the interior is further shown  by  the doing  away, with  extra-ordinary commissions in the various districts.     Finally, as regards what the lying foreign press reports regarding alleged unrest in-Petrograd and other places, these reports rest upon a basis of pure invention.    The  Russian Soviet government once  again remarks that despite its  favourablesituation it is ready to make sacrifices in the (interests  of peace) and maintains its,proposal  to negotiate in regard to the above-mentioned points.    (2.)  To all.  The commissary of  foreign  affairs has sent  to the governments  of theEntente  a radio-telegram, in  which he announces that the  Soviet government is willingto begin  conversations  with  the governments of the Entente with the object  of the cessation of military  activities.
     The Soviet government announces that it is  willing to acknowledge its  financial-obligations with regard, to  creditors belonging to the  governments of the  Entente,,besides guaranteeing the payment of interest on its debts by,a Certain, quantity of rawmaterials.   The Soviet government is likewise willing to put concessions in the -mines,forests, &amp;c, at the disposal of the citizens of Entente governments, provided the social-economic order of Soviet Russia  is not  affected by internal disorders  connected  withthese concessions.     The extent to which the Soviet government is prepared to  meet the. Entente will depend on the military position in relation to that  of the Entente governments, and itmust be emphasised that this position improves every day.     On the principles indicated the Soviet government is prepared to begin conversationsimmediately on Prince&apos;s Island or in  any other place, and requests-the governments ofthe Entente to inform it at once where,  when, and by what route to send its delegates,     Bolshevik Offer to  exchange  Prisoners.- On the  9th February  Sir M.. Findlayreported [No. 382] that a note  had been  received from the minister for foreign affairsenclosing a copy of a communication  in  Russian addressed  by  the Bolshevik  ministerfor foreign  affairs in  Moscow  to  the  Norwegian  consul-general for  communicationthrough the  ministry  of foreign affairs in Christiania to the-governments interested.The  following  is  a  translation of this Prussian communication, which  is  dated the28th  December last:      The people&apos;s commissioner for foreign affairs requests  you  to communicate to theministry for foreign affairs in Christiania, for transmission to the governments concerned,that  the Russian Soviet government agrees to the freedom  of the  American citizenKalamatiano and the English mission arrested in Vladikavkas in return for the releaseof the  commissioners and  other prominent representatives of the Soviet authoritiesarrested by the allied forces at Vladivostok, Baku, and Blagovestchensk :  the  exchangemay take place across the fronts direct.     The Reported Nationalisation of Women. Mr, Alston reported on the 8th February[No.  143]  that  Colonel Barrow, chief of the  intelligence  division of the A.E.F., was convinced  of the authenticity of the Saratov proclamation.  From  the  evidence before him  [Colonel  Barrow],  it&apos;.seemed  practically certain  that, at  the   least,  groups  ofBolsheviks had sanctioned it.  For several months during the latter part of 1917 a memberof the American Red Cross medical staff was in Bolshevik  employ, and  he had statedthat the proclamation had appeared in several centres, and in one place certainly seriousefforts were made to carry out the prescibed plan.  This was at Tver, near Moscow.   i  Grand Dukes Shot  as Reprisal. Reuters agent reported from Stockholm on thelOth  February  that an agency message from  Petrograd  stated that   the  RussianBolshevist newspapers  confirmed the rumour that the  four  grand  dukes,  NicholasMikhailovitch, Dmitri  Constantinovitch,  George  Mikhailovitch, and Paul Alexandro-vitch, had been shot by order of the extraordinary commission for combating the counter-revolution. The grand dukes, the message added, were executed as a, reprisal for theexecution  of M.  Krylenko, the  late commander-in-chief of the Bolshevist army, whosucceeded  in entering the Cossack army with the object of making propaganda.LITHUANIA AND WHITE RUSSIA.     Spread  of  Bolshevism. Lord  Kilmarnock  reported  on  the   10th   February[No. 418] that he had received information from an agent to the effect th.it Bolshevism.was spreading rapidly  in  White  Russia and Lithuania,  especially among  the  Jews.The  movement  called  itself communistic, not  Bolshevik, and  fear  of the Polishgovernment and Polish  legionaries was  largely.responsible for its spread.  At Minskand Vilna the Bolsheviks continued their policy of mildness and  did  not interfere withthe carrying on of trade.                                           -UKBAINA.    The Proposed Conference. On the 6th February,  M. Rakovsky, president of theUkrainan provisional workers and  peasants, government  and. peoples commissary forforeign  affairs, sent out  a  wireless  message asking that  the  date suggested for theproposed conference at Prince&apos;s Island should be postponed in view of the very short
 notice given to the Ukrainan government.   M. Rakovsky also suggested Paris  as  the place  of meeting, the  success  of the conference in  its opinion  depending  on  the possibility of the  delegates being able  to  enter into  communication,with the political leaders of the Entente powers.                                     ;Ci SIBERIA.     The Proposed Conference. On the 4th February Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 144] a message, dated the 3rd  February [No. 127],  from Sir Charles  Eliot  reporting that Admiral Koltchak complained that his authority had been undermined by the invitation to meet the Bolsheviks and that his government was in danger.     On. the  same day [4th February] Mr.  Alston reported [No. 142] that, the decision of the  peace conference was  looked upon as a fresh blow to  Russia&apos;s pride, and, according to reports received from the towns along  the  Siberian railway, consternation prevailed amongst all classes of natives  and, with the exception of Americans, amongst foreigners of all shades of opinion in  regard to the proposal for a conference in Priuce&apos;s Island.  The proposal was  attributed to a lack of understanding of Russia&apos;s internal conditions and national life : and Russians asked whether the allies understood that  the armies  of Trotsky and  Lenin were made up of Germans,  Magyars, Letts, Chinese, and criminals.     The J&apos;apanese.-In his message of the 3rd February, Sir Charles Eliot alsu reported that Admiral Koltchak had informed him as to the Japanese terms for  help.   As  the. admiral said, the proposals were  simple  and direct.   They undertook, to  send an army to Western Siberia of sufficient  strength  to crush  the  Bolsheviks in two  months in return for the cession of the northern half of Saghalien,  part of Kamchatka, and  the control of the Manchurian railway. THE CAUCASUS.     The  Armenians of the  Karabagh district. Sir  Percy &quot;Cox  reported  on  the 6th February [No. :)4j that a telegram sent by the Armenians of the Karabagh district to the Baku Armenian  council had  been  commiudcated to him  by the latter.  The district in question is in  the province of Klisabetpol and has Shusha for  its.centre.   It was stated that the Armenian population  had been  surrounded  by the troops  of  the Azerbaijan government, and was being exterminated by starvation.  The Armenians were said to  be 300,000 in number, four-fifths of the whole population of the district.     Requests from, certain districts  for union with  Persia. On  the  3rd February, Sir Percy Cox transmitted [No. 85] a telegram he had received  from the acting consul at Tabriz, reporting the arrival at that place of  delegates from the Moslems of the four districts of Dera&apos;gas, Nakchivan, Sharus, and Orduband, who wished those districts to be re-united  to Persia.                                    POLAND.     The Elections. Renter&apos;s Warsaw agent reported  the  result of the elections  to  the Polish constituent assembly as&apos; follows : National  bloc  [in favour of M. Paderewski], 400 ; Socialists, 80 ; Jewish party, 15.     On the 7th February the &quot;Times&quot;  correspondent in  Paris reported some details. A.t Warsaw,  he said, out of 287,000 votes polled, the list of the National bloc accounted for 150,000, whilst the Socialists  secured  42,000, and  the Jews  74,000.  It resulted from this that  the National parties  obtained  10 seats,  of which  the first three were gained  by M. Paderewski, M.  Dmowski, and Mme. Balicka; the Socialists got three seats ;  the Jews four.     At Cracow the National  bloc obtained  29,000 votes, the. Socialists 20,000, and the Jews  10,000.     At  Lublin the National  parties  received  10,000, the Socialists 9,000, and  the Jewish parties 8,000.     At Lodz the National parties secured five seats, the Socialists and Jews twoapiece, and the Germans one.                                           -     Spread of Bolshevism. On  the 10th February  Lord  Kilmarnock, telegraphingfrom Copenhagen [No. 4IS], reported that  he  had been informed  by an  agent thatBolshevism was making great progress in Poland, especially among the Jews.
     Hostilities in Posen.-On the 8th February Colonel &quot;Wade reported [No.  72]  that he bad been informed by the Polish foreign office that, in spite of the endeavours made by the national council to bring about  peace, there was a continuance of hostilities in Posen.  The  Germans rejected a proposal for  a  truce  made by the  Polish delegates, and demanded the previous demobilisation of all Polish troops in the province, which could  not be agreed to as it would have meant the exposure of the Polish population to further  plunder  and  outrages.   The  Polish army,  however, maintained the defensive attitude which it had  adopted  at the commencement of hostilities  and had since maintained.                                     TURKEY.     Demand for the  Surrender of certain Officials. On the 5th  February  Admiral Calthorpe  reported [No.  248, received the  9th  February] that on the  1st February a preliminary  list  containing  the  names  of twenty-three  individuals,  charged with ill-treatment of and cruelty to  British prisoners of war,  was presented  to the Turkish government,  with  a  demand  that  those  individuals should be surrendered to  the British military authorities.  Further lists  would, Admiral Calthorpe  added, be sent in as the guilt of individuals was established.     Feshid  Bey [E.R.,  No. CVI,  p. 7].-On  the  9th February Admiral  Calthorpe reported [No. 289]  that Reshid Bey had committed  suicide, after recapture.     General Allenby&apos;s Orders. On the  9th February Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No. 288] the following telegram from General Allenby:      I arrived at Constantinople  on the morning  of the 7th February, and made an official entry at 10  A;.M.   In  the afternoon I received the Turkish ministers of foreign affairs and war, in the presence of the high commissioner, and informed them  that the conditions given below were to be carried out at once in area under the command of my force.  I idlowed  no argument or discussion  of these conditions by them.  The conditions were as follows :       1.  Ali Ishan, GO.C. 6th army, to be [? remove]d.     2.  The &quot;6th  army to be disarmed, and its guns, machine-guns,  and rifles to be handed to me at an  appointed place.     3.  The inhabitants will be disarmed when ordered by me.         .     4.  Such Turkish gendarmerie in areas under my control as are not required by me will be disarmed and demobilized under my  orders.                                ; -     Turkish gendarmerie in areas  [? not] under my control to be directly demobilized under  my orders.     5. Such Turkish  officials as are  reported unsatisfactory will be removed by my orders.  The  names of officials to  replace these  are to be submitted  to  me for my approval.     6. Armenians  will be repatriated by me when this is desirable.  Their houses; lands and property are to be restored now.     Facilities shall be given for my officers to visit  any places to assist in repatriation, and to estimate cost of damage done to property of Armenians.     7.  At my discretion I  shall arrest  any persons charged with crimes, and  any persons charged with conduct likely to cause agitation and disquiet.     8.  I shall control  all  railways east of Konia.     9.  I  shall control all   telegraphs  and  telephones in area  under my  control. No Turkish cipher telegrams will be accepted.     10.  I  propose to repatriate troops of the disbanded 6th  army at the rate of 900 a week, commencing on [a date to be arranged later].     11.  Turkish  authorities to  surrender all  [? deserter&quot;js,  including  those of  our Indian army.     12.  It must be understood that I  have the power to occupy any place I wish.                                     ARABIA.    Emir Feisal at the Peace Conference. On  the  6th  February Mr. Balfour reportedthat the case  for the Arabs had been presented  at that day&apos;s meeting of the peaceconference by Emir Feisal.    He claimed the right of the Arabs to retain the  independence which they had won,and in  support of  his claim described the  part which had been played by them in the
 war under British  command, in which  the Hejaz troops were supported by the entire manhood of the Arab population of Arabia, of Mesopotamia, and of Syria.     He pleaded that the different branches of the Arab race should remain in economic contact with  each  other, even  if they could not form one political entity ;  and in order that  their true wishes might  be  known, he advocated the despatch of an inter-allied-   .* communication to ascertain them.     The Hejaz Subsidy. On the 11th February the Foreign Office informed [No. 191] Sir Milne Cheetham that  there  was a likelihood of the amount of the subsidy for  March being  reduced, though  the  Treasury had  authorised the payment of 120,0001. for thepresent month.YEMEN    The Surrender of Turkish Commanders. The Foreign Office instructed admiral calthorpe  on  the 9th February [No. 256] to ask the Turkish government to despatchofficers to  supersede the  corps and divisional  commanders  in the Yemen with strictorders to arrange for immediate surrender, it having  been  reported by the officer in command at Hodeida that those commanders were not expediting  their arrangements.                                MESOPOTAMIA..    Chinese Immigrants. On the 4th February the political officer at Baghdad, havb gin mind the possibility of the question  of the rights of  communities  to imposeimmigration restrictions being dealt with at the peace conference, reported that some ofthe Chinese who had been imported into Mesopotamia in large numbers during the war,for military labour  purposes, were  showing signs of settling down  in Basra, whilstothers who were at  Bombay wished  to  enter the country.   There would, he said,doubtless before long be a demand for immigration restrictions in their regard, as therewas considerable local prejudice  against them.                                    PERSIA.    The Shah tvishes  to  visit  Europe. On the 6th February Sir Percy Cox reported[No. 96] that the Shah wished to visit Europe.   He undertook to  give the cabinet lullpowers, and to make no change  in it.   He  asked for the co-operation of His Majesty sGovernment, and for a continuance of his subsidy during  his  holiday.   The  primeminister and Akbar Mirza believed in his sincerity.O
