On  the  21st June ColonelRobertson transmitted [No. 557, received 28th June] a message sent from  Omsk bySir Charles Eliot on the 16th June.     In this Sir Charles reported that the minister of foreign affairs  had discussed withhim;  at considerable  length,  the second joint  note from the allies, which  had  been handed to Admiral Kolchak on the  previous  day.   The  minister  had pointed  out thestudied avoidance of the word  recognition   It was  clear to him, Sir  Charles Eliot, thatthe Omsk government was greatly disappointed at there being no definite  statement inregard  to  recognition, and he understood the difficulty in which they  were  therebyplaced.     No proclamation  dealing with the new attitude of the allies which did not containthis word would give satisfaction  ; for it would be thought that the  allies were not atall  reasonable in withholding it.  The  people  hardly knew why they were  fightingagainst the Bolsheviks, or indeed what they  were fighting for : and if  they could be told that  they were  fighting for a  government which had been  recognized by  thepowers as being suitable for all Russia, something would have been gained.     The minister for foreign  affairs  further  said that  his government  knew  next to nothing of our relations with Generals Yudenich and Denikin, and even what they knewof the advance of our  troops  in  Siberia  was known  unofficially; he wanted  to  knowwhether the Omsk  government would in the new  circumstances be in  a. position todiscuss, with the allies, matters of general Russian  policy,  military and other.   having in view the possibility that the military situation would not be  materially changed tillafter next winter, he said  too,  that  the following questions had suggested themselvesto  him:  (1)  Could Russia obtain  a loan from  the powers?   (2) Would there be  a continuance of supplies of ammunition and equipment?   (3)  Would  his government berequired as heretofore to  pay cash for such supplies, or would  it be given credit, andwould all the  powers contribute to them ? (4) Could they count on  foreign troops forguarding the  railway and garrisoning the Far East ? (5)  Would the powers be willing todiscuss a general plan  of military action with them ?
      Admiral  Kolchak and  General  Yudenich. On the  24th  June  Lord  Curzon   ^ instructed [No. 433]  Sir  Charles  Eliot  to obtain the written  sanction of  Admiral  &apos;.v Kolchak to the terms of the agreement which had been concluded between the Finnish government and General yudenich on behalf of the Russian provisional  government of the north-western front.      The Exchange of Prisoners with the Soviet Government. On  the 26th June  Lord Curzon instructed  [No. 936]  Lord  Derby to  have the following message  sent  by wireless to Mr. Chicherin, commissary for foreign affairs, Moscow : &apos;      With reference to your radio of 10th  June it  is quite impracticable  for me to arrange  an exchange  on  the basis of  all the  allied military  prisoners against the Russian Red military  prisoners in the hands of the allied governments, because  his majesty&apos;s government has  no power to negotiate for the  exchange of prisoners not in its  own  hands.   On  humanitarian  grounds,  however, it is  clear that  the recent exchange of Messrs. Raskolnikoff and Nimck  for a number of British  subjects was a good thing and that something further should now be done.  The  following course is suggested :       (a.)  The exchange of all  British military and naval prisoners, officers and  men, against an equivalent number of Russian Red military and naval  prisoners, or Russian supporters of the Soviet  government  now prisoners in  the hands of his  majesty&apos;s government.   I understand negotiations  for a partial exchange ar*e going- on between the Soviet commander and British G.O.C. at Archangel.      (6.)  That you should  give permission for any other British subjects, who desire to do so, to leave  Russia in return for permission for any other Russians in the hands of his majesty&apos;s government, who desire to do so, to return to Soviet Russia.      As regards (b), your radio of the 10th  June says no  progress can be made unless the Soviet government is allowed to send to London or some neutral country a commis- sion enabled to get into touch with Russians in Great Britain, to receive their complaints, and to inquire into their position.   I cannot agree to a commission formed of Russian supporters of the Soviet government  coming to the United  Kingdom for this purpose ; but  I will agree to allow  some Swiss citizen, or some Norwegian, Danish, or Swedish subject with proper qualifications to come here as soon as possible  and to get into touch with all Russian supporters of the Soviet  government referred to in (b) above, if you will immediately carry into effect the proposed exchange at Archangel of forty-three on each side, and will also immediately proceed to the exchange of the British military and naval prisoners, both officers and men, who would still remain in the hands of the Soviet government.      In order to  effect to  (b),  mentioned above, the  Swiss  citizen or the  Norwegian, Swedish, or Danish subject would have  to be a person of the very highest standing, and his name would have to be agreed upon between us.                                     POLAND.      The  Atrocities  in Eastern  Galicia. On the 23rd  June Sir  Percy  Wyndham reported to Mr. Balfour that a commission  had  been sent to  Eastern  Galicia by the Polish government and diet for the purpose of making an inquiry into  the atrocities which  had been committed in that district.  The Polish diet had made an urgent request that the commission should be  assisted  by representatives  from the American, British, and French legations: and he thought that the request should not be ignored.                                     TURKEY.      Changes in the Cabinet. Admiral Calthorpe reported  on the 29th June [No.  1358] that Ali Kemal Bey and Shevket Torghut Pasha  had resigned their positions in  the cabinet : the latter had been minister of war, and the former minister of the interior. The  resignation of Torghut Pasha  might  be regarded as set off against  that of Ali Kemal, but the reasons for it were not clear.  The  acting grand vizier professed to hope that he could fill the vacancies without a military crisis.      Simultaneously with  the  announcement  of these  resignations  Sadik  Bey had published a statement to  the effect that the Entente Liberale party, of which he was president, had dissociated  itself from the government: he persisted  in  regarding  Ali Kemal and [?] the grand vizier as subservient to French interests, and was now making a determined bid for power with the  avowed object of pursuing an &quot; English policy.&quot;
    The Greeks  in the Smyrna  district.  On the  26th  June  Admiral  Calthorpetransmitted [No. 1335] a message sent from Smyrna two days previously by Mr. Morgan,who reported that damage had been done to Italian property when the Greeks  lootedthe town, and that  [? British] claims would amount to not less than  20,000Z. sterling.In regard to Major Carosini [E.B. CXXVT, p. 5], though  the Turkish gendarmerie hadbeen disarmed and its offices  robbed, he had not been ill-treated.  Italians had  had toendure threats and  insults from the Greek soldiers and population ever since the Greekoccupation  ; and the Maltese, in spite of  their  declarations  of British nationality, hadbeen  similarly insulted.   The Government  had  issued proclamations  regarding the maltese but they had remained a dead letter.    Telegraphing again on the 29th  June [No.  1356]  Admiral Calthorpe said that,judging by all the reports which had reached  him, the  atrocities  in the Aidin vilayetcommitted  by Greeks  and Turks  should be about equally  divided  between  the two.The Turks, however, were mainly under the  influence  of fear, and therefore,  in his judgment,  at  present the more dangerous : and this  was equally true  of Thrace, the black Sea coast, and Constantinople itself.     On the 29th June Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No. 1360] the following message,dated the 23rd June, received from Commodore Fitzmaurice : -     The present situation is  as follows.   The Greek troops suddenly evacuated  Nazillion the night of the 19th June, without making any preliminary announcement (in spiteof the fact that they  had been  specially warned as to this) and  also without theknowledge of the Greek general officer commanding.     The 20th Juue was spent by  brigands  and some elements of the town in lootingabout 400  Greek and  Turkish houses: 15 Greeks were wounded and 10 killed.  an endeavour  was made by the Turkish upper classes  to stop the looting and to protect the greeks.  Turkish troops [? arrived on]  the 21st June, and having restored order setout in pursuit of the brigands.   Orders were given for the loot to be returned.     My representative  has  visited Denizili, Aidin, and Nazilli and has  warned theTurkish authorities at  the  last-mentioned place that  they  will be held  responsiblehenceforth for the  maintenance of order : they complained, that they had received nowarning of the evacuation.   He reports that perfect order prevails [? between] Deniziliand Nazilli.  A  force threatens Aidin, but the commanding officer  has  been warned that no attack must be made.  Several villages between Aidin and  Nazilli have beenplundered  and  the inhabitants killed; notably Germsha and Creeosk, the former byBashi Bazouks and the latter by the Greek troops during their retreat.     The railway is intact although attempts  have  been made to damage  it and the telegraph line.  I consider that if the Greeks are kept to the Smyrna sanjak, and theTurks know this, there will not be much further trouble.     Request for English Officers  to be  attached to Greek Headquarters. On  the 28thJune [No.  1353] Admiral Calthorpe reported  that the  Greek high  commissioner had asked that English officers might be attached to the headquarters of the Greek army ofoccupation in Asia Minor, in order that  it might be possible to establish the truth bytheir impartial evidence and  so prevent the formation of  more calumnious accusations inregard to the number of Turks killed by the Greek troops, of which he had already had reason to complain.      Alleged Massacre of Moslems by Christians. On the 30th June Admiral Calthorpetelegraphed TNo. 1363] the  following  paraphrase of a message, dated  the 29th June,from Mr. Morgan :       It is  reported by the vali ....  that on the 28th June  the Christians of Vourlaand  Sivri  Hissar were pillaging  and  killing  the Moslems of Effenchukur,  westwardand southwards from Smyrna, and also those of the neighbouring villages.                            SYRIA AND PALESTINE.      Hie  American  Commission. On  the  20th  June General   Clayton  reported[No. 351, received  the 29th  June] the  arrival  of  the American commissioners.   they reached Jaffa on the 10th  June and remained  there  three days.  They then proceeded to Jerusalem, where they proposed to remain ten  days.  They would then visit Haifa,Nazareth,  Damascus, Beirut, and perhaps other places : they  expected to complete their work by the 15th July.
     The commissioners, he said, had issued a statement setting out that the Americansection of the international commission, proposed  by the peace conference, had comewith  a view of ascertaining, for  the  information of  the  American nation  and itspresident, the desires of all peoples and  sections.     Emir Feisal and the Question of a Mandate for Great Britain. -Telegraphing to&quot;&apos; VLord Curzon on the 25th June [No. 1092J, Mr. Balfour  said, in regard to  Emir Feisafs   &apos;message reported by General Allenby [No. 2536] on the 15th June [E.R. No. CXXVI,p. 6], that apparently the emir thought that if the American  commission advised  thatthe people of Syria wanted the British government as mandatory, in  spite of  that governments reluctance, the mandate would be accepted.   This was  a mistaken view :in no  circumstances (as  he believed Feisal had  been informed) would  Great Britainaccept a mandate.  It was all important that Emir Feisal should be made to understandthat, whatever else might happen, Great Britain must  refuse to take any leading  partin the  control or  guidance of Syria,  though  she  earnestly desired to  support bothhimself and the Arab cause.  There was no -question of an  abandonment  of him or it:but we could  not  add the responsibility of being a mandatory for Syria to the otherresponsibilities we had undertaken on behalf of the  Arab race, and Feisal was perfectly well acquainted with the reasons for this.    Emir Feisal and the Independence of Syria.- On the 26th June Colonel French,telegraphing [No.  362] from Cairo, reported, that,  at the  present time,  there was nofeeling  against  Great Britain in  Syria.   Emir Feisal  had  been  led  to adopt hisprogramme for complete  Arab independence by his knowledge of French propaganda and  his fear of a mandate being given to France.   The commander-in-chief would bein Damascus before long,  and when there would impress on the emir the  importance ofrestraining the activities of  his agents :  but he had already been repeatedly cautionedagainst political  propaganda.                                    ARABIA.    Ibn  Saud and  King Hussein. On the 26th  June  General  Allenby  reported[No. 1038] that a message had been  sent to Ibn  Saud informing him that unless heforthwith withdrew his forces from  If ejaz and the  Khurma area he would be regardedas having assumed a definitely hostile  attitude towards the  British government, andthat the  result  of this  would be the forfeiture of all  advantages given by the  1915treaty and the immediate loss of his subsidy.  Ibn  Saud  had, General  Allenby  said,acknowledged the receipt of this warning.     On the 25th June General Allenby had  transmitted [No. 1029]  the  translation ofa letter he had received from Ibn Saud.  [There is nothing to show whether that letter was written before or after the receipt of the British ultimatum.]   In  the  course of thatletter  Ibn Saud said  that his greatest  desire was  to satisfy his majesty&apos;s government,and that he was setting out  for bis own country;  King Hussein  was in  no danger ofharm from him so long as  he stayed in his own  kingdom, but should  he make  anyaggressive advance  against  Nejd,  he,  Ibn  Saud, would  not be responsible for theconsequences.     In regard to  Mr. Philby&apos;s mission, on  the 22nd  June General  Allenby reported[No. 1015j that he had sent letters to Ibn Saud and King  Hussein,  informing them ofthe intention to despatch it.     Three days later he reported [No. 1023] that King Hussein had sent a long letterto Colonel.Wilson (Jeddah), saying that he  did not consider the present  a proper  timefor arbitration,  as Ibn  Saud  had actually appointed a  governor of Tarabah.   Hethought it  unnecessary   that anyone  should  be sent  to  Ibn  Saud, and urged  thecontinuance of written  negotiations.   Colonel Wilson  gathered from this that king hussein was strongly opposed to Mr. Philby&apos;s mission,  but he, General Allenby, was still of opinion that it should, be sent.
