On the  6th  Novemher Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 215] a message  dated the  2nd November, from the consul at Omsk  notifying that  an agreement had been arrived at with the Siberian Government,  and a working cabinet formed with&quot; M. Bologodski as president of the Council.     On the  10th November he transmitted [No. 224] a message  from the high commis- sioner sent from Irkutsk on the 6th November.   Sir Charles  Eliot  reported that the new ministry had been well received.   It  was, he said,  composed of more conservative elements than the directorate in which the Social Revolutionists had a majority of one. The scheme appeared to him to be a serious attempt to reunite Russia.                                     POLAND.     Capture  of  Cracow. Telegraphing  from   Amsterdam on the  7th  November, Reuters  agent reported  that,  according to an account  of the  capture  of.  Cracow by Polish  legions, published in  a Warsaw telegram  to the  &quot;Berliner  Tageblatt,&quot;&apos;Commander Roja., at the  head of a small detachment of troops, had entered the town and occupied the guard-rooms, afterwards marching with  the Austrian guards  to the barracks, where the Austrian emblems had been immediately taken down.  Commander Roja then went to the officers&apos; mess, where  the Austrian generals were holding a council. He informed them that  he had assumed  supreme  command, declared that non-Polish officers would be discharged the service, and appointed General Picsezki commander of Cracow.  All the Cracow regiments surrendered, and the Austrian  military authorities signed a document transferring the administration to the Poles.     National Government. In his telegram of the 7th November, Reuter&apos;s  Amsterdam agent  also rep  rted that a  Warsaw telegram, quoting the Warsaw newspapers, stated
that a directorate of the Polish Peoples Republic had been formed on the 6th Novemberwith its seat at Cracow.   This directorate was to include representatives of the PolishSocialist and People&apos;s parties of the kingdom of Poland and of Galicia, and was  to  be composed  -if five  members:  the  directorate^ task would be  the  establishment  as speedily as  possible of a national Government.   And in a telegram sent on the 9thNovember  the same agent further  reported  that a,telegram had been received fromCracow saying that, according to reports from Lublin, the National Government  ofthe  Polish  Republic  bad been formed there,  consisting of thirteen members of theSocial  D. mocratic and  Polish People&apos;s  parties, under the  presidency  of  DeputyM. Dazynski.     Annexation  of the Duchy of  Teschen. A  German  wireless  message of the5th November stated that according to the &quot; Gazetta Porana,&quot; a  proclamation of thePolish National  Council  had  announced the annexation of the duchy of Teschen  tothe  free independent Polish  state, and  had stated that for  the time being it was subject  to  the National  Council.   In their capacity  of chief  st-ite authorities thetwo  Governments would  settle between  them  the frontiers  between Poland andBohemia.     Annexation  of Galicia. Reuter  reports that a  Vienna  telegram  received  inAmsterdam  on the 8th November  said  that the  Austrian  premier had  been officiallynotified that the Polish Government had assumed sovereignty over Galicia.                                     SERBIA.    Election of a joint Jugo-Slav Government. Sir Horace Rumbold reported on the10th November [No. 2154] that a joint conference of the leaders  of the Jugo-Slavcommittee  in  London, the  leaders   of  the  Serbian  opposition,  and  M.  Pasitch,representative  of the Agram  national council, had  been held at Geneva and a jointJugo-Slav  Government  elected.   The new Government,  which  consisted of  threeSerbians and three  Austro Hungarian Jugo-Slavs, would,  he said, meet at  Paris atthe earliest possible moment.    In  regard to this Mr. Balfour telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at paris, Rome, and Washington on the 12th November, informing them that the SerbianMinister had communicated a note on the 9th November stating (1) that, as the SerbianGovernment had recognised the National Council of Zagreb as the legitimate repre-sentative of the Serbs, the Croats, and  Slovenes in Austria-Hungary, and as the SerbianGovernment considered the National Council as the Government of all the  Jugo-Slavsinhabiting Austria until the definitive  constitution of a single State  of all Serbs, Croats,and Slovenes, the Serbian Government begged His Majesty&apos;s  Government to recognise the said National Council and  to recognise it as an ally and the troops.formed  of Jugo-Slav volunteers as allied belligerents ;  and (2) that the  Serbian Government  and  theNational Council, of Zagreb desired to  form  a single  Government, whose  aim would  beto protect the rights and interests of the whole people of the Serbs,  the Croats, and theSlovenes, and that until the constitution  of this Government Dr.  Trumbic would  be representative of the National Council  of Zagreb accredited to the allied Governments.    Mr. Ballour instructed the three representatives to communicate the  terms of this note to the Governments to which they were accredited, and to say that, should they see no -objection, His Majesty&apos;s Government  proposed to agree.                                    TURKEY.    British High  Commissioner. On the  9th November Mr.  Balfour  telegraphedto Admiral Calthorpe informing him that he  had been appointed high commissioner ;he would be the  official  channel  of communication  with the Turkish Government inregard to the protection  of British  interests and the execution of the terms  of thearmistice.    Turkish Domination over Subject Races. -In a telegram sent on the 11th NovemberTNo. 4] to Admiral Calthorpe, Mr.  Balfour  said that  the British Government was determined that Turkish domination over subject races should be ended irrevocably.
                                     ARABIA.     Representation of King Hussein  at  Conferences [E.R. XCIII, p. 7 I. On the 8th November Mr. Balfour telegraphed [&quot;No. .340] to Sir Reginald Wingate transmitting a message from Colonel T. E. Lawrence for the King of Hejaz.   Colonel Lawrence said that General Allenby had reported that King Hussein wished to be represented at any discussions between the allies in regard to  the Arabs.  If this  were the case, Colonel Lawrence  suggested that, as  there would  be such conversations  in  a lew days&apos; time, King Hussein should at once send Emir Feisal, whose  splendid victories had given him a personal reputation in Europe, which  would make his success the easier.     From a telegram sent by Sir Reginald Wingate on the 13th November TNo.  1686] it appears  that King Hussein has appointed Emir Eeisal as his representative.     The Anglo-French Declaration. On  the  9th  November  Sir Reginald Wingate reported [No.  1649 I that King Hussein had requested  him to transmit  cordial thanks to the British Government for the declaration, which apparently had pleased him.  The King had expressed his intention  to go to Jeddah to discuss  its terms with Colonel Wilson so  soon as the latter should have arrived.     Treasures removed from Medina. Sir Reginald Wingate reported on  the 7 th November [No. 1634 that a jewel known as El Kawbab  el  Durri had been removed from the tomb of Mahomet at Medina, and that  King Hussein had begged that pressure should be put on the Turks to secure its restoration, and that of other  precious stones which  had also been removed.  King Hussein  thought that a good effect would  be produced on Arab and Moslem opinion if a  prompt restoration of these treasures was secured through the initiative of the British Government.    Submission of  Ibn Rashid [E.R. XCIIT, p. 7]. Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed on the 12th November [No. 1669] saying that Emir Abdulla had reported to the  King of Hejaz that a deputation, with 200 riding camels and 6 horses, had  arrived from Ibn Rashid, conveying letters of submission to  the King and recognition of Arab  Govern- ment ;  and that, after a short rest at  Abdulla&apos;s camp, the deputation  would proceed to Mecca.                                     SYRIA.    Damascus and  the Arab Area.- -General Clayton reported on the  8th November [No. 176]  that there  was an increasing,  distrust of French intentions, the population being  still strongly  in favour of an  independent  Arab  Government with british assistance.   If the French  acted  precipitately the existing distrust wpuld be increased and possibly active hostility provoked.    Emir  Abd el Kader Shot, Two of  the grandsons of Abd el Kader, the greatAlgerian,  had, General Clayton  said in his telegram of the 8th November, from the beginning assumed  an attitude of hostility to the presence ,of Arab troops,  and at last this hostility had reached such a pitch that Emir Feisal had urged  their deportation.In  consequence, the chief administrator sent  to arrest them on  the 7th November:Ahd el Kader resisted and fired at the police, who  shot him dead.  The  commander-in- chief would deal with the matter.    Beirut, In his telegram of  the  8th  November  [No.  176] General Clayton also reported that  .a considerable  section of the Christian  population was ready to  combine with the Moslems in requesting an Arab  national government, with the proviso that this should not entail sherifian rule ; aad that there were indications that the Christian and Mos!em sections of the population  were combining for  the purpose of forming  a united opinion in  regard  to the nature- of the government desired by Syrians.  Thegener-d desire  was for local autonomy  with a central Arab government linking all the states  together for defensive and  economic purposes.  The  Matonites did not go with the other Christian  communities : they were for  the most part pro-French.    Tripoli and Ladihiya. General Clayton also reported in his telegram of the 8th November that there was a marked Moslem majority in both these districts, which wasonposed to  French control and unanimously in favour of an  Arab national government.This Moslem  majority was estimated at from 75  to 90 per cent.  The  majority of the       [898-121]                     .                                 B  2
inhabitants of these districts were, be said, ( ? strongly) influenced by religion ; they were,too, unaccustomed to any control.     M. Picot. General  Clayton in his telegram of the 8th November reported thatM. Georges Picot had arrived, and had  bad an interview with the commander-in-chief.He was proceeding to Beirut, but his headquarters would be at G.H.Q.     Armenians in Damascus. On the  6th . November  General   Clayton  reported[No. 170] that  the Armenians in Damascus amounted to between  25,000 and 30,000, ofwhom  from 5,000 to 7,000 were in need  of relief.  The central Armenian c rnmittee inEgypt had  already subscribe&apos;! 1,000Z. ; but  this was  entirely exhausted, and he was approaching it  for rarire.   He  trusted that the Armenian  committees in England andFrance would be urged to place funds at his disposal for relief purposes in Damascus andAleppo as the matter was urgent.                                  PALESTINE.    Message from the  Jews. On  the 9th  November General Clayton  transmitted[No. 177], for the  information  of the Prime  Minister and  Mr. Balfour, the followingresolution,  passed  at meetings held in  the principal Jewish centres in  Palestine,copies of which General Clayton had been informed bv the Zionist commission, were sent  to the French, Italian,  Greek, and  American Governments :      We, the Jewish population of Palestine, on the occasion of the first anniversary of Mr.  Balfours  declaration on behalf of  the British Government,  which solemnlyrecognised  the  Jewish nation, and  promised  to  assisi  in restoring  Palestine  as its national home,  express  our deep gratitude to  the  free and generous nations  of theBritish Empire, and to all  the  allies who  have adhered to  Britain&apos;s  immortal  act ofjustice.  We send a greeting of admiration to the gallant armies  which, led to victoryby General Allenby, have liberated  this Holy Land.  It is with particular  pride andemotion that we extend our fraternal salutes to the Jewish  regiment  which worthilytook its share in this war for the world&apos;s and, for Jevvry&apos;s freedom.     We proclaim our firm belief that the  promise given by free nations will be realised in its  deepest  and amplest meaning,  and  that the Jewish people will soon  againco-operate  with them as an equal among  equals for the  attainment  of these eternalideals whose birthplace is the soil of Palestine.     The Haifa Moslems. General Clayton reported on the 12th November [No. 182]that the Moslems of Haifa were friendly to us, but felt some uneasiness  in  regard toZionism.  Two  movements  were on foot:  one for the organisation  of Moslems andadherence to the King of Hejaz, the other for the organisation of both Christian and moslem Arabs  commercially and intellectually in  a pro-British sense.   The  formermovement, which was being watched, had. not been received favourably.     The Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem. In his telegram of the  12th NovemberGeneral Clayton also reported  that the grand mufti was present at the  opening  of theRothschild hospital in Jerusalem on the  3rd-  November, and  had made a  speech, inwhich he welcomed that and all similar undertakings in Palestine.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    Great  Meeting at  Baghdad on the  .17th September. The &quot;Palestine  News,&quot;  theofficial organ of the Egyptian expeditionary force, at whose headquarters it is published,in its issue  of  the  17th  October, gives  the following account of a great meeting ofnotables at Baghdad on  the  17th September :     Renter&apos;s agency is informed that a meeting of shaykhs held by the commander-in-chief was one of the most remarkable functions which have been witnessed in Baghdadfor many years.  In 1911 Nazim Pasha attempted a  similar gathering  of the chiefs ofthe Iraq, but the assemblage was a failure, and such shaykhs as came to Baghdad returnedto their districts with highly unfavourable reports of the Turkish  Government.     The leading chieftains  from Samawah to Kibin were present on the 17 th September.To those conversant with the history of Iraq during the past twenty years, the corn-position of the  meeting was rich in significance.   Leaders of tribes  who were littleaccustomed  to meet together in amity, such as  the Beni Hassan and the Fatlah,  shared
on this occasion the hospitality of the British Government:  men, like the Khazail chief,who for three generations  have suffered  from the jealous  hostility of the  weak  butrevengeful Turkish Government, accepted the invitation  to Baghdad without fear orhesitation when it came from the British commander-in-chief.     A notable feature of the gathering was the presence of representatives of the greatland-owning  &quot; saiyafs &quot; of the middle Euphrates.     Amongst those present were Kurdish beys and pashas from Kifri and Khanikinwho have, till recently, been separated by almost  impassable  and  invariably insecureprovinces from  the shaykhs of Samawah, or from those of Dagharah or Shamiyeh.   ,.  To have brought those men together in pursuance of a common aim is the first step towards that solidarity and co-operation Avith each other and with the administration,which is  necessary for the prosperity of the Iraq.                                     PERSIA.     Question of Representation at the Peace Congress. Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to sir. Cox on the 7th November [No. 578] saying that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government couldnot by itself decide the question of the representation of neutrals at a peace congress ;that was a matter for the whole body of the  allies.  But so far as that government itself was concerned a duly authorised Persian representative would be welcomed at theplace of meeting,  that he might be consulted if and when questions directly affectingPersian rights should come up.o
