Information has been received, from a source of undoubted authority,in regard  to  the  Terror which has resulted from the murder of M. Ouritzky and the attempt on  M. Lenin.  On  the plea  that they  were  faced with conspirators, theBolsheviks were arresting  men, women, and children  of  the  bourgeoisie who  had noconnexion,with the social revolutionaries  responsible  for  the  outrages.  According to official  reports, in three days at the  beginning of the month more than 500  persons were shot without  enquiry or sentence, and  there had been wholesale  arrests  anddecapitations.   The press was full of bloodthirsty articles, and preparations were beingmade for  further  decapitations.  This state of things had  induced  all the  foreign representatives, including those of Germany and  Austria, to  address M. Zinovieff, onthe 3rd September, protesting, in the name  of humanity, against the wanton murder of innocent and peaceful citizens. ,     Constitution of the Soviet Republic. -The Russian Government has  published by wireless the  following  interpretation  of the  constitution of the Russian socialisticfederative  Soviet Republic, drawn by the fifth  All-Russian assembly of the  Soviets, atthe meeting held on the tOth July, 1918 :      The declaration of the  rights of the working and exploited people, confirmed by thethird All-Russian  assembly of the  Soviets  in  January 1918, together  with the con-stitution of the Republic,  confirmed by  the fourth  All-Russian  assembly,  form  thefundamental laws of the Russian socialist Republic, and they  will enter  into force assoon  as they are published in the &quot; Izvestia,&quot;  the  official organ of the All-Russiancentral  executive committee of the Soviets.   This constitution  must be published in allthe  local  newspapers of  the  Soviet Republic, and  must  be  placarded  in  all thesoviet institutions.   The fifth  All-Russian assembly instructs the people&apos;s Commissaryfor Education to introduce in all the  schools without exception  the explanation and
interpretation of  these  fundamental laws of the Russian Republic  according to thefolio wing scheme : &quot;5     1. Russia  is declared to be  a republic  of the  Soviets of workers&apos;, soldiers&apos;, andpeasants&apos; delegates.   The whole  power  at  the centre  of  Government  and  in  everylocality belongs to the Soviets.     The Russian Soviet Republic is  based on the  principle of a free union  of freenations, as a federation of soviet national republics.     2. Our fundamental task being the abolition of all exploitation of men by men, weaim at the  complete  abolition of  the division  of  society into classes, at the  mercilesscrushing of the exploiters, at the establishment of a socialist organisation of society, andat triumphant socialism in all countries.     The  All-Russian assembly  of  the Soviets  of workers&apos;,  soldiers&apos;, and  peasants&apos;delegates further decrees as follows :      In order  to  realise the  socialisation  of the  land,  private property  in  land  isabo ished,  and the  whole land  becomes national  property,  and  is  handed over forcultivation to the peasants on the principle of so much land  as  he can cultivate  beingallotted to each man.     All woods, mines, and water  supplies, as well as the whole of the  live  stock and.... are declared national  property.     As a first step towards  the  complete passing over  of all  factories, works, mines,railways,  and other means of production and transport as property of  the Republic, thesoviet has issued a law relating to the control of production by  the workmen, and a law  enabling the soviet of national economy to safeguard the  power of  the workingmasses over the exploiters.     The Ail-Russian assembly of Soviets is preparing a law providing for the  cancellingof all loans concluded by the Government of the  Tsar and by landlords  and  the  bour-geoisie ....  feeling confident  that the  Soviet Power  will  resolutely  continue itsefforts until the victory of the international working class over capital is  accomplished.     All banks  become the property of the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; State, as this is oneof the conditions of freeing the working masses from the yoke of capital.     In order  to  destroy the parasitic  classes  of  society  obligatory work for  all  is introduced.     In order to safeguard the power of the working  masses and  to remove  the  possi-bility of the power of the exploiters being restored, we declare  that all  workers are tobe armed, and  the Red army of workers and peasants is to  be formed and the propertiedclasses are to be completely disarmed.     The Bolsheviks Apologia.- -The Soviet Government has sent  out the  followingwireless message as an explanation or defence of its recent actions : At the time when,through  the intermediary of representatives of neutral Powers, the  Government ofthe  Soviet  Republic  was  negotiating  with  the English  and  French  Governmentsregarding the  exchange  of the  diplomatic and military  representatives  and  theirrespective subjects, the fact was revealed  that the  diplomatic and  military  repre-sentatives of England and  France took advantage  of their diplomatic  positions toorganise conspiracies in the territory of the Soviet Republic with the object of capturingthe Council of the People&apos;s Commissaries, spreading corruption and promoting agitation in the detachments of the  army, and preparing  explosions of bridges, railway trains,and  food depdts.   The documents in the possession of the Government which have beenin part published by  the  extraordinary  commission  and by  the commissaries of theNorthern Region, prove without leaving  the least doubt that the threads of the plotwere in the hands of the chief of  the British mission, Lockhart,  and of his agents.  Ithas  also  been  proved that the building of the British embassy in  Petrograd  wastransformed into  a meeting place in which the conspirators took refuge.   Under theseconditions, while  inspired by a sincere desire fully to respect diplomatic immunity andthe rules governing international relations, the  Government of the  Soviet Republic is nevertheless not in a position to accord  liberty of action to persons who have come toliussia as diplomatic and military representatives, but have in fact placed themselves inthe position of conspirators against the  Government  of our country.   Henceforth theGovernment of the Soviet Republic is faced  with  the necessity to create such a regimefor persons convicted of participation in plots as will make it   impossible for them tocontinue their activities.
   GOVERNMENT OF  THE NORTHERN REGION.       Arrest of the Government and its Consequences. Mr. Lindley  telegraphed  on the*  6th September [No. 126] that on the previous night he had  been warned by the  French   Ambassador that Captain Chaplin, commander of the Russian truops, intended to arrest   the members of the Government; he had immediately informed General Poole, who sent   a note to Captain Chaplin warning him not  to  do so.  That morning Mr. Lindley had   learnt that a coup d&apos;etut had been carried out in the night, and that the Government had   been  deported to an island in the  White  Sea.   Captain Chaplin had prepared  posters   explaining his action  and proclaiming a  state  of siege, and nominating a governor-   general as civil dictator.  The allied representatives  had agreed that  this action, the   responsibility for which must inevitably be attributed to the allies, could not be tolerated.   They had, therefore, stopped the issue  of posters, aud had arranged  with General Poole   that the boat carrying the members of  the Government should return at once ; they had   further agreed that the newly selected constituted authorities should not be allowed to   assume power.        Friction between the military authorities and the  Russian  Government had been   gradually increasing  for some time, and the allied representatives had  been engaged, so   recently as the previous day, in negotiating with the latter for some arrangement which   would define their  respective functions in  a manner satisfactory to both.   The events   now reported would increase difficulties enormously,  especially as Captain Chaplin was   the man who had organised the  rising  in Archangel and put the Government in power.        He added that the town was quiet, but warnings had been received from  reliable   quarters that the news  of the coup d&apos;etat would have disastrous effects in the villages   which  were almost  entirely social revolutionary, and  would  regard it  as  a purely   reactionary  movement.        On the following day he telegraphed again  [No.  133] saying that a strike had   broken out on the night of the 6th  in  most industries as a result of the coup d&apos;etat, and   still continued.   Captain Chaplin and  two  members of the late Government who had   not been arrested had succeeded in publishing proclamations of  a nature calculated to   provoke civil war.  The latter&apos;s  proclamation was the more serious, definitely accusing,   as it did, the conspirators  of the intention to place  the  Grand Duke  Michael  on the   throne and asserting that he was in the town.   In  order to calm public opinion the   following proclamation was published over  the names of the British, American, French,   .and Italian  representatives :             The representatives of those allied [group omitted] whose troops have  arrived        in Northern Russia having  heard  this  morning of the  kidnapping of  the Govern-        ment of the Northern  Region feel it their duty to deny all responsibility  for this        act.  They  disapprove  of  all  measures  of  violence  by   whoever they may be        committed, more especially since they arrived  here with  the hope of seeing the        establishment of a free regime of order and legality.            The act was carried out by Russians against Russians,  and  is  not, therefore,        strictly speaking, any concern of the allies.   But the representatives  of the latter        feel constrained, in the special circumstances which exist, to see that  the arrested        persons are at once given their liberty and brought back to Archangel.  As soon        as this  is done it is hoped that an arrangement will be  come to which will prevent        the recurrence of such incidents in future, and which will unite all Russians in the        work of the  regeneration of their  country.            In the meantime, the affairs  of the district will go on  as before, and the allied        representatives invite all good Russians to  pursue their normal occupations in full        confidence that no attack on their liberties will be  countenanced by the allies.        Mr. Lindley went  on to say that  the  members  of the Government were on their   way  back,  but the position had become  more serious.   As far as  could be  judged,   dissatisfaction at the coup d&apos;etat was  very general, and bands  of armed peasants were   said to be approaching  the town for the purpose of re-establishing the Government.        Mr. Lindley at first thought that Captain Chaplin and his  accomplices ought to be   arrested, but General Poole said that this would have a disastrous effect on the Russian   army now in course of  formation, and  as the French Ambassador was also opposed to   the measure it has not been carried out;  but they  have promised to  take no  further   -action.        The  allied  representatives  were  in  as awkward a  position as  could  well be   imagined.   The  Government contained elements who had not been  working  whole-   hearteclly with them, and whom they had hoped to eliminate.   Their position had been
 immensely  strengthened  by  what  had  occurred, and it was doubtful  whether  any members of the Government would now consent to serve unless all were reinstated.   The  0 French Ambassador, in Mr. Lindley&apos;s opinion, took too lenient a view of the coup d&apos;etat and too severe a one of the misdemeanours of the Government  whose popular backing he seemed to underestimate.     The zemstvos were due  to  meet on the  10th September, and the allied repre- sentatives were trying to get into touch  with their  leaders and to use them for  the formation of a new coalition  Government.   Mr. Lindiey could  not  say whether this would succeed, and it might  be necessary for  the allied  representatives to issue  a proclamation to the effect that they were the supreme authority in  the country until  a Government which reflected the views of the people could be  formed.  If this  should be done, General Poole had consented to execute their  instructions.     Telegraphing again on the 8th September [No.  144] Mr. Lindiey said that Captain Chaplin  had resigned his  post as  Russian commander-in-chief: there was a difference of opinion as to the advisability of any further action being taken against him.     The strike had extended  to tramways and railways ; Mr. Lindiey felt no doubt that the Government had the vast majority of the people on its side.     The allied representatives  had decided  to issue  a proclamation, but, as it  could not be printed on  account  of the  strike, had been  unable to do so.   They had  proposed to say that they had- constituted themselves the supreme authority, but only till the return of those members of the Government who had been arrested and the re-formation of a Government  commanding  the respect of the people;  solely too in  order  to prevent civil War.     Mr. Lindiey added that the  communication  which would be made to the members of the Government on  their return was to be discussed  by him and his colleagues.     On the 9th September Mr. Lindiey telegraphed again [No.  142] saying that  at the meeting held for  this purpose it had been  decided to inform M. Tchaicovski that- after having shown their disapprobation of the coup d&apos;etat in the strongest possible way by fetching him and  his colleagues back, the allied representatives had decided that, in  order  to avoid an outbreak, it  had been  necessary  for them to assume  the supreme authority until he had  returned and  a new Government had been formed ; that Captain Chaplin and M. Startsev had not been  allowed  to assume power, and had been sent out  of the town ; that they could not conceal from him that the action of&apos; some of his colleagues, in thwarting and opposing the  military authorities, had created great irritation in the army and much more sympathy for the perpetrators of  the coup d&apos;etai than  they deserved ; and  that in these circumstances they thought it essential that certain members of the Government should make  way  for people of a  somewhat different character.     The ministers arrived  at 9 P.M. in one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, and in accordance with the desire of his colleagues, Mr. Lindiey went on board and spoke to M. Tchaicovski in the above sense.  The latter said that  he must have  time to consider the matter.  He would come to  see the  United States Ambassador that morning and discuss the whole question with  us ;  in the meantime he would refrain from all proclamations and appeals to the public.   He  was not at  all vindictive, but naturally considered the punishment inflicted on Captain Chaplin inadequate: he and his accomplices, lie thought, ought to be sent to the western  front.     In further conversation M. Tchaicovski said that  he  had been  treated with every consideration by his captors.     Liability  for Military Service. Mr. Lindiey  telegraphed  on the  28th August [No. 106] saying that the restoration of  the universal liability to military service in the territory under its control had been declared by the Government of the Northern Region by a decree  dated the 20th August.  The Government expected to get some 5,000 men ; it  proposed to call up the officers without delay,  then the dwellers in towns,  and, lastly, when the harvest was over, the countryfolk.                                    TRIPOLI.     The Shaykh of the Senussi.- The  Admiralty announces  that the  arrival of the Shaykh of the  Senussi at  Constantinople has been reported.  He was received, with elaborate ceremony by Enver Pasha and  representatives of the Sultan and the Shaykh- ul-Islam.  The Shaykh of&apos; the Senussi was accompanied by Yasuf Shetran, the  deputyfor Benghazi in the Ottoman Parliament.  It will be remembered that he crossed from.Tripoli to Pola  in a German submarine.
                                  PALESTINE.     The  Greek Feast  of the  Assumption. General  Clayton  telegraphed on  the8th  September [No. 55]  that on the feast of the Assumption it was the custom  for large numbers of the Greek Orthodox  to camp in the fields round  the  Garden ofGethsemane.  This gathering took place on the 28th August for the first  time  since1914, and, to  the  great satisfaction of the Greeks, was attended by a military band.There  was no disorder though formerly this feast was usually the occasion  of rioting,the Armenians opposing the Greeks.     New Schools in Jaffa. In the same telegram General Clayton  reported the very favourable reception which had been given to the new schools opened in Jaffa.                                    ARABIA.     King  Hussein and  Ibn Saud. Sir Reginald Wingate  telegraphed on the  8thSeptember [No. 1331] saying, in regard to the Khurma dispute, that the Arab Bureauhand-book of Hedjaz had been very hastily compiled and, in the absence of better informa-tion,had restricted the Hedjaz eastern boundary to the limits of the former effective Turkishcontrol.  Since his succession to the emirate in 1908, the Sherif had certainty exercisedauthority to the east, and  he, Sir Reginald Wingate, had  already referred to the  1910treaty (concluded after a sherifial expedition to Quasim) under which the Harb, Ateibah,Subai, and Muteir tribesmen were relieved  from  taxation  by either Ibn Saud or IbnRashid.   It could not therefore be said that  Khurma  had  no connection with  theSherifs juidsdiction prior to Arab revolt.  His  appointment of Khalid as emir  was evidence to the contrary, and whatever we might think of his discretion in choosing thepresent moment  to assert this authority a glance at the  map showing the situation ofKhur &apos;ttia in regard to Taif would explain  why he could not be expected to disregard theincrease of Wahabite activity there.     Sir  Reginald Wingate hoped  this telegram had made it clear that he did notadvocate any unfair pressure or subordination of the interests of Ibn Saud to those of king Hussein.  But  at the  same  time  he submitted that His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentWere under far greater obligations to the latter who, at a critical time, had opposed theTurkish Jehad and had joined  the  allies, his northern army being  now in  active co-operation With the Egyptian expeditionary force.                                   ARMENIA.     Denial of the Reported Massacres of Turks. Information has come to hand fro n awell-informed  source, to  the effect that  the reports  ef  Tartars  being massacred byArmenians are completely untrue, the work of enemy agents.  Even  to-day, when themassacres of Armenians are being renewed with great severity in Turkey, the Armeniansprotect Turks and Tartars and work for conciliation.                                    PERSIA.     Financial Assisiance.-^-Sir Charles Marling telegraphed on  the  8th  September[No. 796] proposing that an agreement should be made  with the Persian Governmentin virtue of which it would receive 350,000 tomans a month, a sum which Vossugh-ed-Dowleh hoped for, though he said that it would be barely  sufficient to  carry on with.Sir Charles Marling suggested the following as essential clauses:      His Majesty&apos;s Government  agree to  make  advances to the Persian Government,through the Imperial Bank of Persia in  London,  to  the -Amount of 350,000  tomans amonth.  The reimbursement by  the  Persian Government of these  advances will bediscussed between the two Governments on lines of the agreement of October 1915.     This arrangement wdll remain in force so  long as it is jointly considered to  be tothe interest of the two Powers.     It is understood that  these advances are  being made in virtue of  the agreement ofOctober 1915.     Turkish Propaganda-0a  the 6th  September Sir  Charles Marling telegraphed[No. 785] that he  had been informed by Vossugh-ed-Dowleh that Turkish agents  were very active in the  Asterabad  district and among certain of the Turcomans, by whomtheir advances Were received coldly.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.     The  British Embassy. On the 6th September Mr, Lindley telegraphed [No. 125,received the 11th September] saying that as regarded  the destruction of the embassyhe had officially requested  the  Netherlands Minister on the 15th  July to take the embassy building and its contents under his protection in the same way as the DanishMinister   had  done  in  the case of  French  embassy.    At the  same  time he had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Consul to  arrange  with the  Netherlands  Minister that theDutch fl ag should fly on the building.     Captain Cromie. In  another  telegram  [No.  123] sent on the 6th  September[received  the 11th September] Mr. Lindley said that he  had just received the news ofthe murder  of Captain  Cromie  by  the Bolsheviks  and of the accusations which thelatter had made  against him.     The fact was,  he said,  that that gallant officer  had  devoted his whole time  at petrograd to the service of his  country.   His first  object had been to prevent theBaltic fleet from  falling into  German  hands;  he  had then helped in  evacuating(f valuable)  stores; and latterly  had given most of his attention to plans for preventinga German advance on  Vologda. These activities, carried out for  months  in  dailydanger of his life,  had brought him (? more or less) into (? co-operation) with Russianshostile to  the Bolshevik  regime and  therefore  claimed as  reactionaries.  His plans might     Turkish  Advance. Sir Charles  Marling  telegraphed on the  7th  September[No. 795] that it would appear, from the latest  reports which had come to hand;inregard to the progress of a  relatively  large Turkish  force, that this force would  reachZinjan within the course of the next few days.   He suggested that having regard to the positions  of our  own forces, the Persian Cossack division might be utilised;  he  knew that Vossugh-ed-Dowleh was not averse, and would ascertain his conditions.  Mr. Balfourreplying on the 10th September  [No. 482] said  that  the employment of the Cossackdivision was strongly favoured by the military authorities: he said too that, so far as itwas materially possible,  financial help would be forthcoming.     Telegraphing again on  the  9th  September [No. 800] Sir  C. Marling said  thatVossugh-ed-Dowleh was willing  to work to the end of Persia joining us, a policy whichhe strongly favoured.   In his (Vossugh&apos;s) opinion the  Shah would be the chief obstacle,but Colonel Staroselski thought that, though His Majesty would  try to make money for himself out of it, he would not prove  to  be  intractable.   There was, Sir CharlesMarling said, unquestionably a body of public opinion  forming that Persia must come inon the winning side, i.e., ours, if she was to gain  anything from the war.   Vossugh-ed-Dowiek.would inform Sir Charles Marling in a few days as to what inducement should,in his opinion, be held out to influence  public opinion.     Release of Captain  Noel. Sir Charles Marling telegraphed on the 3rd  September[No. 776] that Captain Noel  had been  released by Jangalis, and was  coming  toTeheran.     Tico  French Priests  murdered-Sir Charles Marling  telegraphed  on  the 7thSeptember [No. 791] that Monsignor Sontag, head of  the French Catholic mission, andanother priest had been  massacred at Urumia at  end of July.     Armenian Refugees. On the same day, the 7th  September, Sir Charles Marlingalso telegraphed [No. 787] that the total number of the Armenian refugees was estimated&apos;at 40,000 or thereabouts..     Mixed Financial Commission. Sir Charles  Marling  telegraphed  on  the  8thSeptember [No.  797]  suggesting that  this was  an opportune  moment for settling thequestion of the mixed  financial  commission  and of  the disposal of the money  in itspossession or owing to&apos; it.  The commission,  though it met regularly, had no businessbeyond the payment of  the salaries of its personnel; and though it rendered no practicalservice  it  had made a strong  party  cry  against us.   In  his  telegram  of the  10thSeptember [No. 482] Mr. Balfour said that the matter was under consideration.
very  well have  included  the destruction  of certain hridges as the Bolsheviks hadrdejiared.   In Captain Cromie His Majesty had lost a most gallant, capable, and devotednlrvant.     M. Tchaikowshy  and  his  Colleagues. Mr.  Lindiey  telegraphed  on  the  ] OthSeptember [No. 151] saying that,  as  he had anticipated,  M.  Tchaikowsky and hiscolleagues were far less amenable after spending a night among  their friends on shorethan they had been on board.   Contrary to his express agreement with Mr. Liudley hehad published a proclamation  which, though  harmless io  itself,  took  for granted thatall the members of his Government would continue  in their offices.     As a result of two very long  conversations it had been agreed that all the members-of the Government  should be  reinstated ;  that the  projected  proclamation be issued ;and that  there  should be some  new men added to the  present  Ministry, and  some changes in office among the old ones.     As  regards the  general  strike, M.  Tchaikowsky  had  asked  that the  strikecommittee should be allowed to publish  the  proclamation, which he  had seen, callingback  the  workmen.   The  allied  representatives had learnt  that morning that the proclamation contained passages of  a most objectionable character, stating among other things that the return of the Government was due  entirely to the strike, and that theworkmen  must be ready to take similar action in future at a momenfs notice.     The issue of the notice had therefore been unbidden  by the allied representatives,who were calling on M. Tchaikowsky  to publish one of  his own, putting matters intheir true light,  and  explaining that the allies had ordered the members of the Govern-ment to  be  brought  back  before the  public  even knew  of their  arrest.   ThatM. Tchaikowsky should have approved this proclamation will give you an idea of thedifficulties in the  way of  working with  him.   This morning he actually had thetemerity  to  maintain that the strike  would only  cease  if the proclamation  of thecommittee were  issued, and Mr.  Lindiey had told him that it was  fully realised that the  strike  would  cease  when he  (M.  Tchaikowsky) and  his  colleagues  ceased to encourage it.     Some arrangement  had  still  to be arrived at, defining the  exact demarcationbetween the jurisdiction of the Russian  authorities  and the military command.   Thecoup d&apos;etat had made this a matter  of extreme difficulty.  It was deplorable that thefailure to  prevent the coup d&apos;etat had compromised our influence.     The Terror. Further information  has  been  received from  the same authoritativesource.   The informant stated that Mr. Lockhart had been arrested and  condemned to death, but the foreign representatives had saved him at the last moment.   In Petrogradtwenty-eight  British subjects, including the  consul-general,  and  eleven French hadbeen arrested.   The British were  confined in  the  fortress of SS.  Peter and Paul, wherethey had  absolutely  no food, but an organisation had been formed to remedy this : thegeneral conditions in the prisons defied description.   The Terror  continued :  executionswithout trial took place nightly.   All  the  foreign  representatives,  German included,had protested both by word of mouth and in  writing.  The Government had published a list of more than 1,000 hostages  who would be  shot should an attempt be made uponthe life of a commissary :  among the hostages were  four Servian  officers.     The intentions of the Bolsheviks were openly declared in a wireless message senton the 8th September by the chairman  of the Petrograd  soviet  to the chairman of theTashkent soviet, which ran as follows :  We shall  destroy  with shot, fire,  and  the swordall those  whom the hangmen  of our freedom send to ruin our cities.  The whole ofour  people stand for the Soviet Power.  It is  only with the help of Anglo-Frenchbayonets  that our Russian  landlords and  bankers  hope  to conquer  us.  Our reply isdeath to all the enemies of the workers&apos; revolution.                                    TURKEY.     The Funds of the C.U.P.-lh a telegram sent on the 10th  September [No;  1559]Sir  Horace  Rumbold reported that Dr.  Parodi  had informed  him of meetings  ofinfluential Turks, held at  Geneva on the 7th September and the  following day, at whichmeasures were agreed upon with the Swiss banks with a view to the safe custody of the funds of the Committee of Union and Progress.     Situation in Constantinople. Sir Horace Rumbold also said that Dr. Parodi hadbeen informed  that any  day a revolution  might break out in  Constantinople, as thesituation in that city was very strained.
    Plot against Enver Pasha. Sir Horace Rumbold further reported that Dr. Parodihad received iritelligenc 3 of a plot for the suppression, of Ehver Pasha, which ha*d- $feenhatched in Broussa and countered by the  police.                               &quot;-                                    ARABIA.     Sherif  Feisdl.-^-Sir  Reginald Wingate  telegraphed  on  the  10th - September[No. 1335] that King Hussein had  published a notice in the &quot; Quibla&quot; intimating thathe  had not sanctioned the grant  to Jaaffer Pasha of the title of commander-in-chief,military ranks and titles not being  recognised by the Hejaz Government.  The effect ofthis on the Arab northern army was, Sir Reginald Wingate said, very bad ; some of themen showed a  mtitinous spirit, and, for  several days, all military preparations  weresuspended.  Sherif Feisal tendered his resignation by  telegraph.  Matters, however,had been satisfactorily arranged and operations resumed.     Sir Reginald Wingate said that he was satisfied  that  the prime factor in thedisagreement  between  Feisal and  his  father was a misunderstanding of the situationand of their respective views,  which intriguers at  Mecca and in  the Akaba area hadstrengthened.   The fact that most  urgent representations had to be made in his name and in that of General Allenby before King Hussein would send the requisite assurancesto his son was indicative of his anxious and suspicious frame of mind.                                     PERSIA.     Turkish Aims-.
