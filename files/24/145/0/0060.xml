On the 7th May Lord  Curzon  telegraphed [No. 827] toLord Derby in Paris asking  him to  forward the  Foreign  Office reply to  the Russianwireless message [E.R. CXIX, p.  3] which, he said, had only  been received- on  the5th May, owing to the Carnarvon  wireless  station not having been available for somedays on account of the storm.     In the course of his  reply he  said: (.1) That  MM.  Niniuk  and Raskolnikoff  hadbeen released from prison on the 5th  May, and henceforth  would only  be  subject todomiciliary arrest.  (2) That as regarded exchange it must be pointed out that the above mentioned were primarily naval prisoners,  and the Admiralty  would not agree to  anyexchange which  would not  secure the release of all naval  prisoners detained  by thesoviet government, including Mr. Bailey and the Belgian Captain Schoonjans.   (3) that nothing  was known here of the M.  Struiski mentioned by the soviet government,  andthat we held no prisoners taken near Reval other than MM. Raskolnikoff  and Niniuk.(4) That the proposals of the soviet government in regard  to the prisoners who would remain in Russia after this exchange had been  effected were preposterous and seemeddesigned to protract negotiations indefinitely.NORTHERN TERRITORY.     The  Archangel  Town   Council  and  Admiral Kolchak. On  the  11th  MayMr.  Lindley reported [No.  304]  that  the Archangel  town council  had,  two days
 previously, unanimously decided  to send a  telegram  to Admiral Kolchak  warmly congratulating him  on the formation and recognition of the  all-Russian government, and wishing him speedy victory over &quot;the traitorous Bolshevik,  the  destroyers of the Russian nation.&quot;     The majority of the  town council, Mr.  Lindiey said, were  representatives of the various socialist parties. UKRAINA.     The Consular Body at Kieff. On the 5th May, according to a wireless message from Kieff, the  Italian, Belgian,  Portuguese, Danish,   Dutch,   Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, and Finnish consuls had informed the commanders of the &quot; Waldeck-Bousseau &quot; and &quot; Ernest-Benan &quot;  that by. order  of the  Ukrainan  government  consuls  were compelled to leave Ukraina via Odessa not later than the 10th May.     It will be remembered that M. Bakovsky had  requested  the. consuls  in  Kieff to inquire  of their governments  whether  they  would consent  to  the establishment of official relations with Ukraina [E.B. CXV, p.  3] ; a request which was of so peremptory a character that  the expulsion of the  consular  body seemed probable in the event of an unfavourable reply.     Relations loith  Poland. On the 5th May  Lord Acton  reported  [Nos. 765 and 766] that Dr.  Lozynsky,  uncler-secretary  of state for foreign  affairs  in  the West Ukrainan government,  had requested him to inform the  peace  conference  that he was proceeding  to  Paris   on  the  following  day  accompanied  by  Colonel  Dmytro Witowsky and a secretary.  The object of the mission was to settle the question of the Polish-Ruthenian frontier.     Dr.   Lozynsky   further  wished  to  inform   his  majesty&apos;s  government  of  a telegram which   he  had  received from  his  own   government  since  his   arrival in Svdtzerland.  According to this  the Poles were diverting at any rate a  large  part of General HalleFs army to Lemberg, where  General Haller himself was said  to have delivered a very inflammatory speech to the effect that the  Polish army  had flown to build a nest at Lemberg, whence  it would  wing  its flight still further to the  east, in order to  fix the frontiers which must be granted to the Polish  state.  M. Lozynsky showed this telegram, which was in German,  to Mr. Savery, who  said that  the passage in  General HalleFs alleged  speech relative to  the  Polish  frontiers  was  rather obscurely worded;  it was, of course,  also  possible that its  sense might  have been distorted in the translation from Polish into German.     M. Lozynsky said  that the  Ukrainan authorities had  recently  again offered to conclude an armistice with  the Poles  until such  time as the peace conference should have given its decision in the matter of the Polish-Ukrainan  frontier.  This offer had been refused, and M. Lozynsky was now on  his  way  to  Paris, together with  Colonel Witowsky, in the hope that the matter might be settled more easily there than on  the scene of  the dispute.     Colonel Witowsky  explained that the  Ukrainan government had withdrawn alarge part of its troops from  Galicia, in order to  combat the Bolsheviks, because it had  counted on the Poles listening  to  the  admonition  of the  allies,  and suspending hostilities.   If, however, the Poles continued to mass troops in  the neighbourhood of Lemberg, and to  attack  the Ukrainan  forces,   the  Ukrainan government  would have to  withdraw its troops  from  the  eastern front   against  the  Bolsheviks,  andthe  latter would very  likely  more  than  recover the ground which  they  had recently  lost. BESSARABIA.     Manifesto of the new Provisional Soviet Government. According  to  a wireless message  sent from Odessa on the  6th May the following  manifesto has  been issued by the newdy formed provisional workmen*s and peasants&apos; government of Bessarabia, of which M. Krivorukoff is president :      In the name of  the revolutionary peasants and workmen, and in the name of the revolutionary Bessarabian  Red   army, it is declared   that  henceforward the  only legitimate authority  in Bessarabia is the workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; provisional government. Workmen and peasants of  Bessarabia!  Soldiers  of  the Red army.!  The long awaited hour of your  country&apos;s  liberation  has come.   When a year ago the chains  of an  age- long oppression  first began to fall from Bessarabia, the  troops of the Rumanian king and the  imperialists&apos; clique (?) forced on  us a yoke more terrible than that of  the
tsarist regime the  yoke  of  Rumanian autocracy.   The  Rumanian  and  Moldavianbourgeoisies mercilessly revenged themselves on the toiling masses of Bessarabia.   the blood of the fighters for the  cause of the proletariat  flowed like a river.   Now therobbed  and  tortured Bessarabian  peasants and  workmen are  rising against theiroppressors.SIBERIA.     Suggested recognition of  the  Omsk  Government  by  His  Majesty s Government[E.R. CXIX,  p.  3].-On. the 11th  May Lord Curzon telegraphed  [No.  672] toMr.  Balfour informing him, in regard to Mr. Lindley&apos;s  suggestion, that it  seemed tohim  to be safer to confine the recognition of Admiral Kolchak for the present to those areas in Siberia which he had more or less effectively under his control, and to recognisehis government as the provisional government of Siberia.  The title could be expandedlater on.     Agrarian  policy of  the Government. On  the  4th  May  Colonel  Robertsontransmitted [No.  420] a telegram from Mr. Hodgson in  regard to the agrarian policyof the Omsk government.  Mr.  Hodgson said that Admiral  Kolchak regarded thegovernments declaration as a measure of the  first importance.  The  object  was to insure the sowing of crops by  giving to the present possessors  a guarantee that theywould be allowed  to reap the harvest on the land which  had been cultivated by them,however defective their title to that land might prove to be.  The  national assembly would be left to make the final settlement of the land question.     General Semenoff and Admiral Kolchak. On the 9th May Colonel  Robertsonreported [No.  439] that he had been informed by General Horvat that a fear of beingdismissed later on  was  the  real explanation  of General  Semenoff&apos;s unwillingness toserve under Admiral  Kolchak, whilst he was ready to command a corps under GeneralIvanoff Rinoff.  The last mentioned would agree to this if he  in turn  were given thepowers of an army commander : but this would make him practically independent, and admiral Kolchak would not consent.     General Ivanoff Rinoff. On the 9th May Colonel Robertson reported  [No. 439] a conversation with General Ivanoff Rinoff.   The latter told him that  he  was  of  opinionthat regions such as  Ukraina, Turkestan,  and the Far East should, for geographicalreasons, be economically  autonomous; but  he was opposed  to the idea  of splitting upRussia into small states on a racial  basis.     The general  further said that he  found when he  came to the Far East in theautumn of 1918 two existing dangers : one of which, the possibility of Japan joiningGermany, had, he thought, been determined  by the defeat  of the latter Power.   Theother was the attitude  of -the. independent  atamans, but  it had  been impossible to disband the forces of Kalmikow, Semenoff, and  others;  and, when the&apos;Princes  Islandproposals had changed public opinion, he decided to include their  troops in a  generalFar  East force.     The Japanese. On the  8th  May  Colonel Robertson transmitted [No. 428] atelegram sent from Omsk by Mr. Hodgson, who reported that in circles which supported the government the&apos; Japanese  continued to  win sympathy, and that even  those  whotill recently  were  refractory were being won over to them for  instance, GeneralRomanoffski.     Repression   of   Bolsheviks  in the  Yenesei district. On  the  3rd May  ColonelRobertson telegraphed from  Vladivostock [No. 416]  saying that a report had  beenreceived from  the vice-consul  at  Krasnoyask to the  effect  that numerous  orders hadbeen issued by the governor-general of  Yenesei in  regard  to the Bolsheviks ; by oneorder those in prison  were to  be held as hostages, and twenty of them  shot for everyBolshevik crime committed in the district, and  by another those assisting the Bolshevikswere to be shot without trial.  The  vice-consul had been  asked by delegates of thesocial democratic and social  revolutionary parties  to  procure  a modification of these orders,- on the ground that they were unjust, and that many of  those who  had foughtagainst Bolshevism would be alienated by the injustice.     Telegraphing again on the 9th May, Colonel Robertson reported that an order hadbeen issued recently by General Ivanoff Rinoff  that for each act of Bolshevik terrorism
ten hostages should be shot, the  hostages  being taken from  sympathizers with theBolsheviks.    Attempt on General Horvat&apos;s  life.-Colonel Robertson reported from Vladivostockon the 2nd May that  on the  previous  day two bombs  had been thrown at GeneralHorvat  in  the  street,  but the general  had not been injured.  Two  men  had been arrested, one of them was  an ex-convict.    The Social  Revolutionaries. Telegraphing  from Vladivostock on  the  9th May,Colonel Robertson said [No. 432] that the Social  Revolutionaries had become very muchfrightened of Bolshevism  and the Czechs : they realized  that they were not strong-enough  to force anybody&apos;s hand, and that if they tried to do so their position would beprecarious.  They were, it would seem, chiefly responsible for the secret meetings of the delegates of dumas and  zemstvos at the end of March, which decreed that the Omskgovernment was  too reactionary, and determined that an ultimatum should be sent toit demanding the early convocation at Irkutsk of all dumas and zemstvos.  The telegramconveying this demand had been ignored, and since then the position had changed.                                    POLAND.    Jewish Feeling against the Allies. On  the 11th May, Sir Charles Marling reported[No. 1114] that much bitterness against the  allies was being caused in Jewish circles bya telegram  from Kovno stating that terrible pogroms had signalled  the  entry of thePolish  army into Vilna.  This telegram  had been  received via Berlin by the Zionistbureau.                                    TURKEY.    The Maritsa- Kara Su  District. On  the  11th May, Admiral Calthorpe reported[No. 1014] a conversation with the grand vizier in regard to the Moslems of the districtbetween  the Maritsa and the Kara Su, estimated by the latter to  be 300,000 out of a population of 350,000.  The grand  vizier said  that they had sent delegates to Paris,who had telegraphed to him from  Rome saying that, on President Wilson&apos;s principle ofself-determination, they desired  to govern  themselves and for  that purpose to  found are public ; they had too asked for his assistance.   It would be a relief to leave a  Moslembody under its own administration, should  the  Ottoman government be expelled from europe ;  but otherwise the idea was, of course, not a  congenial one to that government.    Italians at Rodosto. On the 7th May Sir  Rennell Rodd reported [No.  323] thata telegram from Constantinople to a Turin  newspaper had announced that an  Italianbattalion had land ed at Rodosto on the Sea of Marmora.    Telegraphing to Admiral Calthorpe  on the 10th May [No. 1001], Lord Curzoninformed him that the Italian battalion had  reached Rodosto about a month previouslyand had been placed under General Milne&apos;s orders.ANATOLIA..    Greeks and Italians. On the 10th May Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed [No. 997]that a report had  been  received  from  Smyrna that, at some  manifestation  which,contrary to  a strict  Italian prohibition, had  taken place on  the 20th April at a villagenamed Villa Nova, a Greek priest and  his niece  had been  bayonetted  by  soldiers andkilled.   About 100  Greeks were in prison for political offences.  A vigorous campaign against the  Greeks  was being conducted  by the  Italians, who would not allow any ofthem to cross to the islands.                           SYRIA AND  PALESTINE.    Zionism  and  the  Mandate.- On the  2nd May  General  Clayton  transmitted[No. C. 155] a report from the  chief administrator in  Palestine in  regard to the visit of the commission of enquiry.    That official explained  that when he spoke of  the Zionist programme, he meantthe comparatively  moderate programme presented  to the  peace conference,  not theviews of certain extreme advocates of Zionism..    The people of  Palestine, he said, wanted their country for themselves, and wouldresist  by   every  means  in their power,  including  active  hostilities,  any  general
 immigration of Jews, however gradual it might be ;  and if the Zionist programme  was a necessary adjunct to a mandate, there  was no doubt, in the present state of political feeling, France or the United States would be preferred as the mandatory or as tlie protecting power of an Arab administration.   Great Britain  was believed to be more systematically committed  to the Zionist programme than the other two, and  both Arab and (? French) propaganda had been actively engaged  in  fostering this  view for some months past.  More speedy autonomy was expected  from the United States ; India and Egypt being quoted as examples  of  the tenacity of Great Britain&apos;s hold on countries on which she once laid her hand.  Moreover, people had been greatly impressed by recent events in Egypt.     The main issue, however, was the fear  of Zionism by both Christian and Moslem, and as long as that fear lasted the commission would be unable to gauge the wishes of the people ; those wishes  would appear to be ag-ainst the British mandate, though were their fear removed  a  large  majority would vote for it.   But  the  idea that Great Britain was the main  upholder of the  Zionist programme would preclude any  local request for a British - mandate ; and no mandatory power could&apos; carry through  the Zionist programme save by force, and by suppressing the wishes of the large majority of the people of Palestine.     If a  mandate  were  desired for Great Britain  an authoritative  announcement should be made that the Zionist programme would not be  enforced in opposition to  the wishes of the majority, and this was the only means of getting a clear  and unbiassed expression of their wishes.     To this General Clayton added a few words on his own account.   He said that no amount of persuasion or propaganda would dispel the ever-growing fear and distrust of Zionist aims.   At present the news of the  impending commission  had calmed  the situation, but quite recently there  had been danger of serious disturbances, in which Arabs from the east of Jordan were to take part the political  officer in that district had reported  violent anti-Jewish sentiment, and  open  threats of  active  hostility. Were  a mandate given to  Great Britain  on  the lines of the  Zionist  programme, a military force, and that greater than the existing one, would have  to be retained in Palestine for an indefinite period.     He  considered the  chief administrators report  a  true  appreciation of  the situation.                               THE ARMENIANS.     Moslem Menace. -On the 10th May Mr. Gaisford reported  from Borne [No.  59]that the Vatican  had heard from  Constantinople that the Armenian population in asia minor was menaced by a hostile movement which was developing, and in which Moslemofficials and notables were taking part.   The cardinal secretary of state appealed to hismajesty s government for the protection of the  Armenians, who had already suffered somuch from the war.     Action of the French General  in the Adana Vilayet. On the 11th  May Admiral Calthorpe reported [No. 1008] that, according to the grand vizier, the Armenians in theAdana vilayet were shut up  in the town and reduced to a condition  of great distress. The French general insisted on this treatment; but the vali had  reported to  the grand vizier that they desired to go back to their homes and, in his opinion, should be allowed to do so.     Protests from the Caucasus.   On  the 12th May,  Sir  Percy  Cox transmitted [No. 349] the following portion of a telegram from Tabriz:      I  was  interviewed yesterday by three notables of [place uudecypherable1,  who begged me to lay their case before you.     They said  that they had come here  as  a deputation  from Tartars between [place undecypherable J  and Julfa,  to implore  the Persian government to  take over  their country and save them from the Armenians.     They said that when the British first came to Nakhchivan they promised that, until. the fate of the Caucasus  had been decided at the peace conference, they  would be  left to govern themselves ; but that now the Armenian government  of [? Erivan omitted] had published a notice saying that with the approval of the British military authorities they were taking over the country as far as Julfa and would shortly be in Nakhchivan. Thej? added that  we had  no idea how impossible it  was for them to  live with and  be governed by Armenians, whom they outnumbered by at least four to one.
     If the peace conference decided [? that their] provinces were to be part of new Armenia they would submit, and would then beg for one month in which to evacuate; but meanwhile they begged that the status quo should not be altered.                                  KURDISTAN.     Agitation. On the 12th May Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed [No.  1017] that the grand vizier had informed him of  the receipt of unsatisfactory reports in regard to Kurdish affairs.  Anxiety at the continued advance of British troops had, he. said, been expressed by the Milli and other tribes, whom he had ordered to be informed that our troops were only advancing  with  the  intention of  establishing  order  and   good administration, and that  therefore they were to be helped in every way.  For his own part,  Admiral  Calthorpe  repeated  that, in his opinion,  the  fear  of falling  under Armenian rule was the  chief cause of the agitation among the Kurds.     Recommendations  of the  peace  delegation. On the  14th  May  Lord  Curzon informed  [No. . 828]  Admiral  Calthorpe  that it  had been suggested  by the  peace delegation that, pending the decision of the conference, he should confine his efforts to advising the  Kurds  to  remain quiet and  to desist from  agitation.   It had also suggested  that a  private  assurance  might  be  given by Major  Noel  that Kurdish interests were  not being lost sight  of by the conference,  and  that  the policy  to be pursued  would not be  vindictive.  Lord  Curzon added that it was proposed by the civil commissioner in. Baghdad that a  general amnesty  on  lines suggested by Major Noel  should be proclaimed in all Kurdish districts within  the limits of the  vilayet, from which their own conclusions would be drawn by those dwelling outside Mosul and the vilayet,     Proposals of Shaykh Whithall. On the 12th May the political  officer at Baghdad reported the  arrival at  that  place of Shaykh Whithall (&quot;uncle  of Abdul Qadir),  who exercised a greater  influence  than any other individual  with  the Kurds of. central Kurdistan and  north-west Persia; this was the opinion of the  political officers on  the spot, aud it was confirmed by the naqib of Baghdad.     He, the political officer, had had long interviews with Shaykh Whithall, who said that he had come to Baghdad with the object of pressing for  a united Kurdistan (including the Kurds  now in Persia), which he  wished to be  under the protection  of Great Britain.     Shaykh Whithall was very much disappointed when it was explained to him that, in so far as the Persian Kurds were concerned, he could not  look to Great Britain for help in realizing his objects.   He said that the separation from Persia was bound to come in any event;  but he accented the position, and declared  that he was ready te help us in every way to establish the regime  in Kurdistan, which  was  wished for by  himself and his friends.   There were, however, some points on  which he  asked  to be  satisfied : That there should be large autonomous groups, but no single chief over the  Kurds; that their country should not be placed  under the domination of either  Nestorians or Armenians, and that the repatriation of Christians should be  conditional on this;  that the same material assistance as in Iraq should be provided by the British government; and that there  should be an amnesty.                                    PERSIA.    Sowlet-ed-Boxoleh. On the 10th May Sir Percy Cox reported [No. 344] that an intimation  had  been received from  the  government of India, that a  settlement with Sowlet-ed-Dowleh through the shaykh of Mohammerah  had been authorised by his majesty&apos;s government, and that officers had been instructed by the government of Indiato proceed with the business.    Sowlet, however, had migrated,  and at the end of April had appeared  at  Baiza, some thirty miles from Shiraz, whence he had sent his son with a letter of submission to the governor-general.    Recognising that further  military  coercion  was out of  the question, that Sowlet-ed-Dowleh would  probably refuse to go to  Mahommerah, and that he disliked the idea of going to Teheran, the governor-general had asked the consul to ascertain his, Sir Percy  Cox&apos;s,  views  unofficially as to  giving Sowlet a  governorship ; should this idea not commend itself, he advdsecl that  Sowlet  should be called upon to live on his estates, to leave his son at  Shiraz, and to  deposit 5,000/.  He, Sir Percy,had replied that the  public effect  of  Sowlet being  given  a governorship  would be
deplorable, and if the governor-general were convinced that the Mohammerah solutionwas impossible, he was in favour of the proposed terms, a 10,000Z.  deposit, however,being exacted instead of one of 5,000Z.                                AFGHANISTAN.    Inroad into India. On  the  8th  May the  India  Office  issued,  the following statement :     Official statements have  been issued from time  to time on the  subject of recent events in Afghanistan.  The state of that country has given cause for anxiety for sometime past, because it was hardly to be expected  that the unrest  consequent upon  the murder of the late ameer and the dispute over  the  succession would fail to react uponthe north-west frontier  of India.    From reports received from the government of India during the last few days itappears that apprehensions on this score  have been realised.  Armed bodies of Afghans,including apparently regular troops  purporting to act under the orders of  the  Afghangovernment, have crossed the frontier at several points in the neighbourhood  of theKhyber [the pass leading from Peshawar  to  Afghanistan], and have occupied  BaghSprings, Tor Tsappar, and Spinatsuka [in the hills to the north of the pass, and about25 miles from Peshawar] on the &quot;Indian  side.   Further  movements of Afghan  troopstowards the frontier are also reported.    The government  of India  are  taking active steps to expel  the  intruders and todeal  firmly with  any  developments  that  may arise.  The troops  detailed for  thispurpose  have been placed under the command of General Barrett.   It is anticipatedthat they will have no difficulty in  carrying out  their task.  The  attitude of the tribeson the British side of the border is  reported to be satisfactory.    The viceroy has addressed a strong letter of remonstrance to the  ameer,  calling upon  him to take immediate steps to restrain his subjects.    On the 12th May a second statement was issued :     Since  the  official  statement  was published  on  the  8 th   in regard to recent developments on the Afghan border, further telegrams have been received from thegovernment of India on the subject.    On the  9th  May  the  government of  India reported  that the  Afghans  were receiving large  reinforcements and had advanced  their  positions to the heights ofAshrafai Khel, overlooking Landi Kotal.     On the 10th the government of India telegraphed as follows :      On the morning of the 9th May our advanced forces  at Landi Kotal expelled         Afghans from  positions in  vicinity of that locality.  Aeroplanes co-operated        . and bombed  Loi Dakka  with good results.  Enemy are still in position to         the west about kharre Gali.  Our casualties were slight.     The section of the frontier adjoining the  Khyber has never  been  demarcated.But Landi Kotal is indisputably on the  British side, and  in advancing to its vicinity the afghans have committed a  deliberate  act of invasion,  for which they had received no provocation whatever.     Some unrest is reported in the city of Peshawar, where martial law was proclaimedon the 8th May.  A number of arrests have been made with good results.     Enver  Bey. On the 12th May the  viceroy  reported that there was a rumour  that,after  a flight through Russia, Enver Bey had joined the  Afghan forces.
