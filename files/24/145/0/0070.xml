General Horvat. On the  14th  July Mr.  0&apos;Reilly, telegraphing [No. 627] fromVladivostock, transmitted  a  telegram sent from  Omsk three  days earlier.  In this itwas  reported that the removal of General  Borvat from his present post had beendecided upon by  the  government, the removal however  was  to be effected with allpossible honour.   It was  said in Omsk that General Horvat had lost his local influence and  had become entirely  inefficient.  He had been especially blamed for allowing alarge number of officers to avoid service at the front and to remain at Vladivostock.   Itwas  intended to assimilate the  administration of the Far East to that of other parts ofSiberia, with the usual posts both civil  and military.   General  Rozanoff would  beappointed  commander-in-chief :  he was a reactionary but a man of good  standing and ability.     General Kolchak and Finland. On  the 15th  July  Mr.  0&apos;Reilly  transmitted[No. 623] a message sent from Omsk on the 10th July by Sir Charles Eliot.  The highcommissioner reported  that  the answer to  the proposed Finland agreement dependedentirely on the personal  decision of Admiral  Kolchak who had not then returned fromthe front:  but the.council of ministers simply  said in answer to all arguments that theycould not  risk the unpopularity of recognizing the independence of Finland at present,in spite  of the fact that its independence might be a fait accompli.  Sir  Charles Eliotthought  that they  were not only afraid of the result of such recognition in Siberia butalso  of the effect it might have on General Denikin&apos;s army.     On  the following  day Mr. 0&apos;Reilly transmitted [No. 633] another telegram fromSir Charles  Eliot, sent on the  11th  July.   In this  he said that he had seen GeneralKolchak and had &apos; discussed the  proposed agreement with him.  The general had saidthat it might be supposed that Finland had conquered Russia : he described the proposal as fantastic.  He had pointed  out too that he was not a monarch and that the Britishgovernment could not expect him to usurp the power which belonged only to the futureconstituent assembly, objecting as it did to his supposed re-actionary tendencies : at thesame time he  was  prepared  to deal  with the government of Finland and to show itevery friendly courtesy.     Sir  Charles Eliot added that after careful consideration a written answer would begiven  by Admiral Kolchak, but he was not hopeful of gaining anything more from himthan an assurance that he  would be ready to treat with the Finnish government as apractically independent power.
    Bolshevik  reverses in  the  West  and South. The following  Bolshevik  militarycommunique was sent out by wireless on the 22nd July :     South of the Baltic (Narva-Petrograd) railway line, on the sector of Bolotny,  our troops are consolidating their positions at the villages  of Mazana  and Gorka Osmino,33 miles to the north-west of Luga.    In the region  of Pskoff, under  enemy pressure, our troops have abandoned  thestation of Toroshino.  The  enemy&apos;s  advance between the river Tcherekhaia  and  thePskoff-Polotsk railway has been stopped  at the line  of villages  14 miles from Pskoff.Along the Pskoff-Ostroff railway line we have occupied a  series of villages three miles south of the station of Cherskov.    In the direction of Molodtcheno  (on  the Vilna-Minsk  railway) under enemypressure,  we have retired to a line three miles to the west of the village of Dubroff.    In the direction of Kovel we have abandoned Sarny (80 miles east of Ivovel on  therailway to Kieff).   In the direction of Mogilleff-Podolsk we have abandoned Varniarka.    In the region of Ekatermoslav we are fighting two miles to the south and six miles to the west of Ekaterinoslav.    In the Kharkoft&apos; direction,  under enemy  pressure, we have  abandoned the stationof Koloniak.  In the Povorino  direction  fierce fighting is proceeding.    In the region of Kamyshin we have occupied the village of Talovka, 33 miles tothe south-west of Kamyshin.   Our  cavalry  captured two  guns, machine-guns, shells,and impedimenta.   On the left bank of the volga our troops have  re-occupied a seriesof villages 56 miles to the south of Kamyshin.    Mutiny at  Archangel. The following statement was issued by the War Office onthe 23rd Julv :     General Ironside at Archangel reports  that a mutiny amongst the Russian troopshas taken place.    The chief parts of the front affected are the Onega front, where there  were no british troops,  and on the railway front,  where there was a small detachment of British,and where the  mutiny did not mature.    In the Onega area the mutineers have  handed over the front and the town to  theenemy.  On the railway front the Bolsheviks attacked while our troops were taking overthe line from the, mutineers, but were repulsed.    The mutiny was due to Bolshevik propaganda, and was brought to a head by  therealization that we were  withdrawing  from  North  Russia  and  that the  gradualevacuation had already begun.   A considerable number of the Russian troops apparentlydecided that their only hope was to go over to the Bolsheviks.    General Ironside now has the situation in hand, and the  fresh  British volunteertroops, who are, fortunately, upon the spot, are believed to be equal to their difficult and perilous task.    [The Times notes that the Onega  sector of the Archangel front lies west of  theport of Archangel,, and follows closely the southern  shore of the  White Sea ;  general ironside by this route maintaining connexion with the Murmansk front.   The town ofOnega is  at the mouth of the river of the same name.    The  &quot; railway front&quot; lies between Onega and Archangel, the advanced post on therailway held by the allies being about 90 miles south-east of Onega.]     Provisional Government of Northern Territory to Resign. On  the 15th JulyMr.  Hoare telegraphing [No.  472] from  Archangel  reported that  the provisionalgovernment had decided that the time had come to resign and to place its power in thehands of the  governor-general who  had been  appointed commander-in-chief of  theRussian forces by  Admiral Kolcbak.   No  announcement of  the resignation would however be made pending the latter&apos;s  approval.   Mr. Hoare added that he understood from Mr. Yermolotf, whose opinion he trusted more than that of anyone else, that the main object of  the change was to  get rid of the incompetents, and that [? British merchants]who  had been sounded were  in  favour of it.   The incapacity  of the ministers  had caused general dissatisfaction, and if General  [? Miller]  succeeded  as he hoped to do inenlisting  the services of competent  persons  to  act  as advisers to  himself the change would certainly do  no harm.                                    TURKEY.     Situation in the Smyrna Vilayet. On the 16th July Admiral Calthorpe transmitted[No.  1475] the following report received from Commodore Fisher at Smyrna : -     1st.  The following places  were occupied by Greek troops despite the instructions of the allied  council : -The   whole of  Kazas, of  Magnesia  and Cassaba, and  the
 Meander valley  as far  south as Nazilli.  There  was  no reasonable excuse  for this occupation except in the cases of the towns of Magnesia and Cassaba which are strategic points.  The  following places outside the limits laid down by the allied council are still in Greek occupation : The towns of Magnesia and Cassaba, the Meander valley as far as and including Aidin, together with a few miles of territory east of Kazas.     The following are cases of the Greeks disobeying my instructions : (a.) The occupa- tion of Ak-Hissar ;  (6.) The occupation of the  Ayasulok-Aidin railway line ; (c.) Waging warfare  across the Meander river as far south as Girova ;  (d.) The unprovoked attack on venizolos-Chiflik, north-east of Magnesia;  (c)  The occupation of Aidin.     2nd. I entirely disagree  with, the new  limits proposed by M.  Venezelos, which appear to be actuated by political motives, and will cause  much further bloodshed and transfer  the present unrest still further eastward into the country.  In any case the limits suggested by him are unwieldy and almost  impossible to  hold.  I suggest  that the following limits be adopted :  The sandjak of Smyrna (within which the Greeks can take up  any disposition convenient) as  at present, except  that the southern limit will run due  east from the sea coast to Ayasoluk and then follow  the railway line as far south as Azizie and then run east  to the frontier of the sandjak.   The reason for this extension is that the important tunnels north  of Azizie may be guarded.   Additional territory :  In the north the  present line occupied by  the Greek  troops, viz. :  from a point on sea coast seven miles north-east of Aivali and from thence  in  a  south-easterly direction to the frontier of the sandjak  of Smyrna at or about [? Bozdagh(i)].     In the neighbourhood of Magnesia and Cassaba : the western and southern limits to be the frontier of the sandjak of Smyrna, the northern limit the  Gedis  Chai river, the eastern limit a straight line running  north  and south drawn through a  point two miles  east of Cassaba from  the  Gedis Chai  river on  the north to a position east of Ovajik on the frontier of the sandjak of Smyrna.     These limits give the Greeks slightly more territory  and in addition provide them with very good strategical, points for the defence of Smyrna;  if they are  approved I suggest that I may be given discretionary power to alter the above limits to  tbe extent of one or two miles if found advisable for  military reasons.     I am not in favour of a mixed commission of Turkish and Greek officers, which I consider would be a failure.     It  is  my   considered  opinion  that  unless  the  limits  as  above specified  are approximately adopted and the territory in the Meander  valley restored to the Turks, a peaceful occupation on the part of the Greeks will be  impossible.   But that if  the Greeks return to the proposed limits and the Turks are informed of the decision of the conference organised attacks will cease.     The evacuation of Aidin by the Greeks, if approved,  must not be carried out until arrangements can be  made  for  regular Turkish troops  to occupy the place : I should propose that the  Greek and the Turkish  governments  be  informed as to this and that the evacuation be carried out under my personal supervision.     The foregoing suggestions are dependent on  the Greeks observing the  status quo until a decision is reached.  If they will not, many complications will  ensue.     In regard to these suggestions Admiral Calthorpe said :      I fully  endorse the commodore&apos;s remarks  and  urge that his proposals be adopted.     I concur in  considering  that Monsieur Venezelos&apos;  estimate of Turkish troops opposed to Greeks might not be very greatly exaggerated.     I do not estimate Turkish regular troops  at more than 2,000.     Tbe  remainder consists  of irregulars whose  numbers  are naturally  difficult to compute.     They have been brought into being owing to  the extension of the Greek advance, and  their  numbers will  probably automatically decrease  in proportion as  the  Greeks remain on the defensive within their prescribed limits.   It must be remembered that all able-bodied men  who possess or can  acquire arms take the field as soon as their  area appears  to  be  threatened.   Whatever may  be decided,  I would  strongly  urge  that identic instructions should be sent by the British, French, and Italian governments totheir high commissioners here with orders to present a joint note to the Sublime Porte.     The Greek Army. On the 20th July Admiral Calthorpe reported [No.  1499] that Commodore Fisher had been informed by  the  Greek high  commissioner that the greek army,  pending  a  further  decision of  the allied  council,  had assumed  free  actionoutside the Smyrna Sandjak, and  that  this had been done by  the direct  order  ofMr. Venezelos.     On the following day Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No.  1503] a  message from
 Mr.  Morgan reporting  that  the commodore had been informed  by the Greek high commissioner that for  the  present  the  Greek troops to the east  of Aidin  would hot advance beyond Keushk      Italians and  Greeks. In  a message transmitted by  Admiral  Calthorpe on the 21st July [No.  1503] Mr. Morgan reported that,  according to information which had been  received  from  the British naval  representative  at Adalia,  the  anti-Hellenic movement had been  encouraged by Italians, and further that he had received from the Turks a written protest against the presence of the Italians,  who  were not  wanted by them in Asia Minor.                                     ABABIA.      The Message  to King Hussein. [E.R. CXX1X, p. 4].   On the 18th July General Allenby informed  Lord Curzon that the message to King Hussein had been  delivered, and  that  the king  had replied that it appeared  to him that  he had  been entirely deserted by his majesty&apos;s government.  He  wished to know whether he  was to under- stand that in r-egard  to the  matters  in dispute between  him  and Ibn  Saud no further action would be taken by the British government.     The Evacuation of Hodeidah. On  the 12th July  General  Allenby reported [No. .1102] that should the  Imam Yahya ask Colonel Jacob when his majesty&apos;s govern- ment were going to evacuate Hodeidah, the  latter proposed to reply that  the  town would be evacuated as soon  as his majesty&apos;s government  was  convinced of the Imam&apos;s ability to impose his  peaceful  rule therein.     To this Lord  Curzon replied on the 21st  July  [No.  862] that he  was content to leave it to Colonel Jacob&apos;s discretion whether he should reply  as he  had proposed or alternatively somewhat on the following lines :      &quot; Pending the conclusion of peace with Turkey, and of a treaty between the Imam and his majesty&apos;s  government, the question  of military  movements is  decided by the military authorities, and Colonel Jacob can only undertake  to represent  to  them any wishes which the Imam may express on the subject.&quot;     Idrisi&apos;s Attitude. On  the 18th  July General Allenby  transmitted [No. 1122] a message from General Clayton sent from Aden on the previous day.  General Clayton reported that he had visited Idrisi who welcomed British territorial arbitration, his only complaint being  in regard to the delay in giving it effect.  It was clear that  he had no idea  of looking elsewhere for  protection.   He  volunteered that, if  the   other Arab rulers would do the same,  he would accept and support  the nominal, though not the effective, suzerainty of King Hussein : and he was ready to enter into  close relations with the king if the latter would agree to a just settlement of the Kunfida question, and in that event he would bind himself to attack Ibn Saud  if King Hussein  should be again attacked by  him.   He complained bitterly, however, of our discouragement of his expansion southwards.                               . AFGHANISTAN.   -     The Peace Negotiations. On the 21st July the viceroj&apos;- telegraphed [Nos.  1068 and 1070  S] the translation of a  letter received from the amir, in the course  of which it was stated that the Afghan delegation would reach the British lines on the 24th July.  The amir  further said that the chief of  the delegation would  be his brother, Ali Ahmad Khan, minister for home affairs.     This letter from the amir coupled with  the dispersal of the Afridi gathering had, the viceroy said, cleared  the air.   From a  previous telegram  I No. 9730], sent by him on the 18th July, the situation appeared to be serious as he  reported that the amir wasnot only failing to comply  with the armistice terms but was actively violating them inregard to his dealings with the frontier tribes.    Bolsheviks  at Herat. On  the  11th July the viceroy  transmitted a report  fromGeneral Malleson notifying him that, according to news  received from Karez,  about the 1st July  a Bolshevik  mission arrived at Herat accompanied by  30 Bolshevik cavalryand 120 pony loads of arms and ammunition.   The party also included a German officer and a few Austrians who were said to be expert manufacturers of field equipment.
