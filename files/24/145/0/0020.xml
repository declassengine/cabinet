Archangel. -On the 2nd August Mr.  Lindiey telegraphed [No. 51] that  our troops had, without any  casualties, taken  possession of Archangel.   On the following clayMr. Young telegraphed from Archangel  [No. 114] that the collapse of the  Bolshevikson the arrival of the allied force had been so complete  that their overthrow had been almost bloodless.   Power was temporarily  in the hands of a &quot; supreme dictatorate of thenorthern region.&quot;   Mr. Young also said that the Bolsheviks  had arrested the alliedconsuls late  on the 1st  August, but  they  had been  at  once  freed  by the  new administration.     Mr. Lindley&apos;s Movements. On the  30th July Mr. Lindiey telegraphed as follows[No.  43] :  As you have  probably  received  no  telegrams from  me at  Vologda I had better resume events.     I  arrived at Vologda on the 7th July,  the day after the  [? murder  of the  omitted]German Ambassador  and  the  rising  at  Yaroslav.  Three  days  later  the sovietGovernment  began its efforts to force the allied representatives to go to Moscow.   Theyvery properly refused when the situation  was so  [? obscure] and the-German demands were still unknown.  M.  Radek then came to Vologda with  orders to take us by force to Moscow..   He did not carry out his orders and left on the 17th July.     After his departure a system of badgering was  started.  Guards  were placed overthe [group undecypherable] s and various  [ ? similar] measures were taken with a viewto making our position at  Vologda  untenable.   All  telegrams  in cypher from abroadwere held up.  These tactics made it impossible for me to  go to Moscow as I wished and intended.   To  have done so would  have compromised  the position  taken up by us.Moreover, we knew that the Bolsheviks  were not acting in good  faith.    These considerations did not apply  to the economic  mission which left for moscow on the 17th  July with a written  guarantee from M.  Radek that it would be allowed toleave  when it liked.  The same guarantee was offered to  me, but for the reasons abovestated I. did not accept the invitation.
     July 23rd.   The United States Ambassador, who had been in constant communica-^ tion with  M. Chicherin, received  from him a telegram  saying that it was positively dangerous to stay another day at Vologda, and again asking us to go to Moscow,.  &quot;We agreed that our position was untenable, and replied that,  in  view  of his opinion, we would leave at once for Archangel.     After further telegrams permission was accorded,  provided we  understood that we could not stay at Archangel.  We agreed,  and M. Chicherin promised to facilitate our journey by ships.     We left&apos;Vologda on the 24th July and arrived at Archangel on the 26th July.  The local authorities met us and told  us that  a [? ship was nearly] ready.  We demanded leave to telegraph to our Governments and to summon allied [? escort].  These requests were referred to Moscow, but the answer was not communicated to us until the afternoon of  the  27th July.  Both  requests were  refused, but the soviet agreed to give  us two ships and a trawler.     In the meantime we had learnt from a secret source that MM.  Lenin  and Trotsky had issued order for our detention, evidently believing that we meant to bring about a complete rupture,  which they are anxious to avoid for various reasons.  I therefore sent for the  captain of the only British ship in port&apos; and made provisional arrangements  for our leaving in spite of contrary orders.     The local soviet decided not to obey Moscow, and later changed their  opinion once again.   This change may have been .,due to a telegram which  I sent  to Mr. Ransome [? for] M.  Radek, saying I  did not consider my departure  as in any way changing the relations which existed between the soviet power and His Majesty&apos;s Government.     In any case, two boats were prepared  for us, and we  left with a  trawler escort on the 29 th July.     The economic mission  arrived at Archangel  a few hours  before  we left, and the whole party was embarked.     I  much regret 1  did not succeed in getting further than Vologda,  but all my colleagues  opposed the idea most vehemently, and I trust you will  agree circumstancesmade it impossible.  To have left my colleagues would have been regarded, and rightly, as an act of disloyalty.     On the 5th August Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Lindley [No. 18] approving  his action in regard to Moscow.     Mr. Lindley&apos;s Opinion of the Situation. In another telegram [No.. 44], also senton  the 30th July, Mr. Lindley said that the bulk of the population  were heartily  sick ofthe Bolsheviks, who, outside Moscow and Petrograd, had  lost nearly all their influence.They had  now to  rely almost  entirely on terrorism  and on the support of foreignmercenaries backed by prisoners of war.  With these forces they had up to  the present been able to quell local risings, unsupported from outside.   The bitter animosity againstthe Germans, inevitably raised Whenever  they showed themselves, had increased thenumber of our supporters, who now included the  majority of the best elements  in thecountry.  These elements had shaken off some of their apathy  and  resignation to fate,and were organised much more effectively,     M. Lenin declares that Russia  is  at  War  with  the   Allies. Mr.  Lockharttelegraphed on  (?) the 1st  August  [No. 347]  giving   an English  translation of atelegram prepared in French by the representatives of the allied countries in Moscow. Mr. Lockhart, in  union with the  consuls-general of France,  America, and Italy, had demanded  from  M. Chicherin an explanation of a declaration made by M. Lenin, at.a public meeting of the soviet, to  the effect that  a state of war  existed between the Russian Republic  and  the allied  Powers; that  is,  M.  Chicherin was asked to say whether this  was to be taken as a definite declaration of war,  with the  necessary consequences  of the breaking off of relations and  the departure of the  consuls.  In reply, M.  Chicherin said that he interpreted the  declaration as meaning the existence-of. a state  of defence rather than a  state  of war, and that, as had  been the case in analogous  circumstances  with Germany,  the Government desired not  to break  off relations.   Those present requested that  M.  Lenin should himself  publicly give this explanation, of which they reserved their criticism : and they declared further that they felt obliged to join this question with that  of  the departure of the military missions, adding that if this were not satisfactorily settled without delay they could only conclude that a state of war did actually exist.   M.  Chicherin  undertook to give a reply  within,three clays.                                                        .         .   &apos;    &apos;
     Resolutions  of  Russian  Communists. The  Russian  Government  sent  out  a wireless message on the 1st August in  which they  stated  that the northern regional conference of the Russian  Communist  party,  representing  two organisations  with  a membership of over 22,000, had passed the following resolutions : In view&apos;of the present political situation, when the Russian socialist revolution is encircled by an iron band of imperialistic robbers,  it is necessary as a consequence to carry out  with no  delay  the following measures : -     1.  The creation of an army of the classes  composed  of  the working  men in  the towns and the poorer peasants,  which must become thoroughly  acquainted with the technicalities  of warfare ;     2.  The mobilisation of  all the technical forces of the country for the creation of this well-trained Red army ;     3.  The formation in all  detachments of the  Red  army in the towns  of  groups composed of the Communists,  who will strengthen revolutionary fighting discipline,  and who will have vigilant control over the experts ;     4.  The training on a large scale of all workmen and  the poorer peasants who are not in the Red army.     After a discussion of the food question,  the conference is of opinion that, with the view to struggling successfully against possible famine, the reform of all  methods of food distribution is necessary, especially bread, which has been  made a source  of profit for the bourgeoisie and the occasion for the exploitation of the workmen and peasants.     Freedom of trade,  arbitrary prices,  and private initiative in the procuring  and distribution of  food  are  condemned by experience  in  the most emphatic manner. The  bourgeoisie has failed.   The  only salvation from  famine  is  in the  following measures :      1.  A severely applied monopoly in corn, meat, and other products ;     2.  Fixed identical prices throughout the whole of Russia for  corn  and other food products ;     3.  Fixed prices for articles of first necessity, such&apos;as clothes, shoes, and soap;     4.  The energetic organisation of communal kitchens ;     5.  The complete prohibition in ali  towns of the private distribution  of food, and, instead,  the   distribution  of food for the  whole population  by means of  a  central organisation ;     6.  All products of this and the last harvest, after making provision for  those who have worked oil the land and for their families and  cattle, must be handed over, at  a fixed price, throughout Russia, to the Commissariat for Food;     7.  Seeds  for the next harvest  must   be  brought in for  storage, in  the State granaries ;     8.  The conference believes that the  struggle against famine can only be successful by complete harmony among the workmen and poorer peasants ;     9.  All  who oppose  the  policy  of  the Council  of   the  People&apos;s Commissaries, willingly or unwillingly, are the enemies of the people.     The Government and Anti-Semitism.-The following wireless message was sent out on the 30th July from  Petrograd: The Council  of  the  People&apos;s Commissioners  has issued a decree against Anti-Semitism within the Russian Federal Republic, where the principle of the right of self-determination has been proclaimed for the.working classes of all peoples.    - The decree states that there  is no place  for national  oppression, and  that  the Jewish  bourgeoisie is our enemy, not as Jews, but as bourgeoisie.   To us every  Jewish workman is a  brother.  No agitation against any nation is permissible  ; it  is criminaland shameful.                                                                   ..  .     The Council of the  People&apos;s Commissioners declares  the Anti-Semitic  movement and all  pogroms  of the-Jews as prejudicial to the  revolution  of. the workmen  and peasants, and  it invites the  working classes of socialist Russia to fight  by every means against  this clanger.  National antagonism brings to our ranks feebleness, indiscriminately breaks up our national detachments, and only serves our enemies.     The Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners instructs ali Soviets of deputies to take energetic measures  against this Anti-Semitism.   All creators  of pogroms, and  all Anti- Semitic agitators must be regarded as outlaws.
UKRAINA.     Assassination of Field-Marshal  von Fiehhorn. On the  31st July  the  GermanGovernment sent out the  following wireless  message announcing the assassination ofField-Marshal&apos; von  Eichhorn and suggesting the  complicity  of the Entente :   Thecommander-in-chief  of the German troops in occupation in Ukrain, Field-Marshal vonEichhorn, has fallen  a victim to a political assassination.  As Eichhorn, on the 30th July,at 2 P.M., was going  home from the Casino with his aide-de-camp, Captain von Dressier,a man who was coming towards them in a  cab  threw bombs,  which caused seriousinjuries to them both, from which they died in the course of the day.   The assassin andthe driver were arrested.  The accompanying circumstances point clearly to the crimeoriginating with the Social Democratic party in  Moscow, behind which  the  Ententestands, as is known by experience.  According to information  received up to the presentthe assassin&apos;s name is Boris  Donzkio ;  he is 22 years of age,  and admits that he  is a confidential agent of the Moscow  Revolutionary  Socialists,  whose central committeeordered him to kill  the field-marshal, and provided him with bombs, a revolver, and money for the purpose.THE CAUCASUS.     Baku. Telegraphing on the 30th July [No. 346] Mr. Loekhart said that the Bakusoviet had decided to call in the English ; the proposal had gained 203 votes out of  226.A  coalition Government had been formed including all parties up to the Cadets.     From a telegram received by the War Office from General  Dunsterville it appearsthat the coup d&apos;etat took place on the 25th July.SIBERIA.     Intervention. - In view of its coming intervention in Siberia, on the 2nd August thefollowing declaration was published  by the Japanese  Government :  The  JapaneseGovernment, actuated by sentiments  of sincere  friendship towards the Rnssian people,have always entertained the most sanguine hopes of the speedy re-establishment of orderin Russia and a healthy and untrammelled development of her national life.  Abundantproof, however,  is now  afforded  to show that the  central European empires, taking advantage  of the chaotic and defenceless condition in which Russia  has  momentarilybeen placed,  are consolidating their hold on that  country,  and are steadily extendingtheir activities to the Russian far eastern possessions.     They have persistently interfered with  the passage of the  Czecho-Slovak troops through Siberia.  In the forces now opposing  these valiant troops German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners are freely enlisted, and  they practically assume the position of command.   The  Czecho-Slovak troops, aspiring  to secure  a free  and  independentexistence for their race, and loyally espousing the common cause  of the  allies, justlycommand every sympathy and consideration  from the  co-belligerents,  to  whom  theirdestiny is a matter of deep and abiding concern.     In the presence of the danger to which the Czecho-Slovak  troops  are  actuallyexposed in Siberia at the hands of the German and Austro-Hungarians, the allies havenaturally felt themselves unable to view with indifference the untoward course of events,and a certain number  of their troops have  already  been  ordered  to  proceed toVladivostok.     The  Government of the United States, equally sensible of the gravity of thesituation, recently approached the  Japanese  Government with  proposals  for the  earlydespatch of troops to relieve  the  pressure  weighing  upon the  Czecho-Slovak forces.The Japanese  Government, being  anxious to fall  in with fhe  desire of the AmericanGovernment, has decided to proceed at once to the disposition  of suitable forces for theproposed mission.   A  certain  number  of  these  troops will  be sent  forthwith toVladivostok.     In adopting this  course the Japanese Government remain in their constant desireto promote  relations of enduring friendship with Russia,  and  they reaffirm  their avowedpolicy of respecting the  territorial integrity of  Russia, and of  abstaining  from allinterference in her internal politics.  They further declare that upon  the realisation  ofthe objects above indicated they  will immediately withdraw all Japanese troops  fromthe Russian territories, and will leave wholly unimpaired the sovereignty of Russia in all its phases, whether political or military.     Two days later the following statement was issued by the Government of theUnited States : In the judgment of the-government of the United States-a judgment
 arrived at after repeated and very searching considerations of the whole  situation  military intervention in Russia would be more likely to add to the present sad confusion there  than to cure it, and would injure Russia rather than help her out of her distresses. Such  military intervention as has been most frequently proposed, even supposing it to be efficacious in its  immediate  object of delivering  an attack upon Germany from the east, would, in its judgment, be more likely to turn out to be merety a method of making use of Russia than to be a method of serving her.   Her people, if they profited by it at all, could not profit by  it in time to deliver them from  their present desperate difficulties, and their  substance would meantime be  used to maintain foreign armies, not to reconstitute their own or to feed their own men, women, and children.     We  are bending all our energies now to the purpose, the resolute and confident purpose, of winning on the western front, and it would in the judgment of the Govern- ment  of  the United States  be most unwise to divide or dissipate  our forces.  As  the Government of the United States sees the present circumstances, therefore military action is possible in Russia now only to return such  protection and help as  is  possible to the Czecho-Slovaks against the  armed Austrian and German prisoners who are attacking them, and to steady any efforts at self-government of self-defence in which the Russians themselves may be willing to accept assistance, whether from Vladivostok or from Murmansk and Archangel.     The  only present  object for which  American troops will be employed will be to guard military stores which may subsequently be  needed by Russian  forces  and to render such aid as may be acceptable to the  Russians  in the organisation of their own self-defence.   With such  objects in view the  Government of the United  States is now co-operating with the Governments of France and Great Britain in the  neighbourhood of Murmansk  and Archangel.   The United  States and Japan  are  the only  Powers which are just now in a position to act in Siberia  in sufficient force  to accomplish even such modest objects there as have been outlined.     The Government of the United States  has therefore proposed to the Government of Japan  that each of the two  Governments send a force of a few thousand  men to Vladivostok, with the purpose of co-operating as a single force  in the  occupation of Vladivostok  and  in safeguarding, so far  as it may,  the country to the rear of  the westward moving Czecho-Slovaks, and the Japanese Government has consented.     In taking this action the Government of the  United States wishes to announce to the people of Russia in the most public and  solemn  manner that  it  contemplates no interference  with  the  political sovereignty of Russia, no intervention in her internal. affairs, not even in the local  affairs of the limited areas which her  military force may be obliged to occupy, and no impairment of her territorial integrity,  either now or here- after, but that what we are about to clo has as its  single  and only object  the rendering of such aid as shall be acceptable to the Russian people  themselves  in their endeavour to regain  control of their own affairs, their own territory, and their own destiny.     The Japanese Government, it is understood, will issue a similar assurance.     These plans  and  purpose of the Government of  the  United States  have  been communicated  to  the  Governments  of Great Britain,  France, and Italy,  and those Governments have advised the  Department of State that they  assent to thein  in principle.   No conclusion that the Government of the United States has arrived at in this important  matter is intended,  however, as  an effort to  restrict  the actions  or interfere with  the independent judgment of  the  Governments with which we  are associated in the war.   &apos; It is also the hope and purpose of the Government  of the United States  to take advantage of the earliest  opportunity to  send to Siberia a commission  of  merchants, agricultural experts, labour  advisers, Red Cross  representatives, and agents of the Young  Meifs Christian  Association, accustomed  to organising the  best  methods  of spreading useful information and rendering educational help of a modest kind, in order in some systematic way to relieve the immediate necessities of the people there in everyway for which an opportunity may open.  The execution  of this plan  will follow and willnot be permitted to embarrass the military assistance rendered to the Czecho-Slovaks.     It is the hope and expectation of the Government of the United States that the Governments with which it  is associated  will, whenever necessary or possible, tender their active aid in the execution of these military and economic plans.     The Horvat Government. Sir C. Greene  telegraphed on the 1st August [No.  831] saying that M. Vostrotin, a  member of General Horvat&apos;s Ministry, who had come  to Tokio  to  dispel misapprehensions  as to the  generafs  aims,  Pad  paid  him a visit.Sir C.  Greene told him that it had been startling to  find  that, just at the moment-       [898-107]                                                         C
when the  allies were considering  how  they could help the Czechs  at  Vladivostok,General Horvat had assumed autocratic powers, and moreover had shown unwillingnessto co-operate with any other Russian political group, and.with it an apparent desire to forestall rivals.  He had hopes that the general would abandon the premature attemptto secure power, as he was glad to see that he had adopted a more reasonable attitude.In reply, M. Vostrotin spoke warmly of England, but  did not hold out much hope thatthe  general would either accept the  co-operation of any  other Russian element orabandon his pretensions.                                    GREECE.     Date  of joining in the War. Lord Granville  telegraphed on the 1st August[No. 700] that  the Minister for  Foreign Affairs  had informed  him that the  GreekGovernment  considered that  the  formal declaration of war against Germany and bulgaria, made by the Provisional Government at Salonica on the 23rd November, 1916,was morally effective from that date and actually effective for the whole of Greece fromthe  27th  June,  1917,  when  M. Venezelos  assumed  power at  Athens.   On  the28th July,  1917, a telegram had  been despatched  to the Greek Legations at Berlin,Vienna, Sofia, and Constantinople ordering them to leave immediately.                                  ABYSSINIA.     The Rumozvrs of  Lil  Yasus death [E.R. LXXIX, p. 3]. Sir II.  Wiugate tele-graphed on the 2nd August [No. 1169] that Mr. Thesiger  had replies to his enquiriessaying that he had. no confirmation of the  report; from time to time there had beensimilar rumours.                                  PALESTINE.     Economic  Situation.- General Clayton telegraphed  on  the  4th August [No. 29]that more shops were being epened daily at Jaffa, where trade was good;  at Jerusalem,too, the economic situation  was good ; and there was a  steady flow of people returning to Gaza.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     The Khurma Incident. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed  on the  31st July [No. 1155]that Colonel  Wilson had reported the  situation  in serious terms; the  failure  of the expedition would, he said,  gravely affect  King Hussein&apos;s prestige  and  prejudice theArab military operations in the north, for the attention of all  the  Arabs  in  Hejaz was directed to Khurma.     King Hussein. -On the 31st July Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No.  1156] that the message from  His Majesty&apos;s  Government had  been communicated to  King Hussein,who, in reply, had expressed his wish to abdicate, on the ground that  he felt he mightbe regarded as an obstruction of British policy and an obstacle to the  Arab movement.The King had confirmed this in a private letter  to Sir R. Wingate.  From conversations which Colonel Wilson (who had just returned from Jeddah) had had with the King, he gathered that the latter regarded the  future with gloomy  forebodings and  was in athoroughly  depressed state  of mind.  He felt  uncertain as  to our  real  policy  andsuspected us of partiality to  Ibn Saud, citing our  action with  regard  to  Khurma as evidence of this.  He believed his scheme of unification as the only satisfactory solutionof the Arabian question, and  would rather abdicate now than see the  collapse  of  his policy.     Sir  R.  Wingate thought  that he should be  taken  seriously, and a  reassuringmessage sent.   He submitted a draft  of  the  message he  proposed to send, and, withcertain modifications, this was approved  by Mr. Balfour.   The approved message ranas follows:      His Majesty&apos;s Government has seen, with great regret, that its message to your highness has been misunderstood, but realises that, amid the anxieties and preoccupa-tions which the great task  of Arab liberation imposes  on your Highness, suchmisunderstandings are  apt  to arise.  Its confidence  in  your Highness&apos; loyalty andsincerity has  been shown by  its constant and  unfailing  support during the last twoyears,  even  as  have your Highness&apos;  splendid  efforts  demonstrated your Highness&apos;confidence in it.   The message refeired to was delivered in your Highness&apos; own interests
and in  order to prevent a  public  calamity which would  discredit the whole  Arabmovement abroad, injure your Highness&apos; position, and gravely endanger the prospects of arab unity.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  notes  with satisfaction that your. Highnessexpressed a similar  opinion  to  Colonel Wilson and that  you realise the necessity of concentrating all your forces against the Turks.  It fully believes your assurances  madeto Colonel  Wilson that you have  no  intention of doing more than restoring order inKhurma.   At the same time your  Highness knows that there  are mischievous people who for their own ends  would be glad to  see trouble between your Highness and ibn saud, and that Turkish influence is probably behind them.  His  Majesty&apos;s government having Arab interests sincerely at heart feels itself bound most seriously to beg your highness to exercise patience while it  brings all possible means to bear upon Ibn Saudto induce him  to restrain his followers and confine his activities to  the north and east.His Majesty&apos;s  Government feels that having regard to  your great position in the eyes of the world  it would  be a gracious act for your Highness to send a  friendly  letterthrough  British  channels  to Ibn Saud, informing him  that  the expedition that your highness has sent to Khurma is not in any way an aggressive act against him, but hasbeen  necessitated by the  proximity  of Khurma to your capital,  and  proposing  animmediate  and friendly settlement.   His  majesty&apos;s Government is convinced thatmutual friendship and confidence can be restored by these means, and thus the prospectof Arab unity  be greatly advanced.  His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard seriouslya decision  to  abdicate  taken  by your Highness under a mistaken impression that your  Highness  had lost  the confidence of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   As stated above, far from this  being the case  His Majesty&apos;s Government regards your leadership of the Arab movement in the war as vitally necessary for the Arab cause and cannotthink that  your Highness  will  withdraw  at such a juncture.   Such  an act wouldimperil  the destiny  of millions  who  regard your  victory as  the guarantee of theirdeliverance, and would be a triumph for those intriguers who desire to see the Arabicpeople condemned to a  further period of Turkish servitude.  There are, God willing,many years of happiness and prosperity in store for your Highness in which to enjoy the fruits of your work.                                    PERSIA.     Vossugh-ed-Doioleh Prime  Minister. Sir C.  Marling  on the 2nd, 3rd,  4th, and 5th August sent a series of  telegrams [Nos.  670-674 and  681] giving an account ofevents which had led to the fall of the Cabinet and the appointment of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh as Prime Minister.   Without giving any warning, and on the ground  that theyhad, without exception,  been brought about  by fraud or  force, the Persian Governmentdenounced all concessions granted to Russians during the  last  hundred years and  alltreaties concluded with  Russia during the same  period.   As  a further justification ofits  action, the Government recalled  that the new Russian Government had  announced the abrogation of all these treaties and concessions, and  that the greater Powers hadproclaimed their  intention  to protect the  weaker nations ; adding  that the  treatiesthemselves had been either inoperative or wrongly  interpreted, and that the obligations in favour of Persia resulting from them had been disregarded.     It was  generally thought that this declaration was mainly intended as a show ofpatriotism by a moribund Cabinet;  but the Russian officer in command of the Cossackspointed out to the Shah, in person, that it was also a recognition of a regicide Govern-ment, and further that  the  Cabinet had repudiated the  agreement constituting theCossack brigade, and so had destroyed its  character.     The Shah told his ministers that  their  policy was  most  dangerous, and  dismissedthem by word of mouth.;  they  refused to  go unless they were dismissed in  writing.The crisis  was serious ; Samsan-es-Sultaneh telegraphed for  the  despatch  of  somehundreds of the Bakhtiari to Teheran.
