On  the  12th February M. Victor  Dufour, a  miningengineer attached to the Westinghouse Company in Petrograd,  who left that place onthe 12th January, was interviewed at the  Foreign Office.     M. Dufour confirmed what we have already had from various sources, that the vast majority of the -working men  are greatly discontented with the  existing regime andthat a very small minority are still favourably inclined towards the Bolsheviks.   what has caused this discontent among the working-men is the fact that  they are forced towork in the factories, are not allowed to hold any meetings during work hours, and areforbidden to change their work without authorization.   The Bolsheviks have attempted to introduce new  regulations such  as the change from  piece-work to day-work, but owing to agitation in the factories, they have been forced to give in  to the demands ofthe  men.  The men are very much  discontented, too, with the  commissars who are appointed by the Bolsheviks to control them.     All classes of the population think only of how they can get food ; politics have ceased to interest them, and in, case of intervention by the allies the Bolsheviks could notrely upon support from any class provided that allied intervention meant an improvementof food conditions.   The Bolsheviks have made  propaganda, chiefly for foreign  con-sumption, about the way the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries have acceptedtheir regime and have pronounced themselves  against allied intervention.   The state-ments of a few Mensheviks  and Social Revolutionaries quoted by the Bolsheviks havemade no impression whatever in Russia.  The only reason  that the Bolsheviks havemade so much of these statements is the hope that they will deceive opinion abroad and help to turn public opinion here against intervention.   There is no  real revolutionaryfeeling left amongst the workmen which could be utilised  by the Bolsheviks against theallies.  People feel  that  nothing could be worse  than the present conditions, amd are       [756]-228
only too  eager  for  any change.   They  are  not even  impressed by the  threats theBolsheviks hold over their heads that allied intervention would mean a revenge againstthe working classes.   It can be  said without hesitation that it would be quite impossibleto arouse  any national feeling  against  the foreigner  if the foreigner  came with the promise of food and  better conditions of life.     The  Bolsheviks themselves cannot remain  in  power indefinitely.  If there is nointervention they are bound to disappear in course of time, but there will be nothing totake their place.   Russia would simply be given  over to anarchy, and conditions wouldbecome even worse than they are at present.. There  would be  an entire  absence of central government,  and it is impossible to say what would  happen either politically oreconomically.   The prospect is  so  appalling that people look to intervention by theallies as the only way out of their present difficulties.UKRAINA.     The Directorate. Mr. Bagge, telegraphing on the  19th February  [No. 78],  saidthat any attempt to  reconstitute out of the moderate members of the directory  a  new government which should be capable of influencing the Dkrainan people, must inevitablyfail, because no government basing itself upon  the  idea  of an independent  Ukrainacould hope for the support of the masses, which decidedly were profoundly sympatheticwith tbe idea  of union with Russia.     Telegraphing again on the  same day, he reported that the Government had beenreconstituted from the moderate elements, though  nearly all of them  were in favourof an  independent  Ukraina.   M.  Petlura remained a  member  but M,  Vinichenkohad gone.                                            .THE OMSK  GOVERNMENT.    Appeal for Union  against  the  Bolsheviks. Sir Charles Eliot,  telegraphing fromYladivostock  on the 14th  February  [No. 218]  reported  that   an  appeal for unionagainst the Bolsheviks had been issued to all the democratic parties  by  the OmskGovernment.   The  grounds given  for the appeal were  the non-admission of universalsuffrage ;  the  decree depriving  the  educated  classes of their votes;  the standing  andplacing outside the law of ali classes but one which  claimed a dictatorship ;  the settingup  of  bureaucracy in  the place of municipal and village government, which had been abolished; and the replacing of the law courts by political  organisations.   Sir  CharlesEliot added that it might not be easy to obtain copies of the various Bolshevik decrees,but he believed the  statements contained in the appeal  to be true.                                     POLAND.     Recognition of  the Polish Government. Mr. Baifour, telegraphing  from Paris onthe 22nd February [No. 350] reported that a decision to recognise the  Polish Govern-&apos;ment had been  arrived at  on the  previous  day.  . Definite  instructions from theJapanese Government were  being awaited by its representatives;  but the Governmentof the United States had already recognised the  Government of Poland.     Desire of the Soviet Government  to  be on Friendly  Terms. Telegraphing fromWarsaw Sir Esme Howard reported on the 19th February [No 7] that he had beeninformed that the Soviet Government had intimated to that  of  Poland its anxiety toestablish friendly relations.   At the same time,  as a  proof of its good intentions,  itoffered to return the treasures of Polish art which had  been removed From  Warsaw bythe Imperial Government.     The Diet.  -Telegraphing on the 20th February [No. 8] Sir Esme Howard reported the meeting of the  diet that day.   The president, he said,&quot; had made a speech greetingthe inter-allied commission which was present. General Pilsudski afterwards placed his resignation in the hands of the  diet, and was  unanimously re-elected  chief of the state,provisionally,  pending the establishment  of a constitution, on condition that all  lawsmust be passed by the diet and then  signed by the  chief of the state and countersignedby a competent minister. M. Paderewski then gave an account of his acceptance of office,and of the work of the previous and  the present government, which was very well receivedby the large majority.   He asked for  immediate  general mobilization, which was unani-mously granted.  He  also spoke  in  favour  of  a large measure of land reform.   he paid an eloquent tribute to the action of the allied Powers in their liberation.
     Negotiations toiih Ukraina. On the loth February Sir  Esme Howard  reported[No. l] that, as the Ukrainan delegates had  declared themselves unable to accept  theproposed  line of demarcation, the armistice negotiations had  been broken off, and  theAnglo-French military mission had returned to Warsaw.   The inter-allied  commission,however, would endeavour to impose an armistice on both parties, and with that objectwere sending delegates to Lemberg -which was then being attacked in force by  theUkrainans.                                     TURKEY.     The  Demand  for the  Surrender of  Officials.- Admiral  Webb  reported on  the19th February  [No. 364] that he had received  a  reply  to his  letter demanding  the surrender of officials by the Turkish Government.   The contention of the Governmentwas that it  had been recognised  as a de facto and de jure  sovereign state by the fact ofan armistice having been  concluded  with, it, and that it incontestably possessed all  theprerogatives for freely exercising its sovereignty ; and international law recognised thata state had  the  right to try by its own tribunals such of its subjects as might commitcrimes or misdemeanours within its territory.   To comply,  then, with the demand whichhad been made  would be to act in direct contra-distinction with its sovereign rights.     Commercial Situation. On  the  24th February Admiral Webb reported [No. 424]as follows :      The  British  chamber  of commerce  of the Turkish - and  Balkan  states  held ameeting to-day  at my suggestion to consider the  commercial situation, and asked thatthe following resolution might be submitted to the prime minister.     I  fully endorse  this  resolution, and cannot  too  strongly urge  on  the primeminister the necessity for the resumption of normal commercial relations between theBritish Empire and. Turkey.  I  would  submit  that  very  sympathetic consideration should be shown by the Ministry of  Shipping towards the  release  of vessels requiredfor trade to Turkish and Black Sea ports.   The resolution  was as follows:      After an interruption of trade relations extending over a period of four years and several months, the British  chamber of commerce  of the Turkish and Balkan statesanxiously awaits a return to  normal conditions, which will enable British trade, shipping,finance, and insurance, to regain and  consolidate former predominant position of theUnited Kingdom in this country.     We thoroughly understand  that complete reconstruction of the edifice of trade andindustry is doubtless not altogether an easy matter  before the peace treaty is definitelysigned, but  it  is clear that  the settlement of many difficult  questions, including thoseof supplies,  exorbitant prices, finance, exchange, and affecting the restoration of credit,security, and  order, will be  facilitated by  unrestricted resumption  of trade relationsbetween Turkey and the United Kingdom, the only exceptional restrictions admissiblebeing those  which apply to such  foodstuffs  and essential raw materials as are requiredin the first place for the sole  use  of allied powers.     It  is necessary to facilitate at  once  the resumption of postal  and  telegraphiccommunications, and to permit  the  commercial community to come to  [? security  oftrade] without hindrance between Turkey and the United Kingdom.     Delay will deprive Great Britain of the opportunity of inheriting the trade and[? commerce] of the central powers which is now being shut down and liquidated, whichtrade is passing into  the  hands of  our  competitors, whose governments apparentlyseem more  ready and inclined  to remove  impediments  to trade  arising  from war-conditions.     The British chamber of commerce is [? convinced that I the  prime minister, whothoroughly understands to what  extent the prosperity of  United Kingdom and of theworking classes  depends on free and early development of  trade and industry, will take into serious  consideration  desiderata of this chamber of commerce.     Failure to appreciate and to find a remedy for the  present  critical situation will produce effects which will require much time, labour, and  money to efface.  immediate measures are therefore imperative, and the British  chamber of commerce begs that  hisexcellency the  British  high commissioner  will,  whilst forwarding  by  cable this resolution to the prime minister,  spare no efforts to  convince His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof the  necessity in the interests of the nation to give  complete satisfaction to the requests of British trade,  shipping, finance,  and insurance in this country by authorisingresumption  of normal commercial relations at the earliest opportunity-
                                     SYRIA.     The Municipal  Council  of Damascus. On  the 22nd  February  General Claytonreported [No. 49] the receipt of a telegram from the administrative council of the Syrianmunicipal council of Damascus  which had been despatched to the president of  the peaceconference, to Emir  Feisal, and to Mr. Wilson.   Among the  signatories were  represen-tatives of the administration, and of the religious  heads not only of the Moslems, butalso of the Greek Catholic and tbe Greek Orthodox Churches, and of the Jews.  Settingthemselves out as the legal representatives of the  people of Syria and its religious heads,they authorised the  Emir Feisal to act on their behalf in the presentation, to  the peacesconference, of their wishes and hopes for complete independence.     The  Syrian Lebamon Committee  in Cairo. On the 23rd February Lord Derbyreported  [No.  386] that the  &quot; Temps&quot; of that evening  had published  a  telegramaddressed to the central Syrian committee in Paris by the Syrian Lebanon committee atCairo, and signed among others by Abdallah Sfer, Farad  Babazogli Pasha, ShakourPasha,  Hakki  Bey,  &amp;c.   The  telegram  was to the effect that in the name of the numerous  adherents of the association in Egypt, who were  anxious at the pretensionsput forward by the representatives of  Flejaz, tbe committee,;in Cairo had requested thecentral Syrian  committee  to submit an energetic protest to the peace conference against those inadmissable pretensions.  The  committee had expressed its  firm  hope in the justice of the powers and its trust that the conference  would prevent the dismember-ment of Syria  and the establishment therein of conflicting influences, which would be a source of anarchy and  repression, and were  calculated to compromise  her economic andpolitical existence as well as  her  future.                                     ARABIA.     ibn  Saud. On the  17th  February Sir Milne  Cheetham reported [No.  252] thatthe chiefs of the Ateibah, a sub-tribe,  had written to King Hussein saying that, unless they were actively supported, they could not hold out much longer against the Akhwan,who had  seized their camels because  they would not  accept conversion the militaryproselytism of the Akhwan from Khurma had,  he said, been increased.  . ,             &apos;*&apos;     King Hussein had stated that Wahabi missionaries  had  gone into the Asir country,and he feared  the defection  of his household  Bishah troops -and of others of his bestlevies ; he feared, too, the defection of the whole of the Ateibah sub-tribe, and had inconsequence returned to Mecca.  He had declared that  if Ibn Saud wrere not forced to recall Ibn Bijad, to  stop  the  Akhwan  aggression&apos;,  and to  evacuate Khurma, he mustabdicate.  Colonel Wilson believed  his intention to  do so to be serious.   .  Telegraphing again on the 20th February, Sir Milne Cheetham reported. [No. 277]the arrival of Colonel Wilson in  Cairo.  Fie, Colonel Wilson, was  of opinion,  that king hussein would either abdicate&apos; at once or attack Khurma if we did not compel Ibn Saudto  abandon that place.     Should the King attack. Khurma his success was very doubtful, in spite of the factthat influenza  had scattered the Akhwan.   If, on the  other hand, he should abdicate,there was a certainty of  serious and  perhaps prolonged trouble, and a probability thatthe next pilgrimage would be prevented.  The succession of Emir Ali  was not assured.     Ibn Saud, on his part, wrote to the political agent at Baghdad, who reported onthe 14th February that he  had received a summary of this letter from the politicalagent at Bahrein, to whom it  had been sent, to be forwarded to Baghdad.  The object of the letter was  to ascertain  the policy of the British Government.   The writer saidthat he had received information that the Hejaz troops were  being  mobilised for thepurpose of attacking him.   He hoped that the information  was incorrect, but to avoidfuture misunderstandings he brought it to the  notice of tbe British, authorities.      From  the information  he  had  received, it appeared to the agent  at Bahrein, that mobilization of his forces  was contemplated  by  Ibn Saud,  but  that he would await a reply to his  letter before doing so.      On the 26th  February [No. 273] the Foreign  Office informed Sir Milne  Cheetham that a  message  would  be  sent  to  Ibn  Saud informing  him  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government w-as  concerned  at reports  it had  received of impending hostilities between twodeading Arab chieftains who enjoyed its  friendship.   His Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared,  as it always had  been,  to adjudicate  between them by appointing, after the war, a commission to set out. their frontiers;  an  offer which it understood had, so far, not been accepted by the King  of Hejaz, though Ibn Saud had  expressed his wdllingness to  do  so.  Subject to the conditions that both parties would keep the peace pending arbitration, and  would agree  to accept the  decision  of the commission as final,
the offer was still open ; and that being so it could  not be believed that the disputan twould persist in their  present intentions.  Should  they do so the responsibility wouldbe their own, and it was desirable  for them to clearly  understand  what our attitude would be.   ibn  Saud could, in no circumstances be  permitted to  advance westward ofthe area in dispute into what was  beyond doubt Hejaz  territory;  should he do so weshould  be  prepared to give the King of Hejaz every  assistance in our power short of providing him with  troops.   If, however,  the  fighting were  confined  to  the area in dispute we should not interfere.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    Attitude towards Great Britain. The political  agent at Baghdad reported on the14th February  that he understood that a letter had been despatched to King Husseinasking him to represent to the peace conference that in the recent declarations in regardto the future government of the country  public  opinion was not granted freedom of expression.  He understood also that King Hussein  had been  asked  to request thepeace  conference that other  powers  should  send  representatives  to  report on thesituation.                                     PERSIA.    Situation  in   the  Urumia District.-On  the  23rd . February  Sir  Percy  Coxtelegraphed [No. 144]  the following  summary of  a joint  message from the consular representatives :     The governor  of Urumia has  no authority and no police.   The Persian Moslemsare armed and  the  Kurds  not  only hold the district,  but are in relations with theTurks.  The hatred between  Christians and  Moslems  still continues.   Trouble, and perhaps, massacres,  will recommence if the Christian refugees return without a foreignforce  to protect them.  The acting-governor at [?  Tabriz], however  willing he  may be,is  powerless to  cope with  the  situation aggravated as  it is by the intrigues of thesoi-disant Turkish and  German  consuls and the  presence of disturbing elements fromthe Caucasus.   The prestige conferred by the  victory  of the allies is  high and themoment is favourable.for the restoration of order, but for this purpose  a small force ofallied troops is absolutely indispensible, and  would  be welcomed most  sympatheticallyby the best elements of the population.                                AFGHANISTAN.    Murder of the Amir. On  the  23rd February the  viceroy  of  India  transmittedtelegrams from the  British agent at Kabul reporting the  murder of the Amir HabibullaKhan on the 20th February.    On the following   day he  transmitted  a  message  from Sir George Roos-Keppelreporting the current story of the Amirs death.  According to this he was  sleeping inhis tent at  Laghman,  where, without interference,  early in the morning of the 20thFebruary, he was murdered.  When the news reached Jalalabad,  Nasrulla (brother)and Inayatulla  (son) went to the scene of the tragedy and brought back the body withthem.   After the funeral  Nasrulla  was saluted as Amir by those  present, and it isbelieved that Inayatulla acquiesced ; but some prominent men, who were not present at the funeral,  had already fled  to  Kabul with  the  purpose, it was  believed,  of inducing a younger son of the  late ruler to proclaim either  himself or  Inayatulla hisfa,ther&apos;s successor.    On the 25th February Sir  George Roos-Keppel telegraphed  again  to the viceroysaying that  except  in  small details the information contained in his previous message had  been confirmed by travellers who had  left  Jalalabad on  the 22nd  February.It was  said that the Amir was murdered  by his personal attendants.  At the funeralInayatulla refused to be Amir,  after  Nasrulla had offered to proclaim him, and asked the latter to take the  throne.   The Afghan mullahs and those  of  the  frontier tribesare said to be  rejoicing at the  death  of Habibulla  and  the  accession of Nasrulla.At Jalalabad in the Friday prayers the khutba was read in NasruhVs name.  It  isopenly said by the Afghans that he arranged the murder of Habibulla,  and that hehad the consent of Inayatulla.    Telegraphing on the 24th February the Viceroy said that he had to-day receiveda letter from Nasrulla-ul-Mulk  himself.  He set out the facts very much as they havebeen given  above.   He added  that  he hoped  that, by the efforts of  both  parties,the friendship and friendly intercourse between Great Britain and Afghanistan wouldbe daily increased.
