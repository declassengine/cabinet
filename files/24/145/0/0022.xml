SECRET.88APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXXII.                                     BULGARIA.      SIR  HORACE RUMBOLD&apos;S  telegram  No. 318 is interesting.   However, it  is advisable  that we should not build too  high hopes on  M. Malinoff, who may prove to be only camouflage put up by King Ferdinand  to serve  a  turn.  If and when King- Ferdinand is removed we should have real reason to hope that a  Balkan settlement  is in sight, leading eventually to a  Balkan Union.  Of course the  Bulgarian people  can never be content with the Treaty of Bucharest, or with the placing of the Bulgarophil population  of Macedonia under Serbian or  Jugo-Slav rule,  any  more than they can  cease  desiring to  extend their territory to  the   Enos-Midia  line  at  Turkey&apos;sj expense.      It is interesting to  observe in this morning&apos;s &quot; Times&quot;  a report of a manifesto  by Miss  Christobel Pankhurst. on behalf of the  Women&apos;s  Party, which repeats  at thisI juncture the old nonsense about  the -&apos; Prussia of the Balkans,&quot; and  the  necessity of maintaining the terms of  the Treaty of Bucharest.  Are  we to have  a  fourth  Balkan war after this one is over?                                      ARABIA.      A telegram has been  received by the War Office from General Allenby (not given in the report) giving strong support  to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in favour of reducing the number of arms to be given to  lbn Saud to a minimum, and deprecating any  attempt to encourage Ibn  Saud to  attack Hail.   He  points out that any  further- trouble on the Hejaz-Nejd frontier can only result in the diversion of  Sherif  Feisafs forces and attention from his present objectives to  a  useless quarrel in Central Arabia.      It  is further  evident  that Ibn Saud&apos;s  akhwan   (Wahabi  schools) are being encouraged by the Turks and by their agents with a view to using the Wahabi&apos;s move- ment to embarass or even overthrow King Hussein and the real Arab movement.                                     TURKEY.      The telegrams  about  the character and action of the new Sultan  are very remark- able  if true.   It is not very like the C.U.P. to misjudge their man so completely. &apos; NotI even &quot; great  popularity&quot; is quite enough  support for a Sultan in  Constantinople, and certainly not enough to enable him to override the wishes of the murderer of  Nazim Pasha, who imagines himself to be the reincarnation  of Napoleon,  and  who  has Ge germany behind him.                                      PERSIA.      Sir Percy Cox  is now on his way to  Teheran, to act as  British representative in the absence of Sir  Charles  Marling, who has secured the appointment of a Persian Prime Minister, Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, who is well  disposed  towards the British.  Our aim  now is to keep the present  Persian Government in power, and to resist Turkish military and German political penetration into Persia to the utmost of our power.

RUSSIA.     Manifesto of Allied Diplomatists. The allied diplomatists in Archangel issued an address to the Russian people in which, after explaining their  departure from Vologda,their arrival at Archangel, and their subsequent movements, they went on to say :      It was  never our  intention or desire to  quit Russia, and we have not done  so.  Onour return, to&apos;Archangel we find  the city and the surrounding country  under the  new government, which has already explained to you its organisation and  its plans for thefuture.   While considering you as allies against a common enemy of  the governments and  the peoples whom we represent, we have no intention of interfering in your internal affairs.   We hold to the belief that all civilised peoples  have the  right themselves todetermine their  own  form  of   government.   We  have never recognised the Brest-Litovsk peace,  and so  stated to you when it was signed, and again when it was ratified by the Soviet congress at Moscow on the 17th  March.   That position  has ....   we will  never recommend to our Governments the  recognition of any Russian  Governmentwhich has not a national character, which disregards Russia&apos;s solemn bonds  of alliance,and  which observes the Brest-Litovsk jneace treaty.     We feel confident that  the  allied countries we&quot; represent could  make  their  ownpeace terms with Germany at any time, if  they would agree  to leave Russia to thetender mercies of the central empires.     Such a peace, however, if accepted, would only be temporary, as Germany, afterstrengthening  herself with the  immeasurable resources and immense man-power ofRussia, prompted by  her  insatiable ambition  to rule the world, would threaten theliberties of the peoples whose trust we  hold.   Moreover, we  not  only sympathise withRussia in the difficulties she has encountered, but we feel deeply grateful to her for herheroic struggle, the sacrifices she made, and the  timely assistance  she  gave  the allied
cause in the beginning of this world; struggle.  If you have any doubt in your  ownminds and hearts concerning the dominating spirit of grasping selfishness in Germany,.you need  only read the expressions of her rulers, of her  military party, of her political leaders, of her clergy, or even  of her Socialists, to dispel any such doubt.   The Germansprofess to believe that they  are God&apos;s  chosen  agents, not  only  for the  subjugation ofRussia, but for all the peoples  of the entire world.   When  Germany brought on  thisworld-war, her people were  so imbued with their potentialities for success that theyassumed a hauty and overbearing attitude toward all opponents.   Within a few monthsa Minister of Foreign Affairs, who dared question the  strength of Germany to  settlethis conquest by force of arms, was compelled to resign.    Surely  you  will not accept a  peace which has already dismembered your greatcountry,   in whose record  and  achievement every  Russian with any  national  spiritcherishes  a pardonable pride.  Indifference or lukewarmness, or inaction on your part atthis tune will result  in additional  and  still greater cutailments  of your liberties, still greater  encroachment  on  your territories by the central empires, and will bring downupon  your memories the anathemas of  your descendants.    The defence of their country is, nevertheless, a question between every Russian andhis own  conscience.   The  allies  leave it  there with  every confidence, and  have no intention  of forcing any one to fight against their will.    There can be no doubt  about the outcome of this war.  It will  result  in the absolutedefeat of  the  central empires.  The German dream of world power will be dissipated,and even  the  Germans themselves will look back with humiliation upon the time whenthey  indulged in such vanity and folly.  This allied victory will result in a lasting peace.There will no longer  be  any question as to a  civilised people  being dominated by aforeign Power.  The right of all people to dispose of themselves is  the main  issue  of thisstruggle, and  it  will be settled, and  settled right, before the allied armies will lay down their  arms.  Russia has a great  future, and the Governments and  the people whom werepresent  will  not permit that future to be clouded or impaired by  German presumption.    We expect  to remain in Russia and to continue to represent the friendly sentimentof our countries towards you.  Our Governments will recognise any form  of  governmentyou may adopt, provided it  is the choice of the entire people,  and provided, furthermore,that it will offer  resistance to  our enemy, who is also your enemy, and the enemy of allliberty-loving  people  throughout  the world.  Russia has within her borders more thansufficient  products to  feed  and clothe her immense  population, but  if,  attributable to civil strife or ineffective transportation, you  are deprived of the necessities of life, we are willing and ready to divide our own products with you; the knowledge that you  are suffering  from hunger or  nakedness would prevent our enjoyment of the  materialblessings of an all wise Providence.    The  New Government  of Northern Russia [E.R.   LXXXI,  p.  5J. Mr.  Lindleytelegraphed on the 11th August [No. 68] saying that though M. Tchaikovsky&apos;s colleagues were  hardly up  to his own standard yet they  had an undoubted following among thepeasantry whom they had been most successful in gaining over :  they were too membersof the constituent assembly.    As to M.  Tchaikovsky  himself,  Mr. Lindley had found his  views absolutely  soundin regard  both to the alliance and the war.  Though he was  a republican, he was quite ready to  bow to a general desire, should there  be one, for  the restoration of the monarchy : but  he agreed with General Denikin that it would be  fatal at this period toraise  the question.  His  character was  beyond, reproach for honesty, and it would bedifficult to find any one more  fitted  to be head of the Government in spite of his age and of the fact that he was  unused to the exercise of authority.     The  Allied   Consuls in Moscow. On the  14th  August Sir  Esme  Howard trans-mitted [No. 2284] a telegram  which, at the request of the allied consuls in Moscow, hadbeen  sent to the Swedish Foreign Office by its consul-general  at that  place.   It was addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Paris with a request that it should becommunicated to all the allied  Governments.   To-day the Soviet Government  hasremoved the seals placed upon the  consulate-general and has released  my secretarieswho  were detained.   M. Tchitcherin has  given a written  undertaking to assure the departure of the consulate and of the personnel of the  military attache  on condition oflearning through the medium  of the Swedish consul-general that the French Governmentwill not oppose the return of Russian soldiers in France and will  accept the help of theinternational  Red  Cross  to repatriate them according to the means at their [? group undecypherable] disposal.  Please send urgent  telegram in this sense to the consulate-
general of Sweden.   On arrival  of  this telegram and of German safe conducts I shallleave Moscow for Stockholm with General Lavergne and all allied consuls and missions.     Murmansk. On  the   15th  August  Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed  [No.  1209]  toMr. Erskine, at Borne, informing him that the agreement made by General Poole withthe Murman regional council had  been formally approved.  The terms of this agreement were published in the press ; the chief  of them provided  for  co-operation between  theallied forces and the council, and  the furnishing  of economic  assistance  to  the native population.     Bolshevists and Germans. Mr.  Balfour telegraphing to Mr. Barclay at Washington on the 20th August [No. 5132], said that the  French Government  had been  informed by its consul-general at Moscow that the  Germans  had concluded an  agreement withthe Bolshevists : Germany undertook to take payment of the six milliard roubles due toher in commodities,  to make  a  loan  of a  milliard,  and to  assist the  Bolshevists inregaining the Don country.  The Bolshevists  undertook to co-operate with Germanyagainst the allies, and to  furnish her  with produce  from the  Don  country and  theUkraine.   Germany, it was further agreed, should  have a free hand against us  inthe Caucasus ; but, in return  for  a large supply of oil,  should leave Baku  to  the bolshevists.THE CAUCASUS.     New Republic of North Caucasus. On the -15th  August the Russian Governmentsent out  the following wireless message, which bore the name of the president of thecentral executive committee of the  North Caucasian Councils Republic:  We  herebybring to the  knowledge of  all that  the congress of north  Caucasian  councils  inIskaterinodar, on the 7th July, formed a North Caucasian  Councils  Republic, which includes  the province of Stavropol, the Black  Sea province, and the regions of Kubanand Ter, and is a part of the  federation  of the  Russian Socialist Councils Republic.The supreme authority of the republic is invested in  the central executive committeeof the people&apos;s delegates.   Its  capital is the city of Iskaterinodar.SIBERIA.     The  Czechs and  General  Semenoff. Sir  Conyngham  Greene  telegraphed frontTokyo on the 15th  August  [No.  887]  that the  Czechs  had  revised  their opinion ofGeneral Semenoff, against whom they had been strongly prejudiced, regarding  him as  an  adventurer  pure  and  simple,  and  one  with   reactionary  views.  At   a personal   interview  the  general officer  in command of the Czech  troops had been so  favourably  impressed  that  he  was  prepared  to  accept  General  Semenoffsco-operation.     Poles in Siberia. On the  1st August  Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 7] to Mr.  Slyat Harbin asking whether there were many Polish colonists in Siberia ; whether therewere many Poles among the prisoners of war ; and whether there was  any  organisationby which we could get into touch with them for the  purpose of securing  them formilitary  service with the allies.   Mr. Balfour added that according  to  reports receivedthe Czech forces had been joined by a good many Poles.     Replying on the 13th August [No. 3] Mr. Sly said that so far as he had been ableto ascertain this report seemed  to be incorrect, no great numbers having joined.   As tothe other matters the first two questions must be answered affirmatively.  There was tooa Polish  committee at Harbin which might possibly become useful in the way suggestedif the Poles were assured that they would receive full allied support, both material andmilitary, and that  they would fight with  the  allies for the allied aims, including  theindependence of. Poland.TURKESTAN.     Cossack Garrisons replaced by Austrians. Sir John Jordan telegraphed from Pekinon the 15th August [No. 685] that 100 Austrian prisoners of war had been ordered by theBolshevik Government to replace the Cossack  outposts at Tashkurgan ; ibut  orders pro-prohibiting their entry had been issued by the  Taoyin of Kashgar.   The Russian minister was his informant.   Telegraphing again  on the following day [No. 692], Sir John Jordan       [898-109]                 &quot;                                     B 2
said that the information in regard to these Austrians had been confirmed by the consul-general at Kashgar.   The consul-general added that the Cossacks in Sarikol were alsoto be relieved by Austrians.     Meetings  between the New Siberian Government and General Horvat. Mr. Hodgsontelegraphed on  the  17th August [No. 69] that during  the  past days  there had  beendaily meetings between the two parties, but the discussions appear to have been futile,being  confined  to  the respective claims of  legally  elected  bodies to representation.General Horvat  claimed to be the  only legal representative of the  late  provisionalGovernment  who had retained his post, and that only men who had had administrativeexperience were  in his Government which included representatives of all parties.  The con-tention of the Siberian Government, on the other hand, was that the Horvat Governmenthad not been elected by any one whilst its own members had been elected by all except the  propertied classes.   The bone of  contention was the figurehead, for both  parties were willing to take in members of each other&apos;s Governments.                                   BULGARIA.     Increasing dislike of Germans and Turks. Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed  fromBerne on the 7th Augnst [No. 318 received the  14th August]  that the military attachesdepartment  had  learnt that the hatred  of Germans and Turks was  becoming moreaccentuated in  Bulgaria  where German  employees  were  being  dismissed  by theMalinoff cabinet  and Bulgarian employees  ill treated by the peasanty as suspected ofrequisitioning on behalf of Germans.     The Malinoff Government had informed the peasantry  that all merchandise was for the use of the country;  that the  Government would not  act as a  German agent;that Bulgaria  would never satisfy the Turkish claims ; and that  the  Government  was prepared to conclude,  if necessary, peace with honour.     Meetings of soldiers on leave, deserters, &amp;c, were being  held all over the country with the countenance  of the Government, demanding  impeachment  of  the late cabinet and recording that the allies had no  interest to serve in working against Bulgaria.These meetings were  often  accompanied by anti-Turkish : iots.   The King was calledupon to terminate the  war, failing which the  people would be forced to decide the fate of the country for themselves.   It was owing to these events that the King had  been advised to absent himself for a while.  The calling up of the 1920  class had added tothe discontent.                                   TURKEY.     Enver Pasha [E.R. LXXXI,  p.   3]. -Sir Horace  Rumbold telegraphed on the18th  August  [No.  1408] that he had been  informed  that,  according to a  Turkishdiplomat who was recently  in Constantinople, Enver  Pasha had lost favour both  withSultan and people, and had been reduced to the position  of  chief of the general staff.No important military decisions were made without the consent of the Sultan who had assumed the position of generalissimo of the army and was virtually minister of war.     The Sultan  and the C.U.P. In another telegram sent  on the same day [No. 1409]Sir Horace Rumbold said that the military attached department had  learnt  that the sultan had filled all vacancies in palace offices  himself,  rejecting the nominees of theCommittee of Union  and Progress.   The  military attached  informant said  that thecommittee wmuld not have allowed the Sultan to mount  the throne if they had realizedwhat sort  of man he was; now  they could do nothing  on  account  of his greatpopularity.     Exchange of Prisoners of War. On the  14th August Mr. Balfour sent thefollowing telegram [No. 1950] to Sir Walter  Townley for transmission to  Constanti-nople: As  a sequel to the  agreement recently  signed by  the British  and german delegates at The Hague, His Majesty&apos;s Government desires to  propose  to the TurkishGovernment the exchange of all British prisoners of war  who have been or may come tohave been eighteen months in captivity for equal numbers and ranks of Turkish prisonersof war who have been in British captivity for a similar period.     It  would also propose  that  the  reciprocal  repatriation  of British  and  Turkishcivilians, as stipulated in the  Berne agreement, should be  without the exception  ofthose of military age.
     It would suggest, in order to eliminate as far as possible  the  occasion of futuredisagreement, that the condition of non-employment stipulated in the Berne agreement should be abolished in the case of all prisoners repatriated either under that agreementor under the one now proposed.     It proposes that the repatriation of all the above should  take place by the samemeans as stipulated by the Berne agreement.     Please enquire whether the Turkish Government agrees to the above proposals and press for earliest possible reply.TURKESTAN.     Flight of the Jelus. On the 16th August Sir Charles Marling transmitted [No. 707] a telegram from the vice-consul at Hamadan reporting the arrival at that place ofJelus flying from the  Turks.   About 2,000 women and children,  or men who were sick and wounded, had already  arrived and another 6,000  were on  their W&amp;Y.  The militaryauthorities were arranging  quarters for them.   They Avere starving  and destitute, andthe vice-consul said that he was to be a member of the relief committee which wouldbe formed.     Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 709],  Sir  Chaides Marling  said that itwas estimated at Bijar that there would be some 80,000 of  these  Assyrian refugees40,000 of whom had already passed through that place en route for  Hamadan.   Manyhad died on the road  of sickness and starvation and some parties  had  been robbed ofeverything.  The vice-consul  at Hamadan said  that the amount required for reliefwould be considerable.                                  PALESTINE.     Deportation  of   Germans. General  Clayton telegraphed  on  the 18th  August[No. 42] that the deportation of Germans from Jerusalem had  been completed.                                     ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Congratulations from  King  Hussein. Sir Reginald Wingate  telegraphed on the16th August [No.  1223] that  cordial congratidations on the recent successes  on  thewestern front had been sent to  the King and the British Government by King Hussein.On the 19th August Mr.  Balfour instructed [No. 1020] Sir Reginald  Wingate to conveysuitable thanks to King Hussein.NEJD.     Ibn Saud and King Hussein. Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Sir R.  Wingate onthe 16th August [No. 1013] that  Mr.  Philby was being instructed  to grant funds  andarms to Ibn Saud (the arms being  restricted to a minimum  supply),  and to address a communication to him as suggested by Sir Reginald Wingate.                                     PERSIA.     Sir Percy Cox. On the 18th  August Mr. Balfour  telegraphed [No.  431] to sir charles Marling informing  him that Sir Percy Cox had agreed to replace him during his absence from Teheran.   Mr. Balfour added that  he thought  Sir Percy Cox should bestyled Acting Minister and have the local rank of minister plenipotentiary.     The Jangalis. Sir  Charles  Marling telegraphed on the 15th August [No. 704]that the Jangalis had  signed an agreement with General DunsterviLVs representative.     The Bakhtiari.-On the 27th July the political officer at Baghdad sent a telegram in which  he  made certain proposals in regard  to the Bakhtiari.  He began by referring to the recent successful expedition  of the Ilkhani against the Kuhgilu tribes,  due to assistance given by us,  in consequence  of which he  said that not only  the   Ilkhanihimself, but also the Illbegi were  elated and ready to  co-operate  with us to  any extent.[E.R. LXXIX, p. 4.]     The political agent proposed that Sirdar Zafar, the Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari, shouldnot only be given an assurance of our continued support,  but also be  invited to maintain a force of 1,500 picked men, of whom  1,000  should be  mounted, and be  immediately
under his own command.   The objects of such a force would be  to maintain the Ilkani&apos;authority  in  Bakhtiaristan, and to stabilise  the situation in  Ispahan.   For the  main-tenance of the force we should be  prepared to pay from  8,000 to  10,000 tomansa month.                                                                         ^     These proposals were concurred in by the commander-in-chief and  supportealrjr -&apos;the Indian Government, but Sir Charles Marling telegraphed on the 30th July [No.:.66^f],,,saying that he had considerable misgivings in regard to them.   He  thought that if!carried into effect the jealousy of the other khans would be aroused, what  was proposedbeing, in  effect, an agreement made &quot;with  Zafar  personally to keep  him in office inreturn for his keeping up a body of  troops  to be  used in  our  interests.  He would.probably be ejected from his office by the other khans.  The  proposals were calculated to bring about a split  in  the  tribe, and in his opinion the two khans acting withZafar did  not possess either the requisite standing or the requisite influence to enable him to carry  out the proposed arrangement.     But on the 14th August Mr. Balfour  telegraphed to Sir Charles Marling [No. 421]saying that as in all the circumstances the  probable advantages would outweigh  thepossible risk  indicated  by the latter, it  had been  decided to  adopt the  Baghdadproposals.  As to the  best means  of carrying them out, Mr. Balfour requested  sir charles Marling to instruct the consul  at Ahwaz to consult with Dr. Young.     On the 17th August Sir Charles Marling telegraphed [No. 710] that  the  khans in(? Teheran) had  enquired  whether we intended to maintain Zafar, whom  they assertedhad never been formally recognised as  Ilkhani; they were told that Zafar had shownhimself friendly to us, and  we naturally supported our friends.  Samsan-es-Sultanehtalked of going down to (? Bakhtiaristan)  and taking charge of the tribe as senior khan.     Germany and  the Abrogation  of  Treaties. Sir  Charles  Marling  telegraphedon  the  17th  August [No. 712] that the Persian Government had been informed  bythat of Germany that  the abrogation  of  treaties imposed by force in Persia,  violatingher independence, was recognised.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.    Political Parties. Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to  Mr. Lindiey on the  21st  August[No.  33] a report  on the  Russian political  parties  which  he  had received from.M. Meierowitz, the representative of the Lettish National Council.   M. Meierowitz saidthat  MM. Savinkoif and  Avksentieff  had  greater influence than any other of the republican leaders, but in his opinion  MM. Tchaikowsky  and Kishkiu were  of even greater  importance.  The  former, though an old man was, he  considered, a leader ofincreasing influence.  The Octobrists and Cadets, the parties, that is,  of  the Right,were split into two groups, one pro-ally,  partly monarchical and partly republican, theother pro-German and monarchical.  It should not, he said, be difficult to work  up a genuine anti-German feeling, and intervention would be strongly supported.    Proposed  Lettish and Esthonian Legions. Mr.  Lindiey telegraphed  on the  13thAugust [No. 72] that a Lettish legion  was being  formed  at Archangel, with Lettishofficers  and word of command  and British  discipline,  with the object of turning theGermans  out  of  Lettland.   A  certain  number of Letts had been recruited  andMr.  Lindiey  was  confident that more would come if they knew  the  conditions andobjects of service.  He added that it was proposed to do the same for the Esthonians.o
