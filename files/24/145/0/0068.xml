Colonel Robertson  reported  on the  26thJune [No.  568, received 2nd July], that Admiral Kolchak&apos;s chief of staff had telegraphedto General Horvat proposing General Semenoff as successor to General Ivanoff Rinoff,on the ground that he should be put in charge of all operations against the Bolsheviks,as he was in command of the largest body of Russian troops in the Far East.   GeneralHorvat, who attributed the proposal to General Ivanoff Rinoff, had sent a  direct replyto the admiral refusing to agree.   Colonel  Robertson  added that  an extremely  bad effect would be produced in Viadivostock by  the proposed appointment.     Causes  of Local  Trouble  in  Eastern   Siberia. Telegraphing on the  1st  July[No. 579] from Vladivostock, Colonel Robertson said that he had received the report ofa small deputation of delegates, Russian and allied, which  had  accompanied an expe-dition  to Olga Bay at tbe request of the  allied representatives  in Vladivostock.   Thecause of tbe local trouble  was said by the representatives of the workmen and peasantsto be the oppressive and reactionary measures of the Omsk government.     Those  representatives  had expressed a desire for  a form  of government whichshould be in correspondence with popular wishes, but at the same time they had denied that they were Bolsheviks.   They maintained that repressive measures, such as  news-paper  censorship, transfer of the  militia to new central  authorities in place of thezemstvos, interference with elections to the latter bodies, and arrest of their officials when their opinions were too democratic, had followed the liberal declarations and promises of admiral Kolchak.  Formerly they had  had confidence in the militia, but since itstransfer to the new authorities, bribes were  taken and  the  peasants were  oppressedafter the manner of the police of the old regime.     They  maintained, too, that the allies, who had intervened to  restore order,  had actually produced disorder; for  which reason they asked for the withdrawal  of  their forces.     Colonel Robertson added that, unless the restoration of order  in Siberia was to betreated merely as a  military problem, these  opinions could not  be ignored, though ofcourse there was nothing new in them.80    General Horvat and General Semenoff.

    Lettish Representative in Siberia. On the 8th July Lord Curzon informed [No. 455]the high  commissioner that  Mr.  J.  Maspol, of  Vladivostock,  had  been appointedLettish representative in  Siberia, by the provisional government of Latvia.  He hadbeen instructed to enter into relations with the diplomatic representatives of the allied and  associated  powers  and  with  the  Russian  authorities  in  Siberia;  to  concernhimself with  ameliorating  the  lot of Lettish  refugees,  and  to  arrange   theirrepatriation ; also to obtain assistance for the mobilisation and formation of the Lettishnational army.  As his majesty&apos;s government  had recognised the  Lettish provisionalgovernment as a  de  facto government  there was no  objection  to Sir Charles  Eliotentering into communication with Mr. Maspol.    The Exchange of Prisoners with  the  Soviet Government. The following  wireless message was  sent from Tsarkeio Selo :     Replying to  your radio of the 29th June, completed on the 1st July, we have toinform you that, General Ironside having  rejected our  proposal regarding a generalexchange  of  all British military men  taken prisoners  by  Soviet troops,  excludingofficers, against all Russian Red militarv men in the hands of the British command  onthe north of Russia,  those negotiations were  broken off.  It is  quite obvious  that negotiations by way of exchange of radiograms  cannot lead to  any satisfactory  result,more especially when such an intricate question  is involved as a general  exchange of all prisoners  of  war and civilians, inclusive  of Russians forcibly enlisted in the british army  and scattered all over  the British  colonies and   dominions.   The civil war inRussia sustained and prolonged by the allied governments and the incessant discoveriesof plots hatched by  Russian  and  foreign  agents of these  governments compel theSoviet authorities carefully to discriminate between Russian citizens wishing to  return home  for honest and harmless purposes and those who may have put themselves at thedisposal of our enemies for carrying out their  sinister  counter-revolutionary  designs.This would necessitate a watchful control of the repatriation  of Russians, which couldnot be  done  by wireless but only by  representatives loyal to the Soviet government,enjoying its full confidence, and empowered to take decisions on their own initiative and responsibility on unforeseen questions  which might arise during the negotiations.   Youwill understand that  this task cannot possibly be entrusted to any  neutral citizen, still less to persons representing privileged classes whom the British government may deemto be of high  standing.....Notwithstanding  the counter-revolutionary activitiesof  many  foreigners   in Russia  the  Soviet authorities  allowed  Colonel  Parker and miss  Adams  to  carry on their humanitarian  work of giving  help  to their fellow-countrymen  without  ascertaining  whether they  supported  their government andits  policy  or  not,  and  we should think  that  the British  government  too mighttrust  our  representatives not  to  deviate  from  the  special tasks of  their mission.Anticipating, however, the objections  of the  British government to our representativesgoing to England, we proposed  alternatively to enable  them to go to some  neutral country.  We  feel sure that  the neutral countries which  have broken off  relationswith Russia  only under pressure of the  Entente will raise no objection to this proposalif it is accepted by the British government.   It might also help to  settle the questionof repatriating neutral subjects from Russia.  The  Soviet  government regrets  to  be unable to make or accept any other  proposals on the subject.TURKESTAN.    Moslem  Propaganda. On the  3rd  July the viceroy telegraphed [No. 8963] thatGeneral Mallesohs agent had reported from Samarkand, on the 16th  June, that agitatorswere still busy proclaiming that  the time had  come for all true believers to rise anddefend their  faith with Bolshevik help, and  to prevent the holy places from falling intothe hands of the  infidel,  urging  too the need of preventing  the Entente powers fromsuppressing Islam.  The  agitators  were Indians and Turks, assisted by some germans and Austrians ; the Shaykh ul-Islam did not sympathize  with them.    As the Afghan agitators received no support from the amir of Bokhara, they wereremoving from that place to Tashkent.                                     TURKEY.    The interned  Men-of-war. The British  high  commissioner  at Constantinoplesuggested that he should address a note to  the Turkish  government, in union with  bisFrench and Italian colleagues, warning it that if any of the interned men-of-war should
be destroyed the full value thereof would be exacted, and that if any should be sunk inthe harbour  and thereby cause obstruction  it, or they, would have to be raised ; andfurther that the Turkish government should be  informed  that  the allies reserved  to themselves the light to take any  preventive measures they might consider necessary.In reply to this on the  2nd July  Lord  Curzon telegraphed to  Admiral Calthorpe[No. 1103] concurring in his proposal and instructing him to concert measures with hiscolleagues.     On the same day, 2nd July, Lord Curzon also telegraphed to Lord Derby, in Paris,and  Sir  Rennell Rodd, in Rome, instructing them to ask the  French and italian governments to direct  their representatives in Constantinople  to act with  admiral calthorpe.     The Greeks in the Aidin Vilayet. On the  4th July Admiral Calthorpe transmitted[No. 1398] a report from Commodore Fitzmaurice, senior naval officer of the allies  atSmyrna.  In this report, which was  dated the  2m! July, the commodore said that theTurks had driven the Greek troops, some 2,400 in number, out of Aidin.     On the same day Admiral Calthorpe also transmitted [No. 1399]  a message, datedthe 3rd July,  from  Mr. Morgan at Smyrna.  The  latter said that the Aidin incidentwas attributed by the Greeks not so much to  Moslem resentment as to Italian  intrigue.The Italians were being insulted and attacked more frequently.  There had been too abad  case of a Greek guard beating a Turk in prison ; the latter had been removed  tothe American hospital.     On the following day Admiral Calthorpe  transmitted [No.  1402] a telegram fromMr. Morgan reporting  that the Greeks  had retaken Aidin ; and  on the 7th July he reported  [No.  1412] that  he  had been informed by Commodore Fitzmaurice that this had been done by the direct orders of M. Venizelos.   On the 7th July he also reported[No. 1411] that Mr. Morgan  had informed  him that during the Turkish  occupationChristians had been well treated.    Danger  of an  anti-Entente  Movement  in Western Anatolia. On the 7th JulyAdmiral Calthorpe transmitted [No.  1411] a message from  Mr. Morgan, who said  thatthe resistance shown to the Greeks  by the Moslem irregulars had begun to show atendency to develop later into an anti-Entente movement if Smyrna were not evacuatedby the Greeks.                                     SYRIA.     The American Commission. Telegraphing on the 7th July, Colonel French saidthat he had  seen the. American commissioners at  Damascus  a few  days earlier, andhad  been favourably impressed by their impartiality, earnestness, and ability.   they hoped to complete their work by about the third week in July.                                    ARABIA.     Mr. Philby s Mission. On  the 29th June  Colonel  French, telegraphing from cairo, transmitted [No.  E.A. 2 568] a message  sent from Jeddah by Colonel Wilson tothe following effect :      King Hussein  urgently  begged  that  the  negotiations with  Ibn Saud might  be conducted from the other side.  He would be glad for Mr. Philby to pay him. a visitat Taif, but he absolutely refused to allow him to proceed east of  that place :  the case,he said, was not sufficiently urgent to justify  the risk he would run, and, apart from therisk, his journeying  eastward of Taif would not only be very prejudicial to Britishprestige  but would [also do much harm in the country.  If his majesty&apos;s governmentshould insist on this route, King  Hussein stated definitely that  he would  resign, and colonel Wilson thought it probable  that  he would do so.  He  had spoken to EmirAbdulla  on  the subject,  and found that  he  agreed  with King  Hussein as  to  the undesirability of Mr. Philby&apos;s journey from  this end, unless  the  British governmentwas  willing to assume all responsibility  for  any  untoward  consequences.  He had promised to do his best  with the king but had no  hope  of changing his decision.     Colonel Wilson had already informed Ibn Saud that the meeting would take placeon the Gulf coast; and  he strongly recommended  that  Mr. Philby should travel by thequickest route via Baghdad and Bahrein, unless there were reasons of great urgency for sending him via Taif.     Ibn  Sauds Movements. In the same message from  Colonel Wilson it was also reported that  King  Hussein had stated that it  was definitely established that Ibn Saud
-had left Khurma eight days previously, and that the king appeared  to be easier in his mind in regard to the military situation.     Idrisis Subsidy. On the  20th June, General  Allenby reported [No.  1000] thereceipt of a recommendation from the resident at Aden that, till the restoration of thenormal sources of revenue by the raising  of  the blockade,  Idrisi&apos;s subsidy should becontinued at the  present reduced rate of 7,000L a month.   General Allenby added thathe concurred in the recommendation, and asked whether  it met with Lord Curzon&apos;approval.     Proposed Peace  Celebrations  at Aden. On the 3rd July General Allenby  trans-mitted [No. 1060] a message, dated  the  30th June, received by him from  the  residentat Aden.   The latter said that he considered it to be specially desirable, from a  political point  of view, to invite the leading  chiefs of the protectorate to Aden for the peacecelebrations.  He proposed to do this, and asked for sanction  for the expenditure of5001.  beyond the  100Z. already granted.  General Allenby  added that the matter beingurgent he requested authority  by telegram to  sanction the amount asked for.   lord curzon replied on the 8th July  [No. 823]  suggesting  that the celebrations shouldbe deferred till after the  peace  with Turkey had  been signed.   He  agreed, however,that for political reasons  it might be desirable to provide extra funds.                                    PERSIA.    Urumia coveted  by  both Kurds and Armenians. -On the  1st July Sir Percy Coxrepeated [No. 453] to the Foreign Office a telegram he had sent to Baghdad asking theauthorities  there  whether they were prepared, in  response to  a request from thePersian government, to intimate to  Simko, the representative of Kurdish  aspirations,that we had no intention of supporting the Kurds against  the Persian government, orthe integrity of Persia.    Sir Percy said that he had been informed by the Persian government that Urumiaand its fertile plain attracted the covetous eyes  of  both Simko  and the moving spiritsof the embryo Armenian state ;  and he had learnt  that the United States consul hadbeen told by one  of Simko&apos;s head  men that Urumia was absolutely necessary to theKurds.                                 AFGHANISTAN.    Letter  from the Amir and the  Viceroy s Reply. On  the 4th July the viceroytelegraphed a long letter received  from the amir  in  reply  to  his of the 22nd  June[E.R. CXXVI, p.  6j.  In this letter the amir ignored his true position as an unprovokedaggressor  then suing for peace  and  adopted  an  attitude of complete equality.   Hecomplained of the one-sidedness  of  the  armistice, and urged the Indian government towithdraw   its  forces  from Dakka  and  Spin  Balclak and  to  stop  aeroplaning overAfghanistan.    The viceroy thought that it was clear that the amir was really desirous of peace inspite  of the attitude he had assumed, and therefore, with  the consent of the secretaryof state for India, on the 6th July sent him a letter, in which, after pointing out that the amir failed to  realise his true position, which was that of a suppliant for  peace,  wenton to say  that  he agreed with him that no advantage was to be  gained by prolonging the correspondence, and  that the best  course would be for  the delegates to  meet assoon  as possible.   He therefore asked the amir to  direct his delegates to presentthemselves at the British lines before 10 A.M. on the 22nd  July.  No change could, theviceroy repeated, be made in the armistice  terms.
