The Present Situation, On the 15th May Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 452]his impressions of the conditions in Siberia  on returning there after a month&apos;s absence.In  some respects he  had found, he said, an improvement  in the  situation.   SomeSiberian troops had  gone over  to the enemy, and this  was  a  disquieting  fact, buton  the whole  the situation at the front  was  decidedly better.   The - policy of theJapanese appeared to have undergone a change ; they now seemed ready to keep GeneralSemenoff in order and to support Admiral Kolchak :  but, owing to  the difficulties inregard to the generafs future military rank,  a full reconciliation between these two had still to be arranged.     There  had been  an unfortunate  outbreak  of  anti-American  feeling which  hadculminated in a refusal on the part of the Kolchak government to allow the americans to guard the section of the railway in the Trans-Baikal district; and this in spite of an increasing  willingness on the  part of American  officials to support Admiral  Kolchak.General Graves regarded  the refusal as  an affront to the United States, but he, sir charles Eliot, was doing all  he could to help in bringing about&apos; friendly relations.   Thesituation was regarded by General Graves as very serious.   There were many Slavs and Jews who were Bolsheviks among the American  troops, and  there  was  some  evidencethat  the  Bolsheviks  were of opinion  that they could  look for  American  support.Russian officers stated openly that Bolshevism was encouraged by the Americans, andthey declared that any American soldier  they caught  would be punished by them.     In the far East Bolshevism, as contrasted  with  merd-  discontent,  had  increased during his absence so he had been informed by General Graves.   General Horvat had become commander-in-chief, that office being added to the others held by him.   GeneralIvanoff Rinoff had been summoned to  Omsk, probably because he was  distrusted hewas considered  by Admiral Kolchak to have been disloyal  in his negotiations  withGeneral Semenoff.  Whatever the reason, his recall would be helpful ;  he was  irritatingin his methods, and  General Horvat was much better able  to deal  with  Americans,being of an easy-going nature.     Russia and the League of Nations. Russia&apos;s position in regard  to  the league  ofnations was greatly exercising public  opinion, as had been intimated to Mr. Hodgsonby Admiral Kolchak&apos;s minister for foreign affairs.  The general idea was that she wouldbe left out of the league but  might be invited  to join later on  at the discretion of the       [756]-646             &quot;                &apos;                            B
signatory powers, i.e., that she would be placed in the same position as Germany andother enemy powers.   Though it was admitted that she could not  be  invited to joinnow, tbe position was regarded as ignominious ; and the minister for foreign affairs had urged that the allies should make a declaration to the effect that, though the Bolshevikswere outlaws and ineligible for membership, Russia  should enter the league on the same footing as her former allies so  soon as she had a settled government.   He said that the feelings of Russians were for various reasons somewhat irritated at the present time, andhe thought such a  declaration peculiarly desirable  as they would prove responsive totactful treatment.TTK.RAT.NA.    Bolshevism. On the 7th May Mr. Rattigan telegraphed from Bucharest [No. 272,received  17th  May] in regard to Lord Acton&apos;s telegram of the 21st April [E. R. CXVIII,p. 2] as follows :  The  views  on  Ukraina as  communicated to Lord Acton are totallyopposed  to those  held not only by the Rumanians but also by this legation and our military mission.    It is considered here  that there  is practically no difference between Bolsheviksproper, Petlourists,  Ukrainan  Bolsheviks, and  other Ukrainans.   The only reason whyany of the Ukrainan  parties  are opposed  to Russian  Bolsheviks is not that they areagainst Bolshevism, but merely that they wish to retain power for their own particularfactions.   The French undoubtedly held until recently  that something could be donein the way of establishing Ukraina as an anti-Bolshevik &quot; bloc,&quot; but  they now appear tohave  come round  to the view held by all other sections of opinion  here : viz., that allUkrainan parties are  tarred  with  the same brush and  are all  Bolsheviks  at  heart.Certainly any recognition  of Ukraina  by the allied powers, or  even  an attempt toestablish good relations with  that  country, would create  a disastrous impression inRumania.    It is true that the north western  portion of Ukraina is opposed to  the Bolsheviksproper, but I  cannot help thinking that the idea of assisting in the creation of a strongUkrainan army is  a very  dangerous one.   Such  an army would be a most unreliableweapon  and  would  very possibly be employed against Poland or Rumania, rather thanagainst the Bolsheviks.THE CAUCASUS.    Withdrawal of British Troops. On  the 15th May Admiral  Webb transmitted[No. 1043] a telegram which had been received from the British consul in  Batum inregard to a report of the coming withdrawal of British troops which had reached that place.  The news that the British force was to be  relieved  by Italians  had  been veryunfavourably received, and all circles and  nationalities were verging on  panic.   Themeasure  was  generally strongly condemned  on the ground that the Italians had no authority over foreign peoples ; and the only section  that took a contrary view was that ofa few  turbulent Georgians.   A prolonged period of strife and disorder  was foreshadowed ;and it was foreseen by Europeans that soon after the  arrival of  the Italian  troopsthere would be a general exodus.                                    POLAND.    M. Modzelexcshi to be charge d&apos;affaires in Berne. On  the  12th May Lord  Actonreported [No.  809]  that M.  Zaleski, who had just  returned from  Paris  for a few  days,had informed  him that he was to present his  letters of recall  to the  federal govern-ment on the 14th May, and that M. Modzolewski  was to succeed him  at Berne withthe rank of charge d&apos;affaires.  with which he had at last decided to be content.     Inaccurate Zionist Accusations,-On  the  14th May Lord Curzon telegraphed[No.  97] to Sir Percy Wyndham in regard to certain accusations which had been  madein a telegram sent by the Zionists of Copenhagen to Dr. Weizmann, and communicated by him  to  the  Foreign  Office.   The Polish legionaries  at Wilna were accused  ofpogroms, and it was further stated that among  the prisoners taken from  that placetoBialystok  were  Leib Jaffa, president of  the Lithuanian Zionist Organization, andthe author Niger, both  of  whom were said to  have been separated  from  the  otherdeportees, and to have been sent to some locality at present undetermined.   Sir PercyWyndham was instructed to make inquiries.     On the 18th he reported [No.  56] that it had been officially announced  that Jaffaand Niger had been released.  As to the alleged  pogrom  the American correspondent
of the &quot; New York Berald &quot; was in Vilna, on the day on which  it was supposed tohave  taken  place, and had found all quiet.   They had no  knowledge of any pogrom :had there been one, Sir Percy said, they would certainly have heard of  it.    Military Successes. On the 19th May Sir Percy Wyndham reported  [No. 89]that Sambor,  Samborstary, Rudki,  Komarno and Zolkiew in eastern Galicia had been occupied on the 16th May by the Polish army commanded by General Iwaszkiewich ;in Yolhynia Lutsk had been taken on the  11th May ;  whilst on the north eastern front the Poles had occupied Zwiegiany.                                    GREECE.    The Occupation of Smyrna. On the 14th May Lord Granville reported [No. 266]that there had been great jubilations in the streets on the publication of M. Venezelos&apos;telegram announcing the decision of the council of four that Greek troops  should occupySmyrna.   He  had  been  asked by deputations from  the municipality and unredeemedGreeks to convey Greece&apos;s gratitude to Great Britain, with the hope that other Greeksstill unredeemed might be liberated.                                    TURKEY.    The Greeks at Smyrna. On the  17th May Admiral Webb transmitted [No.  1060]the following telegram, dated 16th May, which had just been received from Mr. Morganat Smyrna; Greek  troops landed  yesterday  morning, 15th  May.  The occupationwas marked by great lack of discipline ; a collision with the  Turks  occurred nearKopursa and there was  isolated fighting  in  various parts.  The  Christian rabble was allowed much licence, and many Turks were unnecessarily arrested and  maltreated.There had been  looting of Turkish shops  and houses.   A Greek mob is in&apos;controlof the surrounding villages.   Smyrna town is now fairly quiet, apart from  looting andhunting  down  Turks.  The Turkish civilian administration is non-existent;  militaryand civilian casualties were Turkish 300, Christian 100.    On  the 19th May Admiral Webb reported  [Nos. 1072 and 1083] that a storm  of protest throughout western Anatolia had been  provoked by the  Greek occupation  of smyrna. , There had, too, been a flood  of telegrams, from the interior addressed to the sultan, to his government, and to the high commissioners; he himself had received over200 in three davs, and&apos; some  of them were  couched in  menacing  language.  He feltthat the situation in the interior was fraught with great  danger :  there was much talk of organising  a march in Smyrna,  and, in view  of the description given  by  admiral calthorpe of the state of affairs in that place, he feared that it and the interior might very unfavourably react on one  another.  On the previous day the shops in Stambouihad been closed as a sign of mourning.   No attempt was being made to repress peacefulexpressions of public sentiment.    Resignation  of the  Cabinet. On  the 17th  May Admiral Webb reported  [No. 57&quot;!that  the Turkish cabinet  had resigned, and that the following official  statement had appeared in that  morning&apos;s papers :      Relying on  divine  grace and  the confidence of  your majesty,  we assumed theburden of government in a difficult period like the present some two and a-half months ago with the object of ameliorating,  within the means at our disposal, the  painful resultsof five years&apos;  misgovernment.   Relying solely  on the dictates of our conscience andconvictions, we took every  step which  we considered necessary; but the latest decision taken by the  powers of the Entente regarding Smyrna has  placed  the cabinet in  a difficult position, as it has regarded the protection of the rights of the state and of thenation as the ersential object of  its endeavours.   I therefore venture to submit to your majesty that, as a result of our deliberations, we have reached the conclusion that it isin the best interests of the state that we should  be relieved of our functions, and thatthe task of  government should be confided to another cabinet.   In all circumstances weremain your majesty&apos;s obedient servants.     The New  Cabinet.-On the 19th May Admiral Webb reported  [Nos.  1083 and1084] that a new government had been formed as follows:          Grand vizier and Foreign  Affairs, Damad Ferid Pasha.         Sheyk-ul-Islam, Sabri Effendi.         &quot;War and Public Works ad interim, Shevket Targhut Pasha.
         Marine, Avni Pasha.         Interior, Ali Kemal Bey.         Justice, Wash. Effendi.         Pious foundations, Ramdi Efiendi.         Finance, Tewfik Bey.         PubJic Instruction, Said Bey.         Council of State and Commerce, not yet filled.         Minister without portfolio, Marshal Shakir Pasha.                    (  ,     This cabinet was  to a great  extent, Admiral Webb said, made  up of the; samepersons as the old one, but it was weaker.  The  grand vizier  himself regardecf it as temporary, with perhaps only a few days of life.     The imprisoned  leaders. On the 19th May Admiral Webb reported  [No.  1082]that tbe late grand vizier had informed him that he had found it most difficult to getthe prosecution  to frame proper charges  against  the-persons who had been arrestedpartly on the initiative of the Turkish government and partly  at the  instance of theallies : the charge against Enver for example bad been whittled  down to one of cutting down trees.  He, the grand vizier, had therefore asked whether those who had been arrested could now be sent to Malta.     Admiral Webb added that probably in the near future attempts would be made to release some or all of these persons, amongst whom were some leading  members of theC.U.P.  Till means could be found for sending them to Malta, General Milne was quite prepared to take  them over;  and it  appeared  to be  absolutely necessary  to anticipateattempts at release.     Brigandage  in Northern Anatolia. On  19th  May Admiral Webb transmitted[No.  1070] the  following telegram  from Captain  Hurst at   Samsoun :  Brigandageremains undiminished and the road between Samsoun and Bafra  and Alacham is  practi-cally closed.   Some slight activity is being shown  by the local  authorities, and the commandant reports that the brigand  Laz Suleiman  has  been  killed and seven otherscaptured in the direction of Bafra.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     Cause of the  War. ReuteFs agent at Simla  has  telegraphed  the followingcommunique which was issued by the Indian foreign department on 6th May :-      Events in Afghanistan, have moved with startling rapidity since  13th April, whenthe Amir Amanulla Khan held a durbar, nominally to  place the case of the murder ofthe late Amir Habibulla before it for trial, but in reality  to  secure its imprimatur tosentences he had already decided upon.     Despite  the ostentatious unanimity with which the durbar condemned  ColonelAli Raza to death as the  actual assassin  and  Sirdar Nasrulla  Khan to imprisonment for life for complicity, murmurings were heard amongst the audience, eveu before  it left the assembly.   Before many days had passed these grew in volume, and it was openlybruited abroad that an innocent man had been  executed and  Sirdar  Nasrulla  Khanequally innocently incarcerated in order to shield the real  assassins.     Accusations  against many of the new occupants  of  high  office were freely levelled,and  the name of Amanulia himself was  not spared.  Disaffection spread, especiallyamong the troops, who had been foremost in insisting upon vengeance for the murderedamir, and among the Afghan tribesmen and the mullahs, with  whom  Nasrulla alwaysstood in high favour.     Amanullaiis position now became one. of greater danger, and in this fact lies the explanation of the sudden change from his marked  demonstrations of friendliness forthe British government to open  hostilities.  The disaffection threatened  to grow intorebellion, when he resolved on the perilous measure of distracting the attention of his people from the internal troubles by embarking on war.     He sought  to win  over   the  soldiers  and  peasantry by  spreading  absurdlyexaggerated stories of  disturbances in the Punjab, and of rich bazaars and fair fieldslying defenceless at the  mercy  of Afghan invaders.  Incredible though  it may seem,the.se crude fabrications appear to have met, for the moment, with considerable successto judge by the events of the last few  days.     On the 2nd May Zar Shah Shinwari, of Ningrahar, acting,  as it now turns out, onorders from Kabul, moved  out  with  his  lashkar  (body of troops)  and murdered  five
coolies on the Khyber waterworks, and  the following day attempted  to  interfere witha caravan escort of  Khyber Rifles.   The same night a party of 150 Afghan regularsor irregulars occupied the water springs of Bagh, a spot just on the British side of the disputed boundary.     Ho^mg  against  hope  that Amanulia  might  see  the  folly of  his ways at theeleventh -hour the government of India decided to treat  this challenge as if it weresimply an  irresponsible  act of some  hot-headed   local  official,  new to office.   Theviceroy despatched an express  message to Amanulia couched in terms of sternestwarning, yet leaving  an honourable escape open to him.  A formal protest was  sent from  F hyber to the local official of  Dakka, but an  uncompromising reply was received on the 5th May.  Three regiments of the Afghan army with two guns have arrived  atBagh, while reports have also been  received of the  despatch of Afghan troops towardsvarious points on the  border.     The only answer to.a menace of this nature was, of course, to put into effect the preparations which  were always in  readiness against such a contingency.   The largebodies of troops  required are already moving  to their allotted  places of  concentration,while the dispositions necessary for the effective maintenance of internal order through-out India will be continuod unimpaired.     The attitude of our  own frontier tribes  has so far  been  admirable.  The Affidisremain staunch, and representative Juga Mohmands waited on  Sir George Roos-Keppelon the 5th May saying they were prepared to  fight on  our side if  supported  by our troops.     Although,  for  the moment, Amanulla appears to have secured some measure ofassent from his people in his policy,  already there are signs of disunion even at Kabul,and of the  existence of a party who  are not prepared to join  in  the betrayal of theircountry.  Particularly is there great speculation regarding the fate of Nasrulla Khanand Inayatulla (the amir&apos;s eldest brother).     There is evidence that Amanulla went to both  Sirdars in prison  and offered themtheir freedom in return for their assistance in leading the army against India.  Bothrefused,  out  of  respect for the  memory of the late Habibulla, whose loyalty  to theBritish government was, throughout his reign, the keystone of his successful policy.     According to some,  Sirdar Nasrulla  Khan has already died from poison in gaol.It is probably significant that no authentic news of the well-being of Inayatulla has reached the frontier for some weeks.     The Military Situation. On the 21st May the following communique was issuedby the India  Office  :      Reports  received from the government of India  state  that  our forces at  Dakka(within the Afghan  frontier and north-west of Landi Kota ) were attacked by the afghans in force on  the  16th May. The enemy were driven off, and the night wasquiet.  Our casualties are reported at about 130.     On the  17th  the first (Indian)  brigade, with  the  co-operation  of aeroplanes,attacked the  enemy  on  the  hills  to the west of Dakka,  which were  captured  by &apos;50  P.M.  Our casualties  have not yet been  reported.   The  enemy&apos;s strength was reported as eight  battalions with   guns, four of which were  captured, and  over  100enemy dead,  mostly regular troops,  have already been counted.     On the  18th the situation was reported by the G.O.C. first (Indian) division as very satisfactory.   Our pickets now hold the  hills to the west of Dakka, and Sherabadand Robat (about 2 miles north-west of Dakka) are occupied by us.     This successful action is reported to have had an instantaneous and beneficial effecton the tribes.     There is nothing to report from other places on the frontier.     The Khyber Rifles. Telegraphing on the  18th May the viceroy reported that  hehad been informed by Sir George Roos-Keppel that he had directed  the commander ofthe Khyber Rifles  to ask his men  individually whether they  wished to be discharged.At Landi Kotal 600 out of 700 had  elected to be discharged, and it was expected that much the same would be the case at Jamrud.  Sir  George had adopted this  course inconsequence of an alarming increase in the number of deserters.  In a  later telegram the viceroy said that  Sir  George had reported that our success  on the 17th May had had a good effect on the men, more  of whom wished to stay ; but it was felt that  theycould not be relied on, and the corps was being disbanded.   Only from 200 to 300 werebeing kept on, and  they would act as messengers.
G    The Frontier Tribes. Telegraphing on the 18th, 19th, and 20th May the viceroyreported that the Afridis and the Orakzais had informed Sipah Salar at Jalalabad  thatthey  certainly would not  rise unless they  were  given  large  quantities  of aims,ammunition,  rations  and  money: they  had,  they said, no  quarrel with the Britishgovernment.   The Mohmands were ostentatiously friendly : they were reported to havethoroughly looted an Afghan camp after the bombing of Dakka, and they had informedHaji Turangzai that if he tried to  come through their country be would be opposed.dhey  had also sent  a  message to Yakub  Khan telling him that if he  had any chanceof the Afghan throne they and many of the Nigrahar tribes would join him.    Kandahar. On  the 18th  May the viceroy reported the arrival in Quetta of theBritish  representative in Kandahar, who said that everybody there  was  buying  armsand that a jehad was being preached.    The governor had however treated him, whenleaving, in the most friendly way.    Letter of the Afghan postmaster at Peshawar to Amanulla. On the 20th May, theviceroy  transmitted the following  extracts  from a letter, dated 7th May, from theAfghan&apos; postmaster  at Peshawar to Amanulla :      Hearing that the post  office was to be searched I ordered armed resistance, as thewhole of my correspondence went against the British government.  If necessary,  1 would begin the holy war  in the haven of the city.  Hearing of this about 8,000 Peshawaris,both  Hindus  and Moslems, came to help to sack.  , That night  2,000  villagers from outside  offered their assistance.  I said I would invite them when the time came.   TheSikh  regiments  have assured  the Plindus that they look on Moslems as brethren andwill  not fire  upon them.  The government has not enough troops in India, and oftenmoves about  one regiment, consisting of two or three companies, to make a  display.In spite of many  telegrams sent by the chief commissioner, no regiments have arrivedby train.  British subjects will not supply recruits.   There are disturbances throughout India, and tr; troops if sent for  from England will not arrive in time.   It  has been givenout in  public meeting that  the amir is ready to help the Indians, and if war is delayedpeople will be displeased with the amir.  (?) cried with one voice they would not forgetoppressions and tyranny of British  government.   If after sealed leaflets have  been circulated and the [corrupt group] Sipah Salar&apos;s [corrupt group] especially refrains frominvading India, Hindus  and  Moslems will be much displeased.   It  is not expedient to delay and give time to the English to collect troops.o
