I SECRET.                                                                    g ^ APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No. LXXXI.I                                     RUSSIA.I    THE report chronicles a rapid march of events  in  Russia.  The Entente  PowersI now have definite points aVappui at  northern and eastern entrances to what was onceIdie Russian Empire and thus hope can be restored to the anti-German and anti-Bolshevik[elements both in Europe  and Asia.   Events are  forcing  the Bolsheviks not  only toIdeclare themselves, but also to action which cannot be misrepresented or misunderstood.[Russia  is going to be rehabilitated  either by the Germans or by the  Entente  Powers(however much both:  sides may pretend a policy of non-intervention.  The Entente[cannot for the sake of a political idea afford to see Russian man-power  or  Russian foodlused by Germany in this or a subsequent war.                                     TURKEY.I    However anxious the new  Sultan may be to get rid of Enver Pasha he cannot getI rid. of the  German staff officers  and  German troops who hold and control the vitals of Turkey&apos;s capital and  Turkish communications.   Besides which the organisation of the Committee of Union and Progress is  neither dead nor sleeping.                                    PALESTINE..     Now that the Germans have at  last been cleared out of the occupied territory it is to be hoped that no scruples about Hague conventions will prevent us from dealing with German financial and  commercial institutions, such as Wagner&apos;s at Jaffa, in such a way that there will be no temptation for  the pioneers of  German expansion in Palestine to return at the end of the war.                                     ARABIA.     Sir Reginald Wingates telegram, No.  1209, sets forth very  clearly the  divergence between the Saudite supporters in Mesopotamia and at Riadh on the one hand and the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at Cairo on the other.   King Hussein has every reason to  be anxious regaraing  the  present revival  of  Wahabi  schools and organisation.  Something might come of a meeting of the two principals if such could be[arranged.   But  if Ibn  Saud  gets the  reversion  of Hail as  a  result of a  victorious[campaign  against the miserable Ibn Rashid, King Hussein will  be  even more alarmed and disgusted than he has been by the Khurma affair.  If,  however, King Hussein gets Hail, or comes to an. agreement with Ibn Ra-diid, then Ibn Saud will become little less than  an open enemy of King  Hussein,  as the founder  of Hail and of the  Rashidite dynasty started  as a sub-governor of Ibn Saud&apos;s forebears.   Sooner or later we must choose between the rival claims of the Sherifial family and the Wahabite Emir to become the predominant power in  Central Arabia.   Any further assistance  given  to Ibn Saud, whether against  Ibn Rashid or elsewhere,  can but add to the distrust growing in King hussiens  mind regarding our ultimate intentions.  Were he unaware  of the terms of the Sykes-Picot  agreement published by the Bolsheviks and now being cleverly exploited by the Turks and Germans ; or were  Feisal  now at Damascus King Hussein could afford to ignore the Wahabi  movement.   As facts are  to-day  he cannot ignore  it, and he is genuinely  frightened both for his cause and his life.                                                                      W. O.

Sir Esme  Howard telegraphedfrom Stockholm on  the  8th August  [No.  2223] that  the Swedish  consul-general at moscow  had informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the staffs of the British  andFrench consulates at Moscow had  been arrested on the 5th August.   It  appears fromother sources of information that Mr.  Lockhart was also arrested.     News  has  since reached the Foreign Office that Mr. Lockhart, Mr. Wardrop,  andtheir staffs have been liberated.     Coming Evacuation  of British Missions. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to Sir EsmeHoward on the  13th  August [No. 1601], instructing him to do everything  possible to expedite  the immediate  evacuation of the British Missions in Moscow and Petrograd.,whether unofficial British subjects were allowed  to accompany them or not. Mr. Balfoursaid that  M. Litvinoff would be allowed to  leave this country when the British  andFrench Missions  had reached Stockholm, and to take  his archives with him if  similar facilities were given to the allied missions.  As  regarded private individuals, Bolsheviksin England would be permitted to return with M. Litvinoff if British subjects leavingRussia were allowed  to accompany the missions  and had safe conducts.     Mr. Lindley  at Archangel. Mr.  Lindley telegraphed on the  9th August [No. 60]that he had arrived at Archangel that morning,  and that the other allied representatives had arrived a few hours later from Kandalaksha.     The  Occupation of  Archangel. Mr. Lindley in  his telegram  of the 9 th  August[No. 60 J said that the only opposition  to our landing on the 1st August had come fromthe  fort.   After the  occupation the  Bolsheviks had retired to a  place about 10 milesdown  the line  from  which  they were driven by seaplanes.   They were at the time oftelegraphing within 100  miles of Archangel.  During their flight  they had committedoutrages of all kinds  in the neighbouring villages, and throughout the whole district thevillagers were now on our side.
    Protest against German Agression. The following Russian wireless message was sent&apos;out on the 7th August: M. Ioffe, representative of the Russian Councils &quot;Government inBerlin,  has transmitted to von Kuhlmann, Secretary for Foreign  Affairs,  our noteconcerning the violation of the demarcation line in the  region of Valuiki.   In view ofthe fact that the Russian  troops have attacked a German post near Kukhlmaliev-Assare,the most severe  measures  will be taken against the responsible leaders.  This incident isexplained by the bad impression which the German initial advance in this region has left among our troops.  M. loffe has drawn attention to the landing of German  troops at Poti, a Caucasian port,  to  the advance  towards  Tiflis, and to  the violations of thedemarcation line on the Don front, because it was said that this  last region constitutedan autonomous republic.  All these incidents are contrary to  the peace treaty.  As this treaty does not acknowledge  any new state formation, except  the Ukraine, Finland,and the separation of Poland,  Lithuania, and Courland,  the presence of German  troopswithin  Russian  territories is inadmissible, except those temporarily occupied by theGermans.   With the view to facilitating the imminent activities of the  Russo-Germanpolitical commission in Berlin, it is necessary to avoid similar incidents.SIBERIA.    Appointment of a High Commissioner. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed on  the 10thAugust to the Charge d&apos;Affaires in  Paris, and the Ambassadors in Washington, Rome,and Tokio, informing them that Sir Charles Eliot had been appointed High commissioner in Siberia ;  he would  control ail our  agencies  in  Siberia, with the exception  of thenaval and military commands.  It would, too, be his business to  strive to Secure the closest possible co-operation among the allied forces  and  their leaders, aud to  representHis Majesty&apos;s Government in all political questions coming before the allies.    [Sir Charles Eliot, who was formerly in the  Diplomatic Service, was, at the time ofhis appointment, principal of the University of Hong Kong.]    The Czech  Troops. Mr. Hodgson  telegraphed from  Vladivostock  on the 9thAugust [No. 113] saying that a message had been sent  to Professor Massaryk  in theUnited  States by Dr. Girsa, of the Czech National Council,  regarding the  situation ofthe Czech troops.  Dr. Girsa said that their numbers were diminishing ; that they hadan insufficient supply of clothing and munitions ;  and that their position was  dailybecoming more critical: the organisation of the enemy forces, on  the other hand, wasbeing perfected,  and they were constantly increasing.   If, he said, the Czech  troops in central  Siberia  could  not be succoured within the next  two  months  they  wouldbe lost,  as the winter would then be set in.    General Horvat and the new Siberian Government. -Sir  John Jordan  telegraphedfrom Pekin on the 6th August [No. 656] that on the previous  day Count  Martel andMr. Alston had had an interview with General Horvat and thought that he realised theneed of compromise.   He had protested his willingness to come to an understanding withother groups, but had insisted  on the principle of a personal government being accepted ;this, he was told, could  never be admitted  by the allies,  though  they offered their good offices to help bring about an understanding.    On the 9th August [No. 665] he transmitted a messsage received from Mr. Alstonand Count  Martel saying  that they had had a lengthy interview  with MM.  Lavrov andDerber, the President of the Siberian Government and the Delegate for Foreign Affairs,who in  the end had declared that, though they declined to enter into personal relationswith General Horvat so long as he continued to arrogate to himself the title of dictator,they were willing to enter into a discussion with those of his ministers who representedcertain  definite organisations.  They, Mr. Alston and Count Martel, would urge GeneralHorvat to nominate, without delay, members of his Cabinet to enter into relations withthe Siberian Government.    Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 667]  he transmitted another message from Mr. Alston and Count Martel informing him that General Horvat had nominatedthree members of his Cabinet (one  of whom  would be  replaced  by M. Vostrotin  on his return)  to meet representatives of the Provisional Government of Siberia.                                    TURKEY.    Germany, Turkey,  and Armenia. Sir Horace Rumbold in a telegram [No.  1279  J,dated the 3Jst July, said  that information had reached the military attaches department that Haladjian Effendi,  then  in Switzerland,  had stated  that German)&apos; supported the
Armenian claim to half of the province of Van,  including the  town of that name.Turkey, however, had refused both this claim and that to Kars.     The Sultan,  Enver, and Talaat. -In the  telegram referred to above  [No. 1279]Sir Horace  Rumbold also  said that the new Suitan saw the necessity for removingEnver Pasha from power,  and  thought of trying to replace  Talaat  Pasha by HakkiPasha, Ambassador at Berlin-information of whose death had since been received.   Hehad realised, however, that Talaat could not be so replaced, so he had insisted on making certain changes in the Government, and  would  oppose  Enver with the assistance ofTalaat and  the new ministers,  two of whom were personally inimical  to  Enver.   in another telegram sent on the same day [No.  1285], Sir Horace Rumbold said that theinformation  as to the views of the Sultan in regard to Enver had been  confirmed, andthe changes which, at the Sultan&apos;s request, had been effected in the Cabinet by Talaatwould in time bring  about, the fall of Enver.     Entente Propaganda.-Sir  Horace Rumbold telegraphed on the 11th August [No.1349] that he had been informed that the people  of  Constantinople  had read withsympathetic.interest leaflets which had been dropped by British aviators.  recently the German Ambassador had demanded an enquiry in regard to posters on the  walls  ofGovernment buildings and  mosques declaring that the real enemies of Turkey were theGermans.   Talaat replied  that the  offenders could not be found.  The Ambassadorthen had an enquiry made  by the German military police, and on the following  dayinformed Talaat that most of the  offenders- were in the Government service, for which.reason he said their punishment should be exceptionally  severe.   Talaat retorted that before inflicting  any punishment he  would make his own  investigations.   In thediscussion which followed the Ambassador went so far as to threaten that the &quot; Goeben &quot;would bombard  the city.    Sir&apos; Horace  Rumbol.d&apos;s  informant  was,  he said,  in  theconfidence of the legation.PALESTINE.        Deportation of Germans and Austrians. Sir  Reginald Wingate  telegraphed on    the 12th August [No. 36] that with the exception of 29 who had  been excused either    on the ground of ill-health or on that of old age, all Germans and Austrians had beenIf!  deported from Jaffa.        Recruiting  for  King  Hussein. In the  same  telegram  [No. 36] Sir Reginald    Wingate said that men were  enlisted at Ludd and  Ramleh, and  good results were  )  anticipated at Beersheoa.  At Jaffa 270 had already been enrolled.                                        ARABIA.II               ,        ;        King  Hussein and Ibn Saud.- Sir  Reginald  Wingate telegraphed on the 12th ,&quot;j  August [No. 1205] King HussehTs reply to the message conveyed to him by direction    of Mr. Balfour [E.R. LXXX, p. 6].   He reaffirmed what  he had already said in regard.    to Ibn Saud, namely, that be had no aggressive intentions whatever against him, and    he agreed to the suggestion that he should write to him ;  more than this, as a sign of    his good faith, he was willing to pay him a visit.  He  recalled that six months ago he    had proposed a marriage between his son Zeid  and a daughter or niece of Ibn Saud, but,v &apos;;  the offer had been rejected.   Khurma he looked upon as beyond doubt his own  affair.        In regard to Khurma, Mr. Montagu telegraphed  to the viceroy on the 2nd August&apos; -   saying  that  Mr. Philby   should  impress upon. Ibn Saud the  fact  that it  seemedH&apos;l  clearly  to  fall  within King  Hussein&apos;s sphere so that intervention by Ibn Saud was i  unwarranted; but he should  be assured  that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government was giving    attention to  the question of his future interests.  Mr. Montagu added that we couldflp  not allow ill-timed&apos;activities on the part of Ibn Saud to distract  the attention  of King    Hussein from the primary task of defeating the enemy or to prejudice his interests ; itffj  must be remembered that neither Ibn Saud&apos;s services  or  commitments in the  past nor    his potential utility in the future would bear comparison with those of King Hussein V/j  at the same time there was  no intention of disregarding his equitable claims.        On  the 8th August  the  political  officer &apos;  at Baghdad  telegraphed  certain    recommendations  in  regard to Ibn Saud&apos;s  demands.  He  suggested  that the latter    should be  informed that, as soon as conditions were  favourable for so doing, a special;    commission would be sent to determine the  boundaries of the  territories recognised, by          [898-108]                                                     B 2
the  treaty of the 26th December, 1915, as being  subject  to  him,  but that in themeantime  he  must abstain from pressing his claims at Khurma.  The political officeradded that apparently the only channel  into  which  Ibn Saud&apos;s activities  could  bedirected without danger of conflict with the King of Hejaz would be operations againstIbn Rashid.   He anticipated no great result  from such  operations, but recommendedthat  liberal funds should  be  provided for their  prosecution, together with a furthersupply of rifles and ammunition.     With reference to this, on  the 12th August, Sir  Reginald Wingate telegraphed[No.  1209] his  view of  the situation.  He pointed out  that Wahabism  was thekeynote; the Khurma incident  was only  a manifestation of the longdived antipathybetween  the  Wahabites  and the  Meccans.  The chiefs were Ibn  Saud  and  king hussein, and each desired  to force an issue which  would establish his  position vis-d-vis the other.  Wahabism was a sect - which could become  unmanageable and dangerous,and King Hussein was quite alive  to  this potential menace; probably too he felt thatIbn  Saud and  his sect could,  with  our  support, dominate  the politics of  Arabia.Formerly Mecca  depended  for protection on the military  support of Turkey ; now  weshould endeavour to maintain and  strengthen the influence of the staunchest anti-Turkunit  in  Arabia,  our  own  protege.  Sir Reginald  Wingate  considered that we  must accept King hussiens assurances in regard to Khurma and  uphold his right to punisha rebel Shaykh.     At  the same time he  appreciated the need  of returning  Ibn  Saud&apos;s friendship;Wahabism in less honest  and capable hands might easily become an  active menace.He agreed that he  should be liberally  treated  in the  matter of funds but urgedthat  munitions  should be given as sparingly as possible and  only  when  absolutely necessary.     If his views were accepted  he  further suggested that a  letter should be written toIbn Saud  pointing out  that  King Hussein had given  emphatic assurances  that  his action at Khurma was not directed against him, that he entertained no hostile designs,that  he was writing a friendly letter and  appeared most anxious for a reconciliation ;that  we were  prepared  to give  our good  offices  in order  to  bring about such areconciliation and an  amicable adjustment of difficulties,  but felt that the present time ofstress was unfavourable for  the settlement of such a complicated question as delimitationof boundaries though we  held firmly  to the treaty of December  1915,  and  desired toprevent, by all means open to us  agression against  his territory, the precise limits ofwhich could not at present be known.   Finally, a wish should  be expressed  that allArab leaders should exercise patience and conciliation and combine against the commonenemy.     As to Ibn Rashid, the latest information  was  that his  situation  was weaker, andthat there was a probability of his eventually coming to terms with  King  Hussein.Action, against him would provide a diversion for Ibn Saud&apos;s  energies.     The  Coming  Pilgrimage. On the  31st July  Mr.   Balfour  telegraphed to  Sir-Reginald Wingate [No. 954] suggesting that King Hussein should be asked whether he approved of the proposal to take the pilgrimage across-Arabia from Koweit ; this in,view  of his relations with Ibn Saud as  the  pilgrimage would pass through the latter&apos;sterritory.  Sir Reginald Wingate  replied  on  the  12th August  [No.  1208] that  king hussein had  said, in  reply to  the question  put to  him, that  no  one was  likely tointerfere  with  the  pilgrimage.   Sir  Reginald   Wingate also said  that it  had beenreported from Baghdad that  owing  to  shipping difficulties  and the  unfavourablecondition of affairs in  Central Arabia  probably the only  pilgrims from Koweit  itself would be a relative of the  ShaykdVs with a few others.                                     PERSIA.     The New Cabinet. Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on  the 11th August  [No. 692]giving the following list of  the new  Cabinet: Premier and Interior, Vossugh-ed-Dowleh ;Foreign  Affairs,  Mustaver-ul-Mamalek; War, Sirdab  Humayun ; Finance, Mushir-ul-Mulk ;  Justice, Nostrat-ed-Dowleh ; Posts, Mutassib-el-Mamalek ; Education, Naseer-ed-Dowleh ; Public Works, Dabir-ul-Mulk.

After  his release he especially  occupied himself with the co-operative movement.  The People&apos;sSocialist Party,  to   which he  belongs, is closely connected with  the Right  SocialRevolutionaries.  M.  Tchaikovsky has a son in our navy.     Manifesto  of the  neio Government. The new  Government of Northern  Russia has issued the following manifesto : The Supreme Government of the Northern Territory tothe citizens of the province and city of Archangel.  The Bolshevik power has fallen !     The Bolsheviks fled, because in the hour  of  their need they were unsujDported bythe populace, which detested them for their betrayal of Russia  at  Brest-Litovsk,  fortheir civil war, for the augmentation of universal famine,  for the destruction  of libertiesand  rights, for their  legalised system of robbery  and shootings, and  for their ruinationof the country&apos;s economic and industrial life.     The peoples&apos;  representatives, who were elected by  universal suffrage, are  now forcedto take into their own hands the government of the Northern Region, because, as yet,there is no legal Ail-Russian  Government.     These presents bring to common notice that  the highest governmental authority in the Northern Territory is &quot; The Supreme Government of the  Northern Territory,&quot;consisting of delegates to the Constituent Assembly, and  also of representatives of theZemstva and cities.     The Supreme Government considers itself to  be temporary and will  immediatelyresign the moment an All-Russian Democratic Government  is established, and commu-communication therewith is  made possible.     The Supreme Government undertakes  the following tasks:      1. The re-establishment of a single national  All-R,ussian Government  ....  and           also the re-establishment of local self-governmentin the North.     2. The defence of the North and of the entire nation against the insolent  onslaughts           upon  Russian territory  and the independence of its inhabitants made  by           Germany, Finland, and other enemy countries.     3. The reunion  to  Russia of  the  lost. districts by the desire of the  inhabitants           thereof.     4. The re-establishment of the liberties that have been crushed and the re-establish-           menfc of the true  organs of  popular  Government, namely : The Constituent           Assembly, the Zemstva, and the town Dumas.     5. The re-establishment  of  firm administration  of  justice assuring the citizens           satisfaction in their economic, social, and spiritual needs.     G. To guarantee  that the labouring classes obtain the land  they are  entitled to           by  right.     7. The defence of the rights of labour  in accordance with the political  interests of           the North and of Russia as  a whole.     8. To overcome the existing  famine.     The Supreme Government will immediately publish orders naturally resulting fromthe above programme.  It relies for support on all  the classes which treasure the aboveobjects.  . In particular, it expects to  defend the North with the  assistance of theGovernments and peoples friendly  to  Russia :  England, America, France, and others.It also counts on allied  assistance  against starvation and  financial  difficulties.   It is convinced that Russia&apos;s and the allies&apos; interests  in the struggle against  the foreignenemy are one  and the same.  It knows that the allies&apos; troops came not  to interfere in internal  affairs, and  that their arrival  is not against the desires of the local population.It therefore greets the allied forces  entering the North to struggle against the common
enemy, and calls on the entire population to greet them gladly, and to assist them by every possible means.     The Supreme Government proclaims the above, and calls  upon the people to keepcalm, to maintain order, and,to pursue their labours.     The Bolsheviks arrested at Archangel. .0nthe 14th August Mr. Balfour telegc^KeSr ,J[No. 23] to Mr. Lindiey that he  had informed M. Litvinoff that when Mr. Lockharfs .mission, the French and  British military missions,  the members of the French andBritish consulates at Moscow and Petrograd, and all other allied subjects, wishing to doso, had left Russia, the Bolshevik commissioners arrested by the allied forces at Archangelwould be released, and not before.SIBERIA.     Supreme Command. On the 14th August Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir Conyng-ham Greene [No. 786] that  so far  as  British troops were concerned  the view of theJapanese Government had been accepted ; that is to say, the Japanese would  have thesupreme  command of the allied forces operating in Siberia and based in  the Pacific.6
