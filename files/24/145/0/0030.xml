APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  XC.                                     TURKEY.    The Government  at  Constantinople  is obviously waiting for  the upshot of the communications between Germany and President Wilson before taking decisive action.The reported appointment  of  Izzet Pasha is more hopeful from  the point of view ofthose  who-  are  anxious to see the fall of the Committee of Union  and Progress ingeneral  and of  Talaat  in particular.   Izzet  is a burly Albanian,  a good soldier, and a simple-minded man of strong character.  In politics he is an an-ti-Jacobin (anti-Bolshevik)and has never been in the C.U. P.   He  would certainly stand by the new  Sultan.   the reported retention of the portfolio of finance by J avid however- points to. the  fact thatthe C.U. P.  still possesses political  power.                                      SYRIA.    EA^ery  telegram  tends  to  confirm,  the view that for the moment the Arab  leadersare genuinely  frightened  of French colonial ambitions in Syria.  In 1916  the  Arabrevolt was  encouraged by us alone, and the  Arabs regard us as  the trustee of  their claims and  national  aspirations.  They therefore look to  us  to  secure their position vis-d-vis our allies, a task which  is not altogether  enviable.   However disinterestedwe may really be, we are  regarded by the Arabs as  having taken  upon ourselves theresponsibilitv of seeing that they get what they want.

Mr. Clive telegraphed on the  11th  October [No.  3020]&apos; that he had  been  informed by the  consul at Helsingfors  that twenty-four British officials had  that day left Riihimaki for Tornea, all well.  Telegraphing again on  the-same day [No. 3021] he  said that his French colleague had informed him that M. Darcy (French commercial attache in Petrograd), M. Mazon (who had the  title  of attache to the embassy and was attached to the French consul-general), and Major Ducastel (aide- de-camp to the  French military attache) were not allowed  to come out; the two former were on the list drawn up by the  French consul-general.   At a meeting of the French minister, the French consul-general at Moscow, Mr. Loekhart, and himself, the French minister  had drawn up a telegram to the French  Government proposing that three of M. Litvinoff&apos;s suite  should be detained in  Norway until these three French officials were allowed out  and  had asked him  (Mr.  Clive) if he would send a similar telegram.  Mr.   Lockhart had agreed that the first two should certainly have been released with the  French consular agents.  Mr. Clive pointed out that we must  not risk an  accusation  of bad faith and that he  was  not altogether satisfied as to  the justification for  Major  Ducastel.  The French minister had  then said that not  only had the French military  attache  the right  as a  general  to be accompanied by his aide-de-camp, but the French  consul-general had  assured him that  M. Chicherin had definitely promised in the presence of the acting Swedish consul-general that the French military attache  should  be accompanied by two officers, and only  one had  been allowed out.  Mr. Clive had therefore agreed to telegraph  as proposed, and he suggested that M.  Litvinoff should be allowed to come forward at once with all his suite except three.      Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 3027] he said that Mr. Lockhart had read his telegram No. 3021 and expressed his agreement with it.   Should M. Litvinoff        [898-117]                             &quot;                             B
be detained any longer, in Mr. Lockhart&apos;s opinion, we should be guilty of a breach ofgood faith.  At a meeting on  the 11th  the French consul-general had stated that he-had  no reason to  anticipate  bad  faith on the part of M.  Chicherin  in regard  to the eventual release of ,the French consular agents : there  were, he said, practical difficultiesin the way of immediate release.     On the 13th October Mr. Balfour  informed [No.  2266] Mr. Clive  that he approved the course of action which he had suggested, on the assumption that,  after consultationwith the French minister, he and Mr. Lockhart were satisfied that  M. Chicherin hadfully and loyally carried the agreement  into effect, with the exception of the continued detention of the three French officials.     On  the  following day  Mr. Clive  acknowledged  [No.  3040]  the   receipt  ofMr. BalfouFs  telegram, and  said that he had requested  the  Swedish  Government toallow M. Litvinoff to proceed with all  his party but three, as, after consultation withMr. Woodhouse (who had arrived at  Stockholm with  his party) he was satisfied that,so far as it regarded  British officials, the agreement with M.  Chicberin had been carriedout fully on his part.     Continued Detention  of  British  Subjects  as Hostages. On the 12th OctoberMr. Robertson transmitted [No. 3558] a message from  the  Netherlands minister inPetrograd, saying that  in  all thirty-five British subjects would be detained in prisonas hostages so  long as  the measures taken against  the Bolsheviks in  the  regionsoccupied by British, French, and  Czecho-Siovaks should  be   continued.  The  SovietGovernment remained  firm  on this  point.  He was  continuing to  work for their liberation, but he advised that His Majesty&apos;s Government  Should issue a  declaration that it would abandon  these  measures, and would use its influence  with  the Czecho-Slovak commander to obtain a similar declaration from him.  Life in the  prisons was becoming even harder.NORTHERN TERRITORY.     Municipal Elections in Archangel. Mr.  Lindiey reported on the 16th October[No. 284] that the municipal elections had resulted in the return of thirty-two membersof the Socialist group, twenty-six of the Bourgeois group, one Jew, and one nondescriptof Socialist tendencies ;  only about 8,000 out of 21,000  electors had  voted, probablyowing  to general  political apathy.  The Bourgeois  parties had more  members  thanthey had expected.SIBERIA.     The Omsh Government. On the 7th October Mr. Alston  transmitted  [No.  131] atelegram which he had  received from the high  commissioner,  Sir Charles Eliot (thenat Ekaterinburg), who  said that he agreed that it  was  worth  while to support theOmsk Government.  There was still,  he said, among the working  classes in  all the siberian towns strong  sympathy  with the  Bolsheviks, though the  leaders had  fled ;there was not much  difference between that party  and  the  left wing of the  SocialRevolutionaries, and the Bolsheviks might easily regain a majority in  any town.   Thebest-security against events which would bring this about was the  presence  of czech troops,  and  the next  best  was  the  Omsk  Government.  &apos; But  it should  not be forgotten that  at present  the  composition of  that  Government  was  somewhatuncertain.     The Oufa Government. Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1522] to Sir Rennell  Roddon the 11th October, saying  that it was  considered that it  would  be premature torecognise this Government till more definite information had been received in regard toits status and prospects ;  but its progress was being carefully watched.TURKESTAN.   &apos;  Detention of British Officers. On the 8th  October Mr. Alston transmitted fromVlaclivostock  [No. 137]  a telegram received from the British vice-consul at Irkutsk,reporting  information  given him by Mr. Shaw, the vice-consul for the United States atTashkend, who was  then at Irkutsk.   Mr. Shaw said that when he left Tashkend onthe 11th September two  British  officers,  Colonel Bailey and  Major  Blacker, who had-arrived there at the beginning of August, were restrained from leaving the place, andwere under surveillance day and night.   Their arrest had been ordered by M. Trotsky,
but apparently the Bolsheviks were afraid to enforce the order, as five out of the twelvemembers of the local  council were opposed to so  doing, and the others felt that theywere  not strong enough to act by themselves :  the opposing members were SocialBevolutionaries.  The ultimate fate of the two officers would, Mr. Shaw said, to a great extent depend on the result of a parley between  the commander of the British troops at Askabad and  a Bolshevik  deputation from Tashkend.  With  the officers was  sir george Macartney, British  consul-general at Kashgar, who had not been able to leave,though he had been promised that he should return to Kashgar.                                    POLAND.    General Situation. Sir Horace Bumbold telegraphed on the 8th October [No. 1800]that the Berne representative  of the  Polish National Commission  had stated that,according to  news received from Warsaw,  Poles who  had arrived  from Minsk had reported that  the German forces had already evacuated the neighbourhood of that town,and that the German garrisons had been immediately replaced by Bolshevik [two groups undecypherable], sent by the Russian Maximalist Government.  From  otherPolish sources he had learnt that the White  Russian peasants were  massacring Polishlandlords.   In general all the . Poles in Berne were very nervous as  to what might happen all over the western part of  the former  Rnssian Empire if, as a result of theirappeal to President Wilson, the central  Powers should withdraw all their troops fromthose  regions. The  Poles stated that, thought here were not many  native Bolsheviksin Poland, there were already a good many foreign elements  of that  sort there, whichwould immediately be  reinforced from Russia  should  the  Oermans withdraw their troops.    A Coalition  Government  possible. Sir Horace Rumbold telegrahing on the 12thOctober [No.  1843] said  that according to the latest information received from Poland,as M. Kucharvaiwski had  abandoned  his attempt to  form a - Cabinet owing to  theopposition  of  the parties of the Left, it  was thought probable  that Prince. JanuszRadziwill would  try  to form  a coalition Government.   The whole trend of events in poland showed that the extreme Left was gaining power rapidly.  Sir Horace Rumboldadded that a  report was circulating in Polish  circles  to the  effect that  the Polishmembers of the Reichsrath  had decided to withdraw to (? Warsaw) in  a body as soonas the Diet  had been  convoked.  The Polish Press Bureau had, however, not  had anyauthoritative  confirmation of this rumour.    Manifesto of the Regency  Council. ReuteFs agent telegraphed from Amsterdamon the  8th October  that  the manifesto of the  Polish Regency  Council, after citingPresident Wilson&apos;s general peace principles, which it asserted lead  to the creation of anindependent Poland, said :          &quot; In  order to realise this the Polish people must act as one man and exert all    its strength so that its will shall be understood and recognised by the entire world.         &quot; To this end&apos; we have decided (1) to dissolve the State Council; (2)  to summon    immediately a Government composed of  representatives of all classes and. political    tendencies ; (3) to impose on this Government the obligation, in  conjunction with the    representatives of the political groups, to work out an electoral statute for a political    Diet based on broad democratic principles, and within a month at the latest  to lay    this statute before the Regency Council for confirmation and recognition;  (4)    immediately afterwards to summon the Diet and submit for its  decision the question    of the  further establishment of a supreme  State  authority  in  whose hands  the    Regency  Council, conformably to its oath, has to place its authority.         &quot; Poles, our destiny is now in  a great degree in our own  hands.  Let us show    ourselves worthy of the great hopes which&apos; our fathers cherished  for a century in    oppression and distress.   Let everything be silent which may sunder us,  and may    only one  mighty voice  be raised namely, that  of a  united  and independent    Poland.&quot;    The manifesto was signed by Mgr. Kakowski, Archbishop of Warsaw and Presidentof the Regency  Council, M.  Kutcharewski, the  Premier, and  Prince Lubomirski  andM. dOstrowski, members of the Regency Council.    Recognition of the Polish National Army. Reuter reports that the British Govern-ment has recognised the Polish national army as  autonomous, allied, and co-belligerent.
  In announcing this fact to Count Sobanski, the delegate of  the Polish  national council  in Great Britain, Mr. Balfour recalled that His Majesty&apos;s Government had repeatedly  announced its desire to see the creation of a united and  independent Polish State, and  it had been glad to join in the Versailles  declaration,  of the 3rd  June  last,  that  the  creation of such a State with free access to the sea constituted one of the conditions of&quot;  a solid and just peace.                                       TURKEY.      Peace Overtures. Mr. Barclay, telegraphing  from New York, reported on the 15th  October [No. 4660] that the following note from the Turkish Government  had been  handed to the  Secretary  of  State  on the 14th  October by the  Spanish  ambassador :  The undersigned,  charge d&apos;affaires of Turkey in  Madrid, has  the  honour, acting upon  instructions from  his  Government, to request  the royal  Government  to inform the  Secretary of State of the United  States  of America  by telegraph that  the  imperial  Government requests  the President of the United States  of America  to take upon  himself the task of the re-establishment of peace ; to notify all belligerent States of this  demand ; and to invite them to delegate plenipotentiaries to initiate negotiations.   It  (speciaP Government) accepts as the basis for negotiations the programme laid down by  the President  of  the  United States in  his message  of the  8th  January, 19 j 8,  and  in his  subsequent declarations, especially  his  speech  on the 27th September.   In  order  to put -an end to the shedding  of blood  the  imperial  Ottoman  Government  requests steps to be taken for the immediate conclusion of a general armistice on land,  on sea, and in the  air.      The New  Ministry. On the  14th  October  Sir Horace Rumbold  telegraphed  [No. 1870] that he had been informed that  according to a telegram which  had been  received by  the Turkish  legation in Berne, the  new Grand Vizier was  Hassan Izzet  Pasha,f and  that  the  new Minister  for Foreign  Affairs was Rifaat  Pasha, formerly  Ambassador in Paris.      On the 11th Sir Horace Rumbold had reported [No. 1829] the departure of Reshid  BeyJ and Oskan Effendi from Berne for Constantinople, on the summons of Tewfik  Pasha, to take  office in the  new ministry.  Oskan, an Armenian,  was, he said, one  of  Enver&apos;s bitterest enemies, and had fled to Switzerland  to save his life.      The Reason for the Change of Ministry. Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed on the  14th October [No. 1861] that the military attache had been  informed that the Turkish  minister in Berne had  stated that the reason  for the change of ministry was that  the Sultan  had urged  the  grand vizier  to sue  for peace  directly he  heard of the  Bulgarian armistice.   Talaat summoned a council and also the C.U.P. and it was decided  not to abandon the central Powers.   The Sultan persisted and Talaat resigned.   Halim  Pasha refused to form a ministry,  but Tewfik accepted the task : he,  however, found  himself confronted on  all sides  by  a reluctance  to take office, as doing so  involved  responsibility for disadvantageous terms^of peace.                                       SYRIA.      Dispositions for the Government of the Districts taken from the Turks. Mr. Balfour-  telegraphed to Sir Reginald Wingate on the 12th October [No. 1240] instructing him,  subject to General Allenby&apos;s  approval, to inform the  King of Hejaz as follows :-      1. That General Allenby, as commander-in-chief of the  allied expeditionary force,  will exercise supreme control  in the regions of Palestine and Syria liberated from the  Turks.     * ? Ottoman.     f The Admiralty handbook of  Turkish Personalities says that he is &quot; called the Von der Goltz of the  Turkish army.  . . &apos;. [He] was in command in the Caucasian theatre, but was made responsible  for Enver&apos;s  blunder  at Sarikamisfi. . . .  [He] has  studied in Germany ; is extremely active, and is a keen leader,  commanding considerable influence in the  army.   He takes absolutely no notice of Government orders if  they do not suit him.&quot;     J The Admiralty handbook says that he was at one time governor of  Jerusalem, then governor-general  of Aleppo, and afterwards Minister  of the Interior under Kiamil  Pasha -, also that he is exceedingly clever-  but corrupt.
    2. The commander-in-chief s control  will be for the present  exerted through thefollowing channels:     (a.) In Palestine through the occupied enemy territories administration under the           direction  of a British general officer.    (b.)  In regions east of the Jordan and in the Syrian districts through which the           Hejaz railway runs from  Maan to Damascus  through  the Arab  military           administration, as already recognised by the allied Powers, with which he           will communicate by means of a British and a French liaison officer.    (c.)  Ill the  event  of the allied  occupation being extended northwards, the same           policy will be pursued in regard to Horns, Hama, and Aleppo, in the event           of an Arab administration being established in any of these cities under the           same circumstances as  at  Damascus;  the  same policy will  apply  to areas           east of these cities, which  may be occupied by the  forces  under  General           Allenby.     (cl.) The region  along  the littoral must  for  the  present be treated as occupied            enemy territory;  and it has been necessary there to establish a provisional            military  administration directly under the G.O.C.-in-C.   The officers in            charge of this administration will be French, but will  be appointed by the.            British G.O.C.-in-G, and will  be subject,to his supreme authority.    (e.)  It will rest with the G.O.C.-in-C. to decide as to the boundaries between the            local Arab  administration or  administrations which may be  established in            Horns, Hama, or Aleppo, and the provisional military administration which            it may be necessary to establish along  the littoral.     The Situation in  Beirut.- In his telegrams  of  9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13thOctober [No. C2, 106,  110,  114, 115, 116, 117, 119, 121] General Clayton furnishedthe following information in regard to the situation in  Beirut :-     On the 8th October the Beirut paper contained a proclamation  by Emir Feisal tothe effect  that  the new Government which  had  been formed  in the name  of &quot; HisMajesty Sultan Hussein&quot; was based on the principle of equality for all peoples whospoke Arabic, and the people of Syria had now to  prove to the world that they were fit for independence.  The Government  included all the Syrian towns  and Ali Rida elRikabi had been appointed commander-in-chief.     With  this Shukri  Pasha  el Ayoubi* issued  a notice that he had  taken  up  his1-appointment as military governor. Commenting on  these documents, General Clayton saidthat Ali Rida el Rikabi was not commander-in-chief; he was the Arab military adminis-trator of occupied territory under the supreme control  of the commander-in-chief. nor was Shukri military  governor, as Colonel de Piepape bad been given the military charge-of the administration by the commander-in-chief     Shukri Pasha not only objected to the hauling down of the Arab  flag but refusedto relinquish his position till  he should be directly ordered  to do so by Emir Feisal, by whom he had. been appointed governor of Beirut  and its  district.   He flew the Arabflag over  the  palace and paraded the town  with an escort.  General Allenby sentinstructions to the British liaison officer at Damascus to request Emir Feisal  to orderShukri Pasha to withdraw from Beirut,  as Colonel  de Piepape  had been appointedmilitary governor.     Feisal replied that he could not officially recall Shukri without such loss of prestigeas might necessitate his resignation, unless  he were given a  personal assurance by thecommander-in-chief  (to be  confirmed in due course by the British and French Govern-ments) that the arrangements made  in  the. coastal area  were of a military characteronly  and  would not  prejudice the  eventual settlement to be  made  at the peaceconference.     On the night of the 10th October the Arab flags were taken down with all respect and without incident :  and  on the following day  Colonel de Piepape took up his dutiesat the palace.   When he heard of the lowering of the Arab flags the Emir Feisal was much upset and tendered his resignation : he was, however, persuaded  by the Britishliaison officer to postpone this till the commander-in-chief had reached Damascus.     Whilst this dispute in regard to  the governorship was acute, the municipality had shown itself anxious and willing to work with  the French military governor, and had    * The Admiralty handbook of Syrian Personalities says that Shukri el  Ayoubi is a Damascene, of between 50  and 60 years of age, and a pro-Arab.  He was formerly chef d&apos;intendaDce in the Ministry of War,but was retired by Enver Pasha : he was then made the same for the fourth army corps by Jemal. He is areligious fanatic.
hauled down the Arab flag.   Omar Daouk had been informed tha,t he was to continue  \at the head of the municipality under Colonel  de  Piepape, and had appeared to acceptthe situation.     On the 14th  October General Clayton  reported [No. 124] that an administrative staff had  been formed, with  the approval  of  the military governor, from  the chiefofficials  of the vilayet, and the &quot;majority of the  government departments  were now working:  whilst substitutes were being trained, indispensable Turkish officials had beenretained.     In another telegram of the same date  [No. 122] General Clayton said  that EmirFeisal had acquiesced in General Allenby&apos;s decision in regard to Shukri Pasha,  : and thathe had been satisfied in regard to the lowering of the Arab  flag since he had known that none other would be  flown.     Arab Attitude in regard to the French. Telegraphing on the 12th October [No.115] General Clayton said that, though it had  never been  officially  communicated tothem, thanks to Bolshevik indiscretions and  Jemal  Pasha the Arabs had a  good ideaof the provisions of the Anglo-French agreement.  Their distrust of French  intentionshad been thereby increased, and immediately on the  evacuation of the  coastal townsthey had nominated governors, availing themselves fully of the assurances given in  theForeign Office telegram of the 11 th June.  Matters were rendered more difficult by thefact that there was no French official of high standing and  wide powers  on the spot.That is,  no Frenchman could  deal with the problems on  which the Arabs requiredimmediate advice and assistance, whilst, in accordance with our agreements with France,we stood aside ; and these problems arose daily.  We had to hold the balance betweenArabs and French, and the situation was an unsatisfactory one; so unsatisfactory that should it continue we should inevitably be accused of bad  faith by French  and Arabsalike.     A considerable body of Arab opinion was opposed to the French Syrian policy,  andthis could only be conciliated by the  French dealing with  the problem seriously  and producing not only advice but material assistance; without this it was useless for themto reiterate their claims.     Beirut was regarded as the centre of French influence, and that being  so it  wasinteresting to note that our political officer in that place had reported that he estimatedthat only  10 per cent, of the inhabitants wanted autonomy under French guidance,  andthat of the balance 75 per cent, wanted autonomy  under British guidance, whilst 15 percent, would prefer to have neither British nor French.     Telegraphing again on the 14th October [No.  122]  General Clayton said  that hehad had an interview with Emir Feisal with  the result  that  his previous impressionshad been confirmed.  He  was  of  opinion  that the existing tension could  only be relieved by the French and  English  Governments immediately making a declaration inthe sense asked for by Emir Feisal, who maintained  that  the military nature of theFrench  governorships in  the coastal towns (which  had  aroused deep apprehension)could not conceal tbeh- political significance.   Nor could it, he said, prevent  the use of administrative power to the prejudice of the Arabs by the furthering of French politicalinterests.   He had also pointed out and emphasised the fact that the inhabitants of the coastal towns had taken the first possible opportunity to declare for the Arab Govern-ment.   He regarded himself as one who  had  pledged  his  honour  to  secure  theindependence of the  Arabs in Syria.     King Hussein and Syria. Sir  Reginald  Wingate reported on  the  13th October[No.  506] that Emir  Feisal had telegraphed  to King  Hussein announcing that theSyrians had accepted  him  as their sovereign,  and  that  the King,  accepting the sovereignty, had, until such time as he himself could attend  to their affairs, consignedthe care of the Syrians,  without distinction,  to Emir  Feisal.  These  telegrams were published in a special supplement  of the  &quot; Qibla,&quot;  of the  9th  October,  which  alsocontained an editorial comment which treated the  sovereignty over the Syrians as an-accomplished fact. These  announcements in the Mecca newspaper had greatly disturbedthe chief  of the French military mission at Jeddah.     Emir Feisal. General Clayton reported  on the 13th October  [No.  118]  that onthe previous day there had been a representative  gathering at the Young Arabs&apos; Clubin Damascus, at which Emir Feisal was present.  Tributes were paid  to the allies, andmore especially to England, in the welcome given to him, and in his reply he had given them some  excellent advice.   Subsequently, in conversation,  the  French liaison officer
 took exception to certain of Emir Feisafs remarks, but his British  colleague found nothing objectionable in what he said, from a political point of view.     In  another telegram [No.  115] General Clayton remarked  that Emir Feisal was very suspicious in regard to French intentions, but towards us his attitude was one of complete confidence.    $$Progress  of  General Allenby&apos;s Army. On the  16th  October  the War Office announced  that  General Allenby&apos;s force had occupied Baalbek on  the 9th October, Tripoli on the  13th, and BZoms  on  the 15th.  The air  force had reported on the 12th that the last mentioned had already been evacuated.                                   PALESTINE.     General Situation.- On the 14th October General Clayton reported  [No.  125] that the general  situation in the newly occupied territory was satisfactory, and that the military governors continued to report almost universal  satisfaction at our victories. He further reported that  13,000  refugees  had  returned to Gaza,  and  over 4,000 to Jaffa.                                     ABABIA. HEJAZ.

On the 11th October  Sir Rennell  Rodd  telegraphed  [No. 735]  that the  Italian Government had agreed to recognise, formally, as belligerents  the Arab  forces fighting with the allies  against the Turks in Palestine and Syria.                                     PERSIA.     General Political Situation. Sir Percy Cox, in a telegram [No.  883] sent from Teheran on the  14th October,  said that the favourable trend of affairs in Europe was generally recognised and  rejoiced over, and it was hoped that  Great Britain would now take a more friendly line  in regard  to Persia.     But this did  not make Vossugh-ed-Dowleh&apos;s position any easier : on the one hand it was  felt  that his was a packed  Cabinet, put in by our insistence, and unable to last long on its merits, and on the other there were  many moderates hoping for the loaves and fishes.  Sir Percy Cox was  of opinion that the personnel of the Cabinet should be strengthened, and that  in return for a franker  co-operation  we should  if possible expedite the issue of a friendly announcement of policy.     As  things were,  the  position  of  the  Cabinet grew  weaker   daily.   Besides Vossugh-ed-Dowleh himself, the only members who  carried any weight were Farman Farma&apos;s son and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mushaver-ul-Mamalik ; and the latter of these was undoubtedly playing for his own hand and against Vossugh.     The  Shah&apos;s  uncle coveted Farman Farma&apos;s  post, and  something was going on, probably with his connivance,  to oust the latter : but Sir Percy  Cox had been assured by  Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  that the Cabinet had no idea  of allowing this to be done.     The Grown Prince. Sir Percy Cox reported  [No. 871] on the 10th October that the Crown Prince was placing his troops, some 2,000  in number, at the disposal of the Turks for local purposes, and  was helping  them to the best of his ability to obtain recruits for their army.  At the same time he was adopting a strong anti-ally attitude in (? local) affairs.   The explanation of all this was that the Turks had promised that he should be made governor-general of the new province  of Azerbaijan.     Enemy Propaganda. On the 13th October, Sir Percy Cox reported [No. 880] that it had been  spread about Teheran that the allies had consented to recognise the inclusion of  Persian Azerbaijan in the  Turkish Empire if Turkey  would now make a separate peace.  The Turkish embassy was doubtless responsible for  this bit of propaganda which was causing some stir in Teheran.     In reply to this, M.r. Balfour telegraphed to Sir  Percy Cox  on the 16th October [No. 539] informing him that the Persian minister had enquired  on the 15th October whether the Turks had made any such proposal to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and had been formally assured that no such  suggestion had been made; and that if made in the future it would not  be entertained.  Sir Percy Cox was authorized to give a  similar-assurance to the Persian Government.
     Captain Noel&apos;s  Captivity. Sir Percy Cox, in  a telegram  [No.  878],  sent  fromTeheran on the 11th  October, said that  Captain  Noels  account of his  captivity,of  which  he was  posting  a copy, showed  that  the  treatment  received  by  him was exceptionally brutal, and that therefore some enhancement  of  the  claim  for compensation seemed  called for in his case.   He, Sir P. Cox, suggested an  additional500Z.  In intimating to the Persian Government that the  claim might be  enhanced inCaptain Noels case, he was reiterating Sir C. Marling&apos;s request for the payment of thefour original amounts approved in telegram No. 211  of  the 20th April [E.R. LXVj^p. 5]plus the value of property lost.     The reply to the  two previous communications had been that, on principle, thePersian Government could not accept liability for damage  suffered by foreign  subjects on  account  of  the  gratuitous operations of  belligerents  on  Persian  soil,  and  he anticipated a similar reply now.     Meanwhile the sufferers were put to lively [sic]  financial embarrassment owing tothe loss of all their property, and the necessity for replacing it.o
