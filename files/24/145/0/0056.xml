On  the 8th  April Sir Charles  Marlingtelegraphing from  Copenhagen [No. 874]  reported the arrival  at that place of  M.Navaschine director of the Moscow Red Cross.     According to the latter Bolshevism was rapidly losing ground in Russia :  many who had only joined the movement for the purpose of saving  their  lives were wishing to keep the money they  had made and to increase their capital.  M.  Lenin had, he said,recognised the fact that  a &quot; new bourgeoisie &quot; was taking the place  of communism, andwas allowing co-operative  societies to  come into existence and to exploit  forests, &amp;c.Everybody was prepared for the fall of M. Lenin and his comrades.     He said too that M. Kdschkine, who was minister of the interior in M.  Kerensky&apos;sgovernment, had stated that  already there were some ready to assume the succession to MM. Trotsky and Lenin; and  that in order  to step into the shoes of the  latter atthe right moment  it was necessary to work with them ; he referred to  men who hadnot abandoned Russia but had remained there and taken a practical part in affairs asofficers, officials, engineers, members of co-operative societies, &amp;c.   M. Kischkine thoughtthat the fall of Bolshevism should not be brought about too soon, but that time shouldbe taken so as to prevent the  inrush of the emigres of whom  there was a considerabledistrust; it was feared that they would work for the restoration of the monarchy under german auspices and create chaos.   In the interval everything could be arranged withthe sounder elements.  The allies, he thought, should send a relief commission  withfood, by the distribution of which they could become masters of the situation :  it would,in his opinion, be madness to negotiate with the Bolsheviks.     The Bolshevik Leaders. On the ,11th April Mr. Bell telegraphing from Helsingfors,transmitted  [No.  192]  the  following message  from Mr.  Parker :  I learn on excellentauthority  that  MM.  Lenin, Trotsky, [and  others named] are favourable to an under-standing with the Menshevik and Social Revolutionary parties, with the idea of forming a  provisional government previous to  establishing  a constitutional government.   The
only impediment is the present economic situation.   If therefore rhe allies intend to aidPtussia with the necessary supplies no time should be lost in making this known. ....     The  great  fear  in  Russia  is that  we  want to reinstate  all  the autocraticbureaucracies, the plutocrats and  intriguers who have left Russia, and if this fear couldbe removed the Russian situation would rapidly improve.     Bolshevism and the Jews. In an article headed &quot; The Jew as Bolshevist &quot; in the&quot;Morning Post&quot; of the 10th  April, it  is stated  that information &quot; received from an absolutely trustworthy source &quot; shows that ,&apos;&quot; there has been a startling change in publicopinion.&quot;   The writer says that  the pent-up  indignation of the working classes at theterrible economic conditions combined with  the despair of the intelligent classes &quot; must inevitably end in a violent  outburst which will almost certainly choose the Jew as itsscapegoat.&quot;  He continues : -     How  far  the  Jews were behind  the  Bolshevik revolution, and how  far they areresponsible for its horrors,  is still a matter of discussion.  That they have profited by itis bej^ond dispute.   The civil administration  of the country is entirely in  their hands,though in the ranks of the army and  navy  they are  conspicuously  absent.  Thereare  a  certain  number of  Jews in  the purely  political post of regimental commissar,but  in  some  mysterious  way  the great mass  of Jews  has entirely avoided  militaryservice.   In  Petrograd 60  to 70  per  cent, of the responsible posts in. the central fooddepartment  are  held by  Jews.    In  many parts  of  the  provinces the. purchasingcommissions  are entirely  composed of Jews,  who control  the  prices.  The  Prussianpeople have long remarked that in ordinary life the Jews have succeeded by some meansor other in avoiding the greater part of the misery suffered by the rest of the population ;thus a Jew  is never to  be seen standing in a food queue;  and there is a widespreadbelief that it is his race which is responsi ble for the utter wretchedness and suffering ofthe whole nation.  ,It is therefore of vital importance that the allies  should be preparedfor the serious developments which may well arise out of this bitter animosity.     Warning to the Soviet Government from the French Legation in  Stockholm-- On the9th  April Mr. Clive reported [No. 673] that  the  following communication  from  theFrench legation in Stockholm had appeared in the press: It has come to the knowledgeof the French government  that the  Soviet government has granted or promised foreigncapitalists concessions for building railways and the light to use canals, ports, forests, &amp;c.     The Bolshevik government only exercises a de facto governmental authority, which ismaintained by terrorism, and it cannot be considered to have sovereign rights or even theauthority which  a de facto  government may  possess  over  the national territory of astate ; it  cannot  pledge Russia&apos;s sources of income or sell the pledges of its  claimants.     Consequently any concessions granted by  a Soviet government  or district and orby local governments is regarded as invalid by the French government.     The Defence of Russia.--The following wireless message was sent out from moscow on the 11th April :      The central  committee  of the . Russian communist party proposed that  all party organisations and particularly the  trades unions should take a series of measures forthe enrolment  of a greater number of workmen for the defence of the country.   Themobilised men  must see the participation of the trades unions in this task and must be assured of the constant support  of the  working classes.   The registers of the trades union must be revised, and all members  not absolutely necessary at home should be  sentto fight  in the volga and Ural districts.  The  most serious consideration must be givento the spread of propaganda among the Red army recruits and those already mobilised.The workmen  should carry on propaganda by individual efforts and  in organised groups.For this purpose the workmen must revise their registers of members according to theirprofessions and -political views.   Special cards must be given to  members of  all trades union and to  all employes- proving their participation in the work  of helping the  red army.  A relief bureau or committees for the defence of the country must be  organised immediately through trades unions, works and factory committees,  party  organisation,local and central co-operative societies.  The special work of this bureau must consist insupplying the Red army.    With the assistance of trades  unions  a greater number of&apos; peasants&apos; from non-agricultural governments should be made to enlist in the Red armyand in the food supply detachments in the Don and in Ukraina.     The  following  is our  attitude,  under the present circumstances,  towards theMensheviks  and the Social Revolutionaries : All those assisting  Kolchak,  intentionally
pr otherwise, will be imprisoned.  All Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries desiring toassist us should be encouraged and entrusted with  work, principally that of givingtechnical  assistance  to the  Red  army  at  the  base;  this  work  must  be strictlycontrolled.  The central executive committee appeals  to  all organisations, parties,  andto all trades unions, requesting them to work as befits revolutionaries and not accordingto the old standards.    We can defeat Kolchak quickly and finally, because our victoriesin the  South are daily improving our international  position  and  guarantee  our finaltriumph.     We must exert all our strength and must make the utmost use of our revolutionaryenergy.  Kolchak will be soon defeated.     The Revolutionary Tribunals. The following wireless message was sent out from moscow on the 12th  April:  According  to  the new arrangements,  political  offences against the achievements of the October revolution come under the jurisdiction of therevolutionary  tribunals.  The latter are elected for  one  month by the local councils.Judicial investigations will be carried out by a special commission and musb be completedwdthin  a  month.   If  a prosecutor  is considered  necessary, a. counsel  for the defencemust also be called in.   The sittings are public and the accused has the last word.   the appeal  must be laid  before the appeals  tribunal  of  the central , executive committeewithin forty-eight hours after the sentence has been pronounced.     Speech by M.  Lenin. On the  12th  April the  following  wireless  message  was despatched from Moscow :      At a plenary  meeting of the All-Russian soviet of trades unions M. Lenin said :It is necessary to put an end to civil war once and for all.  So far our forces have been concentrated in the south,  and we have slightly weakened our  eastern front.  We neednot complain of this, since  we have conquered Ukraina and the Crimea, and our victoryon the Don is certain.   Our victory is assured all  over the world.  In the interior ofEurope and of America the position is very satisfactory.  One might say that Mr. Wilsonand M. Clemenceau have decided  to help us.  The Soviet government is gaining moreand more friends in all countries.   Only one enemy still opposes us;  the last  decisivebattle is before us.  In a few months we shall have  made an  end of Kolchak.  Propa-ganda both  on the front and in the country  itself is  most important for victory.   Wemust return to the old pre-revolutionary method of -personal  propaganda.  In  ourstruggle against  Kolchak  we call  Minimalists and  Social Revolutionaries  honestlyanxious to help us to take  part at least in work at the  base, but we abandon all thosewho, pretending to acknowledge Soviet power yet wish to play the part  of parliamentary opposition.  This is not the time for political disputes, for discussing minor faults in theadministration or tbe unworthiness of local Soviet representatives.   We  are well aware ofour deficiencies.   We are forced to make use of many unqualified, inefficient, and partlyunworthy elements.   But it is impossible to make these faults our first consideration atpresent, for now is the time to  decide  whether .to  serve the  counter-revolution aspersonified by Kolchak, or  to support the workmen as represented by the Soviet govern-ment.   There is no middle course.     Exchange of Prisoners On the 12th April Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 229] toMr.  Bell,  at Helsingfors,  informing him, in reply to  his  telegram of the 1st  April[E.R. CXV. p. 2], that he might treat with the Soviet authorities, on the lines he had suggested in that telegram, on.  a  purely unofficial  basis.   At the same time he pointedout that matters had been  greatly delayed by the failure of the Soviet  government toreturn a definite reply to the original proposal for the exchange of prisoners against thetwo  persons mentioned in his telegram.     Extension of State Control. According to  a   wnreless  message sent out  from moscow on the 13th April, the central  executive committee has promulgated a decreefor the  extension of state control of all central and local commissaries.     Compulsory  Vaccination. A wireless1 message  despatched from  Moscow on the13th April made known that compulsory vaccination was to be introduced for the  wholeof Russia.UKBAINA.     The Evacuation of Odessa. On the  1 Oth  April Admiral Calthorpe transmitted[No. 731] a telegram from  Mr. Cooke, consul-general at  Odessa, in the  course  of  whichthe latter said that the prestige of the allies had suffered deplorably in consequence
of the evacuation of  Odessa,  and  it  was difficult  to  see  bow  it  could  be restored,&apos;Russians  of  the better  class belonging to the town regarded  themselves as havingbeen betrayed ; and though the British were not considered as  having been directly responsible for the evacuation they  shared the odium consequent  on the conduct ofthe allies.SIBERIA.     Camouflaged Bolsheviks.- Telegraphing from  Vladivostock  on the  11th April[No. 350 A] Mr. Robertson transmitted  a  telegram  sent  two days  previously  by the consul at Irkutsk.  The  latter  reported that in  the surrounding villages,  and in thedistrict generally, there  was considerable  unrest and agitation, which was attributed to persons who set themselves out as  Russian prisoners of war returned from Germany.According to  his  informant however  they were  in  reality Bolsheviks  armed withdocuments taken from such prisoners.                                    POLAND.     Soviet Protest against the Proclamation of Martial  Law  [E.R. CXV,  p.  4]. According to a wireless message sent out from. Warsaw on the  12th April the sovietof workmens deputies has expressed  a strong protest at the proclamation of martial law ;  and has decided to support in every possible way  the strike of labourers employedin factories working for the ministry of war.                                    TURKEY.     Insecurity in the  Interior. Telegraphing from Constantinople  on  the 7th AprilAdmiral Webb reported [No. 716] that disorders were rife in the interior of Turkey, whereinsecurity was  steadily on the increase.   There was  no  improvement in the situation at Smyrna. Brigands, some Greeks others Turks, dominated  the country within a fewmiles of Constantinople on the other side of the Bosphorus ;  and these brigands weremurdering,  cutting off ears, and committing other atrocities.   Turks and Greeks,on the one hand, Turks  and Armenians, on  the other, were  ready in all  parts of theempire to spring at one another on  the slightest provocation.   Admiral Webb addedthat in many parts of the interior  the  people were  still  in absolute  ignorance of theEntente victory, in the absence of the  only argument really understood by  the Turk ashow of force.     The Committee of Union and  Progress. In his  telegram of the 7th April [No. 716]Admiral  Webb  also  reported  that, the  C.U.P. had taken full  advantage  of theopportunity  for  secret  reorganization  afforded by the  breathing  time ;  and  colourwould be lent to  its  secret propaganda when  the  recent  events in Odessa, in Egypt,and elsewhere became known.   At  present  the  news  of these  events was rigorouslysuppressed by the censor, but it could  not be permanently concealed.     The  Grand  Vizier&apos;s Proposals. In the same  telegram  (No. 716] Admiral Webbfurther reported  having received a visit from the grand  vizier, who, in consequence ofthe apprehension he felt at the state of affairs and  the activities and intentions of theC.U.P., wished to make certain concrete proposals for dealing with the situation.     He had proposed that a strong committee  should be set up in Constantinople toconsider  proper  remedies; and that  then  two commissions,  each  vested  with fullexecutive powers and presided over by a  prince of the blood,  should be sent to theinterior to take suitable action in the name of the government.     Admiral Webb  went on to say that he had  been  asked  by the grand  vizier  toappoint British officers to serve on the  central  committee  and  on the roving commis-sions : but he had replied that at  the present juncture  British officers could not be directly associated with a task undertaken by the  Turkish government  to  meet  a situation  for which it alone was responsible.   He would however ask General Milne togive instructions to his representative in the interior  to help the commissions  by placing at their disposal  complaints  received against the  local administration and information in regard to local conditions.     Admiral Webb added that he was convinced that the proposals made  by the grandvizier were the outcome of a genuine intention, not only on his own part,  but also onthat of the  Sultan, to deal  with a situation which was rapidly becoming one of  thentmost gravity and anxiety.   General Milne had agreed to  help in the way suggested.
     Kiamil Paslidthanged. Reuter&apos;s Constantinople agent reported on the 12th April,that sentence  had been delivered in the case of those responsible for the deportationsand massacres [of Armenians] in the  Yozghad district.     The  death penalty was pronounced against the governor of the  district, KiamilMahmud Pasha, while the ex-commander of gendarmerie of Yozghad was sentenced to fifteen years&apos; detention in a fortress.     An imperial  irade confirmed the death sentence, and  Kiamil Pasha was publiclyhanged in Bayazed  Square, Stambul, in the presence of the military  governor ofConstantinople and other high officials.    Resignation of Jemal Bey.-Beuter&apos;s  Constantinople agent reported on the 10thApril that the minister of the interior Jemal  Bey had resigned on account of thedivergence of views between him and the grand vizier on the subject of the suppression of the intrigues  of the C.U.P..  He had been succeeded by  Mehmed  Ali Bey, whosepost as minister of posts and telegraphs had been taken by Abdullah Bey.  The presscounted upon Mehmed to act with firmness in prosecuting the members of  the C.TJ.P.,and to take swift measures against the criminal bands.                                    GREECE.    Ex-King Constantine. On the  13th April, telegraphing  from  Berne [No.  635],Lord Acton reported  that King Constantine had quarrelled with his wife on political grounds, and was arranging to make  a statement to the Havas agency to the effect thathe had backed  the wrong horse.  He, , Lord Acton,  had been  told by some VenezelistGreeks that King Constantine would sweep the board at the next Greek election.  Hehad also been informed that King Alexander would be only  too  ready to abdicate infavour of his father.                              THE  ARMENIANS.    Anti-Armenian Movement in Egypt. On the 13th April  General Allenby reported[No. 570] that the anti-Armenian movement had proved to have been on a considerable scale.  It was worst on the 9th April!, when apparently many outrages on persons and property were committed.   The total deaths, up to the present, numbered 29,  hut fullerinformation would probably increase this figure.    The movement was said to have been initiated by an obscure and disreputable body of&quot; young Turks&quot; sympathizers, possibly in collusion with  the students.  Tbe Armenianleaders  appealed  to   the  El Azhar  authorities  to use their  influence and  [group undecypherable],  but  there had been no cessation of outrages.o
