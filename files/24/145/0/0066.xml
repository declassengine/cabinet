On the  13th  June Colonel  Robertsontelegraphed [No. 544] the general drift of two long telegrams from Sir Bernard Pares.     Krasnoyarsk, the latter says, is the principal centre of Bolshevik activity, moneybeing distributed thence to Bojshevik bands.  The  leader  of  the  so-called &quot; peasants&apos;army &quot; (really brigands) has his headquarters in the forests  east of Minusinsk and haslinks with  the Chernovites&apos;  insurrectionary  committees  in  Japan and China,  theChernovites&apos; agents from Moscow bringing money and correspondence by use of passportsbelonging to Siberian prisoners returning from Germany.     The military governor, Rozanoff, is  hated  owing to his drastic measures in regardto the reprisals which have favoured the Bolshevik revival.     Sir Bernard urged  respect for elective institutions and  the trial of arrested persons,and  informed the  zemstvo&apos;s representatives that  the  British government favoured anational representative  assembly.   Representatives of the co-operatives reported to himviolent acts of the government against well-known moderate Socialists who had strongly opposed the Bolsheviks.  They blamed Admiral  Kolchak&apos;s surroundings for this.     There is universal enthusiasm in Krasnoyarsk for the Kara Sea route.     Novonikelaievsk is the centre of the distributive  co-operatives.   The  latter  would welcome a visit from British co-operatives and the exchange of individual workers for mutual  information.  Suggestions were made as to sending students  to England (withrequests for text-books and  teachers) as well as for the exchange of information in thepress.     &quot;All my information  leaves  no doubt,&quot;  Sir Bernard says,  &quot;that  the Siberiangovernment under certain  reactionary influences  is  making  crucial  mistakes in the artificial manufacture of Bolsheviks in  Siberia  by a policy of military, land-owning,capitalist  revenge, by disregard of and hostility to elective institutions generally andby the wholesale and indiscriminate application of punitive measures among the peasants.Private traders wish to apply hostile state legislation  to the co-operatives.   Impartialinformation which  I have  sought represents speculation as being  much more prevalentin private firms, although it is  everywhere;  also it entirely  contradicts the charge  thatthe co-operative is  a supporter of Bolshevism.  The non-government newspapers arebeing stamped out.  There exists  no considerable element in  Siberia to support such
measures.   I  find, a  very general  desire for the overthrowal of  Bolshevism and areasonable constitutional regime, with a return to normal economic life.&quot;     The Omsk Ministry. On the 15th June Colonel Robertson transmitted [No. 546]the following message, sent from Omsk by Sir Bernard Pares :      Admiral Kolchak confirmed his previous statements that he was only a temporaryadministrator to reunite Russia and prepare the constituent assembly ; that the militaryregime could only be temporary, during the  civil  war ; and that  there  could be  noreturn to the  old regime.  Pro-British and  pro-German tendencies would,  he  said,fight more  nakedly  later on ; he  stood  for  England,  which  had given enormousunselfish help.     The premier, Mr. Vologodsky, said that he and the government were  against theindiscriminate action of some subordinates to the  prejudice of civil liberty.   GeneralRinoff should have been  dismissed  for his  treatment of the zemstvos  and the towncouncils.     Mr. Soukin,  foreign minister,  said that  the  government relied on  England andFrance; hoping also that they would secure the co-operation of America.   He stronglycondemned the German and Japanese  views  of some reactionary  officers.   The recentSiberian congress of the Cadet party had also fully discussed and condemned this view.The dissentients would be excluded from the party.  There were fourteen party groupsforming a strong block sharing  the views of the Cadets.   Its jDresident (four groupsundecypherable)  was being rapidly  cleared of  undesirable revolutionary elements.Siberia  was  hopelessly short of public workers:  all  agreed that  foreign help wasindispensable.   I  proposed  to   prepare  English  specialists  for  service  in  thegovernment, in  the  zemstvos, &amp;c.   Admiral Kolchak,  the  premier, the  minister  forforeign  affairs,  and  the  minister  of  finance, expressed the  strongest desire  forsuch help.   A special conference of ministries and  public organizations  would shortlydiscuss  details.   Probably   the   ex-minister -of  education, the  eminent  professorSapojnikoff, would be sent  to England in October.  The  minister for  foreign affairs asked whether Rmssian school-books could be printed in England.     Admiral Kolchak and British Policy. On the 21st June Lord Curzon  telegraphed[No. 430] to Sir Charles Eliot, saying that it was of supreme importance that admiral kolchak should fully appreciate the fact that every act of himself or General Lenikin, orof the representatives of either of them, tending to confirm  the  view, held  by  some inthis country,  that the  allies were supporting the extreme reactionary  elements inRussia, would be  used as an argument  to prevent his  majesty&apos;s government fromadhering to its present  attitude.    That government was  satisfied  that  the admiralstood for principles in accordance with traditional British policy, and that therefore  inspite of criticism, it was-justified in supporting him : but his entourage should  be madeto realize the momentous issues at stake, and that the continued assistance of GreatBritain was involved.     The Don  Cossacks. The following communiques have been issued  by  the WarOffice:-   ..     (1.) On the 6th April a rising broke out  amongst the Don Cossacks in the areaPopoff-Beryaznyagi-Ust Khoperskaya-Gorbatoff, roughly 120 miles to the north-east ofLugansk (in the Donets  coal region).  These  Cossacks  had  originally been fighting inthe ranks of the volunteer army,  but in February they went  over to the Bolsheviks.After a few months under the Bolshevik  rule they  decided  to throw off the Bolshevikyoke and attempt to rejoin General Denikin.     The first definite news of this rising was received at the beginning of May from anairman who was sent over to General Denikin by the commander  of the insurgents.He  gave  their  numbers as  five  divisions,  each  4,000  strong,  and one  independentbrigade, 2,500 strong, composed two-thirds of cavalry and one-third of infantry, armed with 15,000 rifles, 14 field guns, and one howitzer.   He  stated that they were short ofammunition, money, medical stores, and had very few officers.     However, their morale was excellent,  and  so  far  they had  resisted  all  efforts tothe Bolshevik troops, whose  morale was bad,  to  suppress  them, and had furthermorecut the Bolshevik lines of communication in that area.  The Bolsheviks in attempting to deal with the rebellion were committing their usual atrocities.     There seems little doubt now that General Denikihs  intention to join up with  the insurgents has been  accomplished.   His offensive  in this   area has, according to news
received in the Bolshevik wireless, brought  his  troops to the hue Ust-Medvieditskaya,ou the Don river (lul miles N.W. of Tsaritsyn),  to  a point 26 miles cast of Kalach(118 miles S.E.  by S. of Voronezh),  and  thence to Gartmashovka station,  on  theRostoif--Voronezh railway (50 miles N.N.W. of Miilerovskya).   This encloses the whole area of the rising.     This  reinforcement of 22,500 men will be a welcome addition to General Denikin&apos;forces.     (2.) The advance of the volunteer forces  continues with  great  success along thewhole front from the Caspian sea to the sea  of Azov.     In the direction  of Astrakhan  the  Bolshevik detachments are  offering  littleresistance, though  the  condition of  the  country  entails  slow  progress.    TowardsTsaritsyn the volunteer forces have inflicted  a severe defeat on  the 10th Bolshevikarmy, which has lost 75 per cent, of its effectives.     To the north-west, in the  area of the Middle Don, the Bolshevik 14th. and 23rddivisions suffered heavy losses  and dispersed into small groups, some  of which were dealt with by the local inhabitants.  The 16th division has also  received a severe knock.Contact has been obtained with the  Don Cossacks, who rose against the Bolsheviks,thus cutting the Bolshevik 9th army in two, and giving General Denikin a reinforcement of 22,500  men.     In the Donets basin,  with the assistance of tanks, progress has been made towardsKbarkoff, and the Bolshevik I 3th army is in  full  retreat.   The whole of the  valuablecoal and  iron fields have been  captured.  [A  Bolshevik report shows  that fightingis  taking place  24  miles  from Kharkoff, which is the  sixth city of Russia, witha population of over 250,000 people.]     Farther  south the  volunteer forces are advancing towards   Ekaterinoslav, and owing to the threat to their communications the  Bolsheviks are reported to be evacuatingthe Crimea.     The  casualties of the volunteer army have been slight, and  the army has been well received by the inhabitants of the liberated territories.   Railways in the  Upper Donetsare in bad condition, but over 200 engines are in working condition  and large quantitiesof rolling-stock have been captured.     The line now reached by the volunteer troops runs roughly  from Olenicheva on  the caspian  sea, 69 miles south-west  of Astrakhan 5  miles south  of Tsaritsyn Lipkistation, 71 miles north-north-west of Tsaritsyn north of Ust Medvyeditsk on the Donriver-Kalatch  and Bogutchar in  the Middle  Con province Valuiki, 84 miles east ofKharkoff Volchansk, 38 miles north-east  of Kharkotf Pavlograd, 39  miles  east  ofEkaterinoslav the sea coast,  15 miles west of Berdiansk.     Since the beginning of his offensive General Denikin has gained nearly 90,000 square miles of territory.  His total captures up to the beginning of June are 32,000 prisoners,348  guns, 550  machine-guns, and  11  armoured trains,  besides  an  enormous amount ofwar material, including 50,000 rifles and over  1,200 transport wagons.                                    POLAND.     Declaration of a congress of Polish Jews.-The  following was published  in  &quot; the morning Post &quot; of the  21st June :      The congress of the  Polish  Jews, consisting  of  representatives of the majority ofthe Jewish population in Poland,  has just  published the following  declaration withregard to the clause in the peace treaty concerning the Jews in Poland :      The  congress entirely  shares the  opinion  of the prime minister, Mr. Paderewski,that there is  not the  least danger  of any ethnical and religious  minorities being  lessprotected by the Polish state than by the guarantees of the league  of nations.     The  proposed  clause laid before  Poland by  the allied states, and  considered bythem as the realisation of the autonomy and cultural elevation of  the Jews, would in reality constitute an  attempt to create artificially  a Jewish  nation  against all  thenatural laws of historic evolution, which lead  the Jewish population to a  community ofculture with the surrounding nationality.     This  clause, if  put into force,  would result in the  Polish territories being coveredwith a network  of  schools teaching the  Yiddish  jargon, which would become for  theJewish population so many ramparts  preventing the afflux of  Jewish children to  thepublic  schools.     This  would result in:  (1) the creation of  distinct  Jewish sects  ruled by Jewishcommunes, which  would contain the  germ  of Jewish political  autonomy;  (2)  the
creation of a new national body, distinct not  only as regards religion  but as regardslanguage, culture,  tendencies, and  customs ;  (3) the  establishment  of a nucleus ofGerman  culture  in Poland, as the Yiddish jargon  is  merely a debased form of theGerman  language ; (4) the deepening of  economic contrasts, which will become stillmore pronounced if the sphere  in which the  majority  is engaged  in commerce should base its national existence on its political autonomy.       - ........     The congress believes  that only the common  compulsory education of children,without distinction of  religion, in  the Polish  public schools  is capable of establishinghealthy  relations,  knitting the  bonds of  brotherhood,  and facilitating the intimateunion  of the  Jewish  population with the national life  of  the  Polish culture.   Thisnaturally does not exclude the consideration of educational  necessities resulting  fromthe  difference  of religion  and customs&apos;,  but is, nevertheless,  an internal  domesticquestion of the Polish state.     The above considerations have determined the union of  Poles of the Jewish faithunreservedly to  reject the means proposed by the peace conference for the settlementof the  question of the culture  and education of the Jewish population in Poland.     Sir Percy Wyndham s report on the alleged pogroms. On the 18th June Sir PercyWyndham reported at length [Nos. 96, 97, 98, 99]  in  regard to the  alleged pogroms,He said  that there was undoubtedly  an ingrained antipathy to the Jews as a race, buthe thought that it could not be fairly said  that religious animosity was  the cause of theoutbreaks.  It should  be borne in mind that  there was a strong feeling  that the  Jewsworked with, the Germans, particularly in towns near the  frontier, and further thatthey were rnainly responsible for any [?  Bolshevik] tendencies  in  the country.  TheAmerican minister  agreed with him that the  reports  of these outbreaks, undoubtedlyvery serious,  did   not correspond  with  the facts and were  grossly exaggerated,particularly in the American press. .     In regard  to the Yilna  outbreak, the American minister had. just  returned fromthat place where he had made a searching inquiry in company with  the  director  forPoland of the Jewish joint distribution committee.   The events which  involved the lossof Jewish  lives took place on the day the  town  was captured and the  two  followingdays, before the establishment of civil authority.   Of the 64  Jews who  were killed, theJews themselves admitted that ten lost their lives fighting  in  the streets, whilst thePolish authorities asserted  that this  accounted  for the deaths of many more,  adding that 34 of their own soldiers were killed in the streets.   The remainder of the 84 wereexecuted for firing  from windows and roofs.  What  had happened  could not in  hisopinion be described as a pogrom against the  Jews.  They were, it is true,  executed ina more or  less summary manner, but the  disorders wdiich were the accompaniment ofthe  fierce fighting then taking place should riot be forgotten : nor should it be forgotten that Yilna was  a  place  of 150,000  inhabitants, of whom  some  64,000  were  Jews.About 1,000 were still under arrest, and they could be divided  into two classes, thoseagainst whom there was a strong presumption  of  guilt,  and those who were known.to be communists.     The Jews complained of the pillage of their shops, asserting  that  the loss ran intomillions: the Polish authorities denied this, and  there  seemed to  be  but  little  doubtthat the Jews had been guilty of exaggeration.     The machine guns, rifles, ammunition, and  bombs which had been found placedbeyond doubt the fact of firing having taken place from windows.   There was, too, but little doubt that an active hostile attitude, after the  arrival of the Polish troops, hadbeen maintained by a large number  of Jews,  who,  though members of  the Bolsbevikadministration, had not left with the Bolsbevik troops.     At Czestochowa, as had been already  reported, the main cause of the outbreakswas the  misery caused by high prices  and  lack of work, for both  of  which  the  Jewswere held responsible, as they held the trade of the place in their hands.   But, thoughall the casualties were Jews, he did not consider  that this either  could be considered asan oiganized pogrom against them.     At  Cracow,  according to  the press, there were demonstrations  against the Jews onthe  6th June, resulting in the death of a Christian  woman and  the serious woundingof 44 other persons, half of them  Jews;  whilst  on the  following  morning  ninesoldiers and two police officials were wounded.   It was said that  considerable quantitiesof arms had been found in Jewish houses, and numerous arrests had been made.     Mr. Paderewski on the pogroms. Reuters Paris agent reports the publication of  astatement  on the alleged pogroms made by Mr. Paderewski,  who said  that he and  the
                                    TURKEY.     Greeks and Turks. On the 19th June Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No. 1295] the following message sent from Smyrna by Mr. Morgan:      A French  officer who arrived here  from Menemen on the 18th June&apos;reports that the Greeks have murdered one.hundred Turks at that  place, the Moslem inhabitants of which are now panic-stricken.     Greeks  and  Italians. On  the 19th  June  Lord  Curzon  informed [No.  1030] Admiral Calthorpe that complaints had been received from the Italian  embassy to the effect that in numerous cases the Greeks at Smyrna had  ill-treated Italian subjects and Italian protected Moslems of the Dodecanese :  it was stated that Italian property had been damaged  to the extent of over, a million and a quarter lire.  A particular complaint was made in regard to Major Carossini,  the inspector of the Ottoman gendarmerie.     On the same  day Admiral Calthorpe reported [No.  1301] that he  had received  a telegram from  Commodore  Fitzmaurice, senior naval  allied officer at  Smyrna, telling him that he had been informed by the Greek high commissioner that Mr. Venizelos had ordered that the railway from Agasulk  to Aidin should be occupied ; but, Commodore Fitzmaurice added, the occupation by the Greeks of any portion of that line had already been protested against by the Italians.                                      SYRIA.     Emir Feisal  and the Mandate.- On the  12th  June.  General  Allenby reported [No.  E.A.. 2529]  that, he had received a message  from Emir  Feisal asking  him to ascertain whether the international commission was authorised to recommend the giving of  a mandate  to  the power desired by  the  majority  of  the  inhabitants.   It was only fair to Syria, he said, that she  should know what was  possible and what impossible, as  if,  lacking  this knowledge, they should  vote  for Great  Britain and that power be unable to accept  the mandate they would probably get a  power only desired by the minority.  Syrians knew the dangers of complete independence and preferred them to France : if it were made plain to them  that the league  would  not  allow  independence: and that England would not accept a mandate, they would ask for America.     Should Syria be kept in the dark, the only result would be that some Syrians would ask for Great Britain, some for France,  some, for America, and some for independence ; and the  commission might thereupon  report that as opinion was so  divided  France would be as acceptable as any other power, which, as General  Allenby himself would know, would be a complete  misunderstanding  of the situation.  He had been, told that the commission was only  lor show, and that the fate of the country had already been decided : though  he was  convinced  that  this was  incorrect,  he  asked for  a  clear pronouncement on the point.   He would like n is-quest ions to be answered not  only to himself personally, but also in as public a manner as might he possible.minister of the interior  had issued a warning  to  the  people of Poland  that  severeprmishment would  be awarded  to those guilty  of attempts against life and property,whether of Jews or of Christians ;  and that offences against one class would be punishedwith  the same severity  as those  against  the other.   Mr. Paderewski continued asfollows :     Unfortunately  the  frontiers  of Poland  have not  yet been settled,  hence theBolshevik  propaganda  finds  easy  access to the  more radical elements among thePolish Jews,  while  others  are greatly  influenced  by the methodical and  untiringactivity  of  the enemy.  In  some  parts of the country deplorable  incidents have occurred, chiefly owing to foreign provocation.   The reports of  these incidents aremonstrously exaggerated.   Certain  pogroms in  neighbouring countries have in  onesingle day made  fifty times  as  many Jewish victims as all the rioting and disordersin Poland during  the  last  eight  months.   However  insignificant,  comparativelyspeaking, are  the above-mentioned incidents  in Poland, justice has  been  applied inevery  case  or is   pending.   Conscious of  its   duty, true  to  its principles, and inaccordance with the  unanimous vote of the diet  concerning all  anti-Jewish excesses,the government of  Poland hereby gives the  most solemn  assurance  that it will doits  utmost  to prevent  or  severely punish  every   recurrence   of  such  regrettableincidents, in the hope that native as well as foreign Jews  may find it possible somewhatto modify their hitherto extremely hostile attitude  towards Poland and her people.
     In reply, General Allenby informed him  that  the British government would give the fullest weight to the advice of the  commission as to the wishes  of the  people in regard to the mandate or the future form of government;  but it had already expressed its unwillingness to accept a mandate for Syria.     Telegraphing again on the loth June  [No. E.A. 2536], General Allenby reported the receipt of another telegram from Emir Feisal.   The latter stated that he had noted the  intention of the British government  to give  full weight  to  the  commissioners advice, and its unwillingness to accept a mandate.   Syrians would unanimously: ask for Great Britain, for reasons he should  set before a conference of delegates from every part of Syria wdiich would be held shortly at Damascus.                                    ABABIA.     Ibn Rashid [E.R. CXXIV, p. 4]. On the  24th  June Lord Curzon  repeated [No. 769] to  General Allenby a telegraphing  am which had been sent to  the civil commissioner at Baghdad by the secretary of state for  India.   In this  Mr. Montagu said that the whole question of relations with Ibn Rashid had been carefully considered, and though his majesty&apos;s government  would be  altogether opposed to any attempt  to establish  a balance of  power among  the central Arabian chiefs, yet  it accepted  in  principle tbe proposition that it was desirable to enter into  relations with Ibn  Rashid to the extent of subsidizing him to respect our border and to  keep open the  pilgrimage route ; the reasons for this being that his influence extended to the  western limits  of Iraq, and that he controlled the pilgrim  route thence to  the holy places.  Mr. Montagu added that it was agreed that it would be  desirable that our relations with  him should be conducted  from Baghdad.  He asked, too, for  information  as  to the amount of thepayments which had been made to him  before the war by the Turks, as it was desirableto know this before fixing the subsidy.                                AFGHANISTAN.     The Amirs Reply to the Viceroy.-On  the  15th June the viceroy reported[No.  881 S]  the  receipt  of a  reply  from the Amir Amanulla.  The latter began his letter  in a  manner which  was studiously courteous and indicative of good feeling and made no further attempt to defend  his aggression ; though more  afghano he  gavewarning for warning, setting out as his assets the passion of his people for independence,the power of a call to jehad, tbe newly awakened world revolt against  &quot;oppression anddomination,&quot; and  his  power  of resistance in  spite  of  a frankly admitted lack oforganization.  Emphasizing the fact that, by his orders to his generals, he had alreadyattained the real  object  of the armistice,  he pointed out difficulties in the way of aliteral compliance with  the armistice  terms;  he.dwelt more  especially on the proviso that Afghan troops should be withdrawn to a distance of 20 miles from the British  lines,taking this to  mean the removal of tribes from their villages and camping grounds.   Heobjected also to the action of our aeroplanes which  so  bitterly excited  the  population,armed  to a man, that it might  be  impossible to control it.   He  waived his ownsuggestion for a meeting of delegates on the frontier and accepted Rawal Pindi whichhad been proposed  by  the government of India,  &quot; in order,&quot; he said,  &quot;to secure yourgood  pleasure and to safeguard the dignity  and  the honour of the illustrious Britishgovernment.&quot;   He  went  on  to say that if the viceroy would overlook the past therewould be a bright  future for both parties in  the establishment of friendly relationsbetween the two governments.     After communication with the India Office,  the viceroy replied to this letter on the22nd June informing,  the amir  that he  had misunderstood the first term of thearmistice [E.R.  CXXIV, p. 5];  all that  was demanded was that the  regular Afghantroops should be withdrawn to  a distance of  20 miles from the nearest  British  force,nothing had been said  in regard to the removal of villagers&apos;  and tribesmen  from  their homes.   In  fact the troops had been withdrawn except at one point  and he must ask the amir to complete the work.   There were  too  some Afghan troops on our side ofthe  frontier and so long as they  remained there  peace negotiations were  out  of thequestion.  Those troops must be withdrawn forthwith ; and  the amir must also  issue orders against  gatherings, in the vicinity of our troops,  of the tribesmen  referred toabove.  As  to the aeroplanes, the vicerojr said that he understood the amir&apos;s difficulties,
but no change could be made :  it was necessary for the security of the troops that theyshould reconnoitre.    The viceroy noticed  that the amir had  made  no allusion  to the fourth of thearmistice terms which required that the  Afghan  government should discourage thefrontier troops from carrying on active hostilities.  He assumed that what was necessaryhad been done : if nob, it must be done without delay, for it was out of  the  question that the tribes should,be left in a state of doubt and excitement  at a time when peacenegotiations were pending.    Finally he declared that no modification of the  armistice terms would be allowed by his majesty&apos;s government.o
