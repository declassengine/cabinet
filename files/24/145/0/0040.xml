On the 23rd  December Mr. Balfour instructed the high commissioner, through  Mr. Alston [No. 230], to communicate the  followingmessage to Admiral Koltchak if and when he considered it desirable :     On the occasion of the  assumption by your Excellency of administrative control  atOmsk, Flis  Majesty&apos;s Government desires to  express its warm sympathy with every effort to sustain a free Russian Government on the solid basis of public confidence.   Nothingshort  of this can restore Russia to her proper  position among the nations of the world,or enable her to take her full share in the work of civilization and progress.    On the following  day, however, Mr. Balfour telegraphed again  [No. 233], tellingSir Charles Eliot to hold up this message for the time being.    Semenoff. On  the 23rd December Mr. Alston  transmitted [No. 358] a message from  the high  commissioner (sent  from  Chita on the 18th  December)  reporting  thatSemenoff had asked him to arrange a reconciliation with Admiral Koltchak ;  Sir CharlesEliot  said that he would do his  best, but Semenoff  ought to make the  first  advances.Sir Charles also said that Semenoff admitted having  stopped cypher messages, but theline had not been cut, and there had been no fighting.    On the following  day Mr. Alston reported that on the 20th December  Semenoff-had been wounded at Chiliabinsk by a bomb which had been thrown in. the  theatre.    Attitude of the Japanese. In his  message  of  the 18th December [Mr. Alston&apos;sNo. 358] Sir Charles Eliot said that the Japanese general at Chita had  stated that  hehad advised Semenoff  to recognize  Admiral- Koltchak and make his peace with him;and, further, that he would  use force  to  prevent  the officers  of  either leader  fromfighting.   Sir   Charles  also said that  the Japanese were  everywhere   exceedinglycourteous, and were evidently anxious to create a good impression.    On the 24th December  Mr. Balfour telegraphed  [No. 1102]  to Sir. ConynghamGreene, pointing out that the Japanese  Government had  united with  the allies in  an effort to restore orderly government in Siberia, and that this effort had been considerablyopposed by Horvat and  Semenoff,  who, however, would have been  powerless but for
Japanese  support.  It was  admitted that  Semenoff was  entirely dependent  on theJapanese Government, and though General Otani was reported to have given him  strictinstructions,  Semenoff was  paralysing the  efforts of the Koltchak administration toestablish order.  His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that the Japanese Government wouldtake immediate steps to attain the object for which they had united with the allies ; andof these steps the most important seemed to be the suppression of the protection grantedto Horvat and Semenoff with the accompanying subsidies, and making  arrangementsfor the free use of the railway by Koltchak and the allies.   Sir  Conyngham  Greene^was instructed to speak to the foreign ministers in this sense.THE CAUCASUS.     Armenian Attack on  Moslems.  [E.R.  XCIX,  p.  2.] Sir  Percy  Cox reported[No. 1066] on the 20th December that a  number of  refugees from Nakchivan  and itsneighbourhood  had reached  Tabriz; and that the  legation in Teheran had receivedtelegrams complaining of Armenian attacks on Mahommedan  villages.  He added that,though doubtless there were exaggerations, the position was serious.    Two  days later he  transmitted [No. 1068] a  message from the British agent atZenjan, who  said that information had been received to the  effect that the  troubleappeared  to have  arisen  from the Armenian national  council  at  Erivan  havinginvited Armenian refugees to return to take possession of their property; the Moslemsobjected to Armenians holding any property.                                    TURKEY.     The Capitulations [E.R. XCIX, p. 3]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Lord  Derby onthe  17th December [No.   2815]  in  regard to  the proposed  re-establishment of thecapitulations reported  by  Admiral  Webb,  and  instructed  him to urge the  FrenchGovernment not to deal with the matter before the meeting of the peace conference.     Replying to this, on the 25th December [No.  1866],  Lord Derby said that theFrench Government had most strongly urged that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldreconsider the question :  it did not consider it possible that  the Turkish Governmentshould be allowed to think that the allied Powers were disposed to recognise a unilateralabrogation of the capitulations.   It agreed  that French subjects were in no danger ;but Rumanians, Greeks, and Serbians were in a different  position.  In  regard, more-over,  to commercial interests,  a  tacit recognition  of the abrogation would  deprivesubjects  of  the allied Powers of protection in the case  of wrongful proceedings inthe Ottoman tribunals, and would, in fact, permit the remaining partisans of Germanyto make allied companies and firms bankrupt.     Chamber of Deputies. Admiral Webb reported on the 22nd December [No. 224]that the chamber of deputies had been dissolved on the 21st by an imperial irade.                                    EGYPT.    Resignation of the Rushdi Cabinet. On the 23rd December Mr. Balfour telegraphedto Sir Reginald Wingate [No. 1558] in  regard to  the  resignation of Rushdi Pasha[E.R. XCYIII, p. 4].  Sir Reginald was authorised to advise the Sultan to accept the resig-nation of the cabinet.   He was further instructed to  take such measures as should benecessary to prevent the spread of any seditious agitation.   Mr. Balfour  added that  alittle delay and time for reflection might bring the native authorities to a more  reason-able frame of mind; so no undue haste need be shown in solving the ministerial crisis.                                  ABYSSINIA.     The Jibuti Arms Traffic. Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to Lord Derby on  the  22ndDecember [No. 2869] informing  him that his Majesty&apos;s chargd d&apos;affaires at Adis Abebahad  reported that M.  Michel had bought  3 machine  guns, 13 rifles,  and  a  case ofcartridges lying at Jibuti, which he intended to import and present  to the Regent.Lord Derby was therefore instructed to ask  the  French Government (in the event ofthe  report being well-founded) to  give instructions that  the arms  should not be imported from Jibuti, in  accordance with the general assurance which  it had given.[E.R. XCVIII, p. 5.]
SYRIA.     Turkish Intrigues. On the 22nd December General Clayton transmitted [No. 247]:a message [No. 28] from Sir  Mark  Sykes, who said that he feared that mischief wasbrewing in Aleppo.  The Arabs were being pushed  on by Turkish agents to demand the Adanayilayet; and these agents were further suggesting an alliance between thetwo statesMfoslem and independent.   The Arab officers in Adana were being subjectedt^similar influences.  There was,  Sir Mark added, a considerable likelihood of this&quot;Turkish policy being successful unless  steps were taken to counter it.     The Armenians in Aihtab. On  the  19th December General Clayton  reported[No. 240] that Sir Mark Sykes had visited  Aintab [about 80 miles north of Aleppo],where formerly there  had been an Armenian  population of from 20,000  to 30,000,though  at present there were  only some  5,000 of them.   The C.U.P. agents  wereactively inciting the Turkish population against the Armenian ; and the Turks were inpossession of some 6,000 rifles.  The houses of absent Armenians had been systematicallydestroyed by the Turks.  In  a  later telegram [No.  248] General Clayton  said  that sir Mark Sykes had also reported that some of the  churches had been desecrated, altarsand ornaments being destroyed and the tombs  rifled;  this done, the churches had been used as latrines.   There had, Sir Mark said, been no improvement since the armistice.                                   PALESTINE.     Relief of the Poor at  Haifa. General Clayton reported  on the 20th  December[No. 244] that it had been  decided by the heads of the various denominations at Haifa to start  a fund for the  relief of  the poor,  on  the  understanding that  it should  be administered without regard to nationality  or creed.     Arab Propaganda. In his telegram of the 20th December,  General Clayton also reported that Arab propaganda  was on the increase, and that information had beenreceived in regard to two Arab emissaries who  were said be  be  distributing cyphers invarious  towns.                                     ARABIA.     Ibn Saud and the Ikhwan [E.R. XCIX, p.  4]. Sir Reginald Wingate reported onthe 19th December  [No. 1909]  that Mr.  Philby  shared  his opinion  as to  the undesirability, in present circumstances, of sending  Colonel Wilson to Nejd.     Medina. Sir Reginald  Wingate  reported on  the 23rd December [No. 1926] thatFakhri  had  received  the  Turkish  envoy,  but still refused to surrender, alleging thatthe armistice  condition providing  for  the retention of sufficient troops to maintainorder  applied to  Hejaz.   He suggested that  a letter  should be  sent  by the Sultanordering Fakhri to surrender without further discussion.  Meanwhile, a state  of warexisted in Hejaz as the time  stated in  the ultimatum had elapsed.                                     PERSIA.     The Cabinet. Sir Percy Cox reported on  the  19th December [No. 1060] that the cabinet  had  been considerably reinforced by the entry of [? Sipar] Salar as minister ofwar,  and Sarum-ed-Dowleh  as minister of finance ;  it was  probable that during the absence of the foreign  minister, who was going to  Europe  [E.R.  XCVIII,  p.  6], the latter (who was a  son of the late  Zil-se-Sultan) would  take  charge of the foreign office.     Telegraphing again [No. 1065] on the  following day he said that he had received a visit from  Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, Nusret-ed-Dowleh, and Akbar  Mirza,  who  had made urgent representations in regard to the situation.     They said that since  the prime ministeFs audience with the Shah [E.R. XCIX,  1 p.  5] ,the latter  had indeed been courteous and apparently cordial  with the cabinet, but he had made no  change in regard to his attitude to  their business.   The corn- position of the mission to Europe was opposed to public opinion. and the  interests of the  nation, and  it  did  not  stand  alone ;  less  important instances of interference occurred almost daily, and  daily  their position  grew  less supportable.  The cabinet had the choice between resignation and the loss  of its reputation.   Vossugh and  his friends felt sure of the support of a majority of the public.
     They thought that it would be better for the first protest to come from the public ;;if it came from the  British Government the Shah would turn it  to his advantage byproclaiming that we were trying to coerce him.  A public demonstration would certainly be made,  and then he, Sir Percy Cox, would, they said,  have  good grounds  for goingto the Shah to  warn him.          .                                         ..     The Cossack division was, they said, a difficulty.  Colonel StarosselskJI was&apos; more friendly, but if, acting on the Shah&apos;s orders,  he  turned out the  division vQNuppredlHademonstration,  there  must be some complications ;  but  they were confident&apos; that $Hiscould be met by the suggested warning to the Shah.     Should the policy of the British Government not admit of such a course they wereprepared to resign and quietly wait for another  opportunity  of coming to power; theycould not  stay under present conditions.     Sir Percy  Cox added that he  should deplore the resignation of the cabinet, and asked  whether  he might intimate  to  Colonel Starosselski that we  expected  him tosupport it and to comply with its reasonable demand to the utmost of his power.  he also  asked whether the cabinet  might be left  to  act  as it thought best in its  own interests;  he intervening as suggested should the  occasion arise.  In  this case thecabinet should be warned that should events not be what it expected it must not blameus for the  failure.     The Mission to  Europe. Sir  Percy Cox reported in his telegram of the 19thDecember [No.  1060]  that the cabinet had given  explicit  instructions to the membersof this mission, for whose selection it  was not  responsible, and that the latter hadprofessed that they realised that the only chance of producing any good effect was forthem to be very temperate in their representations.     New  Governor- of Ispahan.- In his  telegram of the  19th December  [No.  1060] sir percy Cox also reported that an agreement had been reached by which the Sirdar Janghad become governor of Ispahan, with the acquiescence of both the Shah and the cabinet.The Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari had undertaken to give every help in the  suppression ofthe brigands who controlled the trade routes and in the restoration of order; and it hadbeen agreed that if these objects were not achieved within a  limited  period  the SirdarJang should be relieved of his appointment.     The Assyrian Refugees [E.B. LXXXVTII, p. 5]. Sir Percy  Cox reported on the22nd December [No. 1070] that the question of the  rehabilitation and future of thiscommunity (whose representative was appealing for the protection  of the allies) mightbe brought up at the allied conference at the instance of Dr. Judson or the Assyriannational council in America.     It was probable that as the winter advanced he,  Sir Percy Cox, might be obligedto ask for  funds to  relieve  their great distress;   and  he ventured to remind HisMajesty&apos;s  Government that they had special claims  to our sympathy and support, as their misfortunes were in part due to  our having been  obliged to leave  them  in thelurch after our Caucasian mission had encouraged them to arm themselves to  resist theTurks pending our arrival.o
