The following wireless message fromPetrograd to Paris was taken up on the 3rd August: -     In acknowledging the  receipt of your  radio  of or  about the 19th  July, which reached us from Paris only yesterday, we wish  to confirm that the soviet governmenthas no desire whatever, and is rather loath, to detain in Russia British prisoners of war or civilians longer than  it  is absolutely necessary  for safeguarding the interests  ofRussians within the British jurisdiction.  It is to that end that the soviet government proposed as a preliminary step to send to some  neutral country, preferably to Norway,a small commission of a representative character having  full power to  negotiate withthe British government the  exchange  of  their nationals, and to  settle all  questionsappertaining thereto.   It is most essential that the British government should guarantee the following conditions : firstly free passage for our [? Russian] representatives throughthe various intermediate countries on tire way from the front held by the soviet troops.[Intercepted message ends here.]     The Bolshevik Government and Germany. Telegraphing from Stockholm on the30th  July  [No.  1215] Mr.  Ramsay reported that, according to  the  &quot; Politiken,&quot;  atelegram from the [? Berlin] German press stated  that diplomatic relations with sovietRussia were to be  resumed very shortly.   The name  of the  diplomatic representative in Moscow had also been put forward.   Resumption of commercial relations was alsounder consideration.     The &quot; Berliner Tageblatt&quot; published a dementi from  an authoritative source, butthe Swedish telegraphic agency&apos;s correspondent believed that the question was receivingserious consideration.     Appeal by Admiral Kolchak.-According to the &quot; Morning Post &quot; of the 2nd Augusta message  was sent from Omsk on  the 28th  July informing the Russian  LiberatingCommittee that Admiral Kolchak had issued the  following proclamation to the peopleof Siberia :     Last spring our armies began their offensive on the Ural front.  Poorly equipped and  poorly armed, owing to  the  want  of war material  in Siberia, they  nevertheless
drove the Bolsheviks nearly to the Volga and the Viatka river.  Attracting  to them-selves the majority of the&apos; enemy forces, they enabled Denikhfs armies and  the Ural,Cossacks to rout the Bolsheviks.   With the loss of the south and south-east of  B/ussia,the soviet  power  has found itself short of bread, coal, and iron, and the people ofRussia,  ruined by the soviet government, is sentenced to a slow but  certain death.  Itis because to have bread, iron, and  coal would  be their salvation that the Bolshevikshave massed  all their forces to march on Siberia&apos;, obliging our troops to retreat under the pressure of numerically superior forces.    In  this hour full of trouble, when harassed by incessant combats  since the monthof March, they have fulfilled their duty to the country, and will  fulfil it to the end, Iaddress myself to the population liberated from the yoke of the Russian  commissiaries.We are carrying  on against the Bolsheviks a fight to the death which  cannot end inany agreement, as in this  conflict we are defending liberty against  tyranny, civilisationagainst barbarism.   In this conflict we have to do, not with  honourable  foes, but withbands of robbers led by the dregs of the population of the whole country.  The meansthey employ against us are infamous ; the innocent are martyred, and acts of violence and general pillage are  committed.  We cannot escape the conflict and its consequencesuntil the enemy is destroyed.     For you the only way out of this last and terrible fight is  to  conquer or to die.To be able to work together in  calm&apos; and order you must rally round the  army, surroundit with  your  care, lighten  its burden, and vigilantly guard it against all inward harm. -     Let every officer,  every  soldier, fighting  at the front, see  and  feel  the  affectionwhich   the people  bear towards him at  that moment when,  with  all  the  heroismcharacterising him, he is at grips with the enemy.    An army well clad and shod, contented, and reassured is security for your safety.     General Denikin&apos;s Army. The War Office issued the following communique&quot; on the1st August :     The volunteer  army  under General  Denikin has  scored  another great  success.According to the Bolshevik wireless, on the 28th July severe fighting was going on inthe vicinity of Poltava, and their communication with the city was  cut off.  general denikin has  now reported that the city has been taken, with large quantities of supplies and materials.    Poltava, according to the last census, has a population of 53,000  ; it is the capital of a government, and, prior to the war, was an important modern fortress and the seat of a bishopric.   It is a  railway junction  of some  importance, and- the commercialcentre of a great agricultural area producing horses, cattle, and cereals of all kinds, andis a large market  for flax, hemp, and tobacco.   A considerable amount of distilling isalso clone in the city.  Prior to the war, at the  Ilinskaya fair,  held  at Poltava, some30,000 to 40,000  people attended, and goods to the amoun t of three to four million francschanged hands.  There was a large Jewish population, and, prior  to the war, a largecolony of Germans.   The city was first founded in the 17th century, and is noteworthyas having been the scene of  Peter the Great&apos;s decisive victory over  Charles XIIin 1709.     Apart from,its  historic  interest, the latest gain  of General Denikin is of greatimportance, not only for military reasons, but also from a commercial and political pointof view, and the  loss of Poltava is  another serious  blow to  the already precariousBolshevik hold on Ukraina.                                  LITHUANIA.     Official  Letter to the  Members of the House of Commons. The  following document was published in  the &quot; Morning Post&quot; for the 2nd August, wherein it  was stated thatReuter&apos;s agency had been informed that it had been addressed to members of the houseof commons by  the  official  representatives  of Lithuania,  Esthonia, Latvia,  andUkraina :      Within the last few days a document signed by General  Denikin and addressedto General  Briggs has been  published, informing. the latter  of  the  aims which the armed  forces in southern  Russia have  in view, and which in particular amount to the &quot;reconstruction  of  a  powerful,  united, indivisible Russia,&quot; .and decentralisation bymeans  of wide regional  autonomy and  liberal self-government.  We  consider it our duty to draw your attention to the fact that  to realise his programme General Denikin,in addition  to fighting the Bolsheviks, will have to overcome  the determined will for independence of all the nationalities constituting  parts of the late Russian empire, but
now forming independent democratic states, separate from Russia, in accordance withthe wishes of their population.     No local autonomy  or  so-called liberal  self-government will  be acceptable to ourpeoples, notwithstanding their desire to live in neighbourly friendly relations with theRussian nation.   -They assert to General Denikin beforehand and to the  other generalsthat democratic programmes are  not  being carried out in the districts occupied bythem.  The aspirations  of our peoples  are clearly set  forth in the  memorandum  andenclosed declaration, which were handed by their representatives  to  the delegations atthe peace  conference.     At the same  time  we should  like  to express to  you  our  assurance  that thereconstruction of eastern Europe, as well  as a  successful campaign  against Bolshevikimperialism, depends solely  ou  the  immediate   international   recognition  of  theindependence of the states  represented by ns, in accordance with the great principle ofself-determination of  peoples, already accepted for the  peoples of central  Europe nowliberated  from  the German and Austrian  yoke.   Such a democratic solution of thequestion would be a pledge to general peace, and would compose the nations of the lateRussian empire.  We should also like  to point out that  such a  belt of independentnations, with a preponderating  population of yeomen, would be a safe  barrier against bolshevism  and against a probable Russian-German alliance  which has already beenmooted in influential Russian and. German quarters desirous of the reconstruction of a united Russia.     Our  independent nations will certainly appreciate the noble sympathy shown by you and your country to their cause.                                    TURKEY.ASIA MINOR.     Commission of Inquiry into the Smyrna Incidents. On the  29th July Mr. Balfourinformed  [No. 63] Admiral Calthorpe that the following terms of reference for the inter-allied commission of inquiry into the Smyrna incidents were  adopted by the council offive on the 25th July :      The inquiry of the commission should take as its point of departure the facts which accompanied and followed the occupation  by Greek troops of the regions of Smyrna,Aidin, Aivali, and the adjacent territories facts which have in particular been reportedin the complaint addressed by the shaykh-ul-Islam to the conference.     The  inquiry should bear on  all the facts  relating  to these events since the dateof the occupation up  to now.     The  commission should define the responsibilities and submit  its report as soon aspossible to the  supreme council of the allied and associated powers with  the conclusions which it thinks fit  to formulate.     Greek view of Situation in Asia Minor. On the  3rd  August  Admiral&apos; Calthorpereported [No. 1593] that the  Greek rear-admiral  in Constantinople communicated tohim a telegram which he, the rear-admiral, had sent to Mr. Venezelos, in which he gave a pessimistic account of the situation  throughout Asia Minor, and pointed  out thedanger that visits to  the Sea of Marmora (? and) the Black  Sea ports might only stir upthe Turks against Christians.     He reported that an army of at least 100,000  men would be  necessary  to repre-sthe Turks and to maintain  order; and  as he conceived that the allies were not in  aposition   to  furnish  such  a force,  he  suggested  that  it  should be  raised   fromamongst  the native  Greek and Armenian population, being  officered and commandedby the British.     Greeks and Turks.-- In telegrams sent on the  31st July,  2nd, 3rd, and 4th August[Nos. 1576, 1591, 1599,  and 1604], Admiral Calthorpe  transmitted messages sent fromSmyrna by Mr. Morgan, who reported various incidents  in the  struggle between the greeks and the Turks.   Near Alashehr he  said he heard that work had been broughtto  a standstill by Turks killing Christians on the one hand, and on the other the killingof Turks  by Greek irregular bands.  Before the Greeks left Aidin the Turkish quarterswere burnt and the Turks killed : when  the  latter recaptured the town there wasa cruel massacre of Christians.  In the  latter case the Greeks say that 1,500 were killed, and  in  the  former, according to the Turks, 2,000.: both numbers are probablyexaggerated.   Mr. Morgan added that he  understood that when  the  Greeks retookAidin no  Turkish civilians were murdered, because all,  save 100, had fled.  Mr. Morgan
had heard, too, that near Oushak Christians were being killed by Turkish  irregulars.Finally, in regard to the fighting at Papazli the Turks had been exasperated  by theburning of five Turkish villages and the slaughter of their inhabitants by the Greeks,whom they had in consequence attacked.                                 ARMENIA.    Situation on the Armenian-Turkish Frontier. On the 29th July Admiral Calthorpetelegraphed as follows :     The general officer commanding-in-chief informs me that the situation along the armenian-Turkish frontier is fast  becoming  exceedingly serious, and that  fighting is taking place near Nachtchevan and south of Olti.  .    He  states that the  Kurds, to  the number  of 10,000,  between  Bayazid andKarakiliffa are threatening to rise  against the Armenians;  the movement being, in hisopinion, doubtless engineered  by Turkish officers, and he thinks it would be advisable to press the Turkish government  to do all  in  its power  to check these movementsbefore they spread further.    I intend to do this, but in view of conditions already stated no great result can beanticipated.                                AFGHANISTAN.    Bolshevik Note to the Foreign Minister. A wireless message was  sent  out on the4th August by the Bolshevik government announcing that the people&apos;s commissary forforeign  affairs  had sent a note to the Afghan minister for foreign affairs containing thefollowing statement :                                                ,    From  the  first days of its accession  to power  the soviet government announced tothe whole world its desire not  only to recognise  the self-determination of all  nations,large  and small, but furthermore to render support to those nations which are engagedin a  struggle  for self-determination against the interference of powerful  imperialistgovernments.   The  soviet government cancelled  all secret  treaties concluded for theenslavement of small nationalities.  The soviet  government returned to Persia andother eastern peojdes all that was taken  from them by the Russian tsars, and  grantedgenerous autonomy to all Moslem nationalities voluntarily desiring to remain within thefederation  of the Russian socialist  soviet republic.  The soviet  government  has thegreatest sympathies for the Afghan peoples.    The bourgeoisie is  supporting with men and  material the  counter-revolution oftsarist generals who  are  bent upon destroying all the achievements of the  proletarianrevolution.  All  their attempts up  to now have been doomed to failure.   The successesof our troops in the East hold  out the  promise that we shall soon join forces with the siberian revolution.   All classes of the peasants have learned from experience that only under the soviet system can they preserve  themselves against the scourge of thedictatorship of military reaction.  Despite all difficulties we can safely saj&apos; that victorywill be ours, not  only in Russia,  but on an international scale.  We shall act  throughorganised and disciplined masses of workers, and our enemies will crumble down as hasbeen  the case  with Kolchak.
