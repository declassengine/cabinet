SIR MARK SYKES, BT., M.P.     On .the morning of Monday last the colleagues  of  Sir Mark Sykes were  shockedby  the news  of his sudden death in Paris on the previous evening from pneumonia,following influenza, after only four days&apos; illness.  This is not  the place to speak of his general public activities  or of his alluring personality ; it  must  suffice  to say thatno one who ever came info contact with him could resist his charm.  -.  But of his public life during the last four and a-half years, and of his  connexionwith this office, something more must be said.  Called up when the war broke out hespent the next few months in training the territorial battalion, he loved so well ;  but when the time came for it to take its place in the fighting line, Lord Kitchener deprivedhim of the honour  of leading it, as he  wanted  to  employ him  on special  duties, forwhich Sir Ma,rk had peculiar aptitude.   He was  sent, as an officer on the general staff,to Mesopotamia and to Russia.     Subsequently he v\as employed by the  Foreign Office in  important negotiations,and was twice sent on missions to the East : in April 1917 to  Egypt and Arabia,  andin the autumn of last year to Syria -and from Syria he only returned a few days before his  death.     In the summer of 1916 he was lent to the Committee of Imperial Defence as  aliaison, officer between the War Office, the Foreign Office, and. the India Office ;  and atthe  same  time  he  undertook the preparation  of a  new  series of the. &quot; ArabianReport,&apos;&apos;  having   already  edited  a  few  issues  of  the  original  Report  for  theAdmiralty.     When the War Cabinet Secretariat was  constituted, in. January 1917, Sir MarkSykes was appointed  an  assistant secretary, with special charge of the affairs of  theMiddle East.  The Cabinet  decided that two reports of  foreign  affairs should be issuedweekly, taking his &quot; Arabian Report &quot; as their model, and he was directed  to  prepare the &quot;Eastern Report,&quot; which  was to luve a more  extended scope  than the Arabian:About a year ago he was  transferred to the Foreign  Office as expert adviser in  theMiddle East,  but  he  still  continued  the  preparation of this  Report, so that  hisconnexion with the secretariat of the War Cabinet continued to the end.

                                    RUSSIA.    Shooting  of Bishops. The  &quot; Times&quot;  correspondent  reported from  Helsirigforson the  18th February that an official  Bolshevist statement  said that by  orders ofthe different extraordinary commissions during  the  month of January  eleven  arch-bishops of the Orthodox Church were shot, including the metropolitan of Kieff.    An Espionage Story. The &quot; Times &quot;correspondent further reported from Belsing-for s on  the 14th February, as follows :     The official newspaper, &quot; Severnaya Kommuna &quot; (&quot; Northern Commune &quot;), published in Petrograd, states that  at  the  end  of  January the  extraordinary  commission  forcombating counter-revolution  discovered a  new espionage organisation working in theinterests of England, in collaboration  with  several Bolshevist commissioners.  Therewere  arrested  140 men and  women,  including  17 English, and the  former ministerof finance, M. Pokrovski.  It  is alleged that this organisation was working m touchwith  high officers of the  general  staff and  the  ministry of marine,  the majority  ofwhom have already been  shot.  The British subjects arrested are now in the Krestyprison.     Another  Bolshevist announcement is  that on the 10th February,  owing to lack ofcoal, work was suspended in nearly all the large industrial establishments, including thePutiloff, Baltis, and Lessner  works,  making munitions.   There  are  85,000  workmenidle, who continue to receive full pay from national funds.BESSARABIA.     The  Conduct of. the  Rumanians. Mr. Bagge  reported on  the  12th  February[No.  58A] that he had received written  a communication from the archbishop  of Odessa,setting out  the following facts in  connexion with the Rumanian  occupation, and doing so in his capacity as representative of the  Orthodox Church in South Russia.     The archbishop stated that the population- had been driven to revolt by the harshtreatment of the Rumanians :  on the suppression of this revolt, those who had taken partin it had  retreated  to the other  side  of the Dniester, but the  Rumanians  had  takensavage reprisals on  the peaceful  inhabitants, many of whom  were killed whilst theirmovable property was pillaged and their villages were burnt; as many as could  do  sofled to  the north of the Dneister, and tnere were about 50,000 such refugees in hungary and Podolia.   He asked that, in these  circumstances, steps should  be  taken  to remove the  Rumanian troops from the Chotin district, substituting French or British.     Mr.  Bagge added that,  according to  information received  from all  sides,  theRumanians were behaving with, great  inhumanity, and he had no reason for thinking that there was any exaggeration in the archbishop&apos;s statement.OMSK GOVERNMENT.     Attitude  toivards  the  Jews. On  the  13th  February  Mr.  Alston transmitted[No.  176] a  telegram from the  consul at  Ekaterinburg,  who  reported  that  feeling against the  Jews was running  very  high ;  so  high  that pamphlets, which he had seen, had  been issued calling on  the people to wage  a holy war  against them.  Thereason for this was to be sought in  the part played by the Jews in Bolshevism.     The Semenoff Commission. Mr.  Alston reported  on the 12th February that  atelegram in  regard  to the Semenoff  Commission had  been  sent  from Omsk on  the31st  January by  Sir Charles  Eliot, who reported that an official request   to  attachofficers to the commission to be appointed for the investigation of General  Semenoff sproceedings  had been  made to him and the French high commissioner.  Sir Charlesadded  that  both of  them were  willing  to do  this;   but he  asked Mr.  Alston  toascertain whether the  Americans  and  the  Japanese  would do the same, and  if notwhether they objected to the  French and British commissioners sending officers.     Mr. Alston  replied that,  though  the  American  ambassador and  general were strongly of opinion  that the matter did not  concern us,  they had  no  objection  to  ourtaking our own line.  The Japanese commander-in-chief and agent adopted the sameattitude, the latter further saying that he  thought our representation on the commission was undesirable, as it would emphasize a difference of opinion.     Sir Charles Eliot subsequently reported that the Omsk Government did not press the matter.
ft.3     In .* a . telegram  sent  from  Washington on  the 13th  February  [No. 316]  Mr.&quot;Barclay reported that he had been  informed by the State Department that the decision-of-the United States Government  not to be represented on  the commission  was inconformity with its  attitude of impartiality between General Semenoff  and AdmiralKoltchak ; as to other Governments, it seemed no reason why they should not appoint representatives.                                    POLAND.     The Opening of the Diet. Colonel Wade reported on the 11th February [No. 7.9]that  the  Polish diet had been formally opened on the 10th&apos; February by  GeneralPilsudski, whose opening speech contained a cordial reference to the allies.   The onebright  spot,  he  said, in Polish  foreign  politics was  the  sympathy of the  allies and the constant tightening of Poland&apos;s relations with them.  He stated that Poland owed her independence to the destruction&quot;by the armies of the allies of &quot;her enemy Germany.&quot;He emphasized  the  necessity for  Poland having a strong  army, and said that thefirst task of the parliament would be to prepare bills regarding industry, unemployment,and agricultural reform.   During- the  sitting  a telegram was received  announcing theoccupation of Brest-Litovsk by Polish troops on the anniversary of the  German treatyof Brest and was read with enthusiasm.     Relations with Germany. On  the  17th February Mr. Balfour reported [No. 318]that  at a meeting of the representatives of the five powers that afternoon the despatchof  following telegram by Marshal Foch  to  the inter-allied commission at Warsawwas approved :      I send you  below the  text  of article 1 of the armistice  convention signed  on the16th  February.     The Germans must immediately desist from  all offensive operations against thePoles in the region of Posen or any other region.   [The line  of  demarcation is hereset out.]     The inter-allied commission at  Warsaw should at once inform the Polish govern-ment and command  of this convention, reminding them that all hostilities must ceaseon  the  Polish side  as on  the German.  The commission must make  sure that thisinjunction is  observed on both sides.     It  will settle on the spot the difficulties of detail  which cannot fail to  arise, the lineof demarcation fixed serving as the basis of its decision.     The German delegates have asked Marshal  fToch that rules may be  laid down forthe protection of 460,000 German subjects living in the territory occupied by Poles, for communication between this territory and rest of Germany, and for the  rolling-stock &quot;of railways [sic, cyphered).    Marshal Foch has been unable  to treat from  a  distance these questions of detailwhich can only be settled on the spot.   The allied and associated  governments  instruct the inter-albed commission at Warsaw to decide them. With this object the commission should establish  relations with the German government and the high command throughGeneral Dupont and Berlin.  -                                   RUMANIA.     Transylvania  and  the Banat.  On the 11th February  Lord Derby transmitted[No. 296] a telegram sent on the 5th February by the allied ministers at Bucharest.  -     They reported that a delegation of the Saxon population in Transylvania and theBanat had come to Bucharest to express its adherence to the  union with Rumania ; andthat this Saxon  population, which was in  the majority in those districts, declared thatit had no bond with Germany, from which it had been separated for 800 years.                                   TURKEY.    Ali  Ihsan [E.R.  No. CVII, p. 5].-On  the 12th February [No.  315]  admiral calthorpe reported that Ali Ihsan had  been removed from the command of the  sixtharray by  orders issued on the  10th  February.  The  name of his successor  was  being submitted by the Turkish Government for the approval of Admiral Calthorpe.
                                    MOEOCCO.                           ,&apos;     The  T a filet Rebels. The &quot; Times &quot;  correspondent  reported  from Tangier on the 14th February as follows:      News from the seat of rebellion in  the oasis  of Tatilet, situated at the extreme south-east of the Transatlas regions of Morocco, is eminently satisfactory.  A column of French protectorate troops, advancing from an easterly direction from Bu Denib, near the Algerian frontier, has  defeated the rebels and  driven them info the thick central palm-groves of  the  oasis, where  they  are hurriedly  fortifying their  villages.   The protectorate troops have  occupied an  important  conglomeration  of  villages  known as Ksur es Suk and other strategic  points.     Meanwhile, Fladj Thami Glaoui, who is basha of Marrakesh, by a difficult but very successful march over the snow peaks of  the Atlas  range, has advanced from the west v/ith a  force of irregular troops, now numbering 10,000.  This army has reached Ferkla,, the nearest oasis to Tafilet, on its western side, and  is already in  direct communication with the  force  from Bu Denib,  on the east.  The  rebels  now lie between  these two armies, with the desert  to  the south of them ; while a  third  army, consisting of a mobile  column  from  Meknas, bars their  escape to the north  by  the  valley of the Wad Ziz.                                &quot;     The  whole encircling movement has been most successfully carried out, and Glaoui&apos;s march through most difficult country is beyond all  praise.  He has once more given proofs, not only of his unswerving loyalty to France, but also  of his great  military capacity. The feat  of successfully marching so large a force  of  native irregular troops over the passes of  the Atlas range, nearly  8,000  feet above sea-level, in  mid-winter  and  deep snow,through  regions  totally unprovided with shelter or  food,  is no mean one, and deserving of every credit.     General Lyautey  himself is conducting this campaign from Bu Denib, where he will probably  remain another fortnight.     German Activity. The  &quot; Times&quot;  correspondent   telegraphing from Tangier on the 13th  February in regard to German activities in Morocco referred to a mysterious box which had been sent on the  25th January to  Abdul Melek by  the  German consul at  Tetuan, and then  went to  say that this box  had &quot;reached its destination.  It contained sufficient money for the rebel  leader  to  organise  once again an armed force with the intention of further  rebellion.   In the Wazan district the rebel Kassim ben Salalfs forces,  which  had dispersed,  have been  reorganised and are being well and regularly  paid from funds supplied by a German agent named Kuhnel, who is  living as  an  honoured  guest  in Raisuli&apos;s house.  Herr Kell,  Austrian consul at  Laraiche,. continues  in  constant  communication  with  Kuhnel   and  forwards  him funds and supplies.&quot;     He added that &quot;large secret German funds remained in Spain  at the time of the signing Of the  armistice,  as well  as  a considerable amount of British  gold standing to  the  credit of the Turkish  O.U.B., and that  this  gold  was  also  being introduced. into Morocco for German-Turkish propaganda.&quot;                                      SYRIA.     Its Future Government. On the 13th February  Mr.  Balfour reported  [No. 291] that at  that day&apos;s meeting Dr. Bliss, president of  American  college at Beirut, had urged that  an  inter-allied or mixed commission should  immediately  be  sent to Syria to ascertain  what form of government the Syrians desired and under whose protection they wished  to be placed.   The commission  should, he  said, have ample powers and toe full support of the British and the French authorities  in:Syria.  He laid great stress on the fact that the  present  military  censorship  prevented  Syrians from expressing  their Opinions freely, but, on being questioned  by Mr. Balfour and Lord Milner, he admitted that the British censorship in Syria did not seek in particular to suppress expressions of pro-French  sympathies.  He declared  that blood might  be  shed  if  an  immediate opportunity were not afforded to  Syrians  for expressing their views.     Chekri Ganem, the president of the Syrian national  committee, then stated the case for Syria.   He pleaded for Syrian independence under the segisoi France, with  Damascus as  capital,  and bounded, -by  the  Taurus,  Sinai,  the  desert, and the Mediterranean; Palestine  being autonomous, but  joined to Syria  under  a federal system.  He strongly urged that Syria should not be given over to the Arabs,  and even declared that Syrians-would prefer Turkish rule to that of Hejaz.
