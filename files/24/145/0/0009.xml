APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXIX,                                    RUSSIA.    THERE are indications in  this report that the Bolshevik power is beginning towane.  The news of the spread of pogroms is disquieting.  The Germans  are not failing to take advantage of both these developments.                                  TURKESTAN.    The Turco-German efforts are to be noted.   The situation may grow serious.                                   BULGARIA    Chapik  Pashas remarks should be accepted with reserve.   The Bulgarians are notthe sort of people with whom the Germans would take great liberties.                                   PERSIA.    The Turco-Germans are evidently taking steps to get the Southern Kurds in hand.Our operations near Kirkuk have probably stimulated the enemy to take these steps.M. S.May 23, 1918.[898-96]

Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the  14th May [No. 178]that the allied military authorities had met that day and had agreed, in regard to thegeneral situation, that the overthrow of the Bolsheviks had become more probable sincethe recent happenings in Ukraina ; should this happen the efforts of German diplomacy,-&apos;already noticeable, would be  enhanced  and  would certainly  win  for Germany the sympathy of all opposed to Bolshevism.   The Government realised that the germans were inimical and that it would sooner or later be overthrown by them.   The majorityof the upper class were inclined to look favourably on pro-German policy.     Mr. Woodhouse  telegraphed from  Petrograd on the same  day [No. 188] that theadherents of the party in  power were rapidly being  lessened in  number :  the sailorswere assuming  a  threatening attitude  and  several important factories had passedresolutions against the Bolsheviks.   The  working  classes were  discontented mainly onaccount of the food trouble which was  becoming acute, but also because of  the closing of factories  which was due to the shortage of raw material and fuel.     The Black Sea Fleet-Mr. Lockhart  telegraphed on the 14th May [No. 179] that according to telegrams received from Admiral Sablin a considerable portion of the Black.Sea fleet had escaped, and had reached Novorossisk.   The admiral said that the return of the fleet had  been demanded by  the  Germans ;  but M. Trotsky  had ordered himperemptorily to destroy every  ship in case  of clanger  and meantime to  proceed toSukhum&apos;.     British Military  Missions. In reply  to a  telegram which  he had  received fromMr.  Lockhart suggesting  that,  in  order  to  secure  co-operation, one of the  officers.connected with the various British missions in Russia should be given senior rank which
would  put him if  necessary in a  position of authority  over  the others, Mr. Balfourtelegraphed on  the 19th  May that  authority over all the military missions  in  russia had been given to General Poole who had left for that country.    The Jews.- In his telegram of the 14th May, already referred to, Mr. Woodhousementioned that Jewish pogroms were spreading all over Russia, and that the organisationof them was  attributed  by  German  propagandists to American money, we, ourselves,doing nothing to hinder it.LITHUANIA.    Request  for  Recognition  of Independence. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed  on the18th May [No.  779] that a  letter for the Prime Minister and another for Mr. Balfourhad been entrusted to him by two delegates of the  Lithuanian Council of State;  the letters requested the recognition of the  independence of their country.   Thewdelegatessaid that it was recognised, that the  German recognition of independence was illusionary,a fact which had  been brought home by the way in which  the economic resources oftheir country had been exploited.   They had complained of the excesses of the german troops to Hindenburg and. Ludendorff, but, on the ground that Lithuania, by furnishingfoodstuffs and  raw material, was rendering great services to Germany, the latter  had refused to suppress the military administration.  The delegates recognised that, whilst the German occupation was  effective, the Allies could not recognise the independence ofLithuania, but  were anxious that  one  of their prominent  statesmen should publiclyreply  to  the  speech recently  made by  von  Payer in  the  Reichstag,  which  seemedto foreshadow; annexation by Germany, or, at least, compulsory colonisation.   If  such  astatesman should declare that the German recognition of independence was a dead letter,and that the  Entente could  not recognise the independence of Lithuania whilst  it  was occupied by Germany, it  would give the country the  moral force to resist the occupying power.SEBEKCA.    Prohibition of Cypher Telegrams.-Mr.  Wardrop telegraphed on  the 12th  May[No. 302] that, in  consequence of a letter from the Commissary for Foreign Affairs tohis American colleague announcing the prohibition of the use of cypher  telegrams byconsular  officers in Siberia, he had joined his colleagues of the United States, France,Japan, Italy, and Sweden in a formal collective protest on the ground that the prohibitionwas at variance not only with treaty obligations but with international law.   They had also requested- its  withdrawal.  On the 15th May  Mr. Wardrop  sent  some extracts from  the press, among  others one from the &quot; Znamenyatruda,&quot; to  the effect  that the ambassadors at Vologda had declared that the question should have been  raised bythe diplomatic corps;  not  by consuls, who had no right to take up questions  ofinternational  law.    A &quot; Provisional  Government.&quot; --Sir J. Jordan telegraphed from Pekin on the 18thMay [No. 433] that  a provisional government, whose primary intent  was the  mobility-zation of the  Cossacks against the Bolsheviks, had been set up in the country occupiedby Semenoff.   It was a triumvirate composed of  Semenoff himself, General Shilnikov,and Taskin, a member  of the- Constituent  Assembly, as representative of the  Trans-Baikal province.TURKESTAN.    German Intrigue. Mr. Wardrop  telegraphed on the 13th May [No. 303] that his -.&apos;American colleague  in  Moscow had received a letter  from Mr. Harris,. written  fromSamara.    In  this  letter Mr.  Harris referred  to  German  political and commercialactivities in  Turkestan.  The result was such a  diminution  of British  prestige that immediate action  seemed desirable.  German  prisoners and spies told the  nativesthat  Indians were  treated  unjustly  and  tyranically  by  the  British, and  that theBokharans should help Turkey to end British dominion over  Moslems.  The  germans had achieved their aim  in regard to  the  Moslems under  Russian rule, and it behovedthe British to make a strenuous effort to prevent similar results in their, territory, and tokeep  German political intrigues out of Persia, Afghanistan, and India.
                                  ROUMANIA.     The Treaty of Bucharest. On the 20th May  Lord Derby transmitted [No. 659] a telegram from the Allied Ministers at Jassy reporting that on  the  14th May they had. addressed a letter to the Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs in regard to the peace concluded with Germany..  In this letter they  said  that  though  their respective  Governments must be left to deal with the matter, they felt obliged to say at once that any stipula- tion of the treaty which was opposed to the rights and  interests of&quot; the  Powers they represented, or which violated the  principles which had compelled the Allies to take up arms must be regarded as non-existent.     On the same day  Lord Derby transmitted [No.  660] another telegram repeating that the Allied  Ministers had informed the Roumanian Government that their respective Governments  regarded the  clauses relating  to  the  navigation of  the Danube as non-existent, as  this  question  could only be  settled at the  general  peace  by the interested Powers.   The Treaty of Bucharest laid  down  that a new commission should control the Danube from Braila, such commission to  consist only of delegates from the riparian States and those bordering on the  European coast of the Black Sea.                                    GREECE.     German Propaganda.  Lord Granville telegraphed on the 15th May [No. 428] that he  had been informed by a general  officer that there was reason for thinking that German propaganda was at work in the army : quite recently  he believed money had arrived to help  it on.   Lord Granville  also mentioned some recent military troubles at Larissa, not of  much importance in themselves, as to  which he  said there was no doubt that they had been fostered by officers  who were enemy agents  and partisans of King Constantine; several of them had been punished.                               &apos;  BULGARIA.     German Control. Sir H.  Rumbold telegraphed on  the 17th May  [No. 773] that Chafik Pasha (the &quot; chef do cabinet&quot; of the Ex-Khedive), who was then in Berne, had stated that  Germans were found in all the  passport  offices and stations in Bulgaria ; a strict watch over everything which happened in the country was exercised  by them, and the Bulgarians  were under  German control  to a much greater  extent  than were the Turks.     Supply  of Food. Chafik Pasha also said that  provisions did not cost as much as in Turkey, and the food situation generally, though not  very good,  was better than in that country.     Agreement with Turkey. On the 9th May [telegram No. 731, received the 17th May] Sir  H. Rumbold  said  that he had been informed by the military attaches department that the Turkish  Legation in Berne had  been  informed of  an arrangement  between Bulgaria and Turkey,  arrived at  on  the 2nd May,  by which  the  former Power hadcedpd Karagatch  to the latter, and had agreed to a rectification of the frontier as far as Kouleli-Bourgas.                                   TURKEY.     Miscellaneous Notes. Sir H.  Rumbold telegraphed on the  17th  May [No. 772] that Dr. Parodi had had a conversation with  Chafik Pasha [see  under  Bulgaria], who had informed him that: (l) The price of provisions was still very high, the chief reasons for  which were  (a) cornering  by certain members  of the C.U.P., and  (b) speculation ; (2)  the Germans tried to intervene in   the  question of food control, but the  Turkish Government was  more  and more opposing  German interference  in internal administra- tion; (3) the Germans had, however, just threatened that Turkey  should not receive her share of foodstuffs  from Ukraina if General Ismail Hakki Pasha, the food controller, did  not  give  a  Iorma! guarantee in advance  that such food should be distributed equitably  to tlie whole population ;   (4)  food  conditions  were  much  better in the provinces, especially in that  of Smyrna, in which Rahmi Bey enjoyed almost sovereign power; (5) in that  vilayet (Smyrna)  French  and  British, subjects  were  permitted to- engage in commerce and during the war had made  much profit.       [898-96]           .                                            B  2
     Exchange  of Prisoners. - Sir  H.  Rumbold  also said that  Chafik  Pasha  had informed Dr. Parodi that the delay in ratifying  the  Berne agreement in regard to the exchange of prisoners was  largely due to Colonel Seiffi; he promised to write to Talaat at once urging on him the necessity for carrying out without delay the various provisions of the agreement.                                  CYRENAICA.     Say eel Idrisi  and the French  Government. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to Sir P. Wingate on the 15th May .[No. 654] saying that  a note had been received from the French Ambassador stating that the French Resident General at  Tunis was  pressing for a reopening of the  commercial and caravan movement  between Cyrenaica and the French possessions  in  central  Africa.   The Resident  thought it  advisable  that the French Minister at Cairo should take the opportunity of the overtures made to him by Sayed Idrisi  to  suggest to  the  latter the  possibility of his  intervening  with Mohammed-el-Abed,  and obtaining from him not only  the  exchange of the four French and  the three Italian prisoners, against the members of the Sunni family who were in the  hands of the French authorities at Chad,  but  also to  induce him  to adopt an attitude which would render easier the  task of the French command on the Tunisian frontier.     It appeared,  Mr. Balfour said, that Mohammed-el-Abed had much to complain of in  the Turkish command in - Tripolitania.  He  had  been completely evicted  from Fezzan, which  was his principal  domain  and  must feel that he would  be eventually greatly inferior  to the bands which the rebel Tripolitan  chiefs could, after the harvest, detach from the side of Fezzan.   The  Resident  therefore thought  that the  present would be a suitable moment to induce Mohammed-el-Abed to cease from employing  his lieutenants against France.   Such a result would  be most  desirable and would make it much easier for the French command to  maintain relative security in the Sahara.     The  French Government had enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to this suggestion, and they were making similar enquiries at  Rome.     Mr. Balfour asked Sir R. Wingate  to telegraph, his observations on this matter which he did on the 2 1st May [No. 839] saying that he  had had no  knowledge either of Idrisi haying approached the French Minister in Cairo or of any communication having passed  between them.  The matter appeared to  concern  Italy  chiefly and  he had nothing to add to what tie had already said on  the  subject.  ^                                  PALESTINE.     The Zionist Commission. General Clayton telegraph)ed on the 16th May that on the  8th May  the administrative council  and the Christian  and Moslem communal committee had been informally invited by the military governor of Jaffa to meet. Dr. Weizmann.   The  cadi made  a non-committal but sympathetic reply to Dr. Weizmann&apos;s exposition of Zionist aims ; he recpiested, however, that whenever there was a discussion of the  affairs of Palestine Christian and Moslem delegates should be consulted.                                    PERSIA     The Cabinet.-Sir C. Marling reported on the 18 th  May [No. 323]  that the fall of the cabinet seemed to be imminent;  two  of its members  had  already resigned.   In consequence of this he had seen Vossugh-ed-Dowleh and had found him ready to take office.   The  inclusion in his cabinet of Firuz  Mirza and Kawam-ed-Dowleh would, he said, be a guarantee for the carrying out  of the policy indicated in Sir C. Marling&apos;s note of the  11th March [E.R. LIX, pp.  3 and 4], though he would not be  able immediately to come to an agreement with  us on those lines;  the reason being that if he definitely committed Persia to the Entente Powers public opinion  would expect a quid pro quo of a nature to strike the popular imagination.   Sir C.  Marling suggested that immediately on  his, accession to office  Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  should be given the  moratorium ;  the outshare of the moratorium instalment which had not been  paid since May last this, however, being spread over a twelvemonth ;  and also a subsidy of 100,000 tomans.  The last of these  would be discontinued after  a  few months, and in return for it he would beasked  to send a circular to the various authorities  instructing them to adopt a friendlyattitude in regard to  British  interests, to  stop all  protests against the  action of our troops, and to give at once the same measure of recognition of the South Persian Rifles ashe gave when  last in  office.    The  moratorium  meant  30,000Z. a  month,  and the
monthly instalments of the outstanding amount another 15,0001., both at the exchange rate of 55.    Sir C. Marling said that he had pointed out to Vossugh-ed-Dowleh  that  his  line was precisely that of samsam--es-Sultaneh; but he had confidence in his ability to act Up tohis professions ; therefore he should urge the financial support asked for being given on the definite understanding, however, that it  was impossible to make any agreement bindingus to support any other  cabinet.    As a matter of fact there was, Sir C. Marling added, no  alternative.  He therefore asked for authority to furnish the amounts suggested on  the  proposed conditions whenthe occasion arose.    Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C.  Marling on the 22nd May [No.  282] sayingthat he was authorised  to furnish the  amounts  suggested  on the conditions and inthe circumstances  contemplated, as the  Eastern committee entirely shared Sir  C.Marling&apos;s view as to the desirability of the return to power of Vossugh-ed-Dowleh.    Fars. Sir  C. Marling transmitted  [No. 429] on the  20th May a telegram sent tohim  on the  previous day by  bhe consul  at  Shiraz.   The  consul, reported that  thegovernor-general had received  an intimation, in  writing,  from  Soulat  that  all  theSouth Persian tribes (and more  especially the Kashgais) would shed  the  last  drop oftheir blood in defence of their  rights  against foreigners, unless  they  received orders from the Government to  remain quiet  under the  attacks of foreign  troops, in whichterm they included the South Persian Rifles, and further that he could no longer boldin his tribes which he had hitherto clone in obedience to the  governor-general&apos;s orders.Soulat,  the consul added,  had telegraphed to  the  Persian Government, and also to themullah  at Shiraz, appealing to the  latters religious sense.   The consul thought thathe and the governor-general could bring  about dissension among  the  Kashgais incase of  a combination under Soulat, against  whom it might be possible  to raise various sections.    Azerbaijan. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed  on the  19th May [No. 424] that the consul  at Tabriz  had been  informed  by  the governor-general  of Azerbaijan  of  his desire, which was shared  by the  Democrats, to oppose  a Turkish  advance on  Tabriz.To be enabled to do this he wished to organise a force to be  armed and financed by us,and officered by the Russians.  The consul  intimated  that a necessary preliminary tothis would be a settlement of the Jelu question ;  and in  this jthe  governor  concurred.The  proposal,  Sir C.  Marling  said,  would  certainly   be  rejected  by  the  presentCabinet.     On the same day Sir C. Marling reported [No. 427] that the  Turks were said tohave  defeated some  Syrians  at Ushmu, and to be moving to  Salmas from  Khirgij.He also reported  (1)  that  they were arming the  Kurds  in Saojbulak;  and   (2)that a  small  body of  them  had  arrived at Maraud  for the purpose of purchasing-supplies.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                     RUSSIA.    Activities of the German Ambassador. Mr. Wardrop telegraphed on the 13th May[No. 304] that a  leading member of the Cadet  party had  called his attention to thepolitical  activities of Count Mirbach.  Soon after his arrival  in  Moscow  he madeovertures to the Cadets, who repulsed them: about a fortnight  ago he  renewed them,and  a meeting of the  Cadet  party was fixed  for the  12th  May to  consider his suggestions.  These  comprised  the  institution  of a  constitutional monarchy;  therestoration of a considerable part of the annexed  territory, allowing thereby free access to the Baltic ;  a revision of the Brest treaty, with  a  complete reversal of its  policy;.and the suppression of the Bolsheviks.THE CAUCASUS.    Reported Peace Negotiations. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 21st May [No. 433]:that the  arrival at Batoum of German and Turkish delegates for peace negotiations hadbeen reported from Enzeli on the 19th May.   The arrival of the Austrian and Bulgariandelegates was awaited.
                                    ARABIA.    Ibn Rashid. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the  21st  May [No.  848] in regard topthe flight  of  Ibn Rashid  from Medain Saleh.   He said that  the Hejaz authoritiessuggested the possibility of the British in  Mesopotamia being..approached  by him, asthey regarded his flight as a  preliminary to the severance of  his connexion  with the,,Turks.                                                                .o
