Bolshevik Policy. -Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 27th May [No. 231] that he hadI had a long conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Chicherin, who, though1 he  admitted that they could not be sure of them, had said that from  all outward signsI the Germans were prepared to co-operate loyally  with the Bolsheviks.   It had  been1 arranged that an economic  commission should meet in Moscow and a  financial  commis-I sion in Berlin.   The Germans had, too, offered to mediate between Russia and Finland ;I they suggested  as a basis for peace that Russia should  cede  the western part of theI Murman coast, whilst Finland should make over Fort Ino and  Raivoli to Russia, on theI condition that these places should not be fortified.  M.  Chicherin thought that these terms would be  accepted ;  and he pointed out  that  the Russian Government would beI freed from  any suspicion of co-operating with the  Allies if it agreed to the cession toI Finland  of  that part of the Murman  coast.   He admitted that, while endeavouring to1 receive all  possible commercial advantages from  Central Russia, Germany was now likely to concentrate its energies on the Caucasus.   As to the commercial side of theI question, he suggested that the Allies should co-operate with the Bolsheviks in opposingI the German trade campaign, and said that agents sent out by us to take up the  questionI would be w ell received.      Mr. Lockhart points out that all advantages would be in the  hands of the GermansI in  the event of  the commercial war, as they could  overthrow the  Bolsheviks when the  opposition  of the latter  became  too  violent; as  a matter of fact,  the power of the  Bolsheviks  decreased, and among tire masses discontent grew, day by  day.      The Cadet  Party. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed, on the 26th May, a resume of a long  conversation which he had had with a  leading  member of the  Cadet party.  This  person requested Mr.  Lockhart to inform  Mr. Balfour that the  rumours of intrigues  with the Germans  were gross exaggerations.   He said that a  proposal suggesting  a  change of policy had been  submitted  by the Petrograd  Cadets  some weeks ago.   The1 reason alleged for this was the futility of expecting anything from the Allies ;  but, at a  meeting which had been called in consequence of the Petrograd resolution, the Central  Committee&apos; had unanimously passed a resolution in  favour of complete accord  with the  Allies and  in  condemnation  of co-operation with  the Germans.  Rumours to the  effect that  the resolution was not unanimous and  that the Right wing  had not voted  were incorrect.   It was  equally untrue  that an  offer  of assistance had been received.[898-98]
from Count Mirbach ; though vague overtures, which  had  come to nothing, had beenmade by the Germans to individual Cadets  through third parties.   It was  true thatthere had been a diversity of opinion in regard to the attitude in the event of a german occupation of Petrograd; but a majority of  the  leaders had  been  antagonistic to theidea of taking part in any Government set up by German bayonets.     Martial Law in Moscow.   In his News  Summary  of the  30th  May Mr. Wardropquoted the &quot; Official Ga.zet.te &quot; to the  effect that  military law bad been  declared  in moscow  on account of the discovery of a  plot which  included  the Right SocialistRevolu tio n aries.     Compulsory Military Service. In  the  same  telegram  Mr. Wardrop  said thatM. Trotsky had been ordered bv the  Executive Committee to draw up  a plan  for compulsory military service within a week.CAUCASIA.     Capture of Sukhum. In the News Summary of the 30th  May, referred to above,Mr. Wardrop further said that the  troops  of the  Trans-Caucasian Government  had captured Sukhum -a place on the Black Sea.                                    SERBIA.     The Cabinet. Sir  C. de Graz telegraphed  from Corfu on  the  4th June [No. 68]that he had heard  that  the  question of  moving the seat  of government to Salonika,which  had  come  up again,  would  be discussed at the meeting between  the crown prince and the Ministers, who had left  for  Salonika that day.  The  Prime Ministerexpected to return to Corfu within a fortnight; after which he proposed to visit London,Paris, and Rome, should, that is, the settlement  of the crisis be in accordance with his views.                                   TURKEY.     Exchange of Prisoners of War. Sir H. Rumbold  telegraphed on the 25th May[No. 822] that the military attache&apos;s departtuent had learnt that Durri Bey, a personalfriend of Enver Pasha,  had been in Switzerland recently, and  that he was coming backearly next  month.  He said that  the Turkish  Government were  daily expectingassurances  from Germany that the vessels conveying prisoners of  war to and from the agreed port in Asia Minor should  have  a ,safe-conduct.     The military attached department;  had  also  learnt, from  another source, that thechief of the police  in Constantinople  bad  put forth,  a proclamation on the 14th instantordering wounded  prisoners of wTar and civilians,  who were desirous of being repatriated,to give notice at the nearest police station within twenty days.     Civilians (amongst whom  are  reckoned merchant seamen,  government officials,gendarmerie, police agents, and reserve officers) are eligible for exchange, provided thatthey are not (1) males within the ages of 17 and 50 ;  (2) awaiting trial;  (3) or servinga sentence.                                     PERSIA.     The Cabinet. On  the 2nd June,  Sir  C.  Marling  telegraphed  [No. 494]  thatSamsam-es-Sultaneh had resigned  on  the  31st May.   Sir C. Marling had  alreadytelegraphed on the 29th May that  four  of  the  ministers had  definitely resigned, butthat then samsam--es-Snltaneh would say nothing either in regard to  his own resignationor in regard to any idea of reconstruction.     Vossugh-ed-i)owieh was, Sir Charles said, a popular candidate for the premiership;though a good deal of pressure was being exercised  to secure the appointment of Allah-es-Sultaneh, and the ex-Sipabdar was offering the Shah a large  sum of  money to securehis own  appointment.   Vossugh-ed-Dowleh was  very much opposed  to  our making any payment to the Shah.   If he were not appointed, he and his friends  intended to procurethe closing of the  bazaars and to force the Shah&apos;s band : they were confident of success.     In regard to Vossugh-ed-Dowleh,  Sir C. Marling had telegraphed on the 30th May[No. 478] that he had been informed.by him that the keynote of his  policy would  be close relations with us.  As to the Turks, he would, he said, be willing so to act as to force a rupture of relations with them.   He confirmed the intelligence  that he  and his friends intended, by means of a demonstration, to force the Shah&apos;s hand.  They appearedto be quite confident of success, and to be  determined  to carry  on  the Government
without  over-much  regard for  the Shah.    The South Persian Rifles  were a greatstumbling-block.   Vossugh thought  the return  of  the  best  of the Swedes the only possible solution, though this would perforce  have to wait till after the  restoration  of order in South Persia.   If the way should be paved to an alliance with us, somethingwould be demanded by public  opinion ;  he thought that national vanity  would begratified by  some  territorial acquisition in Turkestan.   Sir  C. Marling  added that hethought Vossugh wanted something else.     On the 3rd June Mr. Balfour replied to this [No. 307] saying that, pending thereceipt  of  detailed instructions which  Avould  be sent shortly, Sir G. Marling  mightsupport Vossugh-ecl-Dowleh, so far as could be done  with  safety, as  Ids success seemedto be our best hope.     Situation in Fars [E.R. LXIX, p. 5 ; LXX, p. 4]. Sir 0. Marling on  the 29th Maytransmitted I No. 471] a message sent on the previous day by the  consul at  Shiraz  inregard to the murder of  Captain Will and Sergeant Comber.  The consul said that therewas  sure evidence of the guilt of the brother  of Fath-ul-Mulk ; and that  Fath-ul-Mulkhimself was to be arrested that day.  The guilty knowledge, too, of  his brother, theKargusar, with whom he had been living, was more  than probable.  That being so, the consul had informed the governor-s-eneral  that  for  the  future  his relations with theKargusar would be official ordy ;  it was  impossible to have any of a private character.The  consul added  that he was trying  to  obtain  possession of  the  remains of themurdered soldiers ; there was circumstantial evidence of the cutting up of the bodies andthat of  Captain Wills clog after the murder, and of all being mixed  up, letting &quot; dogslie together.&quot;     On the same day, Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 472] another message from the consul at  Shiraz, which, too, was  sent  on the 28th May.  In this he  said  that thecommander of the South  Persian  Rifles . had strongly urged their non-employment onaccount of  their doubtful loyalty.  Soulat was  said to  be full  of  fight and to  have returned to Khaneh  Khabiscene.  In the  event of disaster the  governor-general andKawam would, he said,  certainly join the enemy, but at present they appeared to haveno doubt as to their ability to hold the town.     Tabriz. In reply to the  telegram from the consul  at Shiraz transmitted by sir c. Marling on the 28th  May [E.R. LXX, p. f], Mr. Balfour telegraphed to the latter onthe 31st May [No.  301]  that the consul, with  a sufficient staff to  keep the  telegraphline  working, should remain  at  Tabriz as long as  possible,  though  the women  andchildren should leave at once.     But before the receipt of this message Sir C. Marling and the French Minister hadalready  authorised the British and  French  consuls  to accompany the  colony, as  they saw  no useful purpose in leaving them to be captured should the  Turks enter the town.This was reported in a telegram [No. 474] sent on the 29th May.     On the 1st June Sir 0. Marling telegraphed to the consul that he should tell hisdemocratic friends  that, if  the Governor-General gave him an official assurance that hewould use all the forces at  his disposal for iris protection,  he  was quite ready to stayand to induce the bank to do the same.     Shortage  of Food  at  Hamadan.--Oix the  31st May Sir C. Marling transmitted[No. 482] a message from the consul at  Hamadan saying that six shops  would nowsupply bread for some 10,000 necessitous persons, in  addition to a free meal for destitutechildren.  The consul said  that the funds  in  hand would provide for the subsidies till the middle of July.   As he thought that the political effect would repay the expenditure,he suggested that six more shops should be opened; this with the carrying on of thepresent work till the middle of August would require, at most, another 20,000Z.                                AFGHANISTAN.     General  Situation.-The Viceroy of India telegraphed on the 2nd June that theattitude of the Amir  continued  to  be  friendly;  but the  British agent  in Kabul had reported local excitement in that place in connection with the  arrival of German agentsfrom Turkey  and Bokhara,  together with distorted news from over the  Russian border.In another telegram sent on the following day, the Viceroy  said that  resentment andalarm had doubtless been caused by Bolshevik military activities on the frontier.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    POLAND.    A United and Independent Polish State. -At a meeting  held  at  Versailles on the3rd June,  1918,  the Prime  Ministers of the  three  allied countries, Great  Britain,France, and Italy, agreed to  the  following declaration : The  creation of a united and independent Polish State, with free access to the sea,  constitutes one of the: conditionsof a solid and just peace, and of the rule.of right in Europe.
