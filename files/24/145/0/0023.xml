APPRECIATION. OF.  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN   REPORT,  No. LXXXII1.                                     SIBERIA..    THE.  situation. in.  Vladivostock  and General.  Horvat&apos;s coup-de-main  are  bothdisquieting..  The future  depends.upon sufficient Japanese forces being sent to produce the necessary fait accompli..                                     TURKEY.    The information given to Dr. Parodi is most interesting..   It looks as if the changein Bulgaria is really having its logical- effect in Constantinople.   It  is therefore  mostimportant that we  should beware of intrigues which tend to encourage the idea of a compromise peace?with the Turkish Government.  Turkey stands to-day for Prussianismand Prussian ideals.  The only possible  settlement with Turkey is one upon a national basis after Turkey has been defeated.  The fate  of the  Kurdo-Armenian vilayets is atouchstone of our good faith.  These cannot and must not remain Turkish if the peacefuldevelopment of the non-Turkish, parts of the Ottoman Empire is to proceed in history,and if the power and lure of German or international finance is to be broken.   We canQO more do a deal with the Turks than we can with the Germans, but it may well  bethat the shortest road to real victory is by imposing  our peace terms upon a defeatedTurkey with the assistance of Bulgaria.  Then there  will be no  more  Berlin-Bagdad orBerlin-Cairo, and above  all  the frmv. door to  Russia, which is the Blaok Sea, will  be opened, and all hope for Germany in this direction at an end.    Of course, the  suggestion made to Dr. Parodi  that  the &quot;lurks have &quot; completelylost their interest&quot; in  Palestine and  Mesopotamia i.e in the Holy Places  of Islam,Christianity, and  Judaism is bunkum.   The proposed Turkish  retention of  Kurdo-A.rmenia  is the just way  by which they hope to get back after the war.  The essentialthing is to see that the principles for  which we say we are fighting are applied  equallyall round in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire as  well as in Central Europe.                                     ARABIA.    Sir   Reginald   Wingate-&apos;s  reply  to  Mr.  PhilbyTs amazingly  worded  telegram(No. 1264) is admirable, and sums up the situation quite clearly.  An &quot; order &quot; to king hussein  to  agree  to a boundary-even a provisional  boundary were such a thingpossible in Arabia which gave Khurma to Ibn Saud  would probably cost us  the Araballiance and all that the Sherifial movement means potentially as an essential part ofthe political settlement of the Near East at the end of the  war.

Reuter&apos;s  agenttelegraphed  the  following  proclamation  from  Archangel  on   the  22nd  August :MM. Lenin and Trotsky declare that the  British, French, and Americans  who  havedisembarked  at Archangel are brigands, and they  call upon&apos; the Russian proletariat tofight against them as enemies  of Russia, who  have  attacked her without declarationof war.  We declare to  all Russian citizens to whom  the welfare of Russia is dearthat this is not true.   The  British, French, and Americans who are at Archangel areallies of Russia.   They  were  invited  to make  a  descent  here  by  the legitimateGovernment   and  with  complete  and  unanimous&apos; agreement on the  part  of  thepopulation.     The  Government of  the  Northern  Region  is  composed  of members  of  theConstituent  Assembly elected  by  the whole population  of  the  governments of thenorthern  border  states.  It   comprises  also  representatives  of  the zemstvos andmunicipalities  elected by universal suffrage.  This Government had:been formed andhad overturned the  illegitimate Bolshevist Government  before  the descent of theallies.   It was formed on the  initiative of the  league for the regeneration of Russia,which reunites representatives  of all  the political parties, recognising  the ConstituentAssembly as  the only rightful Russian Government.     The  allies were then  called  to Russia  by  the only  legitimate  representativeauthority,  by the Government of the Northern  Region, for  the  purpose of military action in common, aiming&apos; at the expulsion of the Germans and the complete suppressionby force of arms of the Brest-Litovsk treaty  traitorously signed by the Bolshevists, butthey were called on the distinctly specified condition that  they must not mix themselvesup in the internal affairs of the government  of Russia.   Long live the  Constitutional.Assembly!   [The &quot;Morning Post,&quot; the&quot;26th August, 1918.]       [898-110]         &quot;                               &quot;                  B
     The  Government  of the  Northern  Region  and the  Bolshevik  Commissaries.-Mr.  Lindley telegraphed on the 17th August [No.  84] that the Russian Governmentof the North had notified  Moscow that  it was  holding the Bolshevik commissaries ashostages for the safety of the Russians who had  been carried away from Archangel bythe Bolsheviks.     The Bolsheviks and British Subjects in Russia. -On the  21st August the RussianGovernment sent the following wireless message to Mr. Lindley :      In reply to your wireless of the 12th August, we repeat that- we are quite ready to transmit through every channel at present available, and  also through your medium,Mr.  Lockhart&apos;s telegrams and the telegrams addressed to him, provided our telegraphic correspondence with Litvinoff should  also be  permitted in the  same way.  We willtransmit to Mr. Lockhart all the telegrams you wish  us  to transmit  to him and vice versa; at the same time we ask you to forward to Litvinoff our telegrams, and vice versa.Unfortunately Mr. Lockhart has destroyed his codes.  Our  proposal is that the diplo-matic and consular officials  of the Entente countries shall be allowed to leave Russia,provided that Citizen  Litvinoff and  all the Russians in  Great  Britain in an officialcapacity,  or having  official  duties,  are  allowed to leave  Great  Britain.  We  must point out that our agent at  Christiania, Citizen Baitler, while on  his way to Murmanskabout six weeks ago, was taken by  the British authorities from the ship on  which hewas, and is probably imprisoned in  Britain.   His liberation and  the right for  him toleave England must also be  one of the conditions.     The officers and soldiers of the French  military mission  will be  allowed to  leaveRussia, provided France permits Russian soldiers remaining  there  to go  back to russia by the best available route.     The British and French subjects interned in  Russia as  a  measure of precaution, inview of the military operations in fact carried on  by  the British and French forces, willbe liberated, arid no British  or French citizens will be interned, except  criminals, pro-vided that in Britain, in the region of Anglo-French occupation, and in the  region ofCzecho-Slovak, or Japanese, or American occupation, no acts of political repression are adopted against the  adherents to the  Soviet Power,  and that these  are  totallyunmolested.   British  citizens will  be  allowed  to leave  Prussia  in exchange for per-mission for Russian citizens to  leave Great  Britain, if they so desire, including  those now in the ranks of the British army.     Please kindly inform your Government of  our proposal, and please also be kindenough to transmit the sameto Citizen LitvinofF.     To the point concerning the permission for Russian soldiers to leave France, I mustadd that we  demand  the collaboration of the International  Red Cross, and of  three members of the Prussian E,ed Cross, who must be allowed to enter France to participate in this work.     In view of the destruction of Mr. Lockhart&apos;s codes, these proposals have alreadybeen forwarded by wireless,  through the medium  of  the Swedish Government, in ciphertelegrams of the Swedish consul-general.  But this is a somewhat lengthy process, andwe have  not yet received any  answer.   They  are  detailed  also in cipher telegramsaddressed to Citizen Litvinoff, which we will  send you with  the request that you shouldkindly forward them to their destination.SIBERIA.     French High  Commissioner.- Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to  Sir Charles Eliot at vladivostock on the  26th August [No. 7]  informing him  that the French Governmenthad  appointed M.  Regnault,  until recently French Ambassador at  Tokyo,  to be theFrench High Commissioner  in Siberia.     Coup-de-main by General Horvat. On the  25th August Mr. Hodgson transmitted[No. 86j a telegram from Mr. Alston who said that  General Pleshkoff, who had arrived from Harbin and had taken  over the command as military  commander  under GeneralHorvat, had informed  Colonel Tolstov  that he was relieved of his command.   ColonelTplstov&apos;s forces were  under the authority  of the zemstvo and  the municipality, but during the night of the 23rd August his officers  had decided  to place  themselves  underthe orders of General Pleshkoff.     Mr. Alston said that the  Siberian Government  had protested against this actioncomplaining  bitterly  of the lack of good faith  on the part of  General Horvat in soacting pending negotiations  : in accord with the zemstvo it had began to reorganise  forces
 under Colonel Tolstov.   The other side urged that what had been done was merely  an act of  military discipline consequent on  General Pleshkoff being of superior rank  adding that Colonel Tolstov was unpopular with  his subordinates.  General Pleshkoff himself professed to be outside politics, but Mr. Alston said that there was no doubt as to his having acted at the instigation of General Horvat.     The Siberian Government  expressed itself to be  still1 willing  to  continue, under certain conditions, the negotiations with General Horvat.     Strike at Vladivostock.-Mx. Hodgson telegraphed on  the 26th August [No.  128] that a general strike had been declared.   Printers, dock  labourers,  and a number of other trade  organisations had  struck : the sailors who  refused at first had joined in and there  was a danger of its spreading to the railway men.   The  movement was largely aided by terrorist propaganda and though it was half-hearted  was  gaining strength.   The agitation behind the strike was largely the result of enemy agency and as martial  law had not been proclaimed there was no  proper  machinery for dealing with it, and the position was out of  hand ; and  it  was, too, aggravated by the Horvat agitation.     Good Reception of the British  Proclamation [ER.  LXXX, p. 7]. On the  26th August Mr. Hodgson  telegraphed   [No.  129]  from Vladivostock that  the British proclamation had been posted  in the town and throughout the  district,  as well  as being published in the local newspapers.   The British attitude in regard to Russia had been  welcomed by  all save the Bolsheviks, and the impression created by the proclama- tion was generally favourable ; the promise of economic assistance was  particularly well received, as was the recognition  of the services rendered to the allied cause, in the  early part of the war, by Russia.   The American  and Japanese  declarations would also  be printed and distributed  with ours.     General Dietrichs&apos; Threat to the Bolsheviks.-On the 25th August Sir John Jordan transmitted [No.  718] a message from Mr. Alston at Vladivostock to the effect  that  he had been  informed by General Dietrichs  that he had intimated to the Bolshevik authorities, through the Swedish consul-general in Moscow, that should MM. Tjermak and  Maxam  be executed, he would  shoot every commissar he captured.  He then held forty-seven.                                    TURKEY.     The Sultan and Enver Pasha. Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed on the 21st August [No. 1 426] that there had been new arrivals in Switzerland from Constantinople, and that several of them had been seen by Dr. Parodi.   They told him that Enver Pasha was in close touch with Jemal Pasha, whilst for the purpose of upsetting him the Sultan was gradually forming a close alliance with Talaat.     The Turkish Attitude.-!)!. Parodi was also  told by  the  same  people  that the enthusiasm of the Turks  for  Pan-Turanism and for Germany was to  a  great  extent fictitious, whilst they had completely lost their interest in Palestine and Mesopotamia; the idea, however, of an Armenian  kingdom worried them.   They wished to emerge from the war with  the  Turkish empire purified from foreign elements, but intact.   As to the Armenians, they  would  gladly enlarge the Erivan  republic and facilitate the departure from it of Armenians  in any part of the Empire who wished to settle therein, and in addition would furnish  them with the means of establishing themselves.                                   PALESTINE.    Recruiting for King Hussein. General Clayton telegraphed on the 25th August [No. 45] that the results at Ramleh and Ludd had been disappointing ;  but at Khanyunis sixty recruits had been obtained, and at Jaffa over 300.    Neiv Joint Committee at  Jaffa. In the same telegram General Clayton said that a new Joint Committee  of Christians and Moslems had been formed at Jaffa.     The Church of the  Nativity at Bethlehem. - General Clayton also telegraphed  that, with the approval of the various religious  communities connected with the church  of the Nativity  in Bethlehem, the wall separating the choir from the nave in that church had been removed.       [898-110]                                                      B  2
                                     ARABIA.     Sherif Abdulla and Ibn Saud. On  the 22nd  August  Sir Reginald  Wingatetelegraphed [No. 1254] that he had received information from Baghdad that letters hadbeen written to  two Ateiba shaykhs by Sherif Abdulla, and forwarded by the shaykhsto Ibn  Saud, in regard to whom the letters were of an  unfriendly  character.   SherifAbdulla had proposed a concentration of tribesmen at a place a day&apos;s journey east  ofKhurma, Shudhub  Wells, where he  had undertaken to join them.   The letters weredated.13th July.   Sir Reginald Wingate  had reported the matter to King Hussein,requesting  him forthwith to. send Abdulla urgent instructions to  confine his energyto fighting the Turks, and Shakir similar instructions to refrain  from aggression  east of Khurma.     Ibn Saud and King Hussein. On  the 26th August Sir Reginald Wingate trans-mitted [No. 1264] the  following message from Mr. Philby, despatched by him on the8th August via Baghdad :      The correspondence ending with Government of India 848 S of  23rd July arrivedyesterday.   I cannot adequately express the sense of relief at the intervention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, as Abdulla&apos;s  letters had brought things to an acute stage, andIbn  Saud had  informed me  on the  previous evening that  if  Abdulla&apos;s operationdeveloped he should certainly take the field against him.   I sincerely trust  Abdullaand  Shakir will be peremptorily recalled to  show  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentinsist on equal observance of  its considered orders by both parties without favour.     Immediately on receipt of the  correspondence I wrote out a  translation  of  a combination of  both messages and  handed it to Ibn Saud at a  private interview,Having  read  it  through  he  expressed  himself gratified  at the intervention  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, cordially agreed with the sentiment expressed, declared  that hewould  loyally carry out his  part  of the programme, and  hoped that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would  guarantee the same for King Hussein.  I invited him to give mea written reply, which he did this  morning ; it covers much recent  history, expressescordial  agreement with  the sentiments of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, and leaves thesettlement  of all disputed  questions to the  discretion of the British  Government,whether now or hereafter, pending which either side must abstain from provoking theother by action.  As an earnest of  his sincere desire to carry out  the policy of theGovernment, he  has at my suggestion cancelled the orders prohibiting purchase  ofcamels for Abdulla, reported in my M. 139 of 1st  August.   I am sending a translation of my note and a copy of his reply by post.     On the assumption that  every effort would be made to stop Abdullah carrying out his designs on Khurma, valuable breathing time has been gained  by this intervention,and advantage should  be taken to define the position  and set up a provisional limit  tothe action of both parties.     Assuming any attempt at a permanent settlement to be out of the question duringthe  war, I suggest the following   arrangement  for  consideration.   The points  of friction  are :      1. Khurma.     2. Ataiba.     3.  Direct correspondence of the  King with the Nejd tribes and officials, and the           tone of  his and Abdulla&apos;s letters to Ibn Saud.     4.  Alleged oppression of Nejdis  residing in Hedjaz.     As regards 1 and  2, I suggest,  without any prejudice  whatever  to a final settle-ment,  that a  provisional  boundary  be drawn  from  Marrodepa  south of  [group undecypherable]s to Turaba.  roughly along the  line of Shaib Shaba, which  is  thenatural boundary between  Bequm and Subai;  all  west of this line, including both the places named, to be considered within the King&apos;s jurisdiction.   Khurma, of course, lieseast  of  the line.   It must further be agreed that neither party may cross the line  orinterfere for any reason whatever with the tribes&quot; or with individuals on the other side.I am convinced this is the only possible provisional boundary, and though it leaves theAtaiba of the Rakba plain to the King, I guarantee that Ibn  Saud will  accept it if aserious proposal be made.     Regarding 3, neither party to correspond on any official matter with  any tribe  or individual on the other side of the line or with each other  except through the Britishagent attached to it.
     As for  4, the matter might be  mentioned to the King, and specific complaints infuture should be forwarded through me to the British agent at Jeddah for settlement.     I trust that  the  necessity for  action on these lines will be recognised as the onlypossibility  of maintaining  peace during  the war,  as  both parties will  then know where they  stand.  In view of the  gratifying  effect here of the  intervention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in such matters, and though I anticipate murmurs by Ibn Saudagainst the details, I would  suggest that if the basis of the above proposal be approved,the arrangement should be communicated to both parties as final orders of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to be strictly adhered to as a provisional arrangement for the period of thewar.  I deprecate any further attempt at negotiations, which would only enhance friction,while the issue of  orders as proposed  would immensely strengthen my hands with ibn saud.   I regard the clause regarding correspondence as absolutely essential.     In regard to this, Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed  on the same day [No. 1265]saying :      I have not  seen  a  copy of the Government of India&apos;s telegram [No. 848 S] andconsequentl3r am not clear  to what Mr. Philby  refers in the second paragraph of  his telegram.  I should be. glad to be informed of the texts  of  the  official messages com-municated to Ibn Saud concerning his relations  with the King of Hedjaz.  I regard the  points in regard to friction quoted by Mr. Philby not as causes but effects of the traditional and  sectarian differences between  two principals.  Each would  doubtlesswelcome our direct intervention in  the quarrel  provided it was in his own favour  and effective.     But in  our attempts to hold the balance fair we should probably offend both parties,and  the coercion of either of them  would be difficult at the present juncture.     Since  making his proposals,  Mr.  Philby  will  have  learnt that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment has not restrained King Hussein from action against  his rebel emir atKhurma,  but have received firm assurances  that the  sherifial expedition will  notpenetrate eastwards.     I have taken  up  the  question  of the Abdulla correspondence with the King, andhave requested  him to prevent aggressive action by Abdulla or  his  subordinates, in contravention  of his own assurances to us.     In existing circumstances and  with our slight  knowledge  of tribal matters  andlocal geography I  do  not consider our  direct  intervention  in the boundary  question would lead  to any satisfactory  result.  The King would certainly  not  accept  theprovisional boundary line suggested.    I have already pointed out to the King that the tone of some of his and Abdulla&apos;s letters  to the eastern  shaykhs has been unfortunateand  ill-calculated to promote good relations.  I will now also urge the political desirabilityof his showing clemency to El Fadl and the members of his family at Mecca.     The situation is  complicated and. dangerous, but I  see  no practicable means  ofmitigating it other than by continuing representations to both parties that it is to their common and individual interests to prevent the outbreak of hostilities, and by trying to induce  them to correspond (either direct or through us) with a view to  discovering amodus mvendi.NEJD.     Munitions for Ibn Saud. Sir Reginald Wingate telegraphed on the  21st  August[No. 1249] asking  whether the furnishing of munitions to Ibn Saud could not be made conditional on his undertaking to restrain the activities of the &quot; akhwan &quot;  elements  in western Arabia,  and  in particular on  his  withholding  his  support from  the  anti-sherifial elements at Khurma.  Mr. Baifour telegraphed in reply, on the 24th  August[No. 1038],  that it had been agreed to give  Ibn Saud the smallest quantities of rifles and  ammunitions that  would suffice to keep him well disposed.  The India Office wasbeing requested to instruct Mr. Philby to endeavour to obtain the assurances suggestedby Sir Reginald  Wingate,  but the grant had not been made conditional  on their being given.                                     PERSIA.     The Present  Situation. Sir Charles Marling telegraphed on  the 22nd  August[No. 731] saying that, in addition to the question of the South Persia Rifles, there were two  others which demanded the immediate attention of the Cabinet  : (1)  the questionof arrears of salary, and (2) that of grain.  As to the former, government officials were several months  in arrears,  and owing  to the  late  famine their impoverishment  was particularly severe; and as  to the latter, prices were  still abnormally high, and, in
 order to regulate them in the capital during the winter, the Government had to secure considerable quantities.    We had, Sir Charles  Marling  said, to assist Vossugh-ed- Dowleh with both these matters, and he should be glad to be authorised  to inform him that for six months the amount payable on the moratorium would be  increased from 50,000 to 150,000 tomans, bringing, that is, the total monthly advance up to 350,000.     Vossugh-ed-Doivleh. In his telegram of the 22nd  August [No.  731], Sir Charles Marling said that he hardly anticipated, in present circumstances, Vossugh-ed-Dowleh venturing to translate his friendly feeling  into official action.  He was, however, doing what he could to help us by quiet unofficial services such as replacing  by trustworthy men the unfriendly officials appointed by recent Cabinets.     The Armenian Refugees  [E.R. LXXXII], p.  5].-On the 22nd August Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 439] to Sir Charles Marling authorising him  to spend the 20,000!. which had been granted  for famine  relief.  He added, however, that it was  desirable that the organisation of future relief should be entrusted to the  American-Persian relief commission.     Oil the following day he telegraphed [No. 1031] to  Sir Reginald Wingate, asking him to communicate the following- message  to  Dr.  Judson, of the  American-Persian committee immediately on his arrival in Egypt [he left London on the 16th August] :      In  view of the advance of the Turks in  Azerbaijan,  vast  numbers  of Jelus  or Assyrian Christians are  fleeing from Bijar in the direction of Hamadan.  While the military authorities are arranging for quarters  for  them  outside  the town,  there  are thousands of women and children and sick and wounded  who are entirely destitute and starving.  A relief  committee  is being  formed,  of which His  Majesty&apos;s  consul at Hamadan will be a member, to assist the destitute.  Information on  the 16th instant was to the effect that 40,000 Assyrian  refugees had already passed through Bijar toHamadan.   Some had been robbed of everything, and many had died of sickness andstarvation on the road.   A report from Bijar estimates the total number of refugees willbe 80,000, and a temporary hospital has been established  at that town, and  medical service and food  are being sent from Hamadan.  While I have authorised His Majesty&apos;s Minister  in Teheran to expend for relief of these destitute persons certain sums of money which had been granted for famine relief, it  is evident that these sums will be totally inadequate  for the  relief  in  question.   In view, therefore, of the  purposes of your commission, I hasten to bring the above facts to your notice, and  feel sure that your commission will  do its utmost to alleviate the suffering and destitution in question, asthe present juncture appears to afford just such an  opportunity as your organisation  is designed to meet.    I understand that the United States Minister at Teheran has telegraphed direct to those members of the American  relief commission  who are at present  in Bombay to hasten their arrival at Hamadan.    I am also informing the Archbishop of Canterbury,  whose missions for Nestorians have for many years past been interested in those districts.o
