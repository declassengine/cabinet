APPRECIATION. OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXV.                                     RUSSIA.    THE prophesied  fall of Bolshevism has not yet occurred, indeed it looks as if itwas rather the unpopularity of the Bolshevik leaders than Bolshevik  principles whichwere unpopular.   The success  of the Czecho-Slavs  continues.  The most  remarkableDoint about this movement is that it proves that a very small number of intelligent anddisciplined men can do pretty much as they please in Russia.                                   BULGARIA.    The new Bulgarian Governments manifesto  is quite non-committal.                                  PALESTINE.    There is nothing of consequence in the report under this heading.                                    ARABIA.    The account of Ibn Saud is not very encouraging.

Telegraphing on the .21st  June [No.  300,Mr.  Lockhart said that the  gravity of their position  was  fullycommissaries themselves, and the Bolshevik press did not disguise its feeling that theirrule was coming to an end.  There  had been  a considerable  change  of feeling amongthe workmen, and with approaching famine there was a  rapid spreading of discontent.In various  parts of the country  there had been  political  strikes ; at Tamboff therehad  been rioting in connection with the mobilisation order, and in Moscow itself therehad  been numerous arrests of workmen.   The weakening of the party in power hadunfortunately not been accompanied by  the strengthening  of any  other; the country was  in a state of physical and  mental chaos.     Fifth Congress of Soviets. A Russian wireless message sent out on the 26th Junestated  that  the following  information as to  the probable  programme of  the fifthcongress  of  Soviets  had been  given  by M.  Trotsky, the Commissioner  for War: Already the  following questions are put forward for  consideration :  organisation, food supply, and the creation of an army.   It must be  understood  throughout  Russia thatno change will occur in the Soviets&apos; policy as regards the food  supply.   The speculatorsand rich peasants must be disillusioned on this subject, and their hopes  of establishing a corn monopoly must be,crushed.  All local organisations must be forced to  carry  outstrictly the food policy of the Soviets,  and for this purpose it is necessary to have  acentralised administrative  system,  in  military  matters  it is necessary to pass fromimprovisation and diletantism, and to provide for the creation of a regular army  of  the council&apos;s, because regional ist amateurism has made a, fiasco  and  shown  entire  weakness.in the case of the Czech-Slovaks.
2    The Bourgeoisie and  the  Red  Army. The  Russian  Government  sent  out  thefollowing message by wireless on the 29th June:  Trotsky, People&apos;s Commissioner forWar,  after approval by Lenin, President of  the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners,has sent a report to the Peoples. Commissioners for Justice, Home Affairs, Finance, andLabour,  in relation to their respective departments.   This report  treats upon  thequestion of calling to arms  men belonging  to the  bourgeois  classes.   It  is insisted that general and obligatory military service is necessary and just, but nevertheless thatit is still dangerous to give weapons to these  classes, and that therefore  they  must  berequired to  carry out services in the rear.  When they have proved their fidelity to theinterests of the working  classes they will be transferred to combatant service.  Whenthe workmen  and  peasants are being  mobilised  corresponding  proportions of  thebourgeoisie  must also  be mobilised.   Those bourgeois families who will  not obey this measure must be punished with fines of from  3,000  to 100,000  roubles,  and the headof the family must be put  under preventive arrest.  All  parasitic elements  must  be registered,  that is, all those who have no useful  and indispensable work in the  CounciTsRepublic.   The elaboration of all measures necessary for  the realisation  of these  plansmust  be completed within  a week. &apos;    Attack on England. Telegraphing on the  25th  June  [No.  3.04, received  the 2ndJuly] Mr. Lockhart said that at a meeting of  the  Petrograd Soviet on the  22nd Junea most disgraceful public attack was made on  England.   In his report on the murder ofCommissary Volodarsky   Uritski had  declared  that  the  English  and  the  RightRevolutionaries were the inspirers thereof, whoever may have actually struck the blow.He said too that we  had  already  given 40,000,000 [? roubles] out of 265,000,000 wehad  promised  to the Right Revolutionary  Party  to crush the power of the Soviets.His report  obviously  had for  its sole object the stirring  up  of hate against  us ; itwas full of false  and  base accusations.  Mr.  Lockhart said that he  had addressed  astiff  letter,  asking for explanations,  to M.  Chicherin,  and  if the latter  did  notcommunicate it to the press he should do so himself; he was to  see M. chicherin that afternoon.    Anglo-Russian  Military   Service   Agreement. Mr.   Balfour   telegraphed   toMr.   Lockhart on  the  27th  June  [No.  212]  instructing  him  to  reply to  theRussian note -on this subject by pointing  out that  the terms  of the convention hadbeen  strictly  adhered to,  that  Russians had been given a choice between returning to their own  country and  remaining here,  with  the full  knowledge that if theyshould  elect  so  to  remain  they   would become liable for military service in  theBritish  army.   Those  who had  stayed  here  had done  so  deliberately,  but they hadbeen  shown the utmost consideration, having  been called upon  to serve  only  in labourunits or  auxiliary services  unless  they themselves should have  elected to  serve ascombatants.  In regard to the historv of the convention Mr. Lockhart was instructedto call the attention of the Russian Government to  the fact that the agreement hadbeen  approved by the  most important elements of the  Russian people ;  and to informit that there had never been  any question of handing over Russians residing here  to theImperial Government, and  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  utterly repudiated thesuggestion of  its having been influenced by the representations  of the former RussianGovernment in regard to the resumption of the  recruiting of  Prussians.   So  far  fromthis being the case, those representatives had  not  even been consulted.    The Kief Negotiations. The Russian Government sent out the  following wireless message on the 26th June: Rakovsky. president of the Russian delegation, stated thatthe German high command had agreed to form  mixed commissions for the settlement of incidents occurring along the boundary line.  At  the plenary session of the 22nd June,after  some amendments,  the  Russian  proposal, concerning the  frontiers  had  beenaccepted.   Both  parties agreed to a  referendum, properly organised and free, among the populations of the disputed regions.   The referendum would be carried  out under thecontrol  of  mixed  commissions,  after  the  ratification of the peace  treaty, and  afterthe armies  of both  sides  had retired irom  these regions.  And on the  27th  June thefollowing:  The real peace  negotiations began within  the  last few days when thequestions concerning the frontiers were discussed.  These questions have occupied theattention  of   the   plenary  sessions and  four  sessions of the  political commission.The plenary sessions  discussed  the principles upon which  the frontiers  are   to  bedetermined.   The  political commission  dealt  with  the matter  with  maps  in front ofthem.  The suggested frontiers  on  the maps as proposed  by the Ukrainan politicalcommission included five White Russian districts  of the province of Minsk, the whole
of the province of Chernigov, two districts of the province of Orel, three-quarters of theprovince of Kursk, nearly the  half  of the province  of &quot;Voronezh, the whole of theTaganrog,  and part  of the  &quot;Rostov district (with the town of Rostov), circumscribedportions of the Don region, and a part of the region of Kuban.     The frontiers between Ukraina and the  Crimea were not shown on these maps,because the Ukrainans declare  that  Russia has already lost her rights  of sovereignty over the peninsula of the Crimea.     The Russian proposals, as indicated on  their maps, included the three northerndistricts of the province of Volhynia, a part of the district of Radomysl in the province.of Kiev, the four northern districts of the province of Chernigov, and  then the frontierfollowed the administrative  frontier  between  the provinces of Kursk and  Veronezh,.passed through  the  eastern  districts of  the province of Kharkov and Ekaterincslav,along the  seventh  parallel.  The Russian  delegation added that  it would  defend itsproject  only in  the cases where the populations concerned expressed themselves inagreement  with  it, and that .... the Ukrainan delegation only at the fourth sessionof the political  commission agreed  to  submit a fresh project  in accordance with theethnographical  frontiers,  with  the exception of the  four districts of the province ofChernigov, which are necessary for Ukraina for other reasons.   But  this new project was  also not in  accordance with  the ethnographical frontiers, because the  Ukrainansstill  asked for a  greater part of White Russia as far as to the north of Pripet, affirmingthat the populations there were almost Ukrainan.     Polish War Refugees.-The Russian Government sent out the following wireless message on the 25th June :  The Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners must leave tothe German authorities the choice of persons or bodies entrusted  to  negotiate with it,and  in  the present case  the German Government has appointed Lednicki to negotiateconcerning  the  return  of the  Polish war refugees.   The Council of the people&apos;s  Com-missioners  agree to  enter into  the negotiations with Lednicki,  but draws attention tothe  fact that the only subject of these negotiations will be the return of  Polish warrefugees, and that the business can only be opened after Count Mirbach&apos;s representationsin favour of Lednicki have arrived at Moscow from Warsaw, and we have received hiscredentials from the  regency council of the kingdom of Poland.   The credentials entrusthim  with a mission for the protection of  the rights of Polish citizens in Russia, for thereturn of emigrants to Russia and Polish war refugees  to Poland, and for the  settlementof questions concerning the Polish State and Polish  private property in Russia.   TheGerman Ambassador, Count Mirbach, has intervened at the Commissariat for ForeignAffairs, and has  requested that Lednicki. should be received, because such is the wish ofthe  German Government in view of the fact that many questions connected with thereturn  of Polish war  refugees  are  dependent upon  it.   Consequently, the  People&apos;sCommissariat fur Foreign Affairs has informed Leduicki that the People&apos;s Commissariat,although faithful to the Brest-Litovsk  peace treaty, which has severed Poland fromRussia, knows that this treaty has not given to the Polish masses the right of free self-determination, and that, although the Councils Government has been forced to recognise the separation of Poland from Russia, that does not mean that the Peoples Commissariatis bound to recognise the regency council as representative of the.will of the Polish people.In view of  the fact that the Councils Government considers that the Polish people havethe right to free self-determination, it must consider the regency council only as a bodyset up as a result  of the  German occupation.    On the  other hand, there are  manyquestions concerning Poland and Lithuania which should be taken up.     [The editor of  the War Office  &quot;Daily Review  of the Foreign Press  &quot; adds thefollowino- note in regard to M. Lednicki:  Alexander Lednicki is the leader of the PolishDemocratic party in Russia, which  has consistently opposed the definitely pro-allypolicy of the National  Democrats and  the majority of  the Poles in Russia.  He waspresident of the Polish liquidation committee, when M. Kerensky was  premier.]SIBERIA.     The Czechs. Mr. Lockhart, telegraphing on the 14th June [No. 281], spoke of the czech forces in Siberia in terms  of high praise.   He said  that  in spite  of  theirsufferings their morale was unbroken whilst the relations of  the men with their officers was  as good as could be ; they had been  reported to be as  good as  French troops bythe French officers who were with them.   Fifty  per cent, o:&apos; the men had  received  ahigher and another 30 per cent, a middle education, whilst  there  was not an  illiterateman among them.
GEORGIA.    Independence. -[See  E.R.  LXXII p. 21  On the  14th  June  Mr. . Wardroptransmitted [No. 435, received the  27th June] a  telegram from  f ? Mr.  Stevens] inregard to Trans-Caucasia.   The  sender  said that the  question  of  separation had only been  finally  decided  on  the 1st  April  when  the  independence of Georgia wasproclaimed,  though it  had been  first raised  by the Georgian   National  Assembly in.November  last.   With  its  decision as  to  the  proclamation  of independence,  theGegechkori Government had  further decided to continue the war with Turkey and had therefore  recalled  its  peace delegates  from Trebizond.   On the 7th  April  theGegechkori Cabinet had resigned, and Chenkeli, president of the peace delegation, whohad returned from Trebizond, two days  later had  met  Sevin and  decided 1 to resume the peace negotiations.  Chenkeli had been appointed  Prime Minister and Minister forForeign Affairs)   On the  27th  May the independence of Georgia had been  againproclaimed  ; and its independence had been recognised by Germany.                                   BULGARIA.    Declaration by the new Prime Minister. According to a German wireless message,sent out on the 24th June, .M. Malinov, the new Bulgarian Prime Minister, in interviews with representatives of the. press said  that in  foreign&apos; policy they had taken over  agoodly heritage in which the  Bulgarian  nation, as  heretofore, would bring to  bear thewhole  of its strength in faithful&apos;brotherhood in  arms with  its  allies.  . The  PrimeMinister had also said to the  representative of the  German &quot; Balkan Zeitung &quot; :  &quot; Webegan the war together with  our allies ; we will also end it with them, firmly convincedthat by means of mutual support an honourable peace will be obtained.   The  Govern-ment  has the confidence of the King, but  assumes, however,  that  it also needs theconfidence of the popular factors of the national representation :  and  for this reason  itintends to convene the Chamber within a comparatively short period for an extraordinarysitting.  It has set for itself the the following tasks in connection with domestic policy.First, the exaltation of the authority of the law, in order that throughout the Bulgariannation the  belief may be strengthened that the new Government will only  consider theinterests of the country and the  interests of its sons who are shedding their blood forthe Fatherland, on the battlelields.   Secondly, the putting  in motion of every lever  inorder that economic problems which have been  called forth by the war, and which were rendered more difficult by the wars  duration, may  be solved in  a satisfactory  manner.Before all, the questions of the feeding and the  clothing of the nation will be considered.These two points are the  most important  in the  Governments programme regardingdomestic policy ; but it does not renounce the carrying  through  of  reforms  of  a  socialcharacter.   The Government has not taken office in the present  serious times in orderto realise its own party programme,  but in order to solve the above-mentioned tasks.&quot;                                   PALESTINE.    Proposed Russian  Jewish Legion. The &quot;Daily Review  of  the Foreign Press&quot;(War Office) states that the  Jewish Correspondence Bureau at The Hague has received information from Russia, to the effect that  among Russian Jews  there is a movement on foot for the formation of a Jewish legion for service in  Palestine.   The movement, it isexplained,  is  the result of Mr.  Balfour&apos;s statement  defining Great  Britain&apos;s  attitudetowards Zionism.  The &quot;Deutsche Zeitung &quot; of Odessa, the  official organ of the german authorities, reported on the 3rd June that a big Jewish organisation had been discoveredwhich aimed at recruiting  Jews  from the former imperial army for the Palestine front,sending them via Vladivostok to  Palestine.   The German military authorities havemade numerous arrests, including two rabbis.     Proposed Establishment of  a  Polish  Zionist Colony. The &quot; Daily Review  of theForeign Press&quot; also says that the Jewish Correspondence Bureau at The Hague reportsthat Polish Zionists have resolved to collect 1,000,000 marks for the  establishment of a colony in Palestine.     The  Zionist  Commission. -Telegraphing on  the  29th June  [P.  257],  GeneralClayton said  that the confidence of the Jerusalem Jews had been won by this commis-sion,  which, on Soudan lines, had  already organised  reconstruction work as well  aseducational and religious matters.  For the present the continuation of work on thelines  laid down was the proper  course, leaving for the future any striking  developmentof Zionist  policy.
                                     ARABIA.NE.IT).     Ibn Saud. In November last Colonel Hamilton had interviews with  Ibn  Saud, inthe course of which the relations of the latter with the Ajmans, the possibility of the capture of Hail, and his relations with  King-  Hussein, were discussed; and  notes ofthese conversations have just been received.   The greater part of  the  subject matter has already been dealt with in other reports [E.R. XLIX, pp. 4 and 5,  and LII, p. 5],but Colonel Hamilton made certain  remarks in regard to  the  relations  between ibn saud and King Hussein which it may be well to reproduce.   What  is certain, he says,is that should the Allies win and the Turks be driven  out of Arabia  i Ibn Saud]  willhave the  mortification  of  finding his rival  firmly established as  an influential  andpowerful monarch, able to count on the support of Great Britain and the Mahommadanworld whilst he remains a Beduin chieftain, as he  was before the  war, but with theShammar  and the northern Anizeh  irretrievably lost and [King Hussein]  claimingoverlordship over the border tribes.   If,  on the other hand, the Central Powers conquer,as he thinks they will, he will have the satisfaction of seeing King  Hussein go down,while, as regards his own position, he relies on his political acumen  to  drive  some  sort of bargain with the Turks.     This does not mean that  Ibn  Saud  is pro-Turk.  lie hates  the Turks, as  hisancestors did,  and he likes  and admires the British, infidels though they  are.   But itis a matter of policy, and when policy is concerned he must regard the matter  entirely from the point of view of self-interest, i,e., the interests of his dynasty and the Wahabifaith.  He will not be induced to take any action unless the object is justified primarily in these interests : in other  words, he has got it into  his head that he is  not going topull the chestnuts out of the fire for us or for anyone.   This is perhaps the reason thatIbn  Saud  has not attempted seriously to  take Hail or perform any  noteworthy  featduring the war.   He hopes that when our subsidies cease, the tribes now supporting[King Hussein] will return to their former  allegiance.  He says  that [the King] isalready on bad terms  with some  of the  Harb, and  told me one  day with  manifestelation that the Baqhah  section  of the Ataibah  had been converted in  a  body to theIkhwan a religious  brotherhood which  Ibn Saud is fostering  to  the utmost of his ability.     If the view  of  Ibn Saud&apos;s  policy which  he  had endeavoured to  set  down  was correct, it would  be  seen how foolish it would be to expect any thorough co-operation from  him  even if more liberally subsidised.  Indeed, it is quite  probable that  any additional subsidies we might  give  him  would be used to buy back  the  Harb  andAtaibah  chiefs who are  now with [King Hussein].   The only thing he could think ofthat would induce Ibn Saud to undertake a  big  movement on our  behalf, would be togive assurances regarding his future  boundaries, both territorial and  tribal, and tosatisfy him as to his persona! status vis-a-vis the King of Hejaz.  After  which  thesinews of war,  money and arms would have  to be given  with a liberal hand. what could he then  give as his part of the  bargain ?  From his observation of the esteem inwhich Abdul Aziz was held in Central and South Central Arabia- he believed that he could,if he chose to put his heart into it, raise the whole country.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     Educational  Difficulties. The compiler of  a Mesopotamia  Fortnightly report which has just come  to hand  calls attention  to the fact that there has  been  some difficulty  in  regard to the  appointment  of the  men  who  were to give lessons inreligious instruction in the Government  primary  schools.   The  strength, of  the familytie in the East was, he said, well known, and it was not surprising  to  find that few ofthe men recommended were unrelated to one or  other  of  the members  of either theWaqf or  the   Education Committee  ; but it was considered that  to recommend as areligious  instructor  a  man who was recently  breaking stones for .fighting with- aprostitute in the street was carrying family affection to the point of prejudice, and thecommittees were asked to explain their action.   As a way out of the difficulty they had suggested that the director of education,  Husni  Etfendi, and  the  headmaster of the schools should appoint  the  teachers  of religious instruction an admirable suggestion which had been accepted.     He also reported that, thanks to the energy of the political officer, a primary schoolhad  been  opened at Kerbela, and  that the two schools which had been opened in baghdad  East were doing unexpectedly  well.   The Bab-al-Shaykh school had  71 boys,-and the Ras-al-Qaryah  130 twice-as many as the latter could properly hold.
                                     PERSIA.     The Shah. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 27th June [No. 585] that the Shah&apos;s;,forced abdication was believed by the Russian commanding officer of the Cossacks to be inevitable.  The feeling against him for having bolstered up the Cabinet was  certainlyrunning high, and was being excited by a number of anonymous leaflets untruly accusing-Sir Charles of having  sought to bring about the deposition of the Shah.  Many of thesepamphlets had been issued by partisans of the Cabinet : this was beyond doubt.   ShahAbdul Azim  had been included in  the  anti-ministerial demonstration ;  this was  to bejoined by the majority of the religious leaders, and therefore Teheran would be leftwithout preachers  during&apos; Ramadan.    The  Cabinet, he  thought,  could  not for longsurvive such  pressure  : when  it fell, his  idea was that the  vShah would appoint anyonerather than Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, probably either Saad-ed-Dowleh or Ain-ed-Dowleh.     Abadeh. On. the 29th June Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 589] a message, datedthe same day, from the consul at Ispahan, who said  that fighting  had begun again onthe  previous  night; on the 1st July he telegraphed [No. 591] that  further information had been  received to  the effect  that all  the South Persian Rifles had  desertedto the enemy, who had  occupied Abadeh,   The Indian  troops and  the British officers were holding out in the barracks.     The Bakhtiari. Telegraphing  on the 2nd July [Nos. 593  and 596] Sir C. Marlingsaid that  the attack on Abadeh had shown that the infection was spreading north fromFars,  and now the  latest news  from Ispahan made  it obvious that certain  of theBakhtiari khans were working to bring  off  a coup.   Sirdar Jang and Ameer Mufakhamwere doing what they could to thwart it, but the  chief of  those working  for it wereMurteza Qulikhan and Bibi Mariam, the former of whom was son of the President ofthe  Council  and nephew of the Minister of War, from both of whom he was gettingsomething more than tacit support.     Farman Farma&apos;s Claim.  [E.R.  LXXIV,  p.  5]. Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed[No. 583] that Farman Farma did not pretend that  the loss  from  his  estates was evenremotely due to his connection with us it  was due to  requisitions by Russian  troops(either not paid for  or inadequately  paid for) or to military  operations.  The  loss was mentioned, not to justify any claim on us, but to explain why he had so fixed thispart of his price.   Sir C. Marling added that zealous service by Farman Farma was ofgreat value, and. the only point worthy of consideration was as to its being worth what he had asked.                                AFGHANISTAN.     Monthly  Report. In  his  report on Afghanistan, for the month of June  the Viceroysaid that the  situation remained quiet.  Early in the month Sir  Alexander  McRobertshad returned from Kabul and had. reported that all  was quiet, and that there wasno war excitement.  Whilst at Kabul  he had been  treated in a particularly friendlymanner.o
