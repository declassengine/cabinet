On the  7th  June, Mr.  Bell  telegraphing  fromHelsingfors [No. 311], transmitted the following message from Mr. Parker :      For six days I waited at the Finnish frontier, in the company of the representativesof the Finnish and French  governments and of the Danish Red  Cross, to get intocommunication with the Bolshevik government or the Danish Red Cross representative in Petrograd regarding the exchange of war  prisoners and  the repatriation of Britishcivilians.   Finally, on Wednesday last the chief commissioner  for northern Russia-came to the bridge  and I arranged  with him  an exchange on the lines of your proposal to archangel.   He could  not agree definitely to this exchange, but  promised to submit the proposal to Moscow and  to communicate the decision personally.  The  same  night,i.e.t  Wednesday, the bridge  on which  our  meeting had taken place was blown up bythe Bolsheviks, and since then no reply has&apos; been possible.   The Danish Red  Cross isnow, with  the permission of the Finnish  authorities, communicating by wireless withthe Soviet government in Moscow  regarding a  reply to my  proposal, and  suggesting the evacuation of British civilians by sea from Petrograd.SIBERIA.     General Situation. On the 3rd June Mr. Robertson, telegraphing from vladivostock[No.  511],  transmitted  the following message  which  had  been  sent from Omsk  byMr.  Hodgson :      An extraordinarily rapid advance brought the armies to Glazov a month ago.  Thecommander of the western army, General  Hangin, had however allowed his forces toget out of touch with his reserves, and therefore could not withstand the Red army whichhad been heavily reinforced  : and the treachery of a Ukrainan  regiment, which  desertedafter murdering  its officers, aggravated the situation.   A retreat along the  whole linefollowed.   The  latest news from the western army is better, and the bad  militarysituation would only be of momentary import but for the unsound position in the rear.
     The government should be in a position to give better conditions of existence thanthose found in Bolshevik territories :  but it cannot do this.   At present the only classeshaving any reason to be grateful for the overthrow of the  Bolsheviks are the official and bourgeois :  the peasants, though many of them have  money, are  without eitherclothing or essential supplies, whilst the industrial class finds the  cost of living in theUrals constantly on the increase with no  hope of any improvement in  the  materialconditions  of life.   Both classes  had suffered from Bolshevism, and  welcomed  thecoming of the Siberian army.   They expected, much and got nothing.     The government has no capable men at its disposal for the inauguration of internalreforms, and  at the  same  time,  for  lack of  transport,  it cannot procure  materialnecessities : that is, it cannot reconcile the population to the new regime  by  betteringthe  situation.   The ministers are men  of narrow outlook, and  the higher officials are either inexperienced or belong to the old bureaucratic school.  Everything depends onAdmiral Kolchak.     Proclamation  by  Admiral  Kolchak.- Colonel  Summerville  has   telegraphed[No. 2919] the following  proclamation  made by Admiral  Kolchak on the 20th May :      Citizens of Russia,  the army which I lead  continues with unshaken resolution itsstruggle for the liberation  of  Russia and  draws  nearer  each day to  its sacred goal.I solemnly declare  at this fateful moment that  I  make war  not on the Russian peoplebut on the criminal and mutinous organization of the Bolsheviks ; neither  ....  norpersecution is my object.  Those who have perpeti*ated no  atrocity and committed nocrime have nothing to fear from me ;  and all who have been forced against their will tohelp the Bolsheviks in their  work will receive a complete amnesty from the government.I assumed office in order to  establish  in  the country order, justice, and  freedom, and togive  security and  bread to the harassed  and  famine-stricken  population.  In everyplace through which  our victorious armies pass  it is my wish  that justice should be restored, local administration and legal  rights established, the  law abiding protected,and  law breakers punished.   The office I ha\e assumed  is a heavj&apos; burden and I haveno intention of  retaining it for a  single day longer than  the interests of the countrydemand.  As soon  as Bolshevism is finally  crushed  my first  care  will be  to call for ageneral election  to a national constituent assembly.     To this constituent assembly I shall hand over all my powers in order that it may decide on the future form of government.   I  have already signed a law  guaranteeingfor the current year to all workers the produce of the land  they  have  cultivated  andsown.  With the object of assisting in every way the small peasant holders I intend infuture enactments  to transfer to  them, by due legal process, the  lands  of the largelandowners who will be paid a suitable compensation.  1 am  profoundly convinced that russia will be prosperous and strong only when  the  many millions of Russian  peasantsare fully provided with land.    I am  equally convinced that the law  shotdd provide protection for the workmen,  in order to secure their self-organization on lines similar tothose of the west.   A special labour department is preparing data for future legislation on this subject.     General Semenoff. --On the  29th May, Sir  Charles  Eliot transmitted [No. 502,received  6th June] a telegram  sent from  Omsk by Mr.  Hodgson, who  reported thesettlement of the Semenofi question and the apparent satisfaction  of Admiral  Kolchakwith the situation.   General Semenoff, Mr.  Hodgson said, having  abandoned  his claim for an independent command, was to  have the fifth army corps.                                    POLAND.     Demands  of  the   Lithuanian  Government. Mr.  Grant Watson,  telegraphing[No. 103] from  Libau on the. 9tb  June,  reportedthat the Lithuanian government asked that the allies should oblige the Polish government to agree  to the following :      1. A line of demarcation following the  Grodno Orani and Vilna railway, the polish forces remaining east and the Lithuanian west of  this line.     2. That its troops  should  not advance north  of the present hue  of demarcationbetween the German and Polish forces along the Augustowo canal.     3. The negotiation  of  a permanent agreement with  Lithuania in regard to the disposition of the Polish and Lithuanian forces.     Recognition by Sweden. On the  6th  June Mr. Clive reported [No. 974]  that theSwedish government had&apos;decided to  recognize Poland as a free  and independent state,and that an official anmmncement had been made to that effect.
                                    RUMANIA.     Mr. Bratiano. On  the 7th June Mr. Balfour reported [No. 1026] the intention ofMr.  Bratiano to return to Rumania forthwith and to resign his office.  Mr. Clemenceauhad  been so informed by Mr. Bratiano himself.                                    TURKEY.     French Diplomacy. On the 4th June the high commissioner in Turkey telegraphed[No. 1193] at some length in regard  to  the  conduct of his  French  colleague in  thematter of the invitation to Turkey to send delegates to Paris.     The French high commissioner apparently received  notice of this invitation a day before Admiral Calthorpe, and then, alone and in person, communicated it to the grandvizier.  After this,  in spite  of Admiral Calthorpe&apos;s protest, he published in the press astatement to the effect that  the invitation had been sent in consequence of what he himself had done.   His organ, commenting on the communique,  said that it  felt greatpleasure  in making the announcement :  it had  often  emphasized the former friendly relations with France, and it was not without a certain pride that it pointed  that thatnation, whose generosity had never failed, had put out a  helping hand to Turkey in  thetime of her greatest misfortune.  &quot; France cannot betray her traditions,&quot; it added, &quot; sobe of good cheer.&quot;     Admiral Calthorpe went on to say that  in to-day&apos;s newspapers the reply of  theFrench president to  a  telegram from  the   crown  prince  of Turkey had  too been published.   The crown prince had telegraphed to Mr. Poincare asserting the friendshipof Turkey  for France.  The prince&apos;s message  was sent  through the French  high com-missioner, and to him Mr. Pichon telegraphed, in the name of Mr. Poincare, instructing him to convey the presidents thanks for the telegram and to communicate to his highnessthat France would neglect nothing affecting the vital interests of Turkey she wouldbe faithful  to her traditions.     Admiral Calthorpe noted that this telegram was a proof that not merely its localrepresentative but  the French  government  itself had broken  away  from  the . alliedsolidarity:  and he added that  the  French  high  commissioner had  begun  an opencampaign of propaganda,  making full use of the means and agents under his control.     On the 7th June Mr. Balfour  telegraphed [No. 1028] to Lord Curzon saying thatMr. Clemenceau had explained that Mr. Poincaire&apos;s message was a reply to one sent bythe Turkish crown prince before  there  had been any discussion of the question of thegrand  viziers coming to Paris.   Mr. Lloyd George had pointed out that the sending ofsuch a message was  an  encouragement  of the old  Turkish game of playing off onepower against another, and had submitted that the sending of it was highly improper.Mr. Clemenceau admitted that the action taken was improper.     Mr.  Orlando mentioned that a similar telegram had been sent to the king of Italy :the Italian high commissioner had been instructed to co-operate with any action takenbv his colleagues.   .  On the 8th June Lord Curzon informed [No. 831] Mr. Balfour that a similar letterhad  been sent  to the  king  by the Turkish  heir apparent,  and  that  bis majesty hadnaturally declined to send any answer.  Lord  Curzon submitted that the action of  theFrench government was  disloyal to the  allied  cause, and he proposed to speak to  theFrench ambassador  on the subject.     The  Delegation to Paris.   On the 4th and 5th June Admiral Calthorpe reported[Nos. 1194 and 1205] that it hadbeen settled that the grand vizier should leave on  the7th  June  on  a French man-of-war :  he was due in Paris  a  week later.   He,Admiral  Calthorpe, had  not  mush  fear of  his  highness being  corrupted by  theFrench in spite of  the efforts they were making.   He considered that  Turkey neededguidance and help :  and he desired that that work should be  entrusted to one  power.On account of the ability she has shown in governing  Moslems  he  wished for Britain,and failing her America.   He wras absolutely opposed to the idea of French control.     The grand vizier was,  Admiral Calthorpe said, reconciled  to the  loss  of Syria,Arabia, and Mesopotamia : but  he was bent  on securing the whole of Asia Minor  aswell  as Constantinople, and  enough of Thrace to serve for its defence.     Admiral Calthorpe added that in his  opinion it would be impossible to send a more suitable  delegate :  he had  found him sincere,  straightforward, well-intentioned, andsurprisingly energetic, whilst his private life was beyond reproach.     Tewtik Pasha would  be  unable  to go with  the&apos; grand  vizier as  he  was sufferingseverely  from sciatica,  but he would follow a little later.
     The Greeks in Asia Minor and  the Islands. Telegraphing from  Athens  on the &amp; 3rd June [No. 302], Mr. Eussell transmitted a message sent  on the previous  day from Chios by the consul, who reported that the Greek troops  had that same day occupied Alatsata Chesme.  The Greek troops had  he  said  been welcomed by the  Turkish population and the occupation had taken place without incident.     On the 5th June Admiral Calthorpe transmitted [No. 1198] a message sent from Smyrna on the 4th by Mr. Morgan reporting that Nazli, which was outside the  Greek zone,  had been  occupied  by  the  Greeks.    This  had been  done  without previous authorization, and there had been no  disorders to justify the measure.   The  Greeks had been notified by the commodore in command of the British jEgean squadron that they should obey the strict orders of the conference.                           SYRIA  AND  PALESTINE.     Emir Feisal ana  the  Zionists. General  Clayton has reported [No. 313] that already at the beginning of  last month Emir Feisal had  begun  the work of breaking down the dislike of the  Arabs to the policy of the Zionist Jews.  He  had  informed an Arab delegation in Damascus that  he did not consider the  aims . of  the Arabs  to be incompatible with  those of  the Zionists; and this  declaration appeared to have been favourably received.   He was inviting the members of the Zionist commission to pay him a visit.     Suppressed Circular of the Jerusalem Moslem-Christian Society. On the 2nd June General  Clayton reported  [No.  328, received  9th  June] that the  Moslem-Christian society of Jerusalem had proposed to issue the following circular, but  General Allenby, considering it undesirable, had withheld permission :      We, the  undersigned,  authorize the Moslem-Christian  society  to apply  to the expected  commission of the powers for  confirmation  of our  wishes  which  are as follows :      1. That Syria, from the Taurus mountains  on the  north,  the  Khapur and the Euphrates on the east, Akaba and Rafa on the south be absolutely independent without protection or a mandatory.     2. That Palestine  (southern  Syria),  which  is an inseparable  part of  Syria, be independent &apos;- in the interior.&quot;  It should select its governor from natives, and its laws should be in conformity  with the wishes of the native inhabitants and  the requirements of the country.     3. We completely refuse to allow Palestine to be turned  into a national home for the  Jews.   Also we  do not  admit  any  Jewish  emigrant into our  country, and energetically protest against the Zionist movement.  The native Jews who are already inhabitants of the country should be considered as natives and  possess  privileges and[ ? J misfortunes as we do (this is averse from the Koran).     General Clayton added  that he had been informed unofficially that the  Christians,whilst  agreeing with the circular, considered that the assistance of a  mandatory power was essential.                                     ARABIA.     Ibn  Rashid On the 8th June General Allenby telegraphed [No. 937] saying thathe considered that steps should be taken to encourage  Ibn  Rashid without delay. Hewas a traditional enemy of Ibn  Saud  and was probably hostile  to and afraid of the Wababite movement.     To deal with him through  King Hussein would mean delay, and he considered that action  should be taken at once by Baghdad.   At the same time King Hussein should be kept fully informed  and  should continue negotiations on his own behalf with Ibn Rashid.                                     PERSIA.     Trouble at Urumia.-On  the  4th June  Sir Percy Cox reported [No. 394] that, according to information received from the governor of  Urumia,  the Kurds were making trouble in the  country round about  that place.   They had attacked the town itself but had been beaten off ; they had  too fired on a ship with Persian soldiers on board.     Telegraphing again on the 9th June he transmitted a message, dated the 24th May, from Dr. . Packard  (an  American  missionary  in Urumia) which had been forwarded by the  British consul  at  Tabriz.   Dr.  Packard  said that, as the result of fighting, the Kurds had  been  driven from  the  town  by the  Persians who had then attacked the
Christians  in  the American mission grounds.  They had killed a couple of hundred ofthem and  wounded another hundred-; and  in addition the mission property had beenlooted by a civilian mob.  Dr. Packard asked tbat help should be sent immediately.     Tlie Kurdish version of the business was given in a telegram, dated the  4th  June,sent from  Salmas by Simko.   According to this, a number  of poor Kurds had beenattracted to  Urumia by Dr. Packard&apos;s relief:  suddenly they and the Christians were attacked by the Persians who massacred a large number,  took Dr. Packard prisoner,and  pillaged  the compound.   All this  was done without any apparent reason, and whatever tbe Kurds did subsequently was mere vengeance.     Simko said that Salmas and its district was quiet, and the  same was officiallyreported of the Khoi district.     Sir Percy Cox added that the American consul was. about to visit Simko, and, ashe  would  be  accompanied  by  the ex-governor of Urumia, it  was hoped that somesatisfactory arrangement would be brought about.                                AFGHANISTAN.     To negotiate with the Amir. On the 5th June the viceroy reported that he hadselected  Sir Alfred  Grant, K.C.I.E., foreign  secretary to tbe  government  of India, toact as the British representative in the event of negotiations with the amir.   He wouldbe accompanied by Mr. Maffey as political adviser.     Armistice Terms. In reply to the request of the amir of Afghanistan for a cessation of hostilities and a discussion of terms at Lundi Kotal or Peshawar, the viceroy of india has  caused the Afghanistan government to be made  acquainted  with the followingarmistice terms, which must be carried out before the Indian government can enter into further discussions:      1.  The Afghans shall withdraw 20 miles from our present positions.     2.  We shall maintain our present positions.     3.  Our aeroplanes shall be allowed to reconnoitre over  the Afghan lines  but not to           bomb.     4.  The frontier troops shall be discouraged from  carrying on active hostilities by           the Afghan government.     No reply to these conditions has as yet been received from the Afghan government.     Operations. The following  communique  was  put out  by the  India  Office  onthe 5th June :      Information received  from the government  of India, dated  3rd and  4th June,shows that an enemy position on low  hills  two miles north-west of Thai was attacked and captured by our troops on 2nd June, and that General Nadir  Khan, commanding the Afghan forces operating round Thai has applied for a cessation of hostilities under orders received  by him from the  amir,   He has been given certain periods  of time inwhich to  start withdrawing his force to  Afghan  territory,  and  within  which  tocomplete it.     There is no change in the situation to  the north  of the Kabul, river or in  Tirah.Some portions of the Orakzai and Zaimukht tribes  have joined the Afghans, but  thebulk of these two tribes have not committed themselves.     It  is reported that there is now no enemy east of the Kurram river.  The situationin the Tochi valley  is now  quieter owing to the  successful  action of our troops nearMiramshah on the 1st June,  but  tribal lashkars  are still reported to be active  in  theJandoal Murtaza  area.  Incursions  by Mahsuds  and  Sharannis are reported to have occurred on our border to the west of Dera Ismail Khan.     From  Chitral reports have been received of an Afghan advance up the Kunar riverfrom Asniar; to meet this our Chitral column has taken up a, position astride  the Kunarriver north of Birkot.  [Birkot is about 25 miles higher up the Kunar river than Asmartowards Ohitral, and is on the Afghan-British boundary.]     Bolshevik Propaganda. There are  signs that  the  Bolshevik  propaganda  in afghanistan and India is continuing.   A small Afghan force from Herat has arrived on the  Persian frontier.  The  Afghan  commander there received  orders  to send sixbattalions  to Kabul.   He was unable to comply, as he knew that his troops  would notobey.   It thus appears that the natives in this neighbourhood are not anxious for war.The amir, it  is stated, is endeavouring  to buoy up his troops with hopes of help fromRussia.
