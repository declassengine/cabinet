APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  LXXXIV.                                      RUSSIA.     THE assassination of Captain Cromie is to  be noted as marking a fresh epoch in Bolshevik history.   His murder is  probably a double  reprisal for Mirbach and Lenin. The terrorist system has now apparently been adopted by both sides, and the Bolshevik threat that Entente statesmen are to  be included in the programme is probably not an idle one.   After the war  is over the  Bolsheviks  will  in  all likelihood continue their operations.     M. Milyukow, although still nominal leader of the Cadets, is now in a very singular position.   He advocated pro-Germanism as an  avowedly opportunist policy, and not o dy did his party- disagree with him,  but, moreover, the Germans  are aware that his proposals were only of a temporary nature ; he cannot therefore expect to inspire much enthusiasm.                                  MESOPOTAMIA.    The  reports thereon are interesting and  should be read.                                     PERSIA.    Mar Shimuj\ is the prince  patriarch of the  Nestorians of Hakhiari  and Jelhu.

It sounds incredible, but nevertheless is the evidence of a Moslem who is not pro-Armenian.  This policy, which vas been followed by the Turks since- 1896, has naturally had its effect on the Armeniancharacter.  In reading reports of alleged Armenian outrages in  Baku  and elsewhere,it  must  be remembe?^  that refugees who escape 1  from  these horrors in  Turkeyswarmed  into the Caucasus, and  that  the memory of  what  they  bad endured is not easily eradicated.    The Turkish purpose has been  extermination.  Their calculation, in event of Germanfailure in the West, is probably that a few words of regret on the part of the ottoman government in regard to the excess of zeal of a few unauthorised persons will suffice Lomollify the  Entente  Powers, and  that as the Armenians have been reduced in numbers&amp;bset the  great  principle  of  self-determination  will be  a  safe card to  play.   Thevarious reports of the new  Sultaifs character  and honesty of purpose are most likely  a 3art of this simple scheme.                                                                         M.

On the 3rd September  Sir RalphPaget transmitted [No. 2602] the  following  telegram,  which was  sent by the DanishMinister in Petrograd to  the Danish Foreign Office:  On the 31st August the Govern -ment troops forced their way  into the British  Embassy, their entry  to which wasresisted by the British naval  attache,  Captain Cromie, who, after  having killed threesoldiers,  was himself shot.   The  archives were  sacked and , everything was  destroyed.Captain Cromie&apos;s corpse was treated in a horrible  manner : the Cross of St. George wastaken from the body and subsequently worn  by one of the  murderers.  An Englishclergyman was refused permission to repeat prayers over the body.     As an attack on  the  French Embassy is to be feared it has  been put in  a state ofdefence.   The  French military   mission was forced, but  everything had already been removed.   A man named Mazon and a soldier and several Frenchmen were arrested.The Bolsheviks in the press openly incite to the murder of the British and the French.It is urgently necessary that prompt and energetic steps be taken.     Order forHhe Arrest of Allied  Subjects  in Moscow. Sir Ralph  Paget on  the31st  August transmitted [No.  2573] a telegram, dated the 29th  August, from  theFrench consul-general in Moscow which  had been  forwarded through the  DanishMinister in  Petrograd.   The  consul-general  said  that  on that  day,  29th  August,  adecree had been published prescribing the arrest of all  subjects of the  allied  nationsbetween 18 and 40 years of age.     Attempted Assassination of M.  Lenin.-A Russian wireless message sent out onthe 31st August announced that an attempt  had been made on the life of M. Lenin ashe was leaving a  meeting of workmen in a Moscow suburb : a second message announcedimprovement in  his  condition.    Another  message  gave particulars  in  regard to  hisassailant.  She is a young woman, said to belong  to the Revolutionary Socialists of  theRight,  and  to be very  much  opposed to the state of things created by the Octoberrevolution : she is too a whole-hearted supporter of the  constituent  assembly.       [898-111]                      *                                   B
    Assassination of a Soviet official. According to another Russian wireless message,also sent out on the 81st August. M. Uritski, the commissioner for the northern regionfor home affairs,  was shot by a man named Kannegiesser, a student of the Polytechnic,lately a junker of the artillery college,  and chairman of the socialist junker group.   Hewas, the message said,  arrested at the house of the Petrograd British Association.    Proclamation by  the Government  of the  Northern Region. The  proclamationprinted in the last report [p.  1] has since been telegraphed by Mr. Lindiey [No. 94].  Itshould end as  follows : Long live the Constituent Assembly !  Down with the germans and their tools, Lenin and Trotsky, who deceived people and betrayed Russia !   Long .live free democratic Russia.    M. Milyukow and  the Germans. Sir R. Paget telegraphed from Copenhagen on the28th August [No. 2537] that the following information had been  received from Russia :M. Milyukow  was rarely at Kiew with M. Vinaver.   The former carried on negotiationswith the Germans on  the following basis :  Russia to make peace with Germany, whowas  to  withdraw her troops  from   Russia;   Germany to  renounce  her  claim  toLithuania and to work for  the reunion of  Ukraine, the  Caucasus, and Lithuania withRussia M.  Milyukow only agreeing  to the  exclusion  of  Poland  and Finland ; thequestion of Courland and Esthonia&apos; to remain open till the general  peace, after which thewhole peace treaty was to be revised on the basis now laid down &quot;;  Germany to renounceher special economic  privileges in Russia.    At  the conference of the Cadet,  party (which,  however, was not representative)M. Milyukow&apos;s programme was almost unanimously rejected, M. Vinaver proposed that,the. party should  stick  to its former pro-Entente  policy:&apos;    It had  been  reported from a good source that, though M. Milyukow. was in disagree-ment not only with &apos; the  decision  come  to but  with  most of the party,  he still in fact remained its leader, and his influence and policy  would remain predominant;    Nothing was known as to Germany&apos;s answer, or as to whether negotiations had been broken off.    Bolsheviks and Germans. On 30th August Mr. Clive telegraphed [No. 2475] from Stockholm that Germany, having  been  sounded by the Bolsheviks in regard to helpagainst allied military  intervention, had-given.such a dubious reply that it amounted toa refusal, and  that the Bolsheviks felt that their position  in  regard  to Germany hadbeen badly weakened.  The authority for this was Mr. Ransome, who stated that he haddefinite knowledge, of the facts.EsTHONIA.    Finnish Proposals. Mr. Clive telegraphed on  29th August [No. 2470] that thefollowing information&apos;had been received from the Esthonian Bureau;in Stockholm&apos;: TheWhite Goverhmebt  of&quot;Finland, had  made a &apos;proposal to  that part of the  formedEsthoniari &apos;Landtag.&apos;  which had  neither been imprisoned nor carried&apos; but of the country by the occupying German authorities to the effect that a union should: be made betweenEsthonia and Finland. &quot;This proposal had been rejected.1SIBERIA.    General Horvat&apos;s  go up-de-main  [E.R. LXXXIII, p.  21. Sir Charles Eliot, tele-graphing  on the 28th August  [No.  7], said that the difficulty  of forming a coalition government had been very much increased, by General PleshkofPs  action.   GeneralHorvat denied that it was  at his instigation,  but this was  difficult of belief: in the.course of-conversation he had suggested the possibility of the town police placing them-selves under his&apos; orders, that is,&quot; deserting the Siberian  Government&apos;. &quot; Sir Charles  Eliot,had warded, him that this might  prove disastrous to himself, General Horvat, personally;:in any case  the consequences&apos; &quot;would be very serious.   Sir Charles Eliot  had  but  little hope of a satisfactory  compromise, as  General Horvat would not be satisfied with anunostentatious but, influential position:  he clearly wished  to. be, the recognised, head, ofany Government to which&apos; he belonged.  He (General  Horvat) had^ however, promised.to renew his efforts to form a coalition.   Apparently, he not, only represented the,propertied, classes in that part of the  world, but also  was regarded as representing  in east Siberia the  principles of Generals  Alexieff and Korniloff, so that in regard to taking.any steps against him great  caution would be advisable.  The American high commdsj;sioh iiacl already  told the. Siberian  Government that he ought to be removed.
    M. Lavrov, the head of the Siberian Government,  had expressed his readiness toform a coalition which should include the members of General Horvat&apos;s cabinet.  Theinclusion of General  Horvat himself seemed to him to be impracticable:  he could not guarantee the consent of his colleagues, but personally he was quite willing to give the.general an appointment analogous to that of a governorship under the old  regime.    On the following day Mr. Hodgson telegraphed [No. ISO] that, on the representa-tions of the allied consuls, the allied command had decided that the force which hadtransferred its allegiance from the zemstvo to General Pleshkoff should be disarmed, andthe order had been executed : about 250 officers and  men were affected.  The materialcomposing this force  was strongly pro-ally, particularly pro-British, and generally very good.   The incident was therefore  regrettable, but, having in view the danger of civilstrife, no other course was open ;  nothing could be done but give effect to the declarationof the protectorate that no armed persons should be in Vladivostock or its neighbour-hood if they were not dependent on the local authorities.  The population had alreadybeen excited to fever heat,  and socialist groups had determined to take violent action.    Help for  the Local Population.- Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Sir  Charles  Eliot  onthe 28th August [No. 10] saying that it had  been decided to supply goods, in concert with the allied Governments, for the relief of the Siberian population.  It  was  highly desirable  that, all taking  part should  act on the same guiding  principles,  and  HisMajesty&apos;s Government thought that those should be :  f 1) That, except in cases of actualdestitution, the transaction&quot;&apos; should  not  be  eleemosynary,  but  should be  made self-supporting, though (2) care should be taken to avoid raising  any  suspicion that Siberiawas being exploited for private gain.    Political Representation of Japan. Sir Conyngham Greene telegraphed on the 22ndAugust that the Japanese Government did not propose to apppint a High commissioner in Siberia, but it had.; established a department of political affairs at the general head-quarters of the Japanese expeditionary force at Vladivostock, of which Mr.  Matsudairahad been appointed chief.  He would direct all political affairs calling  for  local  treat-ment, and would, keep in touch with the allied civil and military authorities there.  Hewould co-operate with Sir Charles Eliot on all questions of mutual interest.   y                              PALESTINE.   . Recruiting for King Hussein. General Clayton telegraphed on the 2nd September[No. 54] that 200 recruits for the Hejaz army had been enrolled at Hebron.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    Tribal  News.-In  the Mesopotamia report for May, recently received from the india Office, the following information, in regard to the local tribes, is included :     1. The  Sinjabis, who had, in spite of promises, continued their connection, with theenemy,  have been split  up and thoroughly looted  by the  Kalkhanis  and  Kalhurssupported by a column of our troops.  &apos;Ali Akbar is a fugitive, and  it is unlikely thathe will give any further trouble.    &apos;Abdul  Karim, son of Fatah Beg and nephew of Mahmud Pasha  (free), who hashitherto shown himself pro-German and pro-Turk, is now thoroughly frightened, andwishes to  make his peace with us.    Shaykh Wahhab, son of Shaykh Hamud, of the Talabani Kurds, has now  come inopenly to  us, and has promised to bring something like 100 houses of cultivators on to hislands at Sanj Bulaq.    2. A Shabanaja  post was recently established on the Fallujah road at the expressrecommendation of the shaykhs of the Bani Tamim, the Shabanah being enlisted from the tribe in accordance with the  shaykhs&apos;  selection.  No sooner bad they  received  their arms than they held up and robbed  a  caravan  of  small merchants on  their way fromFallujah to Baghdad, wounding  the  caravan leader.   The crime is  serious, and  is beingseverely dealt with.    3. The  delimitation of the boundary between the  Zoba&apos;  and the Bani Tamim hasbeen  carried  out  by  the assistant  political  officers  of  Fallujah  and  Kadhimain.It has long been a cause of bitter hostility between the two tribes.
     4. The successful operations on the  Euphrates,  coupled with, the  opening of  the&apos;Aziziyah (Tash) canal, has enlarged the  tribal horizon  at Bammadi.  The  shaykhs of&quot;the Albu Mahal and Albu Mar&apos;i sections have asked permission to cultivate the &apos; Aziziyahlands, and a brother of Nijris al Qa&apos;ud, of the Albu Nimr, has asked leave  to  come in.Nijris himself is still with the Turks.     5. It appears from the papers captured  at &apos;Anah from Lieutenant Preusser that&apos;Ali Sulaiman, the leading shaykh of the Dulaim, has  written once or twice to  theGerman agent since the occupation of Bammadi, but there is no indication of espionageor actual help given by him to the enemy.   He has, on the contrary, been useful to usin intercepting enemy caravans, but he has never concealed  his  anxiety lest we shouldone clay leave him to the mercy of the Turks, and his letters are no doubt due to  the wish to provide himself with a means of  excuse in that  extremity.     6. Faraj  al &apos;Abullah, shaykh of one  of the most powerful town tribes of Kubaisah,has been appointed government representative on a salary and given four police.  Theestablishment of a small  military post at Kubaisah will  assist the enforcing of theblockade, as well as keep off predatory nomads.     7. A British officer has recently replaced at Diwaniyah the native A.P.O. who hasbeen there since  September.  Diwaniyah is an important centre, as it controls the richagricultural districts on the Dagharah canal tilled by two tribal groups, those of &apos;Afajto the south, and &apos;Aqrah  to the north.   The leading shajddi of the &apos;Afaj group, HajiMukhifi has considerable authority over the whole canal, and is  a  man of remarkableparts.   His attitude towards our administration  is  very satisfactory.   In the Aqrahgroup  there is&apos; no local authority, and the  constituents have been constantly at warwith each other, the chief quarrel being between the  Hamad under Sa&apos;dun an Pasan,and Shafan of the Shabanah.  Sa&apos;dun has lately  been stirring up  trouble among theZaiyad of &apos; Aqrah, but has now been brought to book, and the rebellious Sirkals of theZaiyad have been forced to submit to their shaykh, &apos;Alwan.  Intertribal troubles amongthe Jalihah and Shabanah have also been  settled, while  the Albu Nail, &apos;Amr andMujawir  have acknowledged  their  respective paramount  shaykhs.   The &apos;Amr and&apos;Albu Nail have voluntarily  knocked down a number of their own forts.   The  tribesas a whole  are tired  of the previous insecurity  and  strife and welcome the  prospectof  peace.     Shatrah and the &apos;Abudali Tribe. In the same report is included one on the Basrahvilayet, for the  second half of  April,  in  which  the  following note  on Shatrah isfound :      The position at Shatrah is very interesting.  This town  lies near the lower end ofthe river, which is known higher up as the Gharraf, and until seven years ago the wholestream flowed past  its doors.   But  since the Gharraf only carries water when  the tigris is in flood it silts up very rapidly.   Consequently it raises its beddevel so quicklythat from time to time it must burst out and find a new channel.  This occurred seven years  ago, when the  main  stream turned  down  the Bad&apos;ah channel, whose mouth isabout  3  miles above  Shatrah  town,  and  so found  its way to the Hammar lake.Thousands of acres in  the  country just north of Nasariyah were  thus thrown  out of cultivation, and great tribal dislocation followed.   The &apos;Abudah tribe, however, who-live all round Shatrah, were  near enough to the point  where the rivers part to be but little affected. Their country still remains very rich.     The head of this tribe is one Khaiyun al TJbaid, of the Sinajir section, who came into Nasariyah and made  friends with  us in the early  days, but  threw  us overafter Ctesiphon, and did us a lot of mischief.  When Baghdad fell he was one  of thoseexcepted  from the general amnesty.  He fled from Shatrah  and  spent  the summerencamped on  the banks of the Shatt-al-Kar.   With the return of autumn, however, heplucked  up courage,  and came  back and finally threw himself on the mercy of theGovernment,  and formally surrendered.  He was  forgiven, but order-ed to pay a  fine of10,000 rupees, which  he had  no difficulty in  doing, for  he is  very rich.    other arrangements having been tried  and failed, Khaiyun a  few months ago was made our representative, at Shatrah, which he has since ruled strongly and, after his lights, notunwisely.   But his rule is intensely unpopular, even among his professed friends, andis  bound to cause an  explosion  before long.  Even now the  political atmosphere inShatrah  is very highly charged with electricity, and I think that it would be unwise tosend a British officer  to  reside there permanently,  unless enough troops to secure his personal safety in the town  could be sent with him.
PERSIA.    The Armenian Refugees. Sir Charles Marling telegraphed on the  31st August[No. 769] that the new Armenian  patriarch, M^r Shimun, and three bishops with him,who could not be treated like the bulk of the Armenian  refugees, desired  to  live nearHamadan.  The vice-consul at that place had suggested that Mar Shimun should receive from His Majesty&apos;s Government a present, on the occasion of his elevation, and that an allowance of 500 tomans a month should be made to the four ecclesiastics.   Sir ChaidesMarling supported  this proposal.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.    The Embassy Outrage. On the 4th September Mr.  Balfdur  sent the following telegram to Sir Esme Howard at Stockholm  and Sir Walter Townley at The Hague for communication to M Chicherin : We have  received news that an outrageous attackhas been made on the British Embassy at Petrograd, that its contents have been sackedand destroyed, that Captain Cromie, who tried to defend it, was murdered and his bodybarbarously mutilated.  We demand immediate reparation and the prompt  punishmentof anyone responsible for or concerned in this abominable outrage.  Should the russian soviet Government  fail to  give complete satisfaction, or should any further acts  of violence  be committed against  a British subject, His Majesty&apos;s Government will  hold the members of the  Soviet Government individually responsible, and will make every endeavour  to secure  that  they  shall be treated as outlaws  by the Governments of allcivilised nations, and that no place of refuge shall be left to them.    You have  already been informed through M. Litvinoff that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  was prepared to do everything possible to secure the immediate return of official representatives of  Great Britain  and of  the Russian Soviet Government to their respec-tive countries.   A guarantee was given  by His Majesty&apos;s Government that  as soon  as british  officials  were allowed to pass the Russo-Pinnish frontier, M. Litvinofl and all members of his staff should have permission to proceed immediately to Russia.    We have now learnt that a  decree was published on the 29th August ordering the arrest of all British  and  French subjects between the  ages  of 18  and 40,  and  thatBritish  officials  have been arrested  on  trumped-up charges of conspiring  against theSoviet Government.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government has  therefore found  it necessary toplace  M. Litvinoff and members  of  his staff  under  preventive arrest until such time asall  British representatives are  set  at liberty and allowed  to proceed to  the Finnishfrontier free from molestation.898-111]C

HISTORICALLY, French protection of the Latin Church in Turkey dates from 1528, when official action was taken by  Francis I of France in defence of Catholic interests  in  the  Ottoman  Empire.   The first Capitulations were concluded with France in 1535, and until the Capitulations with  England in 1583 Finance was the official protector of  all Europeans established in Turkey. In  1604 the French  Ambassador  at  the  Porte  obtained  a Hatt-i-Sherif confirming  and extending the privileges already granted  to Catholics,1 and promising immunity to all pilgrims to Jerusalem  travelling &quot; sous le nom et la protection de 1&apos;Empereur de France.&quot; 1   On the renewal of the Capitulations with  France in  1607  it  was  stated that  the  subjects  of all  nations  not represented at Constantinople  by an Ambassador should  be under  French protection.   Since the Koran was both the religious and civil code throughout the Ottoman Empire,  it was  eminently  desirable that  the members of  the European Christian communities in Turkey should be undei1 separate jurisdiction. At this period France was the  only Power that had  sufficient influence with the Porte to secure such privileges for her co-religionists.      The chief treaties  on  which the French base their claim  to exercise a religious protectorate in Turkey  are  the Capitulations  of 1673  and 1740, of which the  former3  confirmed  the privileges  already  granted to bishops  or &quot; autres religieux de secte latine, qui  sont sujets a la France, de quelque sorte qudls puissent  tre,&quot; and to pilgrims  to  Jerusalem  under French protection. The Capitulations of 1740s gave permission to all members  of &quot; Christian and hostile nations &quot; to continue as before to visit  Jerusalem  under the protection of  the French  flag, and guaranteed  certain rights to Roman Catholics.4 From these treaties France claimed a  monopoly of the  protection of Christians in Turkey;  but the wording of the Treaty of  Karlovitz5 (1699), the Treaty of Passarovitz5 (1718), and the Treaty of Belgrade6 (1739) would appear to place Austria  in  an analogous  position with  regard to Roman Catholics  in the Ottoman  Empire.   Most-favoured-nation  treatment was  conceded to  Great Britain by Article 18 of the English Capitulations, and to the  Netherlands by  Article  40 of the  Capitulations, of 1680.  The Republic of Venice was granted  certain  rights  of  protection  in  1718.   By the Treaty  of Kutchuk Kainardji&quot; in 1774  promises were made to  Russia corresponding to  those made  to  France regarding  Christians in Turkey,  and  subsequent Russian claims founded on  an  interpretation of this  treaty  led,  as  will be shown, to the Crimean War.     The  law of the Tanzimat7 in 1839 declared perfect  equality  between all Ottoman subjects, thus  abolishing  the  need for  an external  protectorate over any one section of the community.   In 1850,s however, France attempted to revive  the Treaty of 1740,  and demanded certain rights as to the Holy Places, which involved her eventually in a quarrel with Russia.   It was at this time  that Rnssia made the claim9 that the Treaty of Kutchuk Kainardji gave her the right to  protect  all members  of the Orthodox Chureh  in Turkey, whether foreigners or subjects of the Sultan, on the  analogy of the French protectorate of the Latin  Church.  It would appear that the force  of the analogy was recognised, for in the course of the dispute  the French Government strongly disclaimed all  right  to protect  Roman  Catholics  in  Turkey  other than  the  Latins  of the  Holy  Land,10  and  declared that they held  such protection as derogatory  to the  sovereign rights of the Sultan and  to the independence of the Porte, which  was guaranteed by  the five Powers  in the Treaty of London,  1841.11  The question of protection was  solved  by the Sultan himself  undertaking to maintain  and enforce the  privileges  of the Christian Churches  and their respective  clergy  throughout his  dominions.13 All efforts to avoid  war were,  however,  unavailing.    The Treaty of Parissigned on the 30th  March, 1856, between  Austria,  France, Great Britain,PrussiaRussia, Sardinia, and Turkey,  included a firman  of the Sultan13
reaffirming the previsions of the Tanzimat,  and further stipulated  that thesepromises of reform in no case gave the right to any of the signatory Powers tointerfere, either separately or  collectively,  in the Sultaifs  dealings  with hissubjects or in the  internal administration of the  Ottoman  Empire.   In  thecourse  of the negotiations the French Minister  for  Foreign Affairs entirelyagreed with the  principles laid down by the British Government  &quot; that itwould never do to  create, in the place of the protection claimed by Russia, the recognised  protection of the guaranteeing Powers, one of whom would  always have a preponderating influence,  with a  constant desire to make use ef it.&quot;1&apos;4&quot;  i* Lord Cowley,It was considered1&apos;1&apos; that  every precaution  bad been  taken in the  wording of  No. 1574.the article to prevent any danger of this kind.                                December 4, 1855.     In the years  succeeding the  conclusion of the  Treaty  of Paris, GreatBritain made constant representations at the Porte on behalf of Christians inthe  Ottoman  Empire.   In  1858  it  was  reported that France and  Russiaintended to establish a joint-protectorate over the  Christian subjects - of the sultan, and the  British representative was  instructed &quot;strongly to advise thePorte to resist this pretension before it became an established practice.&quot; 13   In   &quot;To Mr. Alison,1858 and 1859 ioint British  and French action was taken to obtain satisfaction  \0&apos; 6o&apos;    10,0f    i       ii     tiii      i  -                i                 ,11   January 21, loos.tor the outbreak at Jeddah, and  m  1860 concerted  measures were taken bythe Creat Powers to protect Christians in Syria.10  In the protocol signed by  l^0^6Go^ley&apos;Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, and  Turkey at Paris  on  the  jui&apos;y 19,&apos;i860.3rd August, 1860,  relative to the restoration of tranquillity  in Syria and  theprotection of Christians, it was formally stated that no Power sought  or would seek any exclusive influence in  the fulfilment of their obligations.17    In  the  w state Papers,same year  M. Thouvenal declared that  France had  no  wish to  act  single-  vol. li, p. 279.handed in  any question arising in the East.13   In 1868 19 Mgr. Valerga, spiritual  18 Lord (Jowley,head of the Catholics at Jerusalem and in Syria, is said to  have stated  that     9gg&apos; ^the  French  authorities seemed far more desirous of imposing their protection  19 ^ Elliotthan were the heads of the Catholics of receiving it.                           jj0j jgQ   &apos;     European recognition of French rights  is claimed to have been  accorded  May 12, 1868.by article 62  of the  Treaty of Berlin in 1878 ; but it  would appear that these rights were limited to the Holy Places.  The article  states  that &quot; le droit deprotection officielle est reconnu  aux  agents  diplomatiques  et consuiaires  despuissances  en Turquie,  tant a 1&apos;egard  des personnes susmentionnees 20  que  20 j.e.  u jesde leurs etablissements  religieux,  de bienfaisance et autres  dans les Lieux  ecclesiastiques,Saints  et  ailleurs.&quot;21   This would  seem to establish sufficiently  clearly the  les pelerins, et lea.equality of the Powers in regard  to Christians in  Turkey.   The reservation  slg^te Paperswhich is claimed to override  the above statement is  as follows: &quot; Les droits  vol. lxix, p. 767.&apos;acquis a la  France  sont expressement reserves, et il est bien entendu qu&apos;aucuneatteinte ne saurait etre portee au  statu quo dans les Lieux Saints.&quot; 21   Theview  that  this reservation  applied exclusively to the Holy Places,  as wouldappear from the  wording, is further supported by protocol  12 of  the  seanceof the 4th  July, 1878, in which  it  is stated &quot; M. Waddington .... croitdevoir rappeler les droits  acquis a la  France, et fait  observer, d&apos;ailleurs,  quedes  reserves  expresses ont  ete presentees  par  son  Gouvernement,  avant lareunion du  Congres,  en ce qui concerne les Lieux Saints.&quot; 22                    33 State Papers,     The  French rights  of protection in  the Holy Places  have  not been  voi-lxix. P&apos; 1011..disputed, but  it  has been generally held that a monopoly of protection  overLatins in Turkey, irrespective of nationality, is not conferred upon France byany  treaty.   The  French  claim  to  such  a monopoly  has, moreover, been successfully challenged on several occasions.  In 1880 the right of protectionof an  Italian  priest  was declared  by the Porte  to belong both to the Frenchand  to the  Italian  consul.23  When  a similar question  arose  in  1902  the  23 Consul Moore,Ottoman  Council  of State  decided  that the right  of  protection  belonged  Jerusalem,  No. 3,exclusively to the  Italian consul.21   On the occasion  of the pilgrimage of  -february 26i1880.Italian Catholics to the Holy Land in 1902 the Italian, and not the French,  2i Sir N. Q&apos;0onor,lconsul-general took charge of the ceremonial connected  with the visit.  This  ^ ^0,       episode was regarded in Catholic circles as a practical  refutation of the French   ay  &apos;claim to a monopoly  of the right to protect  Latins in the East.     Considerable importance has been attached  to the  circular published onthe 22nd May, 1888, by La Sainte Congregation  de la Propagande,  and to  theletter  written  on the 1st  August, 1898, by Leo XIII  to Cardinal  Langenieux.The circular declared that the Austro-Hungarian or French protectorate shouldbe carefully maintained wherever they respectively existed, and these instruc-       [898-111]                               &quot;                   D

Thebecame later a matter of keen discussion in France.     By the Mitylene Agreement  between  France and Turkey in 1901 Francesecured the  formal recognition by Imperial firman  of all her religious andcharitable institutions in Turkey.25  Similar recognition was accorded in 1902to Russian  schools  in  Syria, and when the  French Ambassador expresseddispleasure at this concession the Ottoman Foreign Minister replied that it wasthe  direct consequence of the action  taken by France, and that  it was nowimpossible to refuse either to the Russians or to others what had been grantedto that Power.26   Later in the same year similar privileges were extended toGermany,27  and  early in  1903  an  Irade was issued  granting correspondingrecognition to British religious and charitable establishments.28     The anti-clerical policy pursued by France since 1901, and the withdrawal by the French Government in  1904 of their Ambassador to the Yatican, hadan effect prejudicial to French influence over Roman Catholics in the East.  Ina speech made in the Chamber on the 4th April, 1905, M. Bienvenu Martin,Ministre de  Cultes, declared  that the  French  religious protectorate,   beingindependent of the  good-will  of the Pope,  was not affected by the separationbetween Ciiurch and State in  France, or by the strained relations between theFrench Government and that- Vatican.   This view was subsequently challenged by &quot; Le Temps,&quot;29 winch pointed  out  that  the French protectorate could notbe based upon the Capitulations in view of  the analogous rights conferred  by treaty on  other Powers,  but had been  exercised as a result of  agreement withthe Vatican.     From  1904  a growing  desire was evinced  by  Italian missionaries  inTurkey to  apply for protection  to  the Italian  rather  than to the french ambassador.   In  1904  the  Salesians,30 and  in  1905  the  Franciscans  in constantinople,30 and les Peres Conventuels31 exchanged  French  for Italianprotection.   On the 27th January, 1907, the  Prefect  Apostolic of the  roman catholic Mission  in Tripoli of  Barbary, in accordance with  orders  receivedfrom  the  Vatican, formally notified the French  Consul-General of the  with-drawal by the Pope of the protectorate hitherto exercised by  France over the catholic Missions in Tripolitania,  and  of its  transfer  to Italy.32   A  list was published in the French  press of institutions in the Turkish Empire which  byagreement between  France and  Italy had been transferred from the protectionof the former to  that of the latter State.33     The  growing political and  commercial  activity  of Germany  in  AsiaticTurkey, combined with Russian religious and educational effort  among theOrthodox Greeks of Syria, revived French  interest among Roman  Catholicsin the East.   In 1911   it was reported that there  were many  flourishingCatholic communities in Syria, all glorying in the protection of France, andthat  the  French  consular authorities openly and  untiringly supported thePapal campaign under  the form of  religion or  of  education.34   Doubtless,in  consequence  of French  interest,  the  Italian   Government  in   1913issued an  official  contradiction  of  the  report  that  Italy   intended  toassume the protectorate over Roman Catholics  in  the East in the place ofFrance.35     It would appear that the protection of Christians in Turkey has been forsome centuries a matter of  concern  to the Christian  Powers  of Europe.Reference has been made to this  question,  often  in exactly similar terms, inthe  principal treaties concluded  between the different Powers and the Porte,and although in  1856 the legal  necessity for foreign protection was abolished,in practice the Powers continued to assist their co-religionists in the OttomanDominions.   There  is abundant evidence of  repeated British intervention  onbehalf of Christians of   all  denominations, and  members  of the  Protestantcommunities looked particularly  to  England and America for  support and protection.     Interests other than religious have been involved in the protection  ofthe Orthodox and Latin Churches.   The French  Government have subsidisedvarious religious and educational institutions in Syria and Palestine belongingnot only to Roman Catholics,  but also to Greek Catholics and Maronites, andFrench protection was  accorded to certain Latin monasteries, convents, and schools in which  the  members  were  of  varied  nationalities.315   Mr.  Malet
reported  that  during his residence  in Constantinople he  had &quot; daily proof$?f. the French  Government  making  use of the  Roman Catholic religionfor  their political  aims,&quot;37  and  it  is  this  political  significance  of  the 37 Mr. Malet,religious  protectorate that  has made the  question  of monopoly  of vital ^^g^er ll&quot;5&apos;importance.                                                               jg7q       &apos;                                                         S. FERRIER.     Foreign Office,          July 30, 1918.APPENDIX  II.                         NOTES  ON ARMENIAN MASSACRES.    The following  notes on  Armenian massacres  which took place between April and august 1915, were supplied  by  an eye-witness,  Lieutenant Tewfik  Dumlussi, of thefirst Turkish expeditionary division, which was under the command of Khalil Pasha, anuncle of Enver Bey.  Lieutenant Dumlussi was present at massacres in Roumia,  Dilman,Shinoa, Yan, Bitiis, Za&apos;art, and Akhlat.    He stated  that, during the operations of his division in Persia it was accompaniedby a band of some 500 comitadjis, Turks and Kurds, led by a certain Asian Bey, whoseone duty was to slaughter Armenians.  The comitadjis killed the men first, then thewomen and children ; after which their dwellings were looted and burnt.  At one place,Gavar, a small village on the Turco-Persian frontier, Asian received the order to kill allArmenians.   The men were  first driven  outside the village and shot in batches, andand then the women and children were  massacred, the offer of the  women to becomeMoslems being rejected.    In  May 1915, on moving west, Khalil dispensed with the services of the comitadjis,preferring to make use of his own soldiers.    A regiment was sent to Za&apos;art with orders to kill the Armenians,  who were shot ona hill  outside the town; two  days later, when Lieutenant Dumlussi marched past thishill, he  saw that it was strewn with Armenian corpses.    On his way to Bitiis  he  saw a party of Armenian  women, escorted by gendarmes.A woman with  two children was unable to keep up with the rest, so a gendarme took upthe elder child  and  killed it by striking its head against a rock, then he took the babyby  the legs and split it in two, and finally killed the mother by striking her on the headwith the butt of his rifle.    At Bitiis  large bodies  of Armenians, after being thrown into wide  trenches, were shot at close  range; the trenches were then filled up,  and all who had not  been killedoutright buried alive.    After  leaving Bitiis, Khalil carried out the massacres systematically.  He  sentdetachments of 250  men to the various villages, with instructions to  destroy them andto kill all the Armenians living therein.     Khalil further ordered that a number of influential  Armenians should be  hanged :forty  were so hanged on telegraph poles in the camp outside Bitiis.    The massacres were not confined to  the civilian population :  officers and  men serving in the Turkish army were murdered solely because they were  Armenians.   Twoofficers and  250  men in  Dumlussi&apos;s  division were so shot, without  trial, by  order ofKhalil  Pasha.   Armenian prisoners of war,  too, even  when  Russian  subjects,  wereinvariably shot.o
