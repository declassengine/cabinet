Peace Proposals. The People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Tchitcherin,  hassent the following note  to  the  Latvian and  Lithuanian Governments  (Moscow, 12thSeptember) :   .    The  Russian  Soviet Republic  has already approached the  Reval government about the commencement of peace negotiations; this proposal  was accepted, and  thepeace negotiations will  begin within a few days.  This step on the part of the russian soviet Republic points  to  the absence - of  any  aggressive  intentions  towards  the newly formed States  on the borderland of the former Russian  Empire.  It thereforeinvites  the  Riga  and  Lithuanian Governments  to  commence negotiations  for  the suspension of hostilities  and the working out of peace terms by both parties.    A Russian wireless  report of the 13th September  contains the following announce-ment:     The Soviet Government has approached the small States on the north-westernfrontier which have lately been at war with Russia with a view to entering into peacenegotiations  with them.   Notes  containing peace proposals have not only been sent tothe White  Esthonian  Government,  which  has  already consented   to  open  peacenegotiations, but also to the Finnish Bourgeois Government, the  Government of the lithuanian Tariba, and.  the Riga Bourgeois Government.  It is not for the first time that  the  Soviet Government has&apos; approached  its  enemies with a view to concludingan armistice  or signing peace.  It has never  striven, and does not  strive, for conquest.It  has  never  begun, and has  no intention  of beginning, any  kind of  aggressive action towards  the Allied Powers.   The war  was forced upon Soviet Russia  by herenemies.  We were  forced to  fight  in  order to  defend ourselves from  the  furiousonslaughts organised by the Allied Imperialists and the Russian White Guards,  but wehave  always  been in  favour of peace,  provided  that it would in no way be  detrimental to  the  achievements of the  Workmen&apos;s and Peasants&apos;  Authority,  or weaken  theposition  of  the  Soviet  Government.  When approaching  the Governments  of thePowers which are fighting against us, we first of all appeal  to  the  proletariat  andpeasants of such States.  We know that they are on our side.   Of course the BourgeoisGovernments themselves, while realising that their services to the British  Governmentare insufficiently rewarded, would hardly dare to conclude  a stable peace with us.   The       [896]                           &quot;                                    B
British Fleet is still in the Baltic Sea.   But among the workmen of Finland, Lithuania,and Courland our appeal should meet with a response.    The Esthonian Government adopted a peaceful attitude when once the  workmenof Esthonia had clearly expressed their  wishes.  We  can rest assured that  now theworkmen of these countries will put pressure on their  leaders and  force them to ceaseoperations  against Soviet  Bussia.  Churchill  declared  that  at the end  of Augustfourteen  Powers would attack Soviet Russia.   We laughed at this  announcement, as experience has  already proved  that we,  and  not  the  British  Imperialist,  are inthe right.    No joint attack has taken place.   More than this, several of the Powers which were intended to fight  against us are in reality ready  to  begin peace negotiations.   the plans of Allied  Imperialism  are collapsing.  Our policy is  not based on an alliance of governments, with the object of annexation and conquest, like the Imperialists, but onthe close brotherhood  of the working masses.   Consequently our  alliance will be farstronger, and our allies far more reliable.                                                    (Signed)       KERJEMTSEFF.    The Food  Crisis. The following instructions have been issued for dealing withthe distribution of food (Russian wireless, 9th September) :     The most effective measure for dealing with the  food crisis  is to invite workmen&apos;organisations to participate  directly in the national work of collecting surplus grain.For this  purpose the Soviet of People&apos;s  Commissaries, on the 4th  September, adopted the following system  of  rewarding workmen  of grain  supply  detachments.  Everyworkman of an enterprise  which  has organised  grain  supply  detachments  receives20 lb. of grain,  and every workman with a big family receives 30 lb. of grain.  Theserewards  will be issued five times during the  work of the  grain supply detachment.Thus  every workman by the  time the  detachment  has  finished  its work  will havereceived  2\ poods of grain,  and  every workman with  a  big family 3f-poods  of-grain.Workmen employed in the  detachments will at the  same period receive 2^-  poods of grain  each.   Workmen&apos;s organisations are directly affected by the success of  the  foodcampaign.   The People&apos;s Food  Supply Commissariat  and  the Central Soviet  of TradeUnions  suggest therefore to all Soviets  of Trade  Unions, to all Factory and WorksCommittees,  to all Food Supply  Centres and Committees  for Waterways that theyshould immediately form the greatest possible number  of detachments of the  best  andmost energetic workers, to be sent  to the  grain-producing Governments.   The speedydespatch of food  supplies to the starving Governments depends on  the work of  theworkmetfs grain detachments.                                      TsYiRYUPA,People&apos;s Food Supply Commissary.                                      TOMSKI, President of the  All-Russian Central                                              Soviet of Trade Unions.                                      KOZIREEF,  President  of  the  Military Food                                        Supply Bureau attached to the All-Russian                                        Central Soviet of Trade Unions.    A Bolshevik Writer on  Denikin&apos;s Regime, Vardin in  an article published in  the&quot; Pravda,&quot; makes the following statement:  &quot; Several armies are fighting against us in thesouth the Volunteer Army, the Don Army, the Kuban Army, and the Caucasian Army.These forces are united from  a military point  of view and, according to the Whites,they are  under &apos;the  general  guidance&apos;  of Denikin&apos;s headquarters, or  the  so-called&apos; headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief in South  Russia.&apos;   However, all these armiesdo not belong  to one country, each one of them represents  an  &apos; independent&apos; State.The most powerful of  Denikin&apos;s  armies  is the  Volunteer Army formed by Kornilov,Alekseev, and Denikin.  It consists of former officers and cadets, and a purely bourgeoisdiscipline  is being supported  by reactionary  youths.    Generals  and landownersare  playing an  important part.  Denikin&apos;s  present Government   consists of  thefollowing members : General Lukomsky, President; Vinaver, the Cadet Party leader  ;Krivoshein, the  Tsarist Minister ;  Piltz,  former Assistant  to Protopopov, Minister ofthe.Interior.  In fact, all the above members represent the same classes and  parties as before, i,e., a combination of landowners and reactionary elements.   The second placein the ranks of our enemies  is occupied by  the Kuban Army.   It is headed by Tsaristgenerals  who work in conjunction with Denikin.  However, the lower  classes are ingreat opposition to the latter.   The Don  Cossacks at present  are quite exhausted asthey have suffered considerable losses.&quot;   (Russian wireless, September 12th.)
CENTRAL ASIA.     Military  Situation :  (1)  Afghan and  Persian Frontiers. A telegram from the&quot;Viceroy of India (September 10th) sums up the military situation as affecting possibleBolshevik operations towards Persia and Afghanistan.   The Bolshevik force in Turkestanis of low moral, and in view of the lack of reinforcements and rolling-stock, the severity ofthe winter, and the. hostility of the Bokharans and other elements  of the  Turkestanpopulation, it cannot.carry out any extensive  military operations.  Moreover, it doesnot appear likely that the Afghans would welcome Bolshevik intervention involving an advance into their country.     So long as Petsia remains friendly, an invasion in that direction is equally difficult.Apart from difficulties of transport, the route via Askabad  and Kuchan  is protected byGeneral Malleson&apos;s force, while the alternative  route via Krasnovodsk and Asterabad isdominated by British  control  of the  Caspian.   The  evacuation of the  Caucasus,however, and the loss of command of the Caspian  Sea might react on Persia and  wouldgive the Bolsheviks freedom of access to the Persian coast.     As long as a British force is maintained  in Khorasan and the  British command the caspian the Bolsheviks  will probably confine themselves to  intensive propaganda.     (2) Kolchak&apos;s Front. According to a wireless report from Moscow (16th September),the junction  of the Red troops on  the Turkestan and Tashkent fronts has been effected.The Orenburg-Tashkent road is clear ; the railway line  intact.   Co-operation betweenthe local populations and the Reds is reported everywhere.   Kolchaks Southern Army,operating in this  neighbourhood, has, during the last few days, been completely routed.The Bolsheviks claim to have taken over 45,000 prisoners and an enormous quantity of stores and military supplies.  According to supplementary information Soviet cavalryhave occupied the  stations Dzburin and Emba on the Tashkent Railway, taking over,000 prisoners and much booty.   On 13th September they advanced on to the stationMougoumzharsk,  190 versts south  of  Aktiubinsk, where they met  the advanced guardsof tbe Tashkent Red troops.     Economic value of  Turkestan. Russian wireless  of the 17th  September contains the following message :      Turkestan has been united to  Soviet Russia.  Before us is the wide and open wayto a country rich in cotton, furs, and fruits.   The union with Turkestan means thatall the great  factories standing idle in  Shui,  Ivanovo-Vosnesensk  and Vladimir,  owing-to lack of cotton,  will begin work again.  It means that at  last the workmen, peasants,and Bed soldiers can be properly clad.  It means that  if we go to the peasants for grainnow  at  least we shall not  go  empty-handed.&apos;   But  the cotton must  be brought,and our transport is in a critical position.   We must  work with greater energy, with greater vigour to improve  the transport.   We  must understand that every  truckrepaired, every engine in working order will bring nearer the time when we  can  profitby these riches.   .  Bolshevik Propaganda. The  following message  has  been  sent  frohi  Tashkent to moscow by the President of the Mussulman Regional Bureau (10th September) :      The Central  Bureau  of the  Mussulman  organisation  attached to the RussianCommunist Party.To the People&apos;s Commissariat for Nationalities.     In view  of the  fact that communication  between Turkestan  and  Central  russia will soon be re-established, and in view of the lack of experienced Mussulman  Partyworkers in Turkestan, which has a bad  effect on the organisation and political develop-ment of the Mussulman proletariat of the Turkestan Republic and of the East generally,the Regional Mussulman Party Bureau requests  you to send to Tashkent the greatest possible  number  of  Mussulman  Party workers and organisers  and  also Socialistliterature in the Mussulman language as soon as communications have been re-estab-lished.  Also please  send  a Mussulman printing press, paper and other publishingaccessories, as the lack of these delays the work.     The Commissariat for Nationalities is of great  importance  in  Turkestan ; it- isnecessary for the  Commissariat,  for  Nationalities  to  pay great  attention to  this organisation and  to send experienced workers  and instructors to the Commissariat forNationalities in Tashkent.B 2
                                    ARMENIA.     The British Withdrawal. On the 12th September Mr. Wardrop (Tiflis) received a visit from M. de Khatissian, the Armenian  Prime Minister.  The latter stated that the prestige of the Paris Conference had suffered  considerably owing to the decision  to withdraw the British troops from Transcaucasia.  He  suggested that Grea,t Britain should send  a strong military mission to Erzeroum to  control Turkish action against Armenia.   The  Armenians. might  resist Turkish aggression for a few months, but ultimately they must depend on the  assistance of one  of the Great  Powers, and the Power they preferred was Great Britain.  Pie insisted upon the complete separation of Russia and the trans caucasian Republics, since Russia had always shown her  unfitness to govern  other races.   He  mistrusted the Azerbaijan Government as supporting Turkish aggression.     In a despatch to Mr. Balfour, dated the  11th September, His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs recalled the course of events  in Armenia.   He alluded  to the  mixed feelings with which the British  troops were  originally received,  the general dismay at the prospect of their withdrawal, and the breakdown of the  negotiations for their replacement  by Italian or American  troops.  Finally, on the 31st August, Lord Curzon received a visit from Colonel  Rawlinson, who stated that he had been sent by General Milne to Jay the full facts before His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   He  represented that the  western  neighbours  of the  Armenian Republic were  only waiting for the moment when the last of the British  troops should have left  to  invade that State and exterminate  the entire Christian population, and that the Armenians were  not in a position to offer any resistance.                                    GEORGIA.     Bolshevik Activity. Mr. Wardrop reported on the 12th September that an attempt had been made by  a Bolshevik agent at Tiflis to assassinate General Odishelidze, the commander-in-chief of the Georgian Army, and Denikin&apos;s representative, General Saratov. At the same time a message was received  from Baku stating that the house belonging to General Denikin&apos;s Mission  had been blown  up by bombs.   These outrages were deprecated by Georgians ot all  classes, and numerous arrests of Bolsheviks were being made.     Mussulman Deputation  from  Batoum,- On the 14th September Mr.  Wardrop telegraphed   that  he  had  received  a Mussulman deputation  from Batoum.   The deputation protested against the administration of the town by Denikin&apos;s supporters who, they asserted, carried on intrigues against the native population.   They had drawn up  a petition  requesting that the administration  should be  handed   over  to the representatives of the people, who had already elected a Mejlis.                                   BULGARIA.     The Elections. In two despatches, dated 24th  August  and 1st September, Sir H. Lamb discusses, the results &quot;of the recent  elections to  the  National  Assembly.  The parties  stand as follows: Agrarians, 85;  Narrow -Socialists or &quot;Communists,&quot; 47; Broad Socialists, 39 ; Democrats, 28 ;  Nationalists, 19 ; various Liberal Parties, 18.     The predominant element in the new  Chamber will  therefore be the Agrarians, whose forces are almost doubled ; while the Liberal Parties, which  formed  the basis  of the  Radoslavist majority in the last Chamber  with a  combined strength of some 110 votes, are entirely eliminated.  M.  Theodorof (Nationalist) will now probably  face the new Chamber at the head  of  a fresh  coalition, comprising  his own  party (19), the Agrarians (85),  the Democrats f28), the Radicals (8), and the  Tzancovists (8),  while the   two  mutually irreconcilable  sections  of  the  Socialists   will   constitute  the Opposition.     Other  features to which Sir H.  Lamb draws  attention  are  (l)the  probable emergence of M. Stamboulijsky (Agrarian)  as the preponderating power  in  the new Government;  (2)  the unexpected accession of  strength to  the Socialists;   (3) the dependence  of  the political situation on the peace terms;  (4)  the  almost complete disappearance of the Mussulman element from the Chamber.     The limitation of Mussulman representation has  been due  in the past to  skilful manipulation of the  electoral system.   On  this occasion, however, the abstention of the Mussulman  electors  from  voting was  due  to instructions received  from  the Central Thracian Committee in Constantinople, who hoped thereby to emphasise their demandfor the autonomy of Thrace under the protection of one of the great Powers.
     Sir H.  Lamb  considers that their abstention will be  interpreted merely  as an expression of dissatisfaction with the existing regime, and will tend  to  strengthen thequite unfounded pretension of the Greeks that the  Turkish population would prefertheir rule to that of the Bulgarians.     The Bulgarian authorities, however, have committed an  even greater blunder byarresting three of the late Mussulman deputies on the charge of inciting their voters to abstain,  and by thus alienating the sympathies  of a  large (500,000) and importantsection of the population.                                   RUMANIA.     Resignation of the-Government. Mr. Rattigan telegraphed on the  12th Septemberthat the Bratiano  Ministry had resigned.   He learns  tha,t  the  King  is experiencingconsiderable  difficulty in persuading M. Maniu to form a  Government.   M.  Maniucannot accept the clauses in the Austrian Treaty  dealing with foreign  minorities, andtherefore feels unable to take office on the basis of giving his signature to the Treaty.                                   POLAND.     Concessions to Great Britain. Sir  P. Wyndham reported on the 12th Septemberthat the Polish Government had granted to Great Britain concessions for the constructionof a harbour at Danzig and railways in Poland.     Propaganda. The Minister  for Foreign Affairs has informed  Sir P. Wyndhamthat Badek, who has recently been in Berlin, has engineered  an agreement between theSoviet and German Governments for the carrying out of propaganda in  Poland.                                     SYRIA.     Syrian Aspirations. According to a telegram from Colonel Meinertzhagen (Cairo),the Syrian Union  Committee has formulated the following requests :  (t) the formationof a National Government, (2) the recognition of the Congress now sitting in Damascusas a Constituent Assembly,  (3) a general election under the auspices of the Assembly,(4) authority for the Assembly to send a delegation to Paris to defend the rights of the syrian people.     Colonel Meinertzhagen reports that at a meeting between himself, Emir Feisal, andM. Laforcade on  the 9th  September,  a frank  exchange of views took place.  Feisalinsists that a united Syria extending from Gaza to the Taurus Mountains is vital.   Heis willing to accept the agreement of  1918,  which he interprets  as complying  with (Syrian wishes iri regard  to  the unity  of the  country and the  choice of  a mandatoryPower.   His ultimate aim is an Arab Federation embracing Mesopotamia and  a JewishPalestine under a British mandate, and  he is absolutely opposed to the French.  Ratherthan see  the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement carried out without the wishes of thepeople being consulted he will renounce his loyalty to Great Britain and devote himself to the realisation of national independence.     The French local attitude is based on the fulfilment of the Sykes-Picot Agreement.The French are contemptuous of the Arabs, desire  immediate occupation of the country by French troops, and accuse the British  of anti-French propaganda.   M. Laforcadehimself is suspicious of British intentions.     Military Occupation. It has been  decided by the Allied and Associated Govern-ments, at a meeting held in Paris oh the 15th September, that as a temporary expedientthe British army in Syria and Cilicia, west of  the  Sykes-Picot line, is to be replaced by french troops.     The Secretary of the War Cabinet has issued a Memorandum  (18/Q/252)  giving a  summary of, the proceedings in Paris in regard to the military occupation in Syria,Cilicia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.                                    ARABIA.     Colonel Jacobs&apos; Mission. The officer commanding  troops at  Hodeidah transmits  along telegram from Colonel Jacob to Lord Allenby.   The Quhra Sheikhs still objectto  Colonel Jacob  and his  mission proceeding to  Sanaa, and continue to hold  themprisoners.  The head Sheikh, Abu Hadi, who is  nominally  Imams governor of Bajil,is friendly, and has taken charge of the missions rifles and money.   Meanwhile, Imam
is treating with the Quhra for the mission&apos;s release, but cannot agree to the settlementof certain outstanding differences between  himself and the Sheikhs.  The situation is rendered more complicated by the fact that the Quhra  are believed to be working withthe Abu tribe  to form a Shafei Hoc  in opposition to  Imam, who is a Zaidi.   In con-sequence of this Imam may have resort to arms.    Colonel Jacob thinks  that the Quhra will  demand as conditions for the mission&apos;srelease (1) the evacuation of  Hodeidah, (2) guarantees against encroachment  by theZaidis, (3) a money grant.                                    PERSIA.    Opposition to the Agreement. Following upon the unfriendly communique issuedby the American Legation at Teheran the Prime Minister has received a telegram fromthe Persian Minister in Washington stating that a certain section of the American pressis strongly opposed to the  Agreement.    The  French Legation  has also  issued  a communique  stating that the  FrenchGovernment is  prepared to place a French vessel at the disposal of the  Persian PeaceDelegation for  its  journey from Batoum to Constantinople, and that it has conferredthe Legion of Honour on  Munshaver, who is actively  hostile  to  the  Agreement (sir percy Cox, September 11th and 15th).                                AFGHANISTAN.    The Peace.- On 11th September the  Viceroy telegraphed  that, according to areport  from Kabul, the Amir had written  to  Persia  and to the  Amir of Bokhara,announcing the conclusion of peace.  He  had  also instructed the  frontiersmen thathostilities were  to cease.   The  news  was  received   with  enthusiasm by  theBokhara merchants.  In Kandahar, however, it was rumoured that war  would breakout again.    This feeling of uncertainty is confirmed by General Malleson,  who states that theHerat merchants have no real belief in the permanency of peace, and are holding up thesupplies which are normally sent to Meshed.    Anti-British propaganda is being  carried on in Bokhara and Samarkand on behalfof the Afghans (General Malleson, 9th September).
