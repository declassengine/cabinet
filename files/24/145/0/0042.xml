On the 2nd January Mr. Alston sent [No. 9]the following report on the situation in Moscow and  Petrograd  based on information which, he said, might be regarded as authentic.     The whole population of Moscow, exclusive of the Bolsheviks, is terrorised almostto a point of imbecility and physical paralysis.   Three-quarters of the people are slowlystarving to  death slender supplies of  even the simplest food are  only  to be  had whenthe watch of the Bolshevik guard weakens, and hoarders  see  their chance  to realiseenormous profits at the expense of the poor.  Long queues wait  throughout the daylighthours, perhaps for the sake of getting a bit  of fish, potatoes, or half a pound of  tea, forwhich they may have to pay anything up to 100 roubles a  pound.  Sugar is 50  roublesa  pound  when  obtainable, and  coarse  black bread  varies from  15 to 25  roubles,dependent upon the  section of the town in which  it is  sold.  A suit of second-handclothes will fetch anything up to [? 2,000] roubles, and a pair of boots 800 roubles.  Themainstay of the population at present is horseflesh, but supplies of that are  dwindlingfast.   Shortly after Lenhfs attempted  assassination,  500  hostages  were  taken  toKronstadt  for  reprisals and  subjected  to  most  horrible  tortures.  The people  arecowering in their cellars, numbed with cold, and very often preferring  to starve ratherthan risk torture at  the  hands  of the  Lettish and Chinese hooligans who form the&quot;militia&quot; on  the streets.   The  &quot;intellectuals,&quot;  to  avoid extermination, have  largelygone into the service of the Bolsheviks, receiving &quot;labour books&quot; in lieu of time-sheets.They get insignificant wages compared with even  the  camp followers of the  Bolshevikgarrisons, who at any rate get fed. fairly regularly.     In July  all  officers  w^ere  ordered to  report  to the  Alexandrovsku school  for registration, and about 20,000 appeared.   They were shut  up  for three days withoutfood, sleep,  or air, many going mad;  those  who attempted to  escape when they were finally let out were mercilessly bayonettecl by the Chinese and Lettish guard.       [756]-18                                                            B
     The  area  round Butirsku  prison has  been  abandoned by residents, owing towindows shaking with the rifle fire involved in  the numerous  executions of &quot; counter-revolutionary intellectuals.&quot;     Tuberculosis  and  typhoid are  increasing  every  day,  and medical supplies areutterly unprocurable, even at the most outrageous prices, by  the ordinary population.  .     Infants have been nationalised, and  upon attaining the age of 18 become theproperty of the State.     The  situation in  Petrograd is  better  militarily, owing to its ceasing to be theBolshevik headquarters,  although it virtually  ran  with blood after the  murder ofUritsku, the Bolshevik commissary.  The death roll from disease is much higher owingto there being  even less food than in  Moscow, and also to the fact of the dead bodies of horses, dogs, and even human beings, lying  about for days in the streets.     All the canals are  polluted with decomposed  bodies  of  men and animals, andcholera took a  very heavy toll in summer.     On the Yiborg side things are considerably  better, but the Bolsheviks take goodcare that  no food gets  to the &quot;bourgeoisie &quot; from the  Finland  side, although they get it themselves.     The whole population of Petrograd  may be  considered to be virtually insane,  ifnot hunger-stricken, and unable to appreciate the possibility of the utter exterminationof the educated elements, as  the people do in Moscow though  they have suffered less.There is no doubt that the Bolsheviks will  be forced to kill  off the greater [? part ofthe] population ultimately, to release and  provide food for themselves and their armies.A horrible massacre is possible  at any moment in any of the big towns.     The Bolshevik Army. On the  16th November  Sir George Barclay transmitted[No. 488] a message from the military attache at Jassy which only reached the ForeignOffice on  the 7th  January.  The  military  attache reported that the Bolshevik  army was well organised and had many well-known regular officers on its staff.  Reports saidthat it amounted to 1,000,000 well disciplined men.UKRAINE.     The  Directorate.- Telegraphing  from  Odessa   on the   6th  January [No.  2],Mr. Bagge reported a split  in  the directorate, which was only formed a month or soago.   M.  Vinnichenko, he said, favoured  an agreement with the Bolsheviks, to which m. Patlura was nominally opposed, though  his  declarations were practically Bolshevikin character  and  his troops  largely so.   The Hetman&apos;s Government, which was set up under German  auspices, was overthrown by MM. Petlura and Vinnichenko in agreementwith the Germans, who were now opposed to the former of these two.SIBERIA.    Sir  Charles   Eliot&apos;s appreciation  of  the  Situation.&apos; On  the  31st DecemberMr. Alston telegraphed [No.  387] the following appreciation of the  general situation bySir  Charles Eliot,  the high commissioner :     The prestige of the  Koltchak Government has  been increased by the capture ofPerm.  This, too,  has  shown that  the Siberian army can  behave creditably  in newsurroundings ;  but there is a general agreement that the troops behind the front could notbe trusted to keep order in any  town in which they were in contact with the Bolsheviksfor  any length of time.     The Koltchak Government has the support of  the military officers, but this has itsdisadvantages.   As a class, they are reactionaries  and to a great extent monarchists,and so the Government becomes identified with  principles much less liberal  than  thosewhich it professes; whereas,  should  it either curb military  licence or show any liberaltendencies it might lose the support of the  officers.   The moderate parties, includingthe cadets, also support the new Government.     The  moderate sections of the Social Revolutionaries had  agreed to support it, the murder, however, of the members of the constituent assembly during the recent risingat Omsk  produced a  deplorable effect;  but Koltchak might  bring  about dangerousill-feeling in  his entourage if he  punished the culprits.     The Cossack troops of Orenburg and  Western  Siberia are supporters  of Koltchak;those of Trans-Baikal and ITsuri, who have grown up independently of Western  Siberianinfluence,  refuse to recognise  him their principal leader is Semenoff.  Horvat nominallysupports him in the East, but Sir Charles  Eliot does not think that he can be depended upon:  he is believed to be in Japanese pay.
       The peasantry, especially in districts where they have had experience of Bolshevism,   are probably opposed  to the  Bolsheviks.   But on. the one hand they dislike military   service and the paying of taxes and on the other like to distil spirits as they choose aud   to cut wood in the government forests; so when  they have a grievance they listen to   the Bolsheviks and&apos;join  their bands.       The Czechs were  partisans of Aksentieff, but the majority of them consider the   defeat of Bolshevism as  a matter of greater  importance  than the establishment of any   particular  form of government in Russia : for that object and for  that  object only they   are ready to co-operate with Koltchak.  At present their relations with  Russians are not   very good.       In addition to  the difficulties already noted the Koltchak  Government must count   upon a period of Japanese hostility.   The Japanese consider that Siberia is too large to   be administered by one Government under its present conditions ;  and that, consequently   the  Omsk  Government  should confine itself to the West, whilst Horvat  and  SemenofF   should have the East.   This would mean the creation of a Japanese sphere.       Everything  considered, it is impossible to regard the Koltchak Government as a   strong one.       Economically  the  situation  is  very  bad.   There  is  a shortage of  everything   but  simple foodstuffs :   they  are abundant, and that alone prevents  the distress from   being  as serious as  might be expected.   With the warm  weather serious  epidemics are   expected typhus is already prevalent.       Admiral Koltchak. On the 2nd January Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 6] a message   [No. 5] from the high commissioner dated the 1st January.   Sir Charles Eliot reported   that Admiral  Kokchak  was  ill, suffering it was said, from slight pneumonia.   He  had   been ill for three weeks,  and would probably remain in bed for another fortnight.   For   practical purposes, he was not at present head of the Government;  should there be any   trouble, the Government  could not forecast the  attitude of  the monarchists  and   reactionary officers, but so long as things were quiet there was no special  danger in the   situation.       Koltchak and Semenoff. On the 4th January Mr. Alston reported [No. 18] to the   Foreign Office a telegram which he had that same  day sent to Sir Charles Eliot [No. 6].   Mr. Alston said  that he had had a conversation with the Japanese  agent  and  had   informed him that,  in the opinion of Sir Charles  Eliot, as Admiral  Koltchak was sick,   the moment was opportune  for a  reconciliation between  him  and  Semenoff.   The   Japanese agent had promised that he  would do  what he could to bring  this about,   adding that, after the reconciliation, Koltchak must be prevented from giving  Semenoff   orders of too drastic a character to  be obeyed.       Koltchak and Denikin. On the 2nd  January Mr.  Alston transmitted [No.  3] a   telegram dated the 1st  January from  the high commissioner, in turn transmitting a   message for General Denikin from Admiral Koltchak, who hoped that  His Majeaty&apos;sj   Government would  forward  it.  Admiral Koltchak  informed General  Denikin that a   Government had been  formed  with M.   Vologodski as  president  of the council of   ministers,  and  himself  as  governor  and  commander-in-chief for  Siberia,  the  Ural   territory, and the Cossack districts of Ural  and Orenburg : he considered it indispensable   that he and Deuikin should act in unison, and he should communicate with the latter   and him only on all state affairs and military matters.       Telegraphing again  on  the 5th January [No. 20] Mr. Alston said that he had been   informed by the French  high commissioner that a  report had reached Omsk from Paris   to the effect that a  telegram had been received in Paris from  Sazonoff, who was  with   Denikin,  stating that if the allies  wished to recognise the  Koltchak Government&apos;   Denikin was prepared to do the same.       Bolshevik  Rising at  Omsk. Mr. Alston reported on the  31st December [No. 384]I   that the high commissioner  had stated that the Bolshevik rising at Omsk, which theI   British vice-consul in that place had reported on the 22nd December, had  been serious,j   some of the Russian troops siding with the Bolsheviks.  It had been quelled, he said,1   chiefly by the Czechs and Cossacks, and the total  number  killed was  1,000.   It was&apos;1   stated  that  papers had  been found indicating an  intention  to  massacre foreignersI   generally, and in particular the men of the Middlesex regiment.  The Bolsheviks released1   some members  of the constituent assembly, who,  however, when the  disturbance  had         [756]-18                                                        B  2
been quelled, were ordered to return to prison : they obeyed, but six or seven  of  them were killed by Russian officers.   Tbe Government was greatly concerned, but so far hadpunished no one.    The Capture, of Perm. On tbe 5th January Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 19] thefollowing message, dated the  3rd January, from the British  consul at Ekaterinburg: I have just returned  from Perm, which has been taken  by  the Siberian army under General Pepheff.  30,000  prisoners were taken and tremendous booty was captured,&apos;,including  4,000  waggons  and 260  locomotives, 70&apos; per cent, of which was in  workingcondition, 50 guns,  10 armoured  cars,  a great  number  of  automobiles  and  other material not yet counted.   Part of the  4,000 waggons captured  were full  of  everyconceivable domestic material, stolen from the inhabitants,  and loaded for evacuation by the Bolsheviks.   The bridge across  the Kama is intact.   From interviews with thelocal authorities and inhabitants it would appear that the Bolsheviks subjected theinhabitants to horrible repressions and cruelties, especially after the attempt  on Lenin&apos;slife.   I have examined witnesses who found bodies of their relatives killed by bayonetwounds with their   faces  showing  the  marks  of boot nails;  no bullet  marks were found on these bodies.  Instruments used for torturing victims were also found.    Ufa  taken  by  the Bolsheviks. On the  31st December the  town  of  Ufa was.captured by the  Bolsheviks.   This was  reported  by Mr. Alston, on  the  authority  ofSir Charles Eliot, on the 3rd  January [No. 11].                                    POLAND.     The  Pledges  of  the Allied  Governments. On  the  5th  January  Mr. Balfourrequested [No. 50] Lord Derby to instruct Colonel Wade  at Warsaw  that  he mighttell the Polish Government that the allies would be greatly assisted in  their  efforts  to fulfil their pledge to  secure tbe full  recognition of Polish  aspirations at the  peaceconference by the Polish  people showing their fitness for independence by self-controland orderliness.   He should  point out that the Poles  would  seriously  prejudice theircause if they made any attempt to  seize Posen or Silesia before the  peace  conference,as under the armistice the Germans were only required to evacuate such portions  ofPoland as were outside Germany at the outbreak of the war.  In the meantime theallied Governments  would do everything in their power to assist the Poles in  resistingBolshevik invasion, and to secure them from German attack.     Germans and   Bolsheviks. On  the 6th January Lord Kilmarnock  transmitted[No.  53]  a message  from  the British commissioner in  Poland  reporting  that theGermans who were evacuating the  Oberost zone were handing over to  the Bolshevikstheir ammunition and war material.  In reply to protests the Germans asserted  thattheir action was not in conflict with the armistice conditions.     Bolsheviks  in  Warsaw  and Zamose. On  the 2nd  January  [No. 5]  Sir HoraceBumbold reported that M. Zaleski had received a telegram informing him  that on the29th December the Bolsheviks had  attempted  to provoke a revolt in Warsaw.  A mobcollected who, with cries in a Jewish jargon of &quot; Down with Poland,&quot;  &quot; Down  with thePolish army,&quot; moved on the Bruhl palace with the intention of liberating the internedRussian Bolsheviks.   A  Polish detachment  was attacked  and two  ,men  were killed.The Polish troops restored order, killing ten  Bolsheviks and wounding fifty . in theprocess.     At Zamosc, on  the  28th December, a  mob composed  of Bolsheviks and  Jewsattacked the gendarmerie barracks  and disarmed the soldiers ; the rising was suppressedby Polish troops.                                   RUMANIA.     Hostile  Action of the  Serbs. On the  29th. December  Lord Derby transmitted-[No.  1895] a message sent from  Bucharest on  the  27th December,  by  the  french minister,  in regard  to the action of the Serbs  in the Banat, which had  roused theindignation of  the Rumanian  people.   The Rumanian Government  had received atelegram  from Transylvania informing it that hundreds  of  Rumanians  in the  Banathad been taken  by the Serbian army to Belgrade and there interned.   Others had fledin terror and taken  refuge in ...  . which was full of them.
                                     TURKEY.      The Homeless Greeks. On the 1st January  Admiral Webb  reported  [No. 1 ] that-  the repatriation of homeless Greeks was a problem of almost the same magnitude  as the  Armenian question.   In June 1914 over 250,000 Ottoman Greeks were expelled from  Asia Minor into Greece, of whom he understood some 200,000, neariy all destitute, were  still living.1*    During the war half a million  Greeks were driven from their homes in Asia  Minor  and European Turkey and a large  number of villages were destroyed.   The majority  died under their privations as it was intended by the Turks and the Germans that they  should, much in the same way as the Armenians.  Probably some  200,000 were alive,  scattered throughout  the interior  of Asia Minor in a miserable state, and he had been  told by the locum tenens of the Greek patriarch that tbe death-rate was very high.      The patriarchate was forming a committee with the full approval and concurrence of  the acting Greek high commissioner to investigate cases and the means of repatriation, . and had made a personal appeal to him to appoint  one of his staff to act with the  committee.  He had  cordially  agreed, as he felt  that the Greeks would in any case  look to us to assist them with  transport, organization, &amp;c.  and he was  ascertaining  whether  his French,  Italian, and United States  colleagues would also wish  to  be  represented.      As soon as he could get some  officers he intended to send  missions  to the chief  centres to investigate  the condition of the ruined homes and would report agaiD later.  Meanwhile he had started repatriation on a small scale.      Funds, he added, were urgently needed ; the patriarch had  raised 5O,00OZ. (which  he rightly described as a drop in the ocean) and urged that all civilized countries should  be invited to assist.                                     ARMENIA.      The Deported Natives. On the  3rd  January Sir Mark  Sykes reported [No. 64]  that the local Armenian committee had  requested  him to  forward the following  for  His Majesty s Government :       Forty thousand deported Armenian refugees in Aleppo,  heartily  wishing you  all  prosperity in the coming year, beg  to bring to your notice the following facts.  As the  result  of deportation and massacres by the Turks,  thousands of children and girls were  abandoned by the roadside in  Mesopotamia, Jaziraii, and Syria.   These poor creatures,  left to perish by Turks,  were  picked up by  the gentler but  uncivilized Arabs of the  desert and the border, and are still living in the tents and  villages of the  nomads and  the fellaheen.   As a result, large numbers are losing all memory of their race, and some  women and many girls have been obliged to  submit to forced marriage.  We believe  the Entente Powers,  including the Arab Government,  desire the  liberation of these  scattered children of our race, and the release of  these women, who have been forced to  leave their own and  enter another social system.  We earnestly beg the above Powers  to devise some speedy means of bringing this painful situation to  an  end.  The  news  from Urfa and other Armenian  provinces is  revolting; cases of murder, robbery, and  other outrages continue, and  the organisers of massacres, together with the notorious  officers of the gendarmerie of the  Turkish Government still hold official posts.  We  pray for the speedy cessation of Turkish rule in all the provinces,  if you  deem we have  right to live hereafter in peace and safety.                                      SYRIA.      Aintah.-On the  2nd January General Clayton transmitted  [No. 264] a message.  from Sir Mark Sykes [No. 62], who reported that he had  accompanied the commander  of the*5th  cavalry division and M.  Picot to  Aintab.   The town was quieter  but the  OU. P. was still active, and the general warned  the  m-utessariff and notables  in  regard to their personal responsibility in the event of any disorder, and in their presence  he spoke  severely to three leading members of the C.U.P. who  had been particularly  obnoxious.  Since the occupation  of Aintab the C.U.P. has started newspapers, both  in  the town and in Marash, containing  matter calculated  to  provoke the  Turkish  element -to attack the Arabs, the Armenians,  and the Entente.   The CUR. propa-  ganda was now based on the following points :  (1.) The allies will soon quarrel amongst  themselves, and (2) the duty of the Moslems  is to arm, to organize, and  to take the first  opportunity of attacking the A menians.
     Sir Mark went on to  say  that  he believed the Kurdish elements,  it judiciously handled in the Aintab and Marash area would refuse to co-operate with the C.U.P. The- present system of occupation and surveillance by  Entente troops under. the * military authorities here, whilst the administration was run by Constantinople, gave the^Turks and the  C.U.P.  full opportunities of obstruction, intrigue, and preparation,   which would inevitably lead to trouble.  Until  the civil administration was  divorced iVom Constantinople and  put under  Entente authority in all areas where the Entente forces^ were in occupation,  the C.U.P. would continue to  have strong influence.  Up to date,\ the C.U.P. boasted  that it would win out yet.     Two days later General Clayton transmitted  [No. 269]  another message [No. 63]s from Sir Mark Sykes, in the course of which he said that the mutessarif had informed the general in writing that he had referred the matter to the Ottoman Government, and should not obey, without its sanction, the instructions which had been given him.                                  PALESTINE    Arabs and Jews. General Clayton reported on the 3rd January [No. 267] that inthe Tul Keman [? Tell Keman] area some  discontent had been caused among the local inhabitants on account of some Jaffa Jews having outbidden them in the yearly lease of government lands by auction.  In  one case a plot which  had  been held for several years at a rental of 121. was acquired by the Jews at a rental of 150Z.                                    ARABIA.    King Hussein  and the Ihhwan. On  the 4th  January Sir Reginald  Wingate-reported [No. 14] that King Hussein had written to  Colonel Wilson intimating that-if the Ikhwan continued  to  occupy Khurma he should  abdicate, and begging that ibn saud  should  be pressed  to recall  Sultan Ibn  Bijad and his forces.  Colonel Wdsonthought  that if Ibn Saud were enjoined to withdraw Ibn  Bijad, Emir Khaled, andthose with them from Khurma, the fanatical Moslem movement, which, he was  firmlyconvinced, the Ikhwan were engineering, might be checked ; such  an  injunction  might,he  said, be based  on the  fact that the presence  of  his followers in   Khurma hadconstituted a danger to the security of Hejaz by the exciting of sectarian  feeling.  ibn saud might be informed that an openly hostile  concentration within striking distance ofMecca and Taif could not be tolerated in view of our obligations to King Hussein and our responsibility for the security of Hejaz; and that, if  necessary, pending the establishmentof a permanent boundary, we  would put  pressure on  the  King  to  prevent his forcesgoing east of Khurma.  Sir Reginald added that there could be no doubt as to FakhriPasha having been in communication with Ibn Saud.                                     INDIA.    The Moslem I^eague and the Occupation of Jerusalem. Reuters agent telegraphing- from Delhi on the 31st December reported that at a sitting of the Moslem League held that day  a resolution was passed protesting against  the  occupation  of  Jerusalem byBritish forces, praying for the immediate restoration of such holy places, and requestingthe British Governments  good offices to  dissuade the allies from  taking any step-&apos;affecting the  position and safety of the holy places.
