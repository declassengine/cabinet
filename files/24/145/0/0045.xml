The Bolsheviks.-On the 23rd January Mr. Alston transmitted [No. 96] a message[No. 71] from the high commissioner in regard to the present condition of the Bolshevikparty.  Sir Charles Eliot said that from information received it appeared that now theBolsheviks formed a relatively small privileged class (consisting chiefly of workmen andsoldiers), which, since it had a monopoly of food supplies and arms, was in a position toterrorize the rest of the population.  The party included a large foreign element, Letts,Esthonians, Jews, &amp;c, and  in the higher  posts  the  last-named, Jews, were especiallynumerous.   They  were  allowed complete licence in regard  to  the  other sections of society.  Their army was well disciplined.   The peasants were  only  permitted to sellfood to Bolsheviks, and the penalty for breach of this regulation  was death.   They hadburied a bishop alive and had killed many priests ;  in  consequence the  churches were closed.  Among other  barbarous punishments, people were frozen to death  by  beingdipped into rivers.     Sir Charles Eliot said that he was not in a position to guarantee this information,which, however, had been received from the British and French consuls at Ekaterinburg.     Employment  of Chinese and Corean Soldiers. Colonel  Wade telegraphed  fromWarsaw on the 19th January [No. 7] that it  had been  reported by persons  arrivingfrom Soviet Russia that the number  of Chinese and Corean units used by the Bolshevikswas increasing.   They did not form a regular  army but were merely bandits.UKRAINA.     M. Petlura and the Bolshevihs.-On the 27th January the Foreign Office telegraphed[No.  24]  to Mr.  Bagge,  the  consul-general  at Odessa, saying that statements had appeared in the press to the effect that M. Petlura had  declared war on the Bolsheviks,and asked him whether he could give any information on the subject.       [756]-102          ...                                     jg
 ........  On....the.2.9th.Mr. Bagge replied..[No.  35]  that  though war had  been declared onthe Bolsheviks by the  Diroriat the latter was powerless, its  own troops being them-selves Bolshevik to a great extent.   M. Fetlura had a small following, and he believedhim to be fairly honest.SIBERIA.     General Koltchak&apos;s Government. On the 22nd January  Sir Charles Eliot sent a message [No. 82&quot;! via Vladivostock [No. 100] in which he reported that he had deliveredthe  message which  he  had  been  instructed [E.R.  CII,  p.  2] to  give  to  GeneralKoltchak.   On that  occasion the latter had  spoken with confidence of the position inwhich his Government found itself, saying that it  had been greatly strengthened by theappointment of M. Sazonoff, the understanding with  General  Denikin, and the railwayagreement.   He had  pointed out,   however, that, lacking further  assistance, thesituation was bad from the military and financial points  of.view; and Sir Charles Eliotfeared that this was true.     The Suggested Conference at Principo. On  the  27th January Mr. Alston trans-mitted [No. 110] a message from  Sir Charles Eliot  [No. 90] reporting  that the OmskGovernment had  been  informed  by M.  SazunofF of the  proposed  armistice  andconference,  and   was,  in consequence,  in  a  state  of   consternation.   All themilitary  authorities agreed that the  spirit of the  troops would be destroyed by an armistice.     On  the 28th  January Mr.  Alston transmitted  i No.   113]  a telegram, dated27th January, from Sir  Charles Eliot  [No. 95] reporting that the  Omsk government intended to issue a communique giving the  substance of M.  Sazonoffs telegram andintimating that, whatever reply might be given when more details  had  been  received,the struggle with the Bolsheviks would continue!   He had been requested to  say  thatthis was absolutely necessary to prevent the fall of the  Koltchak Government and was by no means intended as a defiance to the Powers-.THE CAUCASUS.     Armenians and, Tartars.  In regard  to the  difficulties  which had arisen betweenthe  Armenians and the  Moslems  of Nakchivan  [E.R., No. C, p.  2]  Sir Percj7 Coxtelegraphed on the 23rd January that he had been informed by the consular  officer  atTabriz that the delegates  who  had been  sent to make peace had returned, and had reported the successful issue of their mission.     Situation  in  the  Georgian  Republic. The   &quot;Economic  Supplement&quot;  (15thJanuary)  of the War  Office  &quot;. Review of the Foreign Press&quot;  quotes the. following statement of the present  situation  from  the  &quot; Weltwirtschaftszeitung&quot; of the  13thDecember:      In  connection  with  the  recently founded  chamber of  commerce at Tiflis, the ministries have ordered that the supplies of copper in the republic  of Georgia shouldbe ascertained  as likely to form one of the  most suitable of exchange commodities.In other directions conditions in Georgia  are  developing favourably.   The new  state is making energetic attempts  to  form an  army of  its own  in order to  safeguard therepublic.  The Russian language, hitherto  officially  recognised, is being  replaced  bythe  Georgian,  and  Russian  officials   who  entered  office  after  the outbreak  ofthe  war  are  being  dismissed.  Those  who  enter  the  country  are  allowed  tobecome naturalised,  but  are  required   to  learn  the  Georgian  language.   Russianstate institutions  are  being liquidated  and   the  new  style  is  being introduced into the  calendar.  A press bureau  of  the Georgian democratic republic  has  beenestablished.                                     POLAND.     M. Paderewski. Lord Derby  reported [No. 178]  on the 26th  January that the &quot; Temps &quot; of that evening had published  a telegram addressed by M. Paderewski to the Polish National Committee at Paris and to the Polish representatives at Berne, Belgrade, Kiev, Stockholm, The Hague, and Vienna to  the effect that, having been entrusted  by General Pilsudski, head of the state, with the functions of president of the council and minister of foreign affairs, he desired  them to continue to take charge of Polish interests pending the definite organization of Polish missions abroad.
     The Zionist Leaders [E.R., No. CIV, p. 3]. Sir Horace Rurabold telegraphed onthe 27th January [No. 204] that the reported release of the Zionist  leaders had been confirmed by M. Zaleski, who  said that it had been rendered possible  by the change inthe military situation at Lemberg.     The Pogrom Accusation.   On  the 23rd January Colonel Wade reported [No. 21]that, though pressure of work had prevented him from making a complete investigation of the charges in regard to pogroms, he had collected a good deal of information.     Under the feeble police administration of tbe  last Government there had  been agood many arbitrary acts, such as unauthorized  requisitioning,  involving violence to individuals,  but there had been great exaggeration on the part of the Jews  in regardto them.     Such acts were  due to  the intense unpopularity  of the Jews  caused by  theirprofiteering subserviency to (?the conquerors) during the  German occupation, to  theirhaving escaped combatant service, to  the leading part taken  by them  in  the Bolshevikagitation, and to the far-reaching claims for national autonomy made by the Zionists.And this popular feeling  was inflamed by anti-Semitic pressure.     The violence complained of was not always the work of the Poles :  at Lemberg, forexample, unorganised brigands plundered  the  Jewish quarters, the plundering partyincluding demobilised Austrian  soldiers and convicts, who had been  released by theUkrainans.     The same question is dealt with in the &quot; Allied Press Supplement&quot; (22nd January)of the War  Office &quot; Review of the Foreign Press,&quot; as follows :       The campaign against the slanders  cast upon the  Poles, accusing them of havingorganized pogroms of the Jews, still continues.  The &quot; Kurjer Poznanski &quot; (4th January)writes :-     Since the Lwow incidents the Jewish-German  press, with the  &quot; Berliner Tageblatt&quot;in the lead,  gives to any political event which occurs in Poland a tinge of anti-Semitism;it fabricates inventions concerning pogroms of the Jews, and endeavours to represent thePoles as a lawless nation having no right to govern itself.     Referring to the -inventiveness of the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; as far  as pogroms ingeneral, and especially the recent,  report of  a pogrom  in Poznan, are concerned, the&quot; Kurjer Poznanski &quot; quotes from  the &quot;Vossische Zeitung &quot;  the following  statement,headed  &quot; No Pogroms in  Poland &quot; :      The German people&apos;s council in Poznan asserts  that the rumours concerning thepogroms of the Jews in Poznan are without foundation.  From the Jewish side it is also stated that  no pogroms have ever taken place in Poznan.     It  is a well-known fact that no one in Poland  ever dreamed of organizing pogromsof the Jews, says  the &quot; Kurjer  Poznanski,&quot;  but  the  well-calculated and  systematiccampaign led throughout the world by tbe Jews may result in inculcating antipathy forthe  Piles in  certain allied circles  subject to the Jewish influence.   It is  not  to bewondered at that Polish  public opinion conceives an ever-increasing contempt for suchmethods.   This feeling of the Poles,  if the causes of  it persist, may finally  end bychanging into anti-Semitism.   The &quot; Kurjer Poznanski&quot; therefore appeals to the Jewishpopulation in Poland to assist  the Poles in their endeavour to-smooth out the differencesexisting between the two races.   In the  conclusion of the leader, the &quot; Kurjer &quot; quotesa denial of the rumours concerning pogroms which has been issued  by the Jewish people&apos;council  in Poznan.     The Poznan &quot; Oredownik &quot; publishes a. statement to  the same effect as  that issuedby  the  &quot; Kurjer Poznanski,&quot; and warns the Poles that the only means of counteractingthis defamatory campaign is to behave themselves in such  a manner as not to give  the berlin Polonophobes tbe  slightest pretext  for restarting  it.   Nothing must be done tofacilitate the work of our enemies.     The  Czech Invasion. Colonel Wade reported on the 26th January [No. 30] that,according to  information  received by him,  a  great revulsion of feeling against the paris committee had been produced by the Czech invasion,  as everyone had been  inducedby  that committee to believe that the coalition Government would be supported by theallies.   At  the same time complaint was  made  that  the . pledges  of  the allies had remained unfulfilled, and that now an act of spoliation was countenanced by  them.     Colonel Wade added that the general staff had reported the complete blockade ofPoland, the Czechs having stopped railway communication between Vienna and Cracow.

                                   RUMANIA.     Naturalization of  Jews. On the  13th  January Sir George . Barclay  reported[No. 27] that a decree had been  published for the naturalization of all  Jews living inthe country who were not already subjects of other countries.                                    TURKEY     Punishment  of those responsible for  the  Armenian  Atrocities. On  the  22ndJanuary Admiral Calthorpe reported [No.  158] that  a  few days previously he  had spoken  with the grand vizier and the minister for  foreign affairs about  the  persons responsible for the Armenian massacres and for the  ill-treatment  of prisoners  of war,and in consequence they had expressed their readiness to inflict suitable punishment.     On the 21st  January Damacl Faid Pasha saw Mr. Holder on behalf of the Sultan,his brother-in-law, and informed him that the latter  intended to punish those who were responsible for these crimes, and with that  object  in  view, as  he did not  think  thepresent cabinet sufficiently energetic, he  was  considering the formation  of  anothercomposed of more vigorous men.  Damad Faid Pasha further said  that  those guilty ofthese crimes would probably become desperate if they found themselves the object of serious  action,  and they belonged  to the largest  and strongest organization in thecountry.  The Sultan, in fact, feared an attack on himself and those who thought withhim, and he wanted to  know what, in the  event of such  an outbreak, would be our attitude.   The  Sultan  and his  sympathizers wished,  he said,  friendship with  anddependence on Great Britain.   In  his reply Mr. Hohler carefully avoided committing himself to anything which could be interpreted as a promise to help the Sultan ; but heintimated that the British Government would insist  on  the punishment of the guiltyand would certainly prevent public disorder, adding that he presumed  its action would support constituted authority.     Two days later he reported [No.  170] that a list had been prepared of persons  still at large in Constantinople who had been concerned in the  Armenian massacres.   Therewere some  sixty of them,  and  the  minister of  the  interior wanted to  arrest  allat one coup.  The business appeared to be hindered by the  timidity of  the Sultan, butit was,  Admiral Calthorpe said, rapidly coming to a  head.   Some  persons  had alreadybeen arrested;  the gramd vizier said between 160 and  200, but this, he  thought, was an  exaggeration.     The G.U.P. and  the Sultan. Admiral Calthorpe  reported on the 24th January[No. 175]  that according  &apos;to information  which  had . reached  him  from  what  was apparently  a  particularly  reliable source, Said Halim was scheming  to put PrinceAbdul Rahim or Prince fuad in the place of the Sultan.  Said was too weak to do this of  himself, and he, Admiral Calthorpe,  had been unable, so far,  to ascertain who wasbehind  him ;  there appeared, however,  to be  no  doubt  that the  C.U.P.  must be credited with the scheme.     Control of the Banks.-On the 25th January Admiral Calthorpe reported [No. 184]that control of the German  and A ustrian-Hungarian  banks  in Constantinople had, asa.measure of military precaution, been assumed by the  general officer in command : by so  doing he had anticipated  the  action  of the high commissioner, who had demandedthe issue of a provisional law stopping the  activities of the  banks.  The general had,through Admiral  Calthorpe, asked the  Italian and French authorities to help him by providing controllers with  banking experience.                                     SYRIA.     The Future of Syria, The &quot; Neutral Supplement &quot; of the War Office &quot;Review ofthe Foreign Press&quot; says  that  M. Chekri  Ganem  forwarded to M. Clemenceau on the 11th January telegrams from  the Syrian  committees  of the various  states of SouthAmerica,  representing  600,000  adherents, to the central Syrian committee, requestingit to demand from the peace conference that the integral reconstitution of Syria, underthe regime of federative autonomies, should be entrusted to France.     It goes on  to  say that, referring  to  the recent  congress on Syrian questions atMarseilles, the &quot;  Debats &quot; of the 9th January remarks that the unanimous  sentiment ofthe congress was that what Syria needed was not colonization but direction.     It is  not a  case of annexation, or of a protectorate dnthe Tunisian  sense  of the
 word.  It is a matter of control and guidance, which shall last until the nation is ripe to undertake the direction of its own destinies.  It must assure at once the emancipation of Syria and the confirmation of the mark of French culture, which would he effaced if we allowed another nation to undertake the task for which we are pointed out.  The form that the reconstitution should take cannot yet be defined.  It will probably tend in the direction of federation; but one must begin  by organizing the different elements which will be called on to compose it.   It would be dangerous-to try to build up a vast constitutional-edifice at one stroke.            **.       .               .    .            &apos;   &apos;         &apos;  &apos;     Pro-British Syrians in Egypt. Sir Hinde Cheetham reported on-the 26th January [No. 130] that the Syrians  in  Egypt who  were in  favour of  Great Britain  had  been greatly excited by  a report that Prince Feisal had accepted in full the French claim in regard to Syria.  In the  event of this rumour being correct  they declared  that they should agitate  for  the whole  of Syria  (including; it was to  be  presumed, Palestine) being placed under the protection of the United States.                                    ARABIA.     Ibn Sand and Fakhri Pasha. Sir Milne Cheetham telegraphed on the 24th January [No. 133] that it had been reported from Yenbo that Fakhri  Pasha had stated that, so far from his having received assistance  from Ibn  Saud, the latter had throughout been a positive hindrance.     The suggested Hejaz Medal [E.R., No. CI,  p.  6b- The Foreign Office informed Sir Reginald Wingate on the 25th January [No. 120] that as.the proposed declaration was of the nature of a commemorative war medal,  its bestowal would  mean that the troops concerned would receive a medal not granted to those serving in other  theatres;- for this reason the War Office could not concur in the proposed grant.  This, however, did not mean  that  a suggestion to c nfer a decoration  on individuals actually attached to the Arab forces would  be rejected if made by King Hussein or Prince Feisal.                                  TURKESTAN.     The Armenians. The  political officer at  Baghdad,  in a, telegram despatched on the 27th January, recalled that there were now encamped near Baghdad  some 48,000 Christians, of whom 10,000  were Armenians from Lake Van.   In regard to  the general attitude  of the tribes  to these and- the other Armenian refugees, Major Noel had reported that they were determined that their country being now practically free ol Armenians should remain so.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     Baghdad  Opinion in regard  to the  future Government. The political officer at Baghdad having been requested to ascertain  the views  of  the native population  in regard to  the  future  government of  Mesopotamia,  obtained  the nomination of SO delegates, 50  Moslem, 20  Jewish, and 10 Christian the Moslems being divided into two groups, 25 Sun id and 25 Shiah.     The Jews  and Christians, nearly half the community,  who comprise  the  vast majority of the important traders  and are far  ahead of the bulk of  the IVloslems  in education and political knowledge, look  forward with the greatest alarm and indignation to any form of government other than British rule without a native head.     The Moslem  delegates, some of whom were formerly strong adherents of the C.U.P., asked for a single Arab state extending from  Mosul to the Gulf, under a son of King Hussein, no mention being made of foreign protection.  The delegates were bound down beforehand to  ask  for an Arab  government  without  European protection, and those who showed any unwillingness to  agree were threatened with religious and social ostracism.   Seven of the delegates, representing a  very large proportion of the property owned by the  whole fifty, refused at the last moment to attend the meeting; all of them desired a continuance of effective British control, most of  them British rule pure  and simple.   Other Moslem notables from the beginning  declined to take  any part in the proceedings: no member of the Naqib&apos;s family, for. example, was  present.   The Naqib himself expressed  regret and   surprise at our having consulted native, opinion; headvocated a British administration, co-operating with  the, natives and employing them in a gradually increasing measure.
    There has been a revulsion of feeling in Baghdad since the result  of the Moslemmeetings  has become known, and a document asking for British  protection without an.Arab  ruler is being circulated among the leading notables.       [Information as to the native opinion in other places will be given hi the                                  next Report.]                *    The Armenians at Diar Uz Zor. The political  officer  at Baghdad reported on the24th0 January that  100  Armenians  were  being relieved by the  political  officer atDiar  Uz Zor,  and  that  200  others  in  that  place  were barely  able  tjp  exist :  ofthose  already being relieved  30 were  destitute widows and  70 were  orphans.  Thepolitical officer  at Baghdad added that he was making arrangements for the relief ofthe others.                                     PERSIA.    The N.W.  District. Sir Percy Cox, telegraphing on the  22nd  January  [No.  58],reported  that  the general situation  was unsatisfactory.    He  had  heard,  he  said,that an expedition was being sent against some of the khans of Karajadagh who were inrebellion.   The Kboi  and  Salinas districts were  unsettled owing to Simko, who hadcollected a considerable number of Kurds  and  was looting the villages :  it would beimpossible to advise Christians to return to those districts as long as  he  remainedunpunished.   In Ardebil there seemed to be a considerable  amount of Bolshevism.The Maraga and Sujbulak districts, however,  were quiet;  and until the spring no-trouble need be  anticipated from the  Shasevens, who had  withdrawn to their winterquarters.    The  communication between Tabriz and  Tiflis  was practically interrupted, and itwas only with difficulty that the  deputation sent to negotiate between the Tartars andthe Armenians  managed to get through.o
