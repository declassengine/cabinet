Suggested Union of Russian Soviet Republics.wireless message was sent out from Moscow :       In a  leading article of  the  &quot; Izvestiya&quot; of the  All-Russian  central  executivecommittee,  Mr. Kerjentseff draws  attention to the fact that  the Ukrainan comradesare awakening to a consciousness of the  necessity for putting an end  to  partisanwarfare and to independent actions in administration and  state construction.   Havingonce done away with partisanship  in  warfare,  it will be necessary to abolish it  equallyin other matters.   Division of strength  must  be avoided, regular registration adopted,and  all  forces  must  be united for  the   construction  of a new  united  army.Mr.  Goikhbarg [?], in the same journal,  mentions the statement  of  the Ukrainancentral executive  committee concerning  Mr. Trotsky&apos;s report  on the necessity for theunion of soviet republics in an armed  struggle against the  common enemy.  The unionof post, telegraph, and railways is  working well, as  is the union of the organizations ofnational  economy and of the financial  system, but it is  necessary to legalize  thesetemporary  arrangements.   Internal construction and external warfare will be carriedon more successfully after the union of  all  soviet republics in one  socialist federativesoviet republic with one soviet government.OMSK  GOVERNMENT.     Japan to give Provisional  Recognition. On the 24th May Lord Curzon informed[No. 277J  Mr. Alston (Tokyo) that he  had received a note from the Japanese charged&apos;affaires informing him  that, subject to certain  conditions,  his  government intendedto afford provisional  recognition to that of Admiral  Kolchak.   The conditions would include (1) a definite  assurance  of  the  indebtedness  undertaken by Russia before mr. Kerensky&apos;s government was overthrown,  and  (2) whatever might be considered essential for the safeguarding of the other legitimate interests of foreign nations.   the note suggested that the question of recognition might be discussed at Paris.   Lord Curzon
said that he had  informed the charge&quot; d&apos;affaires  that the Foreign Office had also cometo the conclusion that the Omsk government should be recognized, and that the matter was being discussed in Paris; he had also told him that he thought that other definiteguarantees would be required, one, for example, for the continuance  of a  friendlyattitude towards the border states and  their continued existence, and another for  the summoning at an early date of a constituent assembly for the purpose of  determining the future government of Russia.                                    POLAND.    Mr. Paderewski on his Labours at  the Peace Conference. According to a  wireless message, despatched from Warsaw on the  24th  May, at a meeting  of the  diet on  theprevious day Mr. Paderewski, president of the council, gave an account of his laboursat  the peace conference.   Pie  stated  that  the conference  assigned  to  Poland  about54,000 square kilometres of Polish territories.  Touching on the question of the liquidation of the old Austro-Hungarian monarchy, he stated that  the peace conference desired thatthe Czecho-Polish  conflict should  be settled by arbitration and by the  two parties concerned, and quoted the formally expressed wish of Mr. Lansing on  this subject.  Pieasked the diet to give him a mandate to negotiate with President  Masaryk, and readMr. Masaryk&apos;s favourable reply on the subject of negotiations at Prague.     Mr. Paderewski next expressed his homage and gratitude to General Pilsudski forthe liberation of Lida,  Svenziany, Vilna,  and  the towns  of  eastern  Galicia.   (Theseremarks were received with loud applause, all the  deputies rising to  their feet.)   Thepresident continuing said that Poland did not aim at imperialist conquests, and did notdispute the independence of Lithuania  and Ukraina, but was ready to lend them aid.The Polish troops who  were freeing  those territories from Bolshevist oppression were followed by trains loaded with food.  He declared  that he desired a  plebiscite for  thestarving population of the north-eastern borders.     Mr. Paderewski laid stress on  the  political support lent to  Poland  by PresidentWilson and America, and on  the economic assistance&apos; rendered  in  the shape  of food,clothing, and raw  materials.   Pie  quoted Mr.  Hoover!s letter  on the subject of thedespatch of food and cotton to Poland  as well as of a loan to be contracted in America.     The  peace  conference  having expressed a  desire  for   peace on   all fronts,Mr. Paderewski had promised to do  all in his  power  to  conclude an armistice as wellas to conform with the demand that General Plallers troops should not fight against theUkrainans.   It  was  probable, he  stated, that General flaller s  troops would fight onthe Ukrainan front, but only against the Bolsheviks.   The negotiations for  an armisticehad been broken off on  account of the atrocities  committed  by the so-called Ukrainanarmy.  The offensive in  Galicia, he declared, was not a war,  bat an expedition againstbandits. The Ukrainan nation, the speaker declared, was not responsible for  the  creationof such an army, and Poland was not making war on it.  Mr. Paderewski concluded byasking the  diet  to authorize the Polish  government to negotiate with  the  fugitiveUkrainan government.     Recognition by Spain. On the 23rd May  Sir Arthur Plardinge  telegraphed fromMadrid [No. 498] that a  charge  d&apos;affaires was being sent to Warsaw, as  the  Spanishgovernment had decided to recognize, the independence of Poland.                                    TURKEY.ASIA MINOR.     Provision -for  dealing  with Disorder in the Aidin  vilayet. On  the 19th MayMr. Balfour reported [No. 914] from Paris that the following telegram had been sentto the Admiralty for communication to Admiral Calthorpe :      The council of the principal allied  and associated powers has approved that  in theevent of disorders in the vilayet of Aidin anywhere  north  of  Aidin inclusive  Greektroops may be sent to  restore  order, but only  after obtaining the approval  of theS.N.O. of the allied fleets at Smyrna, who will be the final  judge as to  whether thecircumstances justify the despatch of troops.   Greek troops  may,  however, be sentwithout special authority to the districts within the sandjak  of Smyrna,  but not southof Ayasoluk and within the kaza of  Aivali for  the purpose  of establishing order  andprotecting the  returning refugees.  The  Greek military authorities should  be givenfacilities on all railway Hues radiating from Smyrna for carrying out these movements.
M.  Venezelos  has sent  instructions  to  the Greek authorities  to  conform to  thisarrangement.     Smyrna. On the  24th Lord Granville reported [No.  281]  that the minister forforeign  affairs  bad given him the following account of the troubles at Smyrna on theauthority of the vice-president of the council  who had  returned to Athens on theprevious day:      On  the day  of occupation one body of Greek  troops by some mistake took the wrong route and  entered the Turkish quarter where  they were fired on by turkish troops.   [? A detachment of] Greek troops was  accompanied by a dense crowd, [? therewere] some seventy killed  and wounded.  The Greeks at once counter-attacked andcleared  quarter very quickly.   During this operation some bad  elements, including jail-birds, released  by the  Turks the  day  before, pointed out houses to Greek troops fromwhich they said they had been fired on.  The Greek troops broke into these houses, andthe crowd thus got in and pillaged.  Amongst the pillagers there were certainly men inGreek uniform, but  the minister for  foreign  affairs declared these were  natives  of smyrna  who had been demobilized and put on  their  uniform on entry of [? Greek][? troops].     He  admitted that some  troops had  got out of hand, and had committed excessesfrom fury at  having been  attacked, and  the colonel  in  command was being severelydealt with  for  taking the wrong  route, and also for failing to  keep control of his men.Some&apos;300  [? Turks]  had been killed.  Proclamation had been  made  that  all stolenproperty  must  be restored and the victims indemnified, and much property had alreadybeen recovered.  Several pillagers including two Greek  soldiers had  been  tried and shot.     He   declared that the  Turkish population, except the Young  Turks,  were  nowfraternizing with the Greeks.     On the 20th May  the British commander-in-chief in the  Mediterranean reported from Smyrna that the town was then quiet, and that there was a marked improvementin the situation.  Thirty-one  had been  sentenced by court-martial to  penal servi-tude, two others, one a civilian and one a soldier, had been  shot.  All  forts  had been evacuated by the allies and handed over to  the Greeks.  It was indicated  by manyreports from the interior that reprisals w7ere being organized by the CUP.     On the 24th May Admiral Calthorpe telegraphed [No. 1121] that a ieport, datedthe  23rd  May,  had been received from  Mr. Morgan at  Smyrna, informing him that aplot had  been  discovered amongst the members of the Turkish garrison in  Smyrna,which in  consequence was to be sent to Constantinople on the 24th.     The  Italians  at  Ayasoluk. On   the  24th   May  Admiral Calthorpe reported[No. 1121] that he had been informed by  Mr. Morgan of the withdrawal of the Italiansfrom Ayasoluk two days previously.     The  Moslem  refugees from  Nif. On the  24th  May  Admiral  Calthorpe also reported  [No.  1121]  that Mr. Morgan had further  informed him   that the Moslemrefugees from Nif who were at Kassaba had telegraphed  from  the latter place sayingthat the Greek troops at Nif would  be, driven out by the Moslems if they did notwithdraw of their own accord.                                     ARABIA.     King Hussein and Ibn  Saud. On the 16th May  the political agent at  Baghdad[No. 5549, received 23rd May] reported the receipt at Bahrein of a  letter sent on the5th  May  by Ibn Saud, in which it was  stated that some of King  Hussein&apos;s troops had attacked  a body  of Nejd tribesmen,  and  had  lost  14 men   in  the fray;  they had captured, however, 200 camels.  There was also a report that  Ibn Saud had proceeded to the rescue of an Ikhwan  party, which had  been surrounded  in  Ashaira by KingHnssehfs men.  This  report had been received through the  shaykh of Koweit.     Telegraphing on the 27th May  [No. 857] General  Allenby reported  that  EmirAbdulla&apos;s advance supply dep6t was said to be still in Ashaira.     He reported,  too, that King Hussein  had written saying that his conscience wouldnot  allow him to be  the cause of bloodshed among  Arabs,   and that he  would  be compelled to abdicate as the quickest means ot removing the present difficulties ; pendingthe  receipt of a reply he had written to Abdulla instructing him  to  remain as far aspossible on the defensive.&apos;
     General Allenby said that Ibn Saud&apos;s letter, which the king  had sent him, wasnot  inimical ;  it threw  the responsibility of peace or war on the king whom he askedto trust him, saying that he might be assured that he,  Ibn  Saud, did  not wish to  behostile unless he were driven- to be so by extreme circumstances.  If a decisive battlebetween Abdulla and ibn Saud was to be prevented  instant action  was necessary; ifthe battle should take place and Ibn Saud be victorious he would probably enter Mecca.He  thought the moment  bad come  for  us  to  definitely  support  the king  againstIbn  Saud : the only alternative being to let them fight it out.     On the 28th May General Allenby further reported [No.  869] that the followingmessage had  been sent on the previous day by Emir Ali  to King  Hussein : &quot; I havebeen informed from a sure  source to-day that Ibn  Saud has ordered   the Wahhabis  toassist Khurma and is urging them on ; also that he has arrived at Queiah and sent fivehorses for Akhwan.  The Wahhabis have left for Khurma.&quot;     In regard to this, King Hussein telegraphed as follows  : &quot; I finally beg you to tellme in what manner the declaration of my abdication  should be  made, if only  for the sake of respecting the  opinion of his majesty&apos;s  government  on  this  point, as on  all others.   I  do not ask or want  to trouble  his majesty&apos;s government to communicate with Ibn Saud, because  my statements on the subject have  been repeatedly  explained.I anxiously await a reply.&quot;     General Allenby added that the king was evidently much   perturbed  by thesituation, which vindicated the opinion that  he  had always  expressed regarding ibn saud&apos;s real intentions  and the  seriousness of the  Wahhabis movement  under  hisguidance.  Ibn  Saud was now- said  to  be at Queiah, which is said to be  four daysnorth-east  of Sakhkhan, which is four days north-east of Khurma.     Emir  Abdulla  suffers a reverse. On the  28th May General Allenby reported[No. 877] that King Hussein had been informed  that the  Akhwan  had  driven  EmirAbdulla from Tarabab.  Abdulla was  said to be at Kelaikh,  to the east of Taif.   Therewas  no definite news of the regular force  he had with  him at Tarabah, but it was  saidthat he had got away with some 500 mounted irregulars only.     Letter from Ibn Saud to Emir Abdulla. On  the  28th  May General Allenbytelegraphed [No. 868] the following summary of Ibn Saud&apos;s letter to  Emir Abdulla :      In polite terms he acknowledges the receipt of a  letter, dated the 10th May, fromAbdulla.   Referring to  the need for doing all necessary  for the  attainment of the prosperity  of  Islam  and the  Arabs,  he  says that he  is acting accordingly, and hashumiliated  himself in many ways in order to arrive at an agreement with King Hussein,but all to no purpose.  He complains that Abdulla regards him as a heretic, and quotesa prophecy that Moslems &quot;will be divided  amongst themselves in 73  denominations.&quot;He challenges Abdulla to fight the remaining  71  denominations  first, and to turn  his attention to Wahhabism after converting these and obtaining their  submission.   Heaccuses  Abdulla of  turning guns, and  Moslem guns, against  Moslems.  He  assertsthat his brothers and subjects are ready to die for their  religion,  and  will do  so to thelast man.   He deprecates war between Moslems, and says :  &quot; Rely upon God and go  to your country, and when  you get there  all your  demands can be answered to the satisfaction both of yourself and of your  father who is backing you.  I  swear thatwhen the  people  of  Nejd  heard  of  your present movement they  all started  with enthusiasm to oppose you  ....  intervene, if you will  be guided, and stop hostilities.I will  restrain them all,  but if you prefer  the other solution (war)  I  will act  inaccordance with the words  of Unawari, who said &apos; I-am  a man of my nation should Ihave nothing more to say.&apos; &quot;     Italian advances to Idrisi. On the 22nd  May General  Allenby  reported [No. 829]that no advances to Idrisi on the part of the Italians  had been reported since the visit of an Arab merchant, Mohammed Salim, six months ago.  Salim, who was known to  bean Italian agent, went to Jeizan really to  present  Idrisi with a motor-car, sent  by thegovernor of Massawa, though ostensibly to buy  cattle.  Idrisi accepted  the  presentand then made a  public declaration contrasting the  neglect of himself by the Italians,when his usefulness to them in the former war had been terminated  by the making ofpeace, with the good treatment he had received from the British ; and this declaration was made in Saiinfs presence.   In private Idrisi also made it clear that he understood.and was not impressed by the motive which had prompted the present.
                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     General Situation. On the 13th May the political officer at Baghdad reported that public order was well maintained, that there appeared to he  reasonable content amongthe tribesmen and townsfolk, and that in  short the general situation was satisfactory.There was, however, some unrest in the  Nasiriyah district in which trouble was still being caused by the recalcitrant chief Badar Rumaiyith.     The main desire, he added, of the educated classes in Baghdad, was to have as soonas possible further instalments of civil as opposed to military government.                               THE ARMENIANS.     The Nahhchivan district [See E.R. CXX, p. 5]. On the  8th May Sir Percy Coxtelegraphing from Teheran [No.337]  reported that the  prime minister of  Persia had informed him that deputations  of Persians had come to Tabriz from Nakhchivan for thepurpose of protesting against their abandonment to the Armenians and of pressing their claims to be restored  to the  jurisdiction of the Persian government.   It was alleged that the taking over of Nakhchivan was already being attempted  by the Armenians ofErivan.  The  prime minister said that strong public resentment  was being arousedby this.     On the 12th May Sir Percy Cox telegraphed [No. 348]  reporting that a  message had&quot;that day been sent to the general officer commanding at Tiflis  telling him  that thePersian government had informed him, Sir Percy Cox, that the  Persian  inhabitants ofNakhchivan had  been told that Armenian troops would occupy that town, and that ifany hostility were shewn to them it would be regarded as hostility to the British ; further,that they had been so informed by order of the general officer commanding.   Sir percy cox added that much resentment was being caused in Teheran by this  news, and thatour policy in Persia was likely to be prejudiced.     On the 21st May Sir Percy Cox  transmitted [No.  372] a telegram sent on theprevious day by the consul at Tabriz saying that the British  military authorities had handed over the Nakhchivan districts to  the Armenian republic, and that the Britishtroops would be leaving Nakhchivan shortly.  The British military representative would remain there to safeguard Moslem  interests.     The Van  district. On the 20th May Sir  Percy Cox transmitted [No.  371] an extract from a  message sent on the  previous day by  the consul at Tabriz.   The lattersaid that, according to  an agent  who had, at his request, been  sent  by the deputy-governor to Van  from Khoi, it Avas reported in the former place that the British andPersian governments had agreed that the  Armenians should return, through  Persia, tothat district.   This had very much frightened the Kurds, who had appealed for advice,to the vali and Javid Bey.  There had been a meeting of Kurd chiefs, and those presenthad sworn opposition to the Armenians.                                 AFGHANISTAN.     The reported application for  cessation of  hostilities. The India Office issued thefollowing statement on  the 26th May :      With reference to the statement that has appeared in  the press to the effect thatthe Afghan commander-in-chief applied  for a cessation of hostilities, the facts are asfollows :      In telegraphing on the 15th May to  the secretary of state on the military position the government of India incidentally mentioned the receipt  of such an application, butAvithout appearing to attach  much importance  to it.  Tbe  secretary of state at  oncetelegraphed for  further particulars,  and  asked  whether the request could not be madethe basis of negotiation.     In reply the government of India telegraphed on the 18th May the full text of thecommander-in-chief&apos;s message, Avhich was addressed to the political agent, Khyber, and ran as follows :           Sir, As regards the outbreak of war between Afghanistan and Britain I have     the honour to inform you that British  officers commenced an unlawful war without     any declaration of war on any side, and by this aggressive step inflicted heaA^y     losses on  the civil population and army of Afghanistan  by throA^ ing bombs from     aeroplanes.       [756]-676                                                         C
         I  am  informed  by bis  majesty the king  of  the independent  kingdom of     Afghanistan that his majesty has received a letter from his excellency the, viceroy,     and in consequence of that I am ordered to suspend war, thus  unlawfully begun     by your side, until further arders.         You are accordingly informed  that war  has  been suspended  until a  final     decision has been reached by correspondence between his Afghan majesty and his     excellency the viceroy.     The government of India added that this insolent message was  obviously devised to gain time, an explanation to which  the Afghans themselves gave currency among the  frontier tribes, and that they had instructed the political agent at Khyber to reply that he was not authorized to answer the message, and  that if  the Amir wished for peace  he should address  the viceroy through the  officer in command of the British forces.     To this invitation the Amir so far has made no  response, and  offensive preparations continue to be made by the Afghans along the whole frontier.     It need hardly be said that the allegations made in the message as to aggressive action by British officers were entirely without foundation.     The Amirs reply to the viceroy&apos;s letter protesting against the Afghan proceedings has  now been received.  It is defiant in tone, and  leaves no doubt  as to Amanulla&apos;s personal complicity.     Military Operations. The India Office has put  out the following communiques :      1.  On  the 14th May Afghan emissaries were reported  still to be busy, trying to incite the tribesmen to rise.  A party of  some 300 Afghans who had occupied positions south of Mirkandi, on the Chitral river [6 miles east of the frontier and 100&apos; miles north of Peshawar] were driven back with some loss by  our Chitral scouts and the bodyguard of the Mehta of Chitral.   There were no  casualties on our side.     MAY 21.  An Afghan force of two or three battalions with about six guns, with a tribal  lashkar  under Mir Sahib Jan Badshah,  is reported  to  be at Chalanai in  the Mohmand  country,  13 miles north-west of Shabkadar  [which is 15 miles  north  of Peshawar].   Our outpost at Shabkadar has been reinforced.     Afghan forces  with guns are also reported to have reached Urgun [about 60 miles south-east of Ghazni and just within the  Afghan frontier] and a point about  100  miles south of Ghazni.  (This dissemination of Afghan forces along our frontier tends to show that the object of the Afghans is to raise the tribes against us along the whole frontier.)     On the 20th May buildings in Jelalabad from  which, shots were  fired at our aeroplanes were successfully bombed, the  Afghan headquarters barracks being hit, as well as a parade of some 2,000 troops and a column of troops on the march.     The guns  captured  on  the  17th  May are now  reported  to  number five, all Krupp guns.     MAY 22.   Air  reconnaissances  report  no  movements of  importance  west  of Jelalabad.   The tribes along  the  whole  frontier  are.  reported  to be  still quiet.   Nofurther active operations are reported beyond  the  effective bombing of troops at  Kahiand  Pesh-Bolak  [16 miles west of the frontier  opposite  Peshawar].     2. On the 22nd May air reconnaissance reported no movements of importance  east of Jelalabad.  Afghan troops on the Dakka front were reported to be having difficulty with their  ration  supply and local lashkars  to be  disinclined  to  concentrate for the same reason.     Attempts to get the local tribesmen to attack Dakka are  reported to  have failed owing to the difficulties of supply.  Amanulla, is said  to have visited  Jelalabad, but tohave returned to Kabul.     The tribal gathering in Gandao, in the Mahommedan  country [north of the Khyber], is said to be increasing.  General Nadir Khan is reported  as still  vacillating iu Khost [in Afghan territory south of the Kurram river].     Our propaganda is believed to be having a good effect in Ningrahar, and the moral of the Afghan troops is said to be deteriorating. - Tribesmen generally are still holding-aloof, though in some cases tribal lashkars are said to be with the Afghan forces.     MAY 25. The Zakka Khel maliks have  brought  in  without  ransom two airmen,Lieutenants Hoare and Barker, who were forced to descend in the  Bazar valley, that is,tribal territory (in the Khyber region ; the Zakka Khels are Afridis). -     From Jelalabad it  is reported that great confusion  was caused . there  by the air raid  on the  21st May.   Several government buildings  were set on fire and-the town isreported as  practically deserted.
     On the 23rd May the general position was unchanged, and all the frontier districtswere reported quiet.     Great activity as regards military preparations was reported in Kandahar  on  the21st May.     3. Up to the 24th May the general situation remained unchanged, and  the tribalattitude good.   From Chitral (north of Peshawar) it was reported that some Afghanswere holding a position five  miles above Arnawai (40 miles south of Chitral  on  theKunar river).   A small Afghan force is  still  in Gandao  (Mohmand country, south of-Chitral).     Our patrols on the Mohmand border were fired on, and our aeroplanes in this area were fired on by small Afghan guns.     A reliable report  stated that no Afghan troops had left  Kandahar  up to  the21st May.     On the 25th May the Mohmands  are  reported to be  behaving correctly, and  theAfridis to be in a submissive mood.  The latter are surrendering rifles taken away bydeserters from the Khyber Rifles.     The Afridis  are reported to  have looted a large  number  of rifles  and artilleryammunition from Jelalabad, when it was deserted after our air raid.     In the Kurram valley (south-west of the  Kbyber) a party of militia has been firedon by an Afghan picket.  The militia returned the fire, killing three of the picket.     4. Increased activity is reported on the  Khost border [south-west of Peshawar],From Miramshah, in the Tochi valley,  30 miles west of Banrm [south of Peshawar  and east of Khost], a report has been received that General Nadir Khan has sent a triballashkar to Zanshora, 15  miles north-west of Miramshah, ou the Afghan  side  of the border, and it is rumoured that General  Nadir Khan intends to advance down the Kaituvalley on Spinwam (18  miles north-west of Bannu), or towards Charkai (12 miles north of Miramshah).     In the Tochi valley the cutting of telegrajdi wires continues.     On the 24th May a tribal lashkar near Galanai (13 miles  north-west  of Shabkadarin the Mohmand country) [which is north of Peshawar], believed to be composed mainly of Afghan  tribesmen from Kunar (the valley of the river of the  name which  joins theKabul river near  Jelalabad) was  very  effectively bombed and scattered northwards.Another lashkar, estimated at 4,000, was seen  moving north-west from Nahakki (8 miles .N.W. of Galanai).     Jelalabad was again  effectively bombed, and large portions of the military part ofthe town are reported to be burnt out.     On  the 24th May our aeroplanes  bombed the powder factory and fort in Kabul.A large  explosion was observed.     Up to the 24th May the tribal situation on the  north-west frontier was reportedto be improving day  by day, and the  danger  of an  Afridi rising appeared to bedecreasing.     The Amir and the  Bolsheviks.
