                      FORTNIGHTLY  REPORTON..iuiJVOLUTIO:;Aiiy ORGANISATIONS  IN THE  UNITED KINGDOM,             AND  MORALE IN FOlUSIGK COUNT. JES.(Sit(Circulated by &quot;the Home Secretary).          Since tho tremendous events of a week ago,  the  Pacifists have been busy     tearing  off their disguise, and re-appearing in  thoir  proper garb as     revolutionaries.   The outburst of loyalty and patriotism  all over tho     country  has been surprising, but it should not be  allowed  to blind us to the     very  widespread fooling among tho working classes  that Thrones have become     anachronisms, and that tho Soviet may-still prove  to be tho best form&quot;6f     Government for a democracy.   This feeling does  not  seem to be confined to     tho declared revolutionaries.   ivy correspondent in  Loodr?  describes a dis-     cussion  ho overheard, in which two working men of  middle age v;ere advooating     the institution of an elected President for this oountry,   Thoy discussed     the question quite calmly, their chief argument  being that there would be     loss  intriguing with an elected President than there is about the Court of     tho Sovereign, and they cited, somewhat inconsoquently, the enemy Princes     who hold British titles.   This conversation is  quoted only as a fair     indication of what is being said by moderate men,  and my correspondent adds     that  whenever His kajesty oan find time to visit industrial centres,  the     effect is felt at once.   Ho adds, however, that there should bo more     publicity about these visits, especially in the  town whore the visit  takes     place.          One cannot help being struck with the very strong feeling among  the     overseas troops for the maintenance of the Throne,   There seems to be a     sense of personal devotion as well as a strong conviction  that the Empire,  of     which they form part, must have a hereditary head.  &apos;THE ALBERT HALL MEETINGS Oil NOVEMBER 3rd AND 1-th.        As a good  deal  of publicity has been given to tho mooting  on  the 3rd,  at   which violent revolutionary  speeches wore made,, it may be well  to  point out   that though it  was  labelled  as a mooting of tho national Union  of  Railwayman,   it was  in reality convened by the Herald League of George Lansbury,  and the   railvaymon present  wore mostly members  of that League, Lansbury fearing that   the Hall would  not  be  granted to him if he applied for it in his  own name,   Mr. J.H. Thomas was  not a  little concerned to find himself in suoh company,   Mr. Ramsay kacdonald  was  one  of the speakers, though ho was not reported in the   newspapers,        Tho Albert Hall  was  hired  by Mr, Henderson on the  11th, but I am informed,   on good authority,  that  several thousand of  the tickets  - 3ome say eight   thousand - were distributed  to  that class of people in London which shrinks fromHo. .26.                                            13th November,  1913,
     tho shedding of any blood but that of thoir  own countrymen.   Tho  speeches     v/ere comparatively mild3  far  too mild for a  majority of  the audience, who     shouted the speakers down.   That, and an overflow meeting outside the Hall,     degenerated into a sort of anarohist demonstration,          Two much importance  should not be attached to those two  meetings, be-     cause they were,both packed for /the purpose  of advertising the  views  of what     is happily still a minority of the working class,  but the;; do indicate the     existence of serious unrest and disquiet among working men.          I understand that tho management of the Albert Hall may  refuse to grant     the use of the Hall to Mr. Lansbury for the  meeting advertised  for November     23rd.   The original object of the meeting was for Lord  Parmoor and Lord     Beauchamp to speak on the League of Nations  and President Wilson&apos;s policy,     but this was afterwards changed to a meeting for Labour  and the League of     Nations, with Lansbury in the Chair.                                          *UNEASINESS AMONG LABOUR.          There was a strong feeling among workmen that -he Government  should     not relax its control over factories until a year after  Peace was  signed.     They had a real fear that the employers would treat thorn with -scant justice     during the period of reconstruction, but this fear seems to have been     relieved by the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that wages would not bo reduced     for some months.          Among the aims of the extremists is a plan to extinguish Trades  Unions     &quot;because they encourage class distinctions&quot;.   As Gallacher  said in his  speech     at Barrow on the 9th, &quot;Trades Unionism is dead, and it is for you to  concen-     trate on the Shop Steward Movement or the \7orkers&apos; Committee  as we have  it     in Glasgow.&quot;          There is a movement among the Trades  Unionists to  force the Government     to repeal the Defence of the Realm Regulations.          The Woolwich Arsenal Shop Stewards are  said to be permeated with Bolshevik     ideas, and the distinction between the firebrands among Shop  Stewards and     the Russian Bolshevik is a fine one.          Among the older Trades Unionists there appears to bo a strong feeling     that the Government should rodeen its pledge to restore the pre-war Trade     Union conditions.   The question of modifying then to meet new  conditions can     be considered afterwards.   They also feel that the suggested unemployment     money should be kept down to the lowest limit, beoause if a large &apos;number of     ex-soldiors and civilian workers are left idle on  this kind of  temporary &apos;     pension, thore will be trouble.          There is also a very widespread sense of irritation against the Pension     Ministry at tho lack of elasticity and the delay in dealing with hard cases.
D.R.R. IN RESPECT OF PROHIBITION OF TREATING.          Many of ny correspondents point out  that the  time  has  now  come  for     repealing the prohibition against treating,    In many parts it  is  already a     dead letter, and the men feel it to be a  great infringement of  liberty.     Nothing would make the Government more popular at  this  moment than an     immediate repeal of this Regulation,THE LONDON WORKERS &apos;  COMMITTEE.          Among the  strongly revolutionary societies is the  London Workers&apos;     Committee which held a nRe-union of Rebels&quot;  at the Old  Bell Inn, Holborn,     on November 9th, to commemorate the first anniversary of tho Russian     Revolution,THE RELEASE OF JOHN  MCLEAN.          There have been several meetings in  Glasgow during the last few days to     advocate McLean&apos;s release.   Gallacher made  a very revolutionary speech  last     Monday,   &quot;If the German Kaiser has to abdicate, we must see to it that     George Guelph or Windsor goes the same road&quot;.   Elsbury, an I.W.W. man said     &quot;Give me tho workers of the Clyde behind  ne, and I will undertake  to get     McLean out of prison within a week.&quot;   Fairchild, of the British  Sooialist     Party, urged the workers to strike, &quot;Strike  no1&quot; -  for the revolution and for     John McLean,&quot;THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.          During the course of an action brought  by the Treasurer of the  Inde-     pendent Labour Party against the Editor of the &quot;llkeston Pioneer&quot;  for libel,     it transpired that the membership of the  Independent Labour Party  was 50,000.     The defendant was alleged to have said that  he had not  the  slightest doubt     that some of the money was coning from Germany,   The jury found for the     defendant with costs,LABOUR AND THE PEACE CONFERENCE.          A strong move is likely to be made within the next few days for passports     to be granted to representatives of Labour to meet the  fellow Socialists from     all the belligerent countries at the time and place of  the  Peace Congress, and    &apos; the Government will have to decide how this  demand is to be mot.   If the     Allies had still to deal with the German  and Austrian Imperial  Governments,     the meeting of the International would not matter  very  much, but when the     German and Austrian delegates will in all probability be themselves  members     of the International, the matter becomes  serious:  for,  when tho Germans  desire     to press for a point which is not being conoeded,  they  will endeavour to put     pressure on the Allied representatives through the Socialists attending  the     International.  Moreover, every trifling difference bfetweon the  Allies will be     reported to England and distorted by the  Labour Press,  and incalculable  harm     may be done,   A firm announcement that no one but authorised delegates  will     be allowed to visit Paris during the negotiations  cannot, it is submitted, ba     made too soon.
      Eventn have  been moving  BO  fast  that  it  is difficult to keep in teuch vrith French opinitr..       On the whole, the  position seems to be very much the  same  as it is in England  - a tremendous wave  of emotion and enthusiasm about the Armistice and  So far,  no  indication of  any oarping abuut the terms.    Even before the Germans had  betrayed their intention of applying to Marshal Foch,  it had  been  noticed  tha&quot;:  the optiminm  of the men on leave had  brought the spirit of the civilian  population to its highest point.      There wa3, and is,  material for  discontent.   One  million tons of coal are  lying at the ports for  lack  of trucks to carry them into Paris; food profiteering is reported to be scandalous; maximum prices are n*.,t uniform,  and eggs,  butter, milk  and veal are  beyond the means of any wall- to-do people.   It is said that  lives could have  been saved during the influenza epidemic if eggs and milk had been  available.  -              :      The  prolonged agitation  for higher wages on  the part of the metal workers of Havre is arousing  a very strong feeling against Capitalists, which is  only in abeyance because of  the present  Peace  celebrations.   On the  other hand, the Socialists are  said to be plaoed in a dilemma by the attitude  of the Socialists recently liberated at  Lille, who hold the very strongest views on the prosecution  of the  War to  its end,   Longuet is said to be losing ground by his extravagances,  for his doldier supporters are very unlikely to listen  patiently to  his favourable references to Enemy Socialists,      There appears to be the  warmest  feeling  towards the Allied troops, and particularly the British.  Three recent actions  have touched the French deeply, and have done probably more  good than  any  propaganda - the placing of General Raking&apos;s pennant on the  statue  of  Lille, the gift of a wreath by Lord Derby, and the action of the  British  Commander  who asked the French regiment to precede him in his march into  the recaptured city.      The  applications for the new YJar Loan have surpassed all expectations.      It has been noticed that the civilians in the liberated tovns and&quot;villages  have lost their former  frugality, perhaps because they have been fairly well fed by Relief Committees  for so. long.  They are lavishly consuming the coal left  behind by the Enemy,  not  realising that when It is finished  they will get very little  for  the rest of the  winter.      There is a good  deal of  uneasiness about the Bolshevik tendencies in Austria and Germany,  partly because Bolshevism is believed to be infectious and partly because the Allies have  no settled Government with which to treat.     . There has been a little  cooling  off in,the enthusiasm of the French for the Americans.   This may be duo  partly to the slowness of  the American advance in,tho  Metz  sector,  but there is behind  it the  fear that Americans may oapture more than  their share of French trade after the War, and some  soreness at  what the French  have  regarded as arbitrary
                                    m, g m     proceedings in the matter of starting works  near the  ports without waiting     for authorisation from the French Authorities.HOLLAND.          A well-informed correspondent in Holland reports the rapid  growth  of     Bolshevism, and hints that a revolution is quite possible if  something  is not     done to furnish the country with food and&apos; coal.    He  suggests that if     England would take the lead in this, a wave  of gratitude would sweep the     country.BOLSHEVISM IN DENMARK AND SWITZERLAND.          The Governments of Denmark and Switzerland  are now embarking on     repressive measures against Bolsheviks,   The notorious Bolshevik Minister     Salkind and some thirty of his &quot;Staff&quot; have  been deported into Germany,     The Bolsheviks in Scandinavia are reported to be planning a propaganda     campaign in England, supported by a considerable sum of money,   Great  care     will have to be exercised at the ports to prevent the importation of leaflets     and pamphlets and the landing of undesirable persons, for at  present it seems   -  as if the infection of Bolshevism would overspread Europe, and run its  course     like any other malignant disease, unless proper  measures are  taken to     isolate the source of infection,ITALY,          I hear from the Italian Military Intelligence that the Italian  Government     is very apprehensive of the spread of Bolshevism,   It is believed that many     of the returning Italian prisoners of war have been infected.   The  present     proposal of the Government is to put them into Concentration  Camps and  try     to find work for them.   The Socialists are for  the moment  quiet, in view  of     the popular enthusiasm over the victories, but when this has  subsided,  it  is     feared that Bolshevism may boil up again,          Italian opinion is much exercised about the Versailles Conference,     A report has been circulated that the British Prime Minister  pushed  the     Southern Slav claims in the teeth of Sonnin*s and Orlando.          The Vatican is reported to be very nervous, its chief  anxiety being not     its international position, though that is not reassuring,  but its fear of  a     revolution at home.   As Cardinal Gasparri said the other  day, &quot;\7e do  not     like Revolution,   ^he Vatican has too many windows looking on to the  street&quot;,     At Trent, released Russian prisoners were distributing Bolshevik propaganda     among the Italian Regiments, urging them to set fire to stores and magazines.     Some of them were immediately shot.   On the other hand, the  Socialist  Deputy     Mcrgari laughs at the idea of Revolution,          Until the country settles down after the recent events,  it  will not be     possible to toll from day to day what line the extreme Socialists are  likely     to take,                                             B.H.T.                                                                       5D10-11-,t
