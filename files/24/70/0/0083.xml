     DR. MACKA1AARA thought that tho question should not he rc-opened.    Hehad taken th  sense of the nom.nl-ftno fit the last Mooting,  and with tho exception of Mi&apos;.  $orster hn* ^mbprs.had/agreed to tho phrase  &quot;overseas&quot;.  Mr.  Forster had certainly  dissented,  hut since then had agreed in  the answer given m the  House that evening by lir. Bonar Law to the use  of  the  phrase  &quot;overseas&quot;.     SIR CHARLES HARRIS Said that  in the absence  of  Mr. Forster he  could not  carry  the matter further, but  ho  wished to make it  clear that  in  the present  condition of  the  Army Record Offices,  it was  a  physical  impossibility  to  pay  the higher scale to  all men who  had served overseas  Within  the time desired.    He thought  it  a pity  to  wreck the demobilisa- tion scheme  for  the sake  of  a  few  men.    DR.  MACNAiilARA said  that  the facts  stated by  Sir CharlesHarris  had  already been before  the Committee, and that  theWar Office  representatives had  agreed  to  pay on  the  lower scale  in the first instance  in  ail cases  where it was not possible to pay  the high&apos;  -  scale at once,&apos;  and to remit  thobalance  later *   He instanced  the  ease  of  a man  of  the  three Services say at  Gibraltar:   it  was not  defensible to pay twoon  the  higher - ,e oale and the  third  on  the   lower.    THE  CHAIRMAN, while admitting  that  he  had had the casecf  the men  sent  to India  mostly in mind,  thought it wasn&apos;t?t possible to  re-open the  oiiestien.&apos;   He reverted to  the point  whether it would he possible to  discriminate  men  whohad served  overseas for only a  brief  period.    SIR  CHARLES  HARRIS  said  that the  difficulty  to  whichhe had  alluded would be   even  greater  in  such a  case.   TheAcquittance Rolls did not show  how long  a man had been overseas.   It would be necessary, therefore, to look up  -., the Military History &apos;of each man,  which  would mean  throwingthe work on the  Record Offices.    He  recognised  the  anomaly of  paying all men on the  same basis irrespective..of the length of their ,service abroad, but the  anomaly  was  not so great  as that of paying men  on  the higher scale  who had never  served in  a theatre of war.    MAJOR BAIRD  agreed  that  it  was equally impossible  fcr  * the Air Force to distinguish actual periods  of service overseas.    &apos; THE COMJIITTSB decided&apos; that:-   .          (a)  it was  not  possible  to  differentiate   .         between men  according to  length of  service        .. overseas .          (h)  the  former  decision  to-adopt the phrase          &quot;overseas&apos;1  as  the/basis  of distinction  for         payment on  the higher scale  should be adhered to.     The statement  for circulation with the Votes was     then approved.   (See  Appendix).

Theculty that if these workers would putPAYMENTSTO MEN ONDEMOBILIS -AT ION,GRATUITYCIVILIANCLOTHES.      SIR CHARLES HARRIS stated that no record could befound in tha war Office of what Sir Auckland Geddes had stated,  and he suggested to the Committee that the matter should be disposed of as follows     It should be laftto the Minister of National Service to make good his case to the Treasury, and to obtain authority from that department to authorise the equivalent payment out ofCivil Votes, in order to honour the pledge given by lord derby.      THE COM IT TEE agreed.(4)   TiiE CHAIRMAN adverted to the fact that it had beendecided at the last meeting to pay the Gratuity through thePost Office Savings Bank.  As he understood it, this meant that the man would not get his money for about amonth,  Meanwhile he would only have his 10/6d. a weekand Ration Allowance to depend on.      SIR CHARLES HARRIS pointed out that ration allowance would be some 14/6d a week  that Separation allowance would continue to be paid and that the man would also have received, on dispersal, a sum to provide himself with a suit of civilian clothes.  This sum might be between 50/- and  3.0.Od. and he would not be expected to spend it until the end of the month, as he was entitledto wear uniform for one month after discharge.      MR. JAMES pointed out that existing authorityprovided only for a sura of 30/- for tha civilian suitof clothes.gratuities to regular officers.      SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that it would certainly bemore than that though no decision as to the amount had yet been arrived at.      THE COMMITTEE recommended that all three departments should consider the matter with a view to a uniform amount ,for civilian slothes being paid in cash to the members of  jeach Service.      SIR CHARLES HARRIS then submitted proposals for pay-ment of gratuities to the regular officers of the Army,(Paper No.105.)  He said that the matter had been discussed!at the War Office, and that these proposals were^pW^for-ward now as a basis for discussion.                                                           I      DR.MACNAIiARA pointed out that in this statement the phrase &quot;theatre of war&quot; again appeared, and that the scale I proposed was lower than that provided in Article 497 of the pay Warrant.
m 4 -    SIR CHARLES HARRIS replied that it was generally recog-  Inised that the provisions of Artfolev 497 of the Pay &quot;Warrantwere a most unfortunate blunder in the aiTCumatajoftea of thepresent war, and that, in any case, there was a marked difiVJerence between the case of the temporary officer and theregular officer: the temporary officer had to re-establishhimself in civil life - the regular officer remained in the profession of officer, and had an assured position in theRegular Army.  As regards the phrase &quot;theatre of War&quot; this of course would be corrected to agree with the principleadopted for the men18 Gratuities.  Sir Charles also explain-ed the provision relative to an officer who has served as a soldier in a theatre of war coming under Scale &quot;B&quot;.  it provided for the case of a man who had served for say threeyears as a soldier overseas, and had then been selected for a Commission, but whose time to go out as a draft hadnot arrived.     THE COHMITTEE found that the provision was eminentlyfair and reasonable, but deferred discussion of the Schemeuntil their next : eoting.     DR. MACNAMARA undertook to submit a Scheme forgratuities to men of the Navy at an early date.  Thedecision of the Board of Admiralty was under consideration as to the method of treatment of men of the permanent Navy,m SCHEME)R gratuities-iS,
