The French  Government  shall  immediately transmit to  all the  signatory  or adhering States  a certified copy of the notification  and Act of Adhesion, indicating the date of receipt.                                    ARTICLE 50.   ,      The present Convention shall take effect, for the States which participate in the first deposit of ratifications, sixty days after the  date of the protocol of the deposit, and
     for the States which ratify or adhere to it afterwards, and the colonies, possessions, or     protectorates  not mentioned  in the  ratifications,  sixty, days  after the  notifications     specified in article 47, paragraph 4, article 48, paragraph 2, and  article 49, paragraph 2,     have been received by the French Government.                                       ARTICLE 51.         If one of the contracting  States wishes to denounce the present Convention, the     denunciation  shall  be  notified in writing to the  French  Government,  who will     immediately communicate a certified copy of the notification to all the other States,     indicating the date of receipt.         The  denunciation, which cannot be made till two years after the date of the first(55) deposit of ratifications,  shall apply only to the State which has notified it, and one     year after the notification has reached  the French Government.         After two years from the date of  the first deposit of ratifications each State will     have the right to summon a conference to revise the Convention, and, in default of an     agreement, the present Convention will terminate if its prolongation is not voted by a     majority of the  contracting States.         Done at               and in one singie copy.ANNEX (A).                NATIONALITY AND REGISTRATION MARKS.

ANNEX B.[Note. This Annex will be referred to a Technical Committee for revision.]RULES RELATING TO  AERIAL NAVIGATION.          (Article 31 of the Convention.)                         1. Regulations respecting Lights.                                   ARTICLE 1.    The regulations concerning lights must be observed from  sunset to sunrise inall weathers, and  during that time no light must be shown which could be taken forone of the prescribed lights.
171                    ARTICLE 2. Lights to be carried by Airships.    An airship under way, that is to say, moving under its own power, must carry:     (a.)  At the bow, a  brilliant white light arranged in such  a manner  as  to throw           an uninterrupted beam over a horizontal arc of 220 degrees, that is to say,           from right ahead to 110 degrees on each side..    (b.)  On  the  right, a  green  light arranged  in  such  a  manner as to  throw an           uninterrupted  beam over the whole  of a horizontal arc of  110 degrees,           that is to say, from right ahead to 20  degrees abaft the beam on the right.    (c.)  On the left, a red light arranged in such a manner as to throw an uninterrupted           beam over the  whole  of  the horizontal  arc of 110 degrees, that is to say,           from right ahead to 20 degrees  abaft the beam on the left.    (d.)  The three lights-white, green, and  red must be  visible in each vertical           plane corresponding to their respective  zones in each direction, comprised           between  the  vertical  downwards and  the  line   as  nearly as possible           approaching to the vertical,  and making an  angle of at least 30 degrees           above the horizontal.    (e.)  The green and red side lights must also be provided with shields or screens,           arranged in  such a  manner that  their  light cannot be seen on the opposite           side.    (/.)  The white light must be visible at a distance of at least 4  kilom. and  the           green and red side lights  at a distance of  at least 2 kilom. on a dark           night with a clear atmosphere.    (g.)  An airship shall, moreover, be provided with the means of showing occasionally           a white light astern if overtaken by another aircraft.               ARTICLE 3. Lights to be carried by Flying Machines.    The rules relative to lights are, in principle,  applicable to flying machines, but, asa temporary concession, they  need only  carry a single lamp  or beacon,  arranged insuch a manner  as to show a green light to the right and a red light to the left.    The angles of visibility in the  horizontal must be those laid down in the case ofairships.   So far as the  angles of visibility in the vertical and the minimum radius ofvisibility of the lights  are concerned, it is simply recommended that the regulationsprescribed for dirigible  balloons be followed as closely as possible.                 ARTICLE 4. Lights to be carried by Free Balloons.    Free balloons  must  always carry ready for use a  white  light, which  must bedisplayed on the approach  of another aircraft.                               II.--Audible Signals.                                    ARTICLE 5.    (a.)  During fog, mist, snow, or heavy  rains  aircraft must, by day as well as by night, make use of powerful, discontinuous, audible  signals.    (b.)  In the same circumstances, free balloons  must also make use of such signalswhenever they  are in the neighbourhood of motor-driven aircraft.    (c.)  The above regulations only apply to flying machines so far as is practicable.                              III. Rules of the Road.                                    ARTICLE  6.    A motor-driven aircraft must always keep at a distance of at least 100 metres from another aircraft in every direction, whether  horizontal, vertical, or oblique.                                    ARTICLE  7.Motor-driven aircraft must always make way for free balloons.  [500]D
                                    ARTICLE 10.     When two motor-driven aircraft meet head on or nearly so, following opposite oralmost opposite courses, at altitudes which only differ slightly, so that a collision is tobe feared, each must turn to the right so as to pass the other on its left.                                    ARTICLE 11;     Notwithstanding any of  the  rules laid down  in  the preceding articles,  everymotor-driven aircraft overtaking another must steer clear of the latter&apos;s course.     An aircraft overtaking another  is an aircraft which nears another on a course which meets the latter&apos;s wake at an  angle of more  than 20 degrees that is to say,which is in such a position in regard to, the  aircraft which it overtakes that  it  couldnot, at night, perceive either of the latter&apos;s  side-lights.  No later change in the positionof the two aircraft can  make the aircraft which overtakes the other considered  to becrossing the latter&apos;s  route, in the sense of article 8, nor can such change relieve it from the duty of steering clear of the  latter&apos;s course until it has absolutely passed it.                                    ARTICLE 12.     Whenever the necessary manoeuvres are  not  specified in the preceding rules, theaircraft which have to manoeuvre can  do so vertically as well as horizontally.od 3S*UI.U IBIIIW ti&apos;ihCii  TTJLDW  &amp; -.-.:  -ARTICLE 13.  ,        , -     In case of  imminent collision, the two aircraft must manoeuvre as best they can.In particular, the highest must try to ascend and the  other to descend.     When  they are on  the same level, and crossing one  another, whichever sees theother on the right  of its  own course must *ascend, and the other must descend.X&apos;l     imf  AS      T \        \    ,  . ARTICLE 14.                     rtbaml  (Wj:--&apos;!.:.:  When  a dirigible balloon has  stopped voluntarily, it must display a conspicuousblack ball; it is then subject to the. same rules as an aircraft under way.     Jf it,is no;longer under control owing to a.breakdown of any kind, it must displaytwo conspicuous  black  balls placed vertically  one above the other;  it will then betreated as a free balloon.     At night, in  both cases, it shall only display a white light, and shall be treated asa free balloon.                         IV.

When, in accordance with the above rule, one of the aircraft has to change course,the other must keep its own course  and maintain its speed.                                     ARTICLE  9.     Every motor-driven aircraft which, in accordance with the above rules, has to give way to another aircraft, must, if circumstances permit, take  care  not to cross in front of the other aircraft.
    Note. The following four recommendations were inserted at the end of the DraftConvention of Paris (1910) for the purpose of putting on record the views of particulardelegations, although at the time the provisions proposed  had not been accepted aspracticable by the Paris Conference as a whole :                                 Recommendations.    In addition the Conference makes the following recommendations :     1. That  the Governments shall endeavour  to indicate by clearly visible marks           certain points which can be  used as land-marks by aeronauts, and which           should be placed  on  the  ground,  or on  buildings  such  as  railway           stations, &amp;c.    2. That  the Governments shall mark visibly and uniformly, high tension electric           wires, and the supports  of aerial cables, and shall indicate  their position           on aeronautical maps of the same decimal scale in each country.    3. That the  regulation of radio-telegraphic communication between aircraft, the           earth, and  ships, as  well  as all  questions  of technique  and financial           adjustment, shall be submitted  to the forthcoming London Conference on           radio-telegraphy.    4. That  the Governments shall study the question how far it would be useful           to set up an International Board for Aerial Navigation, and consider  what           powers should be conferred on such a Board.    (o.)  In case of  distress, when above  land or sea,  an airship must, so far aspossible     By day, display a triangular red flag on  the  underside of the car, in  addition tothe two superposed black balls mentioned in article 14.    By night, wave or flash a white light, and at  the same  time  extinguish the sidelights.    By day as well as by night, it can, in addition, make use of an audible  signal.    (o.)  A free balloon in distress must            By day, display a triangular red flag on the under-side of the car;  and           By night, wave a white light.    By day as well asjby night, it can,  in addition, make  use of an audible signal.
173     Memorandum for the War Cabinet to accompany  the revised draft of the International Convention as to Aerial  Navigation. 1.    The  printed  draft which accompanies this memorandum is based upon  the Draft  International Convention of  Paris  (1910). It  was found  impossible &amp;t  that date  to secure agreement &quot;between the contracting Powers on the main issuo of  sovereignty in the air space over national territory as  affecting the  control and admission of  foreign  aircraft.  Since that date the original draft has been considered by (l) a Sub-Committee  of the Committee of  Imperial Defence in 1913 (2) the Civil Aerial Transport Committee in 1918 (3) the Air Council in  1918 and (4) by  an Interdepartmental Conference held at the Air Ministry on November  6th  1918.  At this conference representatives  of tho following departments were  present viz- Air  Ministry, foreign Office, War Office, Admiralty, Homo Office,  Board of Trade, Colonial  Offico,  India Office, Treasury, Post Office and Board of Customs and Excise.   The revised draft as now presented embodies suggestions and amendments  made by the Committees and Departments above named. 2.    Attention is drawn to  certain main points of principle which arise in  relation to  this draft Convention.      (a)  The  doctrine of national sovereignty is  clearly asserted          by  way  of preamble.      (b)  Subject  to this assertion Chapter III (Articles,19 - 25) is          drawn so as to restrict as  little  as possible tho free          navigation  of aircraft from an international aspect.      (c)  It has been  thought advisable in Article 43 to preserve definitely  the rights of each contracting State in  the  air space over its  territorial  waters. 3.    Attention is also drawn to certain main points in which the present draft differs from  the draft  of 1910, (in so far as the latter  was then agreed  to by the  contracting  Powers.)      (a)  The  nationality of the owner is taken as the sole criterion for determining the nationality of aircraft. (See Article 3.)(2),  Certificates of  navigibility are to be  based on a  system which requires only that the aircraft shall  be certified as belonging to  a navigable type.  (See  articles 11 - 13). (3). Six  articles of  the original draft are  omitted which specified particular  matters in which restrictive regulations could be imposed, it  being  considered preferable to leave each state  free to provide by domestic  regulations  tho necessary safeguards  for  its  own security and that  of the lives and property of its inhabitants. (4)  A new  Article (44) is suggested, embodying  the principle of  mutual indemnity between States for damage done  in their respective territories by aircraft of  other States.  Effect  would  be given to this principle by a system  of compulsory State insurance.

177CIVIL   AERIAL   TRANSPORT   COMMITTEE.(IE     INTERIM  REPORT  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  AS  TO  THE  INTERNATIONAL                         ASPECTS  OF  CIVIL  AERIAL  TRANSPORT.  To the Air Council:-      1.  By our terms  of reference  we were  invited inter alia to consider the development  and regulation  D  civil aerial transport  from an  international standpoint,    We have been informed by the Foreign Office  that in the opinion of that  Department, if  it  is desired to set on foot negotiations for the  conclusion of an  nternational  Aeronautical Convention, no  time should be lost in approaching  certain Allied and friendly  Governments.   We  therefore think it desirable to submit an Interim Report on this branch of our subject  AT once.      2.  At  the outset  of  our enquiry we found it necessary to divide the  subjects covered  by our terms of  reference  under various  heads, and to  refer  these different heads to special  committees for  detailed inves-  igation.   One of the branches of enquiry so  referred comprised  international  and   legal   problems,   and  Special Committee No.  1, who have dealt  with these problems, have presented a report*  which, as far as  it concerns international  questions, has  generally been approved by us.  We think it will be found convenient  hat we should enclose herewith  this Eeport  in  its entirety, and that we should draw attention to  certain  salient  points which seem to us  to call for emphasis or comment.    We shall deal in a further report with  the latter part of the report of Special Committee No.  1,  which is  concerned with  questions of municipal  egislation.     3. It  will be observed that the Special Committee,  in  considering the  first part  of their subject, have  taken as a basis  the  Draft International Convention drafted  by  the  Conference held  at  Paris in 1910  Appendix  A to their  report).  This Conference was unable to complete a draft convention for  ratification  by the Contracting Powers, mainly owing to a conflict  of  opinion between the  British and  German dele-  gations  as  to the right of each State to the  sovereignty  (or to the exercise  of  control and jurisdiction,  whichever  term be preferred) in  the air  space over  its  territories.    In  our  opinion  this question  of  sovereignty is one upon which agreement between the Contracting Powers  is vital in  the  future interests of  civil  aerial  transport.     4. It is a question on which it is possible  to hold  different opinions :  indeed, some divergence of view  with regard to it has manifested itself on our Committee.   It must,  of course, be admitted that a State  must  assert some rights  of sovereignty  in the air space over its territories, since otherwise  no legal control  could be exercised over aircraft in flight at however  low an altitude, but  it  is  possible  to  take the view  either (a)  that  State Sovereignty should be asserted  usque ad coelum, or  (b) that State sovereignty  should be  asserted only up to some prescribed  level of altitude, above  which the flight of aircraft would  still be practicable, and that above that altitude the  air should be free to all,  just as the high  seas outside  the limits of territorial waters are free to all.     5.  From  the  purely  business  point of  view  of  the prospects of civil aerial transport in times of peace, the latter view  has much to recommend it.    The commercial advantages, of  air traffic are to be expected mainly from rapid uninterrupted  flights over  long distances, and these advantages  would be clearly best secured if aircraft above a certain altitude were  allowed to fly freely in any direction without let or hindrance imposed upon  them by  the  municipal  legislation of the  States over  whose  territories  they might pass. It has to be borne in  mind, moreover, that  the geographical position of the United  Kingdom places it at a disadvantage with countries in  Europe  over which British civil  aircraft will  wish  to fly.  British  air- craft  have,  therefore, more to gain by being allowed  to fly freely over the territory of foreign countries than foreign  aircraft have  to  gain by  being  allowed to  fly freely over the United Kingdom, so that  the doctrine of  State sovereignty in the  air space  limited  to  a prescribed level of altitude,  if  internationally agreed upon, might well be in the  best interests of British civil aeronautics.    G. The argument,  however,  for the doctrine of  State sovereignty in the air space usque ad  coelum, is in the main a military one.   Military considerations dictated  the  opposition of the  British delegates to the proposals  pressed by  the German representatives at the Conference in Paris in 1910, and we understand that the views  of the Foreign Office  and of  the naval and  military  advisers of the Crown are unchanged. To  give  to  foreign  aircraft, as a matter of acknowledged international law, the right  to fly at will over the territory of  the State would be to give them undesirable opportunities for espionage, and  generally to limit  the elementary right  of a  State  to take each and every measure  which  it considers necessary for self- preservation.&quot;!   In time of  war, moreover,  the doctrine  of the &quot;freedom of  the  air&quot; above  a  certain altitude  would  give  rise  to  most  embarrassing questions for neutral States.   They would actually  be exposed  to  the risk of having aerial battles fought over their territory without being able to claim that ;heir neutrality had been  infringed.   The case of the upper air presents no true  analogy to the case of the ligh seas outside the limits of territorial  waters.    7. The  experience of  the present war has  merely served to  increase the force of  these considerations, and we agree  with the Special Committee that the doctrine  of State sovereignty in the air space  usque ad coelum,  on which this country  acted  before the war, and on which, along with neutral countries, it stillUll,  is sound, and should be adopted  as the basis alike  of  international agreement  and  of  municipal   slation.    8. As far  as the doctrine of sovereignty may be applicable to territorial  waters,  we agree  with  the conclusion of the Special  Committee that the  air space  over such waters must be considered from the same2C2221384243* SCO APPENDIX 1. P. 20.F FOREIGN OFFICE MEMORANDUM ENCLOSED IN DESPATCH TO H.M.&apos;S REPRESENTATIVES ABROAD OF 29TH JULY, 1910.                                                           \
point of view  as the air space over  the land of the State.    We desire,  however,  to  point  out  that  thequestions  of sovereignty over and of any extension of the  limits  of  territorial  waters are  primarily  the concern of the Admiralty, and  that  military rather than civil considerations must be  regarded as of major;importance in this connection.    9. While we hold the view that in principle a claim to full and absolute sovereignty  in  the air spaceis  a necessary preliminary  to any  negotiations for an  International  Convention,  we  think  it well toemphasise the advantages of a liberal policy in regard to any regulations  which may  be made  applicableto  foreign aircraft, provided that by such a policy equally  liberal treatment can be obtained for British  air-craft flying over foreign territory.    The reasons for this view are those already set forth above in paragraph5.    While we recognise that foreign aircraft landing  in  this  country  must   be  compelled  for  Customspurposes and the like  to land at prescribed places, we think that every  effort should be made to secureinternational  agreement to arrangements  whereby  passenger and mail machines on regular through serviceswishing to pass over the territory of  a foreign State or States, and not wishing to  land,  should not neces-sarily be compelled to land, so that long-distance flying may not be unnecessarily hampered.    10. We approve the detailed conclusions of the Special Committee set out  in Appendix  A to theirreport.    The technical regulations contained in Annex  C of  the Draft  International  Convention   (seeAppendix  A)  were referred  to Special  Committee No. 2 of our Committee, and we further approve their detailed recommendations.  Recent developments in the science  and practice  of aeronautics  have rendered necessary  some  amendments  of  regulations agreed to in 1910,  more particularly since such regulations were at  that date considered from  the aspect of the use of airships rather than  of aeroplanes.    11. In paragraph  10 (i) of Part I. of their Report  the  Special  Committee have  touched  upon   animportant question which was not considered  by the Conference held in Paris in 1910.    We think  thatthe possibility of  damage done  by  foreign aircraft visiting this country is  a  matter for careful considerationwhen it is remembered that,  unless an aircraft is itself damaged,  the owner of it is  in a  peculiarly advan-tageous position as regards escape  from the legal consequences of his act.    We  agree with  the  SpecialCommittee that, if some  system of insurance could be mutually arranged between the Contracting Powers,or at least between H.M.G.  and the States whose aircraft  are  most likely  to visit  this  country  and  overwhose territories our own aircraft are most likely to fly,  such  an  arrangement  would be of distinct advantage to civil aerial transport.    12. Having regard to paragraph  10  (ii) of  the Report of Special  Committee No.  1,  we hold a strongview  that some international agreement  which  will permit of the utilisation  of aerial routes  immediatelyafter  the  war is of urgent importance for the purpose  of encouraging civil aerial transport, and that there-fore early steps should be taken to  enter  into the necessary negotiations.    13. We have  recently received a request for our  views upon a draft Postal Agreement proposed to bemade between the  Postal  Authorities  of the United Kingdom and France respectively, which has  been putforward by the French  Government.   Under  this draft Agreement, a translation of which is  attached,it  is proposed to organise a regular aerial  mail service between London and Paris.    14. We  approve of this  draft Agreement, but we  are of opinion that, though its terms do not appear tobe  inconsistent with  any International  Convention that may be come to  on the  lines suggested in theearlier paragraphs  of  this Report,  it would be  preferable that the terms of such an International Conven-tion should be agreed  upon before an organised  scheme of postal services actually comes into operation.   AnInternational  Convention  must of  necessity deal with  the whole  subject of  aerial  traffic, whereas a postalagreement of the  kind  proposed only comprises the specific terms of a contract for a particular purpose.The former must therefore implie*dly govern the latter.

THO TWO ADMINISTRATIONS ARE AGREED THAT THERE ISA CASE FOR  ORGANISING BETWEEN PARIS AND LONDON  A REGULAR
178service for the conveyance of mails by aeroplane.  They willfix later the date on which the  service  is to commence.  ARTICLE  2. The aeroplanes  will carry  both official and pri-vate correspondence.  The conveyance is restricted to letters and  postcards, ordinary or  registered,  up to  ?  maximumweight which will be fixed by the detailed  regulations.  ARTICLE  3. The sender of an official or private letter to  be conveyed  by  aeroplane between  Paris and London  must payable fee of 3 francs per 15 grammes or fraction  of 15 grammes.  He is  at liberty  to register his letter on payment of the fixed registration fee of 25 centimes.  ARTICLE  4. Aeroplane letters are concentrated at the pointof departure by means of the fast services at the disposal  ofeach administration,  or by special services organised for thisptirpose.  Beyond the point of arrival of the aeroplane the aeroplanoletters,  according to their destination, can  bo  sent  by thoordinary  means of transport of  the Postal Service through-out the whole territory of France and of Great Britain.  Aeroplane  letters  are delivered to their  ultimate destina-tion  by express; the office of destination,  however,  has the option if it wishes of replacing the express service by anotherequally  speedy method of delivery.  ARTICLE  5.  The prepayment of aeroplane letters at the ratesfixed  by  Article 3 gives  them,  without additional  charge,the right of  free conveyance and of express  delivery as do-fined by Article  4.  Each office,  however,  has the  option, laid down  in  Article13, paragraph 3 of the Universal Postal Convention, of lovy-ing a surcharge for express delivery when the aeroplane letteris for delivery in a district where there  is no express deliveryoffice.  ARTICLE  6.  Unless  other  arrangements are  made each  ad-ministration provides for one  half  of the  service, either directly or by means of  contractors, at its option.   If for any reason the service  is carried out by one  administration  onbehalf of  the other,  the latter shall repay to  the former thecost  of  the  journeys provided on its behalf.  ARTICLE  7.  Subject to the division of the working costs pro-vided in  Article 6  above,  each administration retains thewhole of the  fees received by it in respect of correspondencecarried by aeroplane on the  lines specified in  Article  1  ARTICLE  8. If the contracting  administrations establish in-ternal  aeroplane  services,  arrangements  shall  be  made between  them  to enable the sender to pay before despatchthe charge for retransmission by one of these services, thecharge to HT  credited to the office concerned.   ARTICLE 9.  The two administrations are at liberty to admit passengers on the aeroplanes performing  tho service.   They are free from all responsibility in respect of this conveyance, which is at the sole risk of  the  passenger, who must himself effect any insurance  which  he  think  proper.   Within the limits of a  maximum charge mutually agreed upon, each office fixes the fare for the services which it carries out.   ARTICLE 10. The two administrations  fix  by mutual agree- ment (1) the points of departure and arrival of the aeroplane service to be established between the two countries, and also, if necessary, the intermediate stopping places; (2) the dates and times of departure and arrival of these services.   They fix by mutual agreement all other detailed regulations  for the carrying out  of the  present Agreement.   ARTICLE 11. The terms of  tho Conventions and arrange- ments in force between  the  two countries, and in  particular those of tho Universal Postal Convention signed at Rome on the 2Gth May,  1906, arc not affected so far as they are not contrary to the  terms  of the  present Agreement.  This Agree- ment shall come into  force on its  ratification and  shall ter- terminate at the  same time as the  International Convention above mentioned.   The duration of the present  Agreement,  however, can be extended beyond  this term  by agreement between  the  two contracting administrations.   Moreover, each administration has the option of terminat- ing it before the term  above mentioned on giving the other at least  6 months&apos; notice in advance.   ARTICLE 12. The present&apos; Agreement  shall be ratified,  and the Acts of ratification exchanged as soon as possible.

                                           CHAPTER I.                                  MUNICIPAL  CONTROL AND LEGISLATION.    1. The  necessity for some legislation as to aerial transport  is  sufficiently  indicated  in  the report  olSpecial Committee No. l.t  We adopt the view of that Special  Committee in  approving  the general linesupon  which the Aerial  Navigation Bill  (see Appendix B to  their  Report) is  drawn.    Before proceeding to a detailed consideration  of  its  Clauses we offer the following  general observations.    2. We think that the claim to full and  absolute sovereignty should be emphasised in the preamble to theBill for the  reasons already suggested in our Interim Report.    3. The  Bill itself is drawn in such a manner as to leave  to  Government Departments power to issueregulations and to clothe them with a considerable discretion as to the scope of these regulations.   The bill as drawn has taken the  Merchant  Shipping Acts as the model  for many of its Clauses, E.G., as to registration!certificates of airworthiness, and  collision regulations.   For this reason it is proposed in the Bill that tinHome Office should  be  responsible for general regulations as to  flying and for matters in which the police are concerned, and the  Board of Trade for  adminstrative regulations of the kind indicated above.    4. The  Special Committee have expressed a definite opinion that all the powers and duties of regulatingaerial transport should be assigned  to the Air Ministry.  This proposal offers certain advantages in groupingin one Department officials  and experts responsible for the issue and administration of regulations, whichin the present case must to a  great extent be governed by naval  and military considerations.    As an illus-tration, it is only necessary to refer to the close  connection  between  prescribed  landing places  for  forejfljaircraft and  prohibited areas.   As against the  proposal the analogy of railways and shipping seems logic!!to point to the desirability  of  assigning aerial transport to the Government Department primarily concernedwith trade and commerce,  i.e., to the Board of Trade.   If  the former  view,  which   we  consider  the        * THESE FOLLOW THE FINAL REPORT AND RESERVATIONS as APPENDICES I.-VII.  ON PP. 10  ET SEQ.

CIVIL   AERIAL   TRANSPORT   COMMITTEE.                        FINAL  REPORT  OF   THE   COMMITTEE.TO  THE AIR COUNCIL.                                          INTRODUCTION.    1. Tho terms of reference under which  we, the Civil  Aerial Transport  Committee,  were  appointed  areas follows :-    To consider and report to the Air  Board with regard  to :    1. The steps which should be taken with a view  to the  development and regulation after  the  War o!        aviation  for civil and commercial purposes from  a  domestic, and  imperial, and an  international        standpoint.    2. The extent to which it  will be possible to utilise  for the above  purpose tlie trained  personnel  and        tho aircraft which the conclusion of Peace may leave surplus to the requirements of the Naval  and        Military Air Services of the United Kingdom  and Overseas Dominions.    2. As  explained in paragraph  2 of  our Interim  Report on International Questions, the subjects coveredby  these terms of reference were of such a  wide character and required so  much detailed investigation thaiwe  thought it advisable to divide them into five headings, which  were referred to five  Special Committees,These headings were broadly as  follows :    1. Questions of Law and Policy.    2. Technical and practical  questions as to the possibilities  of  performance  of  aircraft  and as  to  the        requirements of aerial services.    3. Business questions relating to the position of the aircraft manufacturing industry after the  war,  the        probabilities of the establishment of aerial transport services and the steps which would be necessary        for the maintenance of this  industry  and for the development of these services.    4. Questions of Labour arising in  the aircraft manufacturing industry and  in aerial transport services,    5. Problems  of scientific research  and the special  education of expert designers, engineers, and  pilots,The successive chapters of this Report follow the above headings.    3. These five Special Committees have all presented reports to us, and these reports have been care-fully  considered.   They contain the results of  much  labour  and careful enquiry,  and  though  our general conclusions in the present report may not always be wholly in agreement with those expressed in the SpecialCommittees&apos; reports, we have attached them  as * Appendices to this Report, in  the  belief that they will be oigreat  assistance to the Air Council in the study of the  various problems connected with civil aerial transport,    4. In view of the fact that our Interim Report on International Questions dealt with the  first part of the  report  of Special Committee No.  1, it  would seem the most convenient course to commence the present report by setting out  our conclusions on  the problems  of  municipal control  and legislation treated of in  thesecond part of  that  Special Committee&apos;s report.   Many of the regulations which will govern aerial transport will be applicable to foreign aircraft as well as to our own, and regulations of  this  character should, in  theevent  of some International Convention being arranged, be in accord with the terms of such Convention.
   referable one, be adopted, some  legislation in  extension  of the Air  Force (Constitution)  Act,  1.9.17,  would     in  to be necessary to enable the Air Ministry to create the organisation required to deal with civil as distinct   roni  military flying.      5. The Clauses of the Aerial  Navigation Bill itself have been closely examined  by Special Committee   Co. 1.   We do not propose to deal with them seriatim, and think it better to state that, generally speaking,   abject to two modifications noted below, we approve of  the detailed conclusions arrived  at by the Special   omniittee.      6. Of the  general  regulations contemplated  in Clause J,  those  which will  prescribe  prohibited  /ones   md landing  areas for foreign aircraft arc probably tho most important.    We have already referred (in our   Interim Report&apos;, paragraphs 5 and 9) to the desirability of liberal treatment in the  admission  of foreign   lircraft to this  country.      7. The  Bill adopts as the criterion of British nationality in  the  case  of  aircraft  the nationality  of the   wner.    (See Clause 2.)   Probably  the most  difficult  problems as to nationality will arise in relation to.   ownership by companies, and we  desire to draw  particular  attention  to  the recommendations  of  Special   Committee No. .1  as to  the conditions on  which aircraft owned  by Companies should  be deemed  to  be  British aircraft.   The provisions  as to registration  do not call for comment.      8. We note with approval the recommendations  of Special Committee No. .1 as to limiting the necessity  for certificates of airworthiness (see Clause 4 of the  Bill).   The Clause as originally drawn would involve the  possibility of individual aircraft being subjected to stringent  tests  and  examinations, which in  our  view  would be unnecessary, and which, to be of  any use, would require to be repeated at very frequent intervals.  The question is one of considerable importance, since the recognition of  foreign certificates in the case of  international flying  is a matter which must be dealt with in  any International  Convention.      9. As to certificates  of  competency for navigators (see Clause 5), we find ourselves not in entire agrec-icment  with  Special  Committee  No. 1&quot;, who in their report approved Clause 5 of the  Bill as  originally drawn.  We-think that, while it should be obligatory on all navigators  in  charge of  aircraft carrying  goods  or  oassengers to possess certificates  of  competency, and  while the appropriate Government Department should  have power  to require certification of navigators in all cases, it should be  left to  such  department to  decide  whether or not certification of navigators of, e.g., private aircraft should be  enforced by regulation.  It seems  o us that the safety of the public will probably be sufficiently  ensured by the interest of the private  navi-  gator in acquiring  sufficient skill to ensure his own safety. Since certificates of competency will be required  on  all occasions when aircraft of  any kind are  used  in  flying over foreign territory, the number of private  navigators not taking out certificates will probably be small, in the  event of no regulations being  issued  applicable  to them.    The absence of obligatory certificates, in the first instance, in the case of the private  navigator, seems to us to be reasonable in the interests  of the early development of civil flying.      10. The  collision and signals  of distress regulations, to  the provision of which Clauses 0 and 9 of the  Bill are directed, have already been  referred to in Paragraph 10 of our Interim Report.  We have approved  tho view  there  expressed  that  the collision  rules of  the Royal  Aero Club should be taken as a basis for the  collision  regulations.    Signals of  distress regulations  are at  present  the subject  of expert enquiry.  In  view of the  fact that regulations of both  these kinds  must  be  discussed  primarily from  the international  point of view, we do not think it advisable to offer recommendations  of  a  more  detailed nature than  those  contained in  Appendix A  to the  Report of  Special Committee No. 1.     11. The  recommendations  of  Special Committee  No. 1  as to regulations relating to identification and  aircraft papers  (see  Clauses  7  and 8  of  the Bill) and as to Clauses  10 and  11 of the Bill do not appear to call for  any comment.     12. Clause 12 of the Bill is of the greatest importance as affecting the  general rights of landowners in the air space over their land.   This right  has generally been recognised in English  law to  extend usque ad coelum, and,  although some  authorities  have held that the right only extends, to a  height  sufficient for the reasonable enjoyment of the land, any application  of the usque  ad  coelum  doctrine in its entirety  would be fatal to the development of aeronautics.   The  Clause as  originally drafted in the  Bill relieved the owner of aircraft from liability for trespass in respect  of his flight  over land in the  British Islands, but preserved the common law rights  and remedies of persons in respect of  injury to property or person caused by the aircraft or  by any person  carried therein.    We agree with Special  Committee No.  1  that the  clause does not proceed far  enough in  determining the respective rights and liabilities of  the owner of  aircraft and the landowner, and we  adopt the suggestions of the Special Committee to extend  the provisions of  the Clause in the  manner indicated in their report.   These  suggestions may be looked  at from  two  points of  view, viz., the remedies of persons on land for trespass or material damage to their property and their remedies for nuisance.     Admittedly  persons  on land are  practically powerless  to  ensure  their own  safety  by  precautionary measures against damage caused by the fall of aircraft  or  of objects  carried  therein.   It  is  a  matter of some doubt  whether  under existing principles of  law persons  suffering such  damage  would be  called on to prove an affirmative  case of negligence or intentional  trespass.    It  is  possible  that the Courts might hold aircraft to be within  the class of those  things which  the owner keeps or  uses at his peril.    We think it preferable  that the principles  applicable should be defined by legislation rather  than that they should be left  for solution by a  series of judicial decisions; we  think, too, that as  far as damage done  by aircraft is concerned the deprivation of the landowner of  what is almost  certainly an existing  right of  propertyshould be compensated by what will be in effect an insurance of himself and his property against such damage. Nor do we think that in practice the  expense of insuring himself against third party risks  will prove  very   densome to the owner of aircraft.    As  affecting the question of nuisance or trespass to the property of the landowner in the air space above his land, we  have given careful consideration to  the possibility of defining  some altitude, flying below which would involve a civil liability on the owner of aircraft.    We have come  to the conclusion that to attempt to prescribe any such altitude is impracticable,  and that it will be  sufficient to protect the landowner by giving him a specific right of action for damages for actual nuisance caused in  breach  of flying  regulations in  themanner suggested by Special Committee No. 1. Since nuisances by aircraft are most likely to  arise in connec1
tion with the ascent from and landing at aerodromes, we recommend that special attention should be paid tothe flying regulations applicable to such ascent and landing.    13. We  do not desire to add anything to the recommendations  of Special  Committee No.  1  as  toClauses 13-22 inclusive and Clause 24 of the Bill.    14. With regard to Clause 23, which defines, as between the United Kingdom and the remainder of theEmpire, the extent to which the provisions of  the Bill are to apply, we desire to emphasise alike the import-ance of uniform legislation, so far as possible,  throughout the Empire on aeronautical matters, and of avoiding any appearance of dictating to the Dominions  or of infringing in any way  their  local autonomy.    In  ourview, the clause rightly applies universally throughout the Empire the provisions of an international charac-ter-namely, those relating to registration, collisions,aircraft papers, and signals of  distress---and  we hopethat H.M. Government will take steps to circulate the Bill, in the form  in which they may themselves adoptit, to the various Dominion and Colonial Governments, so that  the  latter may have an  opportunity of con-sidering whether they will adopt it,  with or without modifications to suit local conditions, for their own terri-tories,  and, if  so, of expressing their views as to  the  means  to  be employed  for  applying  it  to  those territories.    15. In the  remaining paragraphs  of their Report  Special Committee  No. 1 have  dealt  with various questions  relating to aerodromes.   We  approve their recommendations, and we would emphasise  the sug-gestion  made in paragraph 11 of Part II. of their Report that  the clauses necessary to give effect theretoshould  be added to the Bill.                                             CHAPTER II.Technical and Practical  Questions as to the Possibilities of Performance of Aircraft, and as to the Require-                                        ments of Aerial Services.    1. The reports of Special Committee No. 2*, which are primarily concerned with the practical possibilitiesof aeronautics from a scientific and technical point of view, are in the main of so highly  technical a character as to make them unsuitable for detailed examination in this Report.  Attached to them will be found  a series ofappendices, the general effect of which has been summarised,  so far as it appears  possible to summarise it, bythe Special Committee.  We desire to record our view that the detailed reports  contained in these appendicesrepresent the results of  much  experience and of much research by those most competent to express authori-tative opinions on the subjects with which they deal, and that the conclusions at which they arrive are based upon the  most reliable data ascertainable at the present time.    2. We  agree generally with these conclusions,  and strongly support the view that the carriage of mails,of passengers, and of certain  classes of goods by  aircraft will present no difficulty from the technical pointof view.  We are  confident that demands for  aerial services to provide such carriage will arise immediatelyat the conclusion of  the war,  and that it  is imperative that every endeavour  should  be  made  to  prepare for these demands.    3. It is scarcely necessary to point out the extreme importance to this  country of being first  in thefield in  the matter of aerial transport.  We concur  with Special Committee No. 2 in thinking that an experi-mental  service should be organised as early  as possible, but this  recomniendation should not be understood as implying that all other aerial services that may be suggested should  await  the final results of the experi-ment.   On the contrary, we think that special measures should  be taken, whether by direct State effort orby the  encouragement of individual enterprise, with the object of commencing the schemes of transport men-tioned by Special  Committee No. 2 at as early a date as possible on the conclusion of the war.    4. Owing to the absence of any reliable data to serve  as a  guide,  it has  been impossible for SpecialCommittee No.  2 to frame any estimate of the running costs of  aerial services under peace conditions, andconsequently of the Volume of aerial traffic likely to be forthcoming.  The reasons for their inability to dealfully with this part of their subject are  clearly given in their final report, and we recognise that they areconclusive,  and that no good  purpose would  have been served  by putting forward  estimated figures of run-ning costs which, from the nature of the case, would necessarily have been almost wholly  the results  ofguesswork.   Nevertheless, it  seems worth  while to draw  attention to  certain  considerations affecting thematter, if only  with a  view to  pointing out the factors which must limit the costs of aerial services if theyare to hold their own in competition  with alternative means of transport, and which are likely to limit thedemand for them.    5. It is necessary to distinguish with  reference to alternative  means of transport (the alternative meansbeing surface transport) between developed and  undeveloped countries.   In developed countries the govern-ing advantage of aerial  over surface transport must be speed.   The extent  of the advantage will  vary withthe effectiveness of the alternative means, but  where alternative means exist it must be assumed that theywill be  improved and rendered fully effective.  In  undeveloped countries the advantage  will  lie with themeans of transport  best calculated to provide access to points  previously inaccessible, and the absence of road or railway communication must add vastly  to the commercial  importance of the  ubiquitous  flightwaysof the air.  In the case of countries in  or between which surface transport facilities are interrupted, as, forexample, where there is the interruption of  a sea passage, both the factors above mentioned  should operate to the advantage of aerial transport.    6. In the  paragraphs which follow we  have regard chiefly to developed countries where aerial transom:!is called on to eclipse the speed of surface transport.                                                    \J    7. High load  and speed are antagonistic  elements in  the problem.    To secure high  speed, the  com-merciai  load must  be kept  within  narrow limits.   From the figures submitted  to us it would appear not to exceed  25 per cent,  of  the total loaded weight of an aeroplane.  That is to say, that the loading efficiency* See Appendices II. and III. p. 43, 68
 pr  the  ratio of  useful load to gross  weight in an aeroplane is only poor.  On this account it would seem as though aeroplane transport  must always  remain auxiliary to surface transport, and that speed must always be  in the end the predominant factor  of advantage.     8.  Comparing  the train  with  the  aeroplane, the train  as  a  traffic unit of movement  is large.   There must, therefore, be wider intervals of  delay  for the accumulation of  loads between successive units than in the case of the aeroplane.  The  aeroplane is a small unit, and therefore a flow of urgent traffic  can be given by a constant succession of units from the aerodrome,  with  consequent time  economy.   The  aero- plane affords the better time-saving the longer the journeys, because in long journeys the time lost between the home and the aerodrome is a  less appreciable factor; the saving  of time from speedy flight only counter- acts this loss for journeys in  excess of some minimum distance.     9.  The absence of a track  is a  great financial advantage.  The expenses standing in lieu thereof are far less, viz.,  the cost  of  landing grounds, wireless installations,  weather-reporting services,  and signalling of routes at night or in fog.  The-cost of landing grounds will only be a small factor per &quot; aeroplane mile &quot; in any reasonable  commercial  scheme  of transport, but as aeroplanes  become  increasingly  reliable  the  need for alighting grounds will  not be  wholly removed, since safety is a paramount condition ; moreover, multiple- engined machines, desirable  as they are from the point of view&apos; of  safety, are commercially justified only when the loads are great enough to warrant aircraft of this size.     10. In canvassing the traffic expectations of the immediate future, a distinction may be drawn between passenger  and goods traffic.     Passenger traffic divides itself into two distinct sections, that which  moves for business and that which moves for pleasure.  Business traffic will turn primarily on speed and reliability,  and  will consist of  inward and outward traffic where rapidity  of  movement is an  important consideration.    Economy of time  is of great importance to many business  men who find absence from their regular place of work disadvantageous. As  it becomes possible by aeroplane to fly 400  to 500 miles out and home within the day, and to give a  reason- able interval  for the conduct of business between  the flights, so it  becomes  likely that many business men will avail themselves of the opportunity.     The occasional  use of single machines for rapid journeys  in any  direction  rather than  along  a  fixed route, carrying occupants  who pay special  fees for the high speed,  will  probably be  one  of the early and increasing lines  of development.  It will educate the public and prepare  them for regular services.   This  could be  undertaken immediately peace comes, and would not be open to  the  same objection  as any  premature attempt to run a daily service to scheduled time.     With  regard to passenger traffic  generally, the  question of safety in connection, more  particularly, with aeroplanes will be of the highest  importance.   The large number  of accidents which occur at the present time are, in our opinion, chiefly due  to inexperience and taking risks during  training and  practice  which would not be justified in ordinary times.  This subject is no doubt constantly  before the authorities in the experimental departments  connected  with aeronautics, and  investigations are, it  is understood,  being con- stantly  made into the cause of accidents by  the  Accidents&apos;  Investigation Department of the Air  Ministry. Improvements  are  continually  being  made  with  the object of  reducing accidents,  and in  the ordinary course of events it is not too much  to expect a large reduction in  their number at the  conclusion of the war.    Thus the chief deterrent  to  flying becoming universal  will   be  removed  without  any  remarkable invention being made.    11. Pleasure traffic  will depend  on novelty, comfort and  safety.   Flight  may afford pleasure in itself, but pleasure traffic  will be seasonal  in character, will depend largely on weather, and will be more costly the  more irregular it is.  There is  likely to be small regular  demand,  which  will grow as  flight movement becomes a habit.  The demand  in the  immediate future  will probably not be extensive, owing to  the  cost, but it would appear  practicable to open routes from well chosen centres.    12.  Goods traffic will be for (a) mails and (b) general goods.   Commercial considerations are not the only ones to be  taken into account in determining upon an aerial  mail.   It  is  not indispensable that the cost of a letter by aerial mail should be fully borne by the  service, if Imperial or other reasons demand that the  use  of aircraft shall thus be developed.  Mails offer  a most promising  class of traffic, because the  load to be carried is reasonably uniform, the  weight small, and the  demand  for speed great.  The  prospects of an aerial mail will be best when the conditions referred to in paragraph 5 above as operating to the advantage of aerial transport make themselves most markedly felt.    It has been  shewn in the interim report of Special Committee No. 2 and in Appendix E appended  thereto that in the case of services between London and large provincial  towns  a  flight of at least three hours, at an average, say, of  100 miles an hour, is required for the  speed of an  air-mail service to reveal itself,  and to offer a sufficiently marked  saving of time over land transit; on an oversea  journey, such as  the passage to Dublin, the saving of time  is much more evident.   It  would aopear necessary to charge some such fee as Is.  or more per letter  for an inland air-mail to prove  remunerative.    The cost of electric cable communication,  say, to Johannesburg, at  8 10s.  per 100 words (a message taking about 24 hours to reach its destination), can  be  contrasted with  the cost,  say  2s.  6d., of sending  a letter of 5,000 words to the same spot in six days  by aeroplane.   The London  mail could  in the future be^^eyed to Calcutta in four days, as against  16 days, the minimum  at present.  These instances  illustrate the  intrinsic utility of air  services, apart from the  value of making  closer links within the Empire  and of giving support to the construction of aircraft so as to be ready for war  emergencies.    It is more difficult to settle the reasonable expectation of general goods traffic,  which must take the  formof express parcels, usually  of small weight. Furs, lace, jewels, precious metals, extracts, essences, valuable feathers, etc., might be carried  by air  because of their high value; also rare and  out of season fruits and
ing*01nicire01vegetables,  (lowers, and perishable articles generally.  Newspapers  and periodicals afford scope for aerialservices, because news grows stale quickly.  Drugs, dyes, chemicals, medicines,  optical  and surgical  andother instruments  will ho  so  carried, as often these are wanted quickly.  Wherever, for want of some articlelife is endangered or industry is at a  standstill,  as where some spare part or tool  is required  for a machine, . p.the aeroplane will  afford the quick remedy, and its flight will be profitable.  Cinematograph films,  gruino- ,phone records and  commercial samples may figure in the  class of goods  carried by  aircraft.    Their radistribution will quicken exchange,  and this will react to increase the volume of traffic,  but the whole seriesof illustrations above  given  tends only  to  show how limited the total volume or weight of  aerial goods trafliis likely to be in developed  countries.                                                                      1^1,    13. The technical  appendices to  the reports of Special Committee No. 2 contain interesting information&apos;  j,(as to  the respective capacities of the airship and the aeroplane.   We think it advisable to make some  general    1comparison,  from  the commercial point of  view, between the two classes of aircraft based upon this infornia- &apos;tion.  Dor this purpose the largest type of  airship is taken as an example, since it is found that as the  size of an-airship increases  the ratio  of its useful load to gross weight  improves, eg., for  a ship of sixty tonsgross, thirty tons  of  disposable  load are  available.  This  represents roughly nine  times  the load carrying  ^capacity of the largest  modern aeroplane.  The prime cost per lb. of disposable load in the case of  an  air-  &apos;ship is estimated at almost one-half the prime cost per lb. in the case of an aeroplane.   The  economic limit of the journey, without landing is about DODO  miles  in  the  ease  of an airship,  as against 500 miles in  thecase of  an aeroplane.   The airship,  therefore, has the advantage of a greater load  capacity; but its speed,  ^under present conditions  is slower, being probably  not more than 60 in.p.h.  In this respect the performance  ^of the airship on overland  routes would  appear in general to be open to keener competition from rail transport on the  other hand, on sea routes the  airship will, save in  contrary  winds, have  a marked advantage oversteamships as to speed.  As compared with the  aeroplane, the cost  of handling and  housing airships  will liehigher,  and. until  open air mooring is fully developed,  the   regularity   of  airship  services   will  be more  r,adversely affected  by high  winds than that  of aeroplane services.   In journeys in which speed is not the mostmaterial factor, and particularly  where  passengers are being  carried, and safety is consequently a paramount  j,,&apos;consideration, the  airship  offers  advantages over the aeroplane in the  way  of  comfort,  ease  of navigation.  wcapacity for  safe flight at low altitudes,  and high ratio of disposable load.    14.  On  the  question of landing grounds along aerial  routes,  there  was some divergence of opinion in  tlSpecial  Committee No. 2,  and it will be observed that the interim report of that Committee is only signed lijjjMr. Holt Thomas  subject to  a reservation  on this point.  While we agree  with the majority of the  SpecialCommittee  in not  feeling  able to recommend that chains of landing grounds should necessarily be laid outj  S(at  regular and  comparatively short-say ten-mile-intervals  along  aerial   routes, especially  in  developed countries,  we  consider,  nevertheless,   that  the  advantages  of  lines  of  landing   grounds  on  certainmain routes hereafter  to be   laid  out  would be   very  great,  and  that  such  lines   would  largely  .assist the development of civil  aerial  transport.   In  undeveloped  countries  regular chains  of  landing    ,grounds  at  suitable  intervals   along aerial  routes  will be indispensable;  and  in  such  countries  the    .consequent expense, will be less  material in view of the comparative advantages  which aircraft will enjoy inF  1competition  with other forms of transport.   Regular sea stations for the landing of aircraft are at the outsetessential  if trans-oceanic aerial  transport is to be  seriously  attempted.   It is recommended that when ques-tions of laying out, maintaining  or abandoning landing grounds for military  purposes have to  be considered,regard should be had, if possible, to the probable needs of civil aerial transport hereafter.   The establishmentof landing grounds within urban areas should not necessarily be precluded, and the institution  of rapid transitschemes between aerodromes  and toAvn centres, such as  Dost  Offices, would be of great  value.  developments in aeroplane design may permit of landing  safely and conveniently within a narrow  compass in  the future; amias has already been indicated, a central situation for an aerodrome  for  civil aerial  traffic has considerable;:importance.     15.  We recognise, however, that military considerations must override all others, and, though we have!necessarily  dealt  with our subject matter mainly  from a commercial point  of view,  we would emphasise-the importance : first, of the need that all established  commercial air routes with  their aerodromes and land-:  ^ing places should  be suitable for strategical and tactical use in the event of war; and, secondly, of the need&quot;(for the rapid convertibility in the same event of some  types of  commercial aircraft to military uses.  \\tdo  not offer  detailed suggestions on these points, which appear to be peculiarly within the province of tb(Air Ministry; but we record  our strong opinion that it is vitally necessary, in the interests of national safetythat all air routes established should  conform fully to  military requirements,  and that the development ancmanufacture of types of  commercial  aircraft should  for  a  long  time be governed by the requirement  thatthey  should be  in  some manner of effective military use, and that this requirement should be satisfied everat the cost of a serious diminution in the commercial value of both routes and craft.    1G. With regard to the marking of aerial routes we agree with the practical suggestions of  Special Com;mittee No.  2.  It will be  observed  that the Special Committee do not recommend the institution of a generasystem of marking for the whole country, but suggest that if companies operating commercial routes providftheir own schemes of marking, these should be  subject to some central control for the purpose of  avoiding possible confusion arising from the employment  of different schemes.  We are of opinion that  it will not b(necessary for the&apos;State  to  lay down any definite  scheme for  the  provision  of route marks.  Probable improvements of  signalling by directional wireless and  of other methods of signalling from aerodromes by night antday would seem  to  make it inadvisable to embark upon the organisation  of any universal system of arbitrarymarkings.    17. In  concluding that part of our report which deals with the practical  possibilities of aerial transportwe desire to draw attention to the great importance  of Meteorology in connection  with  aerial routes  and services generally.   The interim report of Special Committee  No.  2 deals more particularly  with  thefjjj^semination of meteorological information, and we propose  to  touch  upon the problems  of  meteorologicalresearch at a later stage in the present report.  The practical suggestions  contained  in  the  interim report ofSpecial Committee No.  2 and in Appendices  O and II to that report  can  be used as a basis for a system ofmeteorological stations which, in our opinion,  should be organised immediately  after the conclusion  of the warThe provision and management of such a system are matters which we think should be left to  the State andnot to private enterprise.It:Hi nrIS&apos; 1
business Questions Relating to the Position of the Aircraft Manufacturing Industry after the  Wat, the Proba-  ilities of the Establishment of Aerial Transport  Services, and the Steps which would be Necessary for the                Maintenance of  this Industry and for the Development of  these  Services.fi   1.  Special Committee, No. 3* were concerned primarily with business questions  relating to the position of le aircraft  manufacturing industry after the war, with  the probability of the establishment of aerial trans--lort services and with the  effect which the  establishment of such services might have on the maintenance of the manufacturing industry.     2.  The Special Committee were  impressed with the importance of keeping alive the.aircraft manufactur-  ng industry in the interests of National Defence.  In order to enable the industry to respond to  war emer-  jencies, they  expressed the view in their first report that the services of the industry should continue  to beEmployed for  the design and development of Naval and  Military aircraft and for the carrying out of  theRational construction of aircraft for the future, and that this would enable the design and construction of air-  aft for civil  transport purposes to grow on  a sound and permanent basis.   At the same  time,  in  their first  port they gave their reasons for believing  that the development of civil aerial transport services reasonably  o be anticipated at the end of the war, if no special steps are taken to foster it, will  not be sufficient to keep  le manufacturing industry alive,  and will not for some  years  to come  involve any appreciable  volume of  &quot;dors being placed with the producers in this country.CHAPTER  111.     3. We see no ground for disputing  this conclusion,  for  though, as we have said in paragraph 2  of Tiapter  IT. of this  Report, we  are  confident that demands for aerial services to provide for carriage of mails, uissengers, and of certain classes of  goods will arise at  the end of the war, we apprehend that, as we have iaid at the end of paragraph 12 of the  same chapter, the total volume of aerial goods traffic to be anticipated vill be very limited,  and that even on the most hopeful view of the  probable extent of the demand for aerial arriage  of mails and passengers, the number of aircraft required to meet it will be small in comparison with he vast  number now  being produced  for the purposes of  the war.     d. The aircraft producing industry  in this country has developed during the war in a phenomenal manner, solely owing to the unexampled demands of the naval and military authorities, and has grown to considerable  intensions in Canada also, where before the war it did not exist.     5, This great industrial organisation,  amply equipped as it  is with capital, material,  machinery, expert  nowledge and trained  labour, is in anything  but a secure position.  Fostered as it has been wholly  by the exceptional conditions of the last four years, it must wither, and very rapidly, in proportion as these condi- ions or  their equivalent  cease to obtain.                                                    r.^,&apos;.,.                           &apos; ...           .     6. We are thus led  to consider a question raised by General R. M. Groves at the  meeting of Our Com- mittee at which  the  first report  of Special Committee No.  3 was presented, the question, namely, of  the importance in the widest national and imperial interests of the development of the  use of aircraft after  the war.  If it appeared  that the public  interest  was not involved in the  continued and extended use of  aircraft, he dwindling of the  aircraft manufacturing industry, with  whatever  hardship  to individuals  it  might  be accompanied, would not  be a national disaster, but we could not  neglect the possibility  that no  less  vital  an interest  than the  safety of the State itself might be concerned in the matter. Accordingly we invited Special Committee No. 3 to report further to  us on the question raised by General R. M. Groves.     7. The supplementary report of  Special Committee No. 3  appears to us to go to the root of the problem, and we  agree with that  report in believing that  the development of civil aerial transport services, in  order to  reate a  market for  the  manufacturing industry and consequently to enable it to  maintain its power of pro-  uction  and of progressive improvement in design, to the  extent and for the reasons  given by the Special Committee, is essential  for the safety  of  the  Empire.  We agree that  aerial transport services cannot  be eveloped by the ordinary commercial  methods so as to secure the required  result, and that State  action of some kind in  developing aerial transport services is therefore unavoidable.          -   &apos;     8, As to the form of State action to be taken, it will be observed  that two main alternatives are discussed by the Special Committee under  the heads of :-     (a)  State assistance to private enterprise.     (b)  State  ownership or participation in the ownership of aerial transport undertakings. The  Special Committee  have not felt able to advise as between the two alternatives; and, similarly, we  feel that  the problem, raising as it does issues  far larger and  graver than at the outset  of  our enquiry we could have expected  to be confronted with, is one for His Majesty&apos;s Government itself rather than for us to deter- mine upon.  The choice involves the  consideration of political questions, labour questions, and questions of.national finance upon which a Committee constituted as ours is, is hardly  competent to advise,  and whichaseem appropriate for  Cabinet decision.  We confine ourselves, therefore,  to  saying that, in our opinion,  the form of  State  action to  be taken may  be either of those described under heads (a) and (b) above,  or even a  combination of the two, but that the decision in the matter  must rest with His  Majesty&apos;s  Government. The  arguments for  and  against each of these alternatives  are  fully  set  out in  paragraph 7 of the supple-. inentary report of the Special Committee.     9. In  paragraph  5  of their  supplementary  report the  Special Committee gave a  picture of the. extent of the development of aerial transport services which should  be  aimed  at.   We  agree  with their view  and* Sec Appendices IV. and V. pp. 70, 73.t See Appendix V. p. 73.
desire to emphasise the importance of a general scheme of  main air-routes being planned in advance, so thaiwhen aerial services come to be put into actual operation  they may be in harmony with the scheme.    10. While considerations of national security afford the all-important reason for advocating State action for  the development  of aerial transport services, other advantages, also to be  hoped for  from such develop.ment,  should not be overlooked.   Among the most important  of  the  national  benefits to be hoped for artincreased facilities for friendly intercourse  with  foreign nations,  and, still more, the  improvement in  intercommunication between the widely-scattered countries which  make up the  British Empire.  So  far as theGovernments of the  self-governing Dominions and of India are concerned, it  will be for those governments to whom copies of this Report might,  we suggest, be forwarded, to determine their own attitude in regard tithe problems presented by  the subject of our  discussions.  Whether  they decide  themselves to   run  orjoin with the British Government or each other in the running of aerial services, or not, it is in any case to be hoped that by arrangement with the British Government  they mav be  willing  to  give  all necessarjfacilities for the arrival and departure of British aircraft.    Such facilities  would include the provision olaerodromes and landing places or the grant to  the  authorities controlling British aerial services of the  rightto acquire them for themselves.  The Dominion and Indian Governments would, we  hope, also  be willing,unless they were running State-owned aerial services of their own, to allow the British authorities to tenderto their Post Offices for the carriage of their mails,  and generally to  operate in their  territory  on the samtterms  as their  own citizens.  It  has already been shown  that the longer the distances which it is desired tocover  rapidly  the  greater are likely to be the commercial advantages  enjoyed by aerial transport for sucipurposes as  the carriage of  mails as compared, e.g., with  rail and steamer transport, whence it appears thatthe Dominions and India, owing to their great  geographical  area and  the wide distances which,  in  manycases,  separate  their  imuortant  centres of population, offer a  fruitful field  for the development of  civilaeronautics.    11. It requires but little imagination to envisage the possibilities of aerial communication   in such jcountry as Canada, where the journey from Halifax to Victoria is one of nearly 3,000  miles, passing tlirouglsuch  centres  as Quebec, Montreal,  Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver, or  in Australia,where a journey round the coast from Brisbane to Perth, through  Sydney,  Melbourne,  and Adelaide is slightly longer,  or in the Union  of South Africa, where a journey from Capetown to Johannesburg  is outof 800 miles, and leads on to Buluwayo or Salisbury, and  thence  across Northern  Rhodesia, and  what wasonce  German East Africa,  to British East Africa, the Nile Valley, and Cairo. It is  obvious how importanta bearing the improvement in inter-imperial communication is likely to have  on that greatest  of problems,the problem of  the future relation to  one another of the self-governing States of the British Empire.    12. We are of opinion  that in  all  matters of inter-imperial aerial  traffic,  as, for instance, in the formula-tion of such a scheme of main  aerial routes as is referred to in paragraph 9, in  so far as these routes extent1beyond the limits of  the British Isles, joint or co-operative action by His  Majesty&apos;s Government and titGovernments  of the  Dominions and  of  India should, wherever possible, be secured.    13. In the  case  of the Crown and other  Colonies and Protectorates, the British Government is in Jposition more directly to  control the development of civil aeronautics and to secure the facilities  in the wayolaerodromes, landing  grounds,  and the like, that it requires for the transport in which it may be interested.In  many cases  the Crown  and other Colonies and  Protectorates, being of great geographical extent, offer thesame favourable opportunities for  aeronautics that we  have noticed  in  the case  of  the self-governinjDominions and India.  Some of their governments may be disposed to assist the formation of aerial transport companies or to start  aerial services of their own.  These would be matter for settlement between them andthe British  Government, but it seems to the Committee to be likely that  such services would be valuablein many remote parts of the  British Empire,  not  only for postal,  but for general administrative work, whilethe setting up of  organisations of  this kind would form valuable links in schemes of long-distance servicesconnecting the  United Kingdom with other parts of the Empire, and would, moreover, encourage the design and building  of special types of machines suitable for use, e.g., on large rivers or lakes.  In all countries, inwhich other  means of communication are  few and difficult, aerial services  would  be particularly valuablefor purposes of  exploration  and survey,  owing  to the remarkable  developments brought about by  the war in the art of aerial photography.  The apparatus used has reached so high  a degree of perfection  that map-making,or the correction of maps already made, by means of aerial photography should  present  comparatively little difficulty.  Aircraft should also provide a valuable means  of aiding research  in zoological and other physicalsciences in many  parts of the world.  In setting up aerial services in remote parts of the  Empire the  state should, we think, if necessary, assume  the duty of providing such  landing  facilities and of marking suclroute? as may  be  necessary for certain  main lines.   The  acquisition of the necessary land would  not, exceptin and near large  towns,  be a matter of any great cost or difficulty.    14.  So  far as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  is  concerned,  we  desire to  lay  the strongestemphasis on the necessity, to which Special Committee No. 3 have called attention in the last paragraph oftheir  supplementary report, of an early decision.  To postpone  decision until after  the war might well 1*to  allow  the  manufacturing  industry to languish  for lack  of   orders, and  thus  to  lose  the   means ofcarrying  out  any  policy  that  might  eventually  be  determined  upon.   If,  therefore,  His  Majesty1!Government  accept  our main  proposition that the fullest possible  development of civil  aerial transport services  immediately after the  war  is a national necessity,  and that  it  cannot be  achieved  withoutState  action,  it will be necessary  for  them  to settle  at once what form  that action is to take.   If itis  to  take  the  form of   assistance   to  private  enterprise,  it  will  be  necessary  for His Majesty1&apos;Government to enter into communication with the  promoters   of  such   enterprise,  and   to  satisfy themselves  as  to  the  sufficiency of their proposals.   If  it is  to take the form  of  direct State ownersliifof  or  participation in aerial transport services,  it will be necessary  to settle  precisely what services  arebe  undertaken, and  to prepare in  advance all the measures necessary for bringing  them into  operation^&apos;mediately on the  declaration of  peace.   In either event, the negotiation of  a Convention, at any rate withour Allies, as  recommended  in our Interim Report, and. probably, the arrangement  of agreements with theDominion and other Governments of the Empire, to  regulate inter-imperial  and international  flying,  wou^seem to be indispensable  preliminaries to action, and should, we venture to suggest, be taken in hand as soonas possible.
ionop.are;ertheits to toascirv ol                                           CHAPTER  IV.  Questions of Labour Arising in the  Aircraft Manufacturing Industry and in Aerial Transport, Services.    1. Special Committee No.  4,* who were concerned with labour questions connected with the productionand use of aircraft,  have submitted  a  majority report,  and a  minority report signed  by the  chairman,Mr. II. Oh Wells.    2. We find ourselves in agreement with the majority&apos;s conclusion (from which Mr. Wells does not dissent)that there are no  distinctive labour problems specially affecting the industry of aircraft production as such,capable of being differentiated from those great problems connected with the relations between  employersand employed generally, and in the engineering  trades in particular, which are at the present time receivingsuch close attention from  other  bodies  better qualified to deal with them than we are.  Similarly, we agreewith the majority of the Special Committee that  the case is the same in regard to the  labour to be employedin aerial transport services, which, for our present purpose, we feel can hardly be differentiated from labour em-ployed in other transport services. Nor  do we feel that the manufacture and the prospective civil use of aircraftgive rise to special problems peculiar to  themselves in connection with the education, in the ordinary sense of theword,  of the  workpeople engaged therein as distinguished from expert designers of aircraft and flyers whosetraining is discussed in Chapter  V. of this Report.    3. With a view, however, to  securing that pride of craft on the part of the workman which  is universallyrecognised as desirable  in the  aircraft industry,  in common with all other industries, we desire to emphasise the necessity for co-operation  between  employers and employed in order to establish mutual goodwill, under-standing, and sympathy in their common enterprise.  We recognise that much has already been done in thisdirection, but we consider that further development and systematisation are necessary, and that theresponsi-bility for  this further development rests  in the first instance mainly  with  the employers.    4. It is hardly within our  province to attempt to indicate what precise steps should be taken towards the desired object; but we would venture  to suggest that the popularisation among  the  persons occupied in theindustries concerned with the  production and use of aircraft of the great achievements and  still  greater possi-bilities of aeronautics is  specially worthy  of attention.    5. The question of the employment in aircraft manufacture  of discharged soldiers and sailors, which is dealt with in Mr. Wells&apos; Minority Report, has, we observe,  been referred to another  body, viz., the TradeAdvisory  Committee (Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades),  whose  report (No. X. of the  &quot;Reports  uponOpenings in  Industry Suitable for Disabled Soldiers and  Sailors &quot;)  has  been issued  to  the public by theEmployment  Department of the Ministry of Labour in collaboration with the Ministry of Pensions.                                            CHAPTER  V.    Problems of Scientific Research and  the Special Education of Expert Designers, Engineers, and Pilots.    1. Special Committee No.  51: were concerned with the problem of research in aerodynamics and meteor -ology, the sciences primarily connected with aeronautics, and with the problem of the special scientific educa-tion of expert designers, engineers, and pilots.    2. Subject to  the following observations, we agree generally with their views and recommendations, andwe desire to lay special stress on  the urgent necessity of  the compilation  of  the bibliography   and treatise,embodying the results of the scientific work which has already been done in aerodynamics, to which they refer in paragraphs 1 to 4 of their interim report.   The material available is voluminous but scattered.   Much ofit  would require for its full interpretation the assistance of various individuals who have originated or directedparticular enquiries;  and, as things stand at present, it is a matter of great difficulty  for a scientific investi-gator to inform himself accurately as to  what has already  been ascertained with regard to any particularbranch of aerodynamical science  which he may be studying.   It is  an indispensable  preliminary to properscientific research  in aerodynamics that  there should be a  complete and reliable  treatise on the subject keptconstantly up to date as the science progresses, and thus  containing in convenient form  the whole body of knowledge available at any  given time.  To  the three  main sources of  existing information  mentioned bythe Special Committee in paragraph 2 of their interim report we should add a fourth, viz., the experience and knowledge of the expert designers now employed by various aircraft manufacturing firms.    3. With regard to the method of  carrying on in the future  fl)  tests and investigations of finished pro-ducts in  the shape of aircraft  engines and sundries, and (2) further research including physical  model  and full scale  research  (the subject dealt  with in paragraphs 6 to 9 of the Special Committee&apos;s interim report), itappears that the choice lies between the work being done either (a) by an organisation such as the contemplatedresearch association of  the Society of  British Aircraft Constructors and Aeronautical Society, which should be financed  by  the Society of British  Aircraft Constructors with the assistance of grants from the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research, or (b) by a Government  authority such as the National Physical laboratory-tory,  directly financed by the State.  We would recommend that the first  alternative be adopted if possible :but, failing that, the second alternative  should be resorted to.    4. With regard to meteorology, while we agree with all that has been said by the Special Committee, we desire to call special attention to the necessity, mentioned by them in paragraph 13 of their interim report, of ensuring co-operation between the Meteorological  Office  and  the Authorities controlling  the  meteorologicalstations in the Dominions.  It is not. indeed, only the self-governing  Dominions  that  are  concerned in  thisrS^er&quot;   ^n^ar work done by the Governments of the Crown and other Colonies and Protectorates may wellbg of great  importance, particularly in the case  of long-distance  routes passing through remote parts of theEmpire,  and we would recommend that everything possible should be  done to  strengthen and increase theefficiency of the meteorological offices of the  Colonies and Protectorates.  It would also be desirable that steps* See Appendix VI. p. 76.t See Appendix VII. p. 81.
 should be taken to co-ordinate the work of the Meteorological Offices of groups of Colonies  and Protectorat geographically close to one another,  as, for example, the East and West  African  groups of Colonies  an Protectorates.  Combined results are likely to be more valuable  than the  unco-ordinated results of the wot of a number of comparatively small stations.     5. In regard to Accident Investigation, while we agree with the Special Committee in paragraph 16 their final report that a distinction may legitimately be drawn between privately owned aircraft and airerai carrying passengers for hire,  we think, nevertheless, that the appropriate Government  Department shoul have power to order an official  investigation to be held,  if it is  thought necessary in the public interest, any case of serious accident,  no matter what class of aircraft may be involved in such accident.  Enquiry might, at the discretion of the appropriate Government Department, be conducted through the agency of unofficial body, such as the Public Safety and Accidents Investigation Committee of the Royal Aero Club  at Aeronautical Society.   It appears to us that the knowledge that a  State authority was empowered  to hold investigation into any case oj serious accident, if it thought fit, would give the public a sense of security,  an would thus be to the advantage of the aerial transport industry rather than  otherwise.  It does  not seci necessary to apprehend that a, Government authority would hamper  the industry  by directing  unnecossi inquiries  into a number of  trifling accidents arising from  easily ascertain able causes.                                  CONCLUDING   OBSERVATIONS.     1. In conclusion we desire to point out  that  preliminary  action  has  already  been  taken by seven of our Allies for  the  purpose of preparing  for  civil aerial transport,  in  some cases by the institutie: of experimental postal services.  It has been reported,  also,  that enemy countries have moved in this dirct tion.  We  consider  it of vital  importance  that the British Empire should not be  allowed to lag bchin other  nations  in  this  movement,  more  especially  as  this might have  a.  very serious effect  upon  tli position of  the Empire  with regard to the  international aspects  of aerial transport.  We would  urge th: there  is  a  large  amount of preliminary work which could be  commenced  at once.   In  Chapters  II III., and  V. of our Report we have already indicated the  urgency  of the  following  matters: Preliminai inquiries as to routes, landing  grounds, and aerodromes, involving in the two latter cases consultation will local authorities; the necessity  for preliminary discussion with the^Dominions and our Allies on  the broadcasting questions  of principle dealt  with in the reports of Special Committee  No. 8; the immediate establishnien of the Bureau in  aid of Research  as  suggested in the report of Special  Committee  No.  5.   We considered   also,  that it  is  a matter  of urgent necessity  to establish  a  system  of  Propaganda  throughout  tl Empire in. order  to convince  the whole nation of the  vast importance  and  possibilities  of aerial  transpo and to familiarise the Governments and the local  authorities with the subject.  There  is evidence of tli initiation of such a system in enemy countries.    2. In  order to  carry out these  views  we therefore recommend  that  a special branch (commencin on quite  a modest scale)  should be formed  at  once for the purposes  specified under the Air  ministry to ensure that all necessary preliminary  action be taken  without  delay-definite responsibility being in posed upon the Air Council.  We would venture, further, to suggest  that  any  executive authority whicl may be established for the purpose would be greatly assisted if an advisory panel  could be formed  of gentle men who have given time and thought, and have expert knowledge of the problems dealt with in our Report and who could be consulted as occasion demanded by the executive authority on questions arising in the conn of its work.    3. The Committee  desire to express their warmest thanks to Mr. Dougal Malcolm, Secretary, Mr. Tindi Atkinson, Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Harper, Technical Secretary,  for the  admirable  manner  in  whitthey have discharged their duties, and for the  invaluable assistance which they have rendered, both to tlSpecial Committees and to the Main Committee, in compiling and drafting their reports.                                    *  Signed by:-                                      f John Baird (Acting Chairman).

I  should add  that I fully concur in the  recommendations contained in the Report regarded solely fromthe point of view of the development of civil aerial transport.&quot;                                                   (Signed) John Baird.                                                                   11/5/18.   * 1.  I think it would be unfortunate if a Report of such importance as that  of this Committee were to golorward  without someone  taking  upon himself the task of expressing an entirely different  groundwork ofwlicy towards  civil aerial transport to that set  out in the Interim Report of this Committee,  confirmed as its by further applications and developments in the Final Report.   We  are in  the midst of a war of which the concluding terms cannot yet be foretold.  It is only natural athis time that  warlike considerations  should predominate in our  minds.   It  is only  natural  that the senseIF insecurity should  drive us towards seeking greater security in great warlike measures.    That we, as alation and empire,  should establish our security upon a  firm  and  self-supported  basis is  accepted  as  aardinal  principle.   But  we are in the midst of a war of which the  confessed object is to make the wholeiforld  secure,  to render the appeal to the  arbitrament of war for the future of less resort and of less avail,ind whether this object will be achieved or not is still unsettled.   Apart altogether from the mere terms which will bring this war to a conclusion, there are reactions grow-ng which will profoundly alter the circumstances of international relationships with the peace. Some factorsa these  reactions are already  apparent and  effective.  There is  the revolution in Russia, the advance in theLOWER of labour, the political arrival of woman.  I think it  is fair to say  that these factors tend towards anttternationalism of a new order, one result of which must be the collapse  and discredit of the  old diplomacy.t is fair to expect that the secrecy of international  negotiations  will be done  away, and with it most  of theaspicion which secrecy always arouses; the system of bargain and counter bargain  will be  largely impossible.The world and they that dwell therein must cease to be regarded as the business assets of national firms.   2. I write  in the spirit of hope.  Such a view of the future  must make the claim to aerial  sovereigntyjvear a different aspect from that  suggested by the Interim Report of this Committee with its annexes.   Theovereignty of  the air is in itself an academic or  theoretical  question.   Each  nation  must be  supposed toIAVE the sovereignty in the air over its territories.  The practical question is the only important  one.   How  the  sovereignty to be asserted and exercised?  Is  each nation to make its own  laws and fix its own rules  d regulations,  and then, by a process of bargaining one with  another, to secure concessions and set up series of more or  less  favoured-nation treaties or conventions, or are the nations as a whole to agree upon \yy  international  code  of laws, with rules and regulations to  follow,  to be applied openly and  equally  I^o all nations upon some mutually  enforceable sanction?  If  causes  of offence are to be removed, the CTRM alternative is the only acceptable one.  I think, therefore, that  in taking any steps towards the  estab- hment of laws or of  rules and regulations  for civil aerial transport at this time care should be taken to avoid y commitments which would hinder the  adoption  of  the second  alternative at  the  earliest favourable oment.  The door  should be left open for  the widest possible conference and the most general  acceptance.* See reservation appended.
    3, There are two  other selfish reasons for this policy :--    (a) The strategic  position of this country  in relation to the air differs fundamentally  from the strategic-         position, in relation to the sea.  So long as the shores of the North Atlantic are occupied by the leading         civilised peoples so long the British position is advantageous as a centre of sea power.  But if  air         power is to usurp to any degree the place of sea, power-and this seems probable so long as flight over         land holds appreciable advantages over flight over  sea.  which  is the  case under conditions  as they         exist to-day-so the position of a country placed centrally  as  regards land  must be  superior to the         position of  a.  country  placed centrally  as regards  water.   The  German  aims  of Central  Europe,         Central Africa,  and the Berlin to Baghdad  approach to Asia are seen  to be the more sound and the         more dangerous as this idea  is carried to fruition.  The very scattered and discontinuous character         of the countries constituting the British Empire becomes  an obstacle to the development  of aerial         transport  and aerial power.   The British Isles are badly placed for  aerial  communication.   Other         nations bar the access  to the great land masses associated to form the British&apos;Empire.  A clear right         of way free from restriction across Prance and Italy and Spain  is essential  to effective progress in         inter-colonial  air  communications.  Our-self-interest,  then-fore, as a great Power lies towards  an         international settlement of  air sovereignty.    (b) And for similar  considerations our interest as a commercial and industrial people must lie in the same         direction.   The right  to  pass across other  national territory  without let or  hindrance,  relief from         varying terms and conditions attaching to flight  which may lie onerous and irksome, the absence of         Customs restraints or  tariff restrictions, and generally  the  absence  of the apparatus for hampering&apos;         or  artificially routing  trade  are all  wanted.  On  all these  grounds  it is submitted that the  case  for         an  international settlement is strengthened.I, therefore, dissent to the somewhat selective and particularist suggestions of  the Main Committee approving.without qualification, the report of Special Committee No.  1.    4. 1  can only  suggest  that warlike considerations equally led to the  decision to  place the control of civil aerial transport with the Air Ministry, whose  prime function   must be  warlike, the  conduct of war or of preparations for war.  The case for civil control of civil aerial transport was submitted to the Main Com-mittee in the following memorandum (except for some slight amendments) :-    (a) Civil aerial transport cannot be discussed apart altogether from military aeronautics.  There  must be         many  aspects which they have in common just as  there must be  many aspects in which they are         opposed.  The policy and outlook of the one  have no necessary connection with the policy and  outlook         of the other.  The control, therefore,  cannot be simple and complete  in a single hand.    (b) The root principle of any  allocation of shares in the control must be  to provide separate represents-         tionof opposed aspects and policies, to secure adequate and  impartial  consideration,  while at the         same time securing common treatment of those aspects and policies which are at one.    (c) On  the analogy of railways, shipping,  canals, tramways, etc.,  the Board of  Trade, in its capacity as         a Ministry of Communications, would be the fitting department of the Government  to be concerned         with the commercial and civil aspects  of aeronautics.   On the contrary analogy of  the decision of        the Main  Committee,  shipping should be brought under the control of the Admiralty,  and railways,         roads, and canals under the control of the War Office  in times of peace.   Such a  step could not, I         think, be  contemplated.             The recent reorganisation of the Board of Trade  into  a  Ministry of Commerce  and  a Ministry        of Public  Utilities might  be carried a  stage further,  and  transport  utilities  placed  together  as  a         definite integral group of  the whole,  forming a Ministry of Communications, and leaving gas, water,         electricity, and other supply services only to be comprised among public utilities.    (d) The need  for a unified and single control of those matters which are similar in character and purpose         applies with equal force here.  There are many common  considerations relating  to the regulation        and control of traffic quite apart from the particular means by  which the  traffic  is carried.  The         Board of  Trade has in the course of time built up an organisation  and practice  for  dealing  with        these questions which a slight development would  extend  to cover  aerial transport.  Especial refer-         ence may  be  made to such  questions as rates and charges, preferences, classification of commodities-        ties, efficiency of and  necessity for service, accidents and accident prevention, trade agreements, etc.,        all  of which have a commercial bearing rather than a  merely  technical bearing.    (e) The Air Ministry would continue to be responsible for  all  those aspects of aeronautics, other  than         commercial-, being extended and  developed to the best advantage  and generally for all technical         aspects.   Its particular responsibilities would, I think, be  properly  extended from  purely  warlike        responsibilities to cover :-        1.   The establishment, maintenance and operation  of  all aircraft belonging to the State or  used for             State purposes irrespective of the particular uses to which they are put or the  particular  Govern-             ment Departments for which they are worked (c.r/., Post Office);        2.  The establishment, maintenance and operation of all aerodromes and landing grounds belonging to             the State (I  would emphasise that  the State ownership of  aerodromes and landing  grounds             should be extended liberally beyond bare warlike or strategic requirements);         3.  The establishment, maintenance and operation  of all auxiliary  services essential to aeronautics             such as weather observation and reporting (in conjunction  with the Meteorological  Office), wire-             less telegraphy, signalling, distinguishing  of routes, etc., because such services must he commonwealth&amp;tt&apos;             to all users  of aircraft and can only be  effective on a national scale;         4. The ultimate control and responsibility for the  central research and experimental  station.   (It is             suggested that, apart from private effort, the Government should establish a central research and             experimental  station on a large scale and fully equipped to meet all the needs of the industry and             the State under a representative  constitution.)
184      (f) In addition  to the purely commercial questions the  Board of Trade  would appear  to be  the  proper          Ministry to be responsible for          1.  The licensing of aircraft and pilots;          2.  The investigation of accidents relating to aircraft employed for civil use;          9,  The establishment of rules and regulations for aerial  traffic,  including  safety  requirements for              passenger services;          I.  The licensing and inspection of aerodromes and landing grounds not belonging to the State.          The  Air  Ministry  would adopt the rides  and regulations of the  Board of Trade in connection  with          State-owned aircraft and aerodromes.  The rules  and regulations for aerial navigation  and conduct          generally would be a joint undertaking.  The technical inspecting officers of the Board of Trade would          be  presumably seconded from the Air Ministry.   A  close relationship (if the two would necesarily          exist.     (g) Finally, the administration of the  law and the prosecution of offences against the rules and regula-          tions for aerial navigation  or aerial traffic would  be carried out by or under the supervision of the          Board of Trade.  It is essential, I think, that there should be a clear distinction  drawn between  civil          and military administration, particularly in relation  to the enforcement of law and order.  It would          be  an  eminent departure from constitutional practice! to set  up a  Government Department chiefly of         an executive character and primarily  to carry out the work of operating aircraft for the  State, and          then permit it to undertake the administration of the law which it  may itself fail to observe or to          undertake duties of an administrative character on  behalf of privately-owned aircraft in which State          and private  interest might  very well be in conflict.     With this explanation, therefore, I dissent from the recommendation of the Main Committee that the Air Ministry should have its scope and powers extended to cover  civil aerial transport.     5.  I submitted to the members  of Special Committee  No. 3 a memorandum setting out a connected series of views on the question of the demand for  and supply of aircraft after the war which failed to secure adoption. Without traversing that memorandum which  is on record. I think that the report of that Committee and the report of the Main Committee on the subject  fail to distinguish sufficiently between the actual output of air- craft bv factories and factory  capacity for aircraft nroduction.     My understanding of the situation is that aircraft of types suitable for civil use will not comply  sufficiently closely with the requirements of aircraft of types for warlike purposes to make them effectively  interchange- able, and that  aircraft of civil types  will only serve for  purposes  auxiliary to military  employment proper. That being so, a capacity to rapidly increase the output of machines of military&apos; type is the desideratum. rather than the continuous  upkeep of large fleets  of only partially serviceable aircraft.     It  is agreed that there must lie an establishment of aircraft kept up wholly  for military purposes  and fixed at such strength as the Government from time to time deems  essential to the national safety.  Beyond that the most material object  to lie assured is a capacity to produce swiftly a sufficiency of aircraft to meet the extravagant demands of war.     Experience in the present war has shown that  many factories and industrial plants ordinarily  engaged upon work of a useful and wealth-producing character can  be adanted  to the production of aircraft or parts of aircraft when occasion compels.   It is, therefore, strongly  urged that a proper scheme should be worked out for the co-ordination of such factories and industrial plants as are suitable to an enlarged production before- hand, so  that the change-over on &quot;the outbreak of war may for the future be  instantly effective.   For  this purpose it may be  that modifications should be introduced  in the lay-out and tool equipment which while not seriously prejudicial to the tasks of peace,  would enhance efficiency  for the tasks of war.   Reserves of tools, patterns, jigs, drawings, etc., should be held in readiness against the day of change, and should be  constantly overhauled and kent up to date.     To the extent to which  auxiliary  factories  and industrial plants  can in this way be brought  into account to bridge the enormous gap between the normal peace and war requirements of aircraft so the problem of the aircraft industry after the  war becomes more manageable.     6.  In addition to the omission indicated in the preceding paragraph, I  regret that  the Report of the Main Committee omits any reference to the  economic limit which must be placed upon the expansion of aeronautics, seeing that there is little prospect of the immediate commercial return from  the  operation of aircraft being sufficient to support an adequate programme.  The burden of armaments has been  heavy in  the past, but the trend of this Avar has been to build up a material equipment of artillery, tanks and other  devices for warfare on land which must afterwards remain a costly addition to the  establishment.   Unless, therefore, some steps can be taken to limit armaments as the outcome of this  war,  the burden looks like being greater  than can be borne with an army on  a Continental scale,  a preponderating naval and aerial fleet on top  of  the debt charges consequent on the war  itself.  Here, again, until the  conclusion of  this Avar can be  reasonably foreseen,  it is hard to pronounce for any definite policy, but a hopefulness of outlook is not  to be put aside as unjustified. There are limiting conditions to the aircraft industry which deserve  notice in a report of this kind.    7. Nothing that  I  have said will, I trust, be taken  to detract  from  my concurrence  with  the  vital necessity  of taking all measures which  may be necessary for the safety and  security of our  Empire in whatever situation may arise on the close of this war.Sqpr So  many points are dealt with directly  or by implication in the Report of the Main Committee with which I am in accord that I have signed that  Report, but my signature must be qualified by the  observations set out in this memorandum.

Report  of  Special Committee No.  1.Terms of Reference :      To advise as to policy and necessary legislation, with special reference to-        (1) The attitude to be adopted by the State with regard to national sovereignty in the air and  inter-            national  questions connected with aerial transport.        (2) The question of State  ownership (if  any)  or of necessary State control and  regulations as to            Customs, Quarantine, and Aliens.        (3) Necessary amendments of the common and  statute  law as to  the air space covering private            property and as to compulsory purchase of  land for aerodromes and landing  grounds.        (4) The principles of liability for damage caused by or  to aircraft.                                              PART I.              National  Sovereignty  in  the  Air and  International  Questions.    1, In considering this branch of the enquiry referred to them by the Main Committee the  Special Com-mittee have found it necessary to view the subject from two aspects.  The first of these relates to the general attitude which it is  thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt at any future International Confer-ence with regard to  aeronautics and the second to the more detailed terms of  any  Convention that H.M.G. maysee fit to agree to as one of many contracting Powers. The Committee. recognise the fact that  it would  notbe within  the  province of the Main Committee in  any sense to prescribe to H.M.G. a complete policy govern-ing their action at any future International Conference.  This  policy is clearly dependent  partly upon factors which do not fall within the terms of reference to the Main Committee, as, for  instance, the relative strengthof the European Powers at the end of the War and the development of aircraft for attack and defence on land and sea.   In presenting  their recommendations  the Committee desire it to be  understood that these shouldbe regarded only from the point of view of the effect of international  policy upon the use of  aircraft for civil and commercial purposes.    2. Throughout  their consideration of this  branch of their enquiry the Committee received great assistancefrom  a set of Foreign Office papers selected and prepared for their  use  by  Lord Drogheda,  which contain  ahistory of international negotiations  on aeronautical matters from 1910 to 1913. A reference to these paperswill show  that as a  preliminary to agreeing  to the terms  of any  Convention,  the nature  of the claim of  a sovereign State to the absolute and undisputed control of the air space above  its  territories and the waterssurrounding its coasts  should  be carefully considered, and, moreover, should be made  the subject  of someclear  definition.    3. The Committee do not think that, from the point of view  of civil and commercial aeronautics it wouldbe of much advantage to include  in  this report anything  in the nature of  a  study or  history of the much-disputed question of sovereignty in the air  space.   They have  had the  opportunity of considering  variouspapers in  which the  right of the State  to  sovereignty in the air space over  its territories, as opposed to the doctrine of the  &quot; freedom of the air &quot; is discussed.   They  would, however,  draw special  attention to an opinion of  the Law Officers  given in 1911 in answer to  certain questions submitted to them by the  ForeignOffice. It should be noted that these questions related solely to the claims which  the State should assert asagainst other States.  These questions and the  Opinion are here set out :-   Law Officers of  the Grown to Sir Echoard Grey.                (Received June  15.)                                                                           Royal Courts of Justice,                                                                              2nd June, 1911.    Sir-        We were  honoured with  your commands  signified in  Mr. L.  Mallefs letter of the 16th February    last, transmitting to us  the accompanying papers respecting the International Conference on Aerial.Navi-    gation, and requesting us lo  favour you with our opinion  :-            1. Whether it  was possible to claim for the State  (1) as matter  of public law, and (2) as matter        of English municipal law  (or &quot; droit interne&quot;)  the right  of &quot;property&quot; over the air superincum-        bent upon  its territories ?            2. Whether, in any  event, the term &quot; sovereignty &quot; used  in this  connection  would not confer        on the  State that absolute control over vessels  navigating  the air  above  its  territories which  His        Majesty&apos;s Government consider to  be indispensable?            3. As  to what term, or terms, it would on  the whole be  most  desirable  and  advantageous to        employ in  order to secure such absolute and undisputed control?            4. Generally.&apos;        We have taken  the papers into  our consideration, and in  obedience to your commands, have the    honour to                                              REPORT.        In our  opinion, the term &quot; full and absolute sovereignty &quot; would be the  most desirable and advan-    tageous term to employ in order to  secure  for the  State absolute  and undisputed control over vessels    navigating the air above its territories.   We  prefer this phrase to the use of the word &quot; property &quot; when    considering  the rights of the State as  a matter of  international  law; though the result  is really  the    same, whichever  expression is used.
185         As a matter of English municipal law the principle applies cujus est solum ejus est usque ad voelum,     so that theoretically, the  rights of  the  private owner are as great  in respect of the air-space above his     land as over the surface of the land  itself.         As regards the air space  soviet upon territorial waters, it is to be observed that the degree     of control necessary  to secure  the safety of the State may well be greater than that required in reference     to the use  of territorial waters themselves.  And since the principle of  State  sovereignty involves  the     right  of the State in relation  to its own territories to  exercise such powers as are  necessary  for  the     defence and security of its dominions, we  think that jurisdiction over  the air immediately  surrounding     the coasts,  and for such a distance  outwards as is necessary for the defence and security of the State,     ought to  be not less  than that exercisable over the air-space which is  actually above the territory of the     State.                                                                   We have, etc.                                                                                    Rufus D. Isaacs.                                                                                    John  Simon.     2. It  seems that throughout the period of  the International Conference in Paris in  1910 and up to the outbreak of the war H.M.G. had  always  maintained the  position  that every State should  claim full  and absolute sovereignty in the air above its territories and territorial waters, and that this claim was disputed by certain of the other negotiating Powers, notably Germany.  Since the outbreak of war  the principle of State sovereignty over the air  has been  generally claimed, and,  except  by Germany, recognised;  Holland, Den- mark,  and Switzerland have  consistently regarded the passage of belligerent aircraft over their territory as an nnneutral  act, and  taken active steps  to vindicate their rights.     On the general attitude which H.M.G. should adopt at  any  International Conference,  the  Committee support the principle which is referred  to in the Foreign Office Memorandum of July 29th, 1910, despatched on that date to H.M. representatives at all  the European capitals, viz,  :--       that no regulations should be framed  which in any  way exclude or  limit the right, of any State to         prescribe the conditions under  which the air above  its territory should be navigated.&quot;     The Committee also  think that the claim of the State may well be framed in  the manner set out in the Law Officers&apos; Opinion of 1911 (see paragraph 3), but they recognise that an assertion of absolute sovereignty in the air space may, from a juristic point of  view, be  liable to objection.   The  issue  on  this  particular question is one more of words than of  substance, it being  desirable, in whatever  form  the  claim is made, that the State should be  understood to  claim full control and  jurisdiction  in the air space above its.territory up to  any height at which  aircraft can  now or  in the future be  capable of use.  Subject to this explanation, the Committee recommend that the assertion  of sovereignty or the claim  to complete  control and  jurisdic- tion, whichever phrase may  be used, should,  from the point of view of civil or commercial aeronautics, form the basis of the policy of H.M.G.  at any  future International Conference,     6. It  will  be  observed  that the recommendations in the preceding paragraph do not touch upon the vexed question of territorial waters.  The Committee have come to the  conclusion, that the claim of the State, as expressed in that paragraph, should apply also in respect of  the  air space  above territorial waters, but in view of the present uncertainty in the determination of the limits of such waters, the Committee also recom- mend that the claim in this respect should  be  made applicable  to any waters now or hereafter to be claimed as territorial waters.     7. With regard to the  detailed terms  of any future International Convention relating to aeronautics, the Committee derived great assistance from a &quot;Report of  a  Sub-Committee   of  the  Committee of Imperial Defence, dated 17th July, 191.3.  In this Report were reviewed the terms of the Draft Convention prepared in Paris  at the International Conference held from May 18th to July 29th, 1910.  This Conference was  not  able to complete a draft convention for ratification by the contracting Powers, owing mainly to a conflict of opinion between the British and German delegates  as  to the right of each State to  the sovereignty of the air over its territories. The contention of the British delegates has already been referred to in paragraph 4 of the present report.  The  Draft Convention, as it stood when the International Conference  finally  adjourned  represents the limits within which the conferring Powers  were able to agree at the time of adjournment.     8. In the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee  of Imperial  Defence the Draft Convention is set out, and in a parallel column are placed the amendments  and  modifications suggested by that Sub-Com- mittee. The Committee have thought that the most convenient method&apos; of dealing with international problems of civil and commercial aeronautics was to consider the  articles of  the Draft Convention seriatim  together with the amendments  and modifications proposed by the   Sub-Committee  of the  Committee  of Imperial Defence.  A translation of the text of the  Convention prepared in  the  Foreign  Office  by Lord  Drogheda, together with the observations of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of this Com- mittee thereon is set out as Appendix A  to the present report.  With regard to the three annexes to the Con- vention which  frame rules respectively as to  nationality and registration  marks, characteristics of  aircraft, and Rules relating to aerial navigation, the Committee, in  view of  the  technical  details.involved  and  the recent development of aircraft from the scientific point of  view, have  thought it advisable to  refer these to Special Committee No. 2 for investigation  and report.     9. At the end of the Draft Convention of  1910 will be found four recommendations which do  not form a part of the text of the Draft  Convention  itself.  Of these  recommendations, the subject matter of  the  first two appear to the Committee to relate  to  matters which fall  within the scope  of Special Committee No. 2. With  regard to No. 3, the Committee have made a recommendation. With regard to No. 4, the CommitteeS^lderstand that the Conference of 1910  contemplated an International Board for Aerial Navigation which should act as a permanent link between  the various Governments, and should collect information with a  view to the revision of the rules of the  road and for questions of  international  importance,  but  that  the British Delegation did not consider that  the time was ripe for a permanent institution of this kind.    In present circumstances it is  evident that the possibility of establishing such an  International  Board  is  considerably more  remote than it was  in  1910, and the Committee do not feel that  they can usefully make  any definite recommendation  on the subject.
     10. Two points have,arisen for consideration which  do  not touch  upon the,  text  of  the Convention itself:       (i.) It appears to the Committee that questions of damage caused by foreign aircraft visiting this country         will have to be borne in  mind  in  connection  with  any future Convention.   For  the purpose  of         ensuring reparation  for such  damage  it might he possible  to  require all  foreign aircraft to insure         against risks of damage to third parties as  a condition ol&apos;  their  registration or licence, as the case         may be.  The Committee think that this point should be considered by H.M.G., particularly in view         of the possibility of  some mutual system of national  insurance being ultimately arranged.     (ii.) As a matter of policy it will be for H.M.G. to decide which are the Powers with whom they would         wish to enter into an international agreement of the nature contemplated in  the draft convention.         It would  appear  probable that in  any event H.M.G. would wish  to  enter into such  an agreement         with France and Italy.   The Committee, therefore, suggest that the recommendations contained in         this report should be communicated to the  French and Italian  Governments,  with  an invitation to         those Governments to express their views on the recommendations.   The French Government might         also be consulted  as  to the advisability of inviting a similar expression of views  from  the Government         of the United States.

The control of aerial navigation after the war in the  United  Kingdom  and the  Empire is  a matter which  will  necessitate some legislation.  Before the  war the control  of aerial navigation in the United King-dom was dealt with by two Acts of Parliament, the  Aerial Navigation Act.  1911  (1 and 2 Geo. 5,  C.4.) andthe Aerial Navigation Act, 1913 (2  and 3 Geo. 0, C.22.).    Under the  first  of these two Acts  power  wasconferred upon the Home Secretary to prohibit the navigation of aircraft over prescribed areas,  and  an Order Iby the  Home Secretary under that Act, dated 22nd  September.  1913 (S.R. and  0.,  1913,  No. 1090)  pro-1hibited  the  navigation of aeroplanes over so much of the County of London  as lay within a circle, the centre of which was Charing Cross and radius of which was  four miles in length.   The  Act of  1913  extended  the power  of the Home Secretary to regulate  aircraft and provided for compulsory landing of  aircraft  coming from any place outside the United  Kingdom.  Orders and Regulations made  by  the Home  Secretary dated 1st March,  1913  (S.R. and O.. 1913, Nos. 228 and 243)  made  provision for (a)  prohibited  areas; (b) portions of the coast line  prohibited to aircraft from  abroad; (c)  landing areas for aircraft  from  abroad; and (d)  con-ditions  imposed on aircraft from abroad.  On August 2nd, 1.914  (S.R.  and  O..  1914,  No.  1117),  an order was made by the Home  Secretary prohibiting navigation of all, except Naval and Military, aircraft over  thewhole area of the United Kingdom.  These Acts, Orders, and Regulations represent  the only legislative enaet-ments made before the war.  Some similar legislation had been passed in other portions of the  British Empire.     2.   In anticipation of the  early development of aeronautics, the Home Office, in 1911, prepared  an AerialNavigation Bill *1 which represents what in that  year  would have been  the basis of a complete code of lawjcontrolling  aerial navigation.  This Bill, a print of which  is appended to  this report  as Appendix  B, has]been of the  greatest assistance to the Special Committee  in this branch of their enquiry, and though lateraeronautical developments render modification of some  of  its  provisions necessary, the Special  Committee!approve of the general lines on which the Bill is drawn.     3.   It has appeared to the Committee convenient to deal  in  the body of  this  report with the general 1principles on which  Government control and legislation should be based and to relegate to a third  Appendix!(Appendix  C) their recommendations as to matters of  detail and their suggestions as to such drafting moditi-pcations  of the Bill as they think may be of assistance to the Parliamentary draftsman.     4.  In the Preamble to the Bill will be  found an assertion of sovereignty and rightful jurisdiction of the!Crown over the air soviet on all parts of H.M.  Dominions  and  the territorial waters   adjacent Ithereto.  With regard to this assertion, the Special  Committee would refer  to Part I.  of their report, para-j.^graphs  2 6 inclusive, in which the international  aspects of the assertion are dealt with.  Such an assertion Ifis  presupposed in any municipal legislation,  and  the Committee think it necessary to emphasise their recom-jjmendation  that the assertion should be made complete and comprehensive.  In the opinion of the Committee[Ithe hitherto ^recognised  &quot;  three-mile limit &quot; of  territorial  waters is not sufficient, having regard to the  newproblems of aerial navigation.    5.  It will be observed that the Bill contemplates the following Government Departments as  taking  partin control  and regulation :-the  Home Office, the Board  of Trade, Customs, and Post  Office.  Of  these thetwo  last named are only concerned with particular provisions relating to  Customs and mails.   The  Bill  pro-poses that the Home Office should act in imposing and enforcing general regulations, while to  the  Board ofTrade are assigned duties as to registration, certificates of  different kinds, and regulations regarding collisions,salvage, and matters ejusdem  yeneris,  In so far as the powers of the Board of Trade are concerned the Billis drawn largely  upon the  analogy of the  Merchant Shipping Acts.  The  creation  of a new Air Ministry will afford a convenient opportunity for conferring on that Ministry the  powers  of the Home Office and Board ofTrade to regulate aerial navigation.  The advantages  of assigning to a single  Department of State the regulation of  all  matters relating to civil aerial transport  are  manifest, and the relevant clauses of  the Bill willrequire  amendment accordingly.    6.  The Committee propose next to deal with the  questions of principle arising on the different clauses of the Bill.CLAUSE  1.                                                                                            X)    In  connection with sub-section  (1) (b)  of this Clause and any regulations which may be made thereunder,attention is  called to the Committee&apos;s  recommendations in Part I. of this report relating to Article 19 of theDraft International Convention, and  particularly to the additional rule which the Committee suggest shouldbe inserted in that  Article.  It appears to the Committee that some  caution  should be  observed in the pre-      *  This  Bill was in  a preliminary stago of preparation and had not been ndopted by the Home Offico or tho Government.
186scription of areas for the landing of foreign aircraft, so that,  while  every reasonable encouragement shouldbe given to the visits of foreign aircraft, reciprocal facilities should be secured for our  own aircraft landing&quot;abroad.  It has to  be borne in mind  that as the geographical area of the British Isles is comparatively small,it is to the advantage of this country, from the purely commercial point of view to secure free access for heraircraft to  foreign territory.  From this point of view, therefore, a  liberal  policy in  the matter  of inter-national  aerial  navigation for civil  purposes  is  indicated.  Certain verbal amendments to this  Clause are sug-gested in Appendix  C.CLAUSE 2.    The Committee appreciate  the fact that the broad questions of  nationality  and naturalisation are being dealt  with  independently of aerial navigation.  As a matter of principle arising on  (d) they think that in thecase of companies the true criterion should  be that the effective control of the  company for  all purposes should be vested in British subjects.   They refer to their  recommendation on Article 3 of the  Draft Convcn-tion as equally applicable to the  sub-section in question.    With regard to the ownership of aircraft by subjects of British Protectorates, the Committee adopt thesuggestion  of the legal  advisers of  the Colonial Office that a clause should be added  to  the Bill  empoweringHis Majesty, by Order in Council, under  the Foreign Jurisdiction Act  to apply the provisions of the Bill,with any necessary  adaptations, to Protectorates  and Protected States.   The  India  Office should  be  consulted as to  whether the proposed new clause would be applicable to India as it stands or whether it would require modification to  apply it  to the Native  States.CLAUSE 3.    The Committee think that, following the precedent of the Merchant Shipping Act,  1894, the Bill shouldexpressly provide for local registration in the  various British Possessions.CLAUSE 4.    The Committee  feel that  the question of certificates of airworthiness is one which requires close atten-tion.   Regulations  as to certificates, of navigability and reciprocal recognition  by the contracting  Powers ofsuch  certificates were contemplated in the  Draft Convention of 1910.  It appears  to the Committee that forthe purpose of  ensuring safety for  the ordinary population it is better to  provide for the competency of pilotsby  stringent regulations rather  than  to  run the risk of hampering the development of civil  aeronautics  by imposing on all aircraft onerous conditions as to tests and examination, which might possibly be imposedwithin the terms of the Clause.  At the same time the Committee  think  it  reasonable to  require  thatpassenger machines plying for hire  must  be  of types the airworthiness of which has been officially certified.The Committee therefore recommend that  the provisions of Clause 4 should only be  made applicable to types of passenger machines  [dying  for hire,  and that this should be made clear in the  Clause itself,  and not leftto exemption under the regulations.  Even in  the case  of  types of  aircraft requiring  certificates  of  air-worthiness the  Committee feel that  the regulations should be so drawn  as not to  hinder the development of design in the early days of civil aerial transport. The Committee think  that  these  conclusion should  beborne in mind in the settlement of any future  Convention.CLAUSE 5.    The Committee approve this Chaise.CLAUSE 6.    The Committee, while recognising the  necessity for collision regulations, are not in a position to make recommendations as to  the details  of such regulations, which  fall within the province of  Special CommitteeNo. 2.  In so far as the clause&apos; proposes alternative sub-sections, the Committee approve the second alterna-tive sub-section (3).  As  to the alternative sub-sections numbered (4) the Committee are of  opinion that itis  advisable to  retain the principles governing both the alternatives.   As to  sub-section  (5), subject to adrafting amendment noted in  Appendix C, the Committee approve this provision, omitting therefrom thepower of seizure and detention as being unnecessary.  They consider  that infringements of the regulationsare sufficiently  dealt with under the other parts of the Clause.CLAUSE T.    The Committee  approve this clause subject  to some drafting amendments  suggested in  Appendix C.CLAUSE 8.    The Committee approve this Clause,  but they express the  view that private aircraft flying  in  their own country and not for hire should be expressly exempted from the obligation of carrying logs.CLAUSE 9.    Subject to  the  details of these regulations being considered by Special Committee No. 2,  the Committeeapprove this Clause.CLAUSE 10.    The Committee approve this Clause subject to the exceptions already suggested  by  them  in their reeom-mendation to Article 33 of the Draft Convention.  (See Appendix A.)
E.L!    The Committee recommend the substitution of an alternative clause proposed by the Secretary to the1Post Office,  which is set out in Appendix C.                                                               CiaClause 12.    This Clause  is very  important to  private landowners.   It proposes to  deprive  the  landowner  of hisfflpfrequently asserted right,  to  the air space  over his land usque  ad coelum.    To retain  this  doctrine in mm^entirety would be fatal to civil  aeronautics.   On the other hand,  to  allow  unrestricted flying over private property at all altitudes would interfere with  the reasonable rights of  landowners.   The  interference wouldtake the form either of trespass or of nuisance.    The Committee think that  the following recommendations would, on  the  one  hand,  give reasonableprotection or compensation to landowners  and, on the other, impose on  aviators no obligation  which couldnot be covered  by insurance  at reasonable  rates,  and so avoid hampering the development of civil aeronautics.    The Committee therefore recommend  that the Bill should provide as follows :-    (a) No action for trespass should lie except  for material damage to person or  property, whether caused         by flight ascent or landing or the fall of objects from aircraft.    (b) That this right of action for trespass  should include one for injury caused by  the assembly of persons        on  the landing or ascent of aircraft elsewhere than at authorised aerodromes or landing places.    (c) That the obligation on the aviator  in  an action for trespass should be absolute, negligence not being        a necessary element in  his liability and  &quot; unavoidable accident &quot; no defence.    (d) That an action for nuisance should lie for damages only, and then only if breach of flying regula-  lar        tions is proved as well as actual nuisance.                                                         to    (e) That special flying regulations should be made  in connection with  the  ascent  and  landing  from  ,\V(        or at authorised aerodromes and landing places, and for the area around the aerodrome or landing  rep        place  over which aircraft must necessarily be at low altitudes.  Nuisance and injury  to the valueH         of property caused  by  the existence of aerodromes and landing places  are met by paragraph  10 of             this report.                                                                                      6jn    (f) That the power of seizure and detention  proposed in Clause 12 should be limited to what is necessary  for         to establish the identity of the aviator and his aircraft.                                            .t[1(    Reasonable apprehensions may  be entertained of nuisance being caused by the frequent flight of aircraft  6uat low altitudes along regular routes, but the Committee are not at present in a position to make  any recommended-mendation as to limitations of altitude being prescribed by regulation.Clause 13.    The Committee think that it is inadvisable to name in the  Clause a fixed percentage for salvage reward.!but that the amount to be paid should be left to the discretion of the appropriate tribunal.Clause 14,    The Committee approve this Clause.Clause 15.    The Committee understand  that this Clause contemplates regulations which will minimise damage to air-craft while under detention.  As  to the nature of such regulations the Committee have obtained  advice  fromSpecial Committee  No\  2.   It appears that the main causes of damage to  aircraft under such conditions willbe (i.) weather, (ii.) interference by spectators.  Without making suggestions in detail the Committee thinkthat the regulations should provide  that the person detaining  the  aircraft should  agree  to  any reasonableproposal put forward  by the pilot for the avoidance of damage, e.g., mooring the machine head to wind, withthe assistance of earth-screws or stakes, if such are available,  and  arranging for  a guard  or other suitablemeans of preventing  damage by spectators.  It seems that the mooring of the aeroplane is more important than its  protection  from the rain, in cases where the aircraft is only to be detained for some hours.Clause 16.    Subject to a note in Appendix  C the Committee approve this Clause.Clauses 17 and  18.    Subject to a drafting amendment in Clause  18, the Committee approve these Clauses.Clause 19.    The Committee think  that the  language of Section 2 of the Aerial Navigation  Act, 1913 (which  closelycorresponds with this clause) should be substituted.  Recent  experience has shown  the  danger of foreignaircraft flying over prohibited areas of strategic importance.   The Committee think that the regulations con-templated and,  indeed,  the Clause  itself should be made more drastic,  and that anyone flying over an areaprohibited for naval or  military reasons should be liable to be fired at by  a Commissioned Officer in chargeof an anti-aircraft  gun,  in  his discretion,  even without a preliminary signal, in a case of urgency.Clause 20.    The Committee think that this Clause contains useful provisions which might well be extended to  all british  Possessions, subject to the  right of  the legislature of any such Possessions to alter them.Clauses 21 and 22.                                                                                    -    The Committee approve these Clauses.Clause 23.,    The Committee think that Clause 23 would be clearer if  re-cast, and  that it should provide  that the Actand regulations should apply, mutatis mutandis, throughout all British Possessions, unless  and until the legis-lature of any British  Possession otherwise provides, subject to the  exception that local legislatures should notthiTldainthnaAcbyfa]
187 ms  tovatsisedonsinglla-ominglue ofiryaftould   7- It  will be observed that the  Bill contains no provisions dealing with  aerodromes or landing  places.   lie Committee  have considered the question whether all aerodromes (including Flying Schools) and landing   (ices should be State owned.  They have come to the conclusion that this is not desirable, but that, whileabl(.ttvate persons and companies  should be allowed to establish and own aerodromes and landing places, theseJuld ould be  subject to  Government licence, inspection, and regulation in some form.  It seems to the CommitteeicH- at reasonable regulations will go a  long way towards preventing  injury and annoyance to the public, and    ill at the same time  protect aircraft owners from frivolous claims and proceedings.  As experience accumu-    tes the regulations will,  no doubt, require modification and different regulations will be appropriate accord-    g as the aerodromes and landing places are in  populous or sparsely-populated  districts. In licensing aero-    omes the State will, no doubt, have regard to strategic considerations,  and provision should be made that    hen war  is imminent any privately owned aerodromes that may have been  allowed to be  established, with  . eir equipment, should at once be available for military use.      The Committee  have already touched upon the  necessity  of some flying &quot;regulations applicable particu-    rly to aerodromes.   With regard to this and any other regulations for preventing injury  and annoyance     the  public, they do not offer  detailed  suggestions, but they think that  Section 126 of the Factory and    orkshop  Act, 1901  (Special Orders) furnishes a satisfactory precedent for the scope of the powers to make    regulation* to be conferred on the appropriate Government Department.      8.  The consideration of aerodromes and  landing places involves the question of the compulsory acquisition     land for their  establishment.  The Committee are of  opinion  that  the  Government  should  be  given   milar rights of compulsorily acquiring land for  aerodromes and landing  places as it has for acquiring land   ir military works.   Private  persons wishing to obtain powers for the compulsory  acquisition  of  land  for   te establishment of aerodromes must proceed by way of private  Act of Parliament or provisional order.   uch powers would, presumably, have to include powers to cut  down trees,  remove wire, or perform otherm-1 milar acts on adjoining land not acquired.      9. It is scarcely within the  province of the Committee to recommend  alterations in procedure relating  fthe compulsory acquisition  of land. At the same time they think that  it would be  of great  assistance  to    e development of aeronautics generally if the determination  of  the amount of compensation payable  to    e landowner could  be made the subject of  a more simple and less expensive procedure than that at present    iployed in private bill legislation.   The Light Railways Act of 1896 affords a useful precedent for the avoid-   nce of some of the difficulties,  With regard to the amount of compensation payable to the  landowners the   rinciples  of the Land Clauses  Acts  have been construed to the landowner&apos;s advantage through the estab-   establishment by recent judicial decisions  of the doctrine  known  as  &quot; special  adaptability,&quot;  whereby the  land-   wner can, in fact, obtain  a  sum representing a  value greater than the ordinary market value of his land   here he can show that the land  is specially adapted for the  purpose for which it is being compulsorily taken.   his judicial doctrine has in  some instances increased the amount  payable to landowners, and it is one which   le landowner might pray in aid successfully  in the case of the  compulsory acquisition of land  for an aero-  rome.   The  Committee think  that  the application  of this doctrine should be specifically excluded.      10. The Committee have also considered  the subsidiary question of claims for compensation by persons,  le value of whose property, has been impaired by reason of the establishment of an aerodrome in the vicinity.   hey think that claims for such compensation should be entertained at any time within five years from the  ate of the establishment of the aerodrome, and that such compensation should be payable from State funds  n the case of an aerodrome established by the Government and by the proprietor in the case of a privately  wned aerodrome.     11. The Committee think that the matters referred to in paragraphs 7 to 10 inclusive,  above, should be  he subject of legislation, and that as they are all  matters affecting the development and regulation of aero-  lautics from the general point  of view,  they can  well  be dealt with by the addition of further clauses to the  lerial Navigation Bill under consideration.     In conclusion,  the  Special Committee wish to record their warm appreciation of the assistance rendered  y  the Secretaries, upon whom  has fallen much work, which has been so  ably  carried out as greatly to  acilitate their proceedings.

It appears to  the Committee that certain provisions in the Bill, at lease those contained in Clause 12, should .  ply to aircraft belonging to His Majesty.  They, therefore, recommend that this clause should be so draftedbjf to make the Bill applicable to aircraft belonging to His  Majesty,  except in  so far as any  part thereof,      than Clause 12, may be  excluded  by Order in  Council.
    1 concur m the Report with the following reservations, which are only made with the object of avoidinirestrictions  which may hamper  development of  a  new  mode of transport, of which very little is knownilthe present time, whereas, as experience accumulates,  it will lie easy to make such regulations as maylinecessary :-Part I., paragraph 1.                                                                                J    Whilst, it is necessary to confer upon the Home Secretary or other authority the right  to  prohibit tilnavigation of aircraft over prescribed areas, I should favour tin.&apos; expression of an opinion from this Committflthat the prohibition cf flying over London should be repealed, also the regulations as to aircraft coming intlEngland.   Many of the regulations made were made naturally for war purposes.  Compulsory landing of ailcraft in England, for instance, must affect British  aircraft more than any other, as it is probable that if cowlpulsory landing is insisted  upon in England, compulsory landing will be insisted upon  in other countrielIt will be easy to make such regulations when circumstances show that it is necessary.   The Committalmoreover,  suggest that the -powers at present wielded by the Home Office and  Board of Trade will  be cotlferred  upon the Air Ministry, in which  I quite concur,  but it  makes it  more  necessary to  leave the ncflauthority  a free  baud to  make such  regulations  as  circumstances may prove  necessary in  the future,     part II., paragraph 6, Clause 5.                                                                      j    1 see no reason at the present time for requiring any Government certificate for  private flyers,  nor IIrestricting the use of the  flying  machine in this respect  any more than a motor  car or boat, especially as tilpublic  is protected by the fact that the  flyer  himself is  always running a greater risk than anyone else. TlJconditions of the Aero Club certificate have in the past  been quite sufficient.                         ,&quot;   jParagraph 6,  Clause 12.                                                                              [    Ditto.  I am not in  agreement with the Committee that the Bill  should provide any regulations as Ithe altitude at which  pilots should fly.  I see no reason  to suppose  that in  the  immediate  future jiifllmachines will  be in use at aerodromes than were in use previous to the war,  and if  circumstances show tilla great many more machines are in  use, to the danger  or annoyance of the public,  such  regulations as Mlbe necessary may then be made.  To hamper at the present time a new development with regulations, wliicimight be quite unnecessary, would  probably restrict development.Paragraph 0. Clause 14.    1  am not  in agreement with giving the  Police such powers of search of aircraft and the persons therein.!although it might be well to give the Secretary of State power to make regulations on this point in the future 1should they be necessary.Paragraph 7.    I am not in agreement with any control whatever  over aerodromes  and landing places  at  the  present]time other than the powers which existed before the war, and which have proved quite satisfactory up totto!present time.   Any control must  tend to hamper the establishment of private grounds,and landing places,&apos;which is undesirable in the early stages of development.    The above reservations I have made solely with the object of permitting as  free as possible developingiof the use of aircraft.  I do not, however, foresee any  such  development in the immediate future  asWjnecessitate  regulations other than  those as existed before the war, and,  in  the absence  of more compelknowledge of  the subject, I would suggest that, wherever possible, conditions should be left as they are ant&quot;our experience of the subject has so accumulated that we have a definite  knowledge of what regulations affexpedient and desirable.

I desire to add a few words by way of reservation to Clause  6  of  Part  II. of this Report, so far asaffects &quot;Clause 12 of the Home  Office  Bill.    Our recommendations seem to leave it open to an  aviator to fly over private  property at any height!likes unless actual material damage is proved,  and  even if a nuisance is created the aviator is still free if Ikeeps within certain  regulations, the  terms of which  we have not considered.    In my view, though  the whole doctrine of the right  of the  landowner to property in the air to an  indeinite height must he curtailed, still, I  am clearly of the opinion, that the public will demand,  and rightly,limit above which (except under stress of weather) aviators must fly above  private  property, and that anpersistent flying under  this  height should be preventable by injunction.    The actual  height should, I think,  be the subject of consultation with  the  other sub-committees, lj,probably somewhere  between 2,000-3,000 feet would be fair.

ARTICLE 1.   THE term &quot; aircraft &quot; comprises:  Free  balloons, air- ships,  and flying  machines.                       ARTICLE 2.   An aircraft is only governed by the present Convention if it possesses  the nationality of  a  contracting  State.   None of the contracting States shall permit a free but loon or airship  to fly  over its territory unless  it complies  with the above condition, though special and temporary  authorisation- tion may be granted.                     ARTICLE 3.   In determining the nationality of aircraft, the  legislation of each contracting State shall base  its decision  either on. the nationality of their owner or on his domicile in its terri- tory; the State has, moreover, the right of requiring thai. the owner,  if a national, shall nlso be domiciled in its terri- tory, and it can place on  its national register aircraft owned by foreigners  domiciled  in  its territory as well as  those owned  by its own nationals.  If  tho aircraft belongs  to a  corporate society or joint-stock company it can only acquire the nationality of  the  State where  the  company&apos;s head office is situated.  In cases where the aircraft belongs to  several owners the proportion  of co-proprietors who arc nationals of  the state or aro domiciled in its territory must be at least two-thirds.

Sub - Committee&apos;s proviso approved.  The    Special   Committee understand   that   the   two criteria of  the nationality of aircraft, via., the  nationality of the  owner, and the owner&apos;s residence in the territory of a contracting   State,   are  not mutually  exclusive   altema- tivos.    Any provision  as to nationality   should  be  con- sidercd in  the light  of  exist- ing and future legislation re- latiug   to  naturalisation  of foreigners.  Any future legis- lation as to the nationality of aircraft should provide  that British  nationality should  be taken  to mean ownership  by British  subjects  or  by eor- porate  bodies  registered in the United  Kingdom  or  in some part of His Majesty&apos;s Domin-ions, the effective control ofwhich  for   all  purposes  is vested  in  British  subjects.                      ARTICLE 4.  When the aircraft possesses the nationality of one of tiiecontracting States in conformity with article 3, none of theother States can confer their nationality upon  it.

The contracting States will exchange annually in january the entries  which have been made in  their registers duringthe preceding year.  On  the request of another contracting State each State willbe obliged  to communicate as quickly as possible the names of the owner  and  pilot  of  any  aircraft  possessing  itsnationalitv  which has entered the air-space over  the  otherState.                       ARTICLE 10.  When flying over the territory of one of the contracting states, aircraft must bear  the mark of their nationality andtheir   registration  number,  in  the  manner  specified  in annex A.  They shall  also carry, affixed to the  car or  fuselage,  aplate  showing the name and  domicile  of the owner,  andreproducing the  nationality mark  and registration number which  they  bear.                        ARTICLE 11.  The  aircraft must be provided with  a  certificate of navig-ability issued or authenticated by the State whose nationalityit possesses.                       ARTICLE 12.   The certificate  of navigability  wilt only be issued after what are  considered to  be sufficient trials mado  before  a public  authority  of the contracting  State, or  an  aero. nautical association duly empowered by the State.  Never- theless, these preliminary trials  need not be required in the case of free  balloons, or of flying  machines of a type whose navigability  has already  been duly established.   Periodical  or non-periodical visits must be made by  the public authorities or by associations  duly empowered,  in order to verify the navigability of aircraft.    Such  visits shall  be noted on the certificate.                       ARTICLE 13.   The certificate of  navigability shall contain the following particulars:    Name or style  of firm  and domicile of  the maker; place  and year of manufacture;  number  or  other identification mark  given  to the  aircraft by  the  makers; photograph  in the  case  of dirigible  balloons and flying machines;  characteristics of the  aircraft in accordance with the provisions  of  Annex B.   If one of the characteristics specified  in the certificate of navigability  is modified  such certificate shall cease to be-valid.                       ARTICLE  14.   The pilot,  chief mechanic, and  their  substitutes  must be provided with  licences issued or  authenticated by the State whose nationality has been  conferred upon the aircraft  of which  they  are in  charge.   In urgent  eases the pilot can choose, to replace him or tocarry out  the  duties of chief mechanic, persons  provided with licences issued or made valid by  another contractingState.                       ARTICLE  15.   Different licences will be  issued  for the  control of a  freeballoon, an airship,  and  a  flying machine, and the licenceissued for  one category of  aircraft w$l not  empower the holder to take  charge of a different category.  These licences will only  be  issued  after the capacity ofthe pilots or  mechanics has been proved by theoretical and practical tests  carried out  before  a public authority of a contracting  State,  or  an  aeronautical  association  dulyempowered by the State.                       ARTICLE  16.  Licences  will only  be granted to  persons  at least  18 years old and of good character.

Certificates of navigability and licences issued or  authenticated-ticatcd by the State whose nationality an aircraft possessesshall be recognised as valid by the other States, unless it isclear that tho conditions under which they have been issued in accordance with the regulations  set forth above arc nolonger  fulfilled.  Each State has the right not to recognise, so far as flightswithin the limits  of, and above, its own territory are con-cerned, the certificate of navigability or licence granted toone of its nationals by  another contracting State.  Such non-recognition  shall immediately be notified to thoState which has  issued tho certificate  or licence.OHAPTBH III.-ADMISSION  OF AERIAL NAVIGATIONWITHIN THE LIMITS OF, OH ABOVE,  THE TERM-TORY OK A FOREIGN STATE.  Articles 19 and 20 were left undecided by the Paris Con-reference.  In  1913, the  Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence suggested tho  insertion  of the  followingArticles  in the Convention:-  1. Each  contracting  State  shall  permit  for  so long  asthe present Convention is in force the aircraft of the other states to fly  within the limits of and  above its territory,subject  to  the  restrictions  hud down in  the followingrules :-  2. Each State  shall have the right  to impose  restrictionson the navigation of foreign aircraft, and, more particularly,to forbid such  navigation so far as it deems necessary inorder to guarantee its own security  or that of the lives and property of its inhabitants.  These restrictions shall bo  applied without any inequalityto the aircraft of every other contracting  State.  It is, however,  agreed that on personal grounds, indepen-dent of  its nationality, a State can exempt an aircraft ofany other contracting State from any  one of the restrictions imposed in virtue of the first paragraph.  3. Moreover, each State can forbid or regulate the cross-ing  of  its frontiers,  provided that the principle laid downin  rule 1 is not violated,  and that in every case, exceptwhen aerial navigation is forbidden, the extent and localityof the places where the passage of the frontier is permittedare such  as to give access  to the neighbouring  contracting states.  4. In cases of accident verified by an  authority of  thecountry where an  aircraft  has been compelled to land,  theright of access, which under  the provisions of rule  2, para-graph I,  might be forbidden, cannot be refused.  The provisions of rule 2, paragraph 2, do  not apply tothe measures which, in extraordinary circumstances, a state may take to safeguard its security.  5. The  contracting States undertake, to adopt or to pro-pose to their legislatures  such measures  as may be requiredin order to make the private law of their country  conform to the above provisions.  The Sub-Committee intended that the following alternativerules should only be put forward  if  the  above rules did  notappear,  likely to provide a promising basis  for  negotiation with  the  French  Government:    1. The  aircraft  of  a  contracting State may only  fly overthe territories of the other contracting States provided theycomply  with, the regulations laid down by the latter.  2.  Such  regulations will  not  forbid tho  navigation offoreign aircraft, except when the  prohibition  appears, to thoState to be necessary in order to guarantee its own,, security or that of the lives and property of its inhabitants.  Rules 3, 4,  and o as above, with  the references  to para-graphs  corrected as necessary.      Observations andRecommendations of  SpecialCommittee No. 1 of tho civil aerial Transport  Committee.Acceptable.  The proposed rule suggestedby the C.I.D. Sub-committee approved.  The  rule  proposed by  the.1.D.  Sub-Committee limitsa contracting State&apos;s right of restricting navigation by  theaircraft  of  other contracting states,  and prohibits it fromdifferentiating as between  dif-ferent    foreign   contracting states.  This proposal is opento  the  objection that one con-tracting  State  might use its powers  of  restriction   moreseverely   than   others,    but nevertheless could not on  this account   be   differentiatedagainst by the others. To meet this objection   the  SpecialCommittee would propose  to insert  the following after  thesecond  sub-paragraph: -  &quot; It   is,   however, agreedthat  any  contracting  state may refuse  to accord to  anyother  contracting  State  any facilities which the latter doesnot  itself accord  under   itsregulations.&quot;  &quot;It  is  also agreed that on personal grounds,&quot; &amp;c,  &amp;c.  The  C.I.D. Sub-Committee&apos;recommendation agreed to, theSpecial   Committee   beingstrongly in favour of the omission-sion of anv  such rule.  The   proposed  rules   sug-gested  by the C.I.D. Sub-Com-mittee  approved.  The  alternative rules 1 and2  suggested  by  the  C.I.D.Sub-Committee approved  as abasis   for  negotiation  if  itshould be found that no inter-national agreement  was  ob-tainable on  the  basis  of  thepreceding draft rules 1-5.

Each contracting State shall have the right to reserve the public conveyance of persons  aud goods between two  points on  its territory  for nation  aircraft only  or  for  the  air- craft  of  certain contracting States, of  to  subject such navigation to special restrictions.  The establishment  of international routes of aerial com- immication  will  depend upon the assent of the States con- corned,                       ABTXOUI  22.  If a contracting State  imposes restrictions such,  as those contemplated in  article  18, paragraph 2, its  aircraft may bo subjected to analogous measures by any other contraet- ing State.                       AKXIOUI  23.  The restrictions and reservations contemplated in Articles 19,  20, 21, and 22 shall immediately  be published and noti- iied  to the Governments concerned.  The forbidden  zones  shall be  defined with sufficient prc- cision  to enable them to  be shown on aeronautical  maps of a scale of at least   jj^,jnu   &apos; The contracting States shall be obliged to communicate  these maps to one another.                       Aimcu;  24.  As soon as the pilot of  any aircraft perceives that he has entered the air space above a  forbidden  zone he must give the signal  of distress specified in Article 16 of  Annex  (0)and land as soon as possible; he must also land if requestedto do so by  warning given from the ground.   Each  State shall   give   notice  of  the  warning  signals which it  has adopted.CriAHTBK  IV.  -REG NATIONS  TO  BE OBSERVED  ON    DEPARTURE,   ON   LANDING,   AND   DURING    FLIGHT.

The provisions  of the present convention will  be appliedto public aircraft, with the  exception  of  those  of articles2 to 5, 11  to 18,  and 38.  Public aircraft may carry  a radio-telegraphic  apparatuson  board,  but  cannot use it, without;  special  permission,except when the  safety of tho  aircraft is concerned.                       ARTICLE 41.  Military aircraft are  the public  aircraft in military sor-vi.ee when  they  are  under the  orders  of  a commander in uniform and havo  on  board  a certificate  proving  their military character.  Besides  the provisions  from  which  public  aircraft areexempted  by article  40,  paragraph 2, the  &quot;provisions ofarticles 6 to 10, 35,  and  37  do not apply to military air-craft.  Military  aircraft  come  under  the special   provisions ofarticles 43 and  16.                       ARTIOLK  12.  The only  distinctive national mark borne by military air-craft  will be the Sovereign emblem of  their  State.   Eachcontracting  State  shall  notify the  other States  ol&apos; the sovereign emblem which,  it  will  use.                      ARTICLE 43,  In  cases  where any communication  has to be  made  bytho commander of  a military aircraft, ho will notify thecompetent authorities of the country;  if the  latter are. notmilitary authorities, they will inform  the  military  authori-ties without delay.                       ARTICLE 44.  The departure  or landing  of the military aircraft of acontacting State  in the territory of another State will onlybe allowed with the latter&apos;s authorisation.  Moreover, each  contracting State is free  to forbid,  orto regulate, as its interests  demand,  the passage of themilitary aircraft  of the other contracting States over  its territory.                        ARTICLE 45.  Nevertheless, a sojourn required  by necessity  cannot be refused  to  the military aircraft of a  contracting  State.  A military aircraft which, in such  case  of  necessity, isabove a foreign territory,  shall give the  signal  of distresslaid  down  in article  10 of  Annex (C), and shall  effect a landing  as  quickly  as possible.  Immediately after landing, the commander of the aircraftshall .notify the  competent  authority of the  country, as defined in  article 43.  The military authorities  will make an   examination  and decide upon  the  necessity  of  the landing.                        ARTICLE 46.  When tho  sojourn  of the  military  aircraft within  thelimits of. and above, the territory of  a foreign State, is tobe  regarded  as legitimate in  conformity with  articles 44and 45, such  aircraft  shall  enjoy the privilege  of  extra-territoriality.  Similarly the members of the crew wearing uniform shall enjoy  extra-territoriality, so long  as  they do not  cease toform a distinct unit or are carrying  out  their duties.  The authorities of  tho  country are  not, however,  pre-cluded  from applying to the military aircraft  of  anothercontracting State, and to their crews, the measures  requiredeither to assure the safety of the State, or the  observance of sanitary  regulations, or to  protect lives and propertyfrom imminent  danger.

An airship under way, that is to say,  moving under its own power, must carry:    (a.) At tho  bow,  a brilliant  white light arranged  in         such a manner as to throw an uninterrupted beam        over a horizontal arc of  220 degrees, that is to say,         from right ahead to 110 degrees on each side.   (b.) On tho right, a green light arranged in such a manner        as to throw an uninterrupted beam over tho whole         of a horizontal arc of 110 degrees, that is to say,        from right ahead to 20  degrees abaft the beam on        the left.   (c.) On the left, a  red light arranged in such a  manner        as to throw an uninterrupted beam over the whole        of the horizontal arc of  110 degrees, that is to say,        from right ahead to  20  degrees abaft the beam  on        the left.   (d.) The three  lights white,  green, and red must  be        visible in each vertical plane corresponding to their        respective  zones  in  each   direction,  comprised        between  the  vertical  downwards  and the  line  as        nearly as possible approaching to the vortical, and        making  an angle of  at  least  30 degrees above  tho        horizontal.   (e.) The green  and red side lights must also be provided        with shields or screens, arranged  in such a  manner        that their  light cannot be seen on the opposite side.   (/.) The white light must be visible at  a  distance of at        least 4 kilom. and the green and  red side lierhts at        a distance of  at least 2 kilom. on a dark night with        a clear atmosphere.   (g.) An airship  shall,  moreover,  be  provided with  the        means of showing occasionally a white light  astern,        if overtaken by another  aircraft.   ARTICLE 3. lights  to be carried by Flying Machines.   The rules  relative to lights are, in  principle, applicableto flying machines, but, as a temporary  concession, they need only carry a single lamp or beacon,  arranged  in sucha  manner as to show a green light to the right and a  redlight to the left.   The angles of  visibility in  the horizontal  must be those laid down in the case of  airships.  So far as the angles ofvisibility in  the vertical  and  the minimum radius  of visitors-bility of the  lights  are concerned, it is simplv recommendedthat the  regulations  prescribed  for  dirigible  balloons  befollowed as closely as possible.192    ARTICLE L-Lights  to  be carried  by Free Balloons.  Free balloons must always carry ready  for use a  whitelight,  which must be displayed on the approach of anotheraircraft.                   II__Audible Signals                       ARTICLE  5.  (a.)  During fog, mist, snow, or heavy rains aircraft must,by  day as well as by night, make use of powerful, discon-tinuous, audible signals.  (b.)  In the same circumstances,, free halloons must also make use of such signals whenever they are in the neighbour.hood of  motor-driven aircraft.  (c.)  The above regulations only apply to flying machinesso far  as is practicable.      Observations and Recommendations of SpecialCommittee No. 2  of  the Civil Aerial  Transport Committee.  The  regulations  containedin this  Article  are  substan-tially those which are in force at the  present  time for  thonavigation  of naval  airships,and  except  that an additionalregulation  should  bo   madeproviding  for  a   top   light,throwing   an   uninterruptedbeam in a  vertical   directionupward,  the  Special   Com&apos;mittee approve this Article.   The present  regulations in the case of naval and military flying-  machines  provide for port   and  starboard  lights (red  and  green respectively, but showing in  each case  a white  light  straight  ahead) and a  white tail light.   Difficulty  is experienced in preventing the  lights  being masked when viewed  from cer- tain angles, and investigation is proceeding for  the purpose of overcoming this difficulty.   It will be observed  that the rules laid down in this Article are not so  precise as the exist. ing   regulations,   and   the Special Committee recommend that  the  international  rules shall be  so drawn up, in con- sultation with the flying au- thorities of the  Allied Govern- ments,  as  to  include   more definite  provisions as to the lighting  of flving machines   The  Special Committee re- commend that the white  light referred to  in  this Article should be  displayed   by  free balloons  at all  times during the   period   mentioned  in Article 1.   As  regards paragraphs (a) and (b) the Special Committee are of opinion that paragraph (a) should  be made applicable to airships and free  balloons, and that paragraph (b) should consequently be deleted.   With  regard  to paragraph (c) the  Special   Committee understand that the  difficul- ties of providing  a   satisfac- tory audible signal as between flying  machines  are   insuperable- able,  and  that  therefore this paragraph  cannot stand in its present  form.    It  is under- stood,  however, that the pos- sibility  of  providing  aero- planes  with magnetic or wire- less  signalling  apparatus  isnow being investigated,  and should any simple system be successfully devised  the  Spe- cial Committee think that aninternational  regulation  en- forcing its  use would  be desir-able.

A motor-driven aircraft must always  keep at a distance of  at  least  100  metres from another   aircraft  in  every direction, whether horizontal, vertical, or oblique.                        ARTICLE 7.  Motor-driven aircraft must always  make way  for  freeballoons.                        ARTICLE 8.  When two motor-driven aircraft are  Hying on  courses which cross in such a way as to give reason to fear a collision,the aircraft  which sees the other on  the right of  its owncourse and maintain its speed.  When, in  accordance  with the above rule, one of  the air-craft has to change course,  the other must keep  its owncourse and maintain its speed.                        ARTICLE 9.  Every motor-driven aircraft which, in accordance with theabove  rules,  has to give way to another aircraft, must, if circumstances permit, take care not to cross in front of theother aircraft.                        ARTICLE  10.  When two motor-driven aircraft  meet  head on or nearly so,  following opposite or almost  opposite courses, at altitudeswhich only differ slightly, so that a  collision is to  be feared.each must turn to the  right  so  as to pass  the other on  itsleft.                        ARTICLE  11.  Notwithstanding any of  the  rules laid down in the pre-ceding  articles,   every   motor-driven  aircraft  overtakinganother must steer clear of the latter&apos;s course.  An aircraft overtaking another is  an aircraft which nearsanother on  a course which  meets the latter&apos;s wake  at  anangle of more  than 20 degrees that is  to say, which is insuch a position in regard to the aircraft which it overtakesthat it  could not,  at night,  perceive either of the latter&apos;aside-lights.   No later change in the  position of the  two air-craft can make the aircraft which overtakes  the other con-sidered to bo  CROSSING   the latter&apos;s  route, in the sense  ofArticle 8, nor  can such change relieve it from the  duty ofsteering clear  of  the latter&apos;s course until it  has  absolutelypassed  it.                        ARTICLE 12.  Whenever  the necessary manoeuvres are not specified intho preceding  rules,  the aircraft which  have to manoeuvrecan do  so vertically as  well as horizontally.                        ARTICLE  13.  IN  CASE OF  IMMINENT  COLLISION,  the  two  aircraft mustmanoeuvre as best they  can.   In  particular, the highest musttry to ascend and the other to descend.  When they are on the same level and crossing one another,whichever sees the other on the right of its own course mustascend, and  the other must descend.                        ARTICLE 1-1.  When an airship has stopped  voluntarily, it must displaya conspicuous  black  ball;  it is then  subject to the samerules as an aircraft under way.  If it  is no longer under  control  owing to a breakdown of anv  kind, it  must  display two conspicuous black ballsplaced vertically one above the other; it will then be treatedas a free  balloon.  At nisht in both cases, it shall only display a white light,and shall  be  treated as  a free balloon.           IV.-LUNDING AND DISTRESS SIGNALS.                        ARTICLE 15.  When an  airship is about  to  land it must   Bi/ DAY, display a triangular  red flag on the underside ofthe car.  BY NIGHT,  wave  or flash  a  white  light, at the same timekeeping the  regulation side lights burning.      Observations and Recommendations of Special committee I No. 2  of tho Civil! Aerial Transport  Committee. [   Articles G to 13 inclusive.  These   Articles,   although they contain rather  more de-tailed provisions  as to the pos,sibilities  of collision, closelyresemble  the  regulations  for preventing collisions in the aitdrawn up in 1912 by the RoyalAero Club,  which are in forcoin the United Kingdom at thepresent time.  The  Special  Committee arcof opinion  that  the  rules  ofthe Royal  Aero  Club should form the  basis of tho collisionrules  in  any  future  Conven.tion, with tho  addition of thefollowing  two  suggested rulldealing with the  possibility olcollision     between    flyingmachines  and  airships:    1.  A flying  machine muslalways keep at a  distance of alleast 200 metres in every direc-tion  from an  airship.  2.  Flying  machines  muslalways make way for airshipsand free balloons, and airshipsmust always make way for fretballoons.  In  all  the  circumstance!mentioned in this  Article thepresent practice for an airshipis to employ wireless signallingor  signalling  by  flash-light.The  Special Committee are ofopinion   that   this  Articleshould be re-drafted so  as to accord with the present VM&apos;tice.  The present system of land-ing signals  in &apos;tne case of  air-ships is by  wireless or flash-light by day  or night; in thecase of flying machines no par-ticular  regulation  is in foresuniversally,   although Verejlight signals are used at night,and can also be employed by day.  The Special Committee  areof  opinion  that  this  Articleshould be re-drafted so as toapply  the  present  systemlanding  signals  to  airship!and that in the case of flyingmachines   the    regulations should be the subject of  dis-eussion  with  Allied Govern-tnents,  always provided  thatthese  regulations    shall   heof the simplest possible char-acter.                Acceptable.
193Acceptable.Acceptable.                       ARTICLE  10.   (a.) In case of distress,  when  above land  or sea, an air- ship  must, so far as possible    By day, uisplay a triangular red flag on tho underside of the  car,  in addition  to the two superposed  black balls mentioned in Article 14.   By night,  wave or  flash a white light,  and at the same time  extinguish the  side lights.   By d ay as  well as  by night, it  can, in addition, make use of an audible signal.   (b.) A free balloon  in distress must    By day, display a  triangular red flag on the underside  of tho car; and   By  night, wave a white light,   By  day as well as by  night, it can, in&apos;addition, make use  of an audible signal.   Wing  Captain  Groves, R.N., a member of Special  Com- mittee No. 2, appended the following  reservation to  these recommendations:      Article 2  (/.) &quot; This Article prescribes for airships dis-   lances of at least I kiloin. and 2 kilom. at which the white   light  and the coloured side  lights respectively are to be  visible on a dark night with a  clear  atmosphere.  In my   opinion,  in view of  the  increased speed of aircraft, tho  rule should be amended so as  to provide  minimum dis-  tanees  of visibility of 0  and i)  kilom respectively fn the  case of small  airships, and of  8 and  I  kiloin,  respec-   tivcly  in tho case of  large airships.  Such an  amendment   is desirable when  the very short time which a modern  aeroplane takes  to traverse,  eg.,  a distance of 2  kilom,,  is taken into account.&apos;&apos;  Lieutenant-Colonel 0&apos;Gorman, a member of Special Com- mittee No. 2, appended the following  reservation to  these recommendations:      Audible  Signals. &quot;In  so  far  as  these  signals aro  intended to warn aeroplanes of  the presence of airships or  balloons, such signals are of little value,  and if the avoid-  ance of collision with aeroplanes is one of  the chief reasons  for  carrying such signals on airships then it is not worth  while  to impose the carrying of  the appliances for making  audible signals on such  craft;  a wireless or other signal  of more universal utility would  be far preferable in  time  of fog.&apos;&apos;  Special Committee No. 2 appended the following generalnote to  their recommendations:    &quot; It will be observed that the Draft Convention contains  no regulations as to flying into and  out of aerodromes.  Although the general rules of the air  would apply to such  flying, it seems to  the Special Committee that some aero-  drome  regulations  of a quite general  character should be  made   the  subject  of international  agreement.    Such  regulations as have been  drawn  up in the United Kingdom  are  not completely satisfactory, and  the Committee are  not in a position to recommend a detailed  code.   At  certain stations the following system  is in  vogue for con-  trolling inward-and outward  traffic.   Large movable  arrows are employed, which can be illuminated at night,  and which  indicate  always the direction  of  the ground  wind; or, in the absence  of wind, the  best lie of the land.  This enables pilots Avho arrive to land head to wind, while  those who start away on  a  flight also  do  so head to wind.  Some  additional and equally simple  rule is necessary to  prevent the possibility of collision between a  machine  which is spiralling  clown  to reach the  aerodrome and one  which is gliding  in straight ahead, and  also between in-  coming and outgoing traffic and any machine which might  be  making  practice  or  pleasure   flights   above   the  aerodrome.&quot;  yote. The following four recommendations were insertedat  the   end  of the Draft Convention for the purpose of putting  on   record  the  views of  particular  delegations,although at the time the provisions  proposed had not  beenaccepted as practicable by  the Conference as a whole:-                    Recommendations  In addition the Conference  makes the following  recom- mendations:     1. That the Governments shall  endeavour to indicate by        clearly visible marks certain points  which  can be        used as  landmarks by  aeronauts, and which should         be placed on  the  ground, or on buildings such  as         railway stations, &amp;c   2. That the Governments shall mark visibly and uniformly         high  tension  electric  wires, and  the  supports  of         aerial cables,  and shall  indicate their  position on         aeronautical maps of the same decimal scale in each         country.   3. That the regulation  of  radio-telegraphic  communica-         tion between aircraft,  the earth, and ships, as well         as all questions of technique and financial  adjust-         ment, shall be submitted  to the forthcoming London         Conference on radio-telegraphy.   4. That the Governments shall study the question  how         far .it would be useful to set  up  an Internationa]         Board for Aerial  Navigation,  and  consider  what         powers should be conferred on  such  a Board.      Observations and Recommendations of Special Committeo No. 2  of the Civil Aerial Transport  Committee.  With regard  to paragraph (a)  the  Special Committeo  aro of  opinion  that   this  para- graph should  bo re-drafted so as to provide for  signals simi- lar  to those mentioned in their recommendation in relation to Article  14, but they think that the  provision  as  &apos; to  audible signals   by  day  and  night should be preserved.  With regard to paragraph (b)  the  Special Committee  ap. prove these regulations.  Tho   Special Committee  are further of opinion  that a short regulation  should be  added dealing with  distress  signals by   flying   machines,  whichmight, take the form of smokebombs or Yerev lights.      Observations and Recommendations of SpecialCommittee No. 1 of the Civil Aerial Transport  Committee.  It is understood  that thismatter was not considered atthe Conference referred to; itis recommended that  it  maybe considered  at the next In-ternational Conference,   thatmay be held on the subject.

196                                          APPENDIX II.                     Interim   Report  of  Special   Committee   No.   2.                                            INTRODUCTORY.       The Special Committee were requested to advise as to  the  practical possibilities of aeronautics  from a   scientific  and technical point of view, with special reference to certain detailed subjects which of necessity   call for consideration in connection with  this branch of the Main Committee&apos;s enquiry.  Before these detailed   subjects are dealt with, the Special Committee think it advisable  to emphasise some general  considerations.   Since  aeronautics represent in their  civil and commercial aspect an untried field of enterprise,  it is impossible   to  arrive  at very definite  conclusions in many  of  the subjects considered by the Special Committee, par-   ticularly owing  to the fact that the technical  and scientific data at present obtainable are applicable to air-   craft used only for naval and military purposes, and to conditions of flight varying widely from those which   will prevail after the  war.  In this  connection, it  should  be remembered that the  whole trend of design   has been towards efficiency in the fighting  machine, atid, consequently, there has  been little opportunity for   research and enquiry into possibilities of the commercial, uses of aeroplanes and airships.       The same considerations apply to those branches of the Special Committee&apos;s  enquiry which deal  with   the practical running  of aerial services on commercial lines.       With  regard to the detailed subjects assigned for consideration by the  Special Committee,  these have   been in most  cases referred either  to small sub-committees or individual members  of the Special Committee,   and the present report is intended  to present  the conclusions which can be drawn from the materials supplied   in  this manner.   The Main  Committee will observe that it has not been possible  as yet  to cover the whole   field of enquiry, but it has been thought that the conclusions at present reached  can conveniently be sum-   marised in an interim report.  It is, therefore, proposed to   deal  with  the different items of  the  terms of   reference  to the Special Committee in order.   1. The possibilities  of the  employment of  aircraft  at  present  and  in the  near future in transporting       passengers,  mails, and parcels  with the estimated limits of their range, weight, carrying capacity, and    -   running costs, based on the assumption of reasonable State  regulation of air traffic, and the  probability       or otherwise of the use of privately owned aircraft by individuals for pleasure  or other purposes.                                          TYPES OF AIRCRAFT,      In considering the possibilities of the employment of aircraft for purposes of the transport of passengers,  mails and parcels, the Special Committee  directed an enquiry* to be made as to (i.)  four existing types of  aeroplane, and (ii.) rigid airships.  These were made the  subject of  reports by Col. 0&apos;Gorman and Mr. Bair-  stow, as to the aeroplanes, and by Wing Captain Maitland,   as to the airships, which are appended  to  the  present Report as Appendices A. and B.   With  regard to aeroplanes, the following four types were selected,IB, viz. :                                                      ...&apos;54&apos;     (i.) The  Handley-Page, with 250 b.p. Rolls-Royce  engines, and the &quot; America &quot; flying boat.       (ii.) The de Havilland 4, with 250 h.p. Rolls-Royce engine or 230 h.p. B.H.P.  engine.       (iii.) The R,E. 8, with the R.A.F. 150  h.p. air-cooled engine.       (iv.) The  Sopwith  &quot;Pup,&quot; with an  80 h.p. Le Rhone engine.  These  types were selected to cover the whole  range of well-known  machines with a view  to estimating the  possibilities of transport from existing data.      Colonel 0&apos;Gorman and Mr. Bairstow presented  the  following general conclusions to the Special Com-  mittee  on the hypothesis of aerial transport in still air.      A. It is profitable, so far as fuel consumption  is concerned,  to fly high.      B. It is profitable, so far as fuel consumption is concerned and so far as the cost of aeroplane construc-          tion is concerned,  to use a heavy  loading of the wings.      C.  Since  high-wing loading means  fast alighting, the provision  of first-class grounds will, it is con-          sidered,  lead to economy of transport.  Your Sub-Committee contemplates landing speeds upwards          of 60  m.p.h.   This does not refer to seaplanes or flying boats.      D. High &quot;speed of flight is in direct conflict with great weight carrying capacity.      E.  It follows from I)  that, in selecting the flying speed of the aeroplane to be used, a compromise must          be struck between the value of  (a) fuel and labour economy and (b) speed or time saving.      F.  As  illustrating  E,  a lightly loaded  aeroplane, such  as is  commonly  used  now, cannot possibly at          120 m.p.h. (low level speed) fly 1,000 miles, that is  to say, there will be no  lift available to carry even          the flyer; whereas, at 80 m.p.h., no  less than 30  per cent, of the gross  weight  of  the aeroplane          becomes available for crew  and commercial load.      G.  The comparatively small importance of rapid climbing in commercial  air work will make the possi-          bilities of combining high speed and weight-carrying much  better than  those  of the modern service          aeroplane.      H.&apos; The cost of production of aeroplanes (taken  over  the range of variations of type presented by the four          service aeroplanes  selected and based on quotations  for large quantities) is roughly proportional to          the total crew and useful load carried; and this in turn is equally proportional to the total gross loaded          weight of the aeroplane, viz., at  war prices about  900 per every 1,000 lbs. of gross weight.      With  regard  to conclusion F,  it  was pointed  out  by way of explanation in a  supplementary note  (at  the end   of  Appendix A)  that  a  comparison   is  drawn  therein  not  between  two  performances  of one machine,  but between  performances of two different  machines; one designed to  fly at 120 m.p.h./a,nd  the other at 80 in.p.h.   Particular attention &quot;is drawn to  the tables annexed to this Report.* With regard to the types of aeroplanes selected, it should ho noted that this enquiry was directed in July, 1917.
    These conclusions were discussed by the Special Committee, and a further report  was  asked for  IroniCol 0&quot;Gorman and Mr. Bairstow as to the effect in a  1,000-mile journey of an adverse wind on the choice of the flight speed of  an aeroplane.  This further report is  appended as Appendix  0.  The table attached telthis further report sets  out the available weight of crew and  commercial load per 1,000 lbs. of total loaded ifweight, as affected by adverse and favourable winds over the journey named.    Tn  making any definite recommendations as to commercial transport by aeroplane the Special Committeehave Pelt that, for the reasons stated in the beginning of this report, it is impossible at the present stage to fixupon  any particular type, and,  therefore,  they  present the following general  conclusions from the technical point of view.                                 CONCLUSIONS AS TO AEROPLANES.      (i.)  That for commercial success  speed is probably the most material factor.     (ii.)  That for commercial success the  speed needed depends very greatly on the conditions of competing          methods.   Between large centres connected by  direct high speed railways, ground  speeds  of 100          miles  per hour are desirable;  but for  linking places between which the railway service is slow  or          interrupted by sea crossings, lower speeds will be found commercially practicable.    (iii.)  That,  at present, stages of about 500 miles would be the normal limit, but that it  will hp desirable          from the commercial point of view that stages should be as long as possible.     (iv.)  That it is  desirable as speedily as possible to develop the existing facilities for night flying, especi-          ally for the carriage of mails.     (v.)  That heavy loading  is necessary for commercial success,  but, since this will involve a high landing           speed,  development of land and  air  brakes is  necessary.     (vi.)  That in view of certain disadvantages of high landing speed, efforts should be made to keep loading          as low as possible consistently with securing a commercial rate of speed and to provide for aero-          dromes and landing places possessing  the best possible surfaces, and that it may well be hoped that          future inventions  and improvements in design will enable a lower landing speed to be attained with-          out sacrifice of flying speed.                                              ATI! SHIPS.     With regard  to  airships, the report of  Wing Capt. Maitland is appended to this Report as Appendix ll,jThe Special Committee desire to draw special attention to the fact that in airships above a certain size theproportion of available  lift, i.e., crew, fuel, ballast, passengers  and  merchandise,  to total  weight  increases rapidly, rising  to as much  as  50 per cent, in  the case of a  rigid airship with  a  gross lift of  60 tons, of2,000,000  cubic feet  capacity, and, therefore, from the commercial point of view there are obvious advantages in having airships of large- size.  Further,  the conclusion can be  drawn from that report that increase in sizecan be readily accompanied by increase in speed, as the weight of additional engines  would occupy  a very small proportion of  the extra lift.  The proportion of disposable  lift in the case of non-rigid airships is less. at least in the  case  of non-rigid  airships of the largest size at present known.  The Special Committee have come to the conclusion that for commercial purposes  the  rigid type  offers  certain advantages over the non- rigid.   In a further report (Appendix  D) Captain Maitland works  out some valuable statistics as to the effectjj of adverse wind and  ascent in a  1,000 mile journey.                                              PRIME COST.     It is  practically impossible  to give any satisfactory estimate  of running costs of either type of aircraft from  existing data.   With regard to  the  prime cost of  machines, Appendices A and B  contain  curves showing  the relation of gross weight to cost and  useful load to cost, based on approximate war prices.     General figures  relating to cost must be considered  as indicative only ; the weight of an aeroplane is  not :a definitely fixed quantity, and the amount of  commercial load depends on the length  of journey.  An uppei limit  to  the amount of  commercial load is given in Appendices  A  and  B  under the name  of &quot;  dispos- able load,&quot; this term including both crew and  fuel.  A lower limit is obviously zero when the journey is so long that the whole  of the &quot; disposable load &quot;  is absorbed by the crew and fuel.     Figures qualified as above are :                                         Prime cost per lb.  Prime cost per lb. of     Prime cost per lb. oi                                        of gross weight.    disposable load.          commercial load.

The question of the carriage of passengers or of goods  has not yet been considered  by the Committeeexcept from the technical point of view of the range  and weight-carrying capacity of aircraft generally, butthe Committee hope at an early date  to report further on  this important branch of their  subject, and on theclosely connected question of the probability of the use of privately-owned aircraft by individuals.   In regardto what  follows with respect to air mail services it should  be understood that the Committee consider thatin so far as the useful load-carrying capacity of the aircraft is not fully occupied by the transportation of mailsit  should be employed in the conveyance of passengers and even of small parcels of valuable goods.        ^    It has been pointed out above that  it is desirable from  the  commercial point of view  that  stages should  beas long as possible.  This principle is illustrated with peculiar clearness  in the case  of mail services.   a london-Paris air  service,  for  example, should be effected in    hours, or  less,  as against,  say, seven hoursby the land or sea route.  An air mail service would here enjoy a  very evident advantage as compared with.any other.   With longer Continental flights, such as that from London to Paris, and then on to Turin, greater
197     The case is naturally different as regards air mail communications within  Great Britain.  In  the  case of services  from London to large provincial towns,  it may be said to require a flight of at least three hours, at an average, say, of  .100  miles an hour, for the speed of an air-mail service to reveal itself and for this speed to offer a  sufficiently  marked saving of time over land transit, remembering that one must reckon the time taken in establishing the land connections of an air service.  When an oversea journey is made,  such as the passage across the Irish Sea in  a flight to Dublin, the saving of time offered by an air service is  much more &quot;evident, and  the  same  holds good  in  the case of cross-country  routes, e,g.,  from  Cardiff  or   Bristol to Southampton,  where  express rail services  are lacking.   Attention  is  drawn  to  Appendix E,  outlining a scheme for an  experimental  air-mail between London and Glasgow.  Mr. Murray, criticising this memoran- duni at the meeting  of the Special Committee  on October 12th. considered that a load of 100 lbs. of mails per machine,  and not 1,000 lbs., was all that could be hoped for, at any rate, in the early stages of such a service. Mo definite figures have been arrived at, so far, as to the financial aspects of an air-mail service.  In Appendix B; jnst referred to,  Mr.  Holt-Thomas&apos;s estimate  of 4s. 8d.  a mile for overhead  charges and running  costs for an air-mail service between London and Paris (as outlined in his  lecture before the  Aeronautical  Society on May 80th, 1917)  was adopted in the absence of other data.    So far as a service  in the  United Kingdom is concerned,  assuming the correctness of Mr. Murray&apos;s view that only a very  limited volume   of express mails  would be available (having  regard to  the excellence  of existing methods  of communication), then  it would become necessary  to charge some high fee, such as Is. or more per letter,  if there is to be any  hope of an air-mail service proving remunerative.   The Committee, however, are sanguine enough  to hope that Mr. Murray&apos;s estimate may be somewhat too conservative, and the matter is being considered in greater detail.    In view of the great advantages  anticipated in suitable instances, the Special Committee definitely recom- mend the institution of experimental mail services without waiting for the end of the war, if this is consistent with Naval and Military interests, but Mr.  Murray desires to record  his opinion that the out-of-pocket cost, if any, of such experimental services, should be borne, not  by the vote for the G.P.O., but by  that of the Department most immediately concerned, presumably  the Air Ministry. II.  The possibility of little-known or  unexpected inventions modifying the lines of present development.    The Special Committee concur in the following conclusions drawn up by Lord Montagu.  Mr. Lanchester, and Mr. Wells on this branch  of their inquiry.    &quot; It is considered that, whilst there may be considerable  development in the  appliances  for  flying  at present known and available, namely, the aeroplane and the  airship or dirigible balloon,  and in the engines they use, these developments afford no prospect of more than a quantitative modification of existing conditions.    &quot;  So far as the  aeroplane is concerned,  there is every  probability of considerable improvement.   Such things as an increased use of folding wings, a device already used by  the B.N.A.S., minimising the storage capacity required and improving braking mechanism-under  which head we  may include reversible engines and propellers, and  other forms of brakes-diminishing the amount of space needed for landing, may be anti- cipated.  Beyond this, it is thought, that an all-round improvement  in efficiency and weight-saving may be expected.   These improvements will  probably  only slightly modify the general outline of the problem.  The helicopter has been  considered,  as well as possible combinations of airship and aeroplane.   The latter alone seems to involve the remotest possibility of affecting present practice to any serious  extent.    &quot; On the question of fuel, every effort should  be made by  State aid or State encouragement to widen the basis of fuel production as much as possible,  and to prevent the enormous interests  in connection  with auto- mobilism, both on land and in the air, being  dependent upon fuel of  any one given kind, especially if that be. derived from  overseas or  foreign sources of  supply.  Attention is  called to the  fact that fuel  supply for aircraft cannot be  considered apart from the fuel supply of  motor vehicles of other kinds, i.e.,  private cars, buses,  lorries,  etc.  Whereas on  the fuel question, as in the case of the machines themselves, there is no  sign at present  of any  revolutionary  development, the fact must be recognised that it  may  at any time become possible by chemical discovery to produce volatile hydro-carbon fuels in great quantities at comparatively small cost.  While it cannot  be definitely asserted  that undiscovered methods of synthetic production  exist, it isknown that in the matter of chemical  discovery the possibility is always there, and it is not possible to  say, when speaking of fuel, that the  future can be forecast with any degree of certainty.&quot;    In addition to these conclusions  the  Special Committee are of opinion that the following lines of inven- tion are of  great importance to commercial  aeronautics, viz., the gyroscope and its incidental uses,  the turbine system applied to combustion engines, and directional wireless.    savings of time should be possible as compared with existing means of communication.  In the case of the    Italian mail, the time saved might amount to as much  as a day.  The longer  the flight the more important    is the time  saved, and, consequently, the better are the prospects of  an aerial mail service.   There is, forMl example, nothing impossible, given the proper  facilities, in sending mails by  air from London to Calcutta in    lour days, as against sixteen days (minimum), or from London to Johannesburg in six  days as against nineteen.    When the importance to business of full and rapid communication, and the great cost of trans-ocean cabling    is borne in mind, it appears  perfectly  reasonable to anticipate  that people will be willing to pay a price per    ounce for letters carried  by aircraft sufficient to make these  long distance air mail services commercially profit-    able. A cable message of  1.00 words from London to Johannesburg to-day, at  2s. fid. a word, costs  .4-8 10s.,    and 2-1  hours at least usually elapse between the despatch of a message from London and its delivery to the    addressee.  A letter of 5,000 words need not weigh more than an  ounce or two.   If such a letter could be sent    in  six days, even  at 2s.  Gd. an  ounce,  the saving in cost would be enormous, and  the extra  time taken  by    this means  of communication as compared with the cable would  in many cases be more than compensated  for    by the  avoidance of the risk of misunderstanding inseparable  from  the  use  of the  necessarily  abbreviated    language of cable  messages.
III. The Rules that will be required for aerial traffic regulation, routes, and zones, signalling  and lighting of     routes and landing places, night flying, wireless communication, dissemination of meteorological informa-     tion, safety appliances and prohibited areas, illustrated by one or more actual routes assumed to be in use     by an organised aircraft service.                                        RULES OP THE AIR,     With regard to rules for aerial traffic regulation, viewed from the point of view of domestic control, theSpecial  Committee  approve of the existing code of rules drawn up by the Royal Aero Club.   These rules areappended as Appendix F. to this report:  These rules are aimed mainly at preventing collisions in the air, ancUsome additions will be necessary to deal with  problems arising from  the  ascent from and descent to aero-?dromes.  The Special Committee will report further on such additions when they  have had the opportunityof considering certain military and  naval  regulations to be applied in the case of existing aerodromes.   Withregard to traffic regulations from  the international point of view, the Special Committee  are  proposing toreport to Special Committee  No. 1,  particularly as to certain  proposed  regulations  contained in the  3rdAnnex to the Draft Convention of Paris of 1910, which will require revision in the  light of the recent develop-ments of aeronautics generally.     The Special Committee do not at present make  any recommendation as to different altitudinal zones for different types of aircraft, although they recognise that in the  future some  regulation on  this subject  may become  necessary.                                   AIR ROUTES GENERALLY.     In  considering  the planning  and definition of particular air routes, certain general considerations arise,In the case of a commercial aerial service  the route will generally begin or end at some large town or centre of population; but its course may vary in accordance with  the needs of intermediate towns  in  a  populatedcountry and in accordance with the factors of prevailing winds  and landing  facilities  in the case either  of long journeys over undeveloped countries or of long journeys over the  sea.     In the two latter instances the necessity for a planned and defined route is sufficiently obvious,  for in thecase of a flight over, e.g., Africa,  the provision of landing facilities on a liberal scale is impracticable,  and inthe case  of a flight  from America  to Europe prevailing winds will play  a large part in fixing  outward  andhomeward tracks.   In the United.Kingdom, or at any rate in England, present  and future military require-ments will  involve the creation of a large number of landing grounds, but where  mails have to  be  delivered,the provision of  definitely marked routes is necessary for  the sake of economy, speed, reliability, and safety of navigation.                               LANDING GROUNDS  ON AIR ROUTES.     As to the provision of alighting grounds, the Special  Committee have not felt  justified in committing themselves to a definite  recommendation  that landing places are  required  at  fixed  distances   along aerialroutes.  What it is  thought will happen, in the ordinary course of development,  will be for main aerodromesto be established in  the neighbourhood of the large centres of population, and then  for these main aerodromesto be connected by  the institution of subsidiary aerodromes near  smaller centres  of population; while purelyemergency landing grounds along the various routes will be placed, not so much with the idea of their being at regular intervals, but rather with a view to providing safe  alighting  points in localities where the  nature  ofthe country might render dangerous an  involuntary descent.     To illustrate the problems which may arise as to  aerial routes, the Committee desire to  draw attention tocertain conclusions  which may be drawn  from reports obtained  from their members as  to certain specifiedroutes arbitrarily chosen.  These reports were submitted to the Committee by the following members :          (a)  London-Edinburgh-Glasgow-Dublin-London.   (Major-General Ruck.)         (b) London to the Riviera.                             (Mr. Holt Thomas.)         (c) London to South Africa                           (Lord Montagu.)         (d) The Atlantic Route.                               (Commander Porte.)         (e) London-Norway-Sweden-Russia.               (Major-General Ruck.)     In drawing  up  these reports it has not been possible to work out in detail  the  precise provision that willbe required  on each for signalling and lighting and for other matters mentioned in heading  III. (quoted above) of the terms  of reference to the Special Committee.  Decisions as to what  is required in these respectson  particular  routes can only  be  arrived at by actual experiment, and the Special Committee have thereforeconfined themselves to such general propositions as can be affirmed with some measure of  confidence  in  thelight of existing knowledge.                  LONDON-EDINBURGH-GLASGOW-DUBLIN-LONDON.     As to (a)  it appears that, so far as the existence  of landing grounds is  concerned, the most  attractiveroute northward at  the present time would  follow the line.of the Great Northern and North-Eastern Rail-ways, via Berwick.   In so far as the route to Edinburgh is viewed in the light of direct transit, regardless of intermediate  stops,  this line offers the greatest advantages on the score of time-saving; but when the possi-bilities are  considered of linking up important centres of population, a route to the westward covering, e.g.,Bedford, Northampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Leeds may be preferable.  As against this routeit  should be mentioned that in some conditions of weather pilots prefer to proceed along the coast as far aspossible.  The creation in the future of further landing facilities  may considerably modify  conclusions as tothe best  route to Edinburgh from the commercial point of view, and the possibility of planning a routegenerally to the westward of the East Coast line  must not be lost sight of.     The route from Edinburgh to Dublin might pass Glasgow and Belfast, via Kilmarnock, Ayr,  Stranraer,Belfast, Portadown, Dundalk, and Drogheda.  On this section the route is more or less undeveloped as far aslanding grounds are concerned.          .                                                           &apos; J     From Dublin to London the route might follow the track of the mail steamers to Holyhead, and thencethe line of the present London and  North-Western Railway, via Chester and Crewe, assuming it to be a partof what  would ultimately become a West Coast route to  Scotland, via Manchester and  Liverpool.   Atpresent  there are obiections to a West Coast route to Scotland, owing to  the  mountainous nature of thecountry north of Carlisle and the absence of landing grounds. In fact, the most direct line from North Wales
1u[o London would turn off near St. Asaph and go straight  to  Birmingham.   Landing  facilities  from  themilitary point of  view already  exist  on this route from  Tern Hill, near Market Dray ton, through Birming-jham, Coventry, Rugby, and Aylesbury.                                   LONDON TO THE RIVIERA.    As to (b), the route from  London  to the Riviera, this does not call for much comment, except that itivill  probably follow the line of Paris, Dijon, Lyons, and Marseilles, showing  a saving of time from  London[o Marseilles of something like  seventeen hours.   An alternative route would be to fly from  Avignon direct toCannes, leaving  Marseilles and Toulon  on the right, thus effecting a considerable saving in distance.                                  LONDON TO SOUTH AFRICA.   As to (c) the routes from London to South Africa, Lord Montagu furnished particulars of an  Easternroute, via Marseilles, Naples, Crete, Egypt, and the Valley of the Nile, and Northern Rhodesia, and a Westernroute, via Bordeaux, Gibraltar, and the Sahara, Lagos, Angola, and Rhodesia.   The total distance of theEastern route is some  7,800 miles, and the Western route some  7,210  miles.   On  a theoretical  basis of a speed of 80 miles per hour and continuous flying for twenty-four hours per  day, the time taken by the Easternroute would be 4 days  1  hours, and by the Western route 3 days 18 hours.  Lord Montagu pointed out in his report that  meteorological conditions,  generally speaking, favoured  the  use of  the Eastern route from theUnited Kingdom to South Africa and the use of the Western route on the return journey from South africa to the United Kingdom.  Whichever route may in the future be found to be the better, or whether it may befound desirable to operate both, the Committee can at this stage only recommend that a practical experimentshould be instituted on either or both routes at as early a date as possible.  The Eastern route would appearto be commercially the more important,  and would pass mainly over British territory.   It would be easy to exaggerate the importance of  this latter consideration  in connection with  future  commercial aerial trafficgenerally, but for the purposes of conducting an experiment there  are obvious advantages in  having to dealwith territory under the  jurisdiction of His Majesty rather than with foreign territory.THE ATLANTIC ROUTE.    As to (d), the Atlantic route, Commander Porte pointed out in his report that for some time to come adirect route from Ireland to Newfoundland and vice versa will be found impracticable.   He suggested that theonly possible solution of the  Trans-Atlantic route at the present time and for many years to come, would beto use  the  so-called &quot;Azores&quot; route, employing San Miguel, the principal island of the Azores, as a landingstation.  To avoid the great  distance of a direct flight from the United Kingdom to San Miguel, he recom-mended a route from London via Paris,  Madrid, and  Lisbon, the  distance from Lisbon to  San  Miguelbeing  775  miles.  Prom  San Miguel to Newfoundland is 1,346 miles, although this distance could be reducedto 1,045 miles by calling at  Flores, another of the Azores group.  The use  of Newfoundland as a terminuspresents great difficulty owing to continual fog on the  banks and around Newfoundland itself. *  The effect ofthis  fog is to make a journey westward  to Newfoundland  liable to the danger and  uncertainty  involved  in having to come  down to land through the fog.  The same difficulty does not occur in the eastward  journeyfrom Newfoundland, in that the pilot can lay his course by the compass and would wdthin a comparatively short period find himself outside the fog area.    Commander Porte&apos;s conclusion is that, at any rate in the immediate future, it would be preferable to fixupon New  York as the  Western terminus of the  Atlantic  route.   The distance  from  San Miguel  to LongIsland is roughly 2,250 nautical miles, and Commander Porte suggests that  for the purpose of  dividing this long distance into reasonable stages, it would  be  necessary to design and arrange for &quot; Sea Stations,&quot; in the shape  of long ships of, say,  600 ft., with a clear upper deck of 400 ft., fitted with wireless and the necessarysignalling apparatus.   Such  an arrangement would  make possible the use of aeroplanes rather than seaplanes.    While Commander Porte is  a high authority, the Special Committee do not feel  that they  possess suffi-cient independent information to enable them to express a confident opinion with regard to his conclusions.  Sofar as  these are  based upon the prevalence of fog on the Newfoundland coast, Major Taylor is disposed to thinkthat they are open to question.  Major Taylor&apos;s impression, based upon his study of the  subject, is that the seafogs prevailing off the Newfoundland coast are low in altitude  and do not extend far inland.   Any further evidence that could be obtained on this point would be  valuable.*    Here,  again,  the  Committee can  only recommend that a  practical experiment should be  instituted  as early as may be possible, all available information as to the weather  conditions likely  to be encountered thatmay be in the possession  of the Meteorological Office or of the Governments of the U.S.A., Canada, and New-foundland having first been studied with a view to undertaking the experiment with the  best chances of success.    This route  would appear to be a particularly suitable one for an experiment with airships as well as withaeroplanes,  the  distance in a direct  line from the East Coast of Newfoundland to the West Coast  of Irelandbeing no more than could be accomplished in favourable weather by airships already in existence.                                       LONDON TO RUSSIA.    As to (e), the route from the United Kingdom to Russia, via Norway and Sweden, it was suggested tothe  Committee that a service might be conducted from  London  to  Yarmouth  by aeroplane,  a distance,approximately, of 100 miles; by seaplane from  Yarmouth to Christianssand, a distance of approximately 450miles; by seaplane from Christianssand to Stockholm,  crossing the Swedish lakes, a  distance of approxi-^ately 360 miles; and, as a final stage, from Stockholm  to Petrograd  by seaplane,  a distance  of approxi-mately 450 miles, crossing the Baltic and continuing up the  Gulf of Finland.  The total distance would beabout 1,360 miles. The progressive reliability of aeroplanes will probably, within a short period, render theuse  of seaplanes unnecessary.  This route, also, might afford a favourable opportunity for the use of airships.*Sce tho heading &quot; Aerial Routes&quot; in the final report^ofthis Special Committee and Appendix B to that report.
                                MARKING OF AERIAL ROUTES.    As to tho marking of aerial routes, several  recommendations have been made.    Wing Captain Groves has suggested that all main routes should he marked at intervals of five miles by3strip, 200  feet  in  length and  16  feet  in  breadth (formed  of  chalk  or small stones treated  with somewhite mixture), each mark pointing exactly along the line  of route.  He recommends, also, that alongsideeach mark  should be  an  alphabetical letter,  50  feet in length,  to  indicate the  routes to which they belong;while, in addition to these letters, each mark  should have its  distinguishing number, in figures 16 feet high,In clear weather these figures would not be required by the pilot, hut in  thick weather, rain, or other adverseconditions, they would help him to  discover his exact whereabouts.    Lieut.-Col.  CGorman, after considering  the memorandum by Captain Groves, suggested that main railwayroutes should be identified by  various combinations of dots  and dashes formed by lines of chalky  stones, bill the representative of  the Board of Trade expressed the view that there  would be serious difficulties  in thepractical working of this proposal.    Generally speaking,  and in the light of  the information before the Special Committee, it would  appealthat in  anything like favourable weather, a  pilot has no  difficulty in finding  his way from point to -noint.correcting his compass course by visual observations of prominent  landmarks, and by following  railwayswhen they  are on his line of flight.  This applies particularly to the aviator  who  flies  frequently over amgiven route,  as, for example, in the case of the &quot; ferry &quot; pilots who take new machines by air from London!to G.H.Q. in France, or  to Montrose in Scotland. These pilots find it so easy to steer an  accurate course kmcompass and visual observations of  landmarks and railways  that they have, apparently, never even eonsidereMthe need for  artificial  markings.                                                                        1    When  clouds are  low, however,  and an aviator may have to fly as low, perhaps, as a few hundred feet in!order to correct his  compass course by an observation of the ground, it is considered that  artificial markings!would be extremely useful; and one suggestion which has been made, and which meets with the  approval oil the Special Committee, is that the roofs of railway stations or sheds should have  their  names painted upon!them in letters large  enough to be distinguished by the pilot of an aircraft.  It would be  of great advantage!that these letters should  be brightly  illuminated at night.    The Special Committee recognise that while it may meet the  case for a military aviator to find his wajlfrom  one landmark to another, or to follow  some convenient railway, even should this take him a little froiilhis course, a commercial pilot,  carrying mails,  say, from  London to Paris, will find any  deviation from  tikidirect line  reflecting itself adversely not only in his time-table, but also in the matter of fuel consumption!It maybe thought  necessary, therefore, by those who  operate  such commercial  services,  to lay  down si  Ivery  clear system  of landmarks, so as to ensure an absolute adherence by their pilots to a given line of flight!The placing  of  such  marks  on  private ground  will, of course, be a matter  of  arrangement between land!owners and  aircraft companies; though it would appear  advisable that there should  be supervision by th!authorities to prevent any possible confusion arising through the use by various companies of different schemes!of marking.                                        NIGHT FLYING.     As to night flying, at any rate on a commercial scale,  it  is  recognised  that  some  special  method olilluminating aerodromes and intermediate points, so as to enable  pilots to land and also to afford them a mean!of checking  their compass course, and to help them in combating the difficulties of ground mists and fogs, will need to be adopted; but  this question has not yet been considered in detail.*                               METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION        .     The dissemination of meteorological information has obviously a very important bearing on the  develop!ment of civil aerial transport, particularly from the point of view  of the safety and punctuality  of   services!which will require to run to time-tables.  Much meteorological knowledge has,  of course, been accumulate!for many years by  the Meteorological Office, but, as such knowledge has hitherto been required almost wholljjfor the purpose of  persons moving over the  surface of land and sea, the study  of the meteorology  of the upper!air, which is all-important for the purpose of aeronautics,  is in a  less advanced condition.   The first steps! must be in the  direction of collecting the required body of knowledge  and arranging for the tabulation of the!data, as they vary  from hour to hour.   This involves at  the outset much scientific  study  and  research, ilbranch of our subject which falls primarily  within the scope of Special Committee No.  0, by whom, hollever, we have been supplied with two  valuable papers by  Major  Lyons  and  Sir Napier Shaw, which aril attached as  Appendices  to the interim  report of that Special Committee.                                  j     Assuming measures to have been taken  for the  collection of the necessary  scientific knowledge, it  remains to consider measures for making it  readily and easily accessible to the  pilots and others concerned  for tinpurposes of  practical flying.   Many useful suggestions in regard  to this matter are contained in Sir NapierShaw&apos;s paper, and the subject has also been  dealt with by a Sub-Committee of Special Committee No. 2, colsisting  of Lord Montagu and Major Taylor. Their report,  with  the  conclusions of  which we agree, is appended (Appendix G).  We particularly desire to emphasise  the importance of the  establishment  at eacjmain or &quot; terminal &quot; aerodrome of  what Sir Napier Shaw has described as a &quot; Map room,&quot;  in  charge of alperson  capable  of explaining rapidly and intelligently to  practical pilots the  meteorological conditions likeljat the moment to  be met with  in the vicinity.   Such establishments, if they  are to be  efficient, presupposethe frequent direct communication to them by pilots of information as to the  conditions actually  experiencedby them in their flights.   The importance of making such communications should be impressed  upon pilots,*See heading &quot; Night Flying &quot; in tlie final report of this Special Committee,
199                                       PROHIBITED AREAS      With regard to the question of  prohibited areas, the Special  Committee are not yet in a position  toI submit a report.                                         SAFETY  APPLIANCES      The Commitee have taken into consideration the use of safety appliances in commercial aircraft.  these will  no doubt be largely developed by experiment after the conclusion of the war, and  the Committee would draw special attention to the different lines of enquiry with regard  to safety appliances suggested in a report  by Captain Maitland and  Colonel 0&apos;Gorman (Appendix I), with which the Committee  concur.      IV.  The estimated number, size, and location of landing  grounds suitable  for  an  organised  aircraftIservice, with the technical requirements of management staff and  maintenance and  the estimated runningI cost  of such grounds.                                 LANDING GROUNDS GENERALLY      As  stated earlier in this report, the Special Committee do not advise the provision of landing grounds at  fixed distances on aerial routes, although they hold the view  that in the case of main  routes  the safety and  regularity of commercial services will largely depend on the existence of a sufficient  number of  alighting  points lying along the line  of route.      Generally speaking, the positions selected for aerodromes or landing grounds  should  comply  with the  following conditions :           (1) bear some reference to the direction of the main aerial routes;          (2) be sufficiently  far from the centres of cities to be fairly clear of houses in the direction of flight;          (3) be unlikely to  be shut in by  buildings in the immediate future;         (4) be as far as possible clear of railways, telegraphs, trees, and other obstructions;          (5) be situated on ground as far as possible free from mist and fogs;         (6) be provided with adequate water supply, telephone connections and good facilities for rail, tram,             &apos;bus and motor traffic with the different  districts of the cities to be visited;         (7) be capable of expansion.                     AERODROMES  AND INTERMEDIATE LANDING PLACES     With regard to aerodromes, the Committee has obtained a  report  from Colonel 0&apos;Gorman, Mr. Holt-  Thomas and Mr.  Lanchester, and with regard to intermediate landing places a report from Captain E. Elvey  Robb.  These  reports are attached as Appendices J and  K.  The Committee  agree with these reports gener-  ally,  and consider them valuable as indicating the possible requirements of the future, when there  has been  time  for civil aerial transport to  develop itself on a considerable scale.   As things stand at present, however,  it must be borne in mind that the exigencies of the war have already led to the establishment in all parts of  the country of aerodromes  and landing places with an equipment fully  Sufficient  to  deal with any civil  air  traffic to be expected in the earlier days of peace.  The  reports should not therefore be read as indicating  that  it  will be necessary in the near future to set up  new and elaborate organisations with consequent heavy  expenditure for the  purposes of civil  air traffic alone.    Generally  speaking, the Committee hold the view that,  subject to  necessary military regulations, it  ig  desirable to arrange for the user by  civil aircraft of as many as  possible of the intermediate landing grounds,  which are at present or will in the future be under military control.  i  V-   The estimated cost of maintaining an  aerial  service, including aerodromes, sheds,  landing grounds,  labour,  wages, running expenses, depreciation and repairs, exclusive  of capital charge for the purchase of  machines on the assumption of a route of definite length and the employment  of a definite number of aircraft  thereon.    VI.  To advise in the  light of the answers to the  foregoing  questions as to the main aerial routes which  night be marked  out and prepared for  now for utilisation by an aircraft service.                                                                                                  E I and  commercial machines should be fitted for this as well  as  for  other purposes  with wireless telegraphicli apparatus.  It will anpear from a report by Colonel 0&apos;Gorman and Major Vincent  Smith (Appendix H) thatI this  requirement should eventually present no serious difficulty, since it is to be expected that a ltfrge coin- 1 mercial machine would not be navigated by one pilot working single-handed, but that the pilot would ordinarily 1 be accompanied  by at least one assistant who would be able to send the requisite wireless messages without I difficulty.       Tho Committee  have ascertained from the Admiralty that there exists a  complete  system  of  Naval I Meteorological Stations in the United Kingdom in direct  communication  with  the   Admiralty   Office  in I London.  These stations are run at a small cost, a staff consisting of an officer and three men being sufficient I for day and night  duty.  At most of these stations weather maps can be prepared.  Although these stations I have not been established solely for aeronautical purposes the Committee think that their assistance may well I he invoked in connection with a scheme for disseminating meteorological information,  and at least they can I serve as models for stations to be established in connection with terminal aerodromes.
    On these two branches of  their enquiry the Special Committee are  not yet in a position to submit areport, although certain matters which fall within paragraph VI. have already been touched upon in that partof ithis report which deals with certain specified air routes.-0f)*i $pft.              re &apos;  &apos;             &apos;  -                           .  .

The  landing ground  scheme, in his opinion, should be adopted,  and he sees init the probable solution of many difficulties as regards flying in fog and by night, etc.   He also puts forward the argument that the expense of any such scheme  has already proved to be almost negligible compared withthe cost  of any  service, and that therefore,  taking into  account the  undisputed advantage  offered, he  i3unwilling that this report should go out  without expression of opinion  on his part that the landing groundscheme on all. main  routes should  certainly  be recommended  and adopted.  On this point he  is bound  tototally disagree with  the report, as he considers that in  the  absence  of a landing ground scheme  irregular-larities  in aerial services may  occur which may have a very dangerous effect on the future  of aerial navigation.in the opinion of the Public.SPECIAL COMMITTEE No. 2.-INTERIM REPORT.

Your sub-committee, consisting of 3 members of SpecialCommittee No. 2 of the Civil Aerial Transport  Committee,was asked to consider  the performance and characteristics of 4 aeroplane types and an afrship.*             &apos; &apos;        &apos;: ,,2. The .aeroplanes were  selected to&apos;cover tho whole range of well-known sizes  with a view to  obtaining some  definiteguidance  as  to what types  might best be used for certainpurposes.   The information  asked for is given in fTable I.as. regards aeroplanes,- and  in Table I. of  Appendix  B asregards the airship.          ,  ;r .^3/ Your  sub-committee thinks that.these tables are  not,however,  sufficient to  give  the necessary guidance  for  thefuture.   They  do,  however, establish a statement of  the present position which helps to verify the subsequent esti- mates  herein.   4. Accordingly,   certain  supplementary  work has  been done which  is thought to be far more instructive  and hot less trustworthy as a &quot;basis for considering&apos;the problems. The analysis, which is  given hereafter of the  experimental fact! on the basis of  a  theory which is not seriously contested in any quarter, is used to show the effect of making legitimate variations on known aeroplanes.   5. It will  be best to make clear to the Committee first of all what the conclusions  arrived at are, and then to expose the method of getting at these conclusions and the tabular data which lead to them.  - Supposing that we are dealing with aerial transport&apos;&quot;toj stiUf air. we -find that:        . * :,     A. It is profitable so far as fuel consumption js con-&apos;        cerned  to  fly high.i n  * As totho Airships see Appendix B, p. 64.    t Tables I. and II., owing to their form, are set out after the text on pp. 52,53.
200It is  profitable so  far  as  fuel  consumption is con-cerncd, and so far as the cost of aeroplane construc-tion is concerned,  to use  a  heavy loading of  thoC.D.E.P.wings.       Since high wing-loading means fast alighting, the       provision of first-class grounds will, it is considered,       lead to  economy of transport.   Your sub-committee       contemplates landing fepeeds upwards of 60  m.p.h.       This does not refer to seaplanes  or flying boats.       High speed of flight is in  direct conflict with great       woight-oarrying  capacity.       It follows from D that, in  selecting the flying speed       of the aeroplane  to he  used, a compromise must be       struck  between  the  value of  (a) fuel  and  labour       economy,  and (b)  speed or time saving.       As illustrating E a lightly-loaded aeroplane such as       is commonly used now cannot possibly at 120 m.p.h.       (low level speed) fly 1,000 miles, that is to  say, there       will be no  lift  available to carry  even the  flyer;       whereas, at 80 m.p.h.,  no less than 30 per cent, of       tho gross  weight of the aeroplane becomes  available       for crew and commercial load.       The comparatively  small importance of rapid climb-       ing in commercial  air-work will make the  possibili-       ties of  combining high speed  and  weight carrying       much  better than  those  of  the  modern  service       aeroplane.        Tho cost of production of aeroplanes  (taken over       the range of variations of type presented  by  the       4 service  aeroplanes selected in Table I. p.  51) and       based on  ((notations for large quantities) is roughly       proportional to  the total crew and useful  load car-       ried; and this in turn  is equally closely  proportional       to  the total gros3 loaded weight  of the aeroplane-^       viz., at war prices about  900 per every 1,000  lbs.       of  gross  weight.  The  proportion is shown by the       curves.   (See Table II., p. 52.)  6. Although the war  qualities which have been sought inaeroplanes have,  no doubt, depended (i) on  the skill  of thedesigner, and (ii) on the desiderata which may  have at anytime inspired the drafting of the specifications to which theyhave been  built,  and which have resulted in the creation ofdifferent types, it may be said that difference of performance,speed,  climb, alighting speed and weight lifting  due to (i)are sufficiently  small to  be ignored.  Even the  difference  of performance of the different types arising  from the demand(ii) need not be dwelt upon at the present state  of the dis-cussion. In other words, the performances, which  have, inG.H.fact, often been described as widely different, havo been dueto the amount of load, or  external  impediments imposed ontho craft  by exigencies of the Service when they were putinto use,  or to the  effect  on design of  restricted  landing grounds or  to circumstances  outside  the designer&apos;s controlsuch as his being compelled to use the engine which chancedto be commercially available  when  the  design  was made.  7. It has therefore  been  possible to tako such reasonableaeroplanos as  exist,  and on  the basis of tho above  para-graph  6  to eliminate  what may bo called fortuitous varia-tions,  and to arrive  at conclusions which  aro  given in  thefigures below.  The  figures themselves may be described as&quot; favourable estimate of commercial flying by  aoroplane inthe  near  future.&quot;  It is considered that they will  not  im-prdbably be achieved; somo of the performances shown havebeen realised,  and this realisation  is a  check  on tho otherfigures, based  on  the same analysis,  and hero described asto be reasonably to be foreseen.  8. For a given  external shape of aeroplane  the variation of  the performance,  when the loading (i.e.,  lbs.  per squarefoot of the wing  area)  is varied,  but the total  weight  notaltered is well known  to be expressed by the following rule:---    If the  loading bo changed  in the ratio  w  : 1  and if  the  speed  be increased in the ratio \/w: 1 then the horse  power, necessary for flight  at  tho increased  speed  will be  increased in the ratio \/w 1  9. For a given  external shape of aeroplane  the variation in  performance when the height of  flight is  changed,  butthe total  weight not  altered, is expressed as follows:       &quot; If the height at which the flight is made  be  changed  in  the  ratio p  : 1, and  the  speed  increased in the ratio    I   ^:l,then the horse-power at the new height and speed  will have  to be increased in the  ratio   -j^-l.                                            Vp&apos;  10.  Applying the  two rules of 8 and 9 to a curve which represents approximately  a  number of useful  modern aoro-planes, we get Table III., and attention is drawn to the factthat this table is obtained without making any  assumption asto  engine weight per horse-power, or any assumption  as to therate of fuel consumption per horse-power hour, and that this is  an  essential table  for an estimate of the economics of  the aeroplane.    11.  Later, estimates  are made and introduced for engine weights per  horse-power and rate of fuel consumption, and certain  considerations arising from the introduction are dis- cussed;  but even, if  the estimates of engine weight  and fueJ are considered  optimistic,  Table  III.  gives  data  for  any amended  figures which may be preferred.TABLE III.

Alighting speed greater than 52 m.p.h.	Alighting speed greater than 58 m.p.h.greatly  both with the loading and the  height  at which thoflight takes place.  The  greatest horse-power is needed  near the  ground for light loading per square foot!  The leasthorse-power shown in the table is 34.5  for all  loadings andat moderate heights; smaller values would  occur  at lowerspeeds and light loading,  but 80  m.p.h. was  taken as belowthe  limit  which would  be considered commercially  useful.It then appears from the table that over the practicalrangeit is economical to fly high and heavily loaded.  The heavyloading means a high alighting speed.   In the calculationsit has been assumed  that  a moderate rate of climb near, theground would  suffice for  commercial purposes, the problemdifferentiating itself  markedly from  the military one in thisrespect.   In other words  rapid climb has been  assumed  tobe much  less important than high speed.   14. Before the figures of Tahje III. can be made to serve  12.  To read Table HI. The following is an example  as  a guide, and concerns the figure which has been starred.  the table  says that:      &quot; For a modern aeroplane to fly  at  100 miles per  hour  at ground level  (and of such wing area that the loading is  8 lbs. per square foot) it will be necessary to develop 51.5  h.p. for  each 1,000 lbs. of gross-loaded  weight.&quot;   In the  same  double-lined  enclosure  are figures  on   a  diagonal  reading 51.5; 48.5; 46; 44.5; these represent the horse-I  power required  at ground  level, 5,000  ft., 10,000 ft., and  15,000 ft. respectively;  under  these circumstances, note,  therefore,  these  diminutions  of  horse-power  required to  keep the speed at the increasing heights, and consequently  the diminished  fuel expended.  13. It will be seen  from Table III. that the  horse-power necessary  to   carry 1.000 lbs.  in  level  flight  varies  very
5&apos;2-for  estimates  of  commercial  weight-carrying,  some  figuremust be determined for  the weight of the engine.  At  pre-sent  we  may  take  3.3 lbs. per  b.h.p. for a  water-cooledengine in running order  but without petrol and  tanks.   Thisis a  ground-level  figure which would lead to marked error ifapplied to modern engines at 10,000 ft.,  where  the powerdeveloped is only some 70 per cent,  of  that  at  the ground.If  the  engine is supercharged,  or designed  for tho  high level,  and protected against  abuse at  the ground,  a figuresuch as that above may  be expoctod to  apply approximatelyto all altitudes.   In so far as this condition  is  not  reached,there will be a modification of the following figures which willsomewhat  diminish tho   advantage  of  flying  high.   In ageneral survey this variation may be ignored as  of secondaryimportance.  15. The other  important figure  for estimates  concerns the fuel, which with  tanks will be taken as 0.55 lbs.  per b.h.p.per  hour, a  figure which is  independent of height and  to alarge extent of  size of engine.  The structure  weight will he taken as 33 per  cent,  of the gross weight of the aeroplane.  From  these figures it is easy to  deduce the possibilities of long flights at stated  speeds.  Take, as  a  first  example, anaeroplane having a speed of  120 m.p.h. near  the ground anda loading of 6 lbs. per  sq. foot.  In each 1,000 lbs.  of gross weight:                        330 lbs. is structure                      290 lbs. is engine  in  running order                      100 lbs. for fuel  and oil  for a journey                     -        of 250  miles                     720 lbs.,       87 by 3.3250 by 87 by 0.55 s120leaving 280 lbs.  per  1,000  lbs. gross load  for  crew and com-mercial load.

The position is quite clear &quot;in  its possibilities.   Time andload carried pull in opposite directions.  In  the early stages of development between  tho  transition  from  military to commercial types the slower  machines will probably be most favoured,  the  development of the  120 m.p.h.  service being a  considerable departure from present  practice, needing forits accomplishment an  appreciable time.    For this serviceexcellent landing  grounds aro essential,  although  the  fullaerodynamical possibilities  have not yet been exploited.   Thediscussion  will be left at this stage until further instructions as to  requirements  are given.    There are  many  obviouspoints which  have been  brushed  aside,  but it  is  believedthat the procedure has not led  to substantial loss of  accuracy of statement.

Cockburn.:    It has  been urged  that: contrary  to the  conclusions  inour report a lightly-loaded aeroplane could  be,  and has,.infact, been found which could fly 1,000  miles in one journeyat 120  m.p.h.  The  idea of a &quot; lightly-loaded &quot; aeroplane in present prac-tice is  taken at 0 lbs.  per sq.  ft., and our report  says thatsuch  an  aeroplane cannot  take  a  useful  load for  1,000miles  at 120  m.p.h. near the  ground. This view seems toremain valid after consideration has been taken  of tho De.H.I, which apparently was tho cause of the doubt.
  This machine was loaded in its trials at 7.(J lbs. por sq. ft.,and the  trial took place at .10,000 ft.  (not near  the ground).Taking this  actual loading and altitude and using tho tablesin our report wo get    Table 4.  Speed 120 nn.p.h.  Loading 6 lbs. per sq. ft.  Crew and  commercial load for each 1,000 lbs. gross load fora non-stop journey of  1,000 miles:            Near ground    ..................  0           At  10,000 ft...................  128 lbs.Applied to De.H.  4, which  has  a total weight of about 3,500lbs., the change of level accounts for a useful load  of 450 lbs.Table  4 of  our  report  also  shows  that  the  increase ofloading from 0 lbs. per sq. ft. to the value of 7.9 of  the trialswould further increase the  useful load from -150 lbs. to aboutGOO  lbs.  It is interesting to observe  that  these  results do  not  dis-agree with those quoted in respect of the test of  the De.H.4,viz., that it  has a speed  of 133 m.p.h.  at 10,000  ft. with a useful load of 545 lbs.      Comparison  Between  Fast and  Sloic Machines.  The difference between Mr.  Cockburn&apos;s point  of view  andthat  of  tho  Sub-Committee is of  great  importance.    Mr.Cockburn has taken an aeroplane designed to fly at  133 m.p.h.at 10,000 ft., and has compared the load carried  with thatof the same   aeroplane Hying  at 87.5 m.p.h.  On  the otherhand,  our   report  would  compare  the load  carried  on two  aeroplanes,  one  of which  was designed to fly  at  133m.p.h. and  the other designed to  fly at 87.5 m.p.h.  It isobvious that  in the latter case the  engines  installed  will beof very different sizes, and the  figures in the original report will  be of use to show the effect of  this change of  engine onthe margin of lift available for useful load.  At a speed of133 m.p.h. at 10,000 ft. and a  loading of 7.9 lbs.  per sq. ft.the horse-power required  would be 68 per 1,000  lbs.  of grossload, making 240  h.p. for the De.H.4  at 10,000 ft., or about330 h.p.  at ground level.   To fly at 87.5 m.p.h.  at the sameheight and the same loading would  require 35 h.p. per 1,000lbs., or a total  of nearly 120 h.p.  at  10,000 ft.  At 3.3 lbs.per h.p.,  this would  mean  a reduction of  engine weight ol400 lbs.   The saving of fuel  is estimated by  Mr. Cockburnas .140 lbs., and the final balance becomes:-  At 133  m.p.h., 10,000 ft.  and 8 lbs. per sq.  ft.,    crew  and  commercial  load   .....................   600 lbs.At 87.5 m.p.h.  do.        do.............  600 lbs.Saving on  engine   ............  400  ,,Saving on  fuel     ............  140  ,,1,140  lbs.These  figures give 170 lbs.  and 330  lbs.  of  useful load for!each 1,000 lbs. of gross load at the speeds of  133 m,p.h.,  and?87.5 m.p.h. at 10,000 ft., and substantiate our report.  It should  be mentioned  that  experimental figures  for  alsingle aeroplane may not be representative figures  of a satis-factory kind.  For instance:-The  factor of safety may be Ilow either as part of tho design or due to  the fitting of alarger  engine than  was  originally  contemplated.   The pro- *peller may  be too light,  in which  case the  performance is higher at the risk of engine failure,  or too heavy so that thoengine cannot develop its full power.  The engine may be avery good or a very poor specimen of its class,  and a  teston  the  aeroplane may  take place in  unfavourable weather,All  these contingencies occur during  the testing of aeroplanes,and tend to confuse the issue unless fully allowed  for.   It isjthought  that our  report  is  largely  independent of. the jabove  sources of individual  error,  as  it  represents  thoresults  of observations  on  many  aeroplanes arranged  and janalysed  with   scientific  care.   Within   the   limitationsexpressly stated in the report itself  such  figures are believed:to be the best available guide to the  estimation of the per- jformance of  aeroplanes suitable  for  civil  aerial  transport.

APPENDIX B.Report  by Brig.-General  Maitland as  to  Rigid Airships.  In  endeavouring  to  formulate a similar analysis  of  thetheoretical  capabilities  of  airships the  difficulty arises  atthe outset that  airship design has not  yet  arrived  at theposition Oi being so  exact a science a.s in the case of theaeroplane.  It is therefore not possible to produce  funda-inental figures  which can  be used in making calculationsfor all sizes of  airships.   Up   to   the  present   airships   of   360,000   cf.  and2,000,000 of. capacity  of  the  non-rigid  and rigid  typesrespectively are  the largest of which there is experience inthis country,  and so little  is known of the difficulties to bemet with in any great increase  in  size in either type  thatit has  been deemed wiser  to confine these notes to a con-sideration of existing types, the details  of  which  are setforth in Table  I.   There  are, however,  as  in the  case of aeroplanes, certain factors affecting the performances of air-ship? - , ,,&apos;hich it would  appear  desirable to  consider in  some detail.  .  These are :    i (i) Liift, or  the total  amount  of weight (including  its       ,-o.wn  framework)  which  an airship of  any  given     , V  size can raise into the air,    (ii)  Height to be obtained.   (iii) Engine power.   (i) The  lift  varying  as  the  cube  of  the  dimensionsincreases very rapidly with comparatively small  increase in size, so that there are obvious advantages in having air-ships of large size.    &apos;  &apos;          -   As has already been mentioned, however, the effects oflarge increases of size from the constructional  point.of vieware comparatively unknown,  though there is  every reasonto  believe that  non-rigid  airships  of  at least 500,000 cf.capacity  and rigids of 4,000,000 cf.  are possible.   Up tothese  sizes, at  any rate,  the weight of the  hull will not increase in proportion  to  the increases in  gross  lift, andtherefore the amount of  disposable lift  available for pas-serigers,  fuel  and  merchandise  will  be  proportionatelygreater.  The lift at normal temperature and  pressure  istaken  to  be  64,4 lbs. -per&apos; 1,000 cf.  in the  case of  non-rigids and 60 lbs. in rigids.  In both cases this assumes ahydrogen  purity of  95  per cent.,  the  difference  beingaccounted for by the  fact that in a rigid airship the gas-bags  are  assumed.&quot;to be  full, while in the non-rigid theenvelope is taken  as  only 95 per cent.  full.  This is in&apos;0i&apos;der that a  certain amount of air may be in the ballonetson leaving the ground,   so  that  as  the gas  expands  onrising all  the air will be  expelled from tho ballonets  before it is necessary to release gas..  Variations  in  atmospheric  conditions  effect  very  widechanges  in  the  lifting capacity,  which may amount  to asmuch as 27 lbs. per  1,000 cf. within  the  limits of  baro-metric pressure and temperature to be met with at groundlevel.  In a rigid airship of 2,000,000 cf. this would amountto 23 tons.  In  a  present-day rigid  airship of this size with  a  grosslift of 60 tons,  about 50 per cent, of the gross lift is avail-able for &quot; disposable  freights,&quot; of  which 4,000 lbs. will betaken up by the crew, comprising :         Captain     ...............   I        First officer...............   1        Coxswain     ...............4        Engineers     ...............8        W, T. ...     ............    ...   2        Rigger        ...............1                                                -17        Doctor        ...............   1        Stewardess   ...........,    ...   1        Waitresses &apos;.........    -.....4        Cooks ...     ..:    ...    ...    ...    ...   2              - &quot;&apos;       &quot;                 &apos;        --8                                                 25.The same  amount of weight  will be  required  for  waterballast.  From the above  figures it will be seen that rather morethan  25 tons will  be available  for passengers,  fuel, andmerchandise in  existing rigid airships.  In  a  non-rigid airship  (North Sea  type)  of  360,000 cf.capacity the  percentage of the  disposable lift to the grosslift is 35  per cent.,  which  gives some  indication of theadvantages  of increased  size,  as  a non-rigid  of the samedimensions  as a  rigid airship would be  considerably superiorin this respect owing  to the absence of the hull framework.It is  in fact practically certain that it would be impossibleto design a rigid airship of 360,000 cf. capacity which  wouldlift its own weight.  (ii) It would  not appear that for commercial purposes anairship would normally  require  to go higher than  about1,000 ft., and undoubtedly for passenger-carrying purposes&apos;&apos;it would be desirable  to cruise at a height of about 500 ft.,when the passengers would be able to have a closer and moreinteresting and  pleasurable view of the surrounding country.  An airship, owing  to  the  expansion  of  the  gas, losesapproximately one-thirtieth of its  lifting power  for  every1,000 ft. above  sea-level that it rises, so that at the begin-ning of a long voyage  it would be  uneconomical to climb to a
202greater height than that given^ as gas would bo lost and  alarger quantity of ballast would have to bo carried  to com-ponsato for this loss on landing.  With 4,000 lbs. of water ballast a rigid airship of  the sizestated can rise to a height of 850 ft.  immediately on leavingtho ground and come down again at onco without being tooheavy the ballast being  sufficient to compensate for the liftlost through the release of  gas during the ascent.  On  a long voyage, as fuel is consumed during  the progressof the flight, the airship  will, of course,  bo  able to attain  agradually increasing altitude owing to her getting lighter.  On  a  short voyage  the airship, while carrying the same amount of passengers or  merchandise as on a long journey,would carry water ballast  in place  of  a proportion of thepetrol, so that she could go  to a considerable height iirvme-diately upon  starting,  from  the ground.  If, on the otherhand, it was not necessary  to go to so high  an altitude, thelift would  be taken up by extra merchandise.  On occasion it might be desirable to climb to  such heightson a long voyage in order to take advantage of  a favourablewind, which would be effected by expending  petrol as ballast.In such case it would,  of course, be  a question  for the pilotto decide  whether  the loss  of petrol would bo justified bythe resultant saving in time.  It  may  be  mentioned, as showing the heights to  whichexisting airships are capable of clinibing if necessary, thatrecently a  German rigid  airship on a special trial flightattained a height of 19,000 ft. and landed successfully atthsconclusion of the flight.  (iii)  In the case of-air airship,  increase &quot;incize can  beroadily accompanied by  increase  in speed,  as the weightinvolved by fitting more engines would occupy a very small proportion of the extra  lift, the remainder being availablefor fuel and merchandise.  In  this  connection  it  may  be pointed out that the initial weight of the power plant is offer less importance in an airship than in an aeroplane, whiletho rate of petrol consumption is of greater moment owingto the longer flights which can be  carried out.  By specialdesigning, it would therefore  be easily possible to obtain athoroughly reliable and completely silent engine for airships,whilo  the  slow running,  which would  be  a  feature of the design, would reduce vibration and give increased comfortfor passengors.   In an airship&apos; increase of speod  is merely aquestion of increase of engine  power and reduction of resist-ance.         -     v.      .    *......    -i  The power can  be distributed among  as  many units asdesired, there being no  necessity to concentrate the weightsas  must be  done in an aeroplane.  This affords an oppor-tunity of locating  tho petrol system somo distance from the engines to reduce tire danger of fire.  -  i      i  j  As  has already been pointed out, great altitudes are not necessary  for commercial airships,  but  if it were desired toclimb  rapidly, great reserve of engine power  would not berequired, as is the case with aeroplanes. &apos;                            (Signed) &quot;  E.

TABLE II.CURVES SHOWING RELATION BETWEEN  LIFT &amp; COST  OP AIROH1PS
203APPENDIX  0,Memorandum by Lieut.-Col. 0&apos;Gorman  and Mr. L.  Bairstow  as  to  the  effect  of  an            adverse  wind on  the choice of the  flight  speed  of  an  aeroplane.  1. In accordance with the wish of Committee No. 2 expressed at their second meeting, a number of further  calculations have been made for the purpose of estimating the effect of an adverse  wind on tho choice of tho flight speed of  an aero- plane.  The table now prepared has not been strictly confined to the questions asked,  but has been kept within reasonable limits.  It is far easier to give the extended  table now than to recalculate at a later period, and the scheme is in accord anco with the desire of the authors to indicate the  possibili- ties and limitations in  the general problem  rather than to work out any one lino of policy  to its full limits.  2, In  all  cases  the  aeroplane  chosen  for  example could reach a height of 10,000 ft., but no allowance  has been made for tho  extra consumption of petrol during climb.    The importance of this allowance would be greatest in the case of repeated stops, but would never affect the figures given suffi- ciently to modify any of  the conclusions.  3. As the wind contemplated was a &quot; prevailing wind &quot; it is thought that an  indication  ol&quot; the advantage of returning with the wind and the average effect on tho out and home journey is of interest as well as tho disadvantage when flying against the  wind.    The  corresponding  figures have,  there- fore, been incorporated in the table;  it  is hoped in such  a way as to leave the original  objective rpiite  conspicuous.  4. One other  point  of  general  application to the table should be noticed.  When flying with a wind  the speed over the ground and the speed through the air are no longer the same and it was necessary to decide which  would  be mostsuitable  as standard.  As the  design  is  fixed by the speedthrough the air the advantage,of using their  figures insteadof  ground speed is too obvious to  need further justification. If  desired the alternative figures  are easily  obtained fromthose given.    Hummury of aindupiiofns.   (a)  A head wind  reduces  and may reverse the  order of carrying  capacity of high speed aeroplanes as compared with low speed machines, but with an  important  reserva- tion.  In a  non-stop run of 1,000 miles, a heavily-loaded aeroplane travelling at 120 m.p.h. can carry a commercial load and crew of 122 lbs. per 1&quot;,000  lbs. of gross  load; the slow aeroplane of 80  m.p.h. can only carry  132  lbs. per 1,000,  and as  tho journey  occupies 22 hours instead of .1.2 hours in the former case the&apos; advantage of high speed is, considerable.   It is,  however,  obtained by  the use of a high loading which entails a landing speed of 58 m.p.h. or more  for the high speed  machine as against 45 m.p.h. or more for  the slow  machine.  The importance  of  this reservation will lie clear from Column 13, which shows that a  reduction of the loading  of tho  high  speed aeroplane&apos; to 6 lbs.  per  ,sq.  ft, would  lead to a  total  loss  of  com- mcrcial load.  The effect of wind in  prolonging the length of journey through the a in has been  sufficient to annul the reserve; of 128 lbs. per 1,000 lbs.,  which  was  shown  in Table III. of  the  original paper which was clearly stated related to still  air only.   (b) The advantage of a single stop during  which petrol can be replaced  is very great,  as may be  seen by  a  corn- par ison of the figures  in. any of tho columns.   Half the weight of petrol  for the whole journey  is converted into useful load, and additional stops, however numerous, can- not lead  to a  further saving  of the same magnitude.   For five stops the figures are given in the table.  With one stop in a 1,000-miles  journey, machines of all the flight speeds contemplated  leave a valuable margin for crew and  com- niercial  load, the  slow  or heavily-loaded  high-speed aero- plaiies  still retaining an appreciable advantage  over the light high-speed  machine.   (c) The average load carried  on  the &quot; out  and home &quot; journeys  in a  wind of 35 m.p.h.  is a little less than  that for no  wind.   The figures given  for the average load are obtained  by taking an arithmetical mean of the figures for flight in  a head wind  of 35 m.p.h.,  and in a  following wind of  35  m.p.h.

After 36 hours&apos; flight one will have  consumed:-    36     700  25,200 lbs. of fuel, and will  therefore (her gross lift being.134,400  lbs.)  be in static equilibrium at a height  of25,200 x 30                                  h- =  5,600 ft. 134,400She has sufficient water  ballast for a  further rise of 3,000 ft.,and  therefore can surmount a mountain of 8,000 ft.

Note.-These figures are assuming that the airship  climbed statically to surmount  the  mountain.  In point of  fact  she would probably climb by means of her elevators and rely upon the consumption of fuel to avoid being too heavy on landing. To be on  the safe side, however, she would probably carry sufficient water  ballast for a rise of 6,000 ft.  when the figures would be:               Fuel for 40  hours............  28,000 lbs.

In this case she would require to consume fuel equivalent to a rise of 2,000 ft. (8,000 - 6,000 ft.) before she could land without releasing petrol as ballast.   This would be after .12.8 hours&apos; flight beyond the mountain or 420  miles from the starting  point. II. With  one stop.

The water ballast, plus four hours&apos;  fuel consumed, will enable the airship  to rise 7,350 ft.  She will &quot; plane &quot; thi rest  of the  height and be able  to  land in equilibrium  at tht end of the stage owing to the consumption of the  remaining four hours&apos;  fuel.

An express air service  on such a route,  therefore, ever                                                            if it could cut down the time by an hour or so, as compared                                                            with the transit by train, would only  be offering a business                                                            man a slightly additional convenience. He  might, indeed,  It is assumed that, in an experimental  service, started im-mediately after the war, only  a limited quantity of expressmails would be carried, at a fee determined by the Post Office,and that the bulk of the mails will still go, as at present,  byland.  A  London-Glasgow route has been chosen  for illustrationfor several reasons.  In the first  place,  it requires at least athree hours&apos; flight, at an average, say,  of 100 miles an hour,such as that from London to Newcastle, for the speed  of  an air  service to  reveal itself and for this speed to offer a sufficiently marked saving  of  time  over  railway  transit,
204  ay that so long as his &quot;  express &quot; letter reached its destina-  Jjori in time to he dealt with before  the office to which it was lidchessed  closed for  tho  day that he was satisfied,  and was Indifferent whether the letter was delivered,  say, at 2.30 p.ni. for 3.30 p.m.   But in  the case  of a city like Newcastle, or facilities  farther North,  it is not  possiblo to &quot;  express &quot; letters Ijn the morning in London, at any hour which might bo con- lidered reasonable for business purposes, and for these letters fto reach such cities by train in  time to be dealt with beforeJthc close of the business  day.  Therefore, by  instituting  a london-NeAvcastle-Edinburgh-Glasgow   servico,   and  by  so $arranging  this service that a business man could post a letter  in the morning in London or Glasgow, and for  this letter to (reach  its destination before tho close of the business day, one hvould offer  the business  world  a very  clear facility,  which [cannot be  offered by any existing means of transit. I  The  use is  assumed&apos; of  an   aeroplane which,  carrying  1,000 lbs. of mails, will maintain  an average speed of 100 miles  an hour.   it is very  necessary to consider  the time occupied in estab-  lishing the land communications of an air service.  Letters  must be carried from the city  to the aerodrome, and then, at  the other end,  from the aerodrome to the city.   In  the period immediately  following the  war,  Hendon will,  it may be assumed,  be the  London terminal  aerodrome  for  mail services.   It  is assumed,  also,   that  mails  will  be carried between  the  G.P.O. and the aerodrome in motor vans. In  a year or eighteen months after the war  the Post Office will it is hoped, have in operation a miniature electric underground railway, carrying mails from East to West  of  London, and vice versa, at a maximum speed  of  35 miles an hour.  An extension of this railway from Mount Pleasant to the Hendon Aerodrome would enable mails to be carried  from the G.P.O. to Hendon in about a quarter of an hour.  In  the provisional  time  table  which  is submitted  for  a London-Glasgow service,  three-quarters-of-an-hour has  been allowed for-each land connection and distribution of letters, its made by motor vans or motor cycles. PROVISIONAL TIME  TABLE:  London-Glasgow,  Glasgow-                          London.                One machine s&apos;.ach  way  daily.                   LONDON-GLASGOW.  Posting is allowed at the G.P.O.  up to 10.30 a.m,, when the mail-bags are closed, and  carried to Hendon  in  a motor-van. The time table is then as follows :     11.15 to 2.15. Carriage of the mails by air from Hendon        to Newcastle.   The distance  in  a straight  line is        about 250 miles: but an allowance is made for slight        deviations  on  the part  of the pilot, while  a three        hours&apos; flight has  been  assumed  for  the  convenience        of  obtaining  a round  figure.   In  actual  working,        however, taking  the average  speed  throughout  at        100 miles  an  hour, the journey should  be  accom-        plished  in  a  little  less  than three hours.   But,  as        against this, may  be set such small losses of time, in        the actual  operation of  a service, as cannot  be cal-        culated in  advance. The aeroplane does not alight        at Newcastle, but drops  the Newcastle mail in a net,        and continues its  flight.   The Newcastle mail is then        carried  into  the city, and may be assumed  to have        been distributed  by 3 o&apos;clock.  It might be found        necessary in  actual working to descend  at Newcastle        to  pick up  letters which Newcastle  firms desired  to        send by air to Glasgow.    2.15  to 3.15. The aeroplane continues its flight to Edin-        burgh.  It does not stop at Edinburgh, the mail-bag        for that city being dropped into a net, and the letters        delivered by four  o&apos;clock.    3.15  to 3.45. The aeroplane completes its last  stage  to        Glasgow.    3.45  to 4.30. Glasgow mail carried  into  the city and        distributed.                   GLASGOW-LONDON.  Posting is  allowed in  Glasgow  up to 10.30  a.m.  Then  themail-bags are closed and taken to  tho  aerodrome.  The time-table is then as follows :--     11.15 to 11.45. The aeroplane  flies from Glasgow  to Edin-        burgh,  alighting to pick  up mails for Newcastlo or        London. It might also, if  thero were any, carry mails        from  Glasgow to Edinburgh,    11.50 to 12.50. The aeroplane continues  its journey to        Newcastle, where  it  alights to unload  and  also to        pick up.   &apos;i:l2.55 to 3.55. The  aeroplane continues  its  flight  from        Newcastle  to Hendon,    3.55 to 4.40. The London mail is carried from  Hendon        into the city  and distributed.  It may be  useful to  give an illustration  of the facilities offered by such an air-mail  service  as that  described :   The  Newcastle  recipient  of a  letter, say,  from  London,after acquainting himself with its  contents, might be able, insome cases to answer  immediately by  telegram or telephone,or he  might  prefer  to  write  a more  detailed answer whichwould  go back  to  London in the ordinary way by  eveningmail, being received in  London the next  morning.   If the recipient of the letter adopted the last-mentioned course, thoair-mail being used only one way,  there would  still be a  clearsaving in time of a  day, as compared with the existing routineof correspondence this routine being for a letter to be postedin the  evening in London, received in Newcastle the  next morning, tho answer being written  and posted that day, reach-ing London  on the  third morning.  .  By courtesy of the  Post  Office,  it is possible to  state thatat the  present time, reckoning the mails dispatched  bothWAYS, a total of approximately 200,000 letters and postcardsare carried  during a   period  of 24 hours  between London,Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.  Could it be assumed that each  individual  posting represented  a  letter  weighing  anounce,  then  it would be possible to state that, if approximatelyan  eighth of this  existing  volume  of  mail traffic could  botransferred  to the  air,  there  would be  sufficient  to  fill one machine each way a day reckoning each  machine to carry a 1,000 lbs.  load.   But  it is the  custom  of the Post Officeto place letters and  postcards under one heading, and separatefigures are not obtainable.  As to  the financial aspect of the London-Glasgow air service,adopting Mr. Holt Thomas&apos;s  figure of 4s. 8d. per mile for overhead charges and running costsf, the daily expenses of acontractor, operating  one machine each way, would be roughly 198.  As against this,  at  a full  load both ways (a  total of32,000  ounces), the contractor^ charge for  carriage, to coverhis  bare expenses, would be almost exactly 14/1. per ounce.Assuming an express service, with a  charge to the public of4d.  or  fid.  per ounce, for a fair proportion of letters drawn from the total of 260,000 letters and postcards which has been mentioned  in  the  paragraph  above,  it  would  appear that,on a contract of carriage the.  Post Office could well  pay the contractor a sum which would not only cover his bare expenses,but show  a  considerable profit in working.                                           HARRY HARPER.  10th  September, 1917.  * Newcastle firms wishing to send a letter by air to London would  be  able to post up to as late as  12.10 p.m.   This would allow firms in cities near by, such as Gateshead,  Sunderland and South  Shields, to catch the  air mail for London by sending  in their letters to Newcastle by train;  or an  aeroplane might  visit these neighbouring districts during the morning, collecting letters for London, which it would bring to the  Newcastle aerodrome in time to catch  the London machine.   Such  a  system  feeding the main route might be adopted  also IN other  localities.  T  This estimate of 4s. 8d. per mile is worked out  by Mr.  Holt Thomas in his paper  read before the Aeronautical  Society  of Great  Britain on May 30, 1917, relating to   an  aerial   service between London  and Paris. The figure of 4s.  8d.  is  based on the assumption of  a service by one machine each way daily, and it is thought that a FAIT analogy  can be  drawn between the  London- Paris service  and  that  outlined  in the present memorandum. Without in  any way  criticising  Mr. Holt Thomas&apos;s figures, it would appear that they rest on what  may be called a conservative basis, and  that, therefore, the expenses in the  present  instance are not  estimated at too low  a figure.

(a)  Two  aircraft meeting each other end  on, and &quot;therebyrunning  tho risk of  a  collision,  must always steer  to  theright.  They must, in  addition to  this,  pass  at a distance ofat least 100*  metres,  taken between their  nearest adjacentpoints.                                   &apos;  (b)  Any aircraft overtaking another aircraft is responsiblefor keeping clear, and must not approach within 100  metreson tho right or  300 metres on the left of the overtaken air-craft, and must not  pass directly  underneath or over suchovertaken aircraft.  The distance shall be  taken between  the  nearest adjacentpoints of tho respective  aircraft.  In no case must the over-taking aircraft turn in across the  bows of the other aircraftafter  passing  it  so as to. foul it  in  any way.  (c)  When  any  aircraft are approaching  one another  incross  directions, then the aircraft that  sees  another aircraft on its right-hand forward quadrantj must give way, and  theother aircraft must keep on its course  at the same level  tillboth are well clear.Flying Grounds.  Tho  following  Special  Regulations  apply  only  to  Hyinggrounds:    (d)  Two  aircraft meeting each other  end  on, and therebyrunning the risk of a collision, must always steer to tho rightThey  must, in addition to this, pass at  a  distance of^ at least30 metres taken between their  nearest adjacent points.  (e)  Any aircraft overtaking another aircraft is responsiblefor keeping clear,  and in no caso must  turn in  across thebows  of the other  aircraft after passing  it, so as to foul itor risk a collision, and must, in addition,  subject to Rule 12,conform to the  following regulations:    (1)  If Hying on the same level, i.e., within 5 metres aboveor below,  must  pass  outside  the overtaken aircraft at notless than  10  metres.  (2)  If  on  a  different level,  must not pass  nearer  than10  metres.  The distance shall be taken between  tho nearest  adjacentpoints of  tho respective aircraft.  An  aircraft when being overtaken shall  not alter its courseor level, save when in  the  act of  overtaking  and passinganother aircraft.      PLYING TO THE BANGER OF  THE PUBLIC. (Passed by  tho Committee Nov. II, 1913.)  1. Flying to the danger of tho public  is prohibited;  par-ticularly, unnecessary flights  over towns or thickly-populated areas, or over places where crowds aro temporarily assembled,or over public enclosures at aerodromes at such a height asto involve  danger to the public.  2. Flying is also  prohibited over river regattas, race meet-ings,  meetings for public  games and sports, except flightsspecifically arranged for  in  writing with the promoters cfsuch  regattas,  meetings,  etc.  In the case of dirigibles the distance of  100 metres prescribed above shall be increased to 500 metres.t From 0 degrees (i.e., straight ahead) to 90 degrees on the right hand constitutes the forward quadrant.                           APPENDIX G.Report  on Weather Service  for  Aerial   Transport.  The chief meteorological requirements for the guidance of aerial Transport may be divided into three groups :-.    (1)  Statistical information.    (2)  Forecasts.    (3)  Knowledge  of the  momentary  meteorological condi-        tions along aerial  routes.(1)  Statistical informatiom,  Most  of  the  meteorological  information  at  present  inexistence is in the hands of the Meteorological Office or canbe obtained by them.  Statistical information would  be useful for such purposes has choosing routes and  the sites for aerodromes and build-ihgs, .  The statistical  information at  present  obtainabledifferentiates between areas of  50  or 100 miles square; forinstance,  between the meteorological  conditions  which are met with on opposite sides of a mountain chain.  But thereis as  yet little information relating to  the local  variations in meteorological conditions.  Statistics already collected are available  for determiningsuch questions as whether it is  better  to leave Switzerlandon the port or starboard hand in flying to Italy, or whetherit would pay to  go round southwards by the Azores in flyingto America. On the other hand, the statistical information at present available is not capable of discriminating betweenthe average meteorological conditions  of  two alternativesites for aerodromes situated within a few miles, or even 20or 30 miles,  of  one another, except in so far as it shows which of the meteorological conditions  are likely to be the same intwo neighbouring sites.  Statistics show, for instance,  thatthe cloudiness and rainfall in two neighbouring sites  maybe the same unless  special circumstances interfere.  On theother hand, fogginess and windiness  depend almost exclu-sively on  such local  conditions  that the present  statisticsare, of  little uso except   for  tho  actual station  at whichobservations were made.   Perhaps, later,  aerodromes willaccumulate  their own data.  A small staff at tho Meteorological Office would collect theavailable useful  information, but  such  a  staff would  haveto be directed by  someone in  touch  with  aeronautics,  inorder that the information might be collected and tabulatedin the form most useful for flying.  He would have to decidesuch questions as whether  frequencies or mean values shouldbe dealt with,  In dealing  with wind statistics, for instance,it is more useful to know  the number of hours during which certain  winds blow with  certain strengths,  and  from thovarious directions, than it  is to know the mean wind velocityor direction.  If weather stations are going to be established at terminaland intermediate aerodromes in connection with  civil aerialtransport, it will be necessary to overhaul thoroughly thecharacter of observations taken, in order that special atten-tion may be paid to the data which are most important.  It is advisable that a system should be organised by whichobservations are taken and recorded regularly by aeroplanestravelling on  defined routes.  Tho work  of collecting andcomparing these statistics,  and  the   superintendence  ofinstruments  might  be undertaken  -by  the meteorological office. ...  It has been  pointed out  by various members of the Com-mittee that civil aerial  transport will  inevitably  have  tobe worked on international lines.  It is impossible to fore-cast  what measure  of  international co-operation  will  bepossible  after  the war, but it may be pointed out  that formany years previous  to the war the  International Meteoro-logioal Committee has done successful  work in organisinginternational  exchange  of meteorological information and international  co-operation  in meteorological research.   Itseems certain that it  would be advisable to consult with theaerial transport authorities in the  allied countries  before deciding  on any definite  plans  for a weather  service foraerial transport.(2)  Forecasting.  An extension of  the present  system in operation at the meteorological  Office  should provide everything that can beexpected  in the present state of our meteorological know-ledge.  The high average  correctness of weather  forecastswill doubtless be improved.  Present system, The present system involves taking obsei&apos;-vations at certain places two or three times a day, and com-communicating  by telegraph with a  Central  Office, where the weather  maps are made and yio forecosts  issued.  forecasts for 12 or 24 hours ahead at two or three fixed hours shouldbe telegraphed  from  the Central  Office  to the termini and intermediate aerodromes.Directions in which present system could be extended.  1. Extension  of range covered. Weather telegrams arealready  obtained from  a   few  distant  places,  as  Iceland./Cairo, and the Azores,  and from  ships by wiireless.   Thenumber of distant stations could bo increased and the rangeextended so as  to include Russia,  the Balkans,  North  africa and America.   Before the war the observations sent  by wire-less  from ships usually arrived too late to be  used  in the forecasts, but  the growing importance of messages from the atlantic in  connection with  aerial transport  will  make it                                           APPENDIX  F,Rules  of  the  Air,  as  passed  by  the  Committee  of  the  Royal  Aero  Club.
205  worth whilo  to organise thoso reports  in  such a  \v,iy that  tho messages arrivo in time.   For this purpose  fuller co-  operation with tho  Royal&apos; Navy and tho Mercantile  Marine  should he sought.   By increasing in this way tho number of data on which  forecasts tare based, it will be possible to  increase tho size  of tho region for which tho  forecast is issued and to make it  more accurate in all ways.   2. Extension in  the  number of  weather conditions pre-  DIDED. At present tho forecasts aro adapted to  tho needsI  of people on tho ground or  the sea-sailors, farmers, travol-I  trawlers, etc.  They might be much more useful to flying men if  they were made to  include tho heights  at  which  clouds aro  to bo expected, and the velocity  and direction of the upper  winds.   The first  of these has &quot;not yet been attempted, but  as tho data furnished  by aeroplanes become more  numerous  such forecasts may become accurate and  useful.  The second,  tho forecasting of wind at various heights,  has already been  practised  successfully   in  France by  the  Meteorological  Section  there, and there is  no reason why it should not be  carried  out  even  more successfully over a  wider  range by  the Meteorological Office.   Such  forecasts  would  be facilitated  by increasing the  number  of upper air observations and of  thoso on mountains.  (3)  Knowledge of  the momentary weather.   For this purpose  the  present system is quite inadequate  A continuous weather  servico would  be  necessary.   All  landing  grounds would evidently  be suitable weather obser-  vation stations, and continuous readings and reports could  bo arranged for, if necessary.   In distributing  information two systems could be used.  Father tho observations could bo  communicated at frequent-intervals, say, every hour, itq a  Central Office, and could  then :bo telegraphed or telephoned when required to aero-  dromes,   or  the  observations  could  be taken  only when  required and telephoned direct to the termini.   The advantage  of the Central Office is that it would have  a more  comprehensive view of the weather conditions over  the whole of Europe,  and, moreover,  an  expert could  bo  kept at  the Central  Office who would have the present eondi-  tions at  his fingers&apos; ends, and  would know which were liable  to a sudden change.   The chief  difficulty which is likely to bo experienced in  this  branch of the weather servico is that of communicating the observations sufficiently quickly to the termini.  It seems probable that the direct method would be quicker than  tho control Office method.  Another  point  in favour of direct communication is that the observations taken at an inter- mediate landing-ground aro only immediately interesting to the termini of the route on which it lies.  These two points appear  to  us to  outweigh the advantages of  the  Central Office method.   If. there  is a  direct telephone wire  along tho route  or constant  wireless communication,  the   whole  problem  is greatly simplified,  On the other hand, if tho ordinary tele- phone lines have to bo used, some sort of  priority &apos;for weather messages will have to bo arranged if they aro to be  of any real use. &apos;  The type of observations which could usefully be taken at the intermediate landing grounds needs  some  consideration. The height of the clouds is one of the most important things for a pilot to know.   It would not be difficult to fit a  range- finder which would givo the height of tho clouds at a glance.   The velocity and direction of  tho  wind at various  heights is also important, but it needs a skilled observer to make a pilot-balloon ascent, &apos;and even then the information  is not available  for about  three-quarters of  an hour after tho balloon  is sent off.   It seems hardly possiblo to use pilot- balloons in  connection with this  branch of the weatherservice,  unless balloons are sent up at regular intervals  of two or threo hours,  and the  last result  is communicated  in response to any enquiry from a terminus.   On  the other hand, on ia clear day tho upper wind at any particular height would bo found in a  few seconds by means of a smoke-shell fired vertically and timed so as to explode at tho right height.   One of the chief functions of the observer at the landing- grounds would be to  report the appearance and disappear- anco  of fog on their  own aerodrome.  This needs no very special training,  but  trained and experienced observers will bo needed at every   important  aerodrome where upper-air work  is carried out, and also  at places from which local  or general forecasts  are issued.   A corps of such observers should form an  integral part of  the military  or civil  air services, as, in fact, they already  form a part of the Royal Naval Air Servico.                                 MONTAGU.             ;C   21/8/17.              -.      G. I.  TAYLOR  (Major)APPENDIX  H.Preliminary Memorandum  on  Inter-communication  between  Aircraft  and  the  Ground,               and  also  Inter-communication between Aircraft  and  Aircraft -  1. The nature of the wireless installation  will be governed by the type and capacity of the  machine.   2. Aeroplanes whose size prohibits the carrying of a special wireless operator can be fitted with  very simple apparatus operated by a pilot,  who need know nothing more than how to send good Morse  at 20 words  a  minute.   This apparatus should weigh about  30 lbs., and have a  range of about  50 miles.   3. The use to which this  could bo  put would bo:           (a) Weather  information.         (b) Warning of approach to aerodrome.         (c) The sending out of S.O.S. signals.   4. If  it is  considered  necessary  for  the same  type  of machine  to be able to transmit over  longer distances up  to about 150 miles,  a simple  form  of continuous wave trans- mitter could  be provided, which any  pilot would learn very quickly.   5. The above represents nearly the limit of  what can  be (lone when tho pilot  has no assistance.  When the machino is of sufficient size to carry  an operator,  the possibilities  of wireless become greatly increased.   0. In the latter case,  a much more powerful and  efficient transmitter, and also apparatus for reception would  be pro- vided.  With instruments at present available,  it is  possiblo to maintain communication over a distance of 400-500 miles, and to receive signals from the  ground  150 miles away.   7. In  addition to  the  three uses mentioned in para.  3, tho station would be  open for  the uso  of passengers,  and for tho transaction of  such work as is at present carried on by an ordinary ship station.  Press and time signals and weather reports would be received  from the  Eiffel  Tower probably anywhere within 1,000  miles of that  station.   8. Directional wireless will probably be one of the greatest aids to safe navigation,  and  may  be considered from  two^iew points,  (a) that  in which  the&apos;whereabouts  of a  machineSort be ascertained  by the intersection of two bearings of its signals taken by two suitably-disposed ground  stations,  and signalled  back to the  machine; (b) that in  whicb the machino. itself  can  ascertain  the bearing of  a signal  sent  from  a station on the ground.   9. The  first of these  problems is  already solved, tho only difficulty  lies  in getting tho  information from the ground  to the  machine.  This, of course,  depends upon the efficiency of reception in tho  machine.  The ground stations should lio as far as possible at right angles to  the course of  flight,. in order to take advantage of as great  a  difference of bearing as possible&apos;, and  to provide  a long base line.  They should bo 300-100 miles apart.  10. The second problem is  engaging serious  attention,  and the  experiment promises well.   This solution will probably bo the  moro practical one  for  navigation, as  the machino having  its radio-goniometer on  board  will be able to steer from station  to  station  by  this  means,  or  to take their bearings.  11. Great  stress  has been  laid  upon the  importance ofweather  reporting.   This can  be  Teadily accomplished by:-     (a)  Machines under way reporting their position and tho  state  of the weather periodically;                 -     (b)  By having special machines at chosen  positions to go  up periodically   and   report  weather  conditions  from  different heights.  The collection of these reports  at a central  station should prove useful  in giving the state of the atmosphere  over a considerable  area  and. at different heights.  12. Iriter-communication  between  machines  can only be carried out at present over such distances as 10 15 miles,  and will  probably not be of much use.  13. As to future developments, apart from the increase.inrange and efficiency of instruments, wireless telephony may prove a useful  accessory, as also the visual  reception of wire- less signals.   Both of these have been  considerably developed, and  work over about half tho distance at  which Morse  sig- nalling  can be carried on.  14. The use of wireless is subject to many restrictions^  andsuch questions  as power, wave length,  decrement and coup- ling  will be laid   down, by the Government Department responsible for such matters.  15. These remarks are only intended to  show roughly  thocapabilities of  wireless  in  aircraft, and to suggest some ofthe uses  to which it can bo put.

Safety  Appliances  for  Commercial Aircraft.  1. Tho risk of forced lauding of aeroplanes is the first ofall  risks run, and for this two  remedial possibilities  exist.Tho most important expenditure on safety and on the generaleconomy of  aerial transport is  the provision of  alightinggrounds along the flying routes,  and no suggestion herein is put forward in  substitution  for, or in  diminution  off theimportance of these route-alighting grounds; the second is theextension of the use of multi-engined  aeroplanes.  Airshipswould  usually  bo provided with  more  than  one engine inany case.  2. In considering the detail of appliances  to be used inconnection  with safety on  aircraft, regard must  be  hudboth to the prevention of  accidents and the best method ofdealing  with  tho  dangers  arising  after  accidents  have occurred, whether on the ground before commencing a flight,in the air, or on landing.   It must bo realised that experience shows that an accident to  the machine by no means involves,in  the  majority  of  cases,  an   accident  to the  flyer  and passenger.   It.is probably  that the civil  use of aircraft willconduce  to  much greater  safety than  the Useful standardalready reached, quite apart from any appliances-especially since  extreme  war  performance  and manceuvring are  notcalled for.  3.  Fire. The direction  in  which study is advisable;  in all types of aircraft  is to try to arrange  for  the  main petrolsupply to be situated clear of the hot  parts of the engineand away  from the magneto, and to see  that the  exhaustpipes are kept clear of the petrol  pipes,  and the exhaust dis-eharge is in such a position that a spark cannot ignite any surplus petrol  flowing away  in  the case  of  over-filling of tanks, or any vapour from  exits or leakages.  In some enginesgauze boxes can be fitted  to  induction  pipes, and tho  inletducts to carburettors arranged to draw  the air from outsidethe structure.  4. Experiments have been  made on  magnetos by  makingsmall alterations to enable  them to be immersed in an inflamatory-mable  vapour,  and it has been  found  that  after  loweringand raising the pressure on such  vapour it did not fire themixture  even when overflow  sparks  occurred at the safetygap.  This preliminary study should be prosecuted, and could probably result in the general introduction  of such magnetos.Meanwhile the whole petrol system is kept clear of electricaldevices, such as magnetos and wireless,  in case leakages of petrol should give rise to vapour in their vicinity. A desirablefeature which has been suggested as useful is an arrangement for shutting off the petrol from the jet  instantly.    this might take  the  form of a spring-controlled  mechanism acting on  a needle fitted  with  a  quick  thread,  which, through thoaction of a  spring, could be made to stop up  the jet orifice.The object, which is  to ensure the  engine stopping quicklywhen desired,  could be effected  in  various ways, and herealso is  a field  for  experimental  development.  Incidentallythis might avoid the danger of an engine running backwardsif overheated.  5. All overflow pipes  and  pipes between  the carburettorand the atmosphere are led well  outboard,  and care  is takenin the making of exhaust manifold joints to avoid the dangerof  their blowing out.  In  the case of rotary  engines,  whichusually have no exhaust pipes, it is  usual to cowl them com-pletely with metal cowls and  to keep those supporting  mem-bers which  may come  near the exhaust free from  exposedinflammable material.  Any fuel  or oil  that may be thrown out from the engine is kept within the cowl, and if it shouldcatch fire no damage results.  Nevertheless  such cowls shouldbe  drained.- The aircraft  of to-day have, except in  the caseof  airships only, small margin  of  useful  load, and  theirutility is jeopardised by  compulsory carrying of  additionalweights;  Hence fire  extinguishers do not form an ohliga-tory  equipment  until  the  aeroplane   attains considerabledimensions, but it is eminently desirable that they should becarried if possible.  Small extinguishers should be available at  all aerodromes, but they must not contain ingredientslikely to harm fabric or wood work.  6. Pararhvt.es.-In  airships,  kite balloons,  and  balloons,the use  of  these, though  requiring decision and courage onthe part of the user, does not offer the same difficulties asin  the  case of aeroplanes.  It is, however,  in the present stage  of  development inadvisable to  jump in a parachuteunder a^ height of about 500 ft.   As regards aeroplanes.opinion is divided as to the  advisability of employing  para-chutes,  both for the above reasons and hecause there is diffi-culty in fixing the parachute in such a position that no part ofthe aeroplane will be fouled when tho jump is taken.  More. Iover,  a substantial  proportion of the accidents which  occuronly become accidents after tho ground has been reached,, ortoo nearly  approached  or  the  parachute to be useful.  Thebest position for a parachute would seem to be either on theunderside or on the  side of the  body, and  a  comparativelyflat and  compact parachute  case has already  been designed for this,  and has been successfully employed in  experimentalflights with airships.  It may be said that parachutes would only be employed inthe case  of a serious outbreak of fire,  or the breakage of somevital  part  of  the  machine.   in the  latter case it would generally be problematical  whether  the  parachute could bogot free-in the former,  the problem of fire is best  dealt withby  preventive  measures.   Meanwhile  the carrying out ofexperiments is to  be encouraged.  7. Air  or Land Bmkes. -These have  a distinct promise ofutility for  landing in restricted areas.   Several forms of airbrake  have already been tried  with more or less success.  Aisoon as engines have reached a high standard of reliableness a promising  fo&apos;rm of air brake-is the variable pitch and rever-sible air-screw.  Land brakes might take tho form of a plougheither  operated by hand  or automatically  making contact with the  ground.   A similar purpose would be served by wingsof variable surface or with the  camber and angle of incidencecapable  of  being  altered.    This latter  development might come with  the further increase  of flying speeds  which is oftenforeshadowed.  8. Instrument for Ascertaining the Attitude of an  Aeroplaiuin a Cloud. It is  understood that considerable importance isattached to this by  pilots.  Neither the ordinary  spring-con-trolled air  speed indicator nor the spirit level can be  relied upon for this purpose.   Only a gravity-controlled  instrumentgives for steady flight conditions the true angle of incidenceirrespective of whether  the  machine is turning or not. Ithas been suggested  that, but for the extreme  weight of thegyrostat, a solution  might  be found in its adoption, the pilotputting his machine  in a horizontal position before entering the cloud  and starting  the  gyrostat, which would continueto indicate the direction  in which the  axis of the machinewas lying  at  the  instant  of release.  More important  than this is the  indication of  turning, an instrument which  showswhether  a  turn is or is  not being made.   This relieves us ofthe evil  results of  certain peculiarities of the  aero compass.  9. Lauding at Night. Landing airships at night does not present any great  difficulty.  The best method has been  foundto be  to  place beacon lights on the sheds -with a searchlighton  the ground pointing up-wind, coupled with steaming lights.The trail rope is  also painted white.  Some similar system,or  petrol  or acetylene  flares, is suggested for aeroplanes,perhaps  coupled  with  carrying on  the  machine a search-light  and  parachute flares, to illuminate the  ground in theevent  of a forced  landing.  10.  Navigation  in  Fog. This is in part a question of illu-minating arrangements,  as, generally speaking, the fog hardlyever extends beyond  2,000 ft. from the  ground, and is purely local.  The system adopted in  France of firing star shells toburst  over the fog might also be developed along commercialroutes.  Landing grounds should be selected as far as possiblein  fogless  areas,  and perhaps advantage for alighting  might result from specially treating the ground to keep  a dry sur-face.  Research and experiment on the dispersal of fog wouldalso be valifable.  11.  Multiplication  of Power Plant in Aeroplanes. This liasobvious  merits in  large  machines as  a guarantee against theresults of  engine  failure.   Three engines have some advan-tage over  two.  Four-engined machines  with  one tractor engine on eachwing,  and behind it, a pusher  engine with the crank-shaft inthe same line,  have been tried  and promise well, though theyhave not yet been fully  tried  out.   As  a  matter ef  useful information required on this classof  work  it may be said  that it has been found that in  twin-engined  machines it is not necessary  to have opposite-handedengines, but  that  a machine can be flown quite successfullywith two  right-handed  or two-left-handed engines.  This isan important  simplification for the  upkeep  of such craft.                                E.  M.

Report  by  Lieut,-Colonel  0&apos;Gorman,  Mr.  Holt  Thomas,  and  Mr.   Lanchester                           on  a  Main  or  Terminal  Aerodrome,  NOTE. This report was drawn up in answer to a request by the Special  Committee  for  a report upon a main  orterminal aerodrome suitable for despatching and receivinglOO aeroplanes a day, with sufficient housing accommodation for a similar number.             A Main or Terminal Aerodrome.  Wo do not consider that it  is possible to make any  con-structive report on this subject on the lines of 100 aeroplanesleaving and arriving per day and housing for 100 craft.1. Expenditure.  The cost  of terminal aerodromes is by no means so easilyapproximated to as that of  intermediate  grounds,  for thereason that they will necessarily be at least on the outskirts of large centres of population.  It is accordingly impossibleto make any estimato of what expenditure might bo involved.(It  may  be possible to  discover what  is  the  approximateground-rent of Hendon Aerodrome, also its accurate  acreage(approximately 200 acres), and to indicate whether such an aerodrome as this is tho minimum which could be reasonablyused for civil transport  service in London, and whether  itmay be  regarded  as a  minimum  type of  terminal aero-dromes.)2. Size.  The minimum sine of an aerodrome from the point of viewof the alighting of  single machines,  is obviously  the size  ofthe   intermediate  landing  grounds  indicated by  CaptainRobb in his paragraph 2 of Appendix K, but the  actual sizerequired  at any terminal station for,  e.g.,  100  aeroplanes&quot; leaving and arriving &quot;  per day depends  upon tho  numberof aeroplanes  which may be  expected to be arriving  orleaving simultaneously,  and it is difficult  to  forecast  this with any attempt at precision,  since no  data exists on which to found an estimate of tho times of starting and arriving.If we suppose that  aeroplane flying  will for preference takeplace by  daylight, then it is to be supposed that the major part of the starting will take place  in the morning  and the major part  of the arriving will take place  after noon, sinceon broad  lines it may be said that the reasonably long flightswill be economically desirable.   Nevertheless, where the airsorvice is run to districts which have not got a good railwayservice,  it  will be  found that short distance air journeyscan be introduced, and accordingly a certain amount of useof the aerodrome  throughout the middle hours of  the day for  leaving and arriving  is to  be expected.  Under  the cir-cumstances, it is impossible to discuss the problem on a basisof a definite number per diem without making some  assump-tion for which data clo not at present exist; we have there-fore substituted  the rate per hour and assumed 15 leavingsor arrivals  per hour, without expressing our  opinion as  towhether this corresponds to 100 per diem. It is thought  thatan  aerodrome  of  about 200 acres could handle this traffic,especially if the departures were reasonably distinct fromthe  bulk of tho  arrivals, but for it to do so it would  benecessary to have active and  well organised gangs of  mento arrange to  clear the  aerodrome  of machines which  may-stop in aji  exposed position, and thus  leave the aerodromefree for other  machines.  Compulsory powers of purchase  orhiring in default of agreement will no doubt be necessary  insome centres.3. Surface.  In view of the extreme importance to bo attached to highwing  loading  and  rapid alighting,  for tho  purpose  of economy in aircraft construction and use,  the surface of the aerodrome would have to be  very much superior to that atpresent existing  at Hendon,  without actually pressing it tothe point of  being as level  as an ordinary  cricket field.Beyond that it would be imperative that all high buildingshigh hedges  and high trees in the immediate neighbourhoodshould as far as possible be avoided.4. Soil.  It is clear from experience up to date of  aerodromes, whichare frequently  on flat, low-lying Iand:  that drainage wouldbe required.  Moreover,  on  a certain expanse  in front ofthe sheds proposed, there should be tar macadam or otherwaterproof inexpensive flooring.5. Appi&apos;mches.  These should  be similar to those mentioned in paragraph 5of Appendix If.6. Surrounding Country.  See Appendix K, paragraph 6.7. Preparations.  See Appendix K, paragraph 7, save that  since the terminalgrounds  will be  larger they  will  be proportionately more costly.8. Accommodation.  The  housing for,  say,  100 aeroplanes  would  necessarily involved petrol and oil stores, repair departments, standingbuildings for ground-men, offices, store  for the reception and delivery  of  goods, and, later, station  room,  perhaps, for passengers,  garages for attendant  motor-cars to  convey theservice to town  centres,  offices for inspectors  and trafficchiefs, etc., and aeroplane sheds  so built as to admit thelargest probable aeroplanes.  At the inception of the service on a small scale this expense could no  doubt be  deferred orminimised.9. Marking.  It is probable  that no  specific marking will  be requiredfor terminal landing grounds,  because their character willbo so very obvious to fliers who are approaching the centre for  which  they  are  making,  but  arrangements  for  suchdevices as kite balloons for signalling  the situation in timeof fog, wireless appliances and meteorological  observatoryshould be foreseen.10. Lighting.  Paragraph 11 re lighting in Appendix K would also applyhere.11. Maintenance.  See paragraph 12 of Appendix K.  The  installation of housing  for 100  aeroplanes on trans-port work at the termini is clearly  dependent upon a futurestate of civil  aerial  transport, and need  not  be  at onceinstituted as a charge upon the   nascent  industry.   Suchcharge could only be borne if alternative military and navaluse of the facilities were to form  a means of  distributingthe burden  of  the cost on other shoulders than the transitcompany&apos;s.   Tho  eventual need of such  housing no doubtexists,  but the  cost of  such  housing will bo so  largely dependent on the size of aeroplanes used that  an estimatewould  be unavoidably  misleading   and would  differ at oneterminal station from what  it would  be at another  wherasmaller craft might be the main types.                                              23/10/17.
Memorandum  by.Major  E.  Elvey  Robb as  to  Intermediate  Landing Grounds.  1. Distance apart,    Mr. Holt Thomas,  in  his recent lecture before  the Aero-  nautical Society, suggested that  tho distance between each  landing ground  on an aerial route should bo ten miles, and  at the  inception of civil aerial transport tho provision of  landing  grounds on  this  scale would  appear essential in order  to  minimise  risk   of  accident,   ftoino  economy might be  effected by providing a  regular  landing  ground with  attendance and  accommodation  every  twenty miles&apos; with  facilities   for   forced   landings  midway   between every two landing grounds.   These  facilities  for  forced  landings on emergency grounds could  be arranged by carry--  ing out a limited amount  of work  in the way of  removing  hedges, felling trees, etc.   Emergency  grounds would only  be used in case of absolute  necessity. 2. Size.    Each landing ground should afford a clear run of  GOO yards  in every  direction.   If  any serious obstacles exist  on the approaches to the ground,  the  size, of tho ground may havo to be increased.  It is not essential to  havo  a  ground 600 yards square. An &quot; L&quot; shaped ground will suffice if  it affords  a clear run of 600 yards in  any  direction, provided each arm of tho &quot; L &quot; is at least 300  yards wide.   The area of landing grounds on this  basis  will average 60 acres. 3. Surface.   The surface should (bo level so that machines can normally land upon and taxi across the ground without injury. 4. Soil,    Selection will   naturally  be  confined  to the line  of  the aerial route,  but, subject&apos; to this, landing grounds should, as far as  practicable, be chosen on light,  porous  soil  withnatural drainage. Grounds with clay soil invariably requirespecial drainage. 5. Approaches.   The approaches-or, at  all events, the  majority  of  the approaches should be open and free from serious obstacles. It will frequently be necessary to fell trees, remove  haystacks, etc.,  on adjoining grounds, and telephone and  tele- graph wires on  roads bounding landing grounds will have to be lowered or carried underground.  Statutory  powers for those purposes will be required. 6. Surrounding country.  This should  afford facilities for forced  landings in case ofengine failure when &quot; taking off.&quot;7. Preparation.   This will consist mainly  of grubbing hedges, piping, andfilling in or boarding  over  ditches and  watercourses,  level-ling,  tree-felling, etc.  The cost of preparation will natu-rally vary according  to the nature  of the  site  and theamount of work involved.  An average expenditure of . 1,500will cover  the cost of preparing landing  grounds.  Compen-sation payable to the owner and occupier for disturbance(other  than  to   crops)  will  average    500  per  ground,making  a  total  of  . 2,000  per  ground.    The   costof preparing  &quot; emergency grounds &quot;   will nvcrnge  750per ground, and   350 per ground should  cover compensation(other than  crops)- 1,100 per ground  in  all.  statutory powers authorising the necessary  work  of  preparation indefault of agreement, and prescribing a method of ascer-taining the compensation  will be,necessary.8. Accommodation.                               &apos;  &apos; &apos;   At  intermediate landing  grounds not used for the  recep-tion of passengers or freight, and  where no provision forcarrying  out   serious  repairs  is  contemplated,  the onlyaccommodation required for landing purposes will be :     (a) Attendant&apos;s  hut  with exchange  telephone connec-        tion;    (b) Small store for petrol and oil.   This accommodation can be provided for the average  costof  400, which includes provision  for telephone connection,which will  be a serious item in some districts.9. Cost of  hire.   This will average  1  per  acre  per  annum  throughout great  Britain.  To this figure must be added, for  the first year in the case  of arable,   4 per acre, and in the case ofpasture,   1 per  acre for tenant right and  disturbance of crops.   These figures  are additional to  the compensationestimated in paragraph 7.  This estimate is based on actualexperience  with  military  landing  grounds,  and it shouldbe stated that the figures  referred to have only been arrived at by caroful  management.  Grazing  has been permits subject  to  the restrictions  mentioned  below,  and certaij grounds have been put  out. of  action during the months k May  and June  to  enable them to bo laid down  to  hay, J. some  cases, grounds  managed on theso  lines,  havo shown. small  profit and this has brought  down the average cost t the figure  mentioned.   How far  it would  be possible I deal with landing grounds on an aerial route in  this mannis is  a  doubtful  question.  Grazing on  landing grounds is( matter that requires  very close  attention, and it is necessan to  pen the stock or place it under the control of a  shepherj or  dog.  Experience has shown that  in the daytime  shetj only  should  bo permitted to graze on  landing grounds ( which any extensive use is made.  On grounds which are nci in  use during  the night,  stock of all  descriptions can grazed from  dusk to  dawn.   If  no arrangements for grazing or  laying down to hay  aro  permissible,  the  estimated cost of  hire would bo   1  10s. per acre.   Compulsory.powers k purchase  or hiring in default of agreement will be necessan 10. Marking.  It is difficult  from  the air to distinguish landing grouni from  the surrounding country,  and they, therefore, require marking  in ,a distinctive manner.  A chalk circle  100  fed in  diameter and with a band 3 ft. wide,  has  proved &apos; effective, and can be seen  from practically any attainabli height on a  clear clay.  It  is necessary to keep the sign a good  white colour so that  it stands out well,  and this is done  by  lime-washing the  chalk  from time to  time. name  of tho ground  should also be  marked in chalk letters 1.5  feet  long  by 3 feet wide.  Emergency grounds should have  a  distinctive sign to  distinguish  them  from regular landing grounds. 11. Lighting.  Numerous  experiments in  methods of  lighting  landing grounds have been tried. The result of  a large   amount of  experience in  night  flying is that pilots  prefer slmpli methods.  A number of paraffin or petrol flares, arranged) such  a manner as to indicate  the  existence of a  landitij ground and  to illuminate the landing  area, has  proved most  effectivo method.   The  position or  number  of  tk flares  can be  varied  in  a similar manner  so as  to  indicate to  a pilot the locality of the ground.   In some  cases,  it ii necessary to indicate obstacles on  the  approaches  to&apos; exits from landing grounds by red lamps.  There are  various  minor details  in connection with tli) lighting of landing  grounds which require  consideration, as to which detailed  information can be given  if required The above particulars  will, however, suffice  to  show  thai in  tho ordinary way the lighting  of these  grounds  is i simple  and relatively inexpensive matter. 12.  APuinte&apos;nia-nce of Banding Grounds.  The grass  requires  cutting or grazing  and  the  grouni rolling from time to time.13.  Summary of estimated expenditure on preparation fin       hiring.

Final  Report  of  Special  Committee  No. 2.   Special Committee No.  2  submit the following report, dealing us far  as appears possible at present, withhose matters referred to them which  are  not  covered by their Interim Report.                      AERIAL TRANSPORT OP PASSENGERS AND  GOODS.   In  considering the practical  possibilities of aerial transport generally, the Special Committee, in theirnterim report, dealt more  particularly  (see  page 43) with air mail services.  In their  present  report  the ominittee propose to deal with the carriage of passengers and  goods, including the question of the  probabilityit&apos; otherwise of the use of privately-owned  aircraft.      As to the types of machines which are likely to be  used in commercial  services, the  Committee&apos;desire   o emphasise one aspect of the technical reports of Colonel 0&apos;Gorman and Mr. Bairstow, which are appended   o. their  interim  report as Appendices A  and C.    These  reports were furnished in answer to a request by    i,e.Committee that four widely different types of aeroplane now in military  use  should  form the  basis of a    port as to the limits of the capacity of aeroplanes generally.  The  four types were selected so as to cover    le whole range of existing machines, and the estimates given of the performances to be expected are illus-   rative of the possibilities of aeroplanes  generally.   Thus, the data  set forth in these  reports can be usedve s a basis for estimating  the performance of the commercial  aeroplane in  the  immediate  post-war period. &apos; ^he  variations  in  design  which  commercial  services  will  render necessary  are only  of  a  secondary   haracter.  There is no  difficulty  in adapting aeroplanes  to  the carriage of passengers and goods, as well     of letter mails.  The case is  different with airships.  As far as airships are concerned, it will be  observed   rom  the report  by Wing  Captain  Maitland,  which is  attached hereto  as Appendix A, that while the  existing  types, which  possess a very  large proportion of disposable lift, may be  expected  to prove, within    mits, suitable for commercial  work,  far better  results  could  be  obtained by specially designed airships, as    te lines of development,  up to  the present, which have been  purely military,  have not  been  such as. to   jroduce  the most suitable airship for commercial purposes.       Generally speaking, the Committee are  of  opinion,  that the carriage in aircraft  of  mails, passengers,    nd goods will  present  no difficulty from the  technical  point of view.   It would appear from their terms    &quot; reference, which  mention the question of running costs, that the  Committee  were expected to attempt tiliiome forecast of the probabilities of the commercial success of such carriage.   This has proved practicallycat mpossible from the lack of any experience of commercial  aerial  transport  up  to  the present time.   The  &apos; imount  of business over which  a civil aerial  transport  company would have to spread its standing  charges     therefore  a matter of uncertainty.    Moreover, in the absence  of  any reliable forecast of the amount of   msiness over which aircraft manufacturers after the war will  have to spread their standing charges,  the    jrime cost after the war of the machines, upon which the cost  of using them must largely depend, cannot&apos;Mie  even  approximately  estimated.   The  Committee feel that they are  safe in  saying that, given a demand   or the carriage of mails,  passengers, and goods,  there are no practical obstacles in the  way of organising   lerial  services to  meet  that demand.   The Committee would again point out that, in initiating aerial trans-   )ort services, due advantage should be taken of the novel facilities offered by the use of aircraft, e.g.,ISO,perJ    (D In the case of mails, by  competing with telegraphic services or in establishing a new type of expressetter service;    (2) In the/ase of passengers,  by competing  with rail,  marine, and road services over long distances,ir where the journey either includes sea as well as land passages,  or  is between places  not convenientlyierved by rail.   (3)  In the  case of goods, by enabling ordinary merchandise, commercial samples, and even (if necessary)pare parts of machinery  urgently required, to be conveyed  quickly  to  places otherwise inaccessible exceptiy journeys involving great expenditure of time.   While it is  quite possible that the earlier commercial  use  of aircraft  will  take  the form  of regularervices, particularly  in the case of letter mails, the  Committee suggest  that  one of the first methods ofmploying  aeroplanes for the transport  of passengers may  lie not  in the flying of craft between cities atpecified times, but in the occasional and increasing use of single machines for rapid journeys  in  any direc-ion,  rather than along a fixed route, carrying one or more occupants who may be prepared, owing to theirgency of their business, to  pay special  fees so as to secure the high speed of transit which will be possibleiy air.   Such first  and occasional passenger  work, which might increase  until it provided an  appreciable butlot large  source of revenue, and  would have the advantage  of  educating the  public  as  to  the  rapidity oferial transit-thus preparing them  for  the time when regular  services were started-could be undertakenimnediately peace comes, since it would  not be open to the same objection as would any premature attempt toon a daily service  to schedule irrespective of weather conditions.   After the war, therefore, we can contemplate  the systematic organisation of existing  resources in thetape of aerodromes, pilots, and  suitable machines,  so that passenger craft, flown by  skilled and reliable&apos;.&amp;&apos;&amp;o.uld be hired at so much per mile  or day for rapid journeys.   It should be possible to arrange things  tn &apos;2a  Dusy  man might engage a machine for a journey  from London  to Dublin,  Paris, Stockholm, or )e liico. by telephone from  any post office or convenient public office.  The wide use of such a service would ipend largely on  the facilities  being universally known and understood, and upon its being generally acees- ible under standard conditions.   Otherwise it might become only an  occasional convenience  for people with ifficient leisure to make the necessary enquiries and arrangements.   The development of services of this kind i their earlier  stages might provide an  outlet for  a certain number  of surplus military machines of a type laptable to passenger carrying.                                                                      F
                                PRIVATELY OWNED AIRCRAFT.    The probable use of privately owned aircraft  will largely depend on the  development of aeronauticsas a recreation and a sport. This, again, will depend largely on the cost of the acquisition and use of aircraft,But since there will exist at the end of the war sufficient facilities in the shape  of landing grounds to renderflying by day free from any particular risk, although defined routes may be lacking, the Committee suggestthat for the general  encouragement of aeronautics, the establishment of flying clubs might be valuable. Suchclubs  could be either  promoted by the proprietors of aerodromes,  who would be  in a position to offer special facilities for storing machines and providing club premises,  or  could be  formed by  associations  of flyersleaving the  Services at the conclusion of the war, rather in the manner of non-proprietary social  or sportsclubs.   Such flyers  might thus be enabled to make use  of aeroplanes at a reasonable expense  and to keepthemselves in practice.   These clubs  might find employment for a small percentage of such  machines asmay  be surplus  to  naval and military  requirements,  and they would tend to stimulate the design  and construction of pleasure and touring type machines.                                        AERIAL ROUTER.    The Committee  have considered  Item 6 of  their terms of  reference, viz. :  What  main  aerial  routesmight be marked out and prepared for  now  for utilisation by an aircraft service.   The Committee  do notthink  that they  can,  in  the  light of information now  available, usefully add anything to  their  interimreport.  With regard  to  the  Atlantic route mentioned  in that  report,  they have made further  enquires as  to  the prevalence of  fog on the coast  of  Newfoundland  from  Sir E.   Morris, and   Mr.  H.  C,Thomson, of the Newfoundland Railway and Train Ferry Syndicate, Ltd.  The answers to these enquiries,which are attached as Appendix B, confirm the view that the  fog  does not as  a  rule rise very high above the, Isurface of the sea,  and that it does not generally  extend more than a mile or two inland.                 1 I                                   AERIAL MAIL SERVICES.    The Committee desire to draw attention to a revised memorandum by Mr. Harper on an experimentalair mail service from London to Glasgow, which is attached as Appendix  C to this report.   This super-sedes the original memorandum (Appendix E to the interim report), and the times  have been worked out1on a load of 100 lbs. of mails with machines of a maximum  speed of 150 m.p.h.  and an average speed of 120m.p.h.                                      PROHIBITED AREAS.    With regard to prohibited areas,  and any  regulations  which should  be made  for their protection, the!Special  Committee  are of opinion  that these are matters  the  consideration  of which  should  be  deferredJuntil  after the war.                                          NIGHT FLYING-.    In  considering the problems of night flying and tho requirements of signalling and lighting in connec-tion therewith, the  Special Committee have had the advantage  of  advice   and  information  from  GeneralHiggins, of the  6th Brigade, R.F.C.  The problem of lighting landing grounds is probably the most impor-tant.  The  system  of  lighting  at present in vogue in the case of  military landing grounds  provides for  aline  of flares placed in. certain numbers and at certain fixed distances  (in accordance with the class of theparticular ground) on  a line corresponding  with the direction of the wind, with a flare at right angles tothe right at the windward, end of the line.   A  diagram of  this arrangement is attached to this Report as appendix D.  In  addition to these flares,  lighthouses showing various sequences of flashes are employed to mark certain points. &apos;  General Higgins does not regard the system as by any means  ideal, and  in orderto make commercial flying a success at night,  so that traffic  can  proceed  to scheduled time, regardless ofweather  conditions, other than exceptionally  bad conditions,  he  recommends research  and  experimentson  the following lines :  (a)  Directional wireless,  (b) Sound signals, (c) Lighting of routes by vertical beamsproduced by paraffin vapour at fixed  distances of, say, 10  miles apart, (d) the use of a powerful beacon onlanding grounds, in addition  to some system of  paraffin flares for indicating the direction  of the wind.    The Special Committee  approve these  recommendations,  and  they would  further point out that,  provided suitable arrangements  can be made to ensure safe landing, night flying will be feasible as a commercialproposition, and will be of considerable value from the commercial  point of view, even upon the assumptionthat, owing to weather conditions, it can be carried on during  only, say, 30 per cent, of the nights of theyear.  The necessity for forced landings can be eliminated almost altogether by the use of multiple-enginedmachines,  and,  provided a pilot is  skilled and has good sight for seeing by night,  the landing of a  machineon  a really well-lighted aerodrome  is  practically as easy by night as by day.   On foggy nights it will benecessary to provide signals for example, star shells-to indicate to pilots the position of an aerodrome whichis equipped with a  complete system of lighting.   The illumination of all landing grounds on a route in themanner suggested by General Higgins would be of tho greatest assistance to night flying. Assuming the lattersystem  to be impracticable in the earlier stages of civil  aerial transport, there remains the possibility  of equipping  the machine  with its own searchlight  for  the purpose of illuminating the ground  on which  it is  pro-posed to land.  With regard to signalling in connection with  night flying, the special Committee think thatthe  development of wireless communication between  aircraft and the ground, which has already been touched on  in their interim report, will afford a solution  of the  main problems involved.     Since  the problems of night flying are at oresent  under investigation, and the methods of ensuring safetyin this  kind of flying will be the subject of  rapid development, the Special Committee do not put  forww?detailed recommendations, but they present the following  summarised conclusions :-     (1) Night flying will be valuable from the commercial point of  view.     (2) Improvements in the  methods  of  illuminating landing  grounds, both on  the  ground and  from         machines themselves, should be sought for.     (3) The illumination of aerial  routes as an aid  to navigation  (apart from landing facilities) is desirable.     (4) The development  of directional wireless is  of the highest importance.

OF THE  DRAFT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION.    This Annex was referred to the Committee by Special Committee No. 1.   It  contains such regulations as to lighting of  aircraft, rules of the air,  and rules as  to landing and distress signals as were agreed to  bythe delegates of  the various European Powers attending the Paris Conference in 1910.  Recent developments in aeronautical science and  practice render necessary certain  modifications of  these  regulations, more par-ticnlarly  because  at the time of  the Paris Conference the proposed regulations were considered more fromHie aspect of  the  use of airships than of aeroplanes.

APPENDIX A.                              The  Airship  for  Commercial   Purposes.  In attempting to form  an opinion of the capabilities ofairships and aeroplanes  respectively as commercial  vehicles,it  is  important  to  bear  in mind  certain phases  of pasthistory.  In the first place, the design  and construction of airshipshas up to the present in all countries been mainly confined tothe Services, and where private firms have been concernedthey have been engaged on producing  airships suitable formilitary purposes.  In taking airship performances during thewar  as  a  standard of future commercial development itshould, therefore, be remembered how vastly different are thorequirements of commercial- and passenger-carrying airshipsto those which have hitherto been paramount in  the minds of  constructors.   The  modern Zeppelin, for instance, is designed  for  rapidity  of climb, the attainment  of greatheights, and the carrying of large quantities of bombs, speedbeing a secondary consideration.  In a commercial airship increased speed  will be necessary if  a regular service is  to  be maintained, while a height of1,000 ft. will be  ample for normal flying, though greaterheights should bo  attainable if necessary.  The weight-liftingfeature would  be retained for the carrying of  goods  and passengers.  Existing German military airships have proved themselvescapable of attaining a maximum speed of over 60 m.p.h., witha &quot; disposable lift &quot; available for crew, fuel, bombs, etc., ofover 30 tons, remaining in the air for something like  36 hours,and  attaining a height when over this  country of 18,000 or19,000 ft.  There is little doubt that a commercial rigid airship could be constructed to-day with  a maximum speed of 75-80 m.p.h.,.capable of covering 2,000 miles with  a load of cargo of 12-15tons; or 600 miles with 30 tons of  cargo (or 210 passengerswith 50 lbs.  of luggage each).  With care in designing  it should be possible to design anairship  having  the speed  named with  comparatively slight increase in engine power and of the same size as the present-day  Zeppelins.   The  Germans, owing  to  the necessity forrapid output, have adopted a comparatively inefficient form,from the aerodynamic point of  view, but with an airship oltrue  stream-line   form the higher  speeds should  be easilyattainable.   In  this connection it is interesting to note thatthe  Germans were  able to reduce  their horse-power from1,440 to 1,200 in ships of practically the same size and shapewithout the loss of speed, merely by  removing two wing preKelJftrs and the attendant bracing, which offered considerable esistance to progress through the air.  The fact that a  number of Zeppelins  have been brought down over  this country  and in France does not affect thevalue of airships for commercial purposes, as the inflamma-bility of tho gas with which they are filled does not give riseto any danger in normal flying.   In spite of the  enormousamount of  flying which  has been carried out by airships inthis country during the  war, there has been no  case of thedestruction of one of these craft owing  to  its catching firein the air.  One of the objections to airships which  is frequently raisedis  their inability to fly in strong winds.   This is  in part dueto the comparatively slow speeds which have been obtainedup to the present, for the reasons stated above, and whichcan undoubtedly be improved upon  with careful attention to design having that end in view.  It is, however,  largely dueto the difficulty of handling airships on the ground in highwinds  owing to  the large surface  they  offer to the wind.There is no doubt  that this difficulty would be, to a  con-siderable extent, overcome by the adoption of revolving shedson land or floating sheds on water.  The best method, how-ever,  undoubtedly,  would  be to  abolish sheds altogether except for docking purposes and maintain the airships  per-manently moored out.  Experiments on these lines  are beingcarried out, and sufficient progress  has been made to showthat the difficulties are  by no means insurmountable.  Kiteballoons are frequently towed at wind speed  of 70 m.p.h. and upwards, and an airship moored out in an improvised shelterhas recently ridden out  a gale of 60 m.p.h.  The many practical advantages which the  airship possessesfor commercial purposes are not, perhaps, always appreciated.  Present-day airships, which in  no way approach the limit of size, as has already been pointed out, have  a  disposablelift of over 30 tons, which  enables them to  embark  on  longflights without the necessity of descending for replenishmentof fuel.  The initial  weight of the power plant is,  for  the same reason, of less consequence than in the case of the aeroplane,which  renders efficient  silencing  possible, and at  the sametime simplifies design owing to the weights not having to be cut down to so fine a point.  There is no reason  why an air-ship should not be fitted with engines as 6ilent as those  of a motor-car.  Sleoping accommodation can,  in any case, beprovided well away from the power plant, and there is com-plete absence  of such noises as the singing of  wires whichwould  detract from the comfort  of passengers  in an aero-plane. In  this connection  it may  he pointed  out  that inthis  country airships have up to the present-owing to the   * Since this report was presented to the Main  Committee,  the detailed recommendations in Appendix E have been inoorpor&amp;ted inAppendix A to the Report of Special Committee No. 1.  See p. 27.   t Reservations by General Groves and Colonel 0&apos;Gorman as to Appendix E will be found at the end of Appendix A to the Report ofSpecial Committee No. 1.                                                                                     .

limitations of output-necessarily  been  fitted with enginesdesigned for aeroplanes.  The special requirements of an air-ship engine are too detailed to be gone into hero, but greatimprovements are undoubtedly obtainable by tho use of suchengines.  An airship can remain in the air however low thospeed may be, so that the engines can be throttled down when required, thus effecting considerable economy in petrol con-sumption ;  while the fact that the  engines need  not  neces-sarily be run for long periods of time at full speed has obviousadvantages from the design standpoint.  Tho power plant  can  bo readily split up into as many unitsas desired there being  no advantage in concentrating thoweights and failure  in tho   power-plant does not involveimmediate  descent, while running repairs  can  easily  be ieffected in  the air.  Even with landing grounds  only ten miles  apart  an aero-plano would be compelled to fly at a minimum  height of about,000 ft., whereas  an  airship can  cruise with safety  a fewhundred feet above the ground, which considerably  enhancesthe pleasure  of passengers by  affording them  an opportunity ,,of enjoying the scenery.  Tho difficulty which  an aeroplane pilot has  in judging thoattitude of his machine to the horizontal at night, or in fog,mist, or cloud,  docs not obtain  in an  airship,  which  alwaysremains on an even keel.  An   airship can set out on  long llights over the  sea ormarshy and wooded country without fearing engine failure,At intermediate stopping places it can come down to  withina few  hundred feet of the ground  and  moor  to  a  grapnel(or drogue if over the  sea)  to replenish fuel, without actuallylanding.   Similarly, an  airship can fly  at night  with com&quot;.pleto safety, navigation being  carried out by the ordinarynaval instruments and observations  of the stars made froma steady platform on  the  top surface.  In conclusion, the commercial  airship of the not-far  distantfuturo will have a &quot; disposable lift &quot; available for crow, fuel,and  merchandise,  or  passengers of  50  to  00 tons or more,It will have a speed of 90  to 100 miles per hour, with ampleaccommodation for passengers in the shape of saloon, drawing.room, smoking-room and state-rooms, with a lift giving access to a roof  garden on tho top, and will be  able to remain inthe air for a week or more at a time.  After  a  journey  itwill  return  to moorings like a  water-borne ship,  only beinghoused in a shed for periodic overhaul.                                 E. M.  MAITLAND,  December, 1917.                        Wing-Captain,                                                APPEND]               Correspondence Relating to FogCopy  of letter  from Sir  E.  Morris, to Lt.-Col.  Waykind,                  dated 3rd  Jan., 1918.  &quot; I  am  much interested  in the question  of  fog on thecoast  of Newfoundland in its bearing on tho question nowbeing considered by the  Civil Aerial Transport Committee.I have lived all my life in  Newfoundland, and  have fre-quently sailed  in the spring, summer and autumn seasonsaround the  coasts of the country and Labrador.   Betweenthe ages  of  fifteen and eighteen I lived  at a  place  inPlacentia  Bay,  probably  tho  bay  in Newfoundland havingtho highest percentage  of  fog.    During  these years Icruised and  sailed a small pleasure yacht, and  I can  speak with  a certain  amount of  personal  experience.  Generallyspeaking,  Newfoundland  inland or along her coasts has nofog which could correctly be designated as  &quot;local.&apos;   Ourfog comes in from  the Atlantic Ocean when the winds arebetween  North-East and South-West.  There  are seasonswhen even with a S.-W. or N.-E. wind we may not have a fog.We never, by any chance have fog when the  winds  are fromany point between  S.-W. going West around to  the  N.-E.It  follows that as  our  prevailing  winds,  sometimes con-tinuously  for months, aro from the W.  and  N.-W. wo have very little fog.  I have seen a whole season from April  to november pass without  rain or  fog.   When the  fog doescome in  from   some  atmospheric  cause,  it lies  low  rightdown on the water, and it is a common occurrence  to seethe sun-shining on the hill-tops  and fog down on the sea.So  much so is this the rufe that the practice is to build ourlighthouses  on  high promontories from five to six hundredfeet high.  Further, as  a rule, the  fog does not penetrateinland very far, but is eaten up and absorbed by the land over  which  it  hangs and it  is  a usual and common dailyoccurrence to see a bank of  fog  outside the harbour  and aglorious sunny  day  inside without a vestige of fog. Further.the fog is perfectly  white,  and  although  at  times  thick,would not, I fancy, be found  too dense for landing from theair, as I  think it will be found that the fog does not reach the height  at  which  airmen fly.   Under  all  the circum-stances, I think it  will be found  that there are  no  special difficulties in the way of Newfoundland being the landingstation on the western side of  the Atlantic for any aero-plane service after the war.  Further, I  think on enquiryX  B. on  the  Newfoundland  Coast.it will not be difficult to procure evidence  to support this position.&quot; Copy of letter from Mr. 11. C. Thomson toLt.-Col, Waylund,                  dated Uth Dec., mi.   &quot; In reply to your request for further information  aboutthe nature of the  Newfoundland  fog, I may say  from my own experience that the fog does not, as a  rule,  rise very high  above the  surface  of the -sea.   From some little wayoff it can often be seen lying on the sea like a regular bankof fog with clear sky above it.  Sometimes, too, when it is so dense on  the water&apos;s edge that one can hardly  see a ship&apos;s length off, it is so thin  above that the sky can justbe made out.  Very often, too, there is a clear belt betweenthe fog  and the land-the land,  as  the sailors say,  &apos; eatsthe fog,&apos;  and even when it closes right in on the  coast, it only  extends  a very  short  distance  inland.   I have often seen  St. John&apos;s so enveloped in fog that the harbour cannot be seen at all, whilst  a  mile or two  inland there  is  bright sunshine.   &quot; In the interior there is very little fog indeed.  I write from  recollection,  but  I  think  Lord  Northcliffe  drew attention to this  in  a speech he made some  four or  five years ago   at  a  meeting  of  the Anglo-Newfoundland Development  Company.   &quot; I will try and get this  for  you next week.   There is also  a remarkably  clear belt  stretching across  the Gulf of St. Lawrence from St.  George&apos;s Bay on  the west coast of Newfoundland to Chatham in New Brunswick.   &quot; The average of fog in St. George&apos;s Bay,  you will see from  the  lighthouse  percentages I send you,  is  so small as to be  practically  negligible, and  the  enclosed  corre- spondence and the statistics furnished by the Meteorological Office some years  ago shows that the fog  at  Chatham is also  exceedingly small, much  less than either to the North or to the South of it.   &quot; There are many  excellent  landing  places round St. John&apos;s,  and  as  it is  the  capital of the island   it. would probably be the best halting place for passongers; and the flight from there  to  St. George&apos;s Bay would  be  over the land all the way, and  freer from fog than if a landing were made near Cape Bace and the  flight continued from there.&quot;APPENDIX C,Revised Memorandum  by the Assistant Secretary  (Technical) as  to  an  Express Air-Mail             Service between London  and Glasgow,  via Newcastle  and Edinburgh.  It is assumed  that in an experimental express service, started immediately after the war, only a limited quantity of urgent mails would be carried, at a special fee, and that the  bulk of the mails  would  still  go, as at present,  by land.  The service contemplated in  this memorandum is a purely express service.  Others will doubtless  be established, such,  for  example, as those in  which large  machines  will carry passengers and  parcels as  well as mails.  A London-Glasgow service has been chosen for illustration for  several reasons.    In  the  first place,  it requires at least a 250 miles&apos;  flight, at an  average,  say, of 120 miles an  hour,  such  as that from  London  to  Newcastle, to demonstrate the speed of an express air service,  and  for this speed to offer  a sufficiently marked saving of time over railway  transit, remembering that  one  must reckon   the time taken in establishing  the  land connections of an  air service.   By instituting a London-Glasgow  express service, and by, so  arranging  the  time-table  that  a business man could post an  urgent  letter during the  morning  in London orGlasgow, and for this letter to  reach its destination well before the close of  the business clay, one would offer afacility which  cannot be offered  by  existing means of com-munication; and it  is argued that, when  given this newfacility, the business  world would learn to make use of it.   The aeroplanes employed on the service are assumed to bemachines which, carrying a pilot and  100 lbs. of mails, willattain a maximum speed of 150 miles an hour, and main-tain an average of 120 miles an hour.  The land communications  of an express air service mustbe taken into consideration as having  an important bearing on the time-table of  the  service  as a whole.   The organisa&apos;tion of such  land communications is  a matter  within  the purview of the Post  Office, since the  collection of mails atthe outgoing office,  and their distribution  from the officeof  arrival, must of  necessity be under their  control.  Ithas been  found impossible in this  memorandum to assignany specific time for  the sorting  and distribution of letters,and therefore no estimate  of the time taken  in the landcommunications has  heen attempted,  other than tho time

                                        APPENDIX    IV.                             Report  of  Special Committee No.  3.     1. The Special Committee were asked to advise as to the development and organisation of aircraft produc- tion from a commercial and financial point of view, with special  reference to      (1) The encouragement of the production throughout the Empire of the various types of aircraft required        for organised aerial services, particularly so as  to ensure a  sufficient margin of supply for military        and naval requirements.     (2) The probable availability of capital for use in the  production  of  aircraft  and  in  organising aerial        services, and the possible necessity of State ownership or of State aid to  private enterprise in these        respects,  either by direct subvention or by specially favourable treatment of some other kind.     (3) The possible necessity for some special control over the raising of fresh capital by companies or firms        engaged in the production of aircraft and the  running of aerial services.     (4) The possible necessity,  after the conclusion of  the war, of immediate measures to protect such exist-        ing trade interests as are  dependent upon war  contracts.     (5) The extent to which existing organisations, working under war pressure conditions, will  require to        be  modified  in  order to establish them on  a permanent  peace basis.     (6) The consideration  of the cost of production of aircraft.     2. At the outset of their enquiry the Committee have met with certain  difficulties which are necessarily inherent in  the problems on which they have been asked to advise.  The aircraft industry, as it exists to-day, is an organisation amply equipped with capital, material, machinery,  expert knowledge, and trained  labour; but  at the same time  it owes its  development and its   present  position   wholly  to the  phenomenal  war demands of  the naval and military authorities.  For this reason  it cannot be regarded in  relation  to post- war problems of reconstruction in the same light as other established  British industries.   There is no  past experience of trade on a peace basis to guide the  Committee, and,  since the post-war aerial programme of the  Government must necessarily depend on  a number of military, naval, and financial considerations, which it is impossible at this stage to  forecast, and  indeed  upon the result of the war itself, it cannot be expected that any authoritative information can be furnished as  to the  probable direct Government demand  for air- craft on a peace basis.     3. Assuming,  however,  that  there  will  be  some considerable diminution of direct Government orders at  the end  of the war, the Committee  have thought  it advisable to  consider, first of all the position of the aircraft industry generally  at that time,  and more particularly  during  the interval which may be expected to occur between the probable diminution of naval and  military orders for the Air Forces at the conclusion of peace (whatever the  extent of such  diminution  may  be)  and the  renewal of  such orders coupled witli some possible orders  for  civil  aerial transport  purposes;  and,  secondly,  the  constructive   steps  which should be taken to bridge that interval.     4. In presenting  their views and recommendations, the  Special  Committee  desire to emphasise what they regard throughout as an incontestable  assumption, namely, that aerial power will be as necessary for the  protection of Great Britain and the  existence of the Empire  in the  future  as naval power has been in the  past.   The Committee  are accordingly  of opinion  that it will be necessary, after the conclusion of the War, to take  such measures as will maintain the power  of ^production in this country, with its  attendant power of  design and progressive  experiment.   Without  continuity  it would be  impossible  to   have  the organisation immediately available when required. Furthermore, if such a policy  for National Aerial Defence is adopted as will have the effect of maintaining  the  aircraft industry  on a reasonably  sound  basis, the development of aviation for civil aerial  transport should )be  the  more rapid, inasmuch as those engaged in the industry  will possess this power of design and  production, backed by the necessary financial  resources available for  extension  to the development of aviation in its civil  and commercial aspects.     5. If the  expectation is justified that at  the end of  the war  there will be a  considerable  falling off in direct Government orders-and it  has to be borne  in mind that even if the same aerial  force that exists at the end of the  war is to  be maintained on a peace  basis the  falling off will be great,  owing to the much longer expectation of life of aircraft  under peace as compared  with  war  conditions-the conclusion of peace will bring with it a  reduction not only in the number of firms  engaged in the industry,  but  also, by the cessation of overtime and night shifts, in the output of the remaining firms.  But, when such establishments as are at present engaged  as a temporary war measure in aircraft building have  reverted to  their  normal&apos;pre-war businesses, the productive capacity of the remaining establishments may  still be more than is neces-sary to maintain the National Aerial Services.     6. With regard to the probable development of aerial transport  services,  the  Special Committee would refer to the facilities  which this form of transport will  provide in letter mail services and in journeys  over long distances,  or where other means of transport  are  undeveloped or  do  not  furnish direct  connections.It is^ thought that fast aerial mail services should soon be  able to compete with expensive long-distance cableservices, as, for instance, from London to South Africa.   Yet  their  development will be  gradual, and thenumber of aircraft they will employ, in  the  earlier years, at any  rate, will be  small,  because, even on  asanguine view of the  amount of  letters which will be sent by air mail at a high rate of postage, the weightof them will  not be great,  while passengers will  be few.  It is hardly to  be supposed that newspapers  andprinted matter will be sent in large quantities by  air  mail for some  time to come.  It has to be borne inmind,  too^ that air routes will be mainly international, and that foreign countries will expect  that a share in the business  will be given to  their own aircraft.   Viewed,  therefore,  as a commercial proposition, tblCommittee do not  think that  civil aerial transport is  likely,  at least for some years  to  come, to develofto such an extent as  to involve  any appreciable  volume of orders being  placed with the productive side ofthe industry  in this country.  As far as the immediate  post-war period is  concerned, it should be remem-bered that machines  for civil and commercial purposes  will  unquestionably need to be specially developed,and  any considerable volume of orders  will have  to  await the completion of this process  of  development.The Committee, therefore, come to the conclusion that, while aerial trausport services will ultimately offerhopeful -prospects from the financial  point of  view,  the  construction  of aircraft  for that purpose,  even  if
211j. the services attain to the fullest dimensions that can reasonably be anticipated, could for some time to come  only reach comparatively negligible proportions, and will be such as to be by itself wholly inadequate for the  maintenance of the  aircraft industry,  even on a  greatly reduced basis.      7.  The conclusions of  the Committee  as to the first question mentioned in paragraph 3  above may  be  summarised as follows :       (a) The Committee are unable to foresee any such early development of civil  aerial transport as could          by itself  keep the aircraft manufacturing industry alive.      (b) It is essential that the services of the  aircraft manufacturing industry continue to be employed  for          the design  and development  of naval and military  aircraft,  and  for  the carrying  out  of  the          national  constructional requirements of the future.   If that is done, then  no  special steps would          seem  to  be required in  connection  with civil aerial transport to establish the industry on a perma-          nent peace basis.      (c) Failing the employment  of the  aircraft manufacturing industry for the purposes and to the  full          extent above indicated, then the industry could  only be  kept alive  for civil aerial  transport pur-          poses  by  active Government assistance, not necessarily  in the  form  of  subsidies on manufacture,          continued over  several years to come.  The foregoing  conclusions  point to the necessity of some constructive steps being taken  to ensure the raain-  tenance of the aircraft industry.      8.  In considering the position of the aircraft industry  on the termination  of  the  war  the Committee  have had before them  an interesting memorandum by Mr. A. E. Turner, which is presented  as an Appendix  to the present Report.      9.  Before  offering  suggestions as to  the constructive steps to be taken,  the Comrnitee desire  to point  out that it is of the first importance that  the  task  of considering and  of  dealing with constructive proposals  in regard to all aeronautical  matters after the war should be definitely  assigned without delay to some one  Government Department which would, of course, only act after consultation with  such other Government  Departments as might be concerned.   It  appears  to the Committee that such matters should be dealt with  by a single Central Government Authority, but that, to be effective for this purpose the Authority should work  in conjunction with a body representing the Industry.      10. The Committee are of opinion that the solution of the problem of the constructive steps to be taken,  and with it the  solution of the problem  raised  in the second  heading of the  terms of  reference  to  the  Main  Committee  as to  the disposal of the  surplus of machines likely to be in the hands of the Naval and  Military authorities  after the war, should  be sought along the lines of so using this surplus as to stimulate  immediately a demand  for aeroplanes in  some new direction.   The  Committee therefore recommend :-      (a) That an offer should be  made by the Home Government to the larger self-governing Dominions          and to Egypt  and  India to  supply  a definite number of machines,  free of cost, as soon as they          become  available,  conditionally on  these  countries, in  the meantime, submitting approved schemes          for the formation of units of an Imperial Air Force.      (b) That the Government should announce  that in the event of the formation of  companies  for aerial          transport services,  or other  commercial  purposes,  they  would  be  prepared to afford facilities  for          the purchase of machines  at a  reduced  price (say, one-quarter or less fraction of the original cost)          to substantial companies.  This  will operate to facilitate the  employment of pilots  who  will  be          returning to civil life on demobilisation.  These two proposals taken jointly would relieve  the Government of  heavy expenses in providing  storage  accommodation for  machines which  are too valuable for destruction, and should also relieve the stagnation  in the  design  of military types which would  inevitably occur if the necessity of using up  large stocks  of  surplus aeroplanes prevented the  authorities from  placing any but the smallest possible  orders for machines  of new design. The design of aeroplanes expressly for civil  purposes would also receive a stimulus, as  the  companies would early begin to find points in which the machines thus taken over   were susceptible of im-  provement from the point  of  view of the new use to which they were being put.      11. On  the broad  question which was raised  at the first meeting of the Main Committee of State owner-  ship against private enterprise, the Special  Committee hold the view that the industry of aircraft production  and transnort  should be so dealt with as to interfere as little as possible with individual enterprise.      12. The foregoing paragraphs cover,  so  far as seems possible in the light of such information as is avail-  able, the subject  matter of headings (1), (2),  (4), and (5) of the terms of  reference to the Committee.  Data  are wholly  lacking by which to estimate the cost of production of aircraft or the  running costs of civil aerial  services after  the war,  and the Committee fear that detailed discussion of the  subject matter of headings (3)  and (6) of their terms of reference would  be  premature at the present stage, and could serve no good purpose.

    Those members whose names are marked with an asterisk append the following reservations :-    I do not consider that the aerial  mail service will actually compete with  (see line 4  of paragraph 6 of thereport), but that it will  be complementary to, and will probably activate the use of long distance communica-tion by electric cable.                                                                        Mervyn 0&apos;Gorman,  Lt.-Colonel.    1. While I accept the conclusion that present conditions do not justify the  advice that the  State hereshould immediately itself undertake  the  industry of aircraft production, and that, therefore, constructive steps are necessary to ensure  the maintenance of that industry by the enterprise of the firms and  companies whichhold the  field,  I consider that before long  the wisdom of establishing State control of and active participa-tion in that industry will be recognised, and  practical  steps will be taken in that direction  for the benefit ofthe nation.    2. I do not discern  any insuperable  obstacles in the way of an early practical commencement of civil aerial  transport within  the United Kingdom  as a State undertaking,  or under  direct  State control,  and  regret that it has  not been found  possible to include in this  report practical suggestions  for experiments inthat direction  at  the earliest possible moment.                                                                                       W. P.  Schreiner.    I  desire to add, by  way  of reservation, that in my opinion paragraph  6  of  the report  gives an undulygloomy impression of the prospects of civil aerial transport in the near future, especially in regard to passengercarrying.                                                                                           A. E. Turner.                                              APPENDIX.Memorandum  by  Mr. A.  E.  Turner  on  the Position of  the Aeronautical industry                              on  the Termination  of  Hostilities.  There  are  two  questions  for  consideration  in  thisconnection :     (1) Will any special steps be necessary to enable the       industry to tide over the  transition  period be-       tween work on a normal war footing and work on a       normal peace footing?    (&apos;2) Wi&apos;1&apos;i  the industry  bo able  to  stand  alone  when       normal  peace  conditions  have  been reached and       orders for aircraft.have  found  their normal  peace       level,  or will some measure of  State assistance be       necessary?  As regards the second, it appears to me that the industry should not require any further State stimulus than will be afforded  by the  placing  of Government  orders  to  meet(a.)  peace requirements of  naval and  military  aircraft;(b)  machines  required by  tho Post (Offioe, Customs andother Government Departments.  Assume as a reasonable estimate that  when the war endsthe  total  output of aeroplanes will be in the neighbourhoodof 3,000 monthly.  One half of  this, approximately,  maybe regarded as  automatically ceasing by the closing  downojf  the national  aircraft  factories  and the cessation of overtime  and  night shift.  Assuming  that a certain numberof private firms now in the industry will wish to turn overto other work,  a certain portion,  or  in some cases thewhole, of the facilities they now employ on aircraft, equiva-lent in the total to a reduction of 250 machines a month,and that normal peace orders for naval and military air-craft will not fall below  500 a month, and we are  left withan output of 750 monthly for which a market has to befound.  The  only markets which will exist are :  (1) foreign and Colonial orders;  (2) orders for civil purposes under government, GiP.O., Customs, etc.;  (3)  private  commercial and transport services;  (4)  sporting and pleasure require-ments.  The  transition  period between war  and normal peace conditions, however, I regard as affording  a very serious problem  and one  which should be faced  at  once.  the stoppage of war wastage will  not only-unless some special steps are taken mean a complete stoppage for some timeof naval and military demands,  but will also leave a sur-plus  for disposal which  will  probably more  than  suffice tomeet all civilian requirements for a sufficiently long time toensure  the practical extinction of the industry which hasbeen built up.with so much labour and  energy,  and consti-tutes, in my opinion, a most valuable national possession.                                           2/11/17.
                                        APPENDIX  V.                 Supplementary   Report   of   Special  Committee   No.  3.     1. The Special Committee have been asked to consider certain points raised by Captain Groves  in  a   jtice of Motion handed  in  to the Main  Committee.  The Special Committee had not previously dealt with[/u ese points because by their terms of reference they were called  upon rather  to  advise as  to the  probable;hjsition  of the aircraft manufacturing  industry in this country  at  the  end of  the war, than  to  consider    ther it was necessary  in  the  general interest of the State to take special  steps to foster the civil use of   craft.     2. They have  now considered the  further points referred to  them, and desire to emphasise that it is of   eat importance, in the  national interest, that the use of aircraft for civil purposes should by some means   other be fostered to the utmost extent, and  with the utmost  rapidity possible, immediately after the war.     One reason is  that the civil use of  aircraft will ultimately play an important part in the  commerce and   j msport of the future, and it is undesirable that the British  Empire  should   fail,  through  allowing  other:   countries to  be first in the field,  to secure its  due share of such  commerce and transport.  .    -     A second and  very vital reaon is  that in any future, war the air  will play a more  important part thaner er, and unless the State is to maintain on a peace establishment a naval  and military air  force as large as   vill require in any future war,  there must be a reservoir of aerial power capable of meeting  a sudden demand     the  expansion of the naval  and  military  air force, just as the shipbuilding industry and the Mercantile   nine  are capable of meeting such a demand  on the part of the Admiralty.     3.  It has  been shown in the previous  report of the Special Committee that if the aircraft manufacturing    industry is to be almost wholly dependent on direct State  orders for  naval and military  aircraft,  and such    ers fall off greatly  at the end of the war, as it is only  prudent to assume that they  will  do,  the aircraft    uufacturing industry will dwindle with  great  rapidity.   Therefore, in  order  to keep the manufacturing    industry in a state of  healthy activity,  and to secure that there shall be as large  as  possible  a  number of air-    It and of skilled and practised flyers-in existence available to be drawn upon by the  State, it  is vitally    portant that a market  should  be  created, for  aircraft other than  that provided by the State&apos;s direct  naval    i military orders.                                                                  .     L  It is not enough-merely to maintain the aircraft manufacturing industry  in a static condition : it is    essary, particularly in an industry which  is still  at so  early  a stage of its growth,  that  there  should be    ry opportunity  and inducement for the inventor and for progressive  development  and  improvement  in     gn.   This  consideration only  serves to emphasise the importance of immediate steps being taken to foster     civil commercial use of aircraft.   Progress and improvement are likely to  be best stimulated by the hope    commercial gain,  as has been shown  in the history of  other industries, notably that of  shipbuilding.     5.  The  Special Committee adhere  to  the view expressed in their earlier  report that it is impossible  to     see  any such early development of civil aerial transport as could by itself&apos; keep the aircraft manufacturing    nstry alive ; but it follows from what has been said  above that it must  be developed at any rate to such an.    ent as will ensure that the  resulting orders will  suffice,  along with such direct  naval and military  orders    lontinue to be given after  the  war, to secure the end  in view.     This end will  have been  achieved  when a system of  properly planned  and predetermined air  routes  has     n instituted, with  their aerodromes and other requirements, satisfying both  military and commercial needs,     iveen which there is no real conflict.   On  these routes there should be  civil aerial services wherever there     reasonable demand for the facilities of aerial traffic and irrespective of the test of financial success.   Such     ices should ensure a: large  reserve of skilled airmen and of aircraft available for, at any rate,  subsidiary    ftary purposes, and should  afford  a market for aircraft manufacture  sufficient  to maintain the manufac-     ng industry on a scale allowing of  a prompt and large expansion of the industry for war purposes.     6.  The  development of civil aerial transport to the extent outlined in the  preceding paragraph  cannot, in     opinion of the Special Committee, be  brought about without some State action.     The State may :-                                                                                              ... -* -     (A) Give its assistance in one or more of many possible forms to  private enterprise; or     (B) may itself own and operate or participate in the ownership and operation  of aerial transport  under-takings.   These alternative policies have been very fully discussed by this Committee, and it is thought desirablethe respective arguments in support of both policies should be set out.   -mative(A) :-  &quot;On behalf of this course, which is that favoured in  the  earlier report  of the Special Committee, para-Ii  11,  it is urged that, as in the case of manufacture, so also in the case of the civil use of aircraft, theof commercial return is.the most effective stimulus to enterprise, and that the experience of almost all enterprises, at least in the United Kingdom, supports this view.b support of private  enterprise, whether  entered into by firms or companies, it is argued that progress&apos;Ti more rapid than has been  found possible under the  machinery of  Government  Departments.  The  i civil aerial transport seems to be  one which calls for  special enterprise  of a  peculiarly open-minded.cter.  The exploration of  the  possibilities of civil aerial transport  must be undertaken in a spirit  un-aielled by those methods which have hitherto been usually associated  with Government control.  Bapid.ess in this new field of transport is  essential if this country is to hold its own.It is urged against the exclusive operation of aerial transport services by the State that this system would]that  the State would be the only purchaser of aircraft; and that this  would necessarily discourage  the
desired  development of invention and  design, and  might  involve  the necessity  of  the  State  taking  tlbusiness of manufacture as well as of the use of aircraft into its own hands, a course which, for the reasogiven in paragraph 4 above, is to be deprecated.    It is urged further, therefore, that :-    (a) Firms or companies should without interference be allowed to undertake commercial services  whet         they are willing to do so.    (b) Firms or  companies which undertake services desired by the  State, but likely in themselves to b         unremunerative, should be assisted by the State to  the  extent  calculated to provide a reasonabl         return  on the  capital  invested.   Such assistance might  take the form of a guarantee of a minimti         rate of interest on capital,  or even of cash subsidies  fixed according to  the number of aircraft  am         skilled flyers kept in continuous employment.  Precedents  for arrangements of this kind are to h         found in  cases where the State has assisted steamship companies by providing, on  very easy terras         part of the capital cost of ships constructed to certain approved specifications or  by subsidising ft         ocean carriage  of mails.    Among other methods by which the State could assist private enterprise where such assistance is requiredare the following :-    (1) Charters might  be granted to properly organised companies, giving them exclusive running rights f         defined aerial routes, either in the United Kingdom or in the British Dominions and Colonies.    (2) Aerodromes, landing places, meteorological  stations and wireless  telegraphic installations which will         in any case, have to be provided for the naval and military air force throughout the country, migi         be put freely at the disposal of private flyers and commercial undertakings as the roads  are put at the         disposal of the travelling public.    (8) The establishment of high-speed land transport by motor  vehicles and otherwise between aerodrome         in the vicinity of large towns and  the business centres of such towns.    (4) The State  might encourage, by liberal contracts, the  carriage of mails and parcels  by air, or migl         undertake to take up a certain proportion of the accommodation &quot;provided for such carriage.    (5) Facilities  might be offered for the purchase or hire,  at low  prices,  of  aircraft  surplus to  military,         requirements at the end of the war.    (6) A retaining fee might be paid to such owners of aircraft as agree  to hold them at  the disposal  of ti         State.Alternative  (B)  :--    On behalf of the State ownership of civil aerial  transport services, either exclusively or in partnership witprivate enterprises, it is argued  :-    (a) That since it is admitted that State assistance is in  any case necessary  for the development  of th         civil use of aircraft to  the extent, necessary in the national interest, a system under which all chance         of profit are left to private companies, while the  State  undertakes a  great  part of the risk, and th         certainty  of expense, is the least  desirable  system from the public point of view, and  the most expose         to justifiable criticism.    (b) That if the State  must undertake civil aerial transport services in the national interest, it should a         least undertake or participate in owning and controlling those services which promise to yield a pro         as well as those which do not.    (c) That such a system would avoid the possibility of confusion and  economic waste through unnecessa         competition between private companies  in  a field in which  the State protected them from loss, an         the  certainty of waste involved in private companies obtaining Provisional Orders or Private Acts o         Parliament, and in such directions as the expense of company promotion&quot;and the unnecessary multi         plication  directing staffs.    (d)  That State ownership or participation with private enterprise need not be an unsuccessful method o         development.    (e) That while the ownership by the State of commercial  enterprises may lie under the burden in eac         case of justifying  its own necessity, it may fairly be said that in this instance  the insufficiency o         unsatisfactory  character of the alternatives put forward furnishes the  required proof, and that trans         port has always been one of  the  first fields in which public ownership has shown itself successful, a         witness even in Great Britain many municipal tramway enterprises.     (f) That, moreover, in this particular instance the  matter is so bound  up with national defence  tha         any  State would  be justified in  going  far beyond its accustomed  limits  in  commercial   undei         takings in order  to make  certain  of creating the equipment of men and material and the source         of  production  needed for its own protection,  and that whatever may be the normally held  viewc         State ownership, State ownership  of aerial transport services including all ancillary  equipment i         forced upon the community as an unavoidable measure of national  self-protection.     8. The Special Committee feel that  the questions of principle and policy involved  in the two  alterna tive views described above raise such  grave issues  that it is for the Main Committee itself  to  judge betwee them;  but  in any case it seems necessary  that the steps to  be taken to  secure the main  object airnedjfjl namely, the provision  of  the indispensable reservoir of  aerial power, should be considered and determine upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government  at once, as it will be too late to consider them after the war.  If a the conclusion of  peace direct naval and  military orders  fall  off very greatly, and  no steps have been take in advance  to create other  markets for the manufacturing  industry,   the   manufacturing   industry  flil dwindle with great rapidity  and may  well cease altogether  to exist, except  to  the extent   necessary t comply with such diminished  naval  and military  orders as the State may still continue  to give.  It cannot

NOTE.-A summary by the Chairman, Mr. White Smith,  of  the two reports  of  Special  Committee    3 is attached.                         Brief Summary of First and Supplementary Reports.                                      Special Committee No. 3.    The questions  originally  put to the Committee and the  conclusions arrived at  can  be briefly stated ascf lows :     What  will  be the position  of  the  aircraft designing and constructing industry at the conclusion of the  ar, and how far can the industry provide  for the requirements of  civil aerial transport for aircraft?  It11  as immediately found that, so  far from there being any difficulty  in meeting the  requirements for aircraft,  le  demands for civil aerial transport,  for  some  time, would be quite inadequate  to keep the industry alive.  was considered essential in  the interests of National  Defence  that the industry should  be kept  alive.  le Committee, therefore, felt that, in  order to keep  the industry in such  a condition as to be  always able to  spond to  -war emergencies; the services of the industry should continue  to be employed for the design and evelopment of  naval and military aircraft,  and for  the carrying out of  the national construction of aircraftIr the future, and this would enable the design and  construction  for civil aerial transport to grow  on a  und and  permanent basis.    In effect, while  the Committee have always felt complete confidence in the eventual success of  civil and Miunercial transport, yet they  felt that, for some time to come,  it could not be looked upon to support the  dustry.    The other phase of the question which is  dealt with by the supplementary report  may be summarised iat-    (a) Cost what it may, this  country must lead the world in civil aerial transport.    (b) The State must have a  reservoir of  aerial power capable of meeting a sudden demand for expansion       of the Naval and Military Air Forces.    Put shortly, we may say, &quot;It must be  done.&quot;   Approaching  the question, therefore,  from this  point  view, it  becomes  evident that, if civil aerial transport is  so necessary to  national interests, every step possible must be taken by this country  and the Empire to foster the rapid development of this form of aerial ower, and by it  the power of production in this country.    The development of civil  aerial transport  to the extent outlined in  the preceding paragraph  cannot,  the opinion of the Special Committee, be  brought about without.some State action.    The State may :-    (a) Give its assistance in one or more of many possible forms to  private enterprise;  or    (b) May itself own and operate, or participate in the ownership and operation of, aerial  transport under-       takings.    The arguments  in support of each  of these policies have been very fully discussed by the Committee, andne set out fully in their Report. It is  desired that the members of the Main Committee shall consider thema full as set out, and for this reason no resume has been  attempted.    In conclusion, the Special Committee feel that the questions of principle and policy involved, in the two  ernative  views described above raise such grave issues that it is  for  the Main  Committee  itself  to  judgebetween them;  but in any case,  it  seems necessary that the steps to be taken to secure the main object aimed  namely, the  provision of the indispensable reservoir of aerial power, should  be considered and determined ton by His Majesty&apos;s Government at once, as it will be too late to consider them after  the War.  If atPconclusion of peace direct naval and military  orders fall  oil&apos; very greatly,  and  no steps have been  taken  advance to  create other markets for the manufacturing industry, the manufacturing industry will dwindlefith great rapidity and may well cease  altogether to exist,  except  to the  extent necessary  to comply  with bli  diminished  naval and military orders  as the State may still  continue to give.   It cannot last without  ers while the State is considering what steps can be taken to develop the commercial  use  of aircraft-a rocess that is likely to occupy some time.

(4)  The necessity for an administrative body or bodies to control the entire industry of  aeronautics wij        regard to labour and labour conditions,  including technical education, as above mentioned, and        question of  the representation on such body or bodies  of the State, the employer and labour, andtl1&apos; P        limits within which the control of such  a body  should  be exercised.                              r11?                                                                                                     1)01]                                                                                                     Igim                                                                                                     jttei    1. The Special Committee have given their  most careful consideration to the questions submitted to thely aby the Main Committee.  Before proceeding to deal with detailed points arising on its terms of reference, tin. c wour in  o.Idol&apos;rSpecial Committee  have thought it advisable to submit at the outset of their report the conclusions they haldarrived at in relation to the four headings to which special attention is directed in those terms of referenclginThese conclusions are submitted in the form of answers  to the specific questions raised in these four headings :Ie \earboiduMSdibee1diac    (1)  (a) There is no possibility of setting up a model type of industrial organisation  applicable either  r  .   ..the  whole  of the  labour  employed  in  aircraft manufacture or  to  separate  groups of  laboil01,1,&apos;    r,   so  employed.    At  the  same  time  the  Committee think  that  the suggestions contained ila        the  Report  of   the   Sub-Committee  of  the  Reconstruction   Committee  on   the  relation!^   -  .   between employers and employed  (generally known as the Whitley Report) are no less applicable        the relations of labour and  capital in aircraft  manufacture than to labour employed in the wholly... r-    group of engineering industries.  -  .  .                                                         I       v(b) The Committee come to the  same conclusion with regard to  labour or groups of labour employe!    ..  in aerial transport services; but they would suggest that,  since  at present there does nSt  exist sl^        organised body of labour employed in aerial transport services, such  a body might offer a  special&quot;        favourable field for the realisation  of the ideals outlined in the Whitley Report.-  .  (-2)  There are no special problems connected with the dilution of labour and the rates  and methods 1        calculating  wages peculiar to labour employed in  aircraft manufacture or in aerial transport service        as such.                                                                                      Iue    (3)  There is  no necessity for  any special scheme of  technical education applicable  to artisans an-  .   --mechanics,  male  and female, employed in  aircraft manufacture  and in aerial transport  services, af        distinct from similar  persons employed in other occupations; but  the Committee  think that at        schemes of  technical  education of persons&apos; employed in the engineering industries generally are pai I       : ticularly suitable to persons employed in the aircraft industry,  and that  such schemes should be a        arranged  as to include the technical education of  the latter class.    (.(4),  There is no necessity for  the creation  of  an administrative body or  bodies to control the entire it        dustry of aeronautics  with regard  to labour and labour conditions other than the machinery of tli        Joint Standing Industrial Councils  recommended in the  Whitley Report.    Tn  submitting these conclusions  to the Main Committee, the  Special Committee have divided the maiproblem referred to it into two general  headings,  viz., the problem of labour in aircraft manufacturethe problem of labour in aerial transport  services.   The grounds upon which these conclusions are based aicontained in the following paragraphs of this report.                                        Labour in the Industry.    2. In this body of labour  there were employed in 1916 about  100,000  persons, of  whom about 25,iwere  women or  boys under military age.   These  numbers are constantly increasing.   They are, indedgrowing so rapidly with the growing demand of the Government for aircraft-which demand has of late beisuddenly and very greatly expanded-that  reliable  statistics are very difficult  to obtain.   Even if they coilbe  obtained they  would  at  once  become  out  of  date,  as   fresh  firms  come  into  operationaircraft constructors.   So  long  as  the   war  lasts, there is  likely  to be continuous increase  in number  of  persons  employed.    The construction  of aircraft engines is  a specialised and  highly iaportant  section  of  engineering,  and  it  necessitates the  employment  of  a  considerable  number oskilled  mechanics-fitters, turners,  coppersmiths, sheet-metal workers, etc.-as well  as a due proportioiof semi-skilled and  unskilled  workers.  The  construction of aircraft, in which woodwork is at present mprincipal factor, involves  the  employment of woodworkers  of varying degrees of skill, and to meet the demiifor additional labour brought about by the war, large numbers of woodworkers have been drawn into the isdustry from other trades, including the building.trade, furniture trade, coachbuilding, etc.  In both section!of the industry (engines and aircraft) there has been not only &quot; dilution,&quot; but also the introduction of femaillabour to new work  prior  to the war.  The  employment of women has steadily extended.* Mr. H. G. Wells, the Chairman of this Special Committee, appends a Minority Report which is set out at the end of this report,
214 . 3. The Committee discussed the possibility of dealing with the industry as a distinct economic organisa- oU)  and  dismissed this  as entirely impracticable.   Mainly,  the  industry is  a branch  of  engineering of  a imilar nature to the automobile  industry.  It seems impossible to sub-divide the engineering industry  any- -here by  vertical lines of division.  Skilled and  semi-skilled labour flows to and fro, in its own trade, between ne department  of  engineering work and another.  Engineering labour  organisation  and engineering  tcchni- 3I education, the Committee are persuaded, are each whole and indivisible problems.  4. The  Committee find  that  under the Reconstruction Committee there have been appointed Sub-Com- littees on relations between employers and employed, and on War Pledges, while Committees have also, been anointed on the engineering trades; on the textile trades ; on the teaching of science ; and on juvenile educa- on in relation  to  employment after  the  War.   Of the bodies above mentioned, the Committee are informed iat the terms of reference to the War Pledges  Sub-Committee  of the Reconstruction Committee  merely,eal with  the legal  steps that would be necessary on the assumption that all the  pledges given to organised ibour during the war in connection  with dilution, the employment of women, and the like, are to be carried tit in their entirety, a matter which is not directly the  concent of this Committee.   The  Committee  on eience in the Educational System are as yet only at an  early stage of their enquiry.  The  Report of the ounnittec on Juvenile Education in  relation to employment after the  war has been published as a Parlja- icntary Paper  (Cd. 8512), and forms the  basis of the Education Bill.  5. The Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee on relations  between employers and  employed, nder the Chairmanship of Mr. J. H. Whitley,  M.P..  is the body most directly concerned  with the  post-var problem of  the relations between  labour and capital, and has issued  an Interim Report on -Joint Standing ndtis trial Councils, which has been  published  as  a Parliamentary Paper  CD.  8G00.   The Committees ppointed to  consider the position after the war of the great groups of industries  classified under the  head  of ngineering have been content to leave this aspect of their problem to be dealt with  by  Mr. Whitley&apos;s Com-  ee, and we  feel that  a  Committee dealing  with the as yet comparatively small  aircraft industry, especi- lly as it  depends so largely  on the engineering industry, may  well follow their example.   The rapid expan-ion of the manufacture  of aeroplanes and airships  has, however,  attracted to the aircraft  industry  a  large nd miscellaneous  body  of labour whose  elements  were  formerly  connected  with  trades  other than the ngineering  trade, and whose members belong to Trade Unions concerned with entirely  different trades, e.g.,lie various  branches of the building  trade, coach  and carriage building  and upholstering, cabinet making, gan building,  etc.  The majority of  these workpeople are woodworkers, and while many of them are skillednen,  possessing the degree  of skill  necessary for their previous occupations,  the skill called for by  the air- aft  industry is not a highly specialised skill, which cannot be used in.other woodworking  industries.   It nay be that  many  of those who, prior to the special demand of the Government for aircraft for war purposes. fere  employed  in  other industries,  will return to those industries if the end of the war brings with it a  great liminution in the demand for aircraft; it must, however, be asumed that the  aircraft  industry will exist in theiiture to  a very much greater extent than was the case before the war, and it&apos; follows, therefore, that the abonr problems connected with the industry will be influenced by the &quot; new blood &quot;  which has come into the industry,  and by the forces with  which that  &quot;  new blood  &quot;  is connected. The possibility  must not be  over- ooked that in the future wood may be more or less replaced by metal in the manufacture of aircraft, and that :onsequently the total number of  woodworkers employed in the industry will be uncertain.  6. It is  impossible to forecast at  present the special labour  problems .that  are likely to arise in the industry,  and it  is useless, therefore, to attempt  any detailed suggestions as to how they may  be  dealt with vhen they do arise.  But there are one or two features which it may be worth while briefly to mention,  as hey  will serve  to  show in  what respects  the industry differs from the ordinary well-defined industry and to ndicate the type of problem with which those who are concerned in the industry may be faced.  7. At the moment the aircraft industry is more closely allied to the engineering  trade  than to other rades, and  the  principal firms are members  of  the Engineering  Employers&apos; Associations  in the  districts  in vhicli their  respective  works  are situated;  the industry  is, therefore,  linked on the employers&apos;  side,  with he organisation of the Engineering  Employers&apos;  Federation, while the  skilled engineers are members of the various skilled Trade Unions connected with&apos; the engineering  trade.  On the other  hand,  the Trade Unions o which  the bulk of the woodworkers belong (and they are numerically a very large proportion  of  the in-  &apos;ry) are not primarily connected with the engineering trade;  they are connected  with  trades such as theJiiilding trades, and they have the associations and traditions of those trades. The third class (and  it  is an mportant one) consists of the women, who are employed on the engineering side, the woodworking side, and s fabric hands, and who, in so far as they are organised, are members of the National Federation of Women &quot;orkers  or of one  of the general  workers&apos; unions who specialise in female members.  These three groups of rade unions have not hitherto been identified with  a single industry, and their traditional interests may tend be divergent.   The position is one that calls for special consideration on the part of the employers, and it iy, no doubt,  be  assumed that  it is  already receiving such consideration at  the hands of the  employers&apos; rganisations.   We feel  that it is for  those organisations,  in conjunction with the  labour  organisations,  to insider for  themselves  how the  special circumstances may best  be met and that -it would not be helpful for its Committee  to attempt to advise them.                                                  .   .  8. How far the various  labour organisations within the aircraft industry may be able to reconcile their nterests, it is impracticable now to say.  Some of the  woodworkers,  themselves  members  of  the various woodworking unions, have formed woodworkers&apos; aircraft  committees in  various  centres,  and W it should jappen that  the women&apos;s  organisations are able to join with  such Committees,  there would exist  a  fairly ell-defined  &quot; labour side &quot;  to the industry, consisting, on the one hand, of the engineering section (repre-     a? stated aDove*  by tlie skilled Engineering Trade Unions), and  on the other  hand of the woodworking fPfabric sections  (represented by  some  joint  body of woodworkers&apos;unions, plus the women&apos;s organisations)..  9. Having  regard to the special  development and rapid growth of the industry, and to  the somewhat iculiar character  of the trade (being linked with but  not entirely  covered by  the engineering  trade  as fdtnarily understood), there  may be  difficulties  in adopting directly for the aircraft industry the scheme  of Nut Councils recommended by the Whitley Committee.  The consideration and solution of these difficulties re. in our view, matters for the parties directly concerned rather than for  this Committee,  and we  think
our  participation in the question should begin and end with the recommendation that in the consideratjof the subject the parties should have in mind the principles underlying  the  Whitley Report,  and eho]approach  the problems in the spirit indicated in that Report.                                       Labour in the Air Service.     10. The Committee have also given their careful attention to the question of the labour connected withroutes and services.  Exact figures of the  labour likely to be so employed cannot be hoped for at the prefijtime, but it seems improbable that the civil  use of aircraft can immediately absorb any appreciable tract!of the trained personnel, which the conclusion of  peace may leave surplus to the  requirements  of the ntrfand  military air services.                             Education of  Labour in the Service and  Industry.     11. The Committee  are of opinion that the technica  education of aircraft workers cannot be convenienJtreated as a special subject; like the labour  itself,  the educational work is divided between the engineering al the woodworkers&apos; trades, and the Committee  see no advantage in adding anything here to the counsels of otibodies well able to  deal with those matters, such  as the recently formed central organisation  for the correjtion  and improvement of engineering training.                                                   *A.

While the engineering employers have been fully and ably represented on the Committee, the idealslabour have had  little or no  expression, and there has  been, he thinks, a  disposition to exaggerate the iiportance of the welfare of the industry in relation to the destinies of the Empire.  This is particularly maifast  in the shortness and quality of the  paragraph relating to the Air Services.   An  excess of tendernessthe  no doubt deserving  private groups that may wish to undertake  &quot; air &quot; transport at  the end of the wiand  an excess of financial timidity, seem to have, blinded  the Special Committee to  the supreme importauto the Empire of the immediate establishment of Imperial Air Services at  the  Peace.  For such an endbusiness adventurer in air exploitation should be  as willing to face stress and ruin as our common soldie]have been to face toil and death in Flanders.     The British  Islands are small islands, and our people numerically a  little  /people;  their only  claimworld importance depends on their courage and  enterprise,  and  a people  who  will not  stand up to tlnecessity of an Air Service planned on a world scale and taking  over thousands of aeroplanes and thousanjof men from the  very onset of peace, has no business to pretend to anything more than a second-rate posit!in the world.   We cannot be both Imperial and mean.   For this reason the Chairman  dissents  altogetfffrom the timid findings of the Special Committee set out in paragraph 10.     Assuming, as he does, that a boldly  conceived world  air service is essential to our Imperial pretensionthe Chairman deplores the narrowness oT outlook that has debarred  the  Special  Committee from seizingopportunity to plan an Air Service not only great in scale but great in spirit.  This Civil Air Service afford!the possibility of  a new departure in the organisation of our workers, and the Chairman of Special CommittiNo.  4 appeals from that Special Committee to the Main  Civil Aerial Transport Committee to consider, befoiit  is too late, the possibility of creating from the first a great service with a common spirit.  Here, at lea^we could anticipate and  avoid the clash of direction and  labour.   It would  be possible to associate fromfirst  the entire personnel of the service with the  management.   It would  be practicable and in accordauiwith the more constructive ideas  that now animate  labour circles  to give  everyone employed, from  traSmanager and pilot to groundmen, a representation upon  the general management.  What is proposed hereno mere &quot; labour &quot; delegate.  What is desirable is a  state of affairs in which everyone in the management v^0feel  concerned  in the mental and bodily welfare  of the  personnel, and in  which every worker, whether cjthe directive or the operative  side, will consider himself concerned for the efficiency of the Service.   Everyoiin the Service could have a voice  in the appointment of  these  suggested   representative  members  of  tlmanagement.   There are two chief interests in every service of public utility; the first of these is the geneicommunity, for which, logically, a portion of the management  appointed  by the  State  should stand;  tlsecond is the  Service itself&apos;, for which stand the  representatives of the directing staff and of all engaged in tlth,Service.  In the  case of a State-owned Service,  these two elements would constitute the entire managemeElhain the case where private enterprise was a factor  it would also provide a third factor in the general managgrirment.  Suppose,  for example, an aerial transport company, fostered by the State for reasons of policy by tl tigrant of monopoly running rights over given routes, or by a guarantee of a minimum rate of interest on If \capital.  It might be managed by a Board of Directors, some appointed by the  shareholders  in  the ordinafnway, some by the State, to watch its interests, and  some by the employees.  If it be admitted that suchfjmarrangement would tend to prevent disputes and strikes, it is probable that it would commend itself to,State.   The State would have a direct interest in the smooth and continuous working of the Service.interest would  be presupposed in the grant of monopoly running  rights  or in a guarantee of a minimum raljetiof interest on capital, and the State might even make the adoption of an arrangement of the nature  suggest^ S1a condition  of its grant  of such privileges.  But  these possibilities have been disregarded by the Special Coif  t 01 is; nioUn-pc ec n ac  iierh 1 leins     * Mr. Berrimin signs this report subject to the deletion of the following words in paragraph 11, &quot; like the labour itself, tho educationwork is divided between the engineering and the woodworkers&apos;  trades,&quot; mime,
2153:  ,ittee as a whole.  Many of its members seem to have been obsessed by a conception of private enterprise  orking  its way slowly to an efficient air service  at  the  expense of casually  employed workers.  From  the  rsfc the  workers under such conditions will  be  forced into the self-protective and hostile attitude too charac-   istic of British labour.  Unhappily for the British  employer  it is incredible that  Berlin, America,  or  the  jrld generally will wait while these time-honoured British methods feel their way  through a cycle of labour  ljustments to a minimum of efficiency in a maximum of time.   The Air Service of  the world will inevitably  s taken out of British hands-if  this is our way  to Civil  Air  Transport.   Unless we are  prepared to plan  o\v for  a great public air service, generously served  by generously treated workers, it is childish to anticipate  ny great future for our Empire in the air.    The Chairman also regrets that the Special  Committee has been unable, as a whole,  to make any  recom-  ^endations with regard to the employment of discharged sailors and soldiers.  There are at present numerous  pportunities for the utilisation of partially  disabled sailors  and soldiers in the aeroplane factory, and there  i no  conclusive  reason why much of that  employment should not continue after the war,  due regard being  hown to Trade  Union interests.  There are many occupations,  both in the aeroplane  factory  and  in  the  erodrome, where physical disabilities of a not too serious nature do not debar men from useful work-in some  ases  after a  preliminary period of  practical training.  Splicing of wire cable, for instance,  and acetylene  elding  are sedentary jobs requiring no great exertion, which can be done by any man possessing the  full  Use of his  hands, arms, and eyesight.  These jobs are successfully undertaken by women, but at  the present  ime  there are probably not enough women trained to meet the  demand.  Many  other jobs could also be  indertaken by men of this kind, such as those of storekeepers, record  and issuing  clerks, watchmen, care-  akers, and works&apos; police: also  those of gatekeepers and  turnstile keepers at aerodromes, and of groundmen  or keeping aerodromes in proper condition.  The  intermittent  nature  of aerodrome employment makes  it  teculiarly suitable for men whose injuries, while leaving them capable of occasional activity,  unfit them for  lontinued hard work.   And these remarks apply not only to those engaged in actual labour, but also to those  vho may be engaged in the management of these  various  grounds.  It  is to  be noted that the  Ministry of  Munitions Dilution Department is giving attention to this particular problem,  and will probably  accumulate  lome  valuable experiences.    Generally, these  men will be  in receipt of pensions,  and there seems to be no justification  for the  ruleii liulerstood to prevail in the  case of men directly  employed by Government, under which a man  in receipt of  i pension is not allowed to draw in the shape of pension and wages combined more than the rate  of wages  irdinarily given for work of the nature of that in  which he is  employed.  It would appear  that a man in  eceipt of a pension of 25s. a week,  if employed by Government on a job for which the ordinary rate of wages  ras 25s. a week  or over, would draw no pension  at  all while so employed; or, if employed by  Government  m a job for which the ordinary rate of wages was less than 25s. a week,  would draw only so much of his  lension  as would  bring his total weekly emoluments up to 25s.  This rule must, it would seem, put a premium  MI idleness and upon taking service with a private employer rather than  with the  Government, for in  the  ervice of a private employer a pensioner would draw his wages and his full pension as well.  It is certainly  forth while to draw  attention to this point, although it does not arise exclusively in connection with  the air-  iraft  industry.    It is possible  that a difficulty may arise in connection with the employment of disabled  sailors and  soldiers  f their injuries are such as  to incapacitate them  from earning Trade  Union rates of wages, owing to objec-  ions on the part of the Unions to their being  employed at lower rates; but  such objections ought  not to be  insuperable,  provided none but  ex-sailors and  ex-soldiers  in receipt of pensions are employed at less  than  Union rates, and provided that they are so employed that the wages which they can fairly  earn, when added  o their  pensions, makes up  a total  emolument equal to or greater (by  an agreed  upon amount)  than  the  Union rate of wages, and that their employment  is not more profitable to the employer.   This is a question  upon which a speedy  agreement with the Trade  Unions  is most desirable.  What is needed is some  general  decision  upon the rules under which  disabled soldiers shall be employed.   It may be suggested that the Trade  Unions should themselves propose a classification of disabled men, and should  suggest a minimum wage for  each class-on the assumption that employment will not diminish the amount of the man&apos;s pension.    There is  a third matter in  which the  Special Committee has failed to rise to its opportunities, and  that   in  connection with  the possibilities of developing an  imaginative   solidarity  in the  Air Industry  and  Services.  To be frank upon a matter of public importance too urgent for euphemisms, the  bulk of employers  u Great Britain appear to  be men  differing rather in tenacity of character  that in breadth of outlook from  the workmen they employ, and they do not seem  to understand that elementary psychology  of  modern  in-  lustrial  employment.   They do not see their  duty and opportunity of  mental leadership;  they decline flatly  o be the  captains instead  of the exploiters of industry.   The modern  worker reads,  thinks,  and has his  imagination stimulated in a  hundred ways  that did not exist in the dull round of  the mid-Victorian wages-  serfs&apos;  experience.  In  addition, we shall  presently be seeing  the return to  industry  of great   numbers  of  workers whose minds have been further quickened by the war.   It is  the interest,  therefore, quite as much  as the public duty of the modern  employer to  do  his utmost to give the worker a living interest in  his work,  o make him, or her, feel, not a driven &quot; hand,&quot;  but a person sharing the effort and triumphs of the industry.  The alternative is that disastrous  and dangerous modern product, the professed &quot;rebel.&quot;   Something more  han  merely technical training is wanted for a proper industrial mentality; imaginative training is about equally  important.   Among other devices  that should be employed in the organisation of a modern industry,  is a  &apos; trade &apos;&apos; paper brought within the reach and attention of every worker; a paper to  sustain  the living  interest  of the   orker in  his industry, to facilitate understandings, stimulate  ambition, and keep  him or her alive.  n the case of the Air Industry  and Service, a weekly illustrated paper devoted to the  enterprise  of, and  innovations in, aeronautics, to the illustration  of  model works at home and abroad, to the discussion of  new    jjjhods and  trade problems, and to the impartial discussion,  by means of correspondence, of current labour    acuities, is required.  The free  and full  development of the latter feature is highly important.   Every com-  letent authority upon labour troubles agrees that  the essence of these troubles is suspicion, and the way out of  &amp; suspicious situation is for management and worker alike to cultivate outspokenness and  &quot; play with the cards  in. the table.&quot; With  this proposed  trade paper a  method of tuition by correspondence and self-education could  ie very  easily combined. What is here suggested is not  a paper merely for the discussion of &quot;shop &quot;; its  toil and effect would be to lift every worker in both branches of this field out of the little rut of merely  tiechanical participation into an  understanding  of  the story of this new and wonderful field of human effort.
SOAeronautics presents as marvellous and romantic a story as any in  the human record.  That  wonder aiu]romance are in themselves a force which, to put it at the lowest level, it  is unbusinesslike to waste.  fyjjmany employers  seem unable to  appreciate the  role of such a  stimulant.   Indeed,  some of  them seem to regard the proposal with terror, as an unjustifiable illumination of the privacies of business enterprise.    How the paper could be produced and supplied is a question  of some delicacy.   It might,  perhaps, beproduced&apos;by a  special  joint.committee,  representing the directors  and labour of the  industry, maintained by a capitation tax upon the employer of a Id. or so per head of the number of workers employed, and dig-tribiitod gratis at pay day.  But such official papers are  apt .to  lack  the  spirit  and  interest  of periodicalsconducted  upon more  normal lines.  Probably it would  be less  expensive to the employer and altogethermore successful  to select  one or several of the existing &quot;Air&quot; weeklies  and,  subject to  their  agreement to insert certain  definite features, to purchase and distribute in  large quantities.  It would not be difficultto arrange for  an added page  edited by  a special joint  committee of directors and  labour  on the model ofthe,added page in the  ordinary parochial magazine.  A  wholesome competitive element would be introduced by allowing each  worker to choose which of the several selected papers should be given him.  &quot;Another important factor in the consolidation of the Aeroplane Industry and Service which Special Com-luittee No. .4 lias preferred to ignore, is the use of the  Cinema  by the organised industry.  This could bemade of the utmost service in  attracting young people  to the  industry,  and keeping the general public in-telligently sympathetic with its progress.  It is as much  the business of modern industry to cheer, interest,educate, and invigorate, its workers, and keep the public in touch with its activities&apos;as it is to get machineryof the highest efficiency.  A business that bores or exasperates  its  employees or-the public  is  a  badly-organised  business.     This much the  Chairman of  Special Committee No. 4 begs  to add to  the report that he  here, presents,His -differences from his colleagues are probably all to  be traced in  the  end to a difference in their and hisinterpretation of  the  aim  of  the  Civil Aerial  Transport  Committee.   Several  of  the  recommendationsembodied in this -minority report have indeed been set aside by  Special Committee No. 4 only because theyare judged to be  beyond the scope of that Special Committee.  But the Civil Aerial Transport Committee asa whole, he holds, is a Committee not to make  decisions,  but  projects, and a freedom and  boldness  withregard  to  the terms  of reference and to new ideas are  more in the spirit of its creation than a careful restric-tion within its literal terms of reference.  He believes that what the Air Board wants from the Civil AerialTransport Committee is not discreet answers to  set questions, but comprehensive  plans and a  general reviewo&apos;&apos; all possibilities (of which labour troubles are  not the  least)  affecting the peace future  of the Empire inthe Air?   -:          ,                         f - -         *-.                      -   - &apos;     -    &apos;    !,j                                                                                    H.

The Committee were asked  to advise upon research and the special scientific education of expert designers,engineers, and  pilots,  with special reference  to certain details of those lines of enquiry which, are dealt withseriatim in the present report.  The two subjects of research and education form convenient main divisionsas a basis for their report, and  the  Committee propose to take them into consideration in the order named.                                          I. RESEARCH.   1.  In classifying  the different headings into  which  the  general  subject, of  research most  convenientlyails, the Special  Committee  have adopted the following division :-   (a)  Invention in regard to aeronautics.   (b)  Experiments in regard to aeronautics.   (c) Research  in regard to meteorology.   (d)  Accident  investigation.   2.  In so  far  as the headings (a) and (b) are  viewed in  the light of any scheme for  the encouragementlid development  of research, they are  so closely connected that  the  Committee find it  convenient to deal,&apos;ith them together.      The development of aeronautical science has been very rapid,  both before and  during  the war,  and,   king to the necessity in military and naval interests of  keeping  inventions and  data connected  with thishey cience secret, the full publication of results in the interests of  the aircraft  industry has been  impossible.; as hiring the  years preceding the  war the Secretary  of the Advisory  Committee on Aeronautics  prepared  1 ibstracts of foreign scientific literature, which were published as an appendix  to the yearly  reports of the   bmmittee.   These reports  only  contained  the results of  such scientific  work as had then  been  published   as distinct from work accomplished which far exceeded that made  public at  any rate in Great Britain), but   veil these  were not available  to  the ordinary investigator in a comprehensive or convenient form.  The  same   emark probably applies to similar reports from  scientific  institutions on the Continent.   There now exists    vast body of information which when made available in  some well ordered form after  the  war will be of   ital importance to the development of aeronautical science.  The chief mines of such  information are :       A. The Advisory Committee on Aeronautics.      B. The Technical Offices of the Air Board.      C. The National  Physical  Laboratory and the Royal Aircraft Factory.      3. The  Committee hold a  strong view that as a  basis for research this information must be collected and   rranged.   This will involve considerable  labour, which the Committee think can be divided as follows :-      (a) The compilation of a bibliography and of short abstracts of the principal papers ;      (b) the  publication of an  aeronautical treatise embodying a full account and critical  analysis of  the in -          formation available;      (c)&apos; the  publication of reliable text books,  based on such well  verified  conclusions its  can  be drawn from        .  this information.    I these  the most important  is the preparation of the treatise  mentioned in  (b),  and the Committee refer    ith approval to a report on  this question  by Sir R. T. Glazebrook and Professor Petavel, which is attached   s Appendix A to this report.   They draw attention  to the outline  scheme setting out the  differcntAppcudix    ictions of aeronautical science which such a treatise should cover.                                        A, p. 87.      4. It seems clear to the  Committee  that the work comprised  in headings (a)  and (b) in the  preceding    iragraph should be undertaken by the same organisation,  and  the question  arises  as to the  constitution,    nance, and control of such an organisation.  The results  of  the   work  so  undertaken  would  benefit the    wernment, the  industry,  and the public, but the most direct benefit would be that to the Government.    lie  sources of information  are under Government control; but the information itself is in such a scattered    id disjointed form as to be only  understandable by those who have in fact followed the  details  step by step,    ithin the  Government offices, and only  with considerable difficulty even  by them.  Accordingly,  the  Com-    littee recommend the institution of  a bureau for collecting and disseminating aero-technical knowledge in    ie interests of civil  aeronautics, which,  pending the establishment  of  a  Research  Association for the    dustry, should be financed by a grant from the Department of  Scientific  and Industrial Research.   The    iireau might, perhaps, be attached during  the war period to the  National  Physical Laboratory,  and  could    ! staffed by an expert investigator with  assistance and the necessary  clerks.  An estimate has been received    at a sum of, say, ^2,000  per annum would  be sufficient to meet  the cost,  both  of  the   bureau  and of    reducing the treatise referred to in (b) in the preceding  paragraph.   The initiation of  this  work is so ini-    irtant, and the process of collecting the  existing data  must necesarily be so slow that the Committee think    lit the bureau should be  set up without delay during the  war, accepting the view that  it will  probably be    scessary  to treat the information prepared as confidential, but in the hope that  secret information will in    ie  course  become available  for  the British investigator.      5. As to the publication  of reliable text  books  mentioned in paragraph 3 (b) above, the Committee doubt     Sther this will require Government intervention.  The production of such text books might,  no doubt, be     &quot;t to private  enterprise, but their initiation  is of  great importance and  urgency, and there is danger that,     the absence of an appropriate grant from the Government,  a very long  time would elapse before such  a     future would offer sufficient  inducement to any private individual to make the effort to start it.       6. The foregoing paragraphs  deal with the materials upon which  a certain part of  aeronautical research     m  be based.  There remain  to  be considered the problems of  finding what machinery or organisation shall     irry:on  (a) -teats arid investigation of finished products-aircraft;  engines,  and.-, sundries, and  (b)  further                                                                                                      G                   APPENDIX   VII.Interim and Final  Reports  of Special  Committee  No.  5.
COre         research, including physical, model and full scale.&quot;. The&apos;&apos;Committee desire to emphasise the close associati   ^         of these two different functions of the research organisation, because the proper carrying out of any tests!!8         performance under (a) essentially involves the use of a skilled  staff such as could well be drawn from a bot   cl         engaged in  research of the kind  indicated in (b).  The important question of&quot; tlic certification of the rotitr   w         products of manufacture as distinct from experimental construction, though  closely related to the probMi0&apos;         submitted to the Special Committee,  falls, outside their terms of reference.                                 P1                                                                                                             MM             7. The  Committee appreciate the fact that much useful  research work  is being  done,  and will  be do:   ei         in;.Universities and Technical Institutes,  and they note with satisfaction the recent announcement -that til A         Research Department  have  made a grant to &quot;Professor Bryan,  P.R.S.,  of  the University  College of  Nor&apos;/r         -Wales-, to enable him for a whole session to carry on aeronautical research.   At the same time, they feel ths i         since  it is desirable to  maintain in practice the close connection  between research and test  work, the instill th         tion, for  the benefit of all constructors, of a Central Research  Laboratory is desirable.  Connected with sit   IN         a Laboratory the Committee recommend  the establishment of  a Central Aircraft Test Ground  and Test-ill         Establishment.  The  aim of  the former  would  be  to form a  centre of study of aeronautical problems, at]         the&apos; ami of the latter  to  provide  reliable and impartial test, results  to the constructors and designers of 11         country, whether on their experimental or on their  routine  production.   The Committee  think that  it         essential that the Laboratory  and the Test Ground  should be  combined in  one establishment.             8. At present the Society  of British Aircraft Constructors are considering  the formation of  a Roseau         Association  in conformity with the rules laid down by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research         The proposal to form such an Association has already been approved in principle.  No details of organisatio;         control, or finance are  as yet available; but it is assumed that it will be in receipt of funds contributed by         firms  who are members  of  the Society of British Aircraft Constructors, many of whose individual engines         will also  be represented  as  members of the  Aeronautical Society on the Board of the Research Associatio:             9. It is thought desirable that the Laboratory and the  Testing Establishment should  be in one-&apos;plan!         and the following scheme represents what  the  Committee are prepared  to  recommend in the  light of  tlit         present information :-               I. A  Bureau for the  preparation of the bibliography and  treatise proposed above (paragraphs ii and                  to  be established at the National Physical  Laboratory under the control of, and paid for from Sta:                  funds made available for that Institution.             II. A Central Research Laboratory (see above paragraph 7).             III. A Central Aircraft  Test Ground and Testing  Establishment (see above paragraph 7).         If II.  and III. should be, like 1., under the control of  the  National Physical  Laboratory,  they  should         doubtedly  be established at  some place where there is ample  room for a  ground of adequate  size,  if         on an  existing aerodrome, near a  centre of scientific effort,  such as London.  This is of the essence of         matter, and  makes it impossible to recommend that the establishment should he at Teddington,  where si         cient space is not available.   The funds required for II. and III. should be provided by grants from the Depaf         ment of Scientific and Industrial Research and by contributions  from the industry, which, for this purpose         means the Research Association mentioned above in paragraph  8.   Suitable   fees  might  be  charged [4         individuals for  tests carried  out on their behalf by the Testing  Establishment.  The  results of such t-es  ^         could and should be treated as confidential whenever the individuals on whose behalf they are made desire it.f             10. The importance of meteorology in -the development of aeronautics can hardly  be over-estimated.  Ti         Committee were entrusted  only  with the question  of research  in regard to meteorology,  and  they und( -         stand that the question of the dissemination of meteorological information after it has been obtained, is bcii         dealt with by Special Committee  No. 2.  The problems of meteorological research have been dealt with TAppendicesmemoranda by Major Lyons and Sir  Napier  Shaw,  which are  appended to  this  report (Appendices B afB &amp;Qo&apos;on  C).  In these memoranda the Committee  desire to draw attention to the following pointsp p. 8S, Sy.       \      (a) The  necessity for a closer  study of atmospheric conditions at great heights.             (b) The  investigation of  the phenomena of mist and log and abnormal air currents in special localities.            (c) The necessity for an organised scheme for improving the supply of information  from, the metcoiL                logist to the flyer and  vice versa.                  .                                -v-  &apos;         jm&apos;             (d) The  desirability of preparing meteorological information in a  form  most suitable for  aviators  Man                the  existing material, not only for the United Kingdom, but  for so much of  Europe and for sull                air routes as may be selected.                                                                  VM            11. In the  case of meteorology, it is practically impossible to  divide research proper from the disscmina im        tion of the results of that research.  For this reason the Committee approve of  the conclusions drawn by/,fl:0f j        Napier Shaw in paragraphs 2 and 3 of his memorandum  (Appendix C), and they strongly support the  otlifl na        recommendations contained  in the two memoranda  (Appendices  B and C), which may be summarised]! led        follows :  enofhoth,InraiAr             (a) The necessity for increased facilities for aeronautical research at the Meteorological Office.

It will be observed that the Committee have not dealt with the problem of accident investigation men-ioned in paragraph 1 of this report.   They  are proposing to consider this question with the assistance of amemorandum thereon by Mr. Harper and Captain Hucks.  The Committee^ views on this point and their conclusions as to the special scientific education of expert  designers, engineers,  and pilots,  particularly  inelation to navigation, will be included in a  second report to the Main Committee.

November 17, 1917.                                        FINAL  REPORT.    As stated in the final paragraph of their interim report, the Special Committee propose to deal  in thepresent report  with the subject of accident investigation, being the remaining heading of the branch of theirenquiry relating to Research, and with the second branch of their enquiry, viz., Special scientific education of expert engineers, designers, and pilots.                                      I.  RESEARCH (continued).    15. The investigation of accidents has been considered by the Committee from two points of view, namely,how far such investigation  is necessary in the interests of public safety, and how far it will be of assistance inthe advancement- of aeronautical  research, and in the improvement  of  design,  construction,  and  piloting.In a general view of accident  investigation  the  Committee have been greatly assisted by a detailed memo-randum prepared for their use by  Mr. Harper and Captain   Hucks,  which  is  attached  to  this report  as appendix  E.  This memorandum deals with the subject under  different  heads, and contains  much  usefulAppendixinformation of a technical  character, including a summary  of the work,  prior to the war, of the Public Safety&apos;5&apos; P- 91,and Accidents  Investigation Committee of the Royal Aero Club and Aeronautical Society.    16. There appears to the Committee to be a broad  distinction between accidents occurring  to  aircraftcarrying passengers for hire and those occurring to aircraft  privately  owned and used.  In  the former caseinvestigation of an official nature seems necessary in the interests  of the public  and the analogy is suggestedof the investigation undertaken  by the Railway Department  of the  Board, of Trade of accidents of a seriousnature on  railways.  The Board of Trade enquiries are undertaken by officials possessing a wide expert know-ledge of their subject, and it seems to the Committee that the investigation  in  the case  of aircraft  should similarly be  undertaken either by or with the assistance  of  experts.  The  Committee, therefore, recommendthat all accidents of a serious nature to aircraft  carrying passengers  for hire should  be the subject of anofficial investigation,  and  that power should be  conferred on  the  appropriate   Government  department,whether it be the Board of Trade or the Air Ministry, to  compel such investigation  and  to  regulate themanner in&quot; which it should  be undertaken.  In view of their opinion as to  the necessity of expert  assistance,the Committee further recommend that in carrying out their duties in this respect, the  Government depart-ment should invite the co-operation of the research organisation referred to in their Interim Report.    17. In the case of accidents to aircraft privately owned and used it appears to the Committee that investi-jation  should not be made  a matter of compulsion. The information obtained therefrom may,  however,  be  the greatest assistance in the  advancement of aeronautical knowledge,  and should be regarded as  an aid to research generally.   Before the war the Public Safety  and Accidents Investigation Committee of the RoyalAero Club and Aeronautical Society were able,  without  possessing any  compulsory powers, to obtain muchuseful information  as  to the causes  and prevention of accidents.  The Committee  recommend that after thewar steps should be taken to ensure  the continuance of this or a  similar Committee to carry on the work of investigation of accidents other  than those referred to in paragraph  16, and that such Committee should co-operate with the research organisation in furnishing to them the data obtained in their investigations.                                                                                                    H
o-VC8er                                           II.  EDUCATION.                                            ,    18. The modifications in the conditions of civil life introduced  by  new  inventions have  in  the  pasfceifollowed a  gradual  development.   Progress  in  design and construction has resulted from experience gainedj  woin everyday use.  Rail and road transport are but  two illustrations of this process.   Aerial transport willHReprobably form a unique exception to the rule. The aeronautical  industry  was in its infancy when the warpstarted, and, when peace is declared, will  find itself grown up with the advantage of a great body of accumij]lated  knowledge.  This knowledge will  have been acquired solely from the military  use  of aircraft,  and maynot be immediately applicable in all respects to the problems of civil aeronautics.  Some period of time willMwino doubt, have to be devoted to the design of purely commercial  machines.  Nevertheless,  there is every reasoJpsrto expect that the industry will be in a position to meet efficiently and adequately the urgent demand for moitHMrapid transit,  and that aerial transport will pass, though not without an awkward  transition stage, into thej308routine of civil life.    19.  The requirements of military  aeronautics will by no means cease with the war.  The country hasj CXcno  doubt realised that safety requires  the maintenance of two  fleets, and the  necessity of shouldering the! jnsfinancial burden involved in the maintenance of  an  efficient aerial  navy.  We may, therefore, conclude thatBed,aeronautical construction will,  whether measured  by the capital invested or the labour employed, eventually: reGrank  among our most  important industries.  The prosperity  of an industry depends in the first  instance on  0X[the demand for its products, and in the long run on the efficiency  of the production; it  is first stimulated byFnational requirements, later on by international competition.  Where the  manufacture is a matter  of old-established  routine and custom, its rise or fall is slow, but rapid where sound scientific knowledge  and hightechnical skill are essential.     20.  We are thus led to the conclusion  that the demand  for  the best training  in aeronautics is urgent,and that, including  all classes, from the skilled artisan to the scientifically trained engineer,  and  from theair mechanic  to the pilot working on international lines of communication, the numbers of men to be  trainedwill be considerable.  At the present moment the  war has emptied the Universities and Technical Colleges,and consequently &quot;there is no supply of men whose scientific  education and engineering training would other-wise  have been in progress or in course of completion.  The recommendations which follow should, thereforebe  read  as  applicable to a  future period when the  disturbance caused by the war, particularly in educationalprogress, has ceased.                                         Engineers and Designers.     21.  It  is not proposed to deal here with the training  of the mechanics or artisans,  who, of course, formnumerically the largest portion of the total; this  matter has been referred to another Special Committee. their training will  doubtless entail  the  formation of  special classes at  the principal technical schools, more especi-ally at those situated in the neighbourhood of important works or  aerodromes.   At  these  institutions classeswill also be organised suitable for engineers and draughtsmen who wish  to improve their theoretical  know-fledge while engaged in practical work.  On the other hand the engineering schools at most Universities willBdoubtless recognise  that, just as under present  circumstances the education of  a mechanical engineer is  in- pricomplete without some general knowledge of electrical engineering,  so, in future,  all engineers  should have hitat  least  a superficial knowledge of aeronautical  engineering.  For the civil engineer it will offer some instruc-tive instances in the study  of structural design,  and some reference to aeronautical engines will necessarilyform part of any mechanical engineering course.     22.  The  least numerous, but not  the least  important, class to be provided  for is that which  includes  themen  who, in  due course, will direct research,.design, and  construction.  Aeronautical engineers must,  in  the first  instance, be fully qualified mechanical engineers, having  had  a  sound,   practical  and  an  advanced&apos;4theoretical training.  They should, in addition, have had an  opportunity  of devoting adequate  time to  the scientific study of aeronautics, and be  familiar with the details of aircraft  design  and  construction.   It is evident  that the period of study will be longer,  and the test  of ability more stringent,  than in  many other branches of the engineering  profession.     23. The  Universities provide courses in Mechanical Engineering  which  extend over three years.  Such !courses  would form a satisfactory preliminary to the more specialised training.   During this period the student-intending to specialise in aeronautics would spend his long vacation in  aircraft works, and thus acquire somepractical knowledge.   The fourth year would be devoted  entirely to specialised study, and would be followedby one or two years&apos; experience in works, including a period in  the drawing office and a period on an aero-drome.  After such a training the student would be fitted for a position  of some responsibility, and  shouldhave  a  reasonable prospect  of  rising,  in  due course, to the top of his profession as a  consulting engineer, amanaging-director,  a chief engineer, chief designer, or chief draughtsman.     24. As outlined above, the specialised  training of the aeronautical engineer would be a post-graduate course,and the question arises as to the nature of the institutions at  which such courses should be organised.  It hasalready  been pointed out that whatever the devolopment of the industry may be, the number of posts  suitablefor men of the highest standard  of training is necessarily  limited, and it  is equally obvious  that  menpossessing  the combination  of theoretical aptitude  and practical ability required to profit by such  a  training are not numerous.  Before the war the total yearly number  of honours graduates in engineering, including civil,mechanical, electrical  engineering, and naval architecture, etc., from all the Universities in the United King- dom averaged about two hundred.     25. It would appear, therefore, that  one or two institutions could deal with the demand which will arise for the highest specialised training  in aeronautical engineering.   Such an  institution  should certainly exist in the London district, and one in the  North of  England or in Scotland would probably also be required.  TMJ London school might either be :-                                                                     -  i      (a) Attached to the Imperial College, where the students would have the advantage of coming in contact         with the members of a distinguished teaching staff, and could conveniently make use of  many of the         existing laboratories; or      (b) it  might be attached to some  research and testing institution,  established  on an ^aerodrome,  and, in         connection with its educational work, be recognised by the University of London&quot;
218 the school were attached to the Imperial College/the buildings  might  be  situated on  the ground  of  theentral Research  Laboratory suggested  in  paragraph 9 of our  interim report.   Those attending the schoolould then be under  the  Imperial  College  for all  purposes of teaching, but would have access to the Centralesearch  Laboratory for the  purpose of studying experimental work.  Such an arrangement would involve^operation between the bodies named, the student dividing his  time between the two.  26. There &quot;are, of course, men  who could ill afford the considerable expense involved by so  prolonged a;period of training.  An adequate system of scholarships, financed by the Board of Education, should be estal)-jhed, so that no student of exceptional ability need abandon his studies through  the want of the necessarysiancia] resources.   On the other hand, many  men likely  to prove of great value to  the industry may  notjssess the necessary aptitude or the inclination to carry their  theoretical studies&apos; to the highest point.  27. The system of  education should be sufficiently flexible to  provide  for  the  full  development of  anyiceptional ability in whatever direction it may be.   In the present case it would be desirable for the Centralistitution recommended in paragraph 25 also to provide courses  based on  a sound general engineering  know-h,ei.   Men  attending these courses would presumably be required  to have  studied for two years at some  promised institution,  either a University or a higher  Technical  School,  and  to  have  had  some   worksidgeicogcperience.      The establishment of such an Institution would involve a  considerable expenditure of  capital.  No such   istitution is  self-supporting, the fees forming usually but a small proportion of the total expenditure.   A   early sum of about  6,000 would be required.                                       Training of Flyers and Pilots.      28. It is not possible to outline a scheme for the training of civil flyers and pilots without first considering   iefly the new conditions  which will follow any extended adoption of aircraft for transport work.      It may be assumed that, apart from naval and military aircraft, two classes of aircraft will exist:       (a) Those owned by companies which will maintain  passenger  or despatch services, or be chartered  fo*         special journeys.      (b) Those owned by private individuals, which will occupy a  position between the yacht used exclusively         for pleasure and exploration and the private motor car  used  for pleasure and business.   hese will naturally be employed on various services which may be sub-divided into :-      (i.) Local.      (ii.) National.      (hi.) International.     29. Before the war there were in this country some five thousand yachts and  several  hundred  thousand   rivate cars. With regard to numbers, the privately-owned aircraft may eventually be  expected  to  reach  an   itermediate place.  In many cases the owner will qualify as a flyer, and some of his employees will, presumably,   e primarily expected  to look after the upkeep of the machine,  but will doubtless be required to be capable   &apos; flying it also.  The owner&apos;s training will depend on  the  time  he devotes to it, and his desire to excel in it.   o  definite rules  can be laid down for his training; but we can assume that a considerable number of pupils   this kind will present  themselves at the various training grounds.     30. Those who adopt flying  as an employment (apart from a few amateurs, who might receive a nominal   muneration,  and would expect to be provided with a  staff of mechanics to keep the machine in order) will   robably be drawn from two classes :-     (a)  The professional  flyer, who will receive a substantial remuneration, and will be the responsible super-         visor  of a staff who will attend to mechanical matters;     (b)  The chauffeur-flyer, who  will be expected to clean and repair the  machine,  and be capable of flying         it when required.   hese classes will, no doubt, hold a certificate awarded on the successful  completion of some prescribed course   tuition  in flying.  The  chauffeur-flyer will,  in  addition, be required to possess the qualifications of a skilled   techanic, and in the event of such a flyer taking  charge  of passenger aircraft plying  for hire, there will  be   iiecial obligatory tests of qualification to ensure adequate, protection for the public.     31.  The three classes  of commercial  transport will call for men of different training :-     (a)  For local transport, proficiency in flying and knowledge  of  the rules of the air and of agreed signals         will be essential  qualifications.     (b)  For  national transport, involving  long journeys in  the  United Kingdom,  e.g.,  from  London  to         Glasgow,  a knowledge of map-reading and some knowledge of meteorology will be necessary  as         additional qualifications.     (c)  For most international  transport routes  a knowledge of  navigation and a more complete knowledge         of meteorology will be required, in addition to the qualifications mentioned in (a) and (b).     It is indispensable in all cases that there should be  a  proper   understanding of  all  the  instruments  mployed and of the elements of the scientific reasons for  their use.aL  It is probable that aircraft used on international lines of communication will eventually  be of large  size.&quot;this case the man at the controls becomes the helmsman, and  the craft is under the command of  a captain   pilot. Mutatis mutandis, the training required for  this  post  is that received by the navigating officer of a  tier.  An appreciation of the functions of wireless telegraphy will also be needed.  32. The above forecast appears to indicate that a large number oi schools will be required for  tuition inying, whether or not special flying certificates are sought.   Presumably most mam aerodromes will have afing school attached.  The object of the tuition in such schools  has in the past been to reach the standard
set by the certificate* of the Royal Aero Club, and the Committee consider that there would be advantages in continuing this system.                                            :     33. In  addition, at least one school of aerial navigation will be required, at which, amongst other neces.sary  subjects, map reading, the  use of the  compass, astronomy, signalling, and wireless telegraphy andmeteorology will be taught.     34. The standard required for the  flying certificate should be reached after a few months&apos; training in ataerodrome.   It would imply the ability to  fly any usual type of machine, and a  number of extended  cross.country flights would be required.  It  would not imply any special engineering  training, but  merely  theknowledge  required to verify the adjustment of the rigging, to start and  control the engine satisfactorily, amto adjust and replace valves and minor  fittings.   The courses at the school of navigation would extend oveione  year, at the end of which time the students would be required to pass  an examination  in the subjectstaught.  The training in navigation could  not, however, be regarded as complete until the student could giviproof of continuous and satisfactory practical experience extending over a period of time.     * The term &quot;flying certificate&quot; is probably more appropriate than &quot; pilot&apos;s certificate,&quot; when flying alone has formed tho objectof tuition.      t I doubt whether tbe power to order official investigation of  accidents should be limited, as is proposed, to cases wherethe aircraft is carrying passengers for hire, and whether higher educational facilities should be limited to one or two institutionsas is proposed.

219                  Report  on  the  Preparation  i  At tho Juno meeting of tho Committee, a Panel, consistingof Major Taylor, Professor Petavel, Mr.  Berriman, and Mr.Selby was  appointed to  draw  up  some suggestions  for atreatise on aeronautics, to give  effect to Professor Petavel&apos;proposal No. 3.  The main purpose of such a treatise  wouldbe to put in a convenient form the present results of scientificinquiry  into aeronautics.  The  material  for such a treatisewould be found  in the  Technical  Reports  of tho AdvisoryCommittee for Aeronautics,  the publications  of  M,  Eiffel,and  the papers issued from the Aeronautical Institutes  atGottingen, Koutchino,  and  elsewhere.    Other  importantsources of supply will be the Transactions of the AeronauticalSociety, the various technical journals, &quot;English and foreign,and existing books.  Such  a treatise would  be the work of various writers; thefirst  step would be to  find an editor, who would, no  doubt,write some parts of the  book himself, but whose main work would be to obtain and edit  the various contributions  whichwould go to compose the treatise.  If  a  scheme for issuing abstracts is  developed, it  might perhaps be arranged that the same man should act as  editorfor this, but that ought not to be looked upon as essential.f  an  Aeronautical  Treatise,   Somo.estimate of the time required and tho funds necessary to pay  the editor and staff  must be formed.  It is  difficult to do this with any- completeness until tho  editor has been provisionally selected, and some scheme for the contents  of the book has been approved.  Some portion, at any  rate,  of the cost ought to be recovered from the sale of the  book.   It would, no doubt, be desirable for the Sub-Committee  to indicate the name of a possible editor,  to make some sugges- tion as to the remuneration he  should  receive, and, if pos- sible, to frame an estimate of the time required to write the ibook, but  under present war  conditions it has not proved feasible  to do this.  The  Sub-Committee, however,  have reason to hope that  Mr.  Bairstow would undertake the duty on the  conclusion of peace, or failing this, we may look for assistance  as editor  from Mr. Selby.   Mr. Selby has prepared a schedule of the suggested con- &apos;tents of the Report, as an indication of what the Committee have  in view,  not with  the  intention  of settling its future contents now;  this  must bo  loft to  the editor.

Memorandum on  Research  in  Regard to Meteorology.    The increase of aviation  which will bo  brought about by  tho introduction of aorial transport on a commercial basis  will greatly enlarge tho demands made upon both practical  and theoretical meteorology, in order that tho dangers and  obstacles due to meteorological conditions may  be reduced  so far as may bo practicable.    These  demands must bo met  by both special investigations  into various meteorological problems, and the provision, in  forms  suitable to the  needs of aviation,  of tho information  which  has been accumulated during more than half  a ccn-  tury of co-operative effort.    Modern meteorology has  been  built  up  on  tho  study  of tho physics of the  atmosphere, and further  advance will  be attained by the same method.  The investigation of such  phenomena as the formation  of mist and  fog,  conditions  which  affect visibility,  turbulence in tho lower strata  of the  atmosphere,  which are already being studied,  are typos of  the  work required, and other problems  will doubtless be  suggested at the meetings of this Committee.  The Central  Institute, tho Meteorological  Office, and  its Observatories,  will naturally be largely occupied with this form of research,  but  it may  be  assumed that, as jioon as the universities  provide  facilities  for  the  study of  advanced meteorology,  such investigations will be undertaken  there also.   Weather changes, forecasts, and   warnings can only be  adequately  studied at the  Central  Institute, where  large-  scale working maps are prepared regularly, at which data  are received  several times  daily  and where a very complete  collection of  meteorological data from all countries is  avail-  able for  comparison study,  so  that the practicability  of ex-  tending  the period for which weather changes can be fore-  told must be undertaken there.    The  study  of  the  special features of  the  weather in localities where winds  of exceptional violence, great turbu-&apos; lence of  air currents  or other abnormal phenomena  occur, will  be important, and this will necessitate  a  scheme of suitably  planned observations  taken on the  spot, together with their critical discussion by competent meteorologists.   While  pure research, the  investigation  of phenomena under well defined conditions will always go on more or less steadily,  provision must be made for tho further study of the phenomena under various  meteorological conditions to determine  the modifications which  may  be  caused.   This extension of the work is essential in  order that the results of meteorological research may be of practical utility.   Intimately connected with  such  investigations arc  the collection and discussion of the material  on which they are based.  Observations of pressure, wind, temperature, rain- fall, fog, &amp;c., have been accumulated for  many years past, but both thoso of this country  and  those from many  places abroad will  require re-discussion in order to provide the special  kind of information which is now required,  and  which differs  from that which is used for climatic studies.  Obser- vations of the upper air havo become very numerous and are constantly increasing;  they, too, have to be compiled and prepared for ready reference. In this field particularly a closer connection between the practical experiences of the pilot and the investigations  of the scientific meteorologist is most desirable, for what is  a matter of common knowledge to the one may provide confirmatory evidence for  which the other has been vainly seeking.   The present supply of data from ships will need increasing where routes cross tho sea, in order that tho information availablo on land may bo extended  to  tho sea  area will confidence; and to this will now bo added the observation; made or obtained by aviators during  their flights.  To con. bine these satisfactorily with  those representing the condi. tions over neighbouring areas  will require tho same careful organisation as was necessary  for marine observations wiiot wireless telegraphy was first introduced,  for incorrect obset rations or data obtained by faulty instruments lead to false conclusions  which may not be merely  useless,  but ever dangerous.   The incorporation,  discussion or  recasting, as  may h necessary,, of tho meteorological data of  foreign  countries as it becomes available, will also be  an  important duty oi tho Central  Institute.   The speed  of modern aircraft moving along air  routes wil presumably necessitate some rearrangement in the prevision of forecasts  and weather warnings.    While the Centra; Institute will receive  reports  from a very wido area ant deduce from them the probable changes  which will occur, s well-selected  network  of  secondary  station?  will  also bt necessary.   These  stations will  receive,  besides  their  ov\ observations, reports from the  Central Institute  and other stations,  which will enable them to prepare a weather-maj of their district and to follow  the iweather changes over i: in greater detail than at the Central Institute. They woulc be ready to furnish short-period forecasts or warnings b aviators in the district or on tho section of a route passing near it.  Thus tho necessary  organisation will  include ;- (a) Central Institute; (b) Local Warning  Stations; (c) nume- rolls Observing Stations, besides certain Institutes.   The Central Institute is represented by the Meteorological Office, with its observatories, where phenomena can be invcj tigated and  tho  results brought into  touch with the  prac- tical application of Meteorology, and the existence of sis observatories dependent on  the  Meteorological Office  in different parts of Great Britain provides largo opportunities for such  work. At the Meteorological Office also the  accumu- lated observations of over sixty years from many stations at home and abroad, which have been tabulated and discussed, provide a trich store of material ready for the investigation of  special subjects, and the preparation  of new data could be economically met by an extension of the present arrange- ments.   The Forecasting service  will probably have to be arranged on the basis of continuous duty, so  that  inquiries can be dealt with at any  time, and, ibesides  the general forecasts issued at fixed hours, the Forecast Service  should telegraph sufficient meteorological data to Local Warning Stations to enable them  to follow the  weather conditions of  their dis- tricts and to give warnings of  disturbances likely to affect them.  The  connection  between  Meteorological Research and practical  Aviation could  bo  facilitated  at  aeronautical research Centres,  Avhere a trained meteorologist  could not only contribute his own observations, but also  bring thepractical experience of pilots to the knowledge of meteorolo-gists, and demonstrate the bearing  of advances in  meteor-ology on aeronautics.

220                     Meteorological  Otlice,                               South Kensington,                                        London, S.W.7.                                11th August, 1917. P. 0. Malcolm, Esq.,         Civil Aerial Transport Committee. Dear Sir,   In reply to your letter of August 4th, 1  quite agree with the lines of  Major Lyons&apos; Memorandum of 27th July,  1917. 1 should add to  the preamble some words about taking ad- vantago of favourable  meteorological conditions  as well as &quot; reducing the dangers and obstacles &quot; of unfavourable ones, because, on  the  whole, the weather is  beneficent, and  its favourable moods are as well worth considering as its  occa- sional ill-tempers.  That, however,  is  merely a  matter of form.   2. In substance, 1 gather,  Major Lyons suggests an exten- sion of the present public meteorological service to meet the special and local needs of a regular  service of aerial trans- port.  A  public  meteorological  service is  essentially  an organised  &quot; enquire  within &quot;  upon all  questions  in which  le weather  is concerned,   It must bo prepared on demand to supply an answer to  any question about tho weather  past; present or future, in any part of the world to which, in the present  stato of our knowledge,  an answer can bo given. It  must,  therefore, have all its information and its icnow-  edgo  ready in advance  before  it knows what question is going  to be asked.  Wo are quite used  to that situation so far  as surface weather is concerned.  The  underlying prin- ciples  of  .the present scheme of tho meteorological service are:  (1) The collection and organised arrangement of trustworthy     information  about  past  weather  from every part of the     globe. (2) The periodical  notification by  telegraph  of the present     weather  from stations representing  as  wide an area as     possible  surrounding the United  Kingdom,  to  form, the     basis of maps upon which forecasts of weather aro based     in accordance with  the recognised teachings of nieteoro-     logical science. (3) The distribution of  the information so collected either in     summary or  detail in  reply to specific enquiries or in     anticipation of enquiries in common form. (4) The study of the information  collected  in  conjunction     Avith that obtained  at   the  special  observatories  and     stations of the Office in order to improve, by  investiga-     tion  and research,  the position of the Office in relation     to replies to  enquiries of every kind.  3. The  new features introduced by   he  needs  of aerial transport are, first, that the subject of possible questions is extended  to  include  the  atmosphere up to  20,000 feet,  a region that, until recently, we have studied only for the  light that it throws upon meteorological science;  secondly,  that the  scientific questions  that  arise are rather more recondite Mid require  more specific answers  than   those which  have commonly been addressed to us from outside the Office in the last; and, thirdly, that the airman&apos;s horizontal   range  is wider: he needs to  draw upon information from a wider area, and to have the information at his disposal in a  com- ?endious form practically  at  any aerodrome and at any  time of the day or night.  In other words, there must be provision for studying  the  structure and properties of the atmosphere from the  special  point  of  view of aircraft, which involves some extension of our organisation for  study and  research, and for obtaining the material necessary  for that study; and there must be some extension of our means of communicating general and  special  information  to thoso  interested  in aircraft.  4. What Major Lyons obviously realises is that  the provi-sion for conveying information to aircraft pilots is not com- plete unless the pilot has an opportunity of  discussing the situation with a  meteorological expert,  by which I do not mean an inspired weather-prophet who  makes an oracularstatement that enables the pilot to dismiss the weather from lis thoughts, but  simply an educated person who knows what information weather maps do, and do not, contain, and what it means; what additional information is  available and where and how  it is to bo found.  In fact, a pilot wants  access to   &apos; map room,&quot; where he can consult a weather map just as le would consult a topographical  map;  but as the weathermap is changeable from day  to day, and even from hour  to lour, it cannot be drawn once and for all and carried in the locket on a long journey; it must be redrawn periodically on**he spot, and the person who drew  it  should be  there  to xplain its meaning.     At present the only public provision for consultation  ofthis  kind is at the Meteorological Office  in  London.  Manyuseful  consultations with  balloonists have been held  there,but  that  is  not  sufficient  for  regular aerial  transport.Adequate information of the same kind  is wanted in other&quot;ocalities.    The  recognised   provision at present  for other places is to send a copy  of tho Daily Weather  Report, whichis then somewhat belated, and lias generally  to be read with-lut the advantage of  an expert to consult.  The alternative to posting or delivering  the Daily Weather Report is to make a reply to a delinite question sent by telegraph; but oue ques- tion and one answer are liisumcient,  everyuue wants to ask further  questions in  case  tlie answer to tlie  nist is not exhaustive, as it seldom is.   0. Assuming  tliat aerouromes will  bo connected by tele- phone With what, on uie analogy oi runways, may lie caned V termini,&apos;&apos; an envious step  \vouiu  ho  to have io.ai luotuoro- iogicai eotaoiisimieiiis at tuosc termini,  such as j^uniuurgh or  Ulusgow, Liverpool, ouuiin, i^uocnsunvn, oardui, riy- niouth, and,  perxiaps,  ouier  places.   r^ach establishment suouici consist  oi  a &quot; map  room &quot; in charge oi an  expert, who would Keep a suitaoio  Horary oi merenee ana \*oulu discuss tno meteorological situation oraliy  or over the the- phone with pilots and others.   These experts  should  tie actaclied to the stall of tne Meteorological Oiuce  and take regular turns oi duty, at the Umce, so  that they may  be Kept quite up to date both as to  inrormation  and methods,  liiacii expert would require a junior as learner, or two lr the station is to bo open continuously.   These are  tae Local  Warning btations which Major Lyons enumerates  under [b).  The men to  De  employed on these posts should  be  men with ample knowledge   and practice  or  mathematics and physics, who have had  a regular course of training  at  a University or Technical Institute.  7. Provision oi this kind is necessary in the public interest, not only for the information of airmen, but also for all the many  classes  of the  community who  are interested  in  an adequate knowledge of the ways of the weather as anecting, c.(/., shipping   and other forms  of  transport agriculture-and horticulture and catering.  It has  already been uncler- taiten  by  the  Office for  the Air Services  at South Jbarn- borough  and for the Armies in iranee  and Salonika. The principal diriicuity that has  had to be met is the lacK of men with suitable training.  When the war began there were not more than  twenty all told on the  Oltice  establishments. 8ome fifty  more have been passed through the Ultice  lor the meteorological service of tho Armies, ana many ot these will be available alter  the  war.  8. Another dilterent but equally important part of the pro- gramme is  the instruction ot pilots and others in tne methods of modern   meteorology, carried suthciently tar  for them to know; the kind of question to wheh meteorological science can give an answer, so  that they may not find themselves at cross- purposes in consultation with a meteorological expert.  This requires the preparation  of  suitable oihcial  handoooks, and some provision by way of lectures or teaching for  discussing the contents with  the airmen,   lt seems important that the handbooks  should  be official,  because  they should be guides to the  use of official intelligence, and that object wants to be kept steadily in view;  but  it will require some pressure on the Meteorologcal  Office to get handbooks prepared, because when a subject is  developing daily under one&apos;s own hands it is very difficult to  shut off and stereotype one&apos;s knowledge in a book. In a university or technical institute there are lolng vacations when other work is shut down, but in an office the increase  of information  goes on  continuously, and  to tho writer the   work gets out of  date  while it is in his hands. Still, it is  important that this work should be  done by the Office Staff.  9. There  remain what  Major Lyons  calls &quot; aeronautical research centres.&quot;  It would bo natural  that these should be organised in connection with courses of  aeronautical engineer&apos; iug and  aeronautical  theory  at teaching centres universities- ties  or technical  institutes.  The aeronautical researchers should, somehow or other,  be in close communication with the aviators, but a much-frequented aerodrome  in the highway of aerial traffic is not a  good place for meteorological ap- paratus that has  to project a  considerable way  from  the ground, or that uses  steel wire,  as for kites and captiveballoons, so the communication is best arranged through  a teaching centre which is common ground.    Moreover, thedirection of experimental researches  in the physics anddynamics of the atmosphere requires  not only high  profes-sional  qualifications, but  also  the  assistance of a body  of students with a good deal of available time.  10. I have set these things out at length in order  to leadup to the vital question of your letter;  by what means theCivil Aerial Transport Committee could best assist in seeing that Major Lyons&apos; suggestions should  be carried out.  Thebest means  seem to me to be, first, to ask the MeteorologicalCommittee,  which  has  the requisite experience, to set up byway of experiment at one of the terminals mentioned a localmeteorological establishment of this kind which I have indi-cated herein as necessary for the purpose  which  the Corn-Cardiff, Southampton and Plymouth, to set up a teachingcentre for Aeronautical Engineering, Aeronautical Theoryand  the structure of the atmosphere; or perhaps a circularprepared by tlie Committee asking universities and technicalinstitutes to make a point of giving students the opportunityof learning those subjects which would lead to the provision which i,s  required.

My  Committeo have  read with very  great  interest your letter  of  the 11th August,  and  are very  much  obliged to you indeed for the useful suggestions it contains.  I note what you state in paragraph 7, that the requisite provision of a map room, with experts in attendance and available for consultation,  has been  undertaken for the Air Services  at South i&apos; arnborough.  Could you let  me know whether  tho establishment  at  South Farnborough is  of the character which  j&apos;ou suggest in paragraph 10 should be set up at one ofthe aerial termini referred to in paragraph 0,  viz.,  Edin- burgh or Glasgow, Liverpool, Dublin,  Queenstown, Cardiff or Plymouth?  In other words, can  the establishment now  in being at South Farnborough be taken to be a practical experi- ment in tho use of an establishment such as you suggest;  or would  it be advisable at once to try the experiment in one ofthe other places you mention, or perhaps at Hendon, where the aerodrome could probably be easily connected by a special wire with the Meteorological Office in South Kensington?   I think  it would be of great  interest to the Committee if wo could  be furnished with  a detailed description of the estab- lishment  in existence at  South Farnborough, together with a detailed plan for  an  establishment at one of  the  other places mentioned, or at Hendon, which could be  sot up now if you consider that what had already been done in South Farnborough is not sufficient by way  of experiment.                              (Signed)  D.  0.  MALCOLM.  In reply to your letter of  August 18th, our present branch establishment at  South  Farnborough was  intended, in the first instance, to  be exactly the kind of establishment that I had in mind for tho aerial termini.  It was, indeed, set up with exactly similar objects in view,  namely, to  provide all the various units of the  Royal  Flying Corpa at South Farn- borough with current information  about the weather, supply and discuss with airmen  the map and any other information required.  But a combination of circumstances has made it now a kind of compromise between an establishment of that kind and an&quot; aeronautical  research centre &quot; for the experi- mental work  in meteorology for the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.  The normal staff of the Branch Office at South Farnborough is:-  &apos;        -  A  meteorologist-in-charge,          a professional assistant,  .&apos;.   .   a mechanic, !&apos; a clerk. The quarters are three rooms in the Roval Aircraft Factory&apos;(a  workshop,  an  observatory  room, arid a  staff  room),  the roof and  a square of grass in the grounds of the R.A.F.   For the &quot; map  room &quot; establishment of a terminal aetj. drome a mechanic is not required, but if attendance is to btcontinuous a third professional man or an  experienced clerk would be required.   When I was writing my letter of the 11th August, I made the  following note of rough  estimate for a local  meteorc. logical  establishment at a terminal aerodrome :    Staff. Meteprolegist-in-charge   .........   350 a year.         Professional assistant (senior) ...   225  300                             (junior)               or senior clerk...............    150- 225         Attendant or clerk..................    100         Cleaner or charwoman ............    25 Sorvice day  and night:  Holidays  and emergencies supplied from Meteorological Office.   Apparatus. Tho ordinary equipment of  a weather-statioi  Barograph, Thermograph, Hygrograph, a camera-obscun, Pilot-balloon equipment.  The aerodrome would want  an  anemograph, but  ft is ti oasy to get a suitable exposure.   Manifolding or  lithographic apparatus  for  duplicate charts for distribution in the  locality.   Quarters. Two  rooms: a map-room and a working offe and a square of grass for exposed instruments.   Supposing the aerodrome  to be outside a great city, a; would probably be the case,  for the other purposes  of til establishment a single room  with  telephone and  attendant! in the business part of the city would be required for the sail of books,  charts, etc., and as a local centre  of  informatia about the weather.   The time of the professional meteorologist, when not en- gaged in  receiving information,   preparing  or  explaining maps, would be devoted to preparing summaries and compf ing text books or the material necessary for them.  It won! be desirable to arrange for  the meteorologist-in-charge it give lectures in explanation of methods and summaries, and to be allowed and encouraged  to augment his income in tki way.   It is  difficult at  present to make a trial of  an establisl ment of this kind unless it is directly under naval or militt control, because the supply of  information about the weatk is contraband.  Also I have no margin of staff at present till I could detail for  the  purpose, so that we  should have i depend upon men already in the Services or otherwise at tl disposal of the military authorities.  Hendon is close enotr to London to be worked from the Central Office by charts an telephones,  though probably a &quot; map-room &quot; there  would found very useful.   If it was thought well that  the expeii ment should be made, one of the naval bases would probal be the best locality.                                 (Signed)  NAKKR SHAW.
221Memorandum by  Captain B. C.  Hucks,  R.A.F.,  and  the Assistant  Secretary  (Technical),    as  to  Accidents and Accident Investigation, with  an  Annex  Summarising the  Work,    Prior  to the War,  of  the Public Safety and Accidents  Investigation Committee of  the    Royal Aero Club  and  Aeronautical  Society.It is proposed to  deal with tho subject under  tho  following heads:    i An outline of  the most common forms of accident at the     present time. II The necessity for an  investigation of  accidents,  even     some  of those not  having serious results, with  a  view     to the determination of their causes.Ill Methods of  obtaining reliable information.IV The  necessity  for an expert  examination and  dassifica-     tion of data obtained. V The use to which the results  of examination can be put.               CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS.   Aeroplane accidents are,  as a rule, due  to one or other of the following causes, or sometimes to a  combination of such causes:    A. Engine stoppage,  etc.   B. Errors in Piloting.  1. Want of experience  and hur-       ried  teaching.  2. Real  errors of  judgment.   3.        Rashness.   C. Faulty  construction.   1. Design.   2. Construction.       3. Materials.   D. Dangerous manoeuvres.   E. Meteorological conditions.   F. Fires.   6. Illness of a pilot while in flight.   Before examining very briefly some of  the accidents due to one or other of these causes, or a combination of any of them, it should be noted that, with  pilots who are  fully  experi- experienced and know their engines,  grounds, winds and weather signs, accidents  under  the  peace conditions  of flying should become rare. .1.  Engine  Stoppage, etc.   The stoppage  of an  engine in  the air  should not,  under favourable  circumstances, imply any serious risk of accident. His  mechanical  power gone,  the  flyer  must necessarily descend.  He can and  must maintain the forward speed of his machine and the support of its planes, by  gliding down- ward in  a  gradually descending path; but  if he  is  over thickly-wooded, broken, or  mountainous country, it may be difficult for him to find a suitable landing point, and he may, should he make his contact with bad ground,  break  some portion of his  alighting gear, or perhaps damage his machine more seriously.  But if he  is dexterous he may, and  usually does, save himself and his  passengers from serious injury.   To many  flyers the sudden stoppage of their engine is dis- concerting, leading them to errors of judgment they would not be guilty of  under normal conditions.  So ii may happen that at a moment when exceptional judgment is demanded of  him, a flyer is not in a condition to act  correctly and with unswerving precision.   When his engine has  failed a flyers first thought, naturally, is to make a  descent  at  some point where the ground  is suitable,  and where he will avoid damaging his machine, or injuring  himself  or his passengers.  If  he is  near an aero- drome he will  endeavour to reach this aerodrome.  It has in the past happened not infrequently that an engine has failed -say through some disorganisation in&quot; the petrol pressure feed as a result of &quot; taxying &quot;  a machine prior to a flight not long after  a machine has left the  ground and before it has gained altitude.  The instinct of the flyer under such condi- tions is to endeavour to turn his machine in the air and glide back to the aerodrome  rather than make  a landing in any field or open space which may lie within reach.   But while in the act of  turning remembering that he has been more or less disconcerted by the sudden failure of his motor,  and remembering also that owing to the rapid growth of the art of  flying thoroughly  experienced  pilots  are  few he may make the mistake of gliding at so flat an angle while on the turn that  the  air  pressure under the  inner  wing  of  his machine  falls so low that it is insufficient  for the support of that side of the  machine;  whereupon the aeroplane begins a side-slip which may turn into a spinning nose-dive and this means that, for the moment at any rate, the craft has passed bevoml the fflyer&apos;s control.  If, however, he  is  at a sufficientf altitude when  this happens, he may  be  able to extricate the aeroplane from its spinning dive; but.should he be near the ground when his machine side-slips he will probably be unable to regain control before it crashes/       BY MAJOR G. I. TAYLOR.   &quot; Many accidents occur when an engine stops shortly after a   It  would  be  safer  in some  cases after  an  engine  has failed,  and  particularly when  failure takes  place  with the  aeroplane  at  a  low   altitude,  if flyers  glided  onstraight  ahead  and   did  not  endeavour  to  turn.  This-might,   it  is   true,   involve  a  descent on  unsuitableground,  with some slight damage,  perhaps,  to the under-carriage,  but this would be  far  better than losing controlaltogether.  A fact to  be remembered is that if  an aeroplaneloses  flying speed  while  moving straight ahead it  not only loses height less rapidiy, but there is far loss risk of a side-slip, as all stable machines tend, when the flying  speed  is reduced  below a certain point,  to take up  automatically asafe gliding angle.   Probably the  origin of the majority of accidents at thepresent time is stoppage of the engine, after which a flyer is frequently guilty of some error of judgment, or  of pilot- ing, or of both; and such errors are due in most cases to the anxiety of tho flyer to reach sonic specific landing ground  an anxiety which  will be all  the more acuto should enginefailure have occurred when the machine is low.   This points to the fact that when airways are established, with landing grounds fairly close together along each route, the main cause of accidents will have been removed. Under such  improved conditions,  should an  engine  fail   while an aeroplane is in flight, an aviator will not find it necessary  to turn  and manoeuvre in the  air, during  a  glide  without motive power, in order to reach some landing ground that is not  readily accessible.  Subject  to his being at a  sufficient altitude, he will be able to glide to whichever&apos;alighting place on the chain  of  grounds may lie before him,  and make a landing under favourable conditions on a sufficiently smoothground.   Even with  such landing places  available, an engine may fail so soon after a pilot has left  the ground that he isi unable to reach  the  next alighting  point, though this may be only a  few miles  distant.  Under such  conditions,  assuming he has insufficient altitude at which to  make a safe  turn, heshould glide down in the open country and pick the best land-ing he can.  It is worth while,  therefore,, to bear this con- contingency  in mind, and to see that the land is fairly open  in the immediate vicinity of aerodromes.   Improved reliability of engines, and the  rapid growth.of skill, experience, and a sense of responsibility in ground men and mechanics,  should render improbable cases of engine failure occurring almost directly after an aeroplane has left the ground; while the careful training of flyers should  pre- vent them from falling into the error of starting away on a flight with a motor that is not running  well. B. Errors in  Piloting   Errors in piloting,  so far  as one can isolate them as a cause of accident, are not  likely to involve  a flyer in much danger so long as  he is at a sufficient altitude.  Peace flyingwill also remove the necessity from all  civil flyers of making those  extreme manoeuvres which are  called for in war  in darting  from or at an enemy, or spinning down to get out of his reach, so that all errors connected with practising these evolutions will be absent.   The comparative leisure of peace flying should tend also to prevent accidents due to hurried teaching, or to  errors of judgment on the  part of  instructors   in  ordering  pupils to make flights or carry out manoeuvres  for which their degree of proficiency has  riot  prepared them.   Rashness on the part of young flyers, and the taking of unnecessary risks, should also be discouraged more effectually when a longer period can be allowed for tuition, and when there  are not the exigencies of war to justify such risks.   Errors in piloting, when an aviator  is making his contact with the  ground  after a flight,  account for a  large number of accidents,  though  these,  generally speaking,   are  notmachine has left the ground,  and before it has attained a height of more than a few  hundred feet.  Under these circumstances, ifthe readings^ of the instruments are used  intelligently,  it is fre-cmently possible to turn  back into the aerodrome; but what oftenhappens is that the pilot,  instead  of looking at the instruments.looks only at the ground.  Under these circumstances, after he hasturned across  the wind, the  ground may appear to him if  the turn has been correctly banked to be moving sideways under him,and in the direction it would appear to move if he were doing avery much over-banked turn at a greater height above the ground.The  pilot&apos;s instinct is therefore to hold the lower wing up, andto make aii under-banked turn.  The number of accidents due tofaulty piloting, on the part of inexperienced pilots during a turn.near the  ground, might be greatly  reduced by better education.and  also  by a greater confidence in the  instruments,  which areflow extremely reliable.&quot;
attended .by  serious consequences.  A broken undor-carriagois, as a rule, the worst that happens, and though experience shows  that  an aeroplane may  overturn  occasionally and bedamaged badly, its occupants generally escape. Landing withthe wind  instead of against  it will often lead to a machinebeing  damaged  by collision through a pilot failing to bring it to  a standstill  within the length of  run  he  normallyexpects.  Another orror of  piloting  when  in the act of descendingis to alight  side to wind.   In this case, if  the aeroplanehas a  sideway as well as a forward motion  at  the moment of contact with  the  ground the running wheels  may buckle,and the breakage of  the entire chassis, and perhaps the over-turning of the machine, may  result.  Such accidents in  landing are not always to be laid to the door of tho flyer.  It may happen,  through  tho absence ofany wind-vane or smoke, which gives him a reliable indica-tion, that he is  unable  to judge accurately the  direction ofthe ground wind.  When chains of aerodromes are in exist-ence it will  be easy and  inexpensive to  place on each, in aposition where it is  seen  easily by  a pilot while descending,some standard type of wind-direction indicator.C. Faulty Construction.  Accidents due to faulty construction are becoming far less frequent owing  to  the  increasing  knowledge and skill  ofdesigners and constructors, the adoption of ample  actors of strength,  and the care  which is exercised in the choice  and inspection  of materials  employed.   At present, however,greatly though design and construction have improved, it ispossible for a machine in the course of tho violent manoeuvresdictated by  war service,  to  be subjected to such abnormalstrains that  some part of it collapses and robs the pilot ofcontrol.  Another risk of structural breakage which must be reckonedwith is that of a rough landing having done some damage toa machine-say  to  the rear of  the fuselage.  This, if  itescapes detection at the time,  may lead  afterwards, when a machine is subjected to strain, to a collapse in flight.  Constructional risks may bo encountered,  even  in future.by Avers who are called upon  to handle machines of an experi-mental type, the behaviour of which, when actually in  flight.is being determined  by  practical tests.   These  risks affectonly indirectly  tho  general  public or potential  passengers.who would not  be introduced  till long after such  risks  hadbeen studied and eliminated.D. Dangerous Manoeuvres.  There should be a distinction, of course, between dangerousmanoeuvres which are unnecessary and those which aro called for in  learning,  and in afterwards performing,  the  abruptand often violent evolutions which must be  made in  aerialfighting.   The  risks attached to  the latter  are inevitablewhile  we  are at war; but in commercial or  pleasure flying,when  only  safe  and reasonable  piloting  will be  required.accidents under this heading should become  extremely rare.In  the Air  Force  naturally, even under peace conditions,dangerous  manoeuvres must bo carried out on occasion ; butthere will be no justification  for them in civil flying.E. Meteorological Odndiitions.  Certain  accidents, have, it seems probable, been  due  toabnormal  atmospheric  conditions, or at least to the  dis-comfiture of the pilot by such conditions; and  data; in this regard&apos; though a certain amount of information is already available need to be far more extensive. We  refer to thisquestion,  briefly, under a later heading.F. Fires.  This cause of  accident, occurring when a machine is  in-flight,  or when  it has crashed after a bad landing, is  nowreceiving the closest attention, and, under the  less arduousconditions of peace flying,  and  with the  experience  anddata   already obtained,  it   should become possible very greatly to minimise this danger.G.  Illness  of a  Pilot.  In the j\annex to  the Appendix,  a case is mentioned of an accident which  was assumed to be due  to the indispositionof the flyer, and there have been other obscure cases whichhave been  attributed to the  same cause.  In war flying,Under the strain of ascending rapidly to high altitudes,  indiving steeply,  or in spiralling or  other violent movements.cases are to be expected of giddiness, or of temporary lossof consciousness.  In peace  flying  there should, ordinarily.be  none  of these  extreme  physical  strains: and medicalexaminations, carried  out periodically, should obviate therisk, of a  commercial pilot, while in charge say  of a  pas-senger craft, losing control of  his machine through  anysudden attack of illness.                             II.    THE NEED FOR  INVESTIGATING  ACCIDENTS.  Before  the war the Royal  Aero Club and the  AeronauticalSociety, through their Accidents&apos;  Investigation Committee,whoso findings  in twenty-six enquiries we summarise as  an Annex, were in the process  of  obtaining  valuable data;while recently a  committeo has been appointed  by the Aithoard, under  the presidency of Col. 0&apos;Gorman, to examinewhen called upon by tho Services the causes of accidentswhich befall naval and military pilots and machines.  Hitherto, however, and at the  present time, an accidenthas as a rule to bo very serious, and generally fatal, before it is investigated; and while wo are at war it is  unreason-able to expect that each minor  mishap shall be investigated,But when  peace  comes, and wo  enter on  tho era of civil aerial  transport,  it  will bo found no doubt that firms willinvestigate  every accident  which happens  to  their craft,even though this should be no more serious than the com.pulsory descent of  an aeroplane, made  without hurt to anyone on an aerodrome, through,  let us  say, some slightengine  defect. Enterprising   firms may  be  expected,  infact, to study tho details of everything that happens whichshould not  happen;  of every  mechanical  breakdown,  no matter  how insignificant,  which  serves to  delay or inter-nipt a  flight;  of  every kind of  atmospheric  condition,abnormal or otherwise,  which affects the travel of  a machinefrom  point to point,  or produces conditions which a flyerhas not  experienced before.  The  fatal accident is often  tho worst to approach fromthe  point  of  view  of  investigation.   Both the  occupantsof a machine, if there is  a  passenger  as well  as pilot,may bo  killed, while  the machine  itself, as  the result ofits crash, presents in  tho majority  of cases such  a hopelessmass of wreckage that  nothing definite can be learned from it.  But where we should learn valuable, lessons under peace conditions,  is  from those small  accidents  which,  if theyare  not  investigated  and  their causes  discovered  andeliminated, may  lead  eventually  to serious accidents  and loss  of life.  In  minor mishaps the conditions arc  often  favourable for investigation.   Apart  from any testimony which maybe obtained from expert eyewitnesses, there are accessiblethe  statements of thoso actually in the  aeroplane; while there is also  the machine itself,  which, though  it may be somewhat  damaged, is rarely damaged  badly enough toprevent  a critical examination.                           III.METHODS OF  OBTAINING RELIABLE INFORMATION.  The  testimony of  lay  witnesses to  an accident  whopossess no technical knowledge is generally unreliable.  Aman may say he heard an explosion in. the air,  and then,shortly  afterwards, saw a  machine  fall.   This gives  theimpression  that  the accident was due primarily to enginefailure.   What may have happened,  in fact, is that  the pilot merely switched off in the ordinary way and that hislengine gave  the  not unusual  exhaust pop, or backfired!harmlessly, making the noise tho lay  witness  heard.  Iiilreality the pilot, while gliding, may have  lost  control of hislmachine as the result of some  error of judgment absolutely!unconnected with the  switching  off of his engine.  If  toolmuch reliance is  placed on non-technical evidence, the trend!of an  enquiry may be misdirected; but at the  sam&apos;e time!it should often be possible, by a series of questions carefully!framed,  to gain  useful information  from  a  non-technicallwitness.                                                 I   Before the  war the Royal  Aero  Club,  jointly with  theAeronautical Society, in their  scheme  of accident investiga-tion, appointed  technical representatives  on  the principalaerodromes whose duty was, when a- fatality  occurred, to collect all details possible,  to  examine the machine before it &apos;was  moved, and to prepare  a report  which could  beconsidered if necessary   with  other  evidence by   theAccidents&apos; Committee.  Hero was  the nucleus of an organisa-tion, although tho  fifteen  representatives which were  allthat had been appointed, prior to tho war, will  need to beincreased in  numbers  after the  war.   The representatives on the flying grounds, as appointed  before the war,  werenot accident  investigators  pure and  simple;  their mainand permanent occupation  lay generally in some executiveor other work in connection with an aerodrome. Accidentinvestigation  was a side issue with them, which they toolup voluntarily.  It  might happen,  therefore, under  suchconditions of appointment,  that they were not  present onan aerodrome when an accident took  place.   It was withsuch a contingency in mind that more than one  accident!representative was  appointed  on  the  principal aerodromes,This arrangement proved adequate in pre-war times, whenonly very serious accidents were investigated,  but after thewar it  is submitted  that the permanent  appointment ofsuitable and salaried persons, will be necessary.   Their dutyshould  be to investigate accidents which  happen in theirirrespective  jurisdictions, and  to report  to  some  centraiauthority, such  as  the Research Association.   These,  i&quot;vestigators could be  stationed at  chosen  aerodromes,  andit  seems probable  that the. widening of  the field of in-investigation before  referred to,   and  an increasing volumeof   aerial   traffic would have  the  effect of  keeping&apos;themoccupied.                                          -\   It is suggested  that the  investigators at  main aero-
222dromes should  havo a certain  number  of  tho subsidiary rounds in their neighbourhood placed  within their juris-jction.   At these smaller grounds the expert investigatorfrom the main aerodrome could, from among tho staff avail-able, appoint someone  to  represent him in  the  case of an accident,  and to make any preliminary  investigation thatmight bo  necessary  before ho  (tho  expert  investigator)arrived.  In this way, with permanent investigators on theprincipal  aerodromes, and  with these men appointing repre-sontatives on intermediate grounds, a system of investiga-tion might bo built up. It will be necessary to obtain the co-operation  of aviatorsand to represent to them the value of  accident investiga-tion.  This co-operation should  take  the form  of  reports by flyers not only as  to mishaps, but also as to other  unusualexperiences due to meteorological or other causes.                          IV.THE NECESSITY FOR  AN EXPERT  EXAMINATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF  THE DATA  OBTAINED. In tho  pre-war  system  tho Accidents&apos;  Committee of the[loyal  Aero Club and  the Aeronautical  Society, after con-sidering a fatality and agreeing as to  its view of what had occurred, issued a  report.    In this report,  as occasiondemanded, tho Committee drew the attention of designers,constructors, flyers, and others to any  feature of the report which seemed of importance for the purpose of  preventingtho  recurrence  of an  accident from any cause  establishedjy the report. After the war,  however, when small  mishaps as  well  asarge become matters  for  investigation,  there should bo avolume of  material with  which  to deal which should  be suffiently  large to justify the establishment of a  bureau,with a permanent office and1 staff, for the purpose  of deal-ing  with accident reports.  The officials (of this bureau couldclassify reports, at first roughly and then in  greater detail,and accumulate by degrees  prepared data  which  should,when examined finally and reported on, throw  a valuable ght on the question  of  accident prevention. As to the institution of such  a  bureau,  it would seem that much  may be expected  from the proposed  formationby  the aeronautical  industry  of  a Research  Association,which it is hoped will  be aided by financial grants from theDepartment  of Scientific and  Industrial   Research,   toamplify sums obtained  from the industry.  To the research work of this  Association  might, it  is submfitted, be added the  work of a permanent  bureau for  the examination andclassification of the  reports which would be  obtained fromaccident  investigators.  The  bureau would  have to be  infree and  constant touch   with the industry  it served (notforgetting, of course,  that it would also be serving thepublic), and the industry as  a whole  would be benefitedvery greatly  and the  safety of flying  increased, if therewere proper access,  for well-recognised  persons  and firms.to information in regard  to accidents. In the  investigation of small  accidents  and mishaps,which  would  probably  form the  bulk of the work of the bureau, each case would, no doubt, bo classified under some special heading, without an individual  report being issuedconcerning it, and when  there was a sufficient  number  ofcases  from which to  draw definite conclusions, tho directorof tho bureau would issue a memorandum.  This would be made  accessible  to.  thoso  engaged in  tho  industry,  andprobably also  to the technical and general Press. THE  USE TO WHICH THE RESULTS On EXPERT             EXAMINATION CAN  BE PUT.  It is necessary  to consider  what use may  be made ofaccident  reports  after they  havo  been  examined  andclassified,  and aro  presented  in the  form of summarisedstatistics.  In tho case of engines, it is hoped  that it may bo possibleto  discovor,  from  an  examination  and  classification  of accidents,  just what  parts  of any  particular engino  orengines aro proved to be most likely to give trouble under certain given circumstances.  With designers  and constructors,  also,  it should  bepossible-af tor a sufficient amount of accident data had beenclassified1 to point  out to them, so  far as some  particularmachino was concerned, that a weakness lay here or there,or  that the testimony of  pilots was that certain small im-improvements were necessary to  facilitate control.  It will be  desirable,  during  the immediate  post-war de-velopment  of commercial flying, to secure close co-operationbetween tho makers  of aircraft and  of engines and theusers of such apparatus.  Apart irom accidents due, say, to engine stoppage,  therewill bo others no doubt caused  by errors of judgment on thepart of aviators.   In such  cases, when sufficient data havebeen obtained from which to draw conclusions the accidentsbureau would  probably report  to   that  branch   of thoResearch Association which is considering the training offlyers,  and suggest improvements or modifications  in tuition.It  is assumed that  after the war  adequate tos&apos;ts  will been forced before  a  river is given a certificate of proficiency,and particularly that ho should have  had sufficient experi-ence to enable jhinil to  cope successfully  with any  predica-ment  which  is likely  to  arise in cross-country  flying, as distinct  from aerodrome flying.  One  respect in which the Accidents&apos; Bureau can  help inthe general work of research  will be in  placing  before the meteorological department of  the Research  Association alldata it may  he able to obtain as to the part played in anyparticular  accident by the atmospheric conditions prevailing at  the time.  Looking into the  future, one sees  that four factors, inaddition  to a  scheme of  accident investigation,  are ofimportance.  These  aro :     1.  An  increase in the  number of alighting grounds.       The elimination of  engine failure.       The careful training of flyers.       The forecasting  of the  weather for as long a period        as possible ahead,  and some system of distributing        these forecasts rapidly to  aerodromes throughout        tho country; also warnings of approaching weather        changes of  any importance.  With all  these,  the  investigation of accidents is either directly or indirectly connected.9,4.
ANNEX.Summary of the  Work,  Prior to  the War, of  the Public Safety and Accidents Investigatiol                 Committee of  the Royal  Aero  Club and  Aeronautical  Society.  In  1012  tho Royal Aero Club, jointly with  tho Aero-nautical  Society, appointed a Special Committee known astho Public Safety and Accidents Investigation  Committeo,to obtain reports as to aeroplane accidents, and to endeavourto discover the causes of such accidents,  and to  express an opinion, whenever possible, as to how they might  bo avoidedin future.   Official representatives were  appointed on thoprincipal aerodromes, whoso duty it was, should an  accidentoccur, to gain  all information  possiblo  concerning it, toexamine  tho  wrecked machine, and to  bring  before theOommitteo all the information which could bo secured.  Between 1912 and 1914-when the outbreak of war inter-rupted tho work  o,f  tho  Committee twenty-six  fatalitiashad boon investigated.  Tho main causes of accidents  before the war, as shown byan examination of the Committee&apos;s reports, were:    1. Errors of judgment on tho  part of  a flyer.  2. Tho  structural breakage of some part of an aeroplane      whilo in flight.  Nino of  the  twenty-six fatalities wero duo to errors of judgment.  In  two oases accidents  wero shown to  bo  due to a pilotattempting a  flight in a machine which was out of adjust-ment, with tho result fhat it side-slipped whilo  turning.  In  two others,  pilots  dived  their machines so suddenlyand steeply that they wero jerked forward on to their con-trols,  accentuating tho descent  to such a degreo that theyfell from their machines while in tho air.  In  two more cases, the accident was caused by a  machinenose-diving, while gliding, through the pilot allowing it toloso flying  speed.  The remaining  three  cases  may   be summarised  asfollows :    (i) A pilot was making a series of spectacular evolutions,      low down over an aerodrome, when his machine side-      slipped.  (ii) A pilot over-banked  while turning  at  a low  altitude,      and this  was followed by  a nose-dive.  (iii)  A pilot dived steeply, then flattened out too suddenly,      fracturing a wing.  Of  accidents due primarily to engine  failure, or enginetrouble, the Committee investigated three though it shouldbe noted that,  in  each case, and subsequent to  the trouble with  his  engine, the flyer  wais guilty of some error of judg-ment. These cases&quot; are summarised herewith  :   (i) A pilot&apos;s  engine was  observed  to stop when he was at      an altitude of about 200 feet.  Shortly  afterwards the      machine  nose-dived.   In the Committee&apos;s opinion, the      accident  was due to  the aviator failing to appreciate      the danger of keeping his craft in  a  horizontal position      after the engine had stopped, thereby losing flying      speed. (ii) A pilot, finding his engine  running badly after leaving      an aerodrome, turned in  the air  in order to fly back      to  his starting point; but in making the turn he lost      speed and altitude  to a dangerous extent, and  whilo      passing  low near a  belt of trees,  which may  have set      up disturbed air in the neighbourhood  of his machine,      the craft was seen to dive.(iii) A pilot attempted a flight with an  engine that was not      working  properly, with the result that the  machine      gradually lost altitude until it fell into  a river.  Eight of the twenty-six accidents investigated were shown to be  due to the breakage of some part of a machine.  these may be summarised as follows :    (i) A quick-release device  of a wing-cable opened and the      cable came adrift, flapping up and  piercing the fabric      of  a wing, which, then burst and  allowed the machine      to  fall. (ii) An aircraft collapsed  in flight through the  breakage      of  the wires supporting a wing,  following upon some      derangement of the cabane, this  derangement being      due either to a portion of  the revolving engine fouling      the engine cowl, or by a partial failure or breakage of      the propeller, which threw the rotating system out of (vii)(viii)      balance, and set up stresses which  caused the engij      to shift.                                       0 j (iii) The wings of an aircraft collapsed whilo the macbirj      was Hying in an extremely high wind. (iv) An elevating plane broke and  allowed  a machine fcl      divo so steoply  that tho main planes collapsed.  (v) A wing broke as the result of a faulty repair to a main)      spar. (vi) A wing failed, owing to want of sufficient strength      withstand the  stresses produced  either  by  a violi      wind or sudden warping.     An aircraft collapsed whilo in flight owing to inhered      structural weakness.     A rudder  became  detached from  a machine  in  fligl      owing (in  the opinion of tho Committee) to  its  beim      insufficiently strong to resist a sudden  and abnorim      strain, and owing also to tho fact  that it had probablj      been strained in a previous flight.  In connection  with accidents duo to  structural ^weakneithe Committeo made  two recommendations.  One  was tha:as aircraft aro  built of perishable materials,  all machimwhich havo been in existence for some time should undergocritical examination, both as regards framework and fabric,  The  second  recommendation was that  all  repairs   tomachine must bo carried out under expert and responsessupervision.  As to tho remaining six accidents, making Jthe total of twenty-six, their causes are summarised below (i) The pilot of an experimental machine lost control in      gusty wind. (ii) A  pilot ascended while in an unfit  state of health, ail      apparently lost  consciousness while his  machine %      gliding.(iii) A  pilot lost control through his foot slipping on tt!      rudder-bar.    A  pilot who was giving a public demonstration  on      aerodrome of insufficient size turned sharply to  avoi)      endangering spectators, with  the  result  that  hi      machine side-slipped from a low altitude. (v) A  pupil, flying with an  instructor in  a  dual-contri      machine, appeared to resist for some unknown reasot      the ruddering action of the latter, with the result tha      the machine became uncontrollable.(vi) A pilot who was landing, and whose view was obstructs      to some extent by his radiator, ran into some  people      who  had encroached on the  flying ground,  with th      result that one person was killed and several injured  The  Committee  found  it necessary,  in its endeavour tdetermine the causes of  accidents,  to request local authorties, in cases where aircraft fell  in open country, to prevethe wreckage of the machine being moved until it had be examined by experts, and this will assuredly have  to be eried out after tho war.(ivFINAL NOTE. &apos; Looking at pre-war accidents in the light of conditions sue jas  will exist, probably, when pcaco comes, one very appreciable element of risk, that of structural collapse,  should 1eliminated  almost entirely.  This being so, we find that what we shall have left, asmain risk of accident, will be engine failure,  followed perhaf jby an error of judgment on the part of the  flyer.  To lessethis  risk we must,  of course,  perfect our aero-engines, an!eliminate by degrees those  small  causes of stoppage,  or otrouble,  which  (insignificant in themselves)  may lead nonthe less to  a serious accident.  It should be noted again that, when an aviator who encounters  engine trouble has a chain of alighting grounds  alonihis flying route, he  will be far less likely to find himself incritical  position; also that, when we have  the comparativleisure of peace  in  which to train flyers more carefully, amalso  more scientifically, they should be less likely to be guiltof  errors of judgment.

ANNEX.Summary of the  Work,  Prior to  the War, of                 Committee  of  the Royal  Aero    In 1912 tho Royal Aero  Club,  jointly  with the  Aoro-  nautical Society, appointed  a Special Committee known as  tho  Public Safety and Accidents  Investigation Committee,  to obtain reports as to aeroplane accidents, and to endeavour  to discover the causes of such accidents, and to express an  opinion, whenever possible, as to how they might bo avoided  in future.  Official  representatives were appointed .on tho  principal aerodromes, whoso  duty it was, should an accident  occur, to gain  all information possible concerning  it, to  examine  the  wrecked machine, and to bring  before tho  Committee all the information which could be secured.    Between 1912 and  1914 when the outbreak of war inter-  ruptcd tho work of tho  Committee twenty-six fatalities  had  been investigated.    The main causes of accidents before the war, as shown by  an examination of the Committee&apos;s reports, were:      1.  Errors of judgment on tho part of  a flyer.    2.  Tho structural  breakage of some part of an aeroplane         whilo in flight.    Nino of the twenty-six  fatalities wero due to errors of  judgment.    In two oases accidents were shown to bo due to a pilot  attempting  a flight in a machine which was  out of adjust-  inent, with the result fhat it side-slipped while turning.    In two others, pilots dived their machines so suddenly  and  steeply that they were jerked forward on to their con-  trols,  accentuating the descent to such a degree that they  fell  from  their machines while in the air.    In two more cases, the accident was caused by a machine  nose-diving, while gliding, through the pilot allowing it to  lose  flying speed.    The  remaining  three  cases  may  be  summarised  as  follows:      (i)  A pilot  was making a  series of spectacular evolutions,         low down over an aerodrome, when his machine side-         slipped.    (ii)  A pilot over-banked while turning at  a low  altitude,         and this was followed  by a nose-dive.    (iii)  A pilot  dived steeply, then flattened out too suddenly,        fracturing a wing.    Of accidents due  primarily  to  engine failure, or  engine  trouble, the Committee investigated three though it should  be noted  that, in each case, and subsequent  to the trouble  with his engine,  the flyer was guilty of  some error of judg-  ment.  These cases&quot; are summarised herewith :     (i)  A pilot&apos;s engine was observed to stop  when he  was at         an  altitude of about 200 feet.  Shortly afterwards the         machine nose-dived.  In the Committee&apos;s opinion, the         accident was due to the aviator failing to appreciate         the danger of keeping his craft in a horizontal position         after the  engine  had stopped, thereby losing  flying         speed.   (ii)  A pilot, finding  his engine  running  badly after leaving         an aerodrome, turned in tho air  in order to fly back         to his starting point;  but in making the turn he lost         speed and  altitude to a dangerous extent, and whilo         passing low near a belt of trees,  which may have set         up disturbed air in the neighbourhood of his machine,         the craft was seen to dive.  (iii)  A pilot attempted a flight with an  engine that was not         working properly,  with  the  result that the machine         gradually lost altitude until it fell into a river.    Eight of the twenty-six accidents investigated were  shown  to be due to the breakage of some part of a machine.  These  may be summarised  as follows:      (i)  A quick-release device of  a  wing-cable opened and the         cable came adrift, flapping up  and piercing the fabric         of a wing, which then burst and allowed the machine         to fall.   (ii)  An  aircraft collapsed  in  flight through  the  breakage         of the wires supporting a wing, following upon some         derangement  of the cabane, this derangement being         due either  to a portion of the revolving engine fouling         the engine cowl, or by a partial failure or breakage of         the propeller, which threw the rotating system  out of the Public Safety and Accidents InvestigatiJClub and  Aeronautical  Society.        balance, and  set up  stresses which caused the oncii        to shift.                                       b   (iii) The wings of  an aircraft collapsed while the machii        was Hying in an extremely high wind.   (iv) An elevating  plane broke and  allowed  a machine        divo so steeply that tho main planes collapsed.    (v) A wing broke as the result of a faulty repair to a man)        spar.   (vi) A wing failed, owing to want of sufficient strength        withstand the  stresses produced  either  by  a violei        wind or sudden warping.   (vii) An aircraft collapsed while in flight owing to inhere]        structural weakness.  (viii) A rudder became detached from  a  machine  in dig)        owing (in the opinion of the Committee) to  its beii        insufficiently  strong  to resist a sudden  and abnorm        strain, and owing also to the fact  that it had probably        been strained in a previous flight.    In connection  with accidents due to  structural ^veaknes  the Committeo mado  two  recommendations.   One  was tha  as aircraft aro built of  perishable materials,  all macliia  which have been in existence for some time should undergo  critical examination, both as regards framework and fabric    The  second  recommendation  was that all repairs  to  machine must bo carried out under expert  and responsible  supervision.   As to  the remaining six accidents, making u  the total of twenty-six, their causes are summarised below:-   (i) The pilot  of  an experimental machine lost control in        gusty wind.   (ii) A  pilot  ascended while in an unfit  state of health,  ai        apparently  lost consciousness while his  machine  w        gliding.  (iii) A  pilot lost  control  through his foot slipping on  tl        rudder-bar.  (iv) A  pilot  who  was  giving  a  public demonstration on        aerodrome of  insufficient  size turned sharply to avo        endangering  spectators,  with  tho  result  that        machine side-slipped from a low altitude.   (v) A  pupil, Hying  with  an instructor in  a  dual-centre        machine, appeared to resist for some unknown reaso        the ruddering action  of the latter, with the result tha        the machine became uncontrollable.  (vi) A pilot who was landing, and whose view was obstructe        to some extent by his radiator, ran into some people        who had encroached on the flying ground, with tli        result that one person was killed and several injured Ij    The  Committee found  it necessary,  in its endeavour )  determine the causes  of accidents, to request local authon  ties, in cases where  aircraft fell in open country, to prevei  the wreckage of the machine being moved until it had bee  examined by experts,  and this will assuredly have to be  cai  ried out after the war.                      FINAL NOTE.    Looking at pre-war  accidents in the  light of conditions sue  as  will exist, probably, when peace comes, one very apprcc  able element of  risk, that  of structural collapse,  should 1  eliminated almost entirely.    This being so, we find  that what we  shall have  left, as  main risk of accident, will be engine failure, followed perhap  by an error of judgment on the  part of  the flyer.  To lesse  this risk we must, of course, perfect  our aero-engines,  an  eliminate  by degrees  those small causes of  stoppage, or o  trouble, which  (insignificant  in  themselves)  may lead  non  the less to a serious accident.    It should be noted again that, when an aviator who encounter  ters engine  trouble  has a chain of alighting grounds alon  his flying route, he will bo far less likely to find himself  in  critical  position;  also that, when we have the comparativ  leisure of peace in which to train flyers more carefully,  an  also more scientifically, they should be less likely to be guilt  of  errors of judgment.
