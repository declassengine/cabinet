About 80 tons have been cleared to date.              A trial is now running of an artificial drying tunnel at    Tonbridge, which gives proroiso of success.

Six additional soldiers have arrived on the Colony    for farm work         Holbeach.   Evorybody is busily engaged in getting in the          potatoes,         Hoath Hill.    During the week only 61 acres of &quot;/heat have been    drilled,  frost each morning preventing an early start being made.

The Estate- Coramitte - also felt that in view of theimportant of the matt r and their lack of technical knowledge inconnection therewith, they should engage as advisor a consultingofficer with practical experience in seed raising both from theagricultural and technological standpoint.  Arrangements for this are in progress.          At a local auction sale the Estate Manager with theauthority of the Committee secured small fields on the Estate (not included in the purchase) comprising 7-V acres for the sum of  260.Certain other fields on the Estate which -ere not secured by himw-r^ sold at the sale for as much as  60 per acre, and the Committeenoted with satisfaction this definite proof that th* purchase ofthe Estate had be.;n made at a low figure.Live Stock Branch.V/ork of Branch,-   11 Applications v,ere approved for the export of 22 horses    3               11       &quot;     &quot;   &quot;     &quot;    &quot; 23 cattle    3        &quot; -              &quot;     ft   h     n    h 19 pi/3;s    4        &quot;      &quot;       h     m   m     n    m 58 p0Uitry.

Schedules are being addressed to farmero for a return onDecember 1st of the stocks of pntatoes specially  required by the ministry of Food.          Owing to the improved outlook f^r feeding stuffs, throughthe Kinistry of Food releasing more barley and offals, store pigshave been in much better demand during the week.          The olosing of some of the smaller tattle markets,thicfly in arable diGtritti-, is oausing some anxiety to farmers *The polity of the Ministry of Food appears to be  to acc.pt as manycattle as possible from the big grazing districts, where there arestill many t1  come forward, and to refuse those from the arabledistricts, withholding them until a later period  of the year.
