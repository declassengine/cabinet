SECRET.COMPLIANCE WITH NAVAL CONDITIONS OP ARMISTICE.is/oAdmiralty Memorandum for the WarJ&amp;Miigt.     It will doubtless be of interest to the Cabinet to learn what has transpired at the meeting be two in theCommander-in-Chiof, Grand Fleet, and Roar-Admiral Meurer.     The German Cruiser  &quot;Konigsberg&quot;, escorted by the 6thLight Cruiser Squadron,  arrived in &quot;the Forth at 6.10 p.in.last evening, whereupon  an Officer was sent on board11 Ko nigs berg11 to inform Rear-Admiral Meuror that the Comuander-in-Chief was prepared to see hirn and his Staff Officers atonce but would not receive the delegates of tho Workmen1 sand Soldiers1 Council.   The Rear-Admiral and Officers appearedto be pleased with this  decision and came on board &quot;QUEEN&quot;ELIZABETH&quot; at 7.35 p.in.  They were received at the Conference tableby the Coirfnander-in-Ohief, with whom were the Admiral Coiii landingthe First Battle Squadron, the Chief of Staff and the Rear-Admiral Commanding the Harwich Force.     The Co:.:.ander-in-Chief then read through the detailedrequirements for carrying out the Conditions of Armistice.Rear-Admiral Heuror explained that he was authorised torepresent only the Com;ander-in-Chief,High Seas Fleet,and notthe Gorman Adiralty and was unable to furnish tho full information required in regard to certain matters ,such as German AuxiliaryVessels,position of Minefields outside North Sea etc.     The Conaander-in-Chief, thereupon arranged for telegrams to be transmitted en clair on behalf of Rear-Adiniral Menrcrto the German Commander-in-Chief regarding these points^also,atRear-Aolmiral Meurer1 s request, telegraphed the full context of instructions regarding the surrender of the Submarinest and it was anticipated that all the information required would be forthcomingthis&apos;(Satur day) mor ning.     The Commander-in-Chief reports that throughout theConference the attitude  of the Germans was very correct,and theimpression was given that they were ready to agree to^any proposals.     Rear-Admiral Meurer suggested that we did not appreciate the chaotic conditions existing in Germany, which render theexecution of the Armistice Terns extremely difficult.. He Statedthat while it is the earnest desire of the German people tocomply with the Armistice Terms and to secure peace at the earliestpossible moment, he anticipated considerable difficulty incomplying with certain of the Terms owing to the chaos which exists in the Command and to tho fact that action can only be taken withthe consent of the Y/orkmen1 s and Soldiers1  Council.     As an indication of the attitude of the men of the German Fleettowards the Armistice Terms jit may be mentioned that a message enclair was sent out last  evening by the Soldiers1 Council of submarine Flotillas.  The Message states that at a meeting of submarine crews held in  consequence of statements in the german press,as to the carrying out of the Ilaval Armistice Terms aresolution had been unanimously passed to the effect that theSubmarine crews protest  energetically against recent utterancesof the Conxiander-in^Chief of the High Seas Fleet and that &quot;tho wholeof the crews of Submarine Flotillas conscious of the serious position of the Fatherland and after having striven for theirFatherland for 50 months in noed and privation will not refuse tothe Fatherland the last  and hardest service: , they will bring all
all the Submarines to the place to which they are ordered the Message also states that the men have full confidence in the SoldiersT Council and will obey their instructionsfully and completely.(Sgd)   ERIC QEDDES.16/11/18.
