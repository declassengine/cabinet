We are very strongly of opinion that the Government areplaying into the hands of tho Private Traders.  In any cosethere is no doubt that the rents which are being proposed for houses that are to be built is out of all proportion to the ability of tho working class in this district to pay.  we ask that serious consideration vshould be givan not merely to thesupply of houses, but also to the rents which Ere to be charged for said houses. .                               Yours truly,(Signed)DUNCAN GRAHAM.   General Secretary.
