Present:                  TEE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair).The  Right Hon. the VISCOUNT MILNER, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., Secretary of State for     War.The  Right Hon. SIR ALBERT STANLEY, M.P., President of the Board of Trade.SIR GUY CALTHROP, Bart., Coal Controller.Lieutenant-General SIR G. M. W.

HANKEY, K.C.B., Secretary.Captain CLEMENT JONES, Assistant Secretary.The Coal Situation:      1.  WITH reference to War Cabinet 506, Minute 10, the PrimeRelease of Miners   Minister said that he regretted to learn that the Cabinet instructions,from the Army.     that  miners were to be released  immediately from the  army in                 France were not being properly carried out.  In view of the fact                 that  there was no longer  any fighting, nor  any prospect of any                , resumption of hostilities, there seemed to be no  good reason why                 the miners should not be returned at once, and in large numbers.                 The matter was -urgent, for, unless the supplies of coal in this country                 were increased, it was not impossible  that there might be a revolu-                 tion.   Even now the spirit of lawlessness was apparent, and no one              1   could say what might  happen  if, for instance, there was  no coal                 in the East End in December.                     Sir Albert Stanley  said that  the number of miners  returned                 from France only amounted to about 5,000 men.  The coal situation                 was  much more  serious than  before the armistice, because the                 public, prompted by the feeling that  the war was over, were  using                 up their coal stocks, and would undoubtedly look to the Government                 for more when those stocks were exhausted.                     The Adjutant-General explained  that  the great difficulty in the                 way of obtaining the miners from the army in France was due to                 the fact  that certain units, e.g., the Welsh Division, the Durhams,                 and the Northumberland Fusiliers, would be practically disbanded                 if the miners were taken away.  It must be remembered that the                 Cabinet had  agreed  that the existing number of divisions in the                 British Army in France was to be maintained. .

Medical Exaniina-tion of releasedMiners.     The Prime Minister  said  tliat the  Cabinet had no wish tointerfere in the matter of  the number  of divisions, but at thesame time the miners must be returned, even if  it  resulted in agreat reduction in the strength of certain units.  He suggested thatsomeone should go over to France to see FiekVMarshal Sir douglas haig on the subject, and  explain to him, on behalf of the Cabinet,the urgent and imperative need for getting the miners back.     Lord Milner said that, if it were considered desirable, he would himself go to France and see Sir Douglas  Haig on  the  following day.     It was decided that      Lord Milner, accompanied by the  Coal  Controller and experts         from the  Adjutant-General&apos;s Department,  should proceed         to General Headquarters, France, on the following day.    2. In this  connection it was pointed out that  some delay was caused by the men having to be medically boarded, by arrangement with the Ministry of Pensions, before they returned to the mines.    The Adjutant-General,  however, stated  that this  delay couldbe avoided if the demobilisation procedure were adopted.    It was decided that-    The demobilisation  procedure  in this  connection should  be        adopted.Remobilisation.     3.  The Secretary  of State for War said that there; was anotherquestion  that  required  a  decision,  namely,  the  provision forremobilisation.  For purposes of remobilisation, on which the PrimeMinister had laid great stress, it was essential that, when the men were discharged, instead of obtaining  a  complete discharge they shouldbe placed in a nominal  reserve, which  the Adjutant-General  saidwould be termed Class Z*     It  was agreed that the  miners on demobilisation  should be         transferred to Class Z of the Army Reserve (Paper No.         G.T.-6368).     The Adjutant-General  explained that  if the men were demobi-lised they  would  be  entitled  to  twenty-eight  days&apos;  furlough.The 11th November had  been suggested as the date  of demobilisa-tion, but  if this were  carried out there was a danger  lest the minersdischarged  from the  army might take a holiday.  He  therefore proposed that the miners should sign the  same  engagement as thepivotal men, who forego furlough but get twenty-eight days&apos; pay andSeparation Allowance.     It was decided that      The Adjutant-GeneraPs proposal should be adopted.Relaxation of CoalOrders.    4. Some discussion was held as to the desirability of relaxing the Orders as regards coal.  The question was whether  the house-hold consumer or the gas and electricity companies should be the first to reap the benefit of any increased output of coal.    The Coal Controller said  that he would like time to  considerthe matter further, and promised to inform the Prime Minister onthis point later in the day.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.  1          November 25, 1918.
