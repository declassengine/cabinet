The Trades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee,                             32, Eccleston Square.   London.                                   11th November,  1918.  Rt. Hon. P.  Lloyd George,M.P.,         Prime Minister.  Dear Mr. George,                  Agreeably with your request,  I  send you,  herewith,  a Memorandum  of the points raised &quot;by the deputation  from the Lahour Party Executive and the Trades  Union Congress  Parliamentary Committee,  which waited upon you a few days  ago.                            Yours faithfully,                               (Signed)  C I,  BOWRMAN.                                             Secretary,
Presented on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee of theTrades Union Congress and the National Executive of the LabourParty.          The proposal for iv &quot;orId Labour and Socialist Peace  Con-feronce to be held at the same time and in the same plade as  theOfficial Pea&amp;e Conference found expression,  in the first place, ina resolution of the American Federation of Labour.   Towards  theend of November 1914 - only four months after the beginning of thewar - the proposal was adopted with unanimity by their PhiladelphiaConvention.  The Executive Committee endeavoured to obtain approvalof the scheme, which was not universally acceptable&apos;to organizedLabour at tot time, and the Report describing their efforts was unanimously approved by the San Francisco Convention, held in November1915,&apos;          It was. recognized in this Report that the nations engagedin the war&apos;had the right to determine their own policies, and theAmerican Labour Movement did not propose any Interference with thatright.  The matters with which they were mainly concerned were&quot;those things which, have .to do with reorganisation at the end of  thewar, and therefore permanent peace between nations.&quot;          In the second stage, agreement on the proposal was  reached between the American Federation of Labour and the. Labour and  Social-Idt Movement In the Allied countries.          In February, 1918, the Inter-Allied Labour and the  SocialistConference resolved that M. Albert Thomas, (France),M. EmileVandervelde (Belgium) and Mr. Arthur Henderson (Great Britain)&quot;should organize a Labour and Socialist Conference, in which  no coun-try should&quot;be entitled.to more than four representatives, to  sitconcurrently with the Official Conference.&quot;&apos;          Representatives from the United States of America wereabsent from that Conference, but at the Conference held in the follow-ing September, it was placed beyond any possibility of doubt  thatthe American Federation of Labour had not abandoned their suggestionduring tho period of American participation in the Far.          A resolution welcomed the declaration by the AmericanFederation of Labour of the fundamental principles to be included inthe Peace Treaty, as being in substantial agreement with thoso applied in detail in the Memorandum on 1?&apos;ar Aims of the Inter-Allied Labourand Socialist Conference of February, 1918, and also with tho four-teen propositions of President Wilson,          The resolution further declared, on the suggestion of the delegation of the American federation of Labour, that &quot;a WorldLabour Peace Congress should be held at tho same time and plaoe asthe Peace Conference that will formulate the peace treaty closing the.war,&quot;       &apos;*&apos;                             *   --.  -  &apos;       M E 11 0 R A ft D U M           - on the -QRLD LABOUR AND SOCIALIST PLACE CONFERENCE           to be held     DURING PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
       The Conference also agreed to add Mr.  Gompers(UnitodStates), to the Special Commission of Messrs.  Henderson,Yandervclde anr1 Thomas, constituted at the previous Inter*-4lllcd^xConference.       The oropos&amp;l therefore is now fully accepted, not only bythe British Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, but by theorganized Labour and Socialist Movements of the British Self-Governing Dominions, the United States, Prance,. Italy,  Belgium,Serbia, Portugal, Humania end Greece.  All the parties  in theNeutral Countries end within the territories of the former Govern-ments of the Central Powers who presented memoranda to  theOrganizing Committee of the Stockholm Conferences,also  accepted a Similar proposal, without exception.       It has been felt on all occasions when the subject hasbeen discussed, that a  orld Labour Conference, held at the sametime and in the same place as the Official Peace conference,would create an atmosphere which would tend to the reduction of difficulties among: the diplomatists themselves.       Allied labour and Socialism recorded in September,1918,that the fourteen propositions of President Wilson- which a^e nowto be the &quot;basis of the Peace Treaty-were in substantial a i?eemontwith their own war aims.       An effort by Allied Labour to secure a willing acceptanceof an impartial application of these principles by the re-prosontativos of organized Labour throughout the world, would, weare oersuaded,be a service in the cause of enduring peace,  thepresence of Labour representatives amongst the yleni otentiaries,together with a concurrent Conference, would mark  the responsibilitieof Allied Labour in the highest degree.       Further, an international minimum standard  of Labour eon-ditions, is of great importance to highly industrialised countrieslike the United Kingdom, and Prince Max of Baden has observedthat this question will be raised at the Peace Conference by theplenipotentiaries of the German Government.  If agreement on th 3question could be obtained amongst the official representativesof organized Labour during the preliminary stages  of negotiations,the World Labour Conference would, &quot;orove to be  of invaluableassistance to the Commission ..hich ma- iu.vo to elaborate these aspects of the Peace Treaty.       In making these suggestions,  it will be seen tlwt Inter-national Labour is only anxious to bear its part in securing., a1.-sting- Peace.,  i/e presume th..,t the  right of British Labour toattend a- Conference at any time or place after the hostilitieshc.ve ceased will not be chillenged,  but we regard  it as  important to lay the  matter before you.11th November 1918.
