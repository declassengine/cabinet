i This Document tt  tha Property ofinINTERIM  REPORT  ON AFFAIRS  IN HOLLAND^(Circulated  by  the  Home  Secretary)      I have received from a very well-informed  correspondent in Holland thefollowing information:-      There  is an anti-Entente,  and more particularly an anti-English, current  of feeling in Holland, which is being steadily fanned  by certain persona in the Dutchmilitary and court circles.  Attempts are being  made to arouse the old Boer Warsentiment in favour of the Kaiser and of Germany.   It is perhaps worth mentioningthat during the  organized &quot;Orange&quot; demonstration at the Hague, tramcars and public buildings flew the flag of Mecklenburg-Schwerin  (the Prince&apos;s country), althoughthat country was nominally republican at the time.   A pro-German tinge was givento the demonstration.  Moreover, reports are being  circulated in Dutch militaryand pro-German circles that the  Revolution in the  1 Imperial German Republic&apos; isbeing organized  by the military, and in some places it is even directed by officersin plain clothes.   In these oircles there are hopes that the Revolution itself canultimately be utilized for royalist purposes, but the first step is to develop  a sharp anti-English movement in Germany and Holland* which would favour restoration.      The organization of the german Republic is receiving assistance from Holland,and some people  believe that it  is controlled from  that country,  The wholesaleexodus of reigning German Princes without any real  compulsion la consideredsignificant.  The Dutch pro-Germans believe that they are doing so by agreement,with the object  of assisting those who are secretly controlling the RepublicanMovement.      At first sight, it is difficult to see any connection between Troelstra&apos;9Bolshevik agitation and the German Military movement, but when we reflect that  anuncontrolled Bolshevik movement  in all Allied and Neutral countries would make matters very easy for a controlled German Revolution, we can see that the germans would have,some  object in promoting Bolshevik agitation outside Germany.      All these  intrigues could  be cut short if  the Kaiser and Crown Prince weremade to remove to some place vrhance all communication with Germany or contiguousneutral states oould be supervised.  I am informed  that if strong pressure were put upon the Dutch Government now, both the Kaiser  and the Grown Prince would be surrendered.  A  month or two later, when there has  been time to raise anti-british feeling, there would be popular  support for resisting such a demand, and theGovernment would not give way.      There  seems reason to believe that the German court circles are countingupon Bolshevism  to create such a state of anarchy  in Germany that all those whofavour law and order would unite for the restoration of imperial rule.B.
