(Sent 4.5 p.uu  18th November,  1918).        In attempting to carry out arrangements detailed in    telegram of June 6th with  regard to  Wool  allocated for    Allied Military purposes  serious diplomatic difficulties    have arisen.  United States have refused to agree to pay     ny higher price than is paid for british  Military Wool.    In order to maintain good  relations  and in view of    facilities accorded by the United States in .the supply    of other commodities&apos;required by the British  Empire    His Majestyfs Government have decided that the principle    insisted upon by tne United States must  be conceded.  His    Majesty!s Government proposes in order to prevent any loss    to your sheep farmers that a fixed bonus should be    credited to your Government on American and Italian Mill-    tary Wool,  in liou of the  half share of  expected profit on    such wool,  We suggest  3  per bale on merino wool plus  2    per bale on Crossbred Wool.   Instead of His fejesty&apos;s    Government  receiving any  profit  on such wool, your    Government will understand that  the  proposed bonus will be    charged as an addition to  the aggregate cost  of Military    Wool taken by all the Allied Governments so that British    Army and  %vy Votes will  bear their  proportionate share of    such bonus.  No Bonus will be payable on French Military    Wool in view of pre-existing arrangements.jj        Under the Contract with your Government, the ultimate    Bonus is to be calculated at the same rate as is ascer-    tained to be due under the Australian Contract.  The assert    of your Government is now  tasked  to the above  proposed    modifications which are being cabled simultaneously to the    Government of Australia.                            LONG.
