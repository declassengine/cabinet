Colonel House has spoken to me with regard to participation in Conference.

Following are his views :-

Conference should begin Monday December 16th. Each of the four Great Powers should have five seats at the table and other Powers from one to three according to their importance. Number in each case to be decided by four Great Powers. ?ach of the four Great Powers have a panel of representatives from which they should draw as might be required for particular subjects under discussion but in no circumstances would any Power be able exceed number of seats allott? to it at the table.
