(This Document 1B the Property of His Britannic Majesty fa, Goverrrment),SECRET i                        W A R  CABINET.G.T. 6fr9; . O^TOTAHCE OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION AFTER TIG TERMINATION OF TEE WAR.                 (Note by tho Minister of Reconstruction,)           I ha70 already had occasion to direct the attention    of my colleagues to the necessity of providing by legislation    for tho temporary continuance after the termination of tho    War f)  thoso Emergency Acts and Regulations which aro required    for the purposes of demobilisation and reconstruction,  I    submitted a Memorandum showing tho general polioy which,&apos; in tho    opinion of the Government Departments chiefly concerned; ought    to guide thorn in making proposals to tho Select Committee, then    sitting, with regard to the continuance of Regulations under    the Defence of the Realm Acts after the termination of the    War, and 1 obtained, through the Home Affairs Committee, to    which the Memorandum was referred, a general approval of the    line it was proposed to take, -         This was thought, at the time, to be sufficient,    but there has been a change in the situation which compels    me to bring the matter to the attention of my colleagues    again,         Tho Select Committee on Emergency Legislation    has ceased to exist with tho dissolution of Parliament, and    it has made a short Report to the effect that for want of    time it haa been unable to deal with the part of its reference    which required it to consider and report &quot;what provision
should &quot;be made for extending in whole or in part, or shortening,tho period cf operation of the several Emergency Statutes, andthe several regulations made thereunder,&quot;  They say that&quot;tho dissolution of the present Parliament has left insufficient&quot;&quot;time at their disposal adequately to explore tho numerous and&quot;&quot;intricate questions involved, or to hear tho views of persons&quot; -&quot;affected,&quot;     As to future procedure, the Committee recommend &quot;that a&quot;&quot;New Select Committee should bo set up immediately on the meeting&quot;of tho new Parliament, to continue the inquiry which it has been&quot;Impossible to complete, and tq examine the questions involved&quot;&quot;in these emergency Statutes and Regulations in detail     They recognise, however, that &quot;if tho ratification of&quot;&quot;the Peace Treaty were reached at an early date, some extension&quot;&quot;of those Statutes and regulations, other than thoso which the&quot;&quot;Departments are ready forthwith to drop, might become necessary&quot;&quot;In order to give the new Select Committee and Parliament a&quot;&quot;reasonable time for consideration,&quot; but they make no suggestion as to how this extension is to be.obtained.     This appears to me a serious omission, which cannotsafely be allowed to pass.  If an extension of Acts and regulations is necetsary, legislation will, of course, berequired, and Parliament may not be in a position to legislate.     By appointing a Select Committee, the House of Commons  -has signified that it requires advice and assistance to enable it to deal comprehensively with a question which involves somuch detail, and covers so wide a range; and, as the Committeehas not had time to dp its work, I am obliged to ask mycolleagues to consider what steps should be tak*n to providethe required assistance,     The date qf the end of the War cannot bo determinedby Parliamentary convenient.  The Termination of the Present
tWar (Definition) Act, which haa flust been passed,  onaoles HisMajesty in Council to declare the date of the termination of thepresent War, but the date declared must be &quot;as nearly as may bo&quot;the date of the exchange or deposit of ratifications of thetreaty or treaties of peace.     It is not possible to predict, even approximately,what that date will be.  It may, of course, be co longdeferred as to allow time for a new Parliament to appointanother Committee, and wait for Its Report before considering what legislation is needed; but certainly it would not be prudent to rely on such a contingency, because a veryserious situation would arise if the War should end, andthe great body of omergenoy Acts and Regulations shouldlapse, before Parliament had provided for the continuanceof such    them a3 are necessary.     I therefore think it is essential that  some other and more expeditious means should  at once be adopted in  orderto ensure that the Government and  tha Country are not  taken bysurprise *     The question to be  considered, although concernedwith Acts and Regulations, is not  so much legal as practical,and could not properly be referred to such.a body as Mr,Justice Athin&apos;e Committee *   As  regards especially thepowers of Government Departments,  only those who have  beenexercising the powers conferred by Acts  and Regulations,  andactively engaged in  the  administration of  the  Orders made underthem,  can fully understand tho  necessities  of  the case,   On theother  hand,  there are Emergency.&apos;Statutes of :another kind whichTjemporarily  alter the rights  of individuals imder the  generallaw,   Further,  I think.the views  of those  actually  engaged in administrative work  ought  to be subjected  to the  test  ofcritieiam from  the wider point  of  view of  Parliamentary&apos;experience *                              5,
RECOMMENDATIONS       Under the circumstances above derailed I suggest that aCommittee should be appointed composed of representatives of theGovernment Departments which are principally concerned with theadministration of emergency powers, such as the Admiralty, theArmy Council, the Home Officej the Ministry of Munitions an.d theBoard of Trade; with the addition of a representative of thelord Chancellor., as concerned with such legislation as the CourtsEmergency Powers Acts which alter the general law; and also arepresentative of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Toprovide the wider point of view to which I have referred, theCommittee ought, I think, to be presided over by an independent chairman of Cabinet rank, who should, ii possible, combine legal                                                    iknowledge with the Parliamentary experience he will, of oourse,possess.        The Committee vvculd bo asked to make detailed proposalsshowing exactly what enactments, Regulations and Orders must, intheir opinion, be continued in force after the termination  of theWar, and in each case for how long,  Such proposals might properlytake the form of a 3111, on the linos of an Expiring Daws Con-tlnuance Act, with Schedules., in which the several Acts, regulations and Orders, with the necessary amendments, would be classifiedaccording to the period of their extension.          If such a Report were in the hands of the Government,the situation would be saved, because, if necessary, it would notbe unreasonable to invite Parliament to paas an Aot based on suchdetailed and authoritative proposals.  On the other hand, if timeallowed, it might still be thought desirable to refer the Reportto a Select Committee, and probably this would not involve muchdelay because the work to be done would have been greatly reduced. -                               (SGD) Christopher Addison,                                            28,11,18
