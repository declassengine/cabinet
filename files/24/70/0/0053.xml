The Committee  decided in favour of the immediate  repeal of theRegulations in the appended list.  It is probable that, when  the terms  ofthe Armistioe have been  carried out, it will be possible to dispense withother Regulations.      It will be noticed that the Regulations proposed  for  repeal  includeRegulation 40D., which has been the nubjeot of much controversy.   LordMoulton, the Chairman of the Committee appointed by the Cabinet to consider this Regulation, has addressed to the Rome Secretary the letter of which acopy is appended; and the Committee agree that, as hostilities have nowceased, the Regulation may be withdrawn.

Dear Viscount Cave,                            Commission on Regulation 40 D.          In view of the announcement that a Committee has been appointed  to    consider which of the Regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act should
 be  repealed.  I  have thought  it  advisable to take the opinion of the members of  the  above  Commission,  of  which  I  am the Chairman, as to the course which we  should  take  in  reporting  to  the Government  on the subject referred to us.      They are  unanimously of opinion that in  view  of the advent of peace it  is desirable that the  Regulation  should be  dropped altogether.  It is  , of  so special a kind that the justification put forward for its enactment is  based upon the  necessities created by the existence of a state of war. Its provisions  are strongly  objected to by a large  portion of the civil population on account  of  its affecting women only and for other reasons and this state  of  feeling will  become&apos; still more acute if it is kept in force after the state  of  Y/ar lias ceased.  They recommend, therefore, that it  should  be  dropped altogether without delay.      The  evidence that we have already taken  shows that some of the main provisions of Regulation  40  D are  of little or no effect and that in any case considerable  alterations would  have to be recommended.  But before the Committee  oould report on the whole  question further evidence would have to be  taken and  this  would occupy  considerable time and during this period the Regulation in its  present shape would remain in force.  This all the members of  the  Commission  deem undesirable now that the special circumstances which existed at the  date  of its enactment have so greatly changed.      The  Regulation deals only with a small part of a very much wider question which  can alone  be  dealt with by General Legislation and the solution of that question would not  be assisted, in their opinion, by the,Regulation being maintained  in  force any longer.                          Yours  very  sincerely,                                     IviOULTON.
