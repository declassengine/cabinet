(This  Document  is  the joroparty of His Jritennic  Majesty&apos;Government)  *A R   0 A B I N E T.632222.  5      EIJSCTRIOAL  POWER__SUPPLY.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION.(1)  I have received, from the Committee of Chairmen of myAdvisory Council, their well considered views on the wideradministrative issues arising out of the Report of theCommittee on Electric Fewer Supply, appointed by the Boardof Trade and presided over by Sir Archibald Williamson. A copyof the chairman Report is attached hereto.  These views 1 am anxious to commend to the Cabinet, briefly comparing at the sametime the recommendations of the two Committees.       (2)  It is shown in the Report of Sir Archibald. Williamson1s       Committee that, in the area of Greater London alone, there areiamson  some 70 Generating Stations owned by as many differentittee.  Authorities, and. employing 60 different systems., 10 different&apos;       frequencies, and 24 different voltages; while in the whole       country there are not less than 600 bodies generating       Electricity for public purposes.      The Report adds that &quot;investigation confirms fully theopinion of the Coal Conservation Sub-committee before and the electrical Trades Committee regarding prevailing conditions, andleads us unanimously to tho conclusion that the present state ofaffairs is contrary to national interests, wasteful of fuelresources, and handicaps industries in their compcition withother countries.(3)  With regard to economies which should be effected, by a combined system of generation, the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee say in their Report, &quot;The coal so saved would besufficient to generate continously not less than 15,000,000 tup.&quot;while the Electrical Trades Committee say &quot;The items which are capable oftreasonable calculation, such as saving in fuel, re-duct ion in factory cost, and increased output, will togetherrepresent not less than  100,00^000 per annurru(4)  In order to bring such a impneved system into&apos; operation,Sir Archibald Williamson&apos;s Committee make the following recommendations:-1.That a body of five Commissioners should bo setup to have control over the generation and dis-tribution of Electricity in the united Kingdom,2,That the existing system under which Electricityis separately generated, for small areas, should.be abolished, and that in its place theCommissioners should divide the Kingdom into some16 districts, technically suitable for economicalgeneration and distribution.3.  That in each Electrical district, a Board should    be set up  iflhich should purchase all public    Generating Stations/ whether from Local Authori-    ties or from Power Companies, and    responsible for the establishment    Stations, and for a proper system should beof new Generatingof
            transmission mains in its district.       IV.  That distribution, on the other hand,  should continue            to be carried out by the existing undertakings,  which            should purchase their current in bulk  from the District            Boards.            That these District Boards might be  of three types:-                       Those Nationally financed.                       Those locally financed.                       Those financed by a combination of both                               those systems.            (i)  Boards which aro nationally financed should be                  &quot; &quot;compos eIT&quot;of&quot;representa^ves  of&quot;:&quot;-&quot;                    (a)  Local Authorities and Companies which are                         at present distributors of electricity.                    (b)  Large consumers.                    (c)  Railways using electricity within tho                         district of the Board,            (ii) Boards which aro locally financed should be                   compos eoTo? representatives&apos; of  : -                    (a)  Local Authorities, whether distributors of                         electricity or not.                    (b)  Companies which are at present distributors                         of electricity.                    (c)  Large consumers.                    (d)  Railways using electricity within the                         district of the Board.            (iii)Mixed Boards  should be composed  of the representa-                      ives  of the interests mentioned in  (i)  and                      (ii) according  to the relative proportions  of                     financial support provided from Local and                     Hational s ourc e s,        (5)  While agreeing  emphatically that Electric Power  shouldRoport  be generated on a National System, my Chairmen are in doubtof the  whether  the Administrative Machibery recommended by SirChair-  Archibald Williamson1s Committee would, in  fact, operatemen^   with sufficient speed,  and  efficiency, remembering  alwaysbmmitteethat If  the opportunity which arises  after  the War is  lost,       the  defects of  the  existing  system will continue to multiply       and  will become permanent.    They regard as a drawback the       dual system of  finance apparently contemplated in  the       Williamson Report,  and they  also point out  that, if the       credit  of local rates  were in any case involved, in such a        scheme,  the preponderating power  of  the Local Board would have.       to reside with  the Ratepayers,  Involving all  the intricacies        of Local Government  areas  and other  paraochial considerations.     ,  (6)  My  Chairmen  therefore recommended: *-            1,  That electrical  power should be generated  and                transmitted throughout the  United  Kingdom  upon a                single  unified system,  organised and  conducted                upon commercial  lines,  under State  regulation &apos;                and with  such financial co-operation  on  the A               part of the  State  as may  be  found  necessary  in v*               order  to  secure  the  speedy  development  of  an                effective system of  electric supply throughout                the Kingdom,
ItII,    (a)  That an Electricity Board  should  to  appointed          to devise &quot;and supervise  the  carrying out  of          a national  scheme upon tho above  linos.      (b)  That the B^ard should be empowered  to appoint          an &quot;Operating Executive,T,  consisting of men          cf the  highest qualifications  and competence          from the technical and business point of  view,          with fiill executive authority  for the technical          execution and management of  the actual busi-          ness upon strictly commercial  lines.          It might be expected that  the  &quot;Operating          Executive&quot;  would appoint a manager  or managers          of each Central Station  or area of  supply,  in          which case  a Local Consultative Committee          might be attached to the  management.      (c)  That the Electricity Board should be endowed          with such general powers as  may be  necessary          for carrying out a national  scheme  as suggest-          ed in paragraphs 29, 32,  71, 76 and  79 ofSir          Archibald Williams on&apos;s Report.      (d)  That in view of the financial  liabilities  tc          bo undertaken by tho State,  suitable provision          should bo made for an adequate measure of          Parliamentary control ovor tho financial          operations  rf the Board.      (e)  That in order to protect tho interests of the          Public, the President of the Board  should be          empowered to issue such Regulations in          cmneetlon  with electrical supply as might  te          found necessary.III.   That the standard price  for  current  should  ts      allowed to vary as between :ne  area  of  supnly  and      another, since it would not  be  commercially sound      to supply current at a uniform  rate  fcr all areas      independently of the conditions ,of demand,  or  the      circumstances attending supply.         IV.   That the Electricity Board should be left absolutely               free to consider and deal with the whole problem of               electrical supply - including distribution as well               as generation and main line transmission.(7)      My Chairmen consider that the dead weight capital commit-ment which would be incurred by the State in respect of obsoleteplant and stations which have to be closed down,  has perhaps been somewhat unduly oxaggorated, when regard is had to the  magnitude of the issues involved.  The Williamson Report mentions  91,000,000as the capital at present invested in public electricity enterprisesin the United Kingdom; but of this sum I am informed that onlyscmo  45,000,000 aro represented by generating plant, the balancebeing accounted for by the plant required for distribution.&apos;  And Iam told that the valuo of the plant which would be found to beobsolete or unsuitable would probably not exceed  11,000,000.
(0)    They conclude by saying that it must not be assumed  that-because they regard the intervention of the  State in acommercial capacity in this particular field as essential atthis time to the necessary development of national resources,they aro in any way committed to approval of nationalisation of means of production as a principle;  or that their  proposalscan be regarded as forming a precedent  for State control or inter- _J0f   (9)    It is only rightividual Chairmen,  Mr.  Lionel.rmen.   the  recommendationsvent ion in other fields, where the circumstances are wholly diff-orent and the ground is already very fully occupied by theactivities of other authorities or agencies of long standing.Equally thoy think that it ought not to &quot;be assumed that it isimpossible for a State organisation to operate effectually in afield of commercial enterprise upun methods analogous to thoseadopted in ordinary bus-thatI should say here  that ono of my   &quot; -1s himself unable to concurinofhis colleagues; since he believes Stateownership and State management to be alike unsound;  and  thatwhile Sir Clarendon Hyde approves of a National System of genera-tion, with trunk transmission lines, ho disapproves  of compulsory purchase and considers that tho duty of distribution should beleft to private enterprise.(10)   Mr,  Leslie Scott writes as follows:-&quot;The State,Tas a lastshould not be brought into Industry exceptresort, and onlv if it is certain that son?&quot;necessary public requirement cannot bo met by private&quot;enterprise.  It is because I see no possibility of&quot;developing a supply of electricity for power purposes&quot;in undeveloped or industrially backward areas,  and&quot;particularly in agricultural areas, through private&quot;initiative, that I reluctantly, though whole-heartedly,&quot;support the plan proposed in the Report&quot;.irandum  (II)   The urgency  of an TEe    Memorandum which I haveCabinet Committee,     They stat       in the large  industrial       many  Power Stations are       to its detriment;  that       well  in hand  for after-       check the installationidlylit toe immediate decision is emphasised by a received from the War Cabinet Priority J that certain extensions, more particularly areas, must be authorised at once; that being fully loaded up and plant over-rununless new Power Stations are ready, orthe-Lar demands, it will be difficult to of further private Generating Stations,numendtl2          )  Since the Reports of Sir Archibald Williamson^ Committee :.. of  and of my Chairmen were made, the Government has decided todnistor establish a &quot;Minis try of Supply.    Before this decision, it appearedjgon-  to me- that the only Government Department to which we could make Uun. a body of Electricity Commissioners responsible,waB the Board of      Trade; but, inasmuch as the chiof function of any such body would      be to provide either directly or through Agents for the erection      and working of Power Stations and for the Supply of Current, it      appears to me that it ought to be attached to the Ministry of Supply,$      It furtherReports that thosystem of financeappears to me from a careful consideration of thosedistrict arrangements contemplated by and tho recommended by tho Williamson Committee would/                                          involve
tqa great delays in  &quot;bringing the  scheme  into operation in many districts requiring  its rapid development, and thatthey might in practice,  owing to  irreconcilable local interests, he found  unworkable .          v&apos;the re foro  roc ommend:-   (1).   Ifcat there should  be  established a unified national   scheme for the production and  transmission of  electric   power;   (2).   Tnat it should.be  administered  on  commercial lines   by a body composed  mainly of business  men appointed by and   responsible to the  Minister  of Supply  who should be   charged with the  responsibility for  the direction of this   ne w na t ional s o rv i ce ;   (&apos;6).   &apos;Biat the Minister  should bo empowered to appoint   operating executives  on the  lines  recommended  by my   Chairmen (recommendation  2 (b)) and  that  the Minister   and the bodies appointed  by&apos;him, as  may bo found nocess-   ary and appropriate,  should be provided with   general   powers for carrying out such&apos;a&apos; national ocheme as is   recommended in Paragraphs 29,  32,  71,  70  and 79 of   Sir Archibald Williamson^ Report;   (4),   &apos;hat the Minister  should be entitled to issue  such   regulations in connection with electricity supply as   might be  found to be  necessary; that the  standard prices   for current should, if necessary,  be allowed to vary as   between one area  and  another;   (5).   mat the Minister  shall be  le-ft free to consider   and deal with the whole problem of electrical  supply, includ-   iug distribution, as  well as generation,  and main line   transmission, as  may  prove to  be desirable or  necessary;   (6).   &apos;3hat in view of the urgent  need for increasing to   the utmost without delay  the productive oapacity of &quot;the   country, the  State should undertake  the responsibility   for financing the scheme.
            MINISTRY OF RBCOBSTRUCT ION.                ADVISORY COUNCIL.REPORT   of the CHAIRMEN on ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY.     To the Right Hon.  C3 Addison,  M9D0  M,Pe     Sir,1,         You were good enough to communicate to us  the  Report     of Sir Archibald Williamson1s Committee  on Electric Power     Supply, and to ask UB to submit such general comments or     suggestions on the broad administrative  and commercial     issues arising out of it, as might  seem  to us to be     pertinent in considering the questions of public policy     and of appropriate administrative machinery which came     before you in this connexion.  You subsequently intimated     that any Report wo might submit on  this  subject should     embrace incidentally answers to the following four questions:-     I.     Should electric Power be generated on a national            system?     II.    If so, should the supply of  current be at a uniform            price for all areas?     III.    Should distribution be nationally controlled, and,            if so, to what extent?     IV,    What administrative machinery should be devised            for a national system having regard to            (a)  the composition of the  Central Authority?            (b)  the composition and powers of the Local                 Authorities?            (c)  the relations between the Central and Local                 Authorities?2,         Vie have discussed this matter  at several meetings,     and have considered the Report of the Williamson Committee     in conjunction with the Report of the Board of Trade     Committee on Electrical Trades, and the  Interim Report of     the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee on Electric Power     Supply,  We have also considered a  number of other     memoranda on the same subject, and  have  had the advantage     of informal discussions with Sir John Snell and Sir John     Bradbury, as well as with certain officials of the     Ministry,,  We think we are now in a position to submit to     you certain general conclusions arising out of the evidence     which has come before us.30         Taking the first of the specific questions addressed     to us, viz: &quot;Should electric power  be generated on a     national system?&quot; We think the answer should clearly be     in the affirmative, The general arguments in favour of     some effectual co-ordination of the supply of eleotric     power in the United Kingdom are very clearly and forcibly     stated in certain passages of Sir Archibald Williamson&apos;s     Reportc  This Committee came unanimously to the conclusions-
(para 2 of the Report) -    &quot;(a)  That a highly important element in reducing          manufacturing costs will be the general exten-          sion of the use of Electric Power supplied at          the lowest possible price;     (b)  That the present system under which a supply of          electricity is provided in a large number of          small areas by separate authorities, is in-          compatible with anything that can now be          accepted as a technically sound system.     (o)  That a comprehensive system for the generation          of electricity, and, where necessary, reorganis-          ing its supply, should be established as soon          as possible,&quot;     They further recognised (para, 4) that their terms ofreference should be considered from a national point ofview, so that their recommendations might lead to apraotioal scheme for providing the vital requirements of cheap power throughout the country and stated that &quot;theextent to which electricity may be. further applied tomechanical production, to improved railway service, toelectro-chemical and metallurgical processes, to agri-oulture and to domestic labour-saving apparatus isaltogether incalculable.&quot;     After commenting on the legislative difficultieswhich have so far retarded the general development ofelectric power in the United Kingdom, they stated (para 11     &quot;It has been conclusively proved that a municipal or     &quot;Local Government area is not necessarily, and in     &quot;fact is rarely, the most economical area of     &quot;electrical supply.&quot;They further point out that - (para 21) -     &quot;There are to-day about 600 bodies generating     &quot;electricity for public purposes, apart from the     &quot;large number of manufacturers, collieries, and     &quot;others generating their own power. Most of these     &quot;independent small plants involve an unnecessary     &quot;expenditure of capital and comparative waste of     &quot;fuel and labour.  The parochial system of generation     &quot;and distribution should give place to more economi-     &quot;cal methods, involving wider areas of distribution,     &quot;and the combination of diverse kinds of industry,     &quot;in order to obtain-the fullest use of larger     &quot;generating plant.&quot;     They stated it as &quot;an axiom that, in order to ensure a cheap supply of electric power for all consumers in industrial districts, all should unite in taking their supply from a common system,&quot;     The Reports of the Goal Conservation Sub-Committee(especially paragraph 1) and of the Board of trade committee on Electrical Trades (paragraphs &apos;5 to 12)
     similarly advance a number of considerations which point     to tho urgent necessity for Instituting a system of     generating electric power on a national scale, and under     national supervision adequate to meet the vast national     requirements in this matter, which have for many years     been inadequately supplied, owing to the lack of a properly     oo-ordinated national system for this purpose, *4.        So far we are in complete agreement with the general     view of Sir Archibald Williamson&apos;s Committee, but we very     much doubt whether the administrative machinery recommen-     ded in certain portions of their Report, would in fact,     operate with sufficient speed and efficiency to effect the     purpose in view. It must be recollected that immediately     on the termination of the present War, an opportunity will     arise for re-casting the whole of the existing arrangements     for the supply of electric power in the United Kingdom on     a comprehensive and practical basis; but, if the necessary     administrative machinery is not immediately created, or     if created, is not of a character that can promptly and     efficiently deal with all immediate demands in a manner     calculated to secure the maximum developments of electric     power supply in this country, this opportunity will be     lost, and the defects of the existing system will go on     multiplying and become permanent,5,        A main drawback to the administrative system recommen-     ded in the Williamson Report appears to us to lie in the     dual system of finance apparently contemplated (see para     92) for the District Electricity Boards, which are under     these proposals to be the owners of tho generating plant,     and in effect the responsible administrators of the system     in each of the 16 districts Into which it is proposed to     divide the United Kingdom for this purpose.          Some of these Boards, it is proposed are to be     financed nationally, others are to be locally financed,     and others again financed under a mixture of the two     systems.  The precise constitution of the District Board     in each case will depend upon the system of finance     adopted in each case. It is apparently anticipated that,     in certain of the districts, where electric power has     reached a comparatively high standard of development,     little difficulty will be found in obtaining any necessary     capital facilities for the further development of the     area from local financial resources. In other districts  ,     wit may be necessary to finance the Boards in whole or in     part by funds raised with Government assistance.&quot;          It seems to us that this somewhat heterogeneous     system of Finance would be highly unsatisfactory, and     would militate against the uniformity of administration     and accurate comparison of methods, which would be     necessary for a well thought out scheme of national     development,          A further result of this system would apparently be &apos;     that, in the cases where national financial assistance     was invoked, public funds would be committed only to the     development of those areas which present the least     promising propositions commercially, with the result that
grants made by the State for thie purpose would be in thenature of doles to backward areas rather than of co-operation in a comprehensive scheme on a scale and under conditions which might reasonably operate to the finan-cial advantage both of the nation at large and of thelocal community.     We further have grave doubt whether the DistrictBoards, to be set up under the system thus proposed,would in fact be so countituted as to be efficientadministrators of the difficult and technical businessoperations involved in the development of electrical powersupply.  It is clear that, if the credit of the local rates were in any case involved in such a scheme, thepreponderating power in the local Board of Managementwould have to reside with the local ratepayers, and thewhole system woula become involved in the intricacies ofLocal Government areas and parochial considerations towhich the Williamson Committee attribute, in a largedegree, the present deficiencies In the matter of electricsupply in this country.  It is indeed essential that, for efficient management, a business of this nature shouldbe concentrated In a small number of hands with highcommercial or technical qualifications, and such a boardof management could not reasonably be expected to result from the system of Electrical bodies, indicated Inparagraph 54 of the Williamson Report.     It seems to us, indeed, that the main hope of efficient management under such a system of DistrictBoards would lie In the possibility of their entering into satisfactory leases with competent Public UtilityCompanies, or undertakings managed on a strictlycommercial basis. It has, accordingly, been suggested,and strongly pressed,  in the course of our  discussions that a more satisfactory general scheme would  be  for theElectricity Commissioners to grant franchises  for thegeneration and  supply  of electricity within the areasinto which they divide  the United Kingdom,  to  PublicUtility Companies operating under a special charter forthis purpose with a  strict limitation of dividends.  Themajority  of us  are,  however, of  opinion  that  the  transferof existing Municipal  undertakings to Public  UtilityCompanies would meet with strong and  irreconcilable public and Parliamentary opposition.  We further  consider  thatthe limitation  of dividends would,  in fact,  remove  the strongest guarantee  for that  initiative  and progressivemanagement which  is  the main argument in favour of transferring those undertakings  to Public  Utility Companies.     We  think,  moreover, that under any  of the systems  offinance  indicated above,  the  installation.of new  and efficient generating plant, and  the creation of largegenerating stations, would  Inevitably take place  at tooalow  and  too uncertain a  rate to keep pace with thepossibilities of demand which will  arise  at the end ofthe War,  and that  such installations  as  were  erected,would  be  deprived  of the  element of  interchangeability  and inter--dependence, which is universally  regarded as  one  ofthe highest  importance.   This, we  feel,  will be particularly,&apos;the case  with what may be termed &quot;backward areas&quot;,  i.e.
      areas which have not reached a high state of industrial      development, hut in which the demands for example,  of      agriculture, open one of the most promising and,  from the      national point of view, important fields for the  increased      use of electric power as a means of extending the      productive resources of the nation. 9,        We have, accordingly, come to the conclusion that      any comprehensive and efficient system for the develop-      raent of electrical generation and main line transmission      in the United Kingdom must be not only a national system,      but a single unified system, under State regulation,  and      in the financing of which the State would participate      upon a large scale.  In our opinion, the State would find      it far easier to assist with capital or with credit,  one      consolidated enterprise than a number of separate      Corporations or District Authorities, differing from each      other in constitution, and acting independently of each      other. Similarly, in the case of a single body, the Mate      would be better able to prescribe regulations, and to      exercise effective control for the protection of the      Public against possible abuses of a monopoly.           Such a unified national scheme as we have in view      should be framed and administered throughout upon a      definitely commercial basis; and not, in any sense, upon      Civil Service lines.  To this point we attach the highest      possible importance.10.        In speaking of the scheme as being conducted &quot;on a      commercial basisw,, v/e contemplate that electric current      would be supplied to the consumer at a fair commercial      price; and we believe that the price at which such supply      can be made under a national system of the kind we are      prepared to recommend, would be more favourable to the      consumer than that afforded by any other possible agency.           We do not understand the recommendations of the      Committees, whose Reports we have under review, to the      effect that &quot;electrical power should be supplied at the      lowest possible price&quot; as implying that the price of      current should be fixed in such a manner as to constitute      a direct State subsidy to particular traders or other      classes of the community making use of such Power, We      think indeed that it is essential to the healthy develop-      ment of any scheme that it should be based on a system of      bona-fide commercial co-operation between the State and      the members of the community particularly affected rather      than on any system of nationalisation, as ordinarily      understood, or of State doles to particular interests.11.        If the result of the State taking action upon the      comprehensive scale we have in view were to enable      current to be supplied at a lower rate than would be      possible by any other means, we think the State would be      justified in securing in one form or another, a partici-      pation in any profits which might result from the      business.  So far as the scheme is based upon the credit      of the general body of Tax-payers, any margin available      from the conduct of the operations upon an ordinary fair      and commercial footing, might justly be available for      the nation at large.
          From such lmow3.ed.ge as we possess,  we consider that     it should be possible to supply current  in different     areas at rates highly favourable to consumers of power in     comparison with present rates, either for electric     current or for any. other sources of power; and, at the     same time, provide for interest upon capital, for     renewals of plant and amortization, and  allow of a     balance being carried to a Reserve Fund  vrtiich would     constitute a valuable asset, and which might be used,     inter alia, for the development of backward districts.          We think that any scheme of State ownership or     participation, based upon such commercial management,     should look for and endeavour to secure  the result we     have just indicated.12,       We feel we ought at once to deal with two main and     general objections to any commitment of State credit or     capital in an undertaking of this kind,  which inevitably     arise, and which can only be satisfactorily met by very     special considerations or special arrangements in the     particular case     fa)  It is urged with much force by Sir John Bradbury          among others, that in view of the hea&quot;?ry capital          commitments of the nation at the end of the War,          State assistance, by way of loan or capital guarantee          could only bo contemplated in the case of a very          limited number of services of vital importance to          the national existence, for which effectual pro-          vision cannot be made by any other means, and that          any fresh issues of capital for general purposes  of          national development or social amelioration should          be strenuously avoided, pending a re-accumulation of          bona-fide capital by way of savings,     fb)  It has also been urged on the other hand, that any          State participation financially in a scheme of this          nature would, necessarily, be attended by a close          measure of administrative Treasury supervision, and          the submission of annual estimates to Parliament,          which would, in fact, gravely hamper the economic          development of the scheme on ordinary commercial          lines.          In regard to the first point  fa) we would observe     that the development of electric power for productive     purposes promises to be in the immediate future such a     vitally important element in the re-constitution of the     nationTs commercial and agricultural resources, that an     application for some measure of assistance from public     credit in this case stands upon an altogether exceptional     footing. In all highly civilised and progressive     countries electric power represents today a source of     energy for productive purposes, which is without.     parallel in the history of the world.  The development of     such power in the United Kingdom (which has comparatively     limited resources in the matter of water power) is at     present in its infancy. It is well-known that the greater     use of electrical machinery in certain parts of Amerioa j
 gives  a  greater product to each raan&apos;s labour.  The possibilities  of  increased national wealth frora a full development  of this power, though based on entirely substantial  and scientific data, are altogether incal- culable.  On  the other hand, the national loss of the present  opportunity for securing a maximum development of electric  power, if inadequately utilised, may be inferred from paragraph 8  of the Report of the Committee on Electrical Trades, which  states that     &quot;Witnesses of high authority estimate the loss     &quot;incurred by the nation through failure to take full     &quot;advantage of electrical progress at not less than     &quot; 100,000,000 a year, a loss preventable by     &quot;concentrating generation under improved adminis-     &quot;tration.&quot;     We  fully recognise that the erection of large central generating stations, and  the laying down of the necessary main trunk transmission lines will involve a heavy initial  expenditure of capital. But this, we think  can be provided  upon  sound commercial lines, with the assistance of  the State,  more advantageously than by any other  means, without any  undesirable overstrain of national  credit.     An  initial difficulty in the way of a unified system  - of State  ownership and control of generating plant, which appears  to have deterred  others, who have advised upon this subject,  from recommending the immediate adoption of a really  national system, is the dead weight capital commitment to  be  incurred by the State in taking over existing  capital  liabilities of other Authorities in respect of obsolete plant and stations which may have to be closed down.   This difficulty, however, may be (and, so far as we can  judge, has been) unduly exaggerated, having regard  to  the magnitude of the main issues involved. We gather, from certain general statements made by Sir John Snell,  that  of the  91,000,000 (mentioned in paragraph 72 of the Williamson Report) as representing the capital  at present invested in public Electricity enterprises  in the United Kingdom, not more than  45,000,000  approximately are invested in generating plant and existing generating stations (the balance being represented  by distributing plant).  Of this amount approximately  three quarters is said to represent comparatively  efficient plant, and the total amount representing obsolete plant, or commitments on generating stations which might have to be closed down, would not exceed approximately  11,000,0000  Against this latter sum,  moreover,  an appreciable effect might be realisedby the disposal of   land  and   buildings, and by sale of boilers and certain other plant for other purposes.. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that the necessary provision for  the amortization of the dead weight capital- liability thus taken over, should be a comparatively simple incident in the financing of a comprehensive scheme upon the scale and under the conditions which wehave  indicated.     As regards (b),  we rcould observe that financial
     provision for a loan or guarantee based on national credit,     for a definite capital scheme of limited extent, does not     necessarily involve the same degree of direct and detail-     ed Parliamentary supervision by way of annual estimates     as the ordinary expenditure of money on current admini-     strative services which are not of a directly remunerative     nature.  Vie have already stated that the scheme we have     in view would be framed and administered throughout upon     strictly commercial lines, and that commercial accounts     would he kept of the whole undertaking.          The administration of any necessary loans, and the     issue of capital sums from time to time, under powers     granted by Parliament for such loans, would under     arrangements (which will presently be indicated) be     carried out under Treasury supervision in the ordinary     course,14.       We cone now to the seoond of the specific questions     which you desire us to Include in our Report, viz ;-     &quot;whether the supply of current shall be at a uniform     price for all areas&quot;.          We recognise that, in areas which are highly     developed industrially, the whole position as regards     the supply of electric current by whatever agency, is very     different from that obtaining in less developed areas. To     supply current at a uniform rate for all areas, independent-     ly of the conditions of demand or the cirotunstances     attending supply, would not be commercially sound, and     could not be reasonably expected.  Our reply, therefore,     is, that the standard price charged for electric current     would necessarily vary as between one area of supply and     another.15.       The third question to which you ask us to reply is     &quot;Should distribution be nationally controlled, and if so,     to what extent          This question is, in our opinion, one of greater     difficulty and complexity than the question of generation,     and only permits of a somewhat general answer in default     of the working out of a complete and detailed scheme. It     seems to us obvious that, if generating plant is nationally     owned-or controlled, the main transmission lines should     also be nationally owned or controlled.  So far we are     quite clear; but, when we come to the local distribution     of current to consumers, we find ourselves confronted with     existing agencies - whether municipalities, local     authorities or public companies - which in many areas     occupy the ground, and have established rights and     obligations. It seems to us it was the presence in the     field of those agencies which create so powerful an effect     upon the minds of Sir Archibald Williamson1s Committee as     to deflect them from the formulation of a truly national     scheme. We fully admit they cannot be ignored. If there     is to be a national scheme, they must be dealt with, and     means must be found to build them into that scheme.16.       It might be said &quot;let the State Authority confine     itself to the generation and trunk transmission of
     current to  the  proper areas  for  distribution and  leave     the  actual  task of distribution  to  municipal or commercial     agencies.&apos;1  We do not consider that  any such clean-cut     division of functions is either  practicable or desirable.     We think the Electricity Board,  whose appointment we     recommend in the next paragraph,  should be  left absolutely     free to consider and deal with the  whole problem  of     electrical  supply, including distribution.  In some     distriots,  and  more particularly in new areas, they might     find it necessary to keep it in  their own hands from the     outset; in others they might think  it necessary to take     over existing undertakings upon  terms to be agreed upon;     in others again they might - and probably would - find  it     preferable  to leave it in the hands of existing bodies, or     appropriate groups of them,  where they were efficient  and     progressive. In the latter case  it  would be a matter of     negotiation, and it ought not to be difficult to  bring     about mutually satisfactory  arrangements, Existing agencies     would secure a supply of current at a lower cost  than  that     at which they are now generating it, arid the Control     Authority would obtain the local co-operation of  those who     have a definite interest in  extending the area of supply.     It would, of course, be necessary to provide in the     eontractB under which current was supplied  to the dis-     tributing bodies - inter alia -  that some maximum limit     should be fixed to the prices at which they retailed  it     to customers, and to make provision for the progressive     development of the dietributory  system. It  must always be     remembered that a low cost of generation largely  depends     upon high output, and for this reason the interest of  the     Central Generating Authority must always lie in the     direction of active, efficient and  successful distribution,17,        As regards the reply to the fourth of  the questions     which you desire us to answer (relative to  the nature  of     a suitable administrative machinery for a national system,     the composition of the Central Authority and Its  relations     with any subsidiary authorities  that might  be established     in connexion with the scheme) we think it very desirable     to place any Central Authority that may be  set up in as     strong and independent a position as possible for the     devising and promotion of a scheme  for the  development of     electrical supply in the United Kingdom; and we think it     essential that they should be left  a very wide latitude     as regards the mode of organisation.          We do not consider that the constitution of the     Electrical Commission, as suggested in paragraphs 29 and     30 of the Williamson Report, is  suitable for the  scheme     we have in view.          We recommend the appointment of an Electrloity Board,     consisting of six members, selected from men of proved     business capacity and experience of affairs, accustomed to     handle large commercial undertakings.
       As  regards  the terms of appointment and remuneration  of the members of the Board, it appears highly questionable  whether  first class men in the full tide of success in  private  business would be prepared to devote their whole time  to  such  duties for salaries even of  3,000 a year (as  suggested in paragraph 30 of the Williamson Report).  On the  other hand,  if gentlemen were selected who were  contemplating  retirement from private business,  the proposals  in that  paragraph regarding pensions might tend to saddle the undertake with an undue proportion of non-effective  charges.      We  therefore think that the Chairman  should be  appointed for a term of five years, and should receive an  honorarium sufficient  to obtain the services of  a really first  class man, while the remaining members should normally be appointed for periods  of three to  five years, and should be paid the equivalent  of Directors1  fees on  a high scale for time actually devoted  to the work  of the Commission.  In  order to secure a  regular  flow of fresh  blood, it  might be  desirable that two  should  retire annually after the  first  three  years of the undertaking)  i.e.  that  of the original selection  two should be appointed  for three  years,  two for four years  and  the remaining two (including the Chairman)  for five  years. Retiring members  might be  eligible  for  re-appointment in  suitable cases, and the  original  constitution  of the Commission  might  be reviewed  if  necessary  at  the end of the  first five years  of the undertaking.      In  view of the  financial  liability to  be undertaken  by the State, it  i3  clear that some control must be  exercised by Parliament over the  financial  operations of  the Board; and the question  is  how this can be  combined with  effective commercial management.      The  most  important source  of control will,   obviously, be  the power  of Parliament to refuse loans,  or to  impose conditions in  connection with them.     We also  recognise that regulations will be necessary to  ensure that the undertaking  is managed with due regard to  the requirements and interests of the Public.  We suggest that such regulations should be made by the President of theBoard of  Trade.     The  first duty of the Electricity Board would be to plan out  a coraprehensive scheme for the whole country, and then by degrees to secure the development of electrical power over the whole of the United Kingdom by such methods as they might find suitable to the particular  requirements of different areas. It would be part of their  business tonegotiate with existing interests and to come to  terms withthem.     They should  be endowed with such powers as may benecessary for carrying out a national scheme, as  suggested inparagraphs 29, 32, 71 and 76 to 79  of Sir ArchibaldYi/Illiamson&apos;s Report.     In order to give effect to their schemes, we recommendthat the Board should be empowered  to create an &quot;Operating
       Executive&quot; to whioh full executive authority and responsibility       for the technical execution and management of the scheme or       schemes should be entrusted.            The actual constitution of this &quot;Operating Executive&quot;       and the appropriate methods for financing the scheme in detail       are matters which-, in our opinion, can only be satisfactorily       determined by the Board itself,, when its plans have reached       a certain degree of maturity. Obviously, the men appointed       to the Kxeoutive should be men of the highest qualifications       and competence from the technical and business point of view.       They would be in effect managers directing and controlling  a       great business organisation,  and would command very high       salaries, or salaries supplemented by commission.            There is one principle in connection with the &quot;operating       Executive&quot; constituted under the Electricity Board,  to       which we attach the highest importance. It should be       oobstituted and conduct its operations on a strictly       commercial basis, Proper Capital and Profit and Loss Accounts       should be kept and rendered periodically to the Electricity       Board for submission to the Treasury and Parliament, The staff       should be in all its branches, both as to appointment  and       remuneration, a commercial staff,  organised upon commercial       and not upon Civil Service lines,24,         The &quot;Operating Executive&quot; would no doubt appoint  a manager       and staff for each area or Central Station, and it is  to the       emulation between these managers that they would look  for that       stimulating rivalry and competition which is generally absent       from the undertakings of Public Bodies. It would probably       be found convenient to secure a Local Consultative Committee       in each area of supply.in order to keep the managers in touch       with their customers.            What you would in effect have would be a network  of       interconnected businesses carried on in friendly rivalry with       each other,  but co-ordinated as to general policy and  financial       control by a Central Exeoutive, which would itself be       responsible to the Electricity Board.25,         We do not think we can usefully go further into detail       at this point, or elaborate any exhaustive scheme for  the       constitution and procedure of the  Electricity Board,  or their       &quot;Operating Executive&quot;,            We have been asked to report  in general terms on  certain       broad and practical issues affecting the development of       Electrical Power in the United Kingdom, We think it  essential       to the efficient development  of such power that the Board       appointed to undertake the task should be left with  a  very  free       hand to devise their own system. We are fully alive  to the       intricacies  of the subject,  and to the practical difficulties       of putting in operation any comprehensive system on  the       lines which  we have indicated,  but we think that,  in view of       the va3t importance of the issues  and of the opportunity of       securing effectual and substantial national development in  a       field where  the ground is not already too greatly encumbered,       to admit of a fresh  start being made on a national scale, these       difficulties can and will be  overcome by inyelligent       co-operation between the State Authority and the various
Sections of the community concerned. We also recognise thatour proposals are in many respects novel,  and represent a new departure in the machinery of Government,  But we think thecomplexities and anomalies of the previous parochial systemwhioh have so far retarded tho development o&apos;f Electrioltyin the United Kingdom can and must he overcome,  and forthis purpose it is necessary to approach the question with an absolutely open mind, and to escape  from the tyranny ofcatchwords.     It must mot be assumed that, because we regard the intervention of the State in a commercial capacity in thisparticular field as essential at this time to the necessarydevelopment of national resources, that we are,  in any way committed to approval of nationalisation of means ofproduction as a principle, or that our proposals  can be regardedas forming a precedent for State control or intervention inother fields, where the circumstances are  wholly different,and the ground is already very fully occupied by theactivities of other authorities or agencies of longstanding. But equally, we think it ought not to  be assumed that it is impossible for a State organisation to operateeffectually in a field of commercial enterprise  upon methodsanalogous to those adopted in ordinary business.
SUMMARY  OJ?  RECOMMENDATIONS-:.1,   That electrical power should  be  generated  and  trans nitted     throughout  the United Kingdom upon  a  single  unified     jyaijem,  organised  and conducted  upon  commercial  lines,     under State regulation and  with  such  financial co-operation     on the part of the State  as may  be  found, necessary in order     to secure the speedy  development of an  effective system  of     electric supply throughout  the Kingdom.     (a)  That an TSlectrioity  Board should be appointed to de-          vise and. supervise the carrying  out of  a  national          scheme upon the  above  lines -  see  paragraphs 17-22.     (b)  That the Board should  be empowered to appoint an         &quot;Operating FA-ecutive? consisting  of men  of the high-          est qualifications and comnetence  from  the  technical          and business  point of  view,with  full  executive          authority for the technical execution and management          of the actual business,  upon strictly commercial lines -          see paragraph 23, It  might be expected that the          &quot;Operating Executive&quot;  would appoint a manager or mana-          gers of each  Central Station or  area  of supply, in          which  case a  Local Consultative  Committee might be          attached to the  management  - see paragraph  24.     (c)  That the Electricity Board  should  be  endowed with such          general powers as may  be necessary for  carrying out          a national scheme as suggested in  paragraphs 29, 32,          71,  78 and 79 of Sir Archibald Williamson&apos;s Renort.     (d)   That in view  of  the  financial  liabilities to be under-          taken  by the  State,  suitable provision  should be made          for  an  adequate  measure  of  Parliamentary  control over          the  financial operations  of the  Board,     (e)   That in order to protect  the interests  of the Public,          the  President of the Board &apos;should  be  empowered to          issue  such  Regulations in connection  with electrical          supply  as  might  be found  necessary.3.4That the standard price for current should be allowed to vary as between one area of supply and another, since Itwould not be commercially sound to supply current at a uni-form rate for all areas independently of the conditions of demand, or the circumstances attending supply.That the Electricity Board should be left absolutely free to consider and deal with the whole problem of electricalsupply - including distribution as well as generation and main line transmission.We have the nonour to be Sir,     lour obedient Servants,  HTTOY BIRCiraOUGH (Chairman]  ARTHUR A .  &amp;LLW .x CLARENDON  HYDE.

NOTE EROM MR. LESLIE scott.     In signing this renort, I desire particularly to emphasize the warning in Paragraph 24; that our proposalmust not he regarded as implying any general approval ofState Trading.  With Mr, Hichens1 general views, I stronglyagree. The State should not be brought into Industry except as a last resort,  and only if it is certain that some necessarjpublic requirement cannot be met by private enterprise.It is because I see no possibility of developing a supply ofelectricity for power purposes in undeveloped or industriallybackward areas, and particularly in Agricultural areas through!private initiative that I reluctantly though whole-heartedlysupport the plan proposed in the report.   It is to be noted &apos;that Mr. Hichens himself (paragraph 4 of  his note) recognizesthe necessity of State action in such areas.18.10.18.Leslie Scott.
DISSENTIENT MINUTE FROM SIR CLAR1WDON HYDE TO ONE  OF THE PARAGRAPHS OP TH1? ELECTRICITY REPORT.      Whilst  I  approve  of a  National  System  of &quot;Electrical Generation,  with  trunk transmission  lines,  I disapprove of compulsory purchase  of existing public undertakings.      Experience shows  that  compulsory purchase is a very expensive process. In  this  case mo3t of the plants are uneconomic,  and useless  for a National Scheme.      The duty  of  distribution should be entrusted to private enterprise,  regulated  only  as to the rates  to be charged.      In my view the  only  compulsory powers which the State should seek  should be;-    1.  That Local Authorities and Power Supply Companies        having monopoly areas, should be compelled to        take the  current  offered,&apos; if and so long as the        current is supplied at, say, one third less than        the average cost price of production by the Local        Authority, or Power Supply Company.    2.  Where no Public monopoly supply is already        authorised, Power should be granted to the        National Central Supply to erect Supply Stations,        to be leased to Local enterprise.     The supply of current at a considerable reduction on the local cost of production would enable the LocalAuthority Or Company out of its saving:-             To dispense with its Local generating staff;             To provide its Sinking Jftind;             To avoid further capital expenditure;             To supply the increasing local demands;             To maintain its local plant as a stand-by in             case of temporary failure,C.G.

MEMORANDUM BY MR.  W ,1.   HICHENS.Electric &quot;&quot;ower Supply,       I regret that I find myself in disagreement with  the  report on Electric Power Supply submitted by the Chairman&apos;s  Committee. Since the difference between us is fundamental  and  the issues   of   policy involved are of a far-reaching  character I hope I may be allowed very briefly to explain  the  reasons of my dissent.      The keystone of the report is National Ownership. This  policy I regard as unsound. State ownership,  I believe leads  inevitably to state control and state control to state  management. In my view state trading is unsound;  it  is for  the  State to lay down the conditions under which trade may be conducted and to see that they are carried out; but  it should not itself become a Trader. The National owner- ship of Power Supply may be the thin end  of the  wedge  and  once the principle is, established in this case It will be found equally applicable to Railways,  Canals  and  Mines,,      The reoort  recommends not  merely State Ownership  but also State  Management - with the proviso  that it  must  be conducted on  sound Commercial lines  -  a contradiction,  as I think in  terms.  State Management and Commercial Management must, I  believe,  in the nature  of things  be totally different,  and I  express  this view after  some considerable experience  of both. It  would  take too  long  to  develop  the point but in  a nut-shell  no  Parliament ever has,  or ever will, abdicate its control and  from  this  all  the  differences flow.    .  Again, the report  suggests  a uniformity  of administration and control which I deplore.  There must be ample  room  for development and experiments  on  various  lines  and  the essential uniformities are very few.  They  can be fully secured  in a charter of  incorporation  granted by the Electricity Commissioner and I believe there is  nothing to be gained by centralized administration - but very much to be lost.      One further point  of criticism. I believe it to  be of the greatest National importance that State borrowing should be reduced to the narrowest possible limits after the war, and for this reason I believe it to be sound in principle that  as much as possible should be left to private enterprise * so long as the public interests can be duly safeguarded; in this  case there can be no difficulty in providing adequate safeguards.  There is therefore no justification for pledging the credit of the State in respect of a class of enterprisewhich ought  to be self-supporting.      I am of opinion that the general lines of organization should be as follows (1)  There should be a central body of Electricity     Commissioners with wide powers under  the Board      of Trade whose duty it should be to lay down the
      general conditions under which a charter for the      supply of electric power may he granted,  and to      see that those conditions are carried out.  Speak-      ing generally they will have to see that  the      proposed districts are of the proper sizes;  that      the interests of all classes of consumers,  include      ing especially those in undeveloped areas of      the districts,  are safeguarded;  that such uniform!-      ty as is necessary between  one district and      another is observed;  that due efficiency and  economy      are maintained. They will also arrange for an      interchange  of experience and ideas by periodical      meetings of  representatives  from the different      districts.( )   Having formulated as  soon as  possible the general      conditions under  which  they are  prepared to  grant      a  charter, the  Electricity Commissioners should      make  it  clear that  the  responsibility for putting      forward  a  scheme  rests  primarily on  each district,(3)   The general  conditions  must not  be  too rigid, and      lead  to  the  conclusion  that a hard  and fast  uni-      form  type  of organization will be prescribed for      each  district.  Different  conditions will suit      different  districts, and  a wide  latitude should be      allowed to meet local requirements. (4)   In  backward  districts, where no  local group  comes      forward, it  may be necessary for the Electricity      Commissioners to take action, which in an extreme      case, might  take the form of a National Power Station.      I would not  forbid this, but still less would I      encourage it, (5)   To meet the  case of backward areas in a district,      the Electricity Commissioners should have the     power either to subsidize District Authorities or     to advance them monies on favourable terms.     The District Electricity Boards should,  as a rule,     be in the nature of public authorities -  such as     the Port of London Authority - and not private     Companies working for profit.  The constituents     should be the consumers of current in the districts     and the voting power should  be proportioned  to     consumption with due regard  to the representation     of minority interests.   Seeing that as a rule     these  Boards  will  only supply Current in bulk,  the     Electorate will be 3mall,  and the business of electing     Directors will be  even less  complicated than  in the     case of a limited  liability  Company.(7)  The existing  power stations  will be bought     out by the  District Boards,  usually as the     result of negotiations.   But  they must have     powers of compulsory acquisition, the price     being  determined by arbitration.  They need not,     I suggest,  acquire any existing generating stations     that they do  not want,  so  long as these stations     are not public purveyors.  There should be nothing to(6)*
 prevent  a  private  individual or firm continuing to  generate  its  own supply if it wishes, hut if it prefers  to buy from the District Board it must, of  course, bear  the cost of scrapping its own plant. Purveyors  of power to the public are in a different category,  because the new boards will have a monopoly of  supply; hence the power must be expropriated on arbitration  terms. It would be unfair, I think to freeze them  out by competition. The capital  required by each district board should be  raised in the open market on the security of the business. I do not believe  any sub-guarantees by Borough Councils,  County Councils  or other public bodies, will be necessary,  and they introduce an undesirable complication  It  will  be  necessary, however,  before the Loan  Prospectus  is issued to make contracts over a term of years,  with the principal consumers,  on terms which will  secure the services  of the Loan. Loans should be in  the form ofDebenture Stock,  bearing a fixed rate of interest,                     W,L.  Hichens,                         108,18.
