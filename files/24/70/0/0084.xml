IP (This DocHPrent is I!His Britannic Majesty&apos;.,  CNovember  5 th ,-1918.IMORjUIDUMonPolitical Intelligence Department,             FOREIGN OP.&quot;. ICS,          Sweden /0/0.                 UNREST  IN SWEDEN *      telegrams cf the last few  days shew that Swedsn has beenpassing through what really amounts to a -political crisis broughtabout by the extreme Left Socialists.   Mr. Brant ing, who hasopenly declared his detestation  of Bolshevism and is, consequent-ly, in direct conflict with the  oxtrerae Left party, has verywisely put himself at the head of -the movement for drastic con-stitutional reforms and  has thus apparently taken the wind outof  the extreme Socialists&apos; sails. .  On the 24th  instant at agTQat meeting held at the Volks-hkas,.where he and others spoke,a Resolution was passed  demanding that the Swedish State shall become a Republic in the ovent of tho majority ef the nationdeclaring  itself bye referendum in favour of&quot; such a ohangs.Another resolution passed at  tho same meeting was in favour ofan  8-hour  working-day and demobilisation.      There is no reason to suppose that Mr. 3ranting favours.;a Republic but&apos; the*^xplanat.ion of his present attitude  is almost &apos;Certainly  that, in view  ef tha popular agitation in Sweden, hefinds it advisable to bend t.y the storm  in order not to riskbeing broken by. it.      ene  thing is quit a olpar,  namely,  that the Conservativeshave at last taken fright..    In  the course of this year theyhave succeeded in obstructing, by means  of their majority inthe Upper  House., two reform measures   the one concerning fe-male suffrage, the other relative to changes in  the municipalfranchise  which would materially affect  the composition cf  theUpper House.   Now, on the 17th  instant, at a party meetingheia to consider the present  political  situation, they  haveagreed to  vote for electoral  reforms  provided the existence
of the First Chamber is not affected.   This step was directlycalled for by the action of the present Swedish Ministry, whichtn the 15th instant stated that it intended at once to deal withthe question of franchise reform with regard to the muifcipalelections at an extraordinary session of the Riksdag, and at thenext regular session to introduce a reform bill embodying femalesuffrage.   The latter question, involving as it does, a con-stitutional change, cannot be dealt with at an extraordinarysession.      Tho standpoint of Mr. Branting (with the ModerateSocialists) and Mr. HBglund (with the Extreme Socialists) evenon paper differs fundamentally, more especially as to themethods.   The Left Socialists clamour for an immediate pro-clamatlon of a Republic and are in favour of a revolutionaryaction for its attainment.   Mr. Branting will have nothing todo with such action, maintaining that if there are to bechanges they must be brought about constitutionally-   A pro-clamation issued by the Boards of Extreme Socialist irgani-satitms and Parliamentary representatives and submitted to theGovernment puts fO&apos;rward claims far;  universal political and municipal suffrage far all men and women above 20 years of age;the suppression of the First Chamber cf the Riksdag;  of a republican constitution,  and an 8-hour working-day;  completesuppression of militarism;  the socialisation cf banks and,im-portant industrial branches;  labour control of industry;  re-duct ion of landed property owned by companies;  tho surrenderingof land to workers;  and unlimited right to demonstrations andpublic meetings.   The Board of tho Social Democratic RarVy,i.e.,  of the Moderate Socialists,  on the other hand, has pub-llshed a manifesto signed by Branting&apos;against dictatorship ofthe minority and demanding that the question cf a republican -conpjfituti^n shall be settled either by the Riksdag after newelections er by a&apos; plebiscite.   The Extreme Socialists also                        ,   -2-  1                       /put.
 puttferwar&amp;-a.proposition to  the-Moderate Socialists for Joint.^otien &quot;by the Socialists of all  the groups and the above mani- festc  of the Moderates sufficiently indicates that Mr. Branting and his followers refuse to collaborate with them in any way.       It appears then that Mr. Branting has the situation for the present well in hand - the more so ee dissension exists with- ln the  Extremist ranks, Lindhagen, Mayor of Steekholmt and others showing a disinclination to appeal to mob passion.   Though, how- ever,  the Swedish Bolsheviks have failed on this occasion in what clearly was an attempt to bring abour a revolution in Sweden, there  can be little doubt that Mr. Branting will need all his energies and abilities to cope with the spirit of unrest which is rampant.   The extent to which Bolshevism has spread in Sweden is difficult to determine, yet it is plain that the Bol- shevik elements there are gaining in strength.       An interesting report frem a secret service source gives varieus reasons for this.   It points out that for one thing the working classes are insuffie lently fed.   It is true that enormous wages are earned but rations are insufficient and Ir- regular and although any article of food can be bought at a price,  these prices are almost unbelievable.   Another cause of discontent is the inefficiency of the Pood Control Corn- mission,  which seems quite incapable of arranging an oqptitable aistrlhution of the necessities of life.       In the event of disturbances,it is further pointed out, the peasants and the workmen will be in direct conflict;  the peasants have done feery well in the War and live on the fat of the land,  consequently, the bitterness of the labouring classes in the  towns tewards them is very great.   As the peasants are numerically&apos;the stronger, there are all the flrst-ulass ele- ments  of a oivil war, should serious disturbances take place. Both in the army and the navy the unrest is very great ana this                            -g-                        /has
has been aggravated by the bad treatment of the soldiers andsailars during the influenza epidemic, when the hospital ar-rangements were totally Inadequate.      Add to all this the fact that happenings in Germany havemado a profound impression;  that the feeling is very strongagainst the bureaucracy and the wealthy classes;  and thatprincipally owing to the foolish and tactless behaviour of the queen feeling has turned against the Royal Family as a whole,the situation cannot be regarded as anything else but dis-quieting.      Still, if anyone can.ride the whirlwind it is Mr. Bran-ting.   His present line of action, the prompt introductioncf..reform measures by the Government ehd the yielding attitudeof the parliamentary Conservatives, together with the verygenuine dislike of Bolshevism In the bul  cf the Swedish nation,and the fact.; that provisions under the agreement are steadilyentering the country should work together to preserve peaceahd&quot; order.
