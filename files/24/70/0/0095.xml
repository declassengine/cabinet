The following telegram received through General BIddle fromCommanding Officer American troops in Northern Russia is repeated
Ytitn/rec emendation for your Information and consideration       &quot;Men of this command have performed most excellent&apos; servio;     under most trying climatic conditions suffering from cold     snow wet and mire marches.   Having had service in Alaska     I do not contemplate with equanimity effect on numerical     strength of command of field services in Arctic under such     primitive unsanitary conditions unless dictated urgent and     imperative military necessity.   Allied have not as yet     received the hospitality objects this expedition warranted,     certain amount of distrust motives evidently permeating     Russian mind.  Original objects of this expedition no     longer exist.    ^inter port of Archangel will be practical)]     for navigation 20 to 30 days longer and then closed until     June.  My inference is plain.  Immediate consideration     requested.                 Stewart                     Archangel.&quot;  .  I request that you inform me.   Should this matter beconsidered by Supreme War Council, of their opinion and action.Pershing.
