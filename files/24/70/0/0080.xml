II. PRESS COMMENTS.                                    (A.) Military. The Armistice.      The references in the Labour  Press to the armistice and the terms imposed upon Germany are not very numerous.  &quot; Justice &quot; is alone in ascribing victory to the superior power of the allied arms ; all the other papers being content to emphasise the disintegrating value of the German revolutionary  movement, and in light of this the  terms  imposed come in for a great deal of adverse criticism both in the &quot; Call&quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot; The &quot; Call,&quot; in an article headed  &quot; Another  Brest Litovsk,&quot; describes them  as  being in complete harmony with the Imperialist predatory nature of the war, and calls upon British Labour to disown this disgraceful act of injustice to the German people.&quot;    That the war might have been finished two years ago on terms not altogether unlike those eventually attained, and that an armistice ought certainly to have been concluded directly the Germans accepted President Wilson&apos;s terms,  is a joint thesis which  the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; is at some pains to establish.    The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; commenting on the appointment of  a  Committee to  considerbreaches of the Law and Customs of War and  of the responsibility attaching to certain members of the German forces, proceeds to suggest an appropriate Tribunal before which not only German, but also allied culprits, might be brought.

                                 (B.) Foreitju Affairs. The Revolutions.      The Revolution in the  Central European countries is  warmly  welcomed, and the &quot; Herald &quot; breaks forth into a psoan of delight.      &quot; In the last wonderful week events have outstripped our wildest hopes   .  .   .  the old order is crashing about our ears and the ground is being swiftly cleared for the building of the new Europe.  The red flag is flying from the North Sea to the  aegean;  from the Pyrenees to the Urals there is no throne left  .  .   .  the essential thing is that these are no bourgeois revolutions, but the Social revolution  .  .  .  Central Europe is  delivering itself not only from autocracy but from plutocracy, not only from its war lords but from the gold lords  .  .   .  The vanquished in Avar are reaping  a glorious harvest what  of the victors ? &quot;     It is anticipated that any attempt to confine  the Revolution to Central Europe must necessarily fail.  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; for instance, thinks that Italy and France will go next and who will say that the revolutionary wave will not even engulf Great Britain ? &quot; We could certainly manage a revolution as well as Germany and we may be riper for  it than our victory-exalted rulers think.&quot;  Robert Williams in the &quot; Herald &quot; goes so far as to suggest that the Special Labour Party Conference should constitute itself a Committee of public safety with Robert Smillie as Controller of Coal Production and  Distribution, with Mr. Thomas as Director of Railways and Mr.  Gosling of Shipping operations.  With the single exception of &quot; Justice,&quot; all the papers unite in demanding the withdrawal of the Allied troops from Russia, and point out that similar action  may shortly be taken by Capitalist Governments under pretence of maintaining order in Austria  and Germany. Mr. Brailsford claims that our first duty is to secure that food shall go into Germany without any political condition, the second that the Internationale shall meet at  once.   He also advocates the evacuation  of Russia and the establishment  of friendly  relations with the new democracy of Germany. Russia.     &quot; Forward &quot; prints an article on the Russian intervention,  in  which it claims that intervention is exclusively in the interests of the Capitalists and it quotes from the speech of Mr. Leslie Urqnhart at the meeting of the Irtysh Corporation in  support  of this view. The &quot;Call &quot; continues its defence of the Soviet Government, and the reply  of M. Tchit- cherine to a neutral protest  on the subject of the Red Terror is given in full.  The support of  the Russian Bolshevists is a question transcending all others in its importance, especially for Labour in this country.                                 (C.) Home Affairs. Labour and the Coalition.     There is complete unanimity in favour of the withdrawal of Labour from the Coalition. The &quot; Herald &quot; backs up the claim by declaring that the position of Labour in the Govern- ment has never been one  of co-operation but of subjugation. Labour, as a party, will have power only if it is vigilant and free, and a fighting minority has infinitely more power than a party, however large, that is condenmed and betrayed from the beginning.  In another  article the same  paper criticises in the most drastic manner the Labour  members of the Government.  Each and all, they have defended  or excused every action taken by the  Government against  the workers.   The Coalition bas disgracefully  neglected the maimed, the bruised, the widowed and the orphan.  It has  been weighed in the balance and found wanting.  In this case the opinion is expressed that reconstruction is j ust the one  question  upon which Labour must part company with the Capitalist parties and politicians. Demobilisation.     The &quot;  Herald &quot; considers that the temporary wages  and  unemployment benefit provided during the period of demobilisation are utterly inadequate in view of the present level of prices. Political Prisoners.     The demand for the release of political prisoners is continued by the &quot; Herald &quot; andthe &quot; Call &quot; especially.  The amnesty, in the &quot; Herald&apos;s &quot; opinion, should not be  confined to the C.O.&apos;s, the Irish, John Maclean, but should also include all military prisoners, allinterned  aliens and Indian political prisoners.
                              III. DISTKICT REPORTS. London and South Eastern.     It is reported that ail workers at WoolwicK are now on day work.  Those who have hitherto been on piecework are already grumbling at the inadequacy ol the wages paid at time  rates.     McManus, addressing a meeting  at Woolwich, urged the  Workers to form a committee such as the Clyde Workers Committee, in order to be prepared to take control of industry when the time comes.     A &quot; Reunion of Rebels &quot; meeting was held at Holborn on November 9th.  McManus, Watson  and Eden Paul spoke.   The Clyde and London Districts were stated to be ready for the revolution and the total abolition of the Monarchy was agreed  upon.     There is a good  deal of unrest reported at Park Royal  where  a number of firms are declining to pay for the time lost on November 11th and 12th.   The Government grant of 24s. to unemployed men is causing great dissatisfaction, and it is reported that the men are about to ask for  5 a week for all. bona fide workers who become unemployed. West Midlands.               ,                      *.     It is reported that many munition workers are already being discharged at Birmingham,&apos; while others are being put on half  time.  This is causing considerable indignation and the workers declare that the Government unemployment allowance is inadequate to live upon. Among those discharged are some ex-service men ;  their case is being taken up by the local Federation of Discharged and  Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers.     At  Coventry also, dissatisfaction  is expressed  at  the inadequate unemployment allowance.  Further,  there is a demand for the abrogation of D.O.R.A. Yorkshire  and East Midlands.     There is little unrest reported from this area.     The trouble in the lace trade at  Nottingham  continues, although there is no stoppage of work  at the present moment.     Some discontent is being aroused among the steel smelters at Sheffield owing to the delay on the part of  the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation in dealing with grievances. It is said that there are 30 or 40 claims outstanding.     It is reported that Gallacher has been speaking at Sheffield and Barrow on the subject of John Maclean&apos;s release. North Western.     Conditions are normal again in this district.   The strikes reported last week have been settled.     A meeting of the Liverpool Shop Stewards is reported to have been held on November 7th, under the auspices of the  Mersey Reconstruction Committee.   John Finnegan, who presided, said that the workers had lost the  opportunity afforded by the war to obtain reforms, because they would not  support the Reconstruction Committee, but still clung to the antiquated official element. Northern.     It is reported from Newcastle that a strong movement is being organised to obtain a working week of 44 hours in the engineering and shipbuilding yards. Wales.     A meeting is stated to have been held at Ynyshir, on November 10th, to celebrate the anniversary of the Russian Revolution.   The  Chair was taken by G.  Dolling, and Noah Abblett  made  a  revolutionary  speech.. Scotland.     Some activity is reported on the part of the Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council in Glasgow. At a recent meeting it was suggested to invite Lloyd George to be the first President of a British republic.     There is continued agitation for the release of John Maclean.  It is suggested in some quarters that his release at the moment would go  far to allay discontent, especially  on the Clyde.
G. H.  roberts.                                   IV.-DISPUTES.     The labour situation is very satisfactory at the present time, but the discharge of munition workers has begun,  and trouble is already threatening  owing to the  allegedinadequacy of the unemployment benefit.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work..     The Admiralty Labour Department reports that  most establishments closed down onMonday, 11th November, on the signing ol the armistice, and remained closed for the greaterpart of the week.   There have been no fresh stoppages from other causes.            The strike of the 200 shipwrights and drillers at Harland and Wolffs, Bootle, reported last        week, is now ended.     The Ministry of  Munitions reports that 725 workers were on strike and five strikesremained unsettled on November 13th.            One&apos;of the strikes in progress is that at the American Assembling Factory (Hollinwood)        and two other establishments. This was due to the removal of a partition by the superintendent,        a piece of work which the men considered should have been done by the contractors.     The Goal Controller reports seven new stoppages for the week ending November 19th.In three cases work has already been resumed.            The strike  at the Lancaster  Steam Coal Company&apos;s pits, reported last week, ended on        November 13th, the settlement reached being  in the men&apos;s favour.     The War Office Contracts department reports one fresh stoppage.            A strike has occurred at Messrs. Stammers &amp; Co., Walsall, owing to the dismissal of six        members of the United Garment Workers&apos; Union.     There is considerable unrest in  the woollen trade in Ireland.   Two strikes, one atthe Convoy and one at the Kilkenny Woollen Mills, have been in progress for a considerablenumber of weeks.  The  matters in dispute have recently been referred to arbitration.Reported from other Sources.     A strike of steel smelters has occurred at Middlesbrough, which shows signs of extension.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work     The Admiralty Labour Department reports no cases of importance.     The Ministry of Munitions reports one case.            Messrs. Shanks &amp; Co. (Barrhead) have received a demand from the Scottish Brass Moulders        Union that time work should be immediately substituted in the place of piecework, which has        been the prevailing method of payment in their establishment for 40 years.     The Coal Controller  reports that  the South  Wales Miners have agreed to  follow thepolicy of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and postpone action in connection with the surface  workers&apos; demand for shorter hours until December 5th.    The War Office Contracts Department reports no cases.   .     The Committee on Production heard 43 cases in London during the past week.     These included an application by the National  Amalgamated Union of Enginemen,Firemen, Mechanics,  &amp;c, employed in engineering  firms  in the Leeds district, for a 53-hours&apos; Week and engineers&apos; rates for overtime,  nightwork.  &amp;c.
