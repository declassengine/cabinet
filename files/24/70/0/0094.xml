THE STATE OF imAjg).I.Report by Lord French.26.11.18II.Report by General OfficerCoimianding-in-Chief  theForces in Ireland,7,11.18.III.Report by Inspector-13 * 11 * 18.General, Royel Irish Con-stabulary, for month ofOctober, 1918.Report on Activities ofExtremists coring monthof October, 1918.  -     During the month of October the activity of Sinn Feinin preparing for the coming Election continued and increased.     Tho compact between this Association and the TransportWorkers1 Union became definitely established, the TransportWorkers&apos; Union agreeing to v/ithdraw their candidates for parliamentary Election and to give their undivided support to Sinn Fein.     Tho Country io quiet on the surface, and the continuedsuccesses of the Allies increased the difficulties of SinnFein in maintaining general enthusiasm.     However, there has been increasing activity on the partof tho Extremists, i.e. the Irish Volunteers,   Thcso em-brace the old Physical Force Party and tho extreme element of Sinn Fein., and have in view complete separation from england,  :   -  It will need very firm and careful handling to ensureagainst the  spread of the Extremist movement.   Now that thewar  is  over,, they are watching for troubles  in England toassist  them  in  their pernicious endeavours.I.Report by lord French.This.
     This Aooociation exorcises a terrorising effect inparta of the country where tho community&quot;. havooievsr^eenable to  develop even a modicum of moral courago.     An instance of their organisation and daring is mani  -fested in the forcihlo roleaoo of a member of their Associa-ticn wha was Incarcerated in Cork Jail awaiting his trialfor ohooting a policeman.     Any relaxation for seme time tc come of the present strictadministration, cf tho law would threw the country hack into acondition from which it could only bo rescued by active maili-tary aotion,     It is sincerely hrped that after the Elections the csun-try will begin to realiso that their lest interests lie ra-thftr in the direction of internal development and progress,than in continuing to follow thoeo whom,  in the excitementof the moment,  they have mistaken for sane thinkers.     Put we have direct evidence of the underlying forces ofrebellion and disorder in the successful attempts which aromade from time to time to defy the law.     The incident at Amiens Street Station, Dublin, in Augustlast, when half a ten of high explosives, under the charge ofthe police, was seized;  and the very recent affair at CorkJail are caeoo in point.     Thoy ohow that the country at present is in no way fit for any form of Solf-government   indeed the situation  callsf*r careful inquiry into the practical efficiency of tho&quot;fiastle Hulo&quot; which obtains at present.                          .

...                              ii iCopy of letter from the General Officer Commanding-in-     Chief ,  tho Forces in Ireland,  to Lord French.                                      7th November, 1918. YOUR EXCELLENCY,          I have tho honour&apos; to vsubm.it the following report on the general conditions in Ireland during the month of October in so far as they beer upon Military Dispositions in the Country t- . CTJffUL 31&apos;i.TS OF THE COUNTRY-.         . I have no information regarding the general state of the Country whieh has not already been made known to Your Excellency through the Police Reports.          Though disturbances, due to the enforcement of the Military Service Act, cannot now be feared, I am of the opinion that disturbances may be organised by the extreme party with the object of keeping themselves and their cause before the public.    The danger is that these extremists may be able to intimidate those who hold milder views. MILITARY SERVICE ACT,          The, Country expected Conscription last month and I am convinced that if the Order  in Counoil had been laid on the table of the  House the day it assembled there would, have teen practically&apos;no disturbances  and the Act could have been enforced, from a Military point of view, without much difficulty.          In ease of disturbances and so as to test the orders I had issued I enjoined Special &quot;Vigilance on the 15th Oct. The arrangements, except in a few minor.details, worked well and I ordered a resumption of Normal conditions on 17th October. HOSTILE ACTIONS.          Raiding- for Arms, which had beoome rare and spssmodlo underwent a sudden revival towards the middle of tho month:  &apos; the same was true,  -in a lesser degree, of Illegal drilling..          Hostility, towards the Police has continued extremely bitter throughout;   feelings against the Military, though a good deal less bitter than against the Police, were apparent. A few attacks on Soldiers were made, either to seize their Arms-or  to bring ridicule upon them:  one or two casee occurred, of malicious  destruction of  Stores, and attempted damage to Government property. SIM FEIN ORGANISATION AND IRISH VOLUNTEER ACTIVITY,          A number of meetings of the .Sinn Fein Executive were held.during the month, some  of these were mainly occupied with/the electoral campaign:   others were evidently oeoupied with,&apos;plans for  rebel hostilities:&apos;  meetings were held of officers from the Headquarters of Brigadoe and Battalions, on the oon- conclusion  of whieh an important seizure of papers    was made by.the Polios from certain  prominent Volunteers (notably from CARLO?,), which showed that careful plans had been made for offensive  operations &quot;on orders to strike being received&quot;. These were to  include extensive destruction of the Railway Line; seizure  of Police Barracks,  Railways Stations, Post Offioee and other  points of vantege:   the enforcement of &quot;strict mlli- tary law&quot;;   oommandeering of Motor Transport;  destruction of EXCELLENCY,THT1 LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND,
Crops, Sto roe,  Roads and Bridges;   construct!on of TvonchesBarricades;  the burning of a Military Camp,  and Klie setting upof Food Committees for the Civil popuXution.       The paper AN T&apos;OGLACH, the  BO called official organ ofthe Irish Volunteers,  has again been secfetly printed and circulated since August.   The number dated September 30th,states in a leading article that all those who accept the irish republican Ideal will be .required.....&quot;to enlist in the Army ofIreland and fight for self defence&quot;.       The number dated October 14th. contains, under tho title&quot;Ruthless Warfare&quot;, a violent incitement to Bolshevism;  itpreaches the elimination of passive resistance, stating that&quot;in our resistance we shall acknowledge no limit and no scruple...... any civilian or soldier who assists (Conscription) shouldbe killed without mercy or hesitation an opportunity offers.....       Though we know to a certain extent the distribution ofthe Sinn Fein Brigades and Battalions, we hardly.know for certainthe name of a single Brigade or Battalion Commander,   Thegreatest care is&apos; taken*to keep the names secret and so far it isonly accidentally that we havo discovered any.MILITARY MEASURES.       The Proclamation of the West Riding of Cork as aMilitary Area appears to have come as a complete surprise tomost of the inhabitants;  it included the prohibition of markets and fairs, and the local press was full of indignationon account of the wide extent of the Area proclaimed.   It is too soon as yet to state the effective results of this measure.VULNERABLE POINTS.       The Naval Vulnerable Points in this Command haverecently been inspected by a representative of the Staff of the admiral, Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland-,, in company, withan Offioer from my Staff, with a view to reorganizing the defensive arrangements and economizing man-power.ARMS.       Since my last  report  large numbers of arms have beenplaced under military control by the Ulster Volunteers and bythe Nationalists  in Ulster.   I am not, however, altogethersatisfied that the effect of the order prohibiting the havingof arms of all kinds  is understood, by everybody in the countieslately brought under  the order.   Though a considerable numberof rifles have been placed under Military  control by Loyalpeople, $et a large number still remain  in the possession  of civilians, and very few  shot guns have been either handed  inor Permits applied for.UNITED STATES FORCES.       Correspondence has recently passed  between GeneralBiddle,  Commanding American  Expeditionary  Forces, London,  theWar Offioe  and myself,  regarding  the action  of the UnitedStates Troops in  Ireland in  aafee  of eventualities.       The  principles have  been agreed upon  and approved-bythe Army Council.STRENGTH OF TROOPS.        The position in  Ireland as on the last complete week ofOctober  is summarized as under

/part II  POLITICAL         Unionist Societies were inactive.  The arms and ajnmunW-^ [ACTIVITY.    tion which the Ulster Volunteer  Force have been calling in      ----    for some time past, are now assembled under military control in              premises at Belfast.                   These Volunteers ware estimated to rave in their poss-              esslon about 50,000 rifles of mixed pattern and there is              reason to believe that a considerable number have been hand-              ed over to Military custody.                   Little activity was displayed by the Constitutional              Rationalists.                   Meetings ware held at St Mary&apos;s Hall, Belfast, where              Mr. Devlin wa;: again selected as Parliamentary representative              and a sum of  1,500 was subscribed for the General Election              Fund, and at Louahbrickland, Co. Down, together with some              smeller getheringa at other places.                   A Meeting advertised to be hold at Carrick ****me.cross in              Mcnaghan on November 1st at which Mr. Devlin was to have              spoken, has been postponed sine die, ostensibly on account              of the influenza opider.de; but it is suspected that the real              res son of the postponement is reluctance ta apply for a per-              mit in the belief that later on permits will be dispensed              with in the c ?e cf election meetings.                   The Irish Parliamentary Party has, however, manifestly              lost its dominating influence aver the  electorate, and it              is noticeable that what little activity was displayed by its              supporters was practically confined to the Province of              Ulster^                   Sinn Fein, thouah holding its own, made no  tisible              prog;ess.                   The number of Sinn Fein Clubs increased from 1,338 to              1,341,.&apos;but the membership va s not appreciably affected and              remained on 31st Oct. approximately 111,0.0.                   As it gradually,became apparent  that the Germans were.              beaten the. dread of Conscription  subsided, and with it a              good deal of  the enthusiasm for Sinn  Fein.                   The Bonprid annual Ard pads or Sinn Fein Convention took              place at tha  Mansion House, Dublin,  on October  29th and 30th.,              and was attended by delegates from the s  veral  County              executives.                   Mr De Valors  (interned) was  re-elected  President,  and  ,              Kr Arthur Griffith (interned) and the Rev. Father  0fFlanagan              were re-elected Vice-Presidents.   Nine of the old  Executive              Council ware  re-elected,  and new  members  (of whom -:.  aro              priests) W:..ae elected  to  fill the places  of  the  remaining              14 who are  either  entcrned  or imprisoned.

Because they will not ask for permits in compliance with the Commandor-in-Chiof&apos;s Order under L.a.,.w9 A.A*,the Sinn Poiners have discontinued thuir open . ir meetings... t which it was customary to discuss tho raovemtnt andits oolloy, and this couplud with the fact that they willscarcely sneak to a member of the R.I.C. makes it incroas-ingly difficult to obtain information.     The defeat of the German Army whioh they had believed to be impossible was an embarrassing surprise, but they now expect America to su --port their claim for independenceat the Peace Conference, end meanwhile, are devoting all their energies to  )roo.ration for the General Election..     About 70 candidates, most of whom arc at-  resent in-terned or imprisoned have already been selected, and re-lying on the popular sympathy evoked by their un.com-promising hostility to Conscription,, thev -re confident of victory on the polling day.     At a Labour Congress held ,,t the Mansion house, Lublinit was decided b  an overwhelming majority to withdrawlabour candidates who had boon selected for provinoialconstituencies in favour of Sinn Feiners, which ma:: be re-garded as a further indication of liaison botwoon SinnFein and labour.

12 -       The Irish Volunteers,  sometimes called the irish republican Army, is now practically a Secret Society..       Drilling and, public parades have been suppressed,, butevidence was,afforded during  the Month of active organization,and although the republican movement, ad admitted by speakersat the Ard Feie on 29th and 30th. ult. , is seriously handicapped/and has to curtail its plans  on account of the deportation ofthe principal leaders, there  must bo several dangerous revoluv&quot;tionists still secretly at work.       Ho reliable estimate of the numerical strength of thisVolunteer Force is available, but it may be assumed to embraceall the younger members of the Sinn Fein Clubs,  and the moatfanatical Sinn Feiners.       A secret convention, attended by some 40 delegates fromthe country, was held at Gardiner *o &apos;&amp;lace, Dublin, on October19th.       Papers discovered in the house of a provincial suspectby the R.I.C. show that the delegates v/ere- summoned to a -certain house in the City where they would receive cardsdirecting them to the place of meeting, but no information as -to the business transacted has yet been obtained.       In the course of searching suspected houses for arms -inpursuance of the Commander-in-Chief1sr order of Sept.28th. thepolice have discovered quantities of sporting cartridges inwhich the shot has been replaced by heavy leaden slugs;  -gelignite; and some ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder;  and other powdered substances which are being analysed.       They have, ilso found papers  in relation to extensiveorganization of Volunteer brigades, battalions, and companies,and elaborate arrangements.for communication by despatch riders,etc., together&apos;with-mobilization orders, dated October 10th,,-evidently for the purpose of resisting Conscription, and detailed instruct ions for making bombs.       On October 10th. 7 cases, containing 84 dummy Mills -bomb^consigned to. the Military were stolen from Traliee rr.ilwaystation.&apos;       On Ootober 31st. 19 lbs, of Gelignite, were found, on therack of an..empty railway carriage at Limerick,&apos;- presumably leftthere by a delegate /returning from the Ard Feia in Dublin, -       According to a report  from the Naval Authorities whichis to some extent corroborated by the local police,-flasheswere observed from a craft supposed to be a submarine and the shore on the night of October 28th. in Killala Bay.       Although perhaps,tho majority of those,in the ranks.ofSinn Fein and the Irish Volunteers only joined for protection against Conscription, a considerable number, including -someyoung priests, are undoubtedly republican fanatics.  .       At a Sinn Fein Executive meeting at Ballinasloevon  -October 6th., after Wm. Hellowes, rebel and refugee in America,had been chosen as Parliamentary candidateReft, Fr. Deignan,CO. is reported to have said - &quot;Melloweo- ia no-r the republicancandidate for East Galway, and it must be clear that we areout for a republic and not for any.Colonial Home Rule.&quot;
       In their-conception of England&apos;s difficulty affordingthe opportunity to shake off British rule by force of arms,the republican leaders have not limited their outlook toopportunities afforded by the. VTar, but have contemplated the possibility of industrial upheaval and disturbance inEngland whieh might enable them to achieve their object.      &apos; I submit that the foregoing statement shows a dangerous state of. disaffection in the ocuntry, and thenecessity for the continuance cf firm&apos;measures and themaintenance of a strong Military force.

KggOKT OK ACTIVITIES OF EXTREMISTS DURING MONTH OF OCTOBER.  1918. Dublin Metropolitan Police,      Detective Department,           DUBLIN.4th.,  November, 1918.     I beg to state that Sinn Fein activities duringthe month of October were mainly confined toelectioneering work,     Some dissatisfaction, however, exists owing to thedecision of the Irian Executive of the Trades UnionCongress to run Labour Candidates at the next GeneralElection, and great efforts are being made to bring abouta compromise so as to enable Sinn Fein to obtain the fullBupport of the working classes.     Industrial unrest is now practically ended and the few disputes still unsettled aro not of such a natureas to give cause for the slightest alarm.     The Conscription Conference resumed its sittingsin the Mansion House in the early part of the month.An appeal is said to have been sent out to Parish Cora-mittees not tn relax thoir vigilance as the danger ofthe Military Service Act being applied to Ireland wasnot yet ever.     Several Recruiting meetings were held in various districts of the Metropolis.   The speakers, as a rule,wero favourably received.   There is, however, very littleimprovement,  and the number enlisted in the Dublin area so far is 2591.     A secret Conference of Sinn Fein  Volunteers tookplace at Fleming&apos;s Hotel, Gardiner&apos;s Place,  on night of19th October.   About 40 delegates were present.   As theOrder in Council had not then been tabled,  it is saidthat their plans to a fight it were not disclosed, butCompany Commanders were requested to be ready if called on.     The Annual Sinn Fein Convention was held in theMansion House on 29th October.   Some 500 delegates werepresent.-   The Rev. M, 0&apos;Flanagan presided,  and on the concluding day those taking part marched through someOf the principal streets to College Green where theabove named gentleman delivered a ohort speech.   Policeaction resulted in the freaking up of the meeting whenthe people concerned returned to the Mansion House in    ordinary faBhion.,     There are now 23 Sinn Fein Clubs in the MetropolitanPolice Area,  with an approximate membership of 4640.     Several meetings of the Executive of Sinn Feintook place at 6, Harcourt Street since the beginningof the month, but  the business,  as already indicated,was mostly relating to organising matters in connectionwith the impending General Election.No
No arms have been unlawfully imported and no case of illegal drilling has come to the notice of the Police for some weeks past.
