T/l      I  bog to  confirm the  following  wire  sent  to  you to-day:-r           &quot;T/l,  November 23rd.    In  continuation  of corres-^     pondenoe  ending  with  your  7123,II,E,2,A,642,  dated 19th inst.      Following resolution  was adopted at  yesterday meeting of      Inter-Allied Transportation  Council  :-           Tho  Inter-Allied Transportation Council having      received  from the French Representative .an intimation that      the. French  Government have1 decided that the  transport of      coal  to Italy by rail must be stopped from the loth      December, the Council are  of opinion that  tho  following      questions:-           A.   The aggregate requirements  of  Italy in coal           B,   Sources of supply           C   Method  of transportation           D,   Necessity for maintaining a strategic  reserve                  of coal in Italy      should be comprehensively  reviewed by delegates of the      Governments  ooncorned,&apos; representing all the interests,      including the Inter-Allied Transportation Council, in the      same  manner as was done in London on Jar oh 3.3th, 1918, when      the existing agreement, which the minister of  Public Works,      Paris, can  no longer  continue,  was drawn up.    Until tho      above  mentioned  date.,  the  15th  December,  the  supply will      continue  in aecordance with  the agreement of tho 13th Jaroh      1918,  to  the  extent rendered possible by  the  return of      rolling stock.   Resolution  ends.           General transportation  situation in France undoubtedly      renders necessary suspension of all-rail  delivery of coal      to Italy  at earliest  possible date.   I strongly recommend      that  Allied. Maritime  Council should  summon a meeting to dis-      cuss  this question and at which all  interests  should be      represented, in exactly the same ,7 ay  as meeting was held in      March  last.   Please send copy of above resolution to      allied Maritime  Council urging, if you. agree,  the course      advocated by me.  Fuller particulars follow  by letter&quot;.      It will be  seen  that  the French Authorities,  due to the undoubted  serious situation generally of  transportation inFrance, have intimated that they  will not transport  coal toItaly by the all-rail route after the- 15th December  next., inother words they aro  not prepared after that date  to fulfil the tripartite agreement made in  London on march  13th, 1918,when  the following programme of delivery  of coal  to  italy was accepted :-               3y all-rail  route           9,0UU tons  a day.               By rail-cum-sea route       6,000 tons  a day.               By all-sea route            5,000 tons a day.      This  is equivalent to a delivery of  600,000  tons per month,which was  computed to be the minimum requirement  of  Italy, ofwhich 350,000  tons wore to be from French sources,  and,250,000tons  from England.    The replacement by English coal  of tho350,000 tons of  French coal was also arranged.
     Duo to various reasons the arrangement has not beencirrloci out and the result has been that,  in order to make upas far as possible the deficiency in rail  borne coal from french sources, the delivery of English coal by  11-soa routehas boen increasec!.     For military reasons a strategic reserve of Knglish coal(150,000 tons) was accumulated in Italy by all-sea delivery,and. has been in existence oihoe September  lost.     Due to the serious transportation situation in Franco therehas been continued deficiency in tho tonnage of coal delivered by the all-rail route compared with the programme, and theInter-wllied Transportation Council have from time to timerecommended the necessity of further increasing the deliveriesby all-sea route, in order to relieve tho  railways.   these recommendations were made on tho 17th July, a,iain en the 23rdAugust, and on the 21st October,   The Allied maritime transport council have not so far been able to accept these recommenda-tions.     The Inter-Allied Transportation Council have now receivednotification from the French Representative to the effect that-oho Minister of Public Uorks does not consider it  ) issiblo tocontinue beyond the 15th December next, the organisation  for the transportation of coal as laid down in tho agreement made inLondon on the 13th March, 1918,    A copy of the FrenchRe resentative13 note is attached, containing the reasons whichhave necessitated the Minister of Public Lories arriving at thisdecision.     The Inter-allied Transportation Council have been given tounderstand, in t]v course of discussion on this subject attheir meeting on November 15th last, that in any case  increaseddeliveries of coal by sea from Great Britain to Italy  cannotbe realised before January 1919, and, it is inferred therefrom,that there is little likelihood of the delivery by sea of thewhole  jrogramme  (600,000 tons), if at all, until a later date,but certainly not by December 15th next,.   Tho suspension of deliveries of coal by the all-rail and &quot;cabotage&quot; routes  onDecember 15th, without the possibility of replacement  bydeliveries by sea, would have the effect of reducing currentdeliveries oi coal to Italy, at present considerably belowthe agreed programme by, say one-third.     The sudden weakening of Italy&apos;s position  in the matter  ofcoal resources has,  it is su gested,.a military aspect, insomuchthat on  the 12th November last&apos; the Military Representatives  onthe Supreme war  Council  in their Joint lie to No. 40,  statedtheir  opinion  that the strategic reserve of co.-;l mentioned  above,must be  maintained to meet possible military contingencies,  andis not  now available  for ordinary use.     The French  Rep  esentative  on  the  Inter-Allied  TransportationCouncil  explains  that at the  present time, tlie transportationposition of Prance is growing  rapidly worse, due  to  the following reasons  :-     A,   Necessity  of revictual]ing the civil population in            newly  occupied areas,     B.   Longer  laid for militrry  traffic.:
Delfly to rolling stock in forward areas,  consequent  on imperfect and weak railway communication.As a result, the French Representative stated that Uaroohal FOCHhad boon informed that it was not possible for the French Roseauxto handle cortain essential military traffic which he had orderedthem to do.   Until the rolling etock to bo delivered to theAllies under the terms of the Armistice is handed over,  and moreparticularly until adequate railway communication betwoon the newareas and existing railways in France is accomplished, I cannot see that any improvement can tajce plaoe.     Tho French, Italian and American Representatives on theInter-Allied Transportation Council appear to think that theserious transportation situation en the Continent is not fully understood by those who control tho allocation of shipping, andthat the latter are not convinced of the absolute neoessity ofshipping interests relieving land transportation on the  Continentin this crisis.   The Inter-Allied Transportation Council, there-fore, and I am in entire agreement with  thorn, have strongly uraadin the of st, and do so now with greater insistence, thatcontinental railways shall be relieved of the transport  of coalby rail to Italy.     There are so many interests involved in this matter, that Iam convinced that no satisfactory solution can be found  except bya meeting at which all those interested are representedt   Such amooting took oalce in March, 1916, when the agreement which theFrench Authorities are no longer able to fulfil was drawn up, -ndI strongly urge that the Allied Maritime Council, who arranged theprevious meeting in March, should assemble another Conferenceon the same linos forthwith.(Signed)     .A.M.NASH. 1*1. QVI.G.-T.PARIS,   23rd November,  1918.
Inter-Allied Transport        Council,                              PARIS,     Pren* h Sect ion.      No. 732/CI.T.                     November  21st,  1918.Note on. the Supply of Coal to Italy *     After consultation x1th the Minister of Public Works and transportation,  I should like to make the following remarksprior to our Meeting of the 22nd November,  as regards trans-uortation of coal for Italy either from French mines or fromthe GIRONPS Ports.1.    The transit ovor French lines of coal for Italy was      accepted at a time when sea transport, being exposed to      ihe dangers of submarine warfare, stood in need of relief;      this danger having been removed, tho opportunity arises      to revert to the previous etate of things.  Moreover, the      decrease in imports of war material or raw material for      war manufactures must have made available fresh resources      in tonnage.2,    The present situation of the Prench Reseaux is a very      serious reason to be added to tho above considerations.      The supply.of the liberated territories (Nortn of France,      Alsace-Lorraine, Belgium) , ar^tha increased lead for mi 11-      tary supplies impose a very/strain, against which no fresh      resources can so far be eet.  Luring the last few days the      Reseaux of the Interior have lost 20,000 wagons which have      passed into Belgium or on  to lines recently restored,      Essential military transportation has had to be refused,3,    in these circumstances, the Minister of Transportation does      not consider it possible  tc continue beyond the 15th      December the organisation  for the transportation of coal      as laid down in che agreement made at London on 13th March,      ,1918,  Un.il that date, transportation of cool will be   ,  / effected from tho French  mines, but  only  to the extent      rendered possible by the  restitution of coal trucks by italy       which restitution, according to the  terms of the above-      mentioned agreement, should be made  unit  by unit.      To summarise, it was possible to effect the supply of coal toItaly almost entirely by sea up to the end of 1917, at a time whenthe  submarine war was at its height;   it would  be inconceivable thit should be impossible to revert  to  that  state of things  after thcessation of the  submarine danger  and  the  decrease of war  imports.As.regards the situation of the  railways,  it has become worse  in italy as well as  in France, and if no relief is afforded,  coaltransportation will fail of itself owiru to the lack of resources,(Signed)    US HSNAFF.
